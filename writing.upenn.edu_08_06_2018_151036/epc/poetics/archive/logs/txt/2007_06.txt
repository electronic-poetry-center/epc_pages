To all you publishers out there--check this out. Sabato is amazing. I don't know this book but his "On Heroes and Tombs" is certainly one of the greatest novels of the second half of the 20th century. I've also read the three other books of his that have been translated (a novel, The Angel of Darkness; a novella, The Tunnel; and a collection of essays, The Writer in the Catastrophe of Our Time) and they are all worth seeking out too--though none appears to be currently in print.

Happy Birthday, Walt -- May 31

Last night we gathered in Washington Park, at the Robert Burns Statue,
to celebrate Walt Whitman's birthday by reading "Song of Myself".
There were 12 readers sharing the duties while others wandered in &
out, with their dogs, their babies, their ice cream cones, just to
listen for a short or long while.

The long lines, the images from everyday life, the musings on
philosophy, spirituality, the pure celebration of occupation,
procreation, loafing resonated under the trees & on the grass while
Robert Burns looked down from his perch.  The multiple voices brought
to life Walt's vision of democracy & diversity, the true greatness of
America in its people.

"If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles."

Thank you to our readers Sylvia, Sally, Therese, Miriam, Mimi, Robin,
Rebecca, Bob, Noah, Sue, & Marty.

See you all again next year -- & in the meantime, look for the schedule
of Poets in the Park, 7PM, Saturdays in July, again under the shadow of
Robert Burns in Washington Park, Albany.

This is as close as I can get: "I caught sight of a splendid Misses.

Howdy Brian, dbc, CA and who all else--


  I suppose what interests me most about this discussion as a person with a somewhat limited vested interest, but enough so to have at least one whole issue of a literary journal dedicated to attacking me and Pavement Saw about Ed Dorn, is the idea that the more current poems are in some way invalid. While I have not read the current edition, tho I am grateful to have Dale Smith as writer as the forward (on principle), and Michael Rothenberg as editor (because he, unlike the Chicago Review, is not a dabbler who has decided it is fashionable to run SOMETHING because ED died and is famous). Let me back that up, CR has shown recently, unfortunately, they are not interested in political poems unless they are by someone of accepted note, their entire tone has went to silence, in poetry that promotes inaction and is out of step with the needs of the current age. As our gas prices hit $3.49 and George Bush heads towards another record year of addition to his family's income I find
 CR's inaction a suspect device in the stream of things. This is not to say they are entirely at fault but do they really think that the political power of poetry is irrelevant and unheard by others? Perhaps they should join Dana Gioia or the more recent meanderings of Dana Goodyear and Daisy Fried in their lack of understanding of why poetry can matter especially in the political realm.


  The current poems I read in Ed Dorn's Etruscan edition as well as my friends at Limberlost, which I assume, between the two, is the majority of the new material being pointed at, hit me as having a ticker tape on the bottom and the top, with crosses at times, the same as we experience watching CNN, or, forgive me, Fox News, except, instead of exposing a Gay Teletubby, the lines above and below actually point toward underlying concerns about a problem rather than exuding a paid for perpetuated conservative agenda. The poem couched within is one of symbol, one that is free within the top and bottom headlines that couch its meaning and moment.


  Back to Dale, his words follow his actions, not only did he substantially invest in ED, but also in Carl Thayler as PSP did and Brian for that matter, even though I think each of us knew what we were getting involved in, a controversial long shot whose political beliefs and a number of other things were continually questioned and attacked. I made this choice because I thought the poems would long outlive the resonance of the man; even tho I am composed of belief structures that created well known difficulties between Carl and I before his passing. Juvenal could have been a total jew hating satanist as far as I am concerned, what does this matter at this remove? Or Cardenal, or Gavaudan, or Sordello? Not to say that Ed is guilty, but is treated as a corpus vile, nearly all of the voices rallying against him so far have been suspect and intricately steeped in poetic politics. Most appear to be those who would gain from tainting his name. If we know WCW is guilty, so what?
 Does it really add any direct meaning or should we fault those fuzzy things in the background? Well, I have had enough of them.


  In addition, the whole Duke U Gunslinger is, in my opinion, a jest, a sad re-fashioning of history which is parallel to Ted Berrigan's Penguin version of the Sonnets. If you are in conflict with someone through out your life then I believe you do not wait until they die to retract the fangs; some of the positive items being said are outright disturbing if you knew the surrounding information about Ed or Ted or Hannah or Gil or whomever. In this situation a group of post partum parties got involved who were, at the very least, against Ed and said a substantial amount of negative material about the man, then suddenly decided it was in their best interest to "renegotiate" their beliefs.


  To take it one step further, that Frontier Press vested their whole ass, not just a partial cheek, into the project seems a very relevant point of Brian's; Joanne Kyger gave me a copy of a number of the individual collections, Winter Book, 24 songs, the cycle, I forget what else, as there were copies left when Harvey Brown died because of how deep they were in their commitment. I like that fact that I am able to be that committed to an author myself, that I am not one of the flyboys (and yes they are mostly boys and poetically cute at that, but only in a surface, semotic sense) who have printed so few copies of something that they are unable to spare a trade copy. At our table at AWP this year I was astounded at how many presses were afraid to trade their books due to only having ten copies printed.

  The total separation of the author and text suggested by Jerome McGann seems as relevant today as when certain poets upheld and reified this notion on others.  Otherwise we are back to a New Critical approach that is only able to "grade" a poem on the basis of a poets' life and its negative and/or meritable acts and the corrolation between. I hope our society as a whole has not become so retrograde as to adopt these types of policies in the microcosm of poetry for fear of that which will occur if we do not.


  By the way Brian, Tom Raworth said to say hello and that he plans to reprint your first post on his website, if there is problem, or you wish to speak to him, let me know backchannel and I will give his info.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  C.A.: Thanks for your reply. I only made the exchange public in hopes of getting thoughtful people to weigh in on the matter. I have a few notes to your message.

I do not accuse Silliman of being cold, but rather the opposite: that
he lets his personal animus against the man blind him to the rich
possibilities to the later poetry. I admit I may be wrong in my
deduction that Silliman singles out Dorn as contentious because Dorn
notoriously dismissed the notion that something called the language
school had changed and recharged the poetic landscape, but, despite
having read all of Dorn that I can find, and having talked with him a
few times, the notion that he was a nazi or an advocate of violent
solutions remains outside my experience and unattested in the reviews
in question. Silliman's view that Dorn was an implicit supporter of the
policies that led us into Iraq is based on an entirely unsupported
reading of one small poem. His notion that Dorn was a homophobe is, and
this is only my opinion, twisted.

Knopf does not put its reputation on the line by publishing Gluck, who
inhabits a tiny corner of that publishing empire. Those who published
Dorn, on the other hand, declared the importance of the work by doing
so, considering the necessity of a personal commitment. I do not say
that those publications prove his significance; I merely wondered why,
if Dorn's collapse is so obvious that both Silliman and Kleinzahler can
assure us that it is so without adducing significant evidence, so many
small publishers were willing to put their money, time, and reputations
into publishing it.=20

Where, in Silliman's piece, does he talk about "the things Dorn said
outside the poems"? The guy was no saint, and he may have said
intemperate things, and if those things can be used to amplify the
sense of the poems, I'm for that. But Silliman did not do so. The burden is
on those who think Dorn said terrible things to come forward with the
evidence.

You have come forward to--as you say--share, and your thoughts are
welcome. I do not think Silliman was sharing; I think his project was
closer to vilification. I think his reply to me, with its refusal to
confront my arguments, suggests that my supposition is not without
foundation.




Be well

I heartily second Barry Schwabsky's assessment of Ernesto Sabato, who also headed the Argentine Commission investigating the disappearances during the Dirty War of 1976 and onwards, and had a lot to do with the report, "Nunca Mas" (translated into English and now, of course given our amnesic times, out of print).  Sabato is still alive at 96, and in recent years has published a memoir, "Antes del fin / Before the End," an essay, "La Resistencia," and diaries of a journey to Spain a few years ago.

THE INPRINT PROJECT:
PERFORMANCE AS ACTIVISM

The inPrint Project brings together revolutionary
artists and activists pushing the boundaries of
traditional definitions of 'art' and 'community' and
exploring the potential of these intersections.
Nine artists present work in three evenings curated by
Chicago-based performance artist, Erica Mott.
http://www.ericamott.com/productions_inprint.html

8pm June 8-10
at Links Hall, 3435 N. Sheffield
Chicago, IL
http://www.linkshall.org

With performances by:
Anida Yoeu Ali
Rachel Damon
Clare Dolan
Elisa Foshay
Nicole Garneau
Jennifer Karmin
Erica Mott
Genevieve Erin O'Brien
Cristal Sabbagh

Tickets are $12 (general)
$10 (students/low income)
different program each night
see schedule below

SYMPOSIUM:
The inPrint Project also features a free symposium,
Contextualizing Art and Community, on Saturday, June
9, 2pm-5pm prior to that evening’s performances.
Participating artists will debate burning questions
like "How can we re-contextualize an artistic act as a
social act? How do we walk the line between
didacticism and aesthetics?" These burning questions
and more will be debated by provocateurs formerly
and presently from such organizations as Amnesty
International, Insight Arts, and Bread and Puppet.
The audience is encouraged to participate as artists
address traversing the sticky terrain where
art-making meets political activism.

PUBLICATION:
During the weekend of events, Growing Up Girl: An
Anthology of Voices from Marginalized Spaces will be
available for viewing and purchasing. Growing Up Girl
is an eclectic collection of poems, essays, and short
stories documents the transition from girl to woman as
told by the girls and women who know the journey best.
The multicultural anthology examines issues such as
identity, domestic violence, acceptance, motherhood,
beauty, and sexuality. Copies of the anthology will be
available thanks to Women & Children First, one of the
largest feminist bookstores in the country.

PERFORMANCE PROGRAM:
****Friday, June 8th****
Nicole Garneau and a crew of volunteers will create an
outdoor public action for peace and compassion at the
intersection of Newport, Sheffield, and Clark
entitled, 220 Weeks of War / Acts of Love. For this
work, she is inspired by the words of poet Sekou
Sundiata, who calls on artists and activists to
“uncover a ‘transcendent’ vision of society that lifts
our visions to the highest possibilities of human
conduct.”

inPrint incorporates live voice, projected image, and
movement to explore the disposability of the female
body—a dark tale examining what we as a society throw
away. Developed during a Dance Bridge Residency at the
Chicago Cultural Center, inPrint was conceived by
Chicago-based artist Erica Mott and includes movement
by Mott, Rachel Damon, and Elisa Foshay

****Saturday, June 9th****
Exploring women's reactions to pornography and female
pleasure, Jennifer Karmin will read her performative
text This Expert Slut Moans.  Part-poetry,
part-narrative, inner and outer, beautiful and ugly at
the same time.

In A Reading from the Interrogation Log of Detainee
063, Clare Dolan combines excerpts from the real
interrogation log of a detainee held by the United
States at "camp x-ray," with scenes of simple
puppetry, movement, and music.

inPrint (see description above)

****Sunday, June 10th****
Created by Anida Yoeu Ali and Cristal Sabbagh, Say
That! is a cathartic Butoh-inspired experiment in
which sexual stereotypes of women are embodied,
confronted, and ultimately subverted. Improvisational
movement and gesture also work in tandem with these
memories, myths and emotions.

The Monk Who Licked Me is a modern day odyssey into
the heart, mind, and body of a young woman on a
spiritual quest.  The story is a clever and poignant
exploration of transnational identity and the
effects of U.S. militarism from the U.S. war in
Vietnam to the SARS scare to the current day U.S. war
in Iraq .  Through a compelling and often hilarious
narrative, Erin O’Brien covers issues such as love,
sexual violence against women, and globalization by
interweaving her personal experiences and reactions
with the realities of the aftermath of war and U.S.
cultural imperialism.

inPrint (see description above)

ARTIST BIOS:
Anida Yoeu Ali is an interdisciplinary artist who
seeks an artistic, spiritual and political exploration
of her identity as a non hyphenated Cambodian Muslim
American woman.  She is interested in using
performance work as a means to transform loss into
conversations about healing and understanding.  She
aches for home, a good pair of ass-kicking shoes, and
poetry by Audre Lorde.
http://www.atomicshogun.com

Rachel Damon performs, creates, designs, and manages
performance. She currently works with Mad Shak Dance,
Dance Chicago, Greasy Joan and Co., Collaboraction,
Ravenswood Event Services, The NeoFuturists, and her
own company Synapse Arts Collective. Rachel is the
Technical Director of Links Hall, and is a member of
Lumen Siccum, the production and lighting company
under the direction of Margaret Nelson. Rachel also
knits like a crazy woman, loves action movies, and
eats dessert every day.
http://www.synapsearts.com.

Clare Dolan has been creating cantastoria
performances, toy theater shows, and life-sized puppet
plays since 1992. She leads workshops in
stilt-dancing, puppet building, pageant-making and
other things, while leading a secret double life as a
nursing student and counselor in a residential mental
health program. This production is a creation
of the Performance Department of The Museum Of
Everyday Life, a developing new museum, both
theoretical and actual, based in Glover , Vermont and
Ms. Dolan's brain.

Elisa Foshay spent much of her childhood in long
skirts, spinning in circles until the skirt was
billowing out and she got dizzy and fell down.  This
simple joy found in movement has carried her through
her time as a competitive ballroom dancer, her
undergrad at Columbia College Chicago to her current
life of teaching and performing dance.  Elisa loves to
investigate new ways of moving and continues to
do so by performing with various independent movement
artists.

Nicole Garneau is an interdisciplinary artist involved
in experimental theater, music, dance, visual art, and
writing. Her work is informed by feminism, struggle
against white supremacy, the politics of the female
body, sexuality, spirituality, her experiences living
and working in Russia , and the sociopolitical issues
of contemporary urban life. For 10 years, she has
worked closely with Insight Arts, an arts organization
dedicated to increasing access to cultural work that
promotes social justice and defends human rights. She
is interested in creating performance and visual art
work that is directly political, critically conscious,
and community building. She just completed HEAT:05, a
year of daily performances marking ten years since the
1995 Chicago heat wave disaster. She is a member of
the gender performance troupe, A Sordid Collective.
http://www.nicolegarneau.com

Jennifer Karmin is a poet, artist, and educator who
has experimented with language throughout the U.S. and
Japan . She curates the Red Rover Series with fiction
writer Amina Cain and is a founding member
of the public art group Anti Gravity Surprise.  Her
multidisciplinary projects have been presented at a
number of festivals, artist-run spaces, community
centers, and on city streets.  Jennifer teaches
creative writing to immigrants at Truman College and
works as a Poet-in-Residence for the Chicago Public
Schools.  Recent publications include Bird Dog, Milk
Magazine, The City Visible: Chicago Poetry for the New
Century, and Growing Up Girl: An Anthology of Voices
from Marginalized Spaces.

Erica Mott is a performer, director, and deviser whose
work is particularly inspired by observation of her
immediate environment. Through materials,
improvisation, butoh inspired movement and
site-specific performance, she attempts to capture and
heighten the magic, mystery and tragedy in everyday
activities and interactions. She endeavors to find
universality in these actions and her performance that
may be communicated across social, economic, and
cultural boundaries. Erica has performed locally with
Synapse Arts Collective, Storybox, Blair Thomas and
Company, Redmoon Theater and Local Infinities Visual
Theater. She was the artistic director of the MUKA
Project Theatre in Johannesburg , South Africa and the
founder/director of Collect4 in Exeter, England.

Genevieve Erin O'Brien is a Queer Vietnamese-Irish
American interdisciplinary artist, community
organizer, and popular educator.  As an
interdisciplinary artist her solo performance art has
engaged audiences up and down the West Coast from Los
Angeles to Vancouver B.C.  Called a "modern day
Virgil" by the LA Weekly, O'Brien's work
addresses hate crimes, homophobia, and violence
against women, with sensitivity and humor.
http://www.erinobrien.org

Cristal Sabbagh teaches art at Adlai E. Stevenson High
School .  She received her B.F.A. in Art Education
from the University of Illinois , in
Urbana/Champaign, and her M.A. in Interdisciplinary
Arts at Columbia College , Chicago .  She is a visual
artist as well as an interdisciplinary performance
artist.  Her work is motivated by film, culture,
history, death/rebirth, music, hip hop, yoga, and
butoh.  She has been studying butoh with Katsura Kan ,
Daisuke Yoshimoto, Diego Pinon and others.  Cristal
has performed work in Michigan, North Carolina, New
York and throughout Chicago.

* In a few weeks, Minor Americans and local heroes
kathryn l. pringle and Magadalena Zurawski are packing
up their MINERAL green Toyota Corolla and heading
south. Soon Durham, North Carolina will be all the
richer, and those of us holding down the fort in the
Bay Area will have to find them on their Minor
American blog.

Magdalena Zurawski adopted the title "Minor American
Poet" in the late 90s after coming across a reference
listing Frank O'Hara as a minor American poet. She
started a blog bearing that imprint in 2004, and in
2005, was joined by kathryn l. pringle.

kathryn l. pringle is a graduate of the MFA program at
SFSU. Her chapbook Temper and Felicity Are Lovers was
published by TAXT. Her work has appeared or is
forthcoming in Fourteen Hills, 42opus, Alice Blue,
Denver Quarterly, Dusie, Em Literary Asylum,
foursquare, sidebrow, small town, and others. She is
co-editor, along with Elise Ficarra & Magdalena
Zurawski, of the brand new print journal
minor/american.

Magdalena Zurawski's novel The Bruise was recently
awarded the Ronald Sukenick Innovative Fiction Prize,
sponsored by FC2. FC2 will publish the novel in the
fall of 2008.

'APHRODITE' - GALLERY OPENING - SAT JUNE 2, 2007

The Geoffrey Young Gallery is pleased to announce it's 16th season,
reopening on Saturday, June 2, 2007 with a three-person show called
APHRODITE.

    The moody Americana of KK Kozik's paintings (like single-image
novellas), will be joined by the stunning graphite and ink drawings of
Blaze Lamper's turbulent, wind-blown universe, and by the excruciating
sensibility of Ann Pibal's abstract paintings.

    These three women inhabit completely different, but not alien realms
within the art world. Their goddess of love is not an historical
remnant togged in marble drapery, but is bodied forth in the passion
and commitment with which they realize their particular creations.

There is a reception for the artists on Saturday, June 2, 5:30-7:30pm,
to which all are invited.

APHRODITE runs from June 2 - July 1.

Gallery hours: Friday-Sunday, 11-5pm.

I'm moving to Knoxville in late July. Can anyone put me in contact
with poets working there? Or tell me about some local venues?
Googling is only getting me slams, which are nice but not my cup of
poesy. I'm hoping for fellow-travelers there from the poetics list. JP

Without any snideness at all, I would like to point out that if we are
here referring to T.S. Eliot's poem,
the title is
The Waste Land.

Subject:      New ebooks from Shearsman
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Shearsman books http://www.shearsman.com/ has three new ebooks up on
its website, Ken Edwards, "Chaconne," Geoffrey Squires, "So," and
Rodney Nelson, "Swede Poems."  Very different work--Edwards does
tight riffs on music, Squires comnes as close to silence as words can
get, and Nelson makes a kind of history. All three are distinguished
by a spareness and poise unmarred by the slightest pretension. In
Geoff Squire's case "So" joins last year's ebook "Lines."  Both read
as a meditation at some very deep point in the mind where essential
connections are questioned.

Shearsman's website has to be one of the most generous on the web.
There are 18 ebooks so far, a few by folks known to this list--Steve
Vincent, Carlos Blackburn, and myself--and a bunch of others that
should be. Shearsman is one of the best sources for the important
poetry coming out of Britain, Ireland, and Australia, but also a
growing number of Americans: Nancy Kuhl, Tom Lowenstein, Deborah
Meadows, Toby Olson, Simon Perchik, Lisa Samuels,  Spencer Selby,
Gustaf Sobin, Nathaniel Tarn, Elizabeth Treadwell, and I probably missed a few.
And there are the translations, from French, Swedish, Spanish, Irish,
German, Portuguese and Anglo-Saxon.

A lot of great browsing. And then there are the backissues of
Shearsman magazine, an online gallery of e-chapbooks, and a large
recommendations section, with smart comments from Tony Fraser, the
wizard of all this, on an enormous range of English language, German
and Hispanic poetry.

One could easily spend several days here.

Jim,

It seems to me that what one feels about art matters almost solely to
oneself,
and has importance almost solely to oneself. What one thinks about art
shares
the same fate--until one expresses those thoughts, at which point their
importance does not depend on what (just) anyone thinks about art,
but about what influence one's thinking has on others who think about art.
How do you feel about this, and what do you think about it?

"It is precisely in its lack of care that the Sublime manifests itself as
such; indeed, any attempt at symbolization, description, language, can
only destroy its presence and perception. Perception? As if perception had
anything to do with fantasy! But this is a slow piece, as is stately for
those objects which have remained inviolate, only to be destitute in an
era of global warming. Still, yes, this work has to do with memory, memory
of rock and rock, of that green glacial runoff that carries the dream of a
universe within it. The sheer weight of a single boulder is enough of a
loss of bone and skeleton, nothing slowly raises to the sky but sky, or
but the world prior to landscape, beyond landscape. For landscape already
requires a vanishing point, not of the subject, but of the subject's gaze
which destroys it, so what of a landscape within and without which there
is nothing of the human, nothing but the momentary skittering of two of
them, signaling nowhere, nothing to say, unspeaking, unspeakable, in the

Dan,

I agree that writing some semblance of what one thinks and feels about art
changes things. Often it changes one's response to the art. And sometimes it
changes others, too, a bit.

Consider how we go about thinking and feeling about a work of art we enjoy
in light of a negative review from a critic of high standing whom we
respect. We will read his/her remarks carefully, perhaps, but we will not
simply roll over to the critic's point of view, even though s/he is famous
as a thinker and feeler about art and we ourselves are but as moths to the
light.

We will probably have reservations about the review--or the reviewer. Though
the review may also have changed how we think and feel about the art.
Indeed, it will have been an important event in the shaping of our response
to the art; if writing our own remarks is important, then reading those of
others is a bit less important but nonetheless influential. Usually. If we
aren't bored by the writing; sometimes we read reviews or remarks that
seemingly have little connection with our own experience, or to what we
enjoyed.

So, yes, I think you're right to point out that attempting to communicate
with others about the art is perhaps a fundamental act in creating an
externalized response to the art that can be collective. A kind of republic
of art.

Yet, even then, in the face of a republic of art, there is often tension
between the social and individual response. The individual is challenged to
deal productively with that tension or create his/her own productive
wilderness. Or both.

Imagine the problem is not physical. Imagine the problem has never been physical, that
it is not biodiversity, it is not the ozone layer, it is not the greenhouse effect, the
whales, the old-growth forest, the loss of jobs, the crack in the ghetto, the
methamphetamine in the suburbs, the abortions, the artworld acolytes, the stultified
institutions, the tongue in the mouth, the diseases stalking everywhere as love goes on
unconcerned. Imagine the problem is not some syndrome of our society that can be solved
by commissions or laws or a redistribution of what we call wealth. Imagine that it goes
deeper, right to the core of what we call our civilization and that no one outside of
ourselves can effect real change, that our civilization, our governments are sick and
that we are mentally ill and spiritually dead and that all our issues and crises are
symptoms of this deeper sickness. Imagine the problem is not physical and no amount of
relocation, no amount of rehabilitation will deal with the problem. Imagine that the
problem is not that we are powerless or that we are victims but that we have lost the
fire and belief and courage to act. We hear whispers of the future but we slap our hands
against our ears, we catch glimpses but turn our faces swiftly aside.

People who are afraid of rain puzzle me.  We're so much water we're so close
to drowning in the water, so what's the big deal with a little splashing on
us on the outside, right?

BUY AN UMBRELLA, and BOOTS, KICK the water AROUND, HAVE FUN, and most of all
relax, please, relax.  It's just rain.  It's going to rain again one day,

Jim and Dan,

it seems if you feel strongly enough in your responses, then you write about
it; you try to create your own narrative of response, to which others may
respond or not. That is to say, a Darwininian, survival of the fitter (to
what, the needs of others?) takes place in the realm of ideas, including
about art. What it starts with is the strength of the original passion, or
need, which makes one enunciate, put in writing that disagreement. In other
words, new ideas start with facing down the fear of being disagreed with.

Ciao.

Thanks for clearing that up. Perhaps then the following will explain
why I have such bad grammar:

Case No. 7Sm004086
Cite No. P102291
Violoation Date 01/22/07

RE: Under Submission Finding

In the above-mentioned case taken under submission, the Court makes
afinding of Guilty. Judgment is as follows:

You have been ordered to pay a fine in the sum of 319.00 The cash
bail on deposit has been applied to full payment of fine and the
balance, if applicable, shall be refunded to the depositor within 45
days.

They go on to list separate fines for all the dangling modifiers I
have on file. Of course, I never pay them.

They also sent a notice asking me to forward it to Mr. Geore
Bowering. You owe US$20 for the following sentence (taken off your
website): "Not to the poet, but to the poem."
Finding: insufficient subject.

Defendant

(related to the David Antin walkabout query):

isn't there an extended discussion in Kenner somewhere of PERIPLUM in Pound?

I'm trying to point someone to it, and after thumbing around both big Kenner
Pound books I can't find much. odd.

or is there a long discussion maybe in ABC of Reading?

anyway whenever I teach chunks of The Cantos I talk about periploi, but now
can't find where I learned about them (oddly like: Pound saying there were
30 good pages in all of Whitman, but when he went to locate them he couldn't
find them).

thanks,

<http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/news/press/2007/fobfile.html>


AUSTIN, TexasThe University of Texas at Austin's Harry Ransom Humanities
Research Center and the Reading University Library have created Firms Out
of Business (FOB), an online database containing the names and addresses
of copyright holders or contact persons for out-of-business printing and
publishing firms, magazines, literary agencies and similar organizations
that have archives housed in libraries and archives in North America and
the United Kingdom.

FOB can be accessed at

<http://www.fob-file.com>

FOB is a companion project to the Writers, Artists and Their Copyright
Holders (WATCH), an online database containing the names and addresses of
copyright holders or contact persons for authors and artists. The WATCH
file is accessible at

<http://www.watch-file.com>


The objective of both projects is to provide information to scholars and
researchers about whom to contact for permission to publish text and
images that have copyright protection.

"The long-standing partnership between the Ransom Center and the
University of Reading has already produced the WATCH Web site, which has
become a worldwide standard reference tool," said co-creator David Sutton,
of the University of Reading in Whiteknights, United Kingdom.

<snip>

"It has always been particularly difficult for writers, editors and
publishers to locate the rights holders for little magazines and book
publishers that have vanished, leaving behind so-called orphaned works,"
said Ransom Center Librarian Richard Workman. "FOB will be a means of
identifying the rightful copyright owners of these works, thus allowing
them to be republished or adapted."

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ascii

A poet friend and I were recently discussing the use of outside sources in our poems, and we came up with a question we couldn't answer. When you extract text directly from research to use as lines in the poem, how should you cite the source? For example, she has written a wonderful poem including a lot of information on an animal, but she got the information from mainly Internet sources, such as online encyclopedias. Much of it contains direct quotations, but much of it is also paraphrased; it is more than just an epigram, because it frames the rest of the poem, and is interspersed throughout the poem. How would you handle this without turning a poem into a research paper?

Why I like theatre. Not only the work, but that its temporal and
collaborative nature and its immediacy invite conversation - eg the
responses to responses to Helene Cixous's The Perjured City.

The scholar exists in a realm where there are concerns of plagarism.  The artist exists in a realm where there are concerns of allusion.  Pete Seger's father (or was it his grandfather who was the folklorist in the family) made the point that all cultural is predicated on the presumption of "plagarism" in the strictest sense.  The author of Ecclesiastes quite rightly asserted that there is nothing new new under the sun.  The great songs of the various minstrels in the Odyssey are cribbed from stories in general circulation (a point which the text points out).

Language is inherently referential just as culture builds upon a foundation of common understanding and/or expression.  (Even to attempt to make a conscious decision to deny this is, in effect, an affirmation of the essential truth of this as an underlying assumption).  Therefore, we cannot avoid making implicit or overt references to other forms of verbal expression.

I was recently attempting to find the source of the quote "In dreams begin responsibility."  Most sources point to Yeats or Delmore Schwartz (via Yeats) and leave it at that.  But Yeats used the phrase as an epigram to his collection "Responsibilities" and cited it as coming from an "Old Play."  Think about the legs that quote has had. (It applies to the topic of my response as well.) It is routinely attributed to Yeats but he claimed the source to be an unnamed "Old Play."  Scholars attribute it to Yeats but Yeats himself blamed someone else.

So to morph a bit -- As long as we are responsible with our dreams ....  As long as we build upon the material or shape it ....  As long as we use it rather than merely passing it off ....

I think the point is that we should not intentionally deceive, we should assume (or at least hope for) general knowledge, and we should trust readers to be aware of the social/reader's contract with the author that reading is an act understanding and verification; that both reader and author are questing to build a common ground in a universe in which even previously stated "truths" have variable meanings in various contexts.

I'm am sorry to go on at such length here, but I feel that current U.S. concepts of "plagarism" have become intensely stupid, materialistic, narrow minded, and ignorant of tradition (particualrly non-western perspectives).  All culture builds and feeds upon itself.

Artists are not scholars (in one of the narrow senses) we adhere (somewhat like Hebrew National hot dogs) to a higher authority, our own.

Since no one's sprinting to our defense, I hope I can be forgiven for
offering a brief response to David Baratier's comments on recent
issues of Chicago Review. (Though I write as a co-editor of the
magazine, I don't presume to speak for my fellow editors and staff
members. The magazine is too small, too precariously assembled to
tolerate a party line.)

I'd like to leave Mr. Baratier's concerns about the Dorn issue to the
side, since I wasn't at the magazine then and can't speak for Eirik,
except to say his deep knowledge of and serious passion for Dorn's
work hardly qualifies him as a "dabbler." And I can't speak to whether
our "entire tone has went to silence" or the poetry we publish
"promotes inaction." It's true that we haven't had any fan letters
from the barricades, but I'm not sure that settles the case. For most
people on this planet, the fact that we pay as much attention to
poetry as we do would count as evidence for charge that we're "out of
step with the needs of the current age."

What irked me, prompting this response, is that we've just come off a
string of issues that tried to confront exactly the question of "why
[and how] poetry can matter especially in the political realm." The
question of the relation of literature and politics (and it is a
question, with no simple untroubling answer) was and is a central one
for the writers we've featured in recent issues: people like CD
Wright, Lisa Robertson, Kenneth Rexroth, Wu Ming, Andrea Brady, and
Keston Sutherland.

Poetry isn't going to make gas any cheaper, nor is it going to deprive
the Bush family of their annual income. It probably won't stop the
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan either. But this isn't to say that I
doubt literature's possible relevance to politics. The tough
questions, as always, are how and where and when that possibility can
become actual. CR's not going to publish agitprop, but we do publish,
and will continue to publish, writers who give those questions serious
thought and attention.

Whether or not that qualifies us as sufficiently engag=E9e is not a
question that particularly troubles me. As an editor, my conscience is
clear. What does particularly trouble me, as a human being and as a
citizen, is the havoc this government continues to deploy in my and my
compatriots' names and the degree to which I am complicit in that
havoc. On that score, my conscience is deeply, and I hope permanently,
troubled.

Subject:      Raster, symmetries, and request for help
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Raster


I graph various forms of the equation y = tan(x^2); interesting phenomena
appear. Check out the .gif images at http://www.asondheim.org/ - the names
are equation00.gif, equation01.gif, etc. The graphs extend along the
x-axis with what appear to be constantly changing local symmetries. I have
experimented with different software/hardware, beginning with a TI-85
graphing calculator and a highly precision similar software program,
GraphCalc (obtained from Sourceforge). I've also used the graphing calcu-
lator and Mathematica in Mac OS9. Only in the last, Mathematica, did the
symmetries seem to disappear. I think the phenomena - the perception of
local symmetries - is the result of raster, i.e. the digitalization pro-
cess in the calculation of what are basically analogic functions. Raster
is tolerance-dependent; it's the digital 'jump' screened against the real.
The symmetries appear to be, masquerade as, independent 'things,' dif-
ferent from one another, lined up and sometimes intersecting in a chaotic
fashion. In other words, the appearance of things is constituted here by
the very absence of things; within the digital raster, every point, pixel,
is independent, disconnected, from every other.

Ah well, it's late and I'm not expressing myself well. I'll try again:
Given y = tan(x^2), the resulting graph on a digital computer seems to be
raster-dependent; the image appears to possess local and intersecting
symmetrical segments which seem chaotic. These segments can be considered
'things' in the sense of perceptually-defined contour-mapping. (In other
words, they appear to be things, local processes, local phenomena, whether
or not they are in 'actuality,' within the real.) Using a bad metaphor,
such 'things' are clearly gestalt images of disconnected pixels - i.e. a
line in the graph which appears connected, isn't. When sections of the
graph are enlarged, their morphology may radically transform. So what I'm
interested in is the digital representation of this particular group of
analogic functions, and the mathematics behind it. Is the representation
really chaotic? Are the symmetries really geometrically different from one
another, and if so, what's the mathematics behind this? And so forth. Any
help you might give me s greatly appreciated. In the meantime, the images
are beautiful. Check out the gifs and jpegs at http://www.asondheim.org/ -
look at the 'equation' files.

Ray Bradbury: Fahrenheit 451 Misinterpreted

L.A.=92s august Pulitzer honoree says it was never about censorship
By AMY E. BOYLE JOHNSTON
Wednesday, May 30, 2007 - 7:00 pm

http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/ray-bradbury-fahrenheit-451-=20
misinterpreted/16524/

When the Pulitzer Prizes were handed out in May during a luncheon at =20
Columbia University, two special citations were given. One went to =20
John Coltrane (who died in 1967), the fourth time a jazz musician has =20=

been honored. The other went to Ray Bradbury, the first time a writer =20=

of science fiction and fantasy has been honored.

Bradbury, a longtime Los Angeles resident who leads an active civic =20
life and even drops the Los Angeles Times letters to the editor on =20
his views of what ails his town, did not attend, telling the Pulitzer =20=

board his doctor did not want him to travel.

But the real reason, he told the L.A. Weekly, had less to do with the =20=

infirmities of age (he turns 87 in August) than with the fact that =20
recipients only shake hands with Lee C. Bollinger, Columbia =20
University=92s president, and smile for a photograph.

He wanted to give a speech, but no remarks are allowed. =93Not even a =20=

paragraph,=94 he says with disdain.

In his pastel-yellow house in upscale Cheviot Hills, where he has =20
lived for more than 50 years, Bradbury greeted me in his sitting =20
room. He wore his now-standard outfit of a blue dress shirt with a =20
white collar and a jack-o=92-lantern tie (Halloween is his favorite =20
day) and white socks. This ensemble is in keeping with Bradbury=92s =20
arrested development. George Clayton Johnson, who gave us Logan=92s =20
Run, says, =93Ray has always been 14 going on 15.=94

Bradbury still has a lot to say, especially about how people do not =20
understand his most literary work, Fahrenheit 451, published in 1953. =20=

It is widely taught in junior high and high schools and is for many =20
students the first time they learn the names Aristotle, Dickens and =20
Tolstoy.

Now, Bradbury has decided to make news about the writing of his =20
iconographic work and what he really meant. Fahrenheit 451 is not, he =20=

says firmly, a story about government censorship. Nor was it a =20
response to Senator Joseph McCarthy, whose investigations had already =20=

instilled fear and stifled the creativity of thousands.

This, despite the fact that reviews, critiques and essays over the =20
decades say that is precisely what it is all about. Even Bradbury=92s =20=

authorized biographer, Sam Weller, in The Bradbury Chronicles, refers =20=

to Fahrenheit 451 as a book about censorship.

Bradbury, a man living in the creative and industrial center of =20
reality TV and one-hour dramas, says it is, in fact, a story about =20
how television destroys interest in reading literature.

=93Television gives you the dates of Napoleon, but not who he was,=94 =20=

Bradbury says, summarizing TV=92s content with a single word that he =20
spits out as an epithet: =93factoids.=94 He says this while sitting in a =
=20
room dominated by a gigantic flat-panel television broadcasting the =20
Fox News Channel, muted, factoids crawling across the bottom of the =20
screen.

His fear in 1953 that television would kill books has, he says, been =20
partially confirmed by television=92s effect on substance in the news. =20=

The front page of that day=92s L.A. Times reported on the weekend box-=20=

office receipts for the third in the Spider-Man series of movies, =20
seeming to prove his point.

=93Useless,=94 Bradbury says. =93They stuff you with so much useless =20
information, you feel full.=94 He bristles when others tell him what =20
his stories mean, and once walked out of a class at UCLA where =20
students insisted his book was about government censorship. He=92s now =20=

bucking the widespread conventional wisdom with a video clip on his =20
Web site (http://www.raybradbury.com/at_home_clips.html), titled =20
=93Bradbury on censorship/television.=94

As early as 1951, Bradbury presaged his fears about TV, in a letter =20
about the dangers of radio, written to fantasy and science-fiction =20
writer Richard Matheson. Bradbury wrote that =93Radio has contributed =20=

to our =91growing lack of attention.=92... This sort of hopscotching =20
existence makes it almost impossible for people, myself included, to =20
sit down and get into a novel again. We have become a short story =20
reading people, or, worse than that, a QUICK reading people.=94


He says the culprit in Fahrenheit 451 is not the state =97 it is the =20
people. Unlike Orwell=92s 1984, in which the government uses television =20=

screens to indoctrinate citizens, Bradbury envisioned television as =20
an opiate. In the book, Bradbury refers to televisions as =93walls=94 =
and =20
its actors as =93family,=94 a truth evident to anyone who has heard a =20=

recap of network shows in which a fan refers to the characters by =20
first name, as if they were relatives or friends.

The book=92s story centers on Guy Montag, a California fireman who =20
begins to question why he burns books for a living. Montag eventually =20=

rejects his authoritarian culture to join a community of individuals =20
who memorize entire books so they will endure until society once =20
again is willing to read.

Bradbury imagined a democratic society whose diverse population turns =20=

against books: Whites reject Uncle Tom=92s Cabin and blacks disapprove =20=

of Little Black Sambo. He imagined not just political correctness, =20
but a society so diverse that all groups were =93minorities.=94 He wrote =
=20
that at first they condensed the books, stripping out more and more =20
offending passages until ultimately all that remained were footnotes, =20=

which hardly anyone read. Only after people stopped reading did the =20
state employ firemen to burn books.

Most Americans did not have televisions when Bradbury wrote =20
Fahrenheit 451, and those who did watched 7-inch screens in black and =20=

white. Interestingly, his book imagined a future of giant color sets =20
=97 flat panels that hung on walls like moving paintings. And =20
television was used to broadcast meaningless drivel to divert =20
attention, and thought, away from an impending war.

Bradbury=92s latest revelations might not sit well in L.A.=92s =
television =20
industry, where Scott Kaufer, a longtime television writer and =20
producer, argues, =93Television is good for books and has gotten more =20=

people to read them simply by promoting them,=94 via shows like This =20
Week and Nightline.

Kaufer says he hopes Bradbury =93will be good enough in hindsight to =20
see that instead of killing off literature, [TV] has given it an =20
entire boost.=94 He points to the success of fantasy author Stephen =20
King in television and film, noting that when Bradbury wrote =20
Fahrenheit 451, another unfounded fear was also taking hold =97 that =20
television would destroy the film industry.

And in fact, Bradbury became famous because his stories were =20
translated for television, beginning in 1951 for the show Out There. =20
Eventually he had his own program, The Ray Bradbury Theater, on HBO.


Bradbury spends most of his time now in a small space on the second =20
floor of his home that contains books and mementos. There is his Emmy =20=

from The Halloween Tree, an Oscar that belonged to a friend who died, =20=

a sculpture of a dinosaur and various Halloween decorations. =20
Bradbury, before a stroke left him in a wheelchair, typed in the =20
basement, which is filled with stuffed animals, toys, fireman hats =20
and bottles of dandelion wine. He referred to these props as =20
=93metaphors,=94 totems he drew on to spark his imagination and drive =20=

away the demons of the blank page.

Beginning in Arizona when his parents bought him a toy typewriter, =20
Bradbury has written a short story a week since the 1930s. Now he =20
dictates his tales over the phone, each weekday between 9 a.m. and =20
noon, to his daughter Alexandria.

Bradbury has always been a fan, and advocate, of popular culture =20
despite his criticisms of it. Yet he harbors a distrust of =20
=93intellectuals.=94 Without defining the term, he says another reason =20=

why he rarely leaves L.A. to travel to New York is =93their =20
intellectuals.=94

Dana Gioia, a poet who is chairman of the National Endowment for the =20
Arts, and who wrote a letter in support of granting Bradbury a =20
Pulitzer honor, compared him to J.D. Salinger, Jack London and Edgar =20
Allan Poe. Another supporter wrote that Bradbury=92s works =93have =
become =20
the sort of classics that kids read for fun and adults reread for =20
their wisdom and artistry.=94

In June, Gauntlet Press will release Match to Flame, a collection of =20
20 short stories by Bradbury that led up to Fahrenheit 451. Pointing =20
to his unpublished proofreading version of the upcoming collection, =20
Bradbury says that rereading his stories made him cry. =93It=92s hard to =
=20
believe I wrote such stories when I was younger,=94 he says.

His book still stands as a classic. But one of L.A.=92s best-known =20
residents wants it understood that when he wrote it he was far more =20
concerned with the dulling effects of TV on people than he was on the =20=

silencing effect of a heavy-handed government. While television has =20
in fact superseded reading for some, at least we can be grateful that =20=

firemen still put out fires instead of start them.=

*New American Writing
http://www.newamericanwriting.com/
Founded in 1986, New American Writing is a literary magazine emphasizing
contemporary American poetry. Edited by Paul Hoover, poet and editor of
Postmodern American Poetry (W. W. Norton , 1994), and Maxine Chernoff, poet
and author of the works of fiction Bop and American Heaven, it appears once
a year in early June. The magazine is distinctive for publishing a range of
innovative contemporary writing. Each issue includes cover art by leading
artists, including Alex Katz, Robert Mapplethorpe, Jennifer Bartlett,
Elizabeth Murray, and Fairfield Porter. Contributors have included John
Ashbery, Robert Creeley, Charles Simic, Jorie Graham, Denise Levertov, Hild=
a
Morley, August Kleinzahler, Ann Lauterbach, Ned Rorem, Wanda Coleman,
Nathaniel Mackey, Barbara Guest, Marjorie Perloff, Lyn Hejinian, and Charle=
s
Bernstein, among others. Contributors have frequently been included in the
annual anthology, The Best American Poetry (Scribners), edited by poet and
critic David Lehman and a distinguished guest editor. Work from the magazin=
e
has also appeared in the distinguished Pushcart Anthology. In l988 the
magazine was named one of the nation's 10 outstanding literary magazines by
the Coordinating Council of Literary Magazines. Special issues of the
magazine include a supplement of Australian poetry edited by John Tranter
(No. 4), an issue on Censorship and the Arts (No. 5), a supplement of
innovative poetry from Great Britain edited by Ric Caddel, and a supplement
of Brazilian poetry edited by R=E9gis Bonvicino (No. 18).

Good posts on this. I'm all for end notes, or footnotes myself--though
what doesn't come off the internet these days, really? One thing that the
recent focus on found texts points out is the degree to which all text is
in some way, found text...it's how you handle it.

A possible answer to this problem might be, unless it comes from someone else's poem, to just include the material without bothering to put it in quotations or to footnote it.  After all, regardless of where it came from, it has never been in a poem before.  Everything comes from somewhere.  It seems like a simple solution.  No use going crazy over some rigid notion of quotational ethics that no one adheres to anyway.  Regards, Tom Savage

it was LA's "one city one book" book the only time they tried that and
since I taught it in my ca lit class & my film and lit class, I was
supposed to lead a discussion at a local coffee shop and be on tv

well, no one showed up

I always thought was a lot about tv, but those portions were so durned
misogynistic as well, that teaching, I tended to emphasize other
aspects; and of course I taught it because... it has been made into a
movie a few times, with varying results... and they were showing the
films on tv and had them in all the local video stores to rent, so I
knew that there was no excuse for the students not to read the book
and see the movie

Personally, if it's from a poet or well known figure I try to put in the
name in parenthesis after the quote when that works with the line or =
becomes
rightly part of the poem. I also try to italicize it. And I'm not =
adverse to
using endnotes. But sometimes all of these methods seem to sit adversely =
in
the poem. Then I just use it the quote (always will to mention where it =
came
from). Some people might call that stealing, but that's not how it seems =
to
be to me. I try all of the above at least quickly before I use it =
without
attribution. What the poem needs (as it seems to me) seems to be the =
only
worthwhile standard, at least to me.

Some lines (i.e., "Death is the mother of beauty") need no attribution =
for
many people and the above doesn't apply to them, at least not in the =
same
way.=20

Two things to think about, whatever the source:

1. is the fact of the borrowing a part of the poet's intent? In which
case clearly it should be cited, or it remains a private joke.

2. is the material owned by an entity that's likely to ask for
permission for the citation and perhaps $$ for use, or on the other
hand throw scary lawyers at you if you don't ask permission. That's
what acknowledgements are for.

On the latter, we most of us most of the time take the odds that the
poem will remain obscure. After you've won the Nobel Prize you may
regret the poem beginning "when you wish upon a star."

When John Ashbery began a poem with the words, "We hold these truths to be self-evident," he did not need to cite his source nor was it a private joke. Many quotations seem so "self-evident," it would be pedantic to point them out. On the other hand, a non-US reader might not recognize Ashbery's citation. There is a irresolvable conflict between the temptation to write to those who know what you know (which might be, in fact, only you) and the desire to write to everyone, possibly all sentient beings that might exist now and in the future (which is impossible). The negotiation of this conflict can be called style.

contemporary academic practice, there's a tendency to over-endnote

contemporary = happening now

postmodernism = an art history term referring to art made "after"
modernism from approximately the end of world war 2 to the resignation
of Richard Nixon

In general, I'm in favor of either "not at all" or "obsessively"
noting sources, but I have this manuscript that I've really struggled
with the notes for, because I feel knowing the sources adds a
dimension to the work, and the work is perhaps less obviously built
from sources than someone who isn't in "the Industry" and also a
reader of LA writing

I like what Rachel Loden did in her book... "after" Richard Nixon... I
think she was asked to make notes by her press?  Is she still on list?
 And so, then basically worked the notes from memory.  If I remember
correctly.

Subject:      grousing about citation
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

I think there's something deeply wrong with a poem that, in the reasonable
interests of fairness or credit, needs to somehow mark a citation (except
when it occurs as an epigram, I suppose that's as fair game as indenting
for a linebreak within a metrical unit.)

There's something wrong I think with a poetic practice that requires one
make typographical decisions to properly notate the "pose" of quotation.
I'm not adverse to italics to denote a stance along the lines of "I am
speaking in the voice of another" -- this is something deeply connected to
notions of poetry-as-oral-performance, with ritualized and finite gestures
-- but when you have a poem that requires that stance go beyond an
atomistic gesture, I think there's been a malfunction.

I think this practice, in general, of creeping citationism (nice
Spoonerism: seeking creationism) is a symptom of the final stages of a
certain notion of poetry that is thankfully dissipating: the idea of
poetry as some kind of gloss on ideas from the academy, a kind of
"singing along to the tune". Cantor to the Cantos.

There's an even worse process, I think, which is when poets start writing
"to" each other as if they're exchanges in a peer reviewed journal. I
don't mean to close off any of the infinite avenues for poetry to travel
down, but really, the exchange of ideas in academic journals has got to be
one of the thinnest gruels we've tried to live on in a long time.

All this should definitely be appended with the note that I'm not
attacking the work of anybody on this thread (when I do attack work, I use
names!) I suppose what I'm saying to whoever first posted the request, and
whoever gave suggestions is that I promise you're a better poet than that.

Be brave, steal, if your poem is any good your readers won't care.
There's another sad reason for people's drive to cite, of course, which is
the problem that we reward poets not for poetry, but for "being poets" by
occupying a seat in the English department. For completely valid reasons
we expect our professors to be creative, indepedent beings, but what this
has to do with the communal practice of poetry I don't know.

It does drive people to cite contemporaries and near-misses because how
awful would it be to get tenure on an excellent poem collaged from others?
You might get hauled up in front of a plagiarism committee (having served
on the jury of such a thing, it's not fun for anyone.)

Anyway, put the conditions of the above two paragraphs down to yet another
maleficent influence of Enlightenment scholarship on the Rhapsode.

Because of the onerous two-message limit, I can't really elaborate or
respond (I find conversations rapidly move out from under me in these
situations where you have to wait a day.) I'm dealing with this question
in an essay coming out soon in absent, and I'm happy to chat backchannel.

First of all, thanks for the patience of all our contributors to absent
issue two. Elisa and I, and our angel Irwin Chen, are so terribly,
terribly close to coming out and are now just wrestling with horrific
cross-platform browser issues. All should look out for the issue in the
near future -- we have fantastic poetry, translations and prose in the
works.

Secondly, two new reviews on rhubarb is susan, of Sarah Hannah (in
versedaily) and of Ron Silliman (in milk, meaning the work appeared in
milk magazine, not that it was written by Ron while sitting in a churn.)

There are also some personal updates from me at

And the full archive of reviews, now numbering over one hundred of fifty,
spanning a large fraction of the best journals on and offline, and going

No, not grammar, but the way of looking how language works.
Perhaps this is what's been misleading here, since when you take
a look at something like this for the first time you can have some
misconceptions about what they are about and what they can offer.
I don't believe anyone is talking about some kind of authority on
what is correct and what is incorrect in a given language (even the
language of this poetics list). But in looking at the way of language;
we could treat language and the ways people use it as phenomena
to be looksee'd much as a paleobotanist treats what grew/grows.
I think we are talking here of wanting to figure out how what we
say works to make us work (or not). I don't think we're any more
in the biz of making value judgments about the way we say what
we say than any "scientists" are in the business of making value
judgments about the cooling of the earth's core.

Thanks for the H stuff for bp.
Note: you could check out which of the alphabet sections of Winnipeg
that beep lived inn as a kid.
Also, did you notice that if you draw horizontal lines on top
and bottom, H becomes 8?
H is the 8th letter in the alphabet.

That is very neat. If you get an old enough Houston Astros hat, you get
an H inside a star. Wow.

If you check out the cover of bp's As Elected: Selected Writing,
Talonbooks,
1980, you'll see a nice photo of two tall trees with that part of the H
(what
IS its name?) that is horizontal. The photo was taken by Kim Ondaatje in

The Declaration of Independence is public domain.

As I understand the law, there's a line limit for fair use of poetry

I run collagepoetry.com and its email group. Everybody on that list uses
collage method cut and paste for poetic construction. Some attribute

the reader to be aware of your sources. In the case of my own collage =
poetry
you can put just about any line of my work in google and find the source =
but
I don't attribute any of it to anybody because just about everything =
anyone
says is phrased in a common use of the language and very little can be

But sometimes the citation is integral to the piece

"Even the least story begins nowhere, in the webbing of

and Spicer's radio. Deep space. "The primitive does not
exist" (Todorov). Before beyond. What's beneath

That's an obvious example, where "(Todorov)" seems essential to the line
(and poem)as well as establishing the quote as that of someone else with =
a

in
certain ways, whatever. I would suggest that there are many more, less
obvious, uses of citation whether inter-textual or in endnotes, etc. =
Some of
these may seem difficult to justify with logic, but seem artistically
necessarily. At least to my "ear."

I think there's something deeply wrong with a poem that, in the =

interests of fairness or credit, needs to somehow mark a citation =
(except=20
when it occurs as an epigram, I suppose that's as fair game as indenting =

for a linebreak within a metrical unit.)

There's something wrong I think with a poetic practice that requires one =

I'm not adverse to italics to denote a stance along the lines of "I am=20

atomistic gesture, I think there's been a malfunction.

I think this practice, in general, of creeping citationism (nice=20

don't mean to close off any of the infinite avenues for poetry to travel =

down, but really, the exchange of ideas in academic journals has got to =

one of the thinnest gruels we've tried to live on in a long time.

All this should definitely be appended with the note that I'm not=20

whoever gave suggestions is that I promise you're a better poet than =
that.

Be brave, steal, if your poem is any good your readers won't care.=20

Just when we were getting back to using our backyard laundry line, enjoying

through with this 'virtual' pathos, as unreal as it is real, re-defining
what hangs on another kind of 'line' in such a sadly, disturbing way:

This is somehow like discovering the missing child's clothes and shoes next

Baratier, I just wanted to say that your gripe against CHICAGO REVIEW has
puzzled me.  When I think about all the literary journals it feels like 95
percent of them would never consider featuring Zukofsky or Dorn for an
entire issue.

I'm not much of a Dorn fan but like I said before, that piece by Dale Smith
in the CHICAGO REVIEW made me rethink Dorn, and also made me wish I liked
Dorn's poems more.

'Laundry letters' worth millions
POSTED: 10:31 a.m. EDT, June 4, 2007

http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/06/04/britain.letters.reut/
index.html

LONDON, England (Reuters) -- One of the word's greatest collections
of historical letters, including a note written by Napoleon to his
lover Josephine, has been found in a filing cabinet tucked away in a
Swiss laundry room.

The treasure trove of almost 1,000 documents, collected over 30 years
by a wealthy Austrian banker, includes letters written by Winston
Churchill, Peter the Great, Mahatma Gandhi, Alexander Pushkin, John
Donne and Queen Elizabeth I.

One of the rarest and most touching of the collection is a passionate
letter written by an apologetic Napoleon to his wife to be,
Josephine, the morning after a furious argument.

"I send you three kisses -- one on your heart, one on your mouth and
one on your eyes," wrote the chastened lover in a spidery scrawl full
of corrections and crossings out.

The letters, which cover more than 500 years and range across art,
science, literature and philosophy, are to be auctioned by Christie's
in London on July 3 and are expected to raise up to 2.3 million
pounds ($4.6 million).

"It really is an incredibly dense, very carefully researched
collection," Thomas Venning, director in Christie's books department
and a specialist in signed letters, told Reuters.

"To get a collection of letters like this nowadays is really a one-
off, it's almost unheard of."

The owner, Albin Schram, began amassing the archive in the early
1970s, steadily building up one of the largest and most comprehensive
collections outside a major museum.

Though an inveterate collector, Schram wasn't interested in
conservation or display -- the letters were kept in an old metal
cabinet in the laundry room of his villa in Lausanne, Switzerland,
ordered by size rather than author or date.

When he died in 2005, his family barely knew they were there.

Schram's interests spanned Russian poets, Argentine authors, French
philosophers, English politicians and Italian sculptors.

One of the most prized lots, with an auction estimate of up to
120,000 pounds, is a note written by metaphysical poet John Donne to
Lady Kingsmill a day after the death of her husband in October 1624.

Urging her not to presume to contest God's actions, Donne, who was
dean of St Paul's Cathedral at the time, adds: "although we could
direct him to do them better."

"It's an incredibly moving letter to read," said Venning.

"This is one of Britain's greatest poets, a contemporary of
Shakespeare, writing at a very emotional time... Not only that, but
it's exceptionally rare -- there is perhaps only one other John Donne
letter in private hands."

Another lot of interest is a letter written by Ernest Hemingway to
the American poet and critic Ezra Pound in 1925, explaining why bulls
are better than literary critics.

"Bulls don't run reviews. Bulls of 25 don't marry old women of 55 and
expect to be invited to dinner. Bulls do not get you cited as co-
respondent in Society divorce trials. Bulls don't borrow money. Bulls
are edible after they have been killed."

Andrew Keen, a former Silicon Valley entrepreneur, has set the blogosphere alight with his new book, a scathing attack on user-generated content. Sub-titled “How the Internet is killing our culture”, Keen’s book is a polemic against the “anything goes” standards of much of online publishing.
Keen does not believe in “the wisdom of the crowd”. Much of the content filling up YouTube, MySpace, and blogs is just an “an endless digital forest of mediocrity” which, unconstrained by professional standards or editorial filters, can alter public debate and manipulate public opinion
He also fears that the free swapping, downloading, mashing-up and aggregating of intellectual property threaten the ability of artists and thinkers with contributions of real value to earn a livelihood from their talents.
‘The Cult of the Amateur’ is published by Random House on June 5. Andrew Keen will be online to answer questions about his book on Thursday June 7 at 2pm BST (9am EDT).

  Scott Malby on apocryphaltext:

  “Steven Teref writes in a poem featured in this impressive little journal: "The tunnel is subject to what the eyes fill it with." This quote can also be applied to electronic literary publishing in a number of fascinating ways. In APOCRYPHAL TEXT the literate mixes with garage band and appears to create not only a new vocabulary, but a new language and landscape. Editor Alan May is unerring in his textual choice of print and spacing. He states on his submissions page, "APOCRYPHAL TEXT seeks to publish poets with distinct voices/visions. The idiosyncratic and downright ornery are welcome." This strange little poetry site may well provide a remarkable and perverse glimpse into tomorrow. It is thoroughly embedded in the surreal possibilities and dangers inherent in contemporary literary internet publishing, and yet, as a result of, or because of it, provides a minimal, apocalyptic, starkly appealing vision.”

There is as much mediocre art at the university as there is out "in the streets" (or on the internet). I don't have a proof of that except from personal observation. It seems that in academia art is often predictable and conservative. It is not until after the fact that academia examines that art. I think that it is important to know where your art is coming from. Does the artist have a perspective on the tools and form of expression? Has the artist viewed or read art to get a sense of its history, how it fits into the culture, etc. Some of the most exciting art (including writing) has been created outside of academia. It is simply harder to live and create without academic support, but then it is also hard to live and create within academia. I see all the poetry that is being written now, and I know that little of it will survive the years, including my own. I guess I don't write for that reason. Why the hell do we create anyway? I ask myself that all the time, but I
 continue writing my "mediocre" poetry nonetheless. It is important to me, as I am sure that bloggs are important to the bloggers, as are all forms of creative expression.

I need to add that whenever I go into a bookstore like B&N (the only bookstore in the town that I live in), I am amazed at all the books that should never have been published. Never.

rounding out the Minnesota contingent here: my latest run-ins have been
with friends, colleagues -- even my wife -- who keep banging the "but is
it Great Art?" drum.=20

I doubt they know what they mean by "Great Art" -- to my ears it's as
tinny and false a phrase as "the Great American Novel," and I tend to
think that people who throw such expressions around are the least
capable of recognizing work that's worth investing time in.=20

or they're looking at art and literature based on their conception of
"the canon" and how works fit into that imaginary library in the sky.
that's one way to interact with creative works, especially when you
can't otherwise relate to/understand what you have in front of you. but
it's so limiting! =20

isn't the "cult of the amateur" a recent phenomenon, according to Keen?
so he's reacting to what he sees as a cheapening, broadening,
de-eternalizing of artistic creation? same as it ever was, Baby. let him
wring his hands: time washes over his work, too.=20

I only believe in Great Art if it's been around as long as the Lascaux
cave paintings -- as someone once said, aim high or die trying.
(actually it was me, just now.)

why privelege the poem?  We privelege poems everyday by writing them.  Also, it seems to me that transferring something from one medium to another is a case where copyright or patents become less important.  This may not be the law of the matter, if there is any, but it seems to be the practice of many, certainly on the internet.  I writee many poems while watching films, plays, operas, and visual art.  Usually when I post these poems on Wryting-L I include a note as to the source.  It is currently a matter of issue for me whether or not to include these notes when the poems are published in book form.  Regards, Tom Savage

okay, but you originally wrote 'unless it comes from someone else's poem, to
just include it without bothering...' which, to me, is different then saying
'i privilege poems everyday by writing them'

and the transfer from medium to medium part copyrights/patents become 'less

What I am priveleging in that sense is that if it comes from someone else's poem, it should be acknowledged as such since what is being written by you or someone is also a poem.  This makes sense to me and is thus, as you say, personal.  But if we are to establish any guidelines for what is proper use of another's material, it makes sense to me that this be an exception to the general nonrule of appropriation of anything as now occurs.  Of course there are examples of poets who did this without acknowledgement (Ted Berrigan comes immediately to mind in this regard).  But I suspect that in his case, he felt that the sources of his appropriations were likely to be obbvious to the readers of his poetry.  Perhaps not.  Regards, Tom Savage

Ezra Pound was very upset about mass publishing in his time.  Where do I
recall him being upset about this?  Maybe THE ABC of READING book?

And I say HOORAY!  Okay, let me enter this again with a hooray, because, it
feels important, and feels important enough to talk about it out loud and as
often as possible.

My saying HOORAY, or hooray, is due to my excitement that art is FINALLY
getting out of the hands of those who want the python grip around its neck.
Art is simply too big, and only getting bigger!

"Mediocre Art" gets thrown around on this List ever once in a while and it
makes me chuckle.  I mean, YES there are those who devote far more time to
their craft than others, but c'mon, isn't there room for everyone?  You
don't HAVE TO LIKE everything, but GEE FUCKING WHIZ let's make some room
here!

That passion and excitement you get when you create, isn't that something
you want EVERYONE to feel?  Because I sure do!  I will FIGHT with anyone and
everyone standing in the way of this until I'm dead.

Look, I HATE A LOT OF POETRY, but it's none of my fucking business if people
want to write poetry that I don't want to read.  It's better to encourage
creativity, for many reasons (not the least of which being that we will
never change this fucked up world unless everyone's involved with the
creative process)

The Internet, and blogs, these are the tools to open the world up.  The only
thing laid to ruin will be the cliche of the fucking bourgeois stuffed
shirts who think they know more than everyone else.

Art is here to liberate, not stifle!  When Breton said "Art will be
convulsive or not at all!" was he fingering the direction of the
convulsion?  Not in my book!  You convulse on your own, it's all your own!
And fuck off to anyone who would stand in the way of that.

Here's to Art that we Love, and to Art that pisses us off!

Neurosis [taps head]

I'm as sick of these avatars as you are. This one has 37 actions which
pile on each other like an avalanche. This one has a roving veering
camera. This one has that one. I need to work on other models. This one
has new skin. I need to take it elsewhere. This one's lost its objects.
This one goes round and round. I spoke to Foofwa. He needs live audience
for dance/performance work. I need live audience but I need equipment. I
sit here in this damn hot NYC space and can't think of a thing to do.
There's great mocap stuff at Columbia in Chicago. I'd love to use it.
[taps head] Anyone have contacts/context? I saw it. I think there were
twelve cameras. I saw the connections. I could rewire. I could make
something fabulous. I could make something new. Something unbelievable. I
could expand the vocabulary of the human body, abjection, interiority,
performance. You're sick of hearing me complain. I could expand the
vocabulary of sickness. I could expand the vocabulary of complaint. It's
all in here [taps head]. There's nothing without equipment. Without
support. Without a life-net. We're all waiting to hear our future. There's
a great cave at Brown. Give me access to that cave and support me. I'll
produce like you won't believe. In the meantime I sit here in 85 degree
computer slowup weather and write stuff like this and make stuff like
this:

published by random house, publicized by the financial times and the poetics

won't be buying it, though. too predictable.

Great art?  Or, well, what does "great" mean?  Is longevity re: Lascaux the
primary measure?  Time seems such an ungenerous measure . . . of anything.
So does "eternity", whatever that may be - the whole Gestalt?  It seems to
me that a poet cannot practice as either a "professional" or an "amateur",
but only as a god who will lose his way . . . even, and especially, where
clear directions are "given".  Isn't defining the universe, its various
words and definitions, ultimately (?) destructive to that aspect of the
universe that nevertheless attempts (as if it had a consciousness of its own
. . . ) to remain elusive?  We might refer here to Edward Dorn's lovely
poem, "That's The Way I Hear The Momentum."  Or that in "getting lost" -
attentively - one might come to the factual curvature of space that J.H.
Prynne once claimed (in additional reference to Olson and Blake), "was
love."  Perhaps great = single, as of the cosmos.  Which implies a
completeness.  Completeness itself implying recurrance.  And recurrance
suggesting the closure in which "no miracle is possible."  So there we are.
Back to our catholic tastes once again.

rounding out the Minnesota contingent here: my latest run-ins have been

just coming at this with a fool's-cap full of economics, poli sci and
casual observation, but isn't this "controversy" just a kind of
commercial positioning?=20

isn't this another example of the trend toward privileging one kind of
work -- as defined by the (artificial/non-existent) elite that Keen
seems to speak for -- and demanding the marginalization of all the rest?

I've never read Keen's work and only know his position through this
chain, but do you think we'll be seeing him promote his book on O'Reilly
any time soon?=20

here's another take on Keen's unease at the debasement of culture 'n

my point was not about academia vs "out there." it was a critique of the

cult of elitism among folks who don't know what they're talking about,=20
i.e. "entrepreneurs" complaining about artistic mediocrity on the
internet.

academia examines that art. I think that it is important to know where
your art is coming from. Does the artist have a perspective on the tools
and form of expression? Has the artist viewed or read art to get a sense
of its history, how it fits into the culture, etc. Some of the most
exciting art (including writing) has been created outside of academia.
It is simply harder to live and create without academic support, but
then it is also hard to live and create within academia. I see all the
poetry that is being written now, and I know that little of it will
survive the years, including my own. I guess I don't write for that
reason. Why the hell do we create anyway? I ask myself that all the

I doubt they know what they mean by "Great Art" -- to my ears it's as
tinny and false a phrase as "the Great American Novel," and I tend to
think that people who throw such expressions around are the least
capable of recognizing work that's worth investing time in.

or they're looking at art and literature based on their conception of
"the canon" and how works fit into that imaginary library in the sky.
that's one way to interact with creative works, especially when you
can't otherwise relate to/understand what you have in front of you. but
it's so limiting!

isn't the "cult of the amateur" a recent phenomenon, according to Keen?
so he's reacting to what he sees as a cheapening, broadening,
de-eternalizing of artistic creation? same as it ever was, Baby. let him
wring his hands: time washes over his work, too.

I only believe in Great Art if it's been around as long as the Lascaux
cave paintings -- as someone once said, aim high or die trying.
(actually it was me, just now.)

Based on the text of this post (an excerpt of an item from the "Ask the
Expert" section of the Financial Times web site), I would speculate
that Andrew Keen really fears that the anarchy of the Internet is
threatening the ability of other ~Silicon Valley entrepreneurs~ to earn
a livelihood from their talents. Earning a livelihood from my talent as
a poet has never been much of an option. But I've been writing all my
adult life (since 1980) anyway. And self-publishing in various forms,
off and on, on the Internet since 1996.

I would imagine that the majority of poets/artists who earn a living in
academia (since I don't I'm merely speculating here) are paid, for the
most part, for doing things (teaching, administration etc.) other than
writing poetry/making art.

But I don't think Keen is really concerned about poets being threatened
by the Internet. And I won't be reading/buying the book. I'm too busy
earning a livelihood and reading ~War and Peace~ (really!), ~Peirce and
Pragmatism~ by W.B. Gallie and ~Learning SQL~ by Alan Beaulieu. Neither
will I be online at 9pm on Thursday to ask him questions about it.

I did enjoy CA Conrad's rant in response to this.

It's all a little familiar to me. In my neck of the woods, the blogosphere
is the only place that decent, thoughtful criticism takes place! It sure
isn't in my local newspapers, which are (a) disinterested (b) often make
factual errors and (c) are depressingly homogenous.

Consequently, a lot of arts journalists (and not only here) are getting a
little paranoid. Check out this fierce debate

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Books I like and some hardware/software as well (not much)


I'm behind in my reviews; the last few months have been a mess. I may be
missing some books. I may have misplaced. others. I hunger for reading,
but it's all transparent, pathetic, collapsed. There's nothing to say
about reading that hasn't been said before. Humans compress history's
repetition until the world's squeezed out. If I'm missing a book in what
follows, forgive me; the oversight wasn't deliberate, just an effect of
physiology. The following books are in no particular order; for the most
part, they're books that have been more than useful, have been inspira-
tional, works I've returned to at times. I'm including some miscellaneous
reviews of software/hardware as well. (First off, apologies for the poor
style below; it's hard for me to convey sustained excitement, but such
underlies most of what follows.)

Buddhist Dictionary, Manual of Buddhist Terms and Doctrines, Nyanatiloka,
Buddhist Publication Society, Sri Lanka. This is an amazing and often
technical work, documenting the terms of the Pali Canon and beyond; it has
information I literally haven't found elsewhere. The Pali vocabulary is
extensive, often highly structured conceptually, and this has proved, not
only to be an invaluable guide, but also an interesting read in itself.

I am a Cat (three volumes), Soseki Natsume, translated Aiko Ito and Graeme
Wilson. The original Japanese work appeared in the first decade of the
20th century; it's an amazing rumination on everything by a cat. The work
is reminiscent of Sterne and I found myself enveloped in it (in a manner
similar to reading something like The Journey to the West); it says a
great deal about Japanese modernization and city life, and is beautifully
written. It's not an 'animal' story in any sense of the term. The work's
available from Tuttle. (Alexanne Don introduced me to this years ago.)

Murray's Hand-Book, India, Burma, and Ceylon, 1898. The world's population
around the time of the French Revolution was twenty-million (according to
Mike Davis, Planet of Slums - required reading). This is another travel-
er's guide, along the lines of the Baedeker's, and is incredibly illumina-
ting in terms of British/colonial attitudes towards the 'Far East' at the
end of the 19th century. It also provides descriptions of places long
since transformed by modernization and war. I've been collecting travel
guides from 1850-1940 for a while now; they're fairly inexpensive, and one
can learn so much by reading, say, the Baedeker on Weimar Berlin. (I used
a Baedeker on Switzerland, late 19th-century, when we were working in the
Alps - the differences in glaciers and routes were of great interest.)

Body Voyage, A Three-Dimensional Tour of a Real Human Body, Alexander
Tsiaras, Time-Warner, 1997. Remember the Visible Human Project? This is a
pictorial overview of the body slices that appeared at the time in another
Time-Warner publication, a cdrom with 'flights' through the body. Both
were and are, even in the current climate of war and plastination, wonder-
ful; they've led to my rethinking avatar phenomenology. Unlike the plas-
tination approach, these images are grounded in the real, but entrenched
in the virtual; they relate to the continuous problematic/aporia of
online/offline life. Check this out if you can.

Japan's Sex Trade, A Journey Through Japan's Erotic Subcultures, Peter
Constantine, Yenbooks, 1993. The title says it all; this is an excellent
and detailed history/description of sex clubs, practices, economies, and
so forth, centered in Tokyo. Think of avatar behavior and imaginary
contact, think of contact with the imaginary; this book is useful.

The Book Before Printing, Ancient, Medieval, and Oriental, David Diringer,
Dover reprint from 1953 original. I think this might be valuable to anyone
thinking through online literature; we tend to take the book and it's
overall topography for granted, but this is a bit ethno-centric. This work
presents a wide range of writing and reading technologies; it's a bit
dated at times in its attitude, but somewhere in it a thesis lurks on
hypertext and the Net.

Competing with the Sylph, The Quest for the Perfect Dance Body, L.M.
Vincent, M.D., Dance Horizons, 1989. Because I work with dancers, who are
already partaking of the imaginary, I've been interested in dancers'
bodies, disorders, and so forth. I deal with this issues, and this book,
however rambling and strange, is one of the better accounts of at least
some of the issues. Read the book, build an avatar, dream of escaping
Second Life: they're all related. Now the book is almost twenty-years old,
admittedly; the material might be out of date.

New Media Art, Mark Tribe, Reena Jana, ed. Uta Grosenick, Taschen, 2006.
Everything is new media art; there is no new media art; there are no new
media; everything is new media, etc. etc. It comes down, I think to what
one's interested in; I find manifestos and exclusionary politics detri-
mental in an environment of over a billion communicators. That said, this,
for me, has been one of the most interesting accounts of at least some
online work; Carnivore, Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries, Jodi, Natalie
Jeremijenko, etc. are included. I'd get this one and then get as many
others as possible and then stay online for hours on end, read the entire
archives of nettime, install linux, check out all the websites you can;
then you might get at least an image of new media, or maybe not, and you'd
have to repeat the whole thing the following week anyway.

Film as a Subversive Art, Amos Vogel, Random House, 1974. Find this, buy
this, read it. This is one of the most inspiring books on film, from
experimental to counter-culture to, yes, subversive, ever. If you're
making film, read this; if you're watching Turner Classic Movies late-
night, read this. The book is heavy on the 60s, but does a good job on
very early cinema as well - and it stresses those auteurs, etc. who turned
film and culture upside-down. There's an image of Fred Baker's Events with
the comment "The most dangerous image known to man (sic.) Though it por-
trays the most universal, most fundamental, most desired human act, it
must not be shown (either in its joining of bodies or coupling of organs),
be it because sex is (still) considered sinful or because of an atavistic
fear that the act will spring from the screen and invade the audience with
its heavenly power. As long as this image is forbidden, its presentation
will be a liberating act." There's a romanticism in this and the book as a
whole for that matter, but its emphasis on the materiality of film and
filmic representation is a great antidote to the smooth swallowing of
current mass media.

Bharata, The Natyasastra, Kapila Vatsyayan, Sahitya Akademi, 1996, and Dr.
Manomohan Ghosh's translation of the full Natyasastra by Bharata in two
volumes, Calcutta, various editions. The first is somewhat of an explica-
tion of the second, and invaluable in its analysis of the 'implicit and
explicit text'; it also lists all the known mss. of the Natyasastra. The
original may or may not have been written between 200 b.c.e. and 100
a.c.e. or earlier. It is a compendium of Indian dramaturgical theory which
includes poetry, song, drama, dance, art, theater construct, and music; it
is perhaps the first phenomenological treatise of performance and its
theory of rasa is still influential today. I've used the work in my own
studies and writings on performance. I can't say enough good about it! One
has to wade through endless listings, read between the lines and as many
introductions as one can find, in order to understand the theory and its
foundation. But such a reading provides an inexhaustible sourcebook for
current art - particularly for understanding avatars and their positioning
culturally and in relation to the body. You can find cheap editions on abe
and other second-hand sources; order both volumes (as well as Vatsyayan's
introduction) from India.

How to Play Tabla and Bongo-Congo with Pictures; and How to Play Flute,
both by Vikas Aggarwal, Creative Publication, Delhi. These are excellent
introductions to Indian music and tabla/flute technique (forget the bongo-
congo (sic)!), although the English is so bad, and there are so many
untranslated terms, that I've been literally driven crazy, trying to make
heads or tails out of these. But if you have patience, look up the terms
online, and so forth, these will prove quite useful. Order from India;
when they're imported, the prices seem to rise unacceptably.

Avatars of Story, Marie-Laurie Ryan, Minnesota, 2006. I love this book,
although my method of reading has been to bounce around in it. Everything
from offline through Eliza and Olia Lialina is considered in terms of
avatar and narrative; there's a useful typology of games and a discussion
of narrative metalepsis, transgressive break of the 'narrative stack.'
Codework and Memmott and Cayley are brought up in relation to this. I must
admit I don't see Cayley's work as 'codework' but he's cited over and over
again; I'd be a lot happier with Cramer or Baldwin or anyone else really
working in the area (obviously I have a stake in this). If we don't get
down to the abject heart of the semiotic, we'll never understand this
area, if area it is. Ah well; do read the book; again, it expands the
notion of avatar/s which seems to dominate these reviews.

The Barons' Wars, Mymphidia, and Other Poems, Michael Drayton, Routledge,
1887. He's a contemporary and probably friend of Shakespeare. I've been
reading his sonnets, which seem half towards Donne and half oddly post-
modern and for that reason alone, they're really worth a look.

The Singing Life of Birds, The Art and Science of Listening to Birdsong,
with CD, Donald Kroodsma, Houghton Mifflin, 2005. If anything this book
indicates how deaf we really are; birdsongs are amazing, starlings sing
recursively (previously thought a primary condition of human language),
some species have upwards of 2400 different songs; there are regional
dialects; some species sing instinctual patterns, most don't; and so
forth. We're dealing with languaging here, not 'bird-brains' in any sense
but the literal, of the word. This book not only has extended accounts of
a number of species, but also a tight correlation with the cd; I began to
understand what I was listening to. This is really highly recommended; we
have to do everything we can to break down anthrospeciation (is that a
word?) - and begin to understand, if not the consciousness, at least the
cultural manifestations, of animals in general.

Letter to a King, A Peruvian Chief's Account of Life Under the Incas and
Under Spanish Rule, Huaman Poma, translated by Christopher Dilke, Dutton,
1978. I definitely want to draw your attention to this book, since I
haven't heard of it (and should have). It not only complements the
'classic' accounts of the conquest and its aftermath; it reads as new and
vital material. If you're interested in this area of culture and history,
find and read the book. Given the quality, I'm amazed it's been unknown
(at least to me) for so long. Heavily illustrated by the original author.

Planet of Slums, Mike Davis, Verso, 2006. This book is critical; everyone
should read it. Material on the future of the world; I saw this first-hand
at work in Ciudad Juarez and now it's fifteen years later. This isn't
virtual, but virtuality plays a role, Harry Potter as catalyst to accusa-
tions of witchcraft in Zaire. Davis is known for theatrical, almost roman-
ticized, accounts of Armageddon; the problem is they're true. The work is
excellent as source-material, bibliography, as well.

The Alpbach Symposium 1968, Beyond Reductionism, New Perspectives in the
Life Sciences, edited by Arthur Koestler and J.R. Smythies. There was a
brief period when semiotics, holism, cybernetics, mini-computers, systems
theory, Waddington's evolutionary theory, etc. came together in a wonder-
ful synthesis. One doesn't hear Waddington's name anymore, and most
syntheses have broken apart in the light of dark matter, Iraq, extinctions
and global warmings. But this book and others like it serve as a reminder
that there might be hope yet, that visions might still, on some level,
cohere. This book has Koestler's Some General Properties of Self-Regulat-
ing Open Hierarchic Order, which is well worth the read.

Overtime, Selected Poems, Philip Whalen, intro. by Leslie Scalapino,
edited by Michael Rothenberg. My fault, but I never had a 'hold' on Whalen
before, and this book (like the one following) is an absolutely wonderful
and deep and wry collection; this is an important - perhaps _the_ impor-
tant strain in American literature, giving as it does some knowledge of
space and the wild in the very strain of the language. It's a book I can
return to again and again (that sounds idiotic but it's true). I would
recommend everyone get a copy of this as well as

The Gary Snyder Reader, 1952-1998. (See the above.) Not to mention the
obvious connections w/Buddhism and perhaps a bit of Bon.

Semiotique, dictionnaire raisonne de la theorie du langage, A.J. Greimas
and J. Courtes, Hachette, 1979. One can have fun with serious French
dictionaries, and this one is inspiring; I hadn't heard of it before
(which indicates my ignorance), but I've found it very very useful.

Mind-Seal of the Buddhas, Patriarch Ou-i, translated J.C. Cleary, Sutra
Translation Committee. This book is distributed freely and the Sutra is
beautiful, as is the description of the Pure Land. And I think I've
mentioned before Thomas Cleary's translation of The Flower Ornament Sutra
(referenced by the Mind-Seal), The Avatamsaka Sutra, the most beautiful
Sutra I've ever read, and a masterpiece of world literature - it's also
one of the longest Sutra around! (Are the Clearys related? The Clearies?)

Introduction to the Middle Way, Chandrakirtis Madhyamakavatara with
Commentary by Jamgon Mipham, translated by the Padmakara Translation
Group, Shambhala, 2002. I can't really review this, since I've been
reading in it very inconsistently, but if you're interested in Buddhist
philosophical discourse or the Madhyamika school, this book is perfect.

Devices of the Soul, Battling for Our Selves in an Age of Machines, Steve
Talbott, O'Reilly, 2007. This is a collection of articles originally
published in The Nature Institute's online newsletter, NetFuture (they've
been revised for the book). I must note his comments on bird-feeders are
off; he states that 'A feeder draws a dense, "unnatural" population of
birds to a small area. This not only encourages the spread of disease, but
also evokes behavioral patterns one might never see in a less artificial
habitat.' In fact recent studies have shown feeders are not detrimental,
that birds can go easily with or without them, but that they're convenient
- and the animals don't become dependent. But then this might not be right
either; in any case, he calls for a conversancy with the natural world
that rings true. The book is written simply, which is wonderful; at first,
I thought too much so - then I was irritated, now I love it. One has to
approach machines with care, one has to deconstruct the rhetoric around
them. This isn't a Luddite work at all; it's an interesting analysis in
favor of a conversant humanism. He takes for example Rodney Brooks to task
for his analysis of humans-as-machines. This book is a must for anyone
working on the social-machine interface, from someone in the field.
(Talbott wrote The Future Does not Computer and has been a software pro-
grammar. He writes from the inside-out.)

Recorders: I generally use Sony Minidisk for my work, but recently I've
been interested in different technologies. Here's an older one - the Sony
Mic'n Micro M-100MC micro-cassette recorder 'For Lectures and Meetings' -
and its fabulous for both. It has something called 'Clear Voice' built in;
the result is not very high-quality sound, but an absolutely perfect way
to record voice, which comes through loud and, yes, clear. The recorder
can be placed anywhere - on a table in a coffee-shop for example, and does
a good job taking out background noise, and focusing on speech. I almost
bought one of these new a few weeks ago, but found the same for $3 at a
garage sale. I also want to recommend the Olympus Digital Voice Recorder
WS-300M; this is also an .mp3 and .wma player, but more importantly, it's
solid-state, it's recording quality is quite good, and it can be plugged
directly into a USB connection. I've been using it for film/video work
since it also has a very delicate voice activation control which makes 03
interesting effects.

Head, w/ The Monkees, 1968. Check out this film written by Jack Nicholson.
Monkees deconstruct, implode. No plot, no beginning titles, pure celluloid
roll. Sequences break down, Vietnam images ending with blonds. Monkees
self-destruct. Play this against Apocalypse Now; they're not that dissimi-
lar. I was never a Monkees fan, but neither is this film. It's astounding.
Brilliant. Look for Victor Mature, Frank Zappa, Sony Liston, others.

GraphCalc - I was looking for a good scientific calculator to work with in
WinXP, and I found this free one on Sourceforge. It's excellent, based
somewhat I think on the TI graphing calculators, but with much more
computing power, of course. I found a TI-85 at a garage sale recently for
$2. It's much more useful than I thought it would be; not only does it
program, but it has built-in functions like cosh and tanh, does parametric
equations, polar coordinates, and has really good zooming capabilities. I
started working with the equation y = sqrt(k - f(x)*tan(x^2)) on it (which
is similar to just y = tan(x^2) in terms of the raster patterns it pro-
duces. Highly recommended for fiddlers.

The John Franklin Bardin Omnibus (The Deadly Percheron, The Last of Philip
Banter, Devil Take the Blue-Tail Fly), Penguin, 1976. These novels are
amazing, reminiscent of Philip K. Dick; I hadn't heard of Bardin before.
These were written in the 1940s and are like nothing else in the period.
They're dark, psychological, ridden with issues of identity and potential
madness - check them out.

A few sites of interest - the Odyssey art and performance page on Ning,
http://odysseyart.ning.com/ and Odyssey in Second Life - the work of Gaz,
Sugar Seville, Patrick Lichty, Ian Ah, among others; Facebook but not
Myspace; and why are my listings going down in Google week after week?
Check out the amazing repository / archive of files at
http://www.textfiles.com/directory.html . For the best discussion of
climate I've seen, go to Real Climate, http://www.realclimate.org/ . If
you don't know NOAA weather, you should; the site has complete discussion
of current conditions in the US, as well as the phenomenology behind them
- NOAA at http://www.weather.gov/ .

Ossi Oswalda!!! - has become my favorite silent film star, after seeing
her in Ernst Lubitsch's The Oyster Princess (Die Austernprinzessin), 1919,
and I don't want to be a Man (Ich mochte kein Mann sein), 1920. Her acting
is furious and incredibly intense, comedic with a very dark edge something
like the early Courtney Love. I'm trying to find more of her work. I don't
want to be a man is way ahead of its time, and The Oyster Princess is so
over the top that it's interesting today - not as 'silent film' - but as
brilliant satire.

Abel Gance's Napoleon - this is just one of the most brilliant silent
films ever, almost unobtainable today. It was originally made for
simultaneous triple projection; the images were interlocked in all sorts
of ways. There's a VHS version you might find second-hand; I had it
converted to two DVDs (the film's quite long). If you haven't heard of
this, look it up online; needless to say it's amazing.

Siva Purana, Uttarakhanda, Text with English Translation and Introduction,
Dr. U.N. Dhal, Nag, 2000. Anything about Siva is going to be terrific -
this is a translation of a major portion of the Purana. Sanskrit and an
odd English rendering are given. You can find this, again, online - order
direct from India (through abe).

I don't feel I've done my homework on the Purana, done Steve Talbott
justice, understood the ins and outs of the Madhyamika; I travel far too
quickly through regions I know little about. I want to know Chinese and
Japanese and cuneiform, but don't have the time or ability to _sit still_
and learn them. I read Make magazine - an O'Reilly publication I swear by
- but I haven't built anything but a VLF radio and antenna in years. I
scurry too quickly - I worry too much about death and this summer I don't
have my favorite laboratory machines to play with. I'm afraid reading
novels take up too much time; Whalen and Snyder are caresses. I don't want
to end up like Ossi Oswalda or at least without doing something as good as
her work was. I want to learn more about the Planet of Slums and do some-
thing about the human condition. I'm lazy and arrogant and run around
signing petitions at best. In any case at one point I read a biography of
the (real) monk in The Journey to the West, he brought thousands of Bud-
dhist scriptures to China, and I wonder how many people were alive then
and what were they carrying?

The fear of freedom is one of the greatest psychological problems of our time.  I have not read this book nor do I intend to.  If the description I read of it here is correct, it sounds like the author is anal retentive.  It is the nature of the definition of the word " mediocre" that in any large pool of artistic submissions, the majority will be mediocre or worse.  The question to be posed then is whether the level of that mediocrity is rising or falling in quality.  On this point, only time will tell whether Youtube, Myspace, etc. will provide us with work of lasting interest to audiences other than the creators of the material.  Still the freedom of unfettered access to expression must be counted a good thing, I believe.

Andrew Keen, a former Silicon Valley entrepreneur, has set the blogosphere alight with his new book, a scathing attack on user-generated content. Sub-titled “How the Internet is killing our culture? Keen’s book is a polemic against the “anything goes?standards of much of online publishing.
Keen does not believe in “the wisdom of the crowd? Much of the content filling up YouTube, MySpace, and blogs is just an “an endless digital forest of mediocrity?which, unconstrained by professional standards or editorial filters, can alter public debate and manipulate public opinion
He also fears that the free swapping, downloading, mashing-up and aggregating of intellectual property threaten the ability of artists and thinkers with contributions of real value to earn a livelihood from their talents.
‘The Cult of the Amateur?is published by Random House on June 5. Andrew Keen will be online to answer questions about his book on Thursday June 7 at 2pm BST (9am EDT).

should add that amid data glut, not only good searchability is important,
but also that which enables good searchability, which is the underlying
republic/unrepublic of art: the network of writings and links betwixt them
that searchability is predicated (and indexed) upon.

the network of writings and links--and, of course, the relationships
implicit therein--not only form a web that allows people to surf from site
to site, but also form a structure that allows search engines to usefully
map the dictionary (plus phrases) to sites.

so, although searchability is important, it is predicated upon, indexed
upon, presumably reflective of the language and relationships that exist on
the net via hypertext and its links. which is something *we* create page by
page, link by link.

i'm sort of contradicting myself from a previous post called 'the unrepublic
of art', but not really. i mean it's a radically haywire structure, isn't
it.

And YES, I agree with you.  Yet I don't think any other time period was any
less burdened with this problem, considering the endless obsessive
compulsive behaviors taught by religions, etc. for fear of freedom of one
kind or another.

BUT YES, it's so true, this fear of freedom.  The freedom to ALLOW the
creative core to vibrate for instance.  And then the freedom to ALLOW the
creative core of others to vibrate.

This reminds me of a poet (can't remember who this was right now) who
complained a couple of years ago that "SOON EVERYONE'S GOING TO HAVE A BLOG
AND THEN THE BLOGS WON'T MEAN ANYTHING!"  What?!!!?  I wrote to him and
said, "You mean YOUR blog will mean less, don't you?  You like being
special, is that it?  What are you afraid of exactly?  Don't be ridiculous!
Your getting on my nerves!"  I wrote things like that to him until he
finally stopped bugging me.

I've consistently heard poets say, "There's just too many poets now!"
What?  NO!  There can never be enough!  There's SO MUCH MORE ROOM when
there's so many you can't keep track of them.  The more poets there are the
less room there is to make one of them a victim of your jealousy or envy.
The writer's diseases will be SO CONFOUNDED by the sheer numbers surrounding
them that some choices will have to be made:

1) either kill yourself, or stop writing, or play video games, or watch tv
all day, or drink

2) or accept the space that is now available in this massive wave to create
and to see that despite all the games so many poets play (especially some of
our nervous elder poets dividing and manipulating us into categories)
and accept the space and the FREEDOM the actual and real FREEDOM of that
space to create and to do the best you can with the life you have and know
that everything else is bull

I would second this, but say that the personal decision is ideally an
artistic one. Nothing trumps practice, discovering what works and what
doesn't, and "works" means more than following a position or applying a
theory.

And YES, I agree with you.  Yet I don't think any other time period was
any
less burdened with this problem, considering the endless obsessive
compulsive behaviors taught by religions, etc. for fear of freedom of
one
kind or another.

BUT YES, it's so true, this fear of freedom.  The freedom to ALLOW the
creative core to vibrate for instance.  And then the freedom to ALLOW
the
creative core of others to vibrate.

This reminds me of a poet (can't remember who this was right now) who
complained a couple of years ago that "SOON EVERYONE'S GOING TO HAVE A
BLOG
AND THEN THE BLOGS WON'T MEAN ANYTHING!"  What?!!!?  I wrote to him and
said, "You mean YOUR blog will mean less, don't you?  You like being
special, is that it?  What are you afraid of exactly?  Don't be
ridiculous!
Your getting on my nerves!"  I wrote things like that to him until he
finally stopped bugging me.

I've consistently heard poets say, "There's just too many poets now!"
What?  NO!  There can never be enough!  There's SO MUCH MORE ROOM when
there's so many you can't keep track of them.  The more poets there are
the
less room there is to make one of them a victim of your jealousy or
envy.
The writer's diseases will be SO CONFOUNDED by the sheer numbers
surrounding
them that some choices will have to be made:

1) either kill yourself, or stop writing, or play video games, or watch
tv
all day, or drink

2) or accept the space that is now available in this massive wave to
create
and to see that despite all the games so many poets play (especially
some of
our nervous elder poets dividing and manipulating us into categories)
and accept the space and the FREEDOM the actual and real FREEDOM of that
space to create and to do the best you can with the life you have and
know
that everything else is bull

Thanks, Catherine. I made notes at first because nobody (or very few =
bodies)
seemed to have heard of people like Felix Dzerzhinsky, Bebe Rebozo, and
Vigd=EDs Finnbogad=F3ttir. We live in a country without historical =
memories. Or,
apparently, maps.

Then I made notes because they amused me. I see them as hotlinks within =

Isn't the republic/unrepublic of art: that very network of writings and
links
the same as it's ever been... just now cybernated?

And, as far as the levels of mediocrity rising and falling... isn't this
just a
question of velocity and volume... but, also, same as it ever was?

I would second this, but say that the personal decision is ideally an
artistic one. Nothing trumps practice, discovering what works and what
doesn't, and "works" means more than following a position or applying a
theory.

okay, but you originally wrote 'unless it comes from someone else's poem, to
just include it without bothering...' which, to me, is different then saying
'i privilege poems everyday by writing them'

and the transfer from medium to medium part copyrights/patents become 'less
important' too

i am interested in why you think these things are more or less important as
it is clearly a personal decision (yours)

Peace On A

presents

Sasha Steensen & Charles Valle

Tuesday, June 12th 2007 8PM
BYOB & recommended donation: $5

hosted by Thom Donovan at:

166 Avenue A, Apartment #2
New York, NY 10009

about the readers:

Sasha Steensen is the author of *A Magic Book* (Fence Books) and *correspondence* (with Gordon
Hadfield, Handwritten Press).
Her new manuscript, *The Method*, is forthcoming from Fence Books.  Recent work has appeared or is
forthcoming in Aufgabe, Denver Quarterly, Shiny, Shearsman, and the anthology *Not For Mothers
Only: Contemporary Poems on Child-Getting and Child-Rearing* (Fence Books). She is one of the
poetry editors of Colorado Review and a co-editor of Bonfire Press.  She teaches
Creative Writing at Colorado State University.

THIS PLAIN PLACE

Nothing has happened in this place
and it happened forever
until recently.
It was forever happening
amid Method's fluctuating vision.
He heard rustling in the bushes,
the bandicoot poking around in its pouch,
to pull finally nothing
out.

He understood the animal's sorrow
to find plainly and without denial
emptiness where a relation ought to be
a deep and majestic blue
into which one carefully
places
a heart,
plainly
steps back,
places
a body around
a heart,
steps back
into a past place where
only the monks,
deathly afraid of nothing,
turn the deaf
away.


Charles Valle works in educational publishing. His works have appeared in various literary
journals-- most recently 2ndavepoetry.com. He sleeps, spins records, and eats pupusas in Brooklyn.

SKEIN

She will read your arterial
curves pressed flat—gathered in a box,

she will imagine a language
for your seasons—she, who only

translates fall as the ending
of monsoons—she will create

your branch, your roots digging down…

What do you say to someone

who cannot name new worlds?

find the green one with five fingers on fire

For some writers, I imagine that's true. But not for others. Not for me, for
instance. The links on http://vispo.com/misc/links.htm contain many links to
digital poetry, to types of literary work that are fairly new, and those
sites usually do the same (differently). And the links maintained by Jorge
Luiz Antonio to Brazilian digital poetry at
http://vispo.com/misc/BrazilianDigitalPoetry.htm are, again, to relatively
new types of work. Same with the links at http://vispo.com/misc/ia.htm to
interactive audio. And the guest work at http://vispo.com/guests is, for the
most part, to new types of work.

If the net were solely a cybernated recapitulation of the networks that
pre-date the net, it would be same old. But it isn't, and that's important
to its poetential formally and socially.

Yet there's also a place for the same as its ever been. And for relation
between them and other networks.

The net has a way of bringing x into relation with y. Whether x and y are
people or ideas or media types or arts or whatever.

It's easy to publish on the net. That makes for a lot of dross. But, also,
anyone who's been online for years has surely seen the net grow in the
quality of information that's available, also, if you know how to find it
and distinguish it from less valuable information.

For instance, if you google a topic, you may wade through dross until you
find something good. From there, you may go back to google, but perhaps a
better strategy is to check the links from the good stuff first.

To be a little flip, but not much, I hope the Internet is indeed destroying
our culture. And helping something more interesting emerge. Of course, this
is so, but it's also true that it's helping all sorts of ugly things emerge.
The Internet is great at helping avant garde poets get into communication
internationally, but it's also good at helping money launderers etc
communicate more effectively.

It's and. and or. not exclusive or. it's not only this but also that. or at
least one of those. if x and y are related, x and y is sure to follow. it is
a force in driving things to their logical conclusions and to their secret
correspondents, each one. it identifies but also creates relations. it is a
creator and destroyer. but mainly people are creators and destroyers, not
the technology. yet the technology *does* have behavior. that is written.
language. language*, language**...

"Lazy bother" is more like it, especially this day and age when the only re=
ason to move is the match-flame under the ass. I read (because I don't spea=
k Japanese)in "Ikiru" (Kurosawa) that laziness is safe because then everyth=
ing remains the same and there's nothing to fight about (the fighting goes =
on under our noses, which hides among the aromas of McDonaldization).

Thanks for bringing light to this free-association, my friend Kevin Thursto=
n.

Oh, Kevin,
you are so lucky!
Basel is a wonderful art city.
You've seen the Tinguely, eh?
There is a von Stuck in the big gallery.
Keep an eye out on the rooftops of the upper city.
Smiling. There's a lot of smiling in Basel, too.

It's so obvious why some in the mainstream press would be so pissed off about the success of bloggers, because bloggers do for free what they do for a living.  So naturally they would try to degrade and demote bloggers.

I don't know what the problem is though.  In golf, tennis, sewing, and every other human endeavor except brain surgery, there are amateurs and there are professionals; and then there are amateurs who are near good enough to be pros.  Why is it so upsetting that there are now writer bloggers who have a free, open way to write about whatever they want to a willing audience?  If the writing is no good, the audience will quickly back away.

Please note, I'm a new resident here on the Poetics List, and I also host and read my work at an Open Mic at Geoffrey's Bohemian Bistro in Palmyra, New York (about 25 minutes east of Rochester, NY) every spring and fall.  If you're up around there stop in, it's free!  Details are on my web site habit.squarespace.com on the About Me page.

Enjoy your moment!

In "Asphodel, That Greeny Flower"?

". . . Look at
what passes for the new.
You will not find it there but in
Despised poems.
It is difficult
To get the news from poems
Yet men die miserably every day
For lack
Of what is found there"

(minus initial line spacing)

p. 318 of the second _Collected_ by New Directions. (Toward the very end of
the first section).

That's a passage many refer to when dealing with such issues.

(How many prepositions in a row might make sense?)

And YES, I agree with you.  Yet I don't think any other time period was
any
less burdened with this problem, considering the endless obsessive
compulsive behaviors taught by religions, etc. for fear of freedom of
one
kind or another.

BUT YES, it's so true, this fear of freedom.  The freedom to ALLOW the
creative core to vibrate for instance.  And then the freedom to ALLOW
the
creative core of others to vibrate.

This reminds me of a poet (can't remember who this was right now) who
complained a couple of years ago that "SOON EVERYONE'S GOING TO HAVE A
BLOG
AND THEN THE BLOGS WON'T MEAN ANYTHING!"  What?!!!?  I wrote to him and
said, "You mean YOUR blog will mean less, don't you?  You like being
special, is that it?  What are you afraid of exactly?  Don't be
ridiculous!
Your getting on my nerves!"  I wrote things like that to him until he
finally stopped bugging me.

I've consistently heard poets say, "There's just too many poets now!"
What?  NO!  There can never be enough!  There's SO MUCH MORE ROOM when
there's so many you can't keep track of them.  The more poets there are
the
less room there is to make one of them a victim of your jealousy or
envy.
The writer's diseases will be SO CONFOUNDED by the sheer numbers
surrounding
them that some choices will have to be made:

1) either kill yourself, or stop writing, or play video games, or watch
tv
all day, or drink

2) or accept the space that is now available in this massive wave to
create
and to see that despite all the games so many poets play (especially
some of
our nervous elder poets dividing and manipulating us into categories)
and accept the space and the FREEDOM the actual and real FREEDOM of that
space to create and to do the best you can with the life you have and
know

p.s. Thomas Savage, you're so lucky to have the name SAVAGE!
Are you a savage?  Do you live up to your name?  Just curious.
If my last name were Savage I'd be even more of a savage than I already

And YES, I agree with you.  Yet I don't think any other time period was
any
less burdened with this problem, considering the endless obsessive
compulsive behaviors taught by religions, etc. for fear of freedom of
one
kind or another.

BUT YES, it's so true, this fear of freedom.  The freedom to ALLOW the
creative core to vibrate for instance.  And then the freedom to ALLOW
the
creative core of others to vibrate.

This reminds me of a poet (can't remember who this was right now) who
complained a couple of years ago that "SOON EVERYONE'S GOING TO HAVE A
BLOG
AND THEN THE BLOGS WON'T MEAN ANYTHING!"  What?!!!?  I wrote to him and
said, "You mean YOUR blog will mean less, don't you?  You like being
special, is that it?  What are you afraid of exactly?  Don't be
ridiculous!
Your getting on my nerves!"  I wrote things like that to him until he
finally stopped bugging me.

I've consistently heard poets say, "There's just too many poets now!"
What?  NO!  There can never be enough!  There's SO MUCH MORE ROOM when
there's so many you can't keep track of them.  The more poets there are
the
less room there is to make one of them a victim of your jealousy or
envy.
The writer's diseases will be SO CONFOUNDED by the sheer numbers
surrounding
them that some choices will have to be made:

1) either kill yourself, or stop writing, or play video games, or watch
tv
all day, or drink

2) or accept the space that is now available in this massive wave to
create
and to see that despite all the games so many poets play (especially
some of
our nervous elder poets dividing and manipulating us into categories)
and accept the space and the FREEDOM the actual and real FREEDOM of that
space to create and to do the best you can with the life you have and
know
that everything else is bull

(I just got around to this post -- I'm behind in my
digest reading.)

I greatly enjoyed the Lisa Robertson issue, and in
fact, I was just re-reading parts of it this past
week.

I've held off on subscribing so far, and my main
problem is that when their is an issue I'd like to
pick up, it is almost impossible to find CR in
Minneapolis.    I happened to be in Chicago last
summer when I picked up the Robertson issue.  I had to
order the Zukofsky issue via the web, and I ordered
the Ronald Johnson back issue via the web, so that's
working for me.

Thanks for the good work.  Keep it up.

pac, lov and undrstanding (nvr giv up!)

MIME-Version: 1.0

Virtual, not Real

Two modes of writing, most likely among others: Well, I demonstrate (x);
well, I demonstrate (myself). The first compresses, contains, confuses the
object; the second smears the object within or against the code/work of
the text. To smear the object implies an onto-epistemological corruption
or breakdown; it is abjection that determines the problematic relationship
between self and object. To demonstrate (x) is to clarify an indexical
mapping between symbol and object; to demonstrate (myself) is to dis-em-
body both object and self; the ontological breakdown is between organism
and signifier; the epistemological breakdown implies that knowledge itself
is problematized across the boundary. Of course there isn't any boundary;
this is all non-sense - in other words, senseless, one can't make sense of
these things, there's nothing in the sense of sense as direction - can you
sense which way to go? The discussion itself leads to abjection; a w/hole
body has no need of dis/splay, dis/comfort; it's there inhabited, sutured,
one with inhabitation and self, powerful, commanding, desiring, desired.
The body tending towards discussion is already embedded in a futile
attempt to construct existence out of shifters, pronouns; the discussed
body is already a crude form of empathetic magic, which never works but
which constantly requires both sacrifice and repetition. Then one reads
it, the same, the differentiated, as autobiography; what is being
described adheres to, seems to adhere to, the events of the day, those
contortions or fits (fitts) of the writer, and thus replete with projec-
tion; this holds as well for fictional characters, but everyone recognizes
that avatars at least have no history. The avatar is intermediary/sluice
between clarified object and smeared self; its skin labors skin in one
very singular direction, that is, from an acceptable exterior distance -
but its skin labors space within or close to within. Within what? The
prims fall away, replaced by space which mirrors, maps external space, all
the way to the ends of the game, game-space, or beyond; mirrors, by asso-
ciation, space itself in the real, which is already virtual, the closer
one approaches quantum or fundamental particle levels. In this very real
sense it is the avatar which is real, and our selves, bodies, our organic
existence, which is virtual, dependent among other things on an Aristotel-
ian logic that holds only on _this_ level in the holarchy, among others.
For the law of distribution, so important in the application of classical
logic to the world, breaks down in favor of the gestural, once the logic
is examined closely, once appearance and the reading of the world, such as
it is, virtual-real, is foregrounded. We defend ourselves against this
through a whole phenomenology of pain and suffering, as if death consti-
tutes the undeniable presence of the material world. That this isn't the
case is clear, not by considering death itself virtual, but by recognizing
death as the termination of processes in the middle-zone, in the middle-
way - and processes them- selves, are by virtual of the ineluctable ontol-
ogy of time, virtual in their constituation.

In lieu, place, virtual or real, of this, I speak like a madman, like a
hungry ghost, already a contradiction, since what would fulfill a ghost,
hungry or not, except an internal transform among ghost-organs, ghost-
perceptions, ghost-epistemologies? Madness always carries the tinge of the
virtual with it, and thereupon the real, just as what one considers the
real in everyday life, appears as a dream, false, masquerade, sham, fac-
ade, theater and theatrical performance, all of which is true, recognized
in every movement or body-speech of an avatar, in one or another world,
more real than virtual, as ours is more virtual than real. To write of an
object: "Two modes: Well, I demonstrate (x); well, I demonstrate (myself).
The first compresses, contains, confuses the object" - is to write of
oneself writing of an object; this is elementary. And it is also elemen-
tary to realize that "writing of oneself writing of an object" is an
aporia, useless, exhausting, falsely-recursive; one might as well stop
there and recognize that the smear (stutter, cough, text, pause, punctua-
tion, page or screen) is behind, within, inherent in, every utterance
whatsoever. The psychoanalytical loss of object or good object or bad
object is founded on no object at all - none, but food in the eyes of the
hungry ghost, or the hungry ghost in the eyes of its prey. Nothing is
simple, everything melds within the hallucinatory, and rational action is
the apparent ability to 'freeze' those moments, as if they endured beyond
the momentary glance or description.

Just something to throw in the air - something I don't really feel is true =
to my own sensibilities (but worthwhile asking):

If blogging is so popular, and can reach so many diverse peoples in so many=
 diverse countries, then why do we continue to promote the arts via such ou=
tmoded (devil's advocation here...) attempts of distribution as chapbooks, =
books, monographs, journals, etc? If we're not in it for the money, then wh=
at is it for if we're so gung-ho about print publishing? I can see somethin=
g akin to vanity or prestige or status...

I hope this riles the masses!

Don't Miss the Historic Rally and March on Sunday in Washington, DC

=20

 This Sunday, June
10, join the US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, United for Peace
and Justice, and more than 300 other endorsing
organizations for a historic national mobilization in Washington, DC
to protest 40 years of Israel's
illegal military occupation of the Palestinian West Bank, Gaza Strip, and E=
ast Jerusalem, and the Syrian Golan Heights.=20



Be a part of this unprecedented global day of action
taking place in two dozen countries around the world and help us deliver a =
loud
and clear message:  It is time to end U.S. military,
economic and political support of the Israeli Occupation!



Now is
the time to call all your friends and family, forward this email to everyon=
e in
your address book, and invite them to join you for these historic events!



At 2PM on Sunday, thousands of people will gather at the West Lawn of the C=
apitol for a
rally.  We're excited about the amazing
line-up of speakers, performers, and emcees for the rally.  For an updated =
list, click here. =20



The current weather forecast is calling for a high of 83 degrees and sunny =
with a 10% chance
of precipitation.



For those who are coming from out of town, please be aware
that Washington, DC in June can get very hot and very humid.  Please bring =
plenty of water and food to keep you hydrated and nourished, as well as sun=
glasses, sunscreen, and a hat to
protect yourself against the sun. =20



Do not
drive to the Capitol?take the metro train and get off at Union
Station on the Red Line or Capitol
South on the Orange/Blue Lines.



We have secured a permit for this rally and we are working
in close coordination with the appropriate agencies to ensure the safety of=
 all
people attending this demonstration.  We
will also have volunteer security and legal observer teams, as well as
professional medical teams -on hand throughout the day.



Please be aware that there is a small counter-protest that
will be taking place a few blocks away. We ask all participants to refrain =
from
engaging with counter-protesters or provocateurs either physically or
verbally.  For additional important
suggestions for the rally, please read the important memo to
participants in the June 10th mobilization.



Below is a map of the West Lawn of the Capitol to orient
you.

=20



Following the rally, at 4PM we will march from the Capitol
to the Washington
 Monument, not far from
the White House.  We have an agreed-upon
march route with the Metropolitan Police Department, which will take us
southwest on Maryland Ave., west on Independence Ave., and north on 15th
St. NW to end at the northeast corner of the Washington Monument.  Please b=
e advised that this is a new march route from original planned
march route.  Below is a map of Sunday's
march route.









We're anticipating that the march will last until 6:00PM.  At 7:30PM, there=
 will be an amazing night of
cultural entertainment at the National City Christian Church at 5 Thomas Ci=
rcle NW, about one mile from
the end point of the march.\  The cultural evening spotlights the hip-hop s=
tylings of the Arab Summit, featuring Omar Offendum of the
NOMADS, Excentrik, The Narcycist, and The Iron Sheik; poetry readings from =
We Begin Here: Poems for Palestine and
Lebanon by Sarah Browning, Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz, Richard Schaaf, and

Subject:      did Andrews say "romantic crap" at the Body panel last month?

I made a transcription of a section of Andrews' talk given at last
month's Language Poetry and the Body Panel, to clarify what I recently
posted on my blog
(http://minnesotan-ice.blogspot.com/2007/05/who-hates-charles-olson-loud
est.html#links).=20

my response turns out to have been addressed at a literary Fata Morgana,
based on Mark Weiss' comment
(http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=3Dind0705&L=3DPOETICS&P=3D=
R113
73&I=3D-3). on the recording I thought I would find Andrews ripping into
Olson, Black Mountain and everything they represent. but upon listening
to the audio, I don't find anything that sounds like derision and
disrespect for earlier American schools, as mentioned by Weiss. was the
"romantic crap" jab made after they shut the recorder off?

listening to the audio, I found the panelists to be very cogent (except
when they were trying not to be, e.g., Steve Benson) and not at all
hot-headed in their presentations.

Bruce Andrews' text, as I have transcribed it below, strikes me as
another handy description of Language writing and what it wants from us
(beyond the more oblique interpretation: "Take me to your leader").

[transcript follows]

----

A standard rap would be [the body in L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE  =
writing] is the
territory for an oxymoron. Instead of a plenipotentiary of the body,
L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE writing gets staged as its enemy, as a =
disembodied kind
of writing practice, especially in contrast to the other sorts of poetry
present at its creation in the 1970s and since.

So, is the criticism legit? Did the contrasting poetries of the era or
even now do a better job of putting the body into the foreground?

Short summary of an answer: only if we're talking about the body of the
author, which wasn't something this experimental writing paid much
attention to. While most immediately it seemed to evolve from the more
drastic compositional methods of the so-called New American Poetry, at
the same time as it resisted what has proved to be such an intoxicant,
the author-centered romanticism of that tradition, whether Black
Mountain or Beat or New York School.

If by "body" you mean the preening display or performance of the
author's character, then L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE  writing implied =
a
disembodiment; it took a pass on most of that. Also it skirted many
familiar routes to that destination: the anecdotal story-telling mode of
even the smallest scaled versions of narrative, the declamatory or
propagandizing mode of direct political talk, the individualizing voice
of the precious poet, the lyric expressiveness of the author's subject
and its typically PUSHY MALE STEREOTYPED MODE, and the trappings or
upholstery of "poetry" as a genre that set up pretty coercive
expectations about that expressiveness.

So-called L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE writing also neglected to divert =
attention to
the representation to bodies outside writing. It signalled a neglect of
depictions of landscape, of symbolism and figuration, and illusions of
depth or spirit, of descriptive, novelistic stuff, of continuities of
experience, realistically unveiled.

And by skirting narrative -- as well as normal and normative style and
grammar -- it disabled some of that harnessed outward pull by creating a
much less single-mindedly directive surface and a much more disjunctive
texture, typically criticized as a compulsive attraction toward non
sequitur.

Much appreciated.
And I hope that we will always be friends,
and that's more important than the other stuff,
and maybe we will have an argument in the future,
but this one sure turned out well.

ah language poetry. is there anything about language poetry that cannot be
repeated? i love the language poets as much as anyone, but the criticism
written on them sometimes seems to sound like the press release for the
latest vaporware ("language poetry will change the way you inhabit the
world.")

i call languge poetry a negative theology of meaning in an upcoming essay,
and indeed, most of the discussion of the art, including Andrews' here, is
obsessed with this kind of "language poetry is not" (which devolves, with
loaded terms like preening, precious, etc. etc., into "language poetry
does not suck.")

i think the real problem with LP, and again, this is more praise than
criticism, is that it's never really dealt with its negative theology.
it's been content to enact certain textual rituals (let's be frank -- in
the end times of LP -- say Lyn Heijinian comes close -- one instantiation
is as good as another -- forgotten as soon as read, forgotten while being
read).

it's that ritual aspect, bells and smells, that i think people react to
both negatively and positively in the stuff. i think LP gives some people
space. i think there is probably a correlation between doing yoga and
liking LP. i think a lot of things.

ron called tom mandel a language poet recently, but then he's more
interested in poetry-as-sociology than poetry-as-poetry.

Simon,

Given the political intent of language poetry, I don't understand your
comment that Mandel is "more interested in poetry-as-sociology than
poetry-as-poetry." Or, maybe it's the implicit characterization of
language poetry as "poetry-as-poetry" I don't get. I can see where folks
might be inclined to draw a split, but I don't see how the history of
langpo could justify the assertion.

Narrative and Marriage to Language


My first narrative video in a long time:
http://odysseyart.ning.com/video/video/show?id=685033:Video:2078 (easy)
large version http://www.asondheim.org/spaceandthecity.mp4 (60 meg)

My text of marriage to language:

I don't understand what you're saying.
Perhaps I'm not hearing you correctly. Or perhaps I'm hearing you
correctly but don't understand the words you're using. Perhaps I'm not
sure you're speaking in language, you're using words. Perhaps I understand
what you're saying, but don't understand why or wherefore you're saying it.
Perhaps I'm not hearing you clearly.

I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Perhaps you're not speaking clearly. Perhaps I think you are making an
effort to say something, making an effort at speech, making an effort at
language. Perhaps I'm projecting on to you, that you are attempting to say
something. Perhaps I'm indicating that I don't understand your effort, or
that your effort is to no avail.

I don't understand the meaning carried by the words.
Perhaps I understand the words, but don't understand their overall
meaning. Perhaps I ascribe to a theory that words carry meaning, that is,
they do not mean, but they bear meaning, that is, that meaning is borne.
Perhaps the meaning carried by the words is obscure to me, perhaps it
requires knowledge I do not possess, and perhaps never have possessed.

I don't understand the words' meaning.
Perhaps I understand you are speaking words, but I don't understand their
meaning or the meaning they carry. Perhaps I am confused and understand
the words, but meaning is lost to me. Perhaps I am exhausted and meaning
has disappeared, perhaps I am inordinately depressed, and meaning has
decathected. Perhaps words, for me, are no longer invested with meaning,
or no longer carry meaning.

I don't understand the words.
Perhaps I don't understand anything you're saying. Perhaps I'm not sure
you're speaking words, perhaps you are speaking gibberish or nonsense
syllables or random phonemes. Perhaps I understand the words, but not in
the way you are using them. Perhaps I don't understand the language,
perhaps a new or different language, to which the words belong, from which
they originate, within which they make sense or carry meaning.

I don't understand your words.
Perhaps I understand the words but I don't understand your words. Perhaps
I don't understand what you mean with these words, what meaning you want
these words to carry. Perhaps your use of these words is unclear or their
meaning in combination is unclear, but the words, one by one, are clear.
Perhaps I don't understand the drift of your words, the sense of them.

I don't understand you.
Perhaps I understand your words and I understand their meaning and the
meaning you want the words to carry, but I don't understand why you're
saying these words, what is your motive, what you may be trying to tell
me. Perhaps I don't understand your words or anything about you, you are
not a thing to me, but you are not communicating any more than a thing, an
inert object, would communicate. Perhaps I understand nothing except that
I must reply to you, that it appears as if the words have meaning for you,
and both their meaning and you are lost to me. Perhaps I have never
understood you, and these words have clarified that for me, that I have
been living a life thinking I have known you, perhaps have known you well,
and in fact I have not known you at all, perhaps it has been a mistake
thinking I have known you.

I can't make sense of what you're saying.
Perhaps the words make no sense to me. Perhaps I do not recognize them as
words. perhaps I do not recognize your speech as motivated towards a goal
or object or orientation I might well understand. Perhaps I recognize your
phonemes and your syllable, but you are speaking nonsense or appear to be
speaking nonsense. Perhaps I think it is you who are senseless, perhaps I
think it is myself who suffers a fundamental lack, who cannot comprehend
what you are saying, no matter how many times you say it, and with what
force. Perhaps I do not know to whom you are speaking, who is the
recipient of your speech, perhaps it is not me at all. Perhaps you can't
make sense of this, of what I am saying to you. Perhaps I am speechless,
perhaps my words have dropped their meaning, lost their meaning, and are
carrying, here, in this very place, nothing but cries and whispers.

Hi all,

As the last days of Anselm Berrigan's time as artistic director of the
Poetry Project approach, and following Brendan Lorber's reflective intervie=
w
with Anselm in the most recent Poetry Project Newsletter, I thought I'd go
back to beginning, so to speak.

In Boog City 10, from October 2003, columnist Greg Fuchs interviewed the
then incoming artistic director on the eve of the project=B9s new season. The
piece includes some great Fuchs photographs of, and a poem by, Berrigan.

Also inside the issue are:

--Small press editor Jane Sprague on Albert Flynn DeSilver=B9s The Owl Press

Please reply to this with your email address to receive a pdf of this issue
and if you'd like to receive a free pdf subscription to Boog City please
note that.

 Naropa SWP bound graduate student/poet researching poetic communities
looking for a place to stay while in Boulder. Mature, responsible, quiet,
 will be gone all day in archives and lectures. I just need a place to stay
 and eat (will provide my own food) and am happy to pay. If you or someone
 you know knows about someone pref. close to the Naropa campus (but at this
 point, I'm looking anywhere) who's looking to rent out a room, please
 backchannel me.

Many thanks,

        Dear David-Baptiste,
       =20
        Yesterday, Sen. Schumer sent an urgent note=97which is included bel=
ow=97saying we needed a grassroots uprising to convince President Bush not =
to veto the lifesaving Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.
       =20
        The response was absolutely amazing.  And good thing too.
       =20
        President Bush's veto may come as early as Monday morning.  We need=
 as many signatures as possible by then.  Won't you please sign now?
       =20
        The president and his right wing ideologues are citing a promising =
new scientific study showing it MAY be possible to derive the most promisin=
g types of stem cells without using embryos.  This, despite the fact that t=
he very scientists who made this discovery have said it is important we con=
tinue to pursue all avenues of stem cell research.
       =20
        Sen. Tom Harkin, a chief sponsor of the bill, said it best: "It is =
time to take the shackles off of our federal researchers."
       =20
        Once again, Bush is cherry picking the science to the detriment of =
us all.  So, please, if you haven't signed the DSCC's petition, do so now. =
 We need all of the support we can get.
       =20
        Here is Sen. Schumer=92s message below.
       =20
        Sincerely,
        J.B. Poersch

                                George Bush is about to stubbornly deny the=
 will of the American people once again.
                               =20
                                This week, the House will pass a bill to li=
ft the arbitrary and damaging restrictions on federal funding for embryonic=
 stem cell research that President Bush put in place in 2001.  Two months a=
go, the Senate passed a similar bill.
                               =20
                                But George Bush is threatening a veto in de=
fiance of almost every congressional Democrat, many Republicans and the ove=
rwhelming majority of the American people. =20
                               =20
                                It's not science or facts driving Bush's de=
cision.  It is pure pandering to his radical right-wing base.  The upshot i=
s that millions who suffer from Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and diabetes will =
once again have their hopes dashed.=20
                               =20
                                                                 We can't s=
tand by and let this happen.  George Bush is preventing the development of =
treatments and cures for some of the worst diseases for no other reason tha=
n politics.  That is unconscionable.
                               =20
                                With the veto coming as early as Monday, we=
 must hurry and send our message to George Bush right now.

                                It'll come as no surprise that Bush and the=
 small band of Republicans in Congress who are providing enough votes to pr=
event a veto-proof majority are relying on pseudoscience and outright lies =
to defend their position.
                               =20
                                They tell us that other types of stem cells=
 have just as much potential as embryonic stem cells.  They claim that embr=
yonic stem cell therapies are dangerous and always cause tumors in mice.  N=
one of it is true.
                               =20
                                The country's top scientists believe embryo=
nic stem cells have the most potential to find safe, effective cures.  And =
the American people are right there with them.  Surveys consistently find t=
hat two-third to three quarters of people support expanding this research.
                                Even the scientists working on the most rec=
ent stem cell breakthrough support passage of the current bill.  As one of =
the scientist involved in the recent development said: "A human is not a mo=
use, so a lot more work has to be done."
                               =20
                                                                 It is time=

... these are the poems Stephen Vincent has been preparing to write his

At long last is Walking Theory, Stephen Vincent=B9s observant, large-hearted
poems bundled into book form, engaging architecture, people on the move, th=
e
seasons and other transience, the talk that binds the day: Goodbye,
rhetoric, the desperate,/what can the poem do, walking, step-by-step:/
witness, suffer, hope. Urbane and companionable, rare virtues flaunted here=

curbside delight.  Bill Berkson

Stephen Vincent's work here preserves and enhances the ancient association
of the foot as measure of the poetic line. In Walking Theory measure become=

metaphor:  =B3...foot ever to the ground, image by image, /thought by thought=

he moves through the days, from the grief-stricken rhythms of the opening
section of elegies to the more expansive tours of the San Francisco
neighborhoods where he lives and works.  Vincent celebrates the beauty of
these familiar landscapes, as well as strange, unexpected and sometimes
mundane details. In a wonderful pun that arises in the midst of the naming
of spring flowers, =B3the dotted eye=B2 suggests the I of linguistic convention
as the seeing, moving body=B9s eye transformed by language.    Beverly Dahlen

No -- was referring to Ron Silliman (in particular, SoQ/PA and related
categories, which seem more sociological although correlated with
aesthetics).

The claim that langpo was "about" politics -- well, it has certaintly been
associated in the critical literature, but I don't see that holding up,
except in as much as making people better is a political act (it seems de
rigeur to say that everything is political, but most among people whose
lives are least touched by actual politics.)

So, say Bernstein's emphasis (granted, in his essays) on discovering modes
of writing that resist commodification is...non-political? ...an after
effect of evaluation? ...a failure? ...what?

here are some short excerpts from performances and presentations at the 2007
epoetry conference held recently in paris:
http://lucdall.free.fr/epoetry2007 . the videos stream in, but the
connection is a bit slow, so after you click a vid, minimize it and let it
load for a while before starting it.

it was a terrific event. the mornings and afternoons were spent at the u of
paris attending lectures and panel discussions by artists and scholars; the
evenings happened off campus in paris at venues for performance and
presentations. the first evening, at Le Divan du Monde, was devoted to
performances; the second evening, at Le Point Ephémère, concerned
interactive work; and the third evening, at Le Cube, concerned Web work.

the evenings were well attended not only by people from the conference but
by parisians. epoetry, net art, and media arts more generally are very
active in the city of light.

many thanks to philippe bootz, patrick burgaud, and loss glazier for their
excellent organization of this international event.

 …every writer has a life, and every text is a development in any committed writer’s life, no? Every life finds, with the infinite, finishing schools off with that last draught. Even texts scour pill-green leaflet cars. Now he has to clean out this pipe. A commission with God as my co-pilot, Christ riding shotgun, blasts a sour morning all over the hairy walls, understand? Pudding and catsup and pudding and ketchup: I’m playing run abreast with me, cool air split by my chest sweating tenders from antiquity, in utero. That’s all we are. Then there’s some limit beyond which glass is butted against, the bitter levees holding the bigger river furl’d and unanswerable. Baptists sit in protest of a censure from embalming. Have I already made dark that prophet’s diction, listened through by grails, by onyx, by aspiration? I persimmon. An intelligent design would take into account no knowledge of its utility. He spent the long cold winter on a pair of swimming trunks, and threw away
 the receipt.

After having just attended the e poetry festival in Paris, I thought
this might be of interest to the list. I've watched the Digital Art
Weeks develop over the last two years and this year's festival looks
very interesting, especially the keynote by Joseph Weizenbaum.

mandel's work presents an interesting case: those early books like Ency and
Ready to Go are as constructivist or syntactically disjunctive as anything
else from the moment, while the books of and since the 1990s take on at
times a more obviously personal, reflective and even mediatative tone. you
can even see this dynamic playing out in tom's latest book from atelos, To
the Cognoscenti, whose long/serial title poem is filled with perceptual
torsions and whose other long serial poem, "Cheshbon Ha-nefesh," is based on
the jewish ritual of the accounting of the soul and thus is highly personal
and reflective.

in terms of poetry as social formation, mandel without question fits the
bill due to his timely presence and involvement in the bay area scene
beginning in the 1970s. if his work is exceptional, one must decide whether
it's the exception that proves or breaks the rules.

simon, going back into this thread a bit -- could you tell us a bit more
about your thesis on langpo and negative theology? are there parallels at
all in the attempts, beginning in the 1990s as far as i can tell, to bring
derrida and deconstruction under the banner of negative theology? because
while i certainly can see negativity at work in some of the critical
discourse surrounding langpo, a negative theology must posit some kind of
god one is supposed to reach or know through the negativity. and i'm having
a hard time conceiving what would the characteristics be of langpo's god.

many thanks,
tom orange

Film, the first Digital Medium


It was with amazement that early audiences watching the Lumiere lumines-
cent train heading towards the camera immediately grasped the fictional
and technological nature of the event. It's been postulated that neither
the persistence of vision nor the saccadic movements of the eyes had yet
been developed to any great degree. As a result, what the audience
witnessed was actually a series of stutters or spurts; it was impossible
for them to reconstruct the analogic experience from these few, far
between, and pitiful photographic images. What an error on the part of the
producers, who expected an overwhelming experience! Through the next
several years, men and women developed the illusion of projected motion -
with children, the learning curve was considerably shorter, given their
embrace of anything new and remote from the already decadent culture of
their parents. There was a curious hiatus between the Lumiere and further
experimentation with audience, during which the showmen attempted the
impossible - an awkward unraveling of the filmstock itself, a transparent
ribbon woven and passed among the motion picture audience. Since the film
was now moving, albeit without projection and the maltese-cross way of
holding each image for a split-second in the frame, the viewers of the
film were strangely satisfied. This all changed, perhaps for the better,
within a few months, when the projects began their clacking once again,
and the houses of vaudeville were filled with the melodrama and hijinks of
gardeners, factory workers, and attempts to reach the moon. (A surviving
specimen from the hiatus, not suitable for children (what were they think-
ing!) - http://www.asondheim.org/etched.jpg ).

[from today's NY TIMES]

Richard Rorty, Philosopher, Dies at 75


By PATRICIA COHEN
Published: June 11, 2007
Richard Rorty, whose inventive work on philosophy, politics, literary theory
and more made him one of the worldâ€™s most influential contemporary thinkers,
died Friday in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 75.

The cause was complications from pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Mary Varney
Rorty.

Raised in a home where â€œThe Case for Leon Trotskyâ€ was viewed with the same
reverence as the Bible might be elsewhere, Mr. Rorty pondered the nature of
reality as well as its everyday struggles. â€œAt 12, I knew that the point of
being human was to spend oneâ€™s life fighting social injustice,â€ he wrote in
an autobiographical sketch.

Russell A. Berman, the chairman of the Department of Comparative Literature at
Stanford University, who worked with Mr. Rorty for more than a decade, said,
â€œHe rescued philosophy from its analytic constraintsâ€ and returned it â€œto
core concerns of how we as a people, a country and humanity live in a political
community.â€

Mr. Rortyâ€™s enormous body of work, which ranged from academic tomes to
magazine and newspaper articles, provoked fervent praise, hostility and
confusion. But no matter what even his severest critics thought of it, they
could not ignore it. When his 1979 book â€œPhilosophy and the Mirror of
Natureâ€ came out, it upended conventional views about the very purpose and
goals of philosophy. The widespread notion that the philosopherâ€™s primary
duty was to figure out what we can and cannot know was poppycock, Mr. Rorty
argued. Human beings should focus on what they do to cope with daily life and
not on what they discover by theorizing.

To accomplish this, he relied primarily on the only authentic American
philosophy, pragmatism, which was developed by John Dewey, Charles Peirce,
William James and others more than 100 years ago. â€œThere is no basis for
deciding what counts as knowledge and truth other than what oneâ€™s peers will
let one get away with in the open exchange of claims, counterclaims and
reasons,â€ Mr. Rorty wrote. In other words, â€œtruth is not out there,â€
separate from our own beliefs and language. And those beliefs and words
evolved, just as opposable thumbs evolved, to help human beings â€œcope with
the environmentâ€ and â€œenable them to enjoy more pleasure and less pain.â€

Mr. Rorty drew on the works of Freud, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Quine
and others. Although he argued that â€œno area of culture, and no period of
history gets reality more right than any other,â€ he did maintain that a
liberal democratic society was by far the best because it was the only one that
permits competing beliefs to exist while also creating a public community.

His views were attacked by critics on the left and the right. The failure to
recognize scienceâ€™s particular powers to depict reality, Daniel Dennett
wrote, shows â€œflatfooted ignorance of the proven methods of scientific
truth-seeking and their power.â€

Simon Blackburn, a philosopher at Cambridge University, has written of Mr.
Rortyâ€™s â€œextraordinary gift for ducking and weaving and laying smoke.â€

Mr. Rorty was engaged with and amused by his critics. In a 1992
autobiographical essay, â€œTrotsky and the Wild Orchids,â€ he wrote that he
was considered to be one of the â€œsmirking intellectuals whose writings are
weakening the moral fiber of the youngâ€; â€œcynical and nihilisticâ€;
â€œcomplacentâ€; and â€œirresponsible.â€

Yet he confounded critics as well, by speaking up for patriotism, an academic
canon and the idea that one can make meaningful moral judgments.

His reason for writing the 1992 essay, he said, was to show how he came by his
particular views. Richard McKay Rorty was born in 1931 to James and Winifred
Rorty, anti-Stalinist lefties who let their home in Flatbrookville, N.J., a
small town on the Delaware river, be used as a hideout for wayward Trotskyites.
He describes himself as having â€œweird, snobbish, incommunicable interestsâ€
that as a boy led him to send congratulations to the newly named Dalai Lama, a
â€œfellow 8-year-old who had made good.â€

Later, orchids became another obsession, and his love of the outdoors continued
throughout his life. An avid birder for the last 30 years, Mr. Rorty liked to
â€œhead over to open spaces and walk around,â€ his wife Mary said yesterday
from their home in Palo Alto. His last bird sighting was of a condor at the
Grand Canyon in February. In addition to his wife, Mr. Rorty is survived by
three children and two grandchildren.

When he was 15, Mr. Rorty wrote, he â€œescaped from the bullies who regularly
beat me up on the playground of my high schoolâ€ to attend the Hutchins School
at the University of Chicago, a place A. J. Liebling described as the
â€œbiggest collection of juvenile neurotics since the Childrenâ€™s Crusade.â€

In his early career, at Wellesley and Princeton, he worked on analytic
philosophy, smack in the mainstream. As for the surrounding 1960s
counterculture, he said in a 2003 interview, â€œI smoked a little pot and let
my hair grow long,â€ but â€œI soon decided that the radical students who
wanted to trash the university were people with whom I would never have much
sympathy.â€

By the 1970s, it became clear that he did not have much sympathy for analytic
philosophy either, not to mention the entire Cartesian philosophical tradition
that held there was a world independent of thought.

Later frustrated by the narrowness of philosophy departments, he became a
professor of humanities at the University of Virginia in 1982, before joining
the comparative literature department at Stanford in 1998.

Over time, he became increasingly occupied by politics. In â€œAchieving Our
Countryâ€ in 1998, he despaired that the genuine social-democratic left that
helped shape the politics of the Democratic Party from 1910 through 1965 had
collapsed. In an interview, he said that since the â€™60s, the left â€œhas done
a lot for the rights of blacks, women and gays, but it never attempted to
develop a political position that might find the support of an electoral
majority.â€

In recent years, Mr. Rorty fiercely criticized the Bush administration, the
religious right, Congressional Democrats and anti-American intellectuals.
Though deeply pessimistic about the dangers of nuclear confrontation and the
gap between rich nations and poor, Mr. Rorty retained something of Deweyâ€™s
hopefulness about America. It is important, he said in 2003, to take pride
â€œin the heritage of figures like Jefferson, Lincoln, Wilson, Roosevelt,
Martin Luther King, and so on,â€ he said, and â€œto use this pride as a means
of generating sympathyâ€ for a countryâ€™s political aims.

Michael Hamburger   Distinguished translator and poet   Published: 11 June 2007

    Michael Peter Leopold Hamburger, poet and translator: born Berlin 22 March 1924; Assistant Lecturer in German, University College London 1952-55; Lecturer, then Reader, in German, Reading University 1955-64; FRSL 1972-86; OBE 1992; married 1951 Anne File (one son, two daughters); died Middleton, Suffolk 7 June 2007.

  With the death of Michael Hamburger, the English language takes leave of one of its most gifted and gently influential poets as well as the 20th-century's most distinguished and prolific translator of German poetry.
  Hamburger was born in 1924 into an upper-middle-class German-Jewish family in the Berlin district of Charlottenburg. Nine years later, the Nazi takeover put an end to the Weimar Republic and precipitated the family's emigration to Edinburgh and London. The later English translator of Goethe's poems once remarked on the "alacrity" with which he had come into the world on the very day, 22 March, of Goethe's death and famous cry for "more light". Such auguries of promise may be taken with a pinch of salt, and yet no account of the unity of Michael Hamburger's life and work could choose to ignore the almost uncanny coincidence of the date of his death with that of the German poet to whom he devoted so much of his lifework as a translator: Friedrich Hölderlin.
  Hamburger first encountered Hölderlin's verse while a pupil at Westminster School. By 16 he had already begun to translate this greatest of German poets, who was practically unknown to British readers at the time. His youthfully ambitious Poems of Hölderlin (1943) was the first of more than a hundred books Hamburger published. He continued to add to this for almost 70 years, with the most recent edition of Friedrich Hölderlin: poems and fragments appearing as recently as 2004 from Anvil Press, where he was lucky to find, in Peter Jay, a devoted editor and publisher of his poetry and translations.
  Hamburger recalled his astonishment at the interest generated in 1943 by the English publication of this difficult German in the middle of a war with Germany. An infantryman in training at Maidstone Barracks when the book came out, he was "benignly but firmly advised" by his company commander to represent his regiment by accepting the Poetry Society's invitation to give a Hölderlin talk and reading. According to Hamburger, the possibility of such "absurdities" in Britain was what made that war "worth fighting".
  Hölderlin in 1943 may have been a stranger in English, but it was only later, in what he called the "second phase" of his work as a translator, that Hamburger began to re-enact the essential tensions of a poetry as "far removed from any poetic convention obtaining either in German or English, in his lifetime or later". In so doing he "Hölderlinised" his English in much the same way as Hölderlin, in his own translations, had "Sophoclised" his German.
  It is possible that Hamburger wrote his own first poetry, too, under the spell of Hölderlin. The still very readable poem which opens his Collected Poems (1995) carries the almost lapidary title "Hölderlin. / Tübingen, December 1842". The earliest in his first collection Flowering Cactus (1950), "Hölderlin" was also his first published poem beyond the Westminster School magazine, contributed to an anthology of writing from Oxford and Cambridge while he was a student at Christ Church, Oxford. The poem adopts the despairing persona of Hölderlin's final years, when a state of "homelessness" followed what Hamburger would come to refer to as Hölderlin's "change of identity" (rather than madness). Asked whether the German poet had influenced his later verse, he would point only to "Hölderlin's breathing", a prerequisite of the arching syntax of his own impressive longer poems "Travelling", "In Suffolk", "Late" and "From a Diary of Non-Events".
  Hamburger's early identification with Hölderlin's plight, as well as his lifelong commitment to finding a "home" for the German poet in English, may have had roots in the vicissitudes of his own predicament - his "displacement" aged nine from one culture and language to another. Of his early impulse to translate from German (besides his decade-long preoccupations with Hölderlin and the German-Jewish poet Paul Celan, translations of work by Büchner, Rilke, Hofmannsthal, Trakl, Brecht, Eich, Huchel, Grass, Enzensberger and W.G. Sebald flowed from his pen), Hamburger wrote: "It is possible that I should never have started translating in my adolescence if that hadn't been a bridge to a culture lost to me in every other regard."
  Recollections of his early years are included in Hamburger's autobiographical work, A Mug's Game (1973, revised in 1991 as String of Beginnings). Until quite recently, however, he had thought that it was his father's political foresight that had hastened the family's sudden departure for Edinburgh, where, with the help of George Watson's College, Hamburger began his career as an "Englishman". But a group of German students researching the events of 1933 at the Charité, the university hospital in Berlin where his father held a prestigious chair in paediatric medicine, were able to inform him that his father had been dismissed in one of the first directives of the National Socialist authorities. The rest of the family followed - without his paternal grandmother, however, whose death at the hands of the Nazis he movingly commemorated in a poem about Adolf Eichmann ("In a Cold Season", 1961).
  Hamburger described the first year of his exile in Britain and in the English language as the equivalent of a child being thrown into water so that it may learn to swim. In all his descriptions of his early years he stressed the "gloomy" and "claustrophobic" quality of his Berlin childhood, where the flat was like a "prison". Life in Edinburgh, where he soon became a member of a boys' street-gang, was a "liberation" from an "introversion that had become morbid."
  The author of more than 20 volumes of poetry and many volumes of essays, whose seminal study of the tensions in European poetry, The Truth of Poetry (1969), the critic Michael Schmidt has ranked alongside William Empson's Seven Types of Ambiguity, Erich Auerbach's Mimesis or Donald Davies's Thomas Hardy and British Poetry, Hamburger often joked - not without rancour - about British reviewers of his poetry who would "brand" him "better known as a translator", or a "passionate breeder of rare apples" (which he was), or "a renowned German poet".
  The most powerful influences on his early poetry were not Hölderlin or Rilke, but Yeats and Eliot. Later on he came to agree with the critic G.S. Fraser, who, noting the cloying effect of the Irish poet's manner in Hamburger's verse, described it as "ghosting for the ghost of Yeats". As for Eliot, Hamburger eventually came to see that the great man's "doctrine of impersonality, taken too literally", had kept the aspirant poet in "a cage of decorous generalities" and that Eliot's notion of the "objective correlative", "improperly understood", had made him "distrust the data of his immediate experience".
  It was not until after his marriage to Anne File - the actress and poet Anne Beresford - and their move in 1955 to a house and large garden in Tilehurst, near Reading, that Hamburger began to set the close observation of his surroundings and sensual impressions against the dictates of taste and poetic convention. It was here that he discovered his appetite for what he called "the roughage of lived experience". It was here, too, that he began to write poems in which loyalty to the primacy of experience could admit the intense exchange of dream, memory and observation. If this was a slow and late development, it was later intensified by the family's move in 1976 from London to Suffolk, where Hamburger wrote poetry - often emerging from the work to which he applied himself in his garden and orchard until the day of his death - which will be remembered as his best.
  Reflecting on aging and dying in the month of his 80th birthday, he wrote of the peculiar freshness and urgency he sensed in the 17th-century George Herbert's poem "The Flower" ("And now in age I bud again./ After so many deaths I live and write"). It is to be hoped that poets centuries his junior will also derive sustenance and guidance from Hamburger's own poetry. His essay "The Survival of Poetry" defines an idea of contemporaneity that links him with Herbert and Hölderlin: "To a poet, language is all that it has ever been and is capable of becoming, all it has ever done or is capable of doing. In a sense, too, every poet who has ever written anywhere can be his or her contemporary in timelessness."

 free-range farming & factory farming turn out not to be so different,
sadly. often free-range just means hand fed rather than tube fed--check w/
the store you buy from--ask what they mean when they say free range. have
been educating myself on animal rights & it's beyond anything I imagined
what hens, pigs, cows, etc are subjected to so we can eat them easily.
it's beyond torture sometimes. this issue of animal rights is related to how
much grain there is left for hungry humans to eat & to global farming--eat
local products.

THE LAND/an art site, Inc., announces a call to artists for proposals of =
ideas that can be variably realized by partner artists working at a =
specific outdoor site (or sites) in New Mexico. The resulting works will =
be featured in a show titled SITE UNSEEN, to run from September 28, 2008 =
to October 19, 2008.

=20

Selected artists will be asked to contribute, with no detailed knowledge =
of the site(s), a score, plan or text, from which their on-site =
collaborator will devise a highly site-specific realization (or =
realizations). Ideas may be very specific or wide-open, and =
collaborations may range from blind to intensely cooperative. SITE =
UNSEEN will encourage artists to rethink traditional notions of =
collaboration and site-specificity, and will provide an opportunity for =
artists worldwide to be involved with THE LAND/an art site. Artists from =
outside the United States are especially encouraged to apply.

=20

The application DEADLINE is September 14, 2007.

Selection of idea proposals will be completed and artists notified by =
November 10, 2007.

THE LAND/an art site, working jointly with other New Mexico arts =
organizations, will review separate proposals from artists to work =
on-site, and selections will be completed by November 24, 2007.

Work on realizations will begin March 1, 2008.

=20

Applicants should send:

A proposal, artist's statement, resume, and examples/images on CD or any =
other appropriate support materials. Please include a SASE if support =
materials are to be returned.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:



THE WORD IN THE SEED:

An Experimental Workshop on Language and Writing-In-Place

First Session: Saturday, August 25, 11:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m.

Second Session (optional): Sunday, August 26, 10:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m.

THE LAND/an art site, Mountainair, NM



What do the nature of language and the "language of nature" reveal about =
each other? How can words be used as a bridge to the world outside the =
self? This intensive writing workshop, to be held at THE LAND/and art =
site in Mountainair, NM, will focus on coming to terms with the real, =
solid, immediate world through a close examination of its objects and a =
rigorous, critical approach to words. Drawing on ideas from linguistics =
and eco-poetics, and using exercises built around the powerful and =
seductive metaphors of land-as-language and text-as-landscape, we will =
search for ways to write this specific, wild place, rather than merely =
writing about it.



The Saturday session of THE WORD IN THE SEED is designed to be complete =
in itself. Sunday will be devoted to further exercises, readings and =
discussions. An extra fee for participation in Sunday's activities also =
covers Saturday evening and Sunday morning meals, and overnight camping =
at the site. SPACE IS LIMITED. Please contact THE LAND/an art site for =
more information and reservations.



J. A. Lee, the workshop facilitator, is the editor and publisher of =
Crane's Bill Books, and a freelance writer with more than twenty years' =
experience writing about literature and the arts for newspapers, =
magazines, and gallery publications. As a poet and fiction writer, he =
has given readings in Boston, MA, and Portland, OR, as well as in New =
Mexico. He curated the LAND AND LANGUAGE show at THE LAND/an art site in =
October 2005.



A NOTE ON THE SITE: The forty-acre site is a short drive from =
Mountainair, NM, in the foothills of the Manzano Mountains. There is a =
sheltered work area and latrine, but no running water or electricity. =
Participants should provide their own writing materials, and should =
dress appropriately for some walking and sunshine.



THE LAND/an art site, Inc., was established in 2000 as a nonprofit =
organization devoted to site-specific, environmentally low-impact, =
land-based art, and to educating the community about the environment =
through art. This fall THE LAND will mount its eighth invitational group =
exhibition.

My comment was about family farms, which in Wisconsin is usually no
more than a couple hundred head.  A factory farm can have upwards of
10,000 cows & as someone in the industry, there is a major difference
between how the animals are treated, let alone things like mad cow,
access to pasture, antibiotics, pesticides, water quality...

Family farms are all about local.  Support your local farmer's
markets & CSAs.  Or better yet, if you eat meat, develop a
relationship with a farm that does it's own processing & buy direct
from the farm.

Alan,

My impression was that when the audience saw the train rushing towards them
for the first time, they thought it was real and were panicked. The reverse
of what you are saying, I think. The awareness that what was on the screen
was  of the moviesa fiction was developed slowly, of course, never leaving
the seeing eye completely. That's where the power of the movies lie. Godard,
in "La Carabiniere," makes a joke out of it, the soldier on leave attacking
the hanging white sheet to see what is inside the bath tub where the buxom
lady is washing herself, and as a result falls all over himself pulling down
the sheet.

Interestingly, just a few days ago, I saw a Turkish movie where the sole
obsession of a sixteen year old kid in an Anatolian village is to create out
of clipped film fragments (clipped to rejoin the film strips when they snap
during the viewing, which they do all the time) a continuous motion. He
finally does so when he discovers the existence of the Maltese cross, that
the discontinuities it establishes is necessary to create the experience of
motion. But is that not so in everything, colors, familiarities, in
everything we na,e. The brain is biggest "fooler" of all.

When one watches early movies today, the jerky movements of the actors
perhaps gives us a hint of a more awesome reality:



            We Are All The Aristocrats
                "Every age has its doomed aristocrats."

Early movies progressed in jerky steps,
crowds, buses rushing in quick motion,
the eyes not moving fast enough to create the illusion of oneness.
If the pace of history quickened won't a greater number of people
die at a shorter time, does that mean, friends,
that our age is more cruel than others?
You are stupid, friend, it's the
celluloid that did not move fast enough
to create the whirr of smooth motion, it is
outside, the illusion, a sleigh of images, there is just so much
that a mind can take. A reel of Wall Street
the day of the first great crash, people milling around, faster than usual.
All scared crabs. We see history through
images as Robespierre saw it
in the sugar coated arguments of Ionian logic,
no no. Killing is the key,
the two acts of a four-act play,
its steel lips. I'm tired, Camille,
I'd like to rest my head on the soft billows
of your body.
That nonsense about, jumping out of the window
you see the whole history of your body before you reach the ground,
is it true?


Ciao,

Murat

I do use some language techniques like yoga, to disconnect the creative
impulse from desire, purpose, expectations... I find it to be very
rewarding, and glad to see their work (forgotten or remembered).


I suppose every poet has a favorite flavor or combination of flavors --

Deep Oakland Website Launchwww.deepoakland.orgMonday June 11, 2007Oakland, =
CA =97 Cities are more than the people, buildings and geographical areas th=
at define them. They are a nexus of connections creating active, vital comm=
unities. The size and shape of these connections may be invisible, even to =
the residents of a given city. And the location where one thing in the city=
 connects to another thing is often on the move. Points of connectivity may=
 be small, short-lived, visible only on a one-block radius. Connections mut=
ate. Yet the way a city =91looks=92 from the outside (media) can remain pro=
portionally static with the actual generation and re-generation of communit=
ies over time, the  transit and intersections of people, water, money, memo=
ry, ballots, animals, concrete, water, labor, food and information.Affiliat=
ed with neither the tourism nor better business bureaus, Deep Oakland seeks=
 to create a compendium of inter-linked images, text and sound that represe=
nt the complications and vitality of Oakland=92s current moment.This projec=
t is ongoing. As the website grows, we will continue to solicit and present=
 archival and current materials from a diverse range of Oakland writers, ar=
tists, community leaders and organizations, materials that engage or invest=
igate the city=92s ecology, economics, politics, development, history and t=
he arts.Our hope is that Deep Oakland will both serve as a location for con=
versation to begin, and will extend conversations already in progress, to t=
he point of critical mass where the interconnectivity of the activities of =
these disparate activists, artists and writers becomes visible and begins t=
o positively impact the Oakland community and the world at large.Featured w=

So, first off I am coming at this as a reader, looking at the phenomenal
(in the technical sense) experience of reading language poetry (after the
category of language poetry has been stripped of those works I think are
included for sociological reasons.)

To answer Ron Starr -- I think the essays and critical writings about
language poetry are definitely political, strongly political. But I just
don't think that politicization "infects" the writing itself. I should
also add that I find the tertiary prose surrounding the poetry to be
largely repetitive and a bit mechanically extended.

I haven't read the Bernstein essays, but if you meaning resisting
commodification as creating a poetry that cannot itself be commodified (as
opposed to being about some internal process), well that was a bit of a
disaster, no? Langpo twenty, thirty years on is the strongest brand name
in the "business" (mostly as a metonym.)

To answer Tom, I would say that reading langpo as a negative theology is
my way in, which has the advantage of not being a critical act that
itself is subject to the very same negativity of the poetry itself.

Langpo, from a diachronic perspective, is a utopian project, it believes
in justice, truth (but not Truth) as the forever-deferred, as (as Badiou
unfolds it) the number-that-is-not-a-number.

Here's just to randomly take from Hejinian, in Happily:

Perhaps there were three things, no one of which
  made sense of the other two
A sandwich, a wallet, and a giraffe

This just seems like a paradigmatic langpo moment (if a little more
readable than others, more memorable, more lined-up with ordinary brains.)
The superswervy logic of this little clip is just fantastic; "sense" is
present only in its absence.

Actually my post is a satire; none of it is true and of course you're
right about the Lumiere. A couple of things though - first, there's no
'persistence of vision' (in case people think otherwise); the reason
motion's perceived in cinema has to do with the way the eye processes
motion in the real world through saccadic movement, which, in effect,
transforms the real into a series of disparate pictures or frames - one
might say tht cinema predate the perception of the real as such. Second
point is the reason early films appear 'jerky' - they weren't to the
audience of the time, because the framerate of filming and the framerate
of projecting were both the result of hand-cranking; film speed, in other
words, was itself a trope of early cinema, entire malleable. Later a rate
of 16 fps was more or less established, but projectors quickly went to 18
fps thus 'speeding up' the early films, giving the perception of jerki-
ness,. The more one looks at early cinema, the more sophisticated it
appears, and the more complex. - Alan

hi simon,

i realize you don't have all your resources at hand, but maybe it would be
helpful if you could explain what you mean by "those works I think are
included [in the category of language poetry] for sociological reasons."
also, i'm not sure how the hejinian quote you offer, "'sense' is present
only in its absence" -- to me the sense of these lines is quite clear...

> Perhaps there were three things, no one of which
>   made sense of the other two
> A sandwich, a wallet, and a giraffe

...and moreover, it's not that "sense" is only present in its absence,
rather it simply won't be contained within a singular: "no one of which /
made sense of the other two" implies at least the possibility that two might
make sense of the third or all three. sense is potential, possible when
dependent upon multiples rather than singulars.

finally, you say your reading "has the advantage of not being a critical act
that
itself is subject to the very same negativity of the poetry itself," but
when you conclude that in the hejinian lines "'sense' is present only in its
absence" this seems like a critical act that is certainly heavily invested
in negativity of some kind -- how do you see this critical negativity of
your reading differing from that of the poetry itself?

thanks,
tom orange

An interesting issue, this question of how silent films appeared in their
original time. At first I thought to say 'their time', but their time is
also now.

It's a question I've wondered about also. Because in my work with animation
using Director and Shockwave, there's a similar issue. One may assign the
'movie' a framerate, at any moment. But, still, we often find that Shockwave
movies play quicker on faster machines. And this isn't simply a matter of
slower machines being incapable of playing at the assigned framerate; also,
fast machines seem to play in excess of the assigned framerate. So that it's
possible very fast machines may play way too fast.

The solution is to not rely on the automatic control of framerate built into
Director. One may take the matter into one's own hands, bypass the default
control structure, and set up a situation where slow machines may indeed
play slower than normal, but no matter how fast the machine, once it is fast
enough, it will not play too fast but, instead, at the assigned rate. This
is something I've done in all my Director work for the last few years so
that if the work makes it into the future, which of course is a moot point,
it will play at the speed I want it to.

Computation occurs in the interstices of time. Redraw in other insterstices
of time. And then there is sonic timing, which is a bit different. We note
that we very rarely hear sound slowed down or cut off even if the framerate
is visibly slow. There is always some sort of dance going on between the
computation, the visual redraw, and the play of sound, in computational
multimedia. One tries to write the code so that no matter how fast computers
become, the work will play at the assigned tempo.

I think video normally plays at 24 frames per second these days, does it
not? I try to set my Shockwave work to 30 or 32 frames per second when this
is possible. 24 frames per second often seems too slow in this sort of work.

I appreciate your posting Iain Galbraith's obit of Michael Hamburger.  I
also know Michael Hamburger mainly as one of the best translators of Celan
but also as the writer of a superb book about poetry, *The Truth of Poetry*
(1969) which contains hundreds of fascinating quotes and comments, from and
about modern writers, artists and critics, a highly individual selection
immensely useful in its own right that encapsulates a history and commentar=
y
concerning modern poetry that for me, in both literary and
literary/political acumen, has never been surpassed.. For over 35 years, th=
e
book has never been long out of my reach.

Even a very quick glance at the index reveals the range of poets and others=
,
from the major to the minor, from innumerable countries, that Hamburger
wrote about and quoted,  over 500 in this book of 354 pages:  Adorno,  Amis=
,
Arp,  Bartok,  Brecht, Baudelaire,  Benn,  Bly, Bonnefoy,  Bunting, Celan,
Chesterton, Connolly, Cid Corman, Crane, Creeley, Marlene Dietrich, Eluard
Fortini, Groddek, Guillen,  Ian Hamilton, Heissenbuttel, Hikmet. Ionesco,
Hughes, Jaccotet, James, Jandl,  Jarry, Jiminez, Klebnikov, Kafka, Kenner,
Langer, Leopardi, Lowell,  MacDiarmid, MacLeish, MacNeice,  Medawar, Merwin=
,
Mon,  Montale, Moore, Nietzche,  Charles Olson,  Orwell,  Pascal,  Paz,
Peguy,  Perse, Peyre, Poe, Ponge, Prada, Prevert, Raine,  Richards,  Riding=
,
Roethke,  Rosewicz,  Ryuichi, Sachs, Schickele,  Seferis, Snyder,  Stein,

My understanding has been that the retention of the image on the
retina , creating an overlap on the retina of one frame and the next,
is what creates the sense of continuous motion in film, and
incidentally the phenomenon that filmed wheels appear to turn
backwards. This was the standard explanation of the illusion of
motion in film. Has that changed?

Film was hand-cranked, but the cameramen attempted to do so at an
even, determined speed, usually 20 frames per second, which was also
the speed of projection. This steadiness of pace was one of the more
valued skills. Chase scenes were sometimes shot at more than 20
frames, then projected at 20, so that they appeared faster, to add to
the excitement. This is still done. After sound came in and silent
filming was relegated to amateur and specialized use, the standard of
now motorized projectors and cameras was 16 silent and 24 sound.
Theatrical projectors, in fact, ran only at 24. So silent films could
be projected too fast or too slow, and theatically only too fast.
Hence the jerky motion. I've seen silent films projected at 20. No
jerkiness. I've also seen fsilent films printed with the aid of a
strobe ro stretch 16 to 24. rapid subject motion and camera movement
tends to blur, creating a strobe effect. Not great, but better than
DW Griffith in quick time. The temple scenes in Intolerance, for
instance, are considerably less comic.

maybe I'm just thick, but most of the langpo I read (and enjoy) is
high-larious, and readable. I know that's not the point -- nevertheless,
on the ground I take it as latter-day Dada.

I'm not denying that the lines are sensical, that we can discuss what they
mean. I'm talking about what they mean. What is the sense of "sandwich,
wallet and giraffe" as a disjunctive union?

Hejinian implicitly claims that there is a sense to this peculiar group.
Whatever that sense is, she doesn't say. It's clear that it's nothing
ordinary, graspable (in the way, say, "vein, heart, artery" is).

Hejinian, if you take her normative content seriously (which move is I
think proscribed by some langpo critics because hey we're really talking
about a unitary subject making the statement here) -- is seeing sense
deferred, not non-existent.

I think your standards for "high-larity" and readablity are rather low!
The most I manage is a smile.

Yes, when we talk about the sequencing of
our narrative, we seem to be talking about making
a composite picture drawn from the narratives of
the many. There is no disputing the information
contained in THAT narrative. At 24 frames per--
what really matters is the quality of the information
we have about the information. And, always, our
own narraive is just beginning.

And then, there's my favorite Peter Greenaway quote:
"We shoot 24 frames per second, but we now know
that 60 frames per second would be much better. Human
guinea pigs who have experienced projection at 60
frames per second almost feel a sense of nause at the
sense of reality."

So Greenaway thinks it would be much better for his audience to barf.
It may be that his particular audience tends to barf when confronted
with "reality," by which I assume he means verisimilitude.

If I remember correctly (and there's no guarantee of that) the
cinemax stuff is shot at greater than 24 fps.

Hello All,

Digital Artifact is a new online magazine launched and sponsored by Artifact and edited and designed by a collective of writers and visual artists.  Our first issue investigates the ways in which the internet transforms narrative and language.

Check it out at:
http://www.digitalartifactmagazine.com/issue1


Digital Artifact Online Magazine

Digital Artifact Magazine interrogates narrative in contemporary culture
through fiction, criticism, experimental prose, or web-based audio-visual
work.  We're specifically interested in how the internet, digital culture,
global and non-Western literature, pop culture, eroticism, documentary,
philosophy, politics and war are creating hybrid texts and new forms of
narrative and literature.

Aryanil,

Yes, film is photography 24 times a second. I developed the concept of film
lumiere in an essay I wrote, "Eleven Septembers Later: Readings of Benjamin
Hollander's Vigilance, about two years ago. In "fiilm lumiere" what is seen
and what is heard decouple and move contrapuntally rather than harmonically
with each other and visual movement slows down to a state of photography.
That's what Godard is saying; reality is in the static thereness of the
photographic images which expand to the illusionary motion. My essay, as I
am usually prone to do, mixes a bunch of ideas together.

Ciao,

Murat

And the other inventor of cinema, Thomas Edison, in
his Black Maria theater, originally used a recording
and projection frame rate of 40fps.  How did he settle
on that?  I don't know, and i'm sure it's come down to
24fps because of the economics of making film.  But
maybe he was really paying attention!

Coincidentally, there is a verified brain wave
'timecode' of 40 cycles, which might be also a widely
disseminated falsehood for all i know. (Like the
'persistance of vision' theory of cinematic movement
as Alan points out).  This 40 cycles per second
background brain hum is supposedly, or theorized to be
a kind of basic reset and synchronization period for
various brain processes, presumably also sense
gathering.  Like Greenaway, i have heard that movies
shown at a 40fps frame rate are uncannily vivid and
appear vaguely three dimensional.

I understand that in the silent era there was less of
a standard than one might assume, and the films were
shot and shown at varying frame rates from 16 up to 22
fps before the advent of sync sound. Sync sound
(printed directly on the filmstrip) required more
standardization for various reasons probably, but i
think mostly because the ear can tell small
differences in pitch much better than the eye small
differences in motion.

The Godard quote also leaves out that cinema (not
video, but film) is also nothing 24 times a second
(because of the blanks between frames).  So it's
probably safer to say that cinema gives us on average
a half-truth once a second.

Another interesting point concerning framerate: it has to be OK with our
human 'framerate' or we get a bit ill.

The refresh rate of monitors is normally set somewhere between 60 and 75
refreshes per second, or Hz (cycles per second). Why not higher or a bit
lower?

I remember thinking that 100 would be nice so I set mine quite high. But I
found it gave me headaches (literally). I've been told that our vision and
nervous system is somewhere around 50 to 75 Hz (cycles per second).

Apparently, early on, the refresh rate of electric light was set quite high,
but it made people queasy or ill. Now the frequency of electricity is
normally 50-60 Hz, as you can see at
http://users.pandora.be/worldstandards/electricity.htm . I'm under the
impression that this is because it synchs nicely with our biology and
doesn't normally cause dis-ease.

was seeing Abel Gance's Napoleon with a full symphony orchestra. Scenes like
the French Assembly filmed with a swinging camera so it appeared like an
ocean in tumult, or those incredible panoramas of the aftermath of battle,
demonstrate the truism that it's not the technology that counts, but how
imaginatively it's used. In which matters, "progress" is a little difficult
to graph.

Hi all,
=20
Apologies for the non-Boog email.
=20
I've renewed my Mets Sunday plan for the 2007 season and I thought I'd see
if any of you might be interested in buying any tickets (and getting the
poetic mojo by sitting in the same place where Jim Behrle, Jordan Davis,
Jean-Paul Pecqueur, and Nathaniel Siegel have sat in years past). I've been
sitting in the same section for the past nine, now 10, years--mezzanine,
sec. 2 (behind home plate). I have two tickets for each game (prices below
are per pair), and they're under the overhang, so you don't get burned in
the sun or wet in the rain.
=20
If you're interested in buying any tickets (or know someone who is) you can
email me here. (Note that the Mets charge different prices depending upon
the opponents and the date, so you'll see, for example, that the Florida
Marlins=B9 game costs more than the Philadelphia Phillies=B9 one.)
=20
Hope this finds you well (and lets go Mets!)
=20
as ever,
David

Yeah, I know I'm six months behind on this, but...

A few of the comments here remind me of my experience with Indian English. I
know they're speaking English, but many of the stresses are on different
syllables. Sentences  seem to have a different inherent music than
Anglo-American English. I wish I knew if or how Hindi, etc., has altered
this *performance* of English (making Indian English one of several
Englishes). There have been many times when I had to ask someone to stop,
repeat and speak more slowly so I could understand them. Sometimes they just
roll their eyes at me as if to say: what's the matter with you, I am
speaking English, you know. And I do know, but my ears aren't tuned to their
rhythms of it. I thnk it's pretty cool. I like the sound of it. But am
irritated at myself for having a hard time of re-tuning my ears to what
sounds like a completely different metrical structure of the English
language though the vocabulary and syntax are mostly the same. (If you're
thinking of Apu on *The Simpsons,* don't. That's just an accent. )

Looks very cool, nice artwork, too; however due to the adult nature of some of the contents, the owners of the magazine/site should post with their notices about it that it's appropriate for ages 18 and over only.

Although I know some very mature 16 year olds, and 30 years olds who I wouldn't trust to water my cactus.

Nice new digital magazine though from some folks out in San Francisco.  I particularly liked  Sarah Fran Wisby's bio on the contributor's info. page.  Good luck with the new baby!

Try Glasgow some time. Glaswigians of course know that they're
incomprehensible, think it's funny, and try to be helpful to
foreigners (except maybe people from Edinburgh).

"Cinema is truth 24 times a second"--"Kino-Pravda" (Cine-Truth) as Vertov c=
alled his work, which during the late 1960's was given a great deal of spac=
e --via translations of texts, stills from films, commentaries, analyses--i=
n the pages of Cahiers du Cinema--and greatly affected Godard's thinking an=
d work at the time--"Pravda"--"truth" as propaganda--public relations--peda=
gogy in the discourses and disciplines of the new society--an aspect of cin=
ema and photography which is fascinating is that they are as much arts of d=
isappearance as appearance--"the cinema shows death at work" said Cocteau--=
the very action of the actor/documentaried persons--aging moment by moment =
"before one's very eyes"---frame by frame--in order for a film to "appear",=
 the people and things in it are shown in the process of their own disappea=
rance--the Neo-Realist films, for example, are "creating a new cinema in th=
e ruins of the old world"--the appearance of the new films documents the di=
sappearance of ruins as they become cleared away and the empty spaces turn =
into new structures of society, of habitation, of business, of culture--of =
the 'future" becoming the "present"--yet at the same time the Neo-Realist C=
inema is documenting its own disappearance--for as the ruins vanish before =
the onslaught of the new--Neo-Realism, a cinema of "living" non-actors film=
ed in real life settings--is "dying out" along with its vanishing subject m=
atter--in a few years it goes from being a living movement in cinema--to be=
coming an artefact of the cinema's past--a monument in the cemeteries-museu=
ms-archives of the "history of cinema"--a cinema of "real life"--becomes on=
e of ghosts--wandering in the ghost towns of their vanished cities--cities =
which had vanished in war--and in turn had been vanishing al the while they=
 were being filmed--the cinema--a film-- --as "document"--can be constructe=
d to create not simply "illusions"--but things like "proof of lack of evide=
nce"--using shadows, camera angles and a few edits--a person or persons sai=
d to be present at an event--and have witnesses claiming to have seen them-=
-can be shown with film to have "not been there"--something i tried long ag=
o at a very crude level with super 8 film was to take footage of an event a=
nd to gradually make a person be there who had not been there at all--but n=
ot to do this "suddenly" so to speak, but "gradually", within  the 24 frame=
s per second--that is, the person begins to appear at first in one frame in=
 24, then 2, then 3 and so forth--until finally they have "arrived" at bein=
g visible for 24 frames--for a second--one glimpses them--defintiely "there=
" where they were not--yet they have been slowly "getting there" all along-=
-and after their appearance, to make them vanish in the same way in reverse=
--24 fps, then 23, then 22 . . . a ghostliness emerges, then vanishes--"the=
 aesthetics of disappearance" becomes ever more sophisticated--with the int=
roduction of every new technological of visuality--in a world of ever more =
intense visual scrutinies--camouflaging--decoys--distractions--doubles--sim=
ulations--cloakings--create new arenas of struggle in the "image wars" of a=
ppearance/disappearance--with the appearance of each new form of visual tec=
hnology--begins the disappeancce not only of previous technologies' present=
ations of appearances--but also a change in the ways in which humans see th=
e immediate world they live in--since the camera, then the film camera, the=
n the video, the satlite camera, the mobile camera--the hand held--the vide=
o in a watch--have moved into the human sphere of being reference points of=
 visuality outside the limits of the eyes--become used for the things which=
 are perceived by huamn visuality--humans have learned to adapt to "seeing"=
 in  ways they actually physically cannot--and i mean they are capble of do=
ing this without the technological equipment--by "projecting" as it were--t=
he vision they are being trained to think of as "real" via digital cameras,=
 imagery on screens----by projecting this onto the world they are moving in=
--the person then begins to see not what is there in the sense they saw via=
 reference too the "old school" photos and videos, films--but something "ne=
w"--in which what one is aware of has been shifted from one mode of seeing =
and awareness to another--ever since the first photos, people became aware =
via filmed images of things in the world they had not seen before--the came=
ra and film, video and digital image--give the sense that on is seeing more=
 than people did before, becuase on is being trained in how to see by these=
--meanwhile, as older methods of seeing begin to "die out"--the worlds they=
 saw, while still physically present, begin also to "die out" to human sigh=
t--with the advent of each new technology of vision, their occurs this cont=
inual "discovery", "rediscovery", "recovery" of the world--the streets, the=
 city--the countryside--people's faces--all these thing one had grown accus=
tomed to and thought one knew as dull and used up--suddenly become new agai=
n--and are noticed--recorded, commented upon--while al the while other worl=
ds present simulataneously "vanished before our eyes"--when Baudelaire wrot=
e "The Painter of Modern Life" which introduces Modrnism as a defined term-=
-he is writing of methods of visuality--of a painter--at the very time that=
 photgraphy is also beginning to be shall we say "developed"--paniting then=
 begins to introduce new forms of visuality--which become widely known via =
photography--influence photography--and influence human seeing on a daily b=
asis--the continual development of awareness of "new" appearnces as others =
"disappear" while remaining hidden in plain sight--leads to a contnual reco=
mmodification of the world of apperances--as each time it is perceived a di=
fferent way via a new technology of seeing--it becomes repackaged--and is "=
new" "all over again"--From the time since Baudlaire, walking in the city--=
and walking anywhere--as a means of perception related to the production of=
 images and texts is able to be continaully regenerated--not simply because=
 of the physical changes of cities--but also due to the changes in percepti=
on which persons develop in acordance with new technologies of seeing--An e=
ffect of this continual regeneration of a walking/perceiving/documenting/te=
xtuality is the production of the period "look" and "syle"--created not onl=
y by the architecture, clothing and machines, displays etc which are seen a=
nd recorded--but the way of looking particular tothattime which is the one =
most dominant--Yet a curious eeffect of this is that as much as a seeing it=
 creates a blindness also--into which disapper al those things which while =
present are not seen--or not present, can be made to appear by a manipulati=
on--before, during or after the fact--Studying imagery of the past decade o=
r so--one notices that what is presented as being "the streets" is often in=
distinguishable from what is shown on tv, in an ad, on a set for fashion fo=
tos--the eye, trained by these, going forth, finds them--and feels that it =
indeed is "seeing the real world"--becuase this is the world as it is being=
 shown to be--hence a good deal of "documenatry" "art" photography and"art"=
-- looks much the same and in turn much like --high fashion/high tech photo=
s, media images and other "art"--as though the world is increasingly the sa=
me--or--is it that the way of seeing it is increasingly the same?--both of =
these at once, moving at differeing speeds--in other words, a good deal of =
the discovery of the world all over again, is actually the growing recognit=
ion of it  by more and more people of what they have learned the world look=
s like through images--when they see the wold as it is shown to be--they fe=
el they are truly seeing it--reality, conforming to images of it, is seen i=
ndeed to be "real"--and anything not conforming to the "real" disappears--e=
ven though one may see it a hundred times a day--it is not there--"i never =
saw that before"--becasue the eyes are trained to recongize only certain wa=
ys of seeing, which create blanks, blind spots, white outs, in the visual f=
ield--patched over by what one is expecting to see--dominating the line of =
sight--"the blank and ruin we see in Nature is within our own eye" as emers=
on wrote--"the world as we see it is passing" remarked Paul of Tarsus, who =
himself underwent a form of photographic experience in order to "see the li=
ght"--as Saul of Tarsus being made blind on his way to murder Chritians, th=
e Roman envoy--now a "negative" plate-- has shown on him the Light of God--=
and when his eyesight is restored--he sees the world through new visual mea=
ns--a sight which as been "developed" in the "dark room" of his prison cell=
 and blindness--and now finds himself one of the Christians he had been sen=
t to destroy--in a sense, Saul has disappeared--vanished--during the photog=
raaphic experience of developing--and bcome Paul--with a new way of seeing =
the world installed in his eyes--"the world as we see it is passing"--again=
, the cinema as death at work in Cocteau's terms--yet everyday within one's=
 own yes--there is undergoing a process not only of death at work--but also=
 of forms of "developement" into new modes of seeing--which are constructed=
 interestingly in relation to blindness and disapperance--it is not always =
the world which is passing--but "as we see it" which is passing--one can pr=
actice a kind of method of attempting to learn to see in tthe opposoite dir=
ection in a sense--for example--to walk the same walk, or even really one b=
lock--over and over and over through time--in all sorts of light, weather, =
and to begin to become ware of how often on is seeing things one did not se=
e there before--no matter how many times one was n this same smal area--whe=
n one is using as reference other images, modes of perceptions--one is not =
in a sense actully "present" at one' own act of seeing--by continually retu=
rning to the same motif through time, one is gradualy being able to insert =
oneself into the present moment, to be present at one's present seeing with=
 less and less interference--(Cezanne's methods in this reagrd--)-the more =
this is done, the more things which are already there will appear--"as thou=
gh they were never there before"  "yet there all along"--hidden in plain si=
te/sight/cite(in my own work i persoanlly by making rubBEings and clay impr=
ession paitings, work a ta convergence among the senses, and exchange among=
 them--so that sight and touch become more involved with each other's actio=
ns--and the direct impression of the thing seen/felt--which is something ot=
her than a record of what it "looks like")iti s not only camera speeds and =
projection speeds which can be accelrated or slowed down, but the speeds wi=
th which one uses one's eyes--to slow the vision --to hold it--to repeat it=
--to move it more swiflty--or for for shorter durations--to think in terms =
of glimpses --seeing in glimspes--and then --moving to glances--to explorin=
g an endless array of wys of looking--by wlaking, by standing still, by loo=
iing sideways, upside down--by looking in the dark--by dim light--by bright=
 light--etc--as Olson wrote :  "polis/is eyes"(and i wd add hands, ears mou=
th, feet, nose--)in a sense wha tfilm brings one to realize is the extent t=
o which one's real eyes in a sense have become camera parts in a great many=
 ways--one has in a sense without becoming aware of it, been turned into a =
tourist of the sites of one's daily life--seeing it as it would appear in a=
 represenatation of it--and finding it to be 'real" as one is taking a tour=
 of it--"real" in the sense tha tit confroms to representations--and hence =
is worthy of discovery--this is what seems to be happening in many ways wit=
h Robert Smithson what interests me is working with the finding of one's ow=
n ways of the "artist' way of seeing", "the art of looking"--which may be w=
ithout any object--that is, the look, the method of looking, in itself, not=
 imprisoned in the object--becomes a method of na kind of guerilla existenc=
e of seeing, operating as it were "beind enemy lines" while "hidden in plai=
n site/sight/cite"yet the military metpahors are not the ones i want to sta=
nd by--these are only a reminder that the methods of vision always most in =
the advance--the adacnce guard so to speak--of course--as developed by the =
military--just as they then pass on to being developed by the companies man=
ufacturing and marketing the latest in cameras and so forth--and which in t=
urn becomes the latest wyas, modes a la mode, of seeing among huamns--so--t=
o work agasint the grain---is to use the sense of Smithson's "art of lookin=
g"--as a strating point--which in turn brings one back to Baudalire's "Pain=
ter of Modern Life"--in the streets--moving at high speeds-(he is NOT the f=
laneur, not this fellow!)---observing and finding his materials--a maxim fo=
und in Henry Miller long ago is:"What is not in the open streets is false, =
derived, that is to say literature."Yet is it--or --how--possible any longe=
r to say this?One of the effects of the cinema , of photography, of the dig=
ital--is that precisely one is confronted with vanished streets before one'=
s  eyes and to one's touch and in one's hearing--The journey to the underwo=
rld turns into the journey into the space before one--visually, phsyically,=
 sonically--a vanished world alive in plain site/sight/cite--"as real as da=
y"--yet as though hidden in darkness--a buried world--yet alive--which one =
uncovers . . . one of those catch phrase slogans which which sounds "true" =
until one thinks about it for a few seconds--as pointed out, half the time =
of that second is darkness--yet further than that, cinema can be lies 24 ti=
mes a second--or a shuffling of "truth" and "lies" 24 times a second--> Dat=

I'm curious where you saw this - I saw it at a premiere in the 80s in Los
Angeles; Coppola was conducting. It was an overwhelming experience.

Thanks, Alan

Stardust


Avatar learns to manipulate ghost shape, whip it around her against the
setting sun, moving it lasso-style, erupt ghost shape against rising
sun, learning the furious manipulation. Avatar listens to old sleazy
neurotic soundtrack as Master talks about his films and their relation
to pornography. The interview is wrong-headed, terrible, embarrassing,
my only excuse is that it was recorded at a very very low point of my
life; I wasn't sure I'd pull through. But there's only three minutes
here, no reason to worry, lots of disgust.

One of my more surreal experiences in Glasgow was talking to some Glaswegians who I could understand fairly well, but who had trouble understanding my American accent.  You never think you're incomprehensible until you start talking to other people.

I'd hestiate to say that AC current frequencies made
much perceptual difference with early lighting b/c
incandescent light does not flicker, it glows.

Florescent light however, does flicker, though i don't
think flicker itself makes something a digital medium.
(But then Alan's first post on the thread *was*
satiric.) I've heard that flicker contributes in a big
way to some ocular-headache-causing interaction
between computer monitors and office lighting.

To me what's interesting about all this is that
cinematic motion perception is a by-product of the
alternation of little something and a little nothing,
at small intervals.  And that tuning the variation of
those intervals around certain human electrical
rhythms invokes high level physiologic and perceptual
effects out of which prosodies, play, information and
hoax are built, which all get folded into the evolving
meaning of "to see."

I would love to observe a device that would vary the
frame rate without altering motion speed. I feel like
with that one would almost watch the brain seeing, the
way with some writing i feel i'm watching it read.

I love it that my dear colleague and my dear former student are having this
conversation.
Just to throw another idea into the pot, don't you recall watching a Mike
Leigh movie or two where he's used subtitles because most non-Brits can't
understand a cockney or Manchester accent or dialect.
    Here's a nice tale:  an Italian(Tuscan) friend visited SF many years ago
and went to North Beach.  Ma! said he, those are fake Italians.  We don't
even speak the same language.
I tried to explain that many emigrated from Southern Italy.  He said, forget
it, his mother was from a villa near Rome.  I tried to explain that some
simply lived in North Beach as Italians and over time developed a San
Francisco Italian.   See, he said, they are Not Real Italians.

Alan and Alison,
I saw it also - a wonderful experience with full symphony orchestra
and triple screen finale panorama - at Radio City Music Hall, New
York City.  Don't remember who conducted.  It was 26 years ago - I
know that because my daughter was with me and in her 9th month with
my first grandson, born Thanksgiving.

It was at the Palais (a big old fashioned theatre usually used for rock
concerts) in Melbourne, and it must have been around 1980. Yes, one of those
experiences that sears itself into your memory.

That sounds very interesting. A pluralaesthetic play, I might say, in a way.
I have often wondered while watching certain films by Jean Cocteau, if he
ever attempted to write poems out of his films - might serve as a show case
of how art might recycle within the same artist while it transcribes itself
from one media to another and back.

I tend to write out of films sometimes.

An infinite number of two-dimensional circles make a three-dimensional
spherical surface, they say, in analytical geometry. The circle of life,
of reason, of art....it goes on and on, each one trying to get us discreetly
close to that spherical surface we live on. Yet we are never there, we
will never quite be on it.

To me, the mist of that margin is where the poem resides.

Aryanil,

Yes, film is photography 24 times a second. I developed the concept of film
lumiere in an essay I wrote, "Eleven Septembers Later: Readings of Benjamin
Hollander's Vigilance, about two years ago. In "fiilm lumiere" what is seen
and what is heard decouple and move contrapuntally rather than harmonically
with each other and visual movement slows down to a state of photography.
That's what Godard is saying; reality is in the static thereness of the
photographic images which expand to the illusionary motion. My essay, as I
am usually prone to do, mixes a bunch of ideas together.

Ciao,

Murat

Thanks for the quote. That one needs to be saved.
Greenaway is fantastic, a personal favorite.
Pillow Book, I would think, is a film every language poet
must consider seeing at least for once.

Every poet for that matter.

Yes, when we talk about the sequencing of
our narrative, we seem to be talking about making
a composite picture drawn from the narratives of
the many. There is no disputing the information
contained in THAT narrative. At 24 frames per--
what really matters is the quality of the information
we have about the information. And, always, our
own narraive is just beginning.

And then, there's my favorite Peter Greenaway quote:
"We shoot 24 frames per second, but we now know
that 60 frames per second would be much better. Human
guinea pigs who have experienced projection at 60
frames per second almost feel a sense of nause at the
sense of reality."

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

New from Palm Press:

SYRIA IS IN THE WORLD
by Ara Shirinyan
At globalizing his art, Ara Shirinyan beats Walt Disney hands down. In =
this dazzling debut, Shirinyan takes post-conceptual poetics to new =
borders beyond the scope of US pop culture and media, and into the =
purloined hills and desserts of any language as English, as fodder for =
reframing: "vulgar ideas, cultural purity, nation, etc." This is a =
terrain where "striktly confidentially" gulags share the global stage =
with a long list of Soviet poet blurbs. In the end, Shirinyan reminds =
us: "You have an interest in history. You cannot miss Syria. Syria has =
monuments." Indeed, Syria Is in the World, and so is Ara Shirinyan... =
welcome aboard!--Robert Fitterman

An investigative poetic excavation of nationalism and its many guises, =
SYRIA IS IN THE WORLD is a work thick with political history flung =
through the filter of poetic perspicacity and linguistic audacity. =
Smart, snappy, and incisive, this book is a joyride of re-appropriated =
language, an unflagging examination of flags, a procedurally constrained =
yet unfettered gambit. Ara Shirinyan presses us to question the mundane, =
often arbitrary borders that separate countries from each other and us =
from us.--Jules Boykoff

What is the shape of the sound as it transcends the rectilinearity of =
official language? Does it mask out the hard angles or does it ooze =
beneath and compromise the structure itself?=20

... isosceles overlapping excess of limit
dove, anger-frames
white man equality rectangle
consent system arms covering small flag tree...

What voice can escape the intense entropy in which "a medal is =
arrogantly shaped like a medal"? It's a voice calling a country a =
"perpetual country on my back." With humor and humanity, Ara Shirinyan =
writes his way through power's symbols, so that:

All possible individual personalities in human beings hold
in possession one more than one areas set aside...
--Diane Ward

Ara Shirinyan's SYRIA IS IN THE WORLD collects five related sequences of =
conceptual works, including Republic of Georgia poems, Russia/Soviet =
poems, Poems from Here to There, Flag poems, and the eponymous Republic =
of Syria poems. These works extend the tradition of post-original or =
"sampled" poetry to consider questions of geopolitics and international =
intelligibility, questions of who is talking to who and who can hear =
what.   Drawing on a vast range of source materials, which he =
manipulates either subtly or outrageously, Shirinyan shares essential =
information, even as he comments on the ways this information has =
been/must be translated, coded, recoded, and distributed.   Shirinyan =
communicates with, at, next to, or around us in an attempt to simulate =
mastery of the Babel of world politics and world ideologies.  This is a =
poetry aware of the fact that we can never encompass the world's =
conceptual and ideological diversity, and yet must not be satisfied with =
a narrow local view.   Furiously opposed to the mandarins of =
globalization and their attempt to flatten out or smooth over cultural =
differences, Shirinyan puts his ear out to the Earth, creating a poetry =
of collection, transcription, and reinscription.

"This is the first work that thoroughly and intelligently looks at

Ginsberg's poetry in light of his Buddhism. Trigilio deftly combines

modern theories of gender identity with poststructural readings of the

texts and displays an acute knowledge of the varieties of Buddhist

practice."

--Kurt Hemmer, editor of ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BEAT LITERATURE



"Trigilio has done what is necessary to throw out once and for all the

idea that Ginsberg's engagement with Asian philosophical and religious

ideas amounts to no more than an 'easy Easternness.' For people who

want to work on Buddhism, literature, and form, this work is

groundbreaking."

--John Whalen-Bridge, author of POLITICAL FICTION AND THE AMERICAN SELF

Hello,
I saw it at The State Theatre in Sydney.
Split screen, pit orchestra - amazing.
Especially Antonin Artaud as Marat.
It was co-produced (with Coppola) in Sydney by a tv
presenter - Mike Walsh of the daytime variety 'The
Mike Walsh Show'.
1983 or 84 I think.

Alan and Alison,
I saw it also - a wonderful experience with full
symphony orchestra
and triple screen finale panorama - at Radio City
Music Hall, New
York City.  Don't remember who conducted.  It was 26
years ago - I
know that because my daughter was with me and in her
9th month with
my first grandson, born Thanksgiving.

Mike Leigh films aren't shown with subtitles in Australia (although I've
heard Australian films are subtitled in the US). Nor are any other English
dialect movies, including American. One of the blessings of being a colony
is that you become quite literate in the languages of the colonisers.

Aryanil,

Recyclings from medium to medium are processes of translation. One has the
sense of entering a core but in essence one is also altering it. In such
recyclings, if the activity is authentic and not merely self-imitation,
isn't one dealing with the potentialities of a text, medium, etc.

Is entering an essence then not entering a dynamic potential, enriching and
enriched by the energy applied to it?

In all this, photography has a central place for me. It is the supreme
medium of meditation (reflection, of thought and light) where words and
seeing join; it is the medium of liberation through which the mind "escapes"
the illusionary continuities which surround and shackle it. I elaborate on
it in "The Peripheral Space of Photography." Also, in the poem "The
Structure of Escape" I am now writing, where also many pieces originate from
movies:

"The frame of a Bresson movie is a jail
the escape is going outside that jail
it all starts with the noises one hears,
becoming one, knowing what the noises are.
that's freedom.

There is an act and the demonstration of an act.
the demonstration occurs in speech.
its act precedes or follows it in the frame,
step by step, painstaking step one after another,
the door opens itself.
the painstaking step is the expression of time as now
the future always, recurrent outside the frame
which becoming one knowing what the noises are
is escape."

Ciao,

Murat

Maybe, our "persistence of vision" that helped us adjust to 24
frames.per.sec comes from our ritual of fitting 24hrs to the
frame of a day.

And the other inventor of cinema, Thomas Edison, in
his Black Maria theater, originally used a recording
and projection frame rate of 40fps.  How did he settle
on that?  I don't know, and i'm sure it's come down to
24fps because of the economics of making film.  But
maybe he was really paying attention!

Coincidentally, there is a verified brain wave
'timecode' of 40 cycles, which might be also a widely
disseminated falsehood for all i know. (Like the
'persistance of vision' theory of cinematic movement
as Alan points out).  This 40 cycles per second
background brain hum is supposedly, or theorized to be
a kind of basic reset and synchronization period for
various brain processes, presumably also sense
gathering.  Like Greenaway, i have heard that movies
shown at a 40fps frame rate are uncannily vivid and
appear vaguely three dimensional.

I understand that in the silent era there was less of
a standard than one might assume, and the films were
shot and shown at varying frame rates from 16 up to 22
fps before the advent of sync sound. Sync sound
(printed directly on the filmstrip) required more
standardization for various reasons probably, but i
think mostly because the ear can tell small
differences in pitch much better than the eye small
differences in motion.

The Godard quote also leaves out that cinema (not
video, but film) is also nothing 24 times a second
(because of the blanks between frames).  So it's
probably safer to say that cinema gives us on average
a half-truth once a second.

Thank you for the poem, I relished reading it, esp. "the escape is going
outside that jail".

BTW, have you seen films by Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Imamura or Mohsen
Makhmalbaf ? I find them sewn with rich poetic inspiration - they
always seem to offer quality clay to the poet...soft, wet and plastic
enough to be reshapable.

To what you said about "recycling", I would like to stress that a process
of recycling essentially involves stages of change, each state so
sumptuously different from the other. I tend to accentuate that "change
thing", so recycling soon becomes recreation to me. More spiral than
circular. Interestingly, there are more spiral motions in nature than
circular. That's where I find what you refer to as " dynamic potential,
enriching and enriched by the energy applied to it".

And you are right again - these processes do help us deal with the
potentialities of the medium.

I also, think coming full circle (actually spiral) helps us realize and
absorb a change. Like a change. Change is hard to perceive along a linear
path even when it is real.

Aryanil,

Recyclings from medium to medium are processes of translation. One has the
sense of entering a core but in essence one is also altering it. In such
recyclings, if the activity is authentic and not merely self-imitation,
isn't one dealing with the potentialities of a text, medium, etc.

Is entering an essence then not entering a dynamic potential, enriching and
enriched by the energy applied to it?

In all this, photography has a central place for me. It is the supreme
medium of meditation (reflection, of thought and light) where words and
seeing join; it is the medium of liberation through which the mind "escapes"
the illusionary continuities which surround and shackle it. I elaborate on
it in "The Peripheral Space of Photography." Also, in the poem "The
Structure of Escape" I am now writing, where also many pieces originate from
movies:

"The frame of a Bresson movie is a jail
the escape is going outside that jail
it all starts with the noises one hears,
becoming one, knowing what the noises are.
that's freedom.

There is an act and the demonstration of an act.
the demonstration occurs in speech.
its act precedes or follows it in the frame,
step by step, painstaking step one after another,
the door opens itself.
the painstaking step is the expression of time as now
the future always, recurrent outside the frame
which becoming one knowing what the noises are
is escape."

Ciao,

Murat

Dear David,

I am able only to interject into your extended, fascinating thoughtflow and
see where it leads:

"Cinema is truth 24 times a second"--"Kino-Pravda" (Cine-Truth) as Vertov
> called his work, which during the late 1960's was given a great deal of
> space --via translations of texts, stills from films, commentaries,

s
> thinking and work at the time--


Barthes' essay on Einsteinstein's stills (in English, in the book "The
Responsibilities of Forms") develops the idea of the "third eye." Do you
know the essay? There Barthes points to the chaotic, "arbitrary" essence
seeing involves,. He calls it the third eye. For instance, in an
Einsteinstein still Barthes focuses on a loose thread of hair, saying that
that detail is the most important thing him in the photograph. That essay
had a profound effect on me, in the writing of The Peripheral Space. The
stasis of the photo -which can only enable the perception of that thread oh
hair- is the 1/24 of a second of "truth."

"Pravda"--"truth" as propaganda--public relations--pedagogy in the
> discourses and disciplines of the new society--an aspect of cinema and
> photography which is fascinating is that they are as much arts of
> disappearance as appearance--"the cinema shows death at work" said
> Cocteau--the very action of the actor/documentaried persons--aging moment=
 by
> moment "before one's very eyes"---frame by frame--in order for a film to
> "appear",


Of course, in a photograph, the subject before the lens, a person, a street=
,
a building, etc., is always "inexorably moving away from us," particularly
one is talking on ones created through the camera obscura model. The
underlying subject of every photograph is death. Looking at a photograph,
doesn't the brain become aware of time and its passage as an active,
continuous process, its sensuous power in our lives?

Cocteau is taking an active next step by visualizing an "art of
disappearance." In other words, he is superimposing the medium of cinema on
the medium of photography, which is what "film lumiere is."

About a year or so ago, Alan Sondheim and I had a discussion where he said
my photography book overlooked the element of manipulation every photograph
contained. We more or less arrived at a Mexican stand off, he emphasizing
the manipulative potential (digital?) and I the democratic, chaotic,
liberating impulse (analogic?) in photography.

In one of the posts in this thread, someone mentioned how an image can be
put in and removed from an action, creating a ghost-like forgery, which of
course is part of photography's history. (David, I just realized I read thi=
s
in my first reading of this very post.) From photography to films to
computers, don't all our modern media have this double edged sword quality,
promising both  freedom and control?

In 2003, I wrote a series of essays on the French photographer Fr=E9d=E9ric
Brenner's work. Over a period of more than twenty years, Brenner took photo=
s
of Jew all over the world, from China to Africa, etc. In most cases, from
the look, clothing, environment, etc., one could not tell these people were
Jews, having absorbed the qualities and aspects of their locations.

In the sixteen short essays I wrote, my underlying question was "what is a
Jewish photograph," particularly since there is the Biblical injunction
against worshipping "graven images." The answer which gradually emerged in
these essays is that a Jewish photograph must be a photograph of the
invisible, a way of looking that sees not what is in but around the images.
Of course, this parallels Cocteau's "art of disappearance" in a very
interesting way.

"'future" becoming the "present'" - One has here Bergson's time as
"duration" and Deleuse's cinema of "time image; and also the idea of time a=
s
a continuum, a continuous now in "Eda."

In "Au Hazard Balthazar," doesn't Bresson escape that "disappearance" when
he lets the donkey die right before our eyes at the end of the film? The
death is achieved by a complete stillness of Balthazar in the middle of the
meadow, a few sheep appearing from the peripheries. The donkey being a
"non-actor," how can this stillness be manipulated except by actual death.
Can Balthazar after that get up and trot away? I think the scene can not be
technically manipulated, for example by at one point substituting a
photographic still for the running film becausesimultaneously the audience
sees the moving sheep wandering around the still body and sniffing its feet=
.

Here is a poem from "The Structure of Escape," which just came out in the
new Poetry Project magazine, "Recluse" (the magazine which has replaced "Th=
e
World"):

How can you let a donkey die for your film. in a final gesture, a wandering
lamb from nowhere, sniffing its feet?

Is it because it can not act?*


* The French director Robert Bresson preferred non-actors in his movies,
preferring to record the person's physical being. In his film Au Hazard,
Balthazar the main character is a donkey, who, at the end before our eyes,
in real time, crouches in the middle of a meadow and stops moving.

Isn't then part of the very vital function of art to "unlearn," to re-see
what has disappeared. Isn't your "rubBEings," your own explorations through
streets a fight against this unified perception -the technological
"backwardness" of photography standing as a critical impediment against the
total embrace of technological overdrive?

This is my basic objection also to most of art created through the wonders
of computer technology, when this art is devoid of any critical intelligenc=
e
about its means. Basically, it is too easy. The internet, for instance, put=
s
up too little resistance (that the artist is conscious of) against what he
or she is doing. The result is euphoria, rather than ecstasy or vision. To
be continued...

photographer Man Ray.

The most intense form of silence is hearing,
as insomnia is the precarious longing for sleep,
eyes leading to blindness. I feel, old man,
seeingly, in the calligraphy of sudden thoughts.

As you say, David, here lies the true power of photography -its impulse
towards stasis, which releases invisibilities.

"artist' way of seeing", "the art of looking"--which may be without any

??? At least not with me. And I hardly think because a photograph is
'still' that its 'underlying subject is death' - this presupposes first of
all that a photograph _has_ a subject or is _of_ a subject, and that the
subject is death. And I don't think that time has a 'sensuous power,'
unless I'm missing something. I think it's too easy to theorize an image
in some ways...

I can just say that, being Jewish, this makes me uncomfortable; a "Jewish=

photograph" - if it exists at all - need not "must be" anything. I may be=

I taught Intro to Cinema for a few years when I was in Muscat. I always used
captioning as a reinforcement. Although when I showed an Algerian film,
*Rachida*, students told me that they often referred to the English
subtitles because of dialectic differences in the Arabic.

Anyway, during that asinine "cartoon controversy" in Denmark I kept hearing
this slogan repeated by local Arab Muslims: "Religion is not a laughing
matter." Well, b*llsh*t, I thought. The hell it isn't. It's been a favorite
target of lampoons for centuries in the West. (Now why couldn't they respect
*our* cultural traditions?)

Thus, I wanted to show my class  Monty Python's *The Life of Brian.*

Unfortunately, the copy at my neighborhood rental spot didn't have English
captions. Since I even had a hard time here and there with what was whipping
past my ears, I knew they would miss most of it. So, alas, I did not show it
to them due to lack of subtitles.

Wow! I didn't know "The Namesake" was dedicated to Ghatak. Nair is not
the kind of director who Ghatak might have found praise for...but that
is a different topic.

Ajantrik (Unmechanical) is such a wonderful experience!

I found an interesting website on strictly filmschool cinema run by
a an amateur film-buff, a design engineer from a NASA lab. This
site, which he built single-handedly for more than a decade now,
has lots of great stuff.

http://www.filmref.com

and here is the Ghatak page, the last picture on the page is of him
http://filmref.com/directors/dirpages/ghatak.html

and here is a fascinating page on Subarnarekha (1965), a Ghatak masterpiece
http://www.filmref.com/notes/archives/2007/03/subarnarekha_1965.html

Thanks

Aryanil,

Of the filmakers you mentioned I only know Satyajit Ray's work. I have seen
most of his movies -at least the ones which appeared in the West- at one
time or another.

The trains - the trains passing through the Indian landscape, the sounds of
the engines heard outside the frame. I think, like you, The Music Room may
be my favorite.

The others directors are all new to me. Can you tell me a few things about
them?

Ciao,

Murat

Here is an interesting French site from Paris:

a video interview with Joerg Piringer in English. There are video interviews
in French with the Epoetry organizers Philippe Bootz, Patrick Burgaud, and
Marc Verat. The site is by Hortense Gauthier. Those who attended the evening
of performances at Epoetry in Paris will recall Hortense's performance,
where she got naked at the end.

From James Lord in recounting his experience of posing for Alberto
Giacometti, quotation taken from "The Courage to Create" by Rollo May:



One day his foot accidentally struck the catch that holds the easel shelf a=
t
the proper level, which caused the canvas to fall abruptly for a foot or
two.



"Oh, excuse me!" he said. I laughed and observed that he'd excused himself
as though he'd caused me to fall instead of the painting. "That's exactly
what I did feel," he answered.

Thanks Pam. I forgot Artaud was in it! I probably didn't even know who he
was then; I was very young. As I remember, the Marat death scene used the
David painting? Or am I misremembering?

i have a couple of questions for bloggers.

suppose you have a blogspot blog (as an example). suppose the blogspot
company goes out of business. are you out of luck, then, if you have a
blogspot blog?

suppose i put a blog on vispo.com at vispo.com/blog or wherever. can i get
all the files to do this, so that my blog is absolutely not at all dependent
on blogspot or whatever company makes the blog software? no guessing,
please.

After a long time saying no I finally joined MySpace.  I still don't have a
cell phone, but am on MySpace, something some people find amusing for some
reason.  But it's kind of great in some ways, and I found MY FAVORITE
candidate for president Dennis Kucinich on there with his own campaign page.

But I'm suddenly a little annoyed.

I was just on the Kucinich site, and I wrote a comment, telling him how much
I admire his trip to Iraq with labor leaders, etc., so many things he has
done, continues to do.

BUT I FIND OUT in attempting to post this comment that it needs to await
review and approval first.

WHAT!? Oh, this is not happy news! OF ALL THE CANDIDATES running for
president in the United States, HE IS THE ONE PERSON I would never guess
such a thing from!

Review? Censors reading the comments before allowing them (or not?) to be
posted to the MySpace page?

As Potter Stewart once wrote, "Censorship reflects a society's lack of
confidence in itself."

I'm sad of Kucinich's lack of confidence.

Or maybe I'm wrong? Maybe this is someone in his campaign, some over zealous
intern who made this decision that Kucinich is unaware of? Well, I sent a
very serious e-mail to the campaign, TELLING how much I feel that such an
act reflects on Kucinich as a whole, NOT allowing the post to go through.
NOT allowing the information to flow. NOT allowing our feelings and thoughts
(WHATEVER THEY MAY BE!) to be published.

Irritated, sad, disappointed, but more confused than anything,
CAConrad

Some blog services allow you to pull backups of your blogs.

Sure, you need a free-standing blog software, of which there are many,
like Movable Type.

If what you want to do is plug into an existing blog community for its
benefits but hedge against loss, there are also blogging softwares
that post to the various communities via their APIs; so you could
maintain local copies of your posts, and then upload them via the APIs
to the community you'd chosen.

Lots of ways to do what it sounds like you want to do.

Regards,
Dan

Myspace pages, especially popular ones, are notoriously spammed by the usual suspects selling everything from spyware, personals/dating sites, to new cell phones and Sony items.  My page isn't so popular, and I still have to delete these annoying comments on a daily basis.  The comments section turns into free ad space for  spammers.

It's true about the spamming. And I'm sure political candidates attract
pretty vile spam.

wondering if anyone has any information on what might be happening in Australia at the moment re poetry. aside from a shamefully small handful of names (MTC Cronin, Tranter, Louis Armand & a few "90s" poets) I'm not aware of what the Australian poetry / poetics landscape looks like at present.  would like to kown. any info much appreciated.

Oh, see, this is why it's important to talk out loud some days!  This is
GREAT news!

I'm not used to these online sites, and spam is as good a reason as any to
review incoming mail.  Makes sense, and thanks.  My paranoia out with the
tide.

I've followed Kucinich for a long time, think he's REMARKABLE, and I'm
always waiting for him to fuck up, to be an asshole.  He's remarkably NOT!

It's exhausting watching Hillary Clinton on the news trying on new faces
everyday.  Obama is okay, but just okay.

Kucinich led a group of US union leaders to Iraq recently to forge a
document in Arabic and English about supporting labor in both countries.  Of
course Bush has outlawed labor unions in Iraq, new home of the free(?).
Kucinich was also just interviewed by Amy Goodman on DEMOCRACY NOW where he
pointed out that Bush and his administration have FINALLY provided the
necessary evidence of war crimes with the latest bill which involves
allowing international oil companies into Iraq for exploit/export.

Exploit/Export have(has) always felt like A word to me.
Maybe not exclusively, but enough that it's just so right/wrong.

And I would LOVE to have Dennis's baby, and we would have our own reality TV
show about American Baby following her amazing father on the trail to make
world history by finding the cinch pinch on impeaching the fucking Devil out
of the white house!  American Baby would always be dressed in purple because
she's the transitional baby.  Does this make sense?  Am I really attempting
to make sense you ask?  Hell no!  American Baby would not allow the
moth-eaten flag to be used for anything better than a diaper!

Need to share with those of you who are interested in learning more about China some information. Steve Nessen is a talented writer, a friend, and I'll take some credit in bringing him to China almost five years ago to Haerbin. Could say more, but then he has yet to depart. Some of us here, to be honest, have merely exploited our China experience in mostly self-serving ways, disregarding what is a disturbing pattern of "uniquely troubling" intentional occurrences. Others, as is always the case, have chosen to examine things in great depth.

You may think using your mobile phone to send text messages is something for teenagers, but in many parts of Asia, text-messages are a social lifeline for all ages. They can also be a powerful tool for organizing social activism in a country with tightly controlled media, such as China.

marginally on point--I lived in Cleveland when Kucinich was mayor--his
ideals are wonderful but am not sure he is practical enough to have even a
small % of US citizens for him--for instance he is against ALL wars.
Congrats on all your involvements, CA.

I use wordpress for a bunch of sites I administer. As long as you
keep it updated you shouldn't have a problem with blogspam or
corruption.  The best thing about doing your own install, other than
controlling the data is that there is a huge community which is
developing extensions, so it's a system which is far more extensible
than something like blogspot.

The install is here & works out of the box:

I own vispo.com. Currently I host with company A. But they eventually slide,
so usually I change hosting services every couple of years. When I do, all I
do is change the DNS name server and upload my site to the new server (for
the most part). I don't have anything on my site that's specific to a
particular hosting company. That way the site stays portable.

But if you have a blogspot (or whatever) blog and they go out of business or
they start charging money or whatever and you want/need to move, I'm under
the impression you're in a bind. Or am I mistaken? I'm under the impression
you have a bunch of web pages in a template specific to that company.

What do you mean by "blogspam"? Comments written by others and robots to the
blog?

What do you mean by "corruption"?

What is involved in keeping it updated? Installing new versions of Wordpress
as they are released?

> The best thing about doing your own install, other than
> controlling the data is that there is a huge community which is

What sort of extensions? What sort of functionality is provided by the
extensions?

Suppose you host a Wordpress blog on yourdomain.com. Does the Wordpress blog
make Javascript calls to a central Wordpress server? This of course would
set up a dependency on the Wordpress server. So that if the Wordpress server
is changed or goes under, the blog ceases to function properly even though
it is hosted on a separate domain. Is this the sort of "corruption" you
refer to?

Please distinguish a site from a blog. What, to you, is primarily involved
in the distinction?

From what I can see, the main things about a blog are the following. A blog
supports user comments on posts. It also supports syndication of the blog
content on other blogs that share the same syndication technology.

Yes, usually it's just a matter of uploading a few files that are new

There are hundreds of extensions for Wordpress with all kinds of
functions. I currently have more than a dozen installed, including
plug-ins to block spam comments, to automatically create nice lists
out of my subpages, to cross-post to my livejournal and create
navigation, as well as one that can generate a backup of my Wordpress
database and email it to me.

Everything I need to run Wordpress is installed on my server.

For me, a blog is a regular sort of newsletter-journal. It's much more
interactive than my sites because people leave me comments and I reply
to them.

Those are both true, and two of the primary values of a blog, yeah.

I love waking up to poetry in my feed reader. :)

Aryanil,
Yes, it very well could be a kind of conditioning. And at the
same time I think that technology (this one!) influences the
medium: sight, sound, and the compound they form as poetry.
I believe it's done it in much the sme way as, say, fresco or
tempera painting in modern Europe, for example, lasted about
three centuries. To poetry, I would appply these same
considerations. Seems the phenomenon is concerned with
three generations: the first invents the way, the second
consolidates it and the third throws it away.

What it seems to come down to is the way that some people
try to put all the world's information in one place. Since the
beginning of the post-Greco-Roman concern for narrative,
Bocacio, Petrarch, Shakespeare, Milton, Joyce used as
central the narrative trace and paradigms of of tales from the
East, starting a consolidation of all the world's tropes in terms
of narrative put together in one place. Much of the work we've
seen in Ronald Johnson, Pound and Zuk., Bunting, Howe have
attempted to bring all the different ways by which we can explain,
describe activity in terms of one bin in one place. I think it's significant
to think about these (and all the others) because it seems to indicate
a demand for consolidation so heightened, that they had to invent a
new launguage. That's true of any technique coming of age and as
the new techniques are now mature, there is indeed a demand for
their synthesis. There's a whole series of poets that have wanted to
create a work that would "unite the angels in their helms with the
stones in the road", an extrordinary ambition. Some have gone a
long way to find that particular synthesis. For whatever reason,
conditioning or not, we continue to shuffle the cards, make
connections and rearrangements of what we are familiar with,
in order to demonstrate the extraordinary exitementes of this
world and to show our attempts to get it down. Conditioned
perhaps by creation myths, the first parallel of that was the namer(s),
the notiion that they were allowed by God to name everything, listing,
but also bringing into consciousness things that can be discussed.

Yes, it's always our persistence...

Yes, I would seriously think any medium
remade periodically by technique--whether
it is film, video, painting, sculpture-- or the
free jazz of Cecil Taylor, must be considered.

Why, thank you, Desmond - I think - for that unexpectedly enthusiastic
endorsement.

I think that Richard was looking for younger poets that those in Calyx
(edited by Peter Minter and Michael Brennan, themselves very interesting
poets) although it is a decent survey, mostly of a range of poets, including
myself, who emerged in the 90s. John Kinsella's Landbridge gives a good
overview of the past 30 years or so, with a number of newer names, but
again, it's mostly my generation or younger. Mind you, we're now in our 40s
and just beginning to come into our own - Peter's last book, Blue Grass,
which came out last year, is just fantastic. Emma Lew is another you should
check out if you haven't encountered her work.

There are a bunch of younger poets, very diverse - names that have struck me
are Brett Dionysus, Morgan Yasbincek, Jasmine Chan, Petra White, Ali
Alizadeh. You might look at the Young Poets series out of Five Islands
Press, which is admittedly patchy but which is bringing a lot of new voices
into the purview, and at John Leonard Press, a new (if conservative)
imprint. Another source is Ivor Indik's Heat magazine and Giramondo Press;
though that mainly publishes established writers, they've brought out
Dionysus' new book.

All the best

Alison

Hi Rich,

Interesting list of names there. Hmm.

I'm not sure you could encapsulate 'what's going on in Australian
poetry at the moment' except to say there's lots going on.

There are Australian poets who are part of this list, including
myself. Both Alison Croggon and Pam Brown made contributions to
discussion over the last few days.

You could look at a few sites although they certainly won't tell you
the whole story:

Poetry International Web:
http://australia.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/
index.php?obj_name=australia

Australian Literature Resources
http://www.austlit.com/a/index.html

Three out of many Australian literary journals are online and present
very different slants on Australian poetry, though they don't just
publish Australian work:

Cordite
http://www.cordite.org.au/

The Famous Reporter
http://walleahpress.com.au/past.html

foam:e
http://www.foame.org/

There's plenty more out there and I'm sure the other Australians on
the list have much more to add. I've just done a quick list before I
go out into a blustery Sydney Saturday morning to do some shopping
chores. You can even check out my blog (in the sig below).

If you have any specific questions maybe one of us can help out.

Cheers,
Jill

Hi -

I've been working with Sandy Baldwin on a book, and I revised my

the revision at http://www.asondheim.org/essay.txt and would appreciate
any comments you might have. It's somewhat of a difficult read but

I know John Tranter and think he'd be a great source. He's an especially gracious poet, along the lines of Creeley. Email him, I'd suggest.

Does anyone know of a reasonably priced (or perhaps ridiculously
cheap) Chicago-area letterpress facility, cooperative, collective or
just a dude with a vandercook or C & P that likes to have friends help
out with bills and share the goods?

We'll be in Chicago as of the end of July and are looking to get set
somewhere, though don't have a whole lot a money...collective type
stuff would probably be best.

Also, apologies to anyone if we haven't replied about other Chicago
correspondences. Has been tricky getting everything figured out for
the move and keeping in touch at the same time.

all best,
Michael Koshkin

Alan,

Ever since you brought up the distinction between digital and analogical, I
am trying to understand what they mean, possibly unsuccessfully. When I say
"manipulated," I imply a state of total control. If you remember, you had
mentioned that even in the most "candid" of 19th century war photos, often
the pose was "set." Whereas, when I look at a photograph, I am looking for =
a
point of entry which "escapes" the photographer's framing, an act by the
subject (anything before the lens) free of the photographer's focus or
beyond the medium's total technical prowess. For instance, referring to
solarization, is solarization a mistake -due to the 19th century lens'
inability to record actions, as in The Battle of Wilderness photos -an
accident, or is it an intentional blur, an arty pose manipulated by the
artist? For me, what makes photography vital is the former. Of course, we
may be having a cat chasing its own tail here, what is manipulated or not
being "unknowable" except as outside documentation.

    >
    I can just say that, being Jewish, this makes me uncomfortable; a
"Jewish
    photograph" - if it exists at all - need not "must be" anything. I may
be
    way off base here, but think for example of any other ethnicity or for
    that matter religious culture - where is the "must be"? And an
injunction
    against worshipping "graven images" isn't the same as saying they
    shouldn't be made.


Alan, here I must explain the circumstances under which these essays got
written. Brenner came to me and said he was preparing a collection of the
photographs he took the previous twenty years or so (of Jews around the
world) and asked me to write essays on fifteen photos I chose. His project
involved two volumes. The first contained approximately seventy-five photos=
.
In the second, each page contained one photo in a smaller size surrounded b=
y
texts/commentaries by a number of writers, in the fashion of The Talmud,
words surrounded by commentary. There were I think twenty-five writers in
total, not all Jews. A few I remember are Andre Aciman, Amiel Alcalay,
Jacques Derrida, Daniel Epstein, Carlos Fuentes, Julius Lester, etc. (The
volumes got published by HarperCollins in 2003, the texts, at least my own,
dolorously butchered beyond belief, an admonitory tale about mainstream
publication, basically of total futility.)

Before becoming a photographer, Brenner was an anthropologist. When I looke=
d
at the photos assigned to me -some of them very powerful, due to Brenner's
eye for anthropological detail- I realized none of the people before the
lens looked Jewish. I only had Brenner's given words for it. Rather, the
people looked more like the people of the environment in which the photos
were taken. They were poor farmers in an isolated Russian village or tea
drinkers in a tea shop in Azerbaijan. One was a beautiful tawny skinned
African woman covered with black robes except for her face -she looking
straight at the camera- and her bare feet, in a cave in Yemen, etc.

The question, beyond Brenner's assertion, what in these people is Jewish wa=
s
asked by me in the face of this absence, the complete absence of any
tangible signs, a mezuzah or a talit or a menorah, etc. (The photos taken i=
n
Israel and The United States did have these signs, but I had not chosen any
of them.) This question -like a puzzle- became the dynamic force which
permeated my looking at all the photos, some of them truly amazing.

One of the photos, taken in Ukraine in 1989 was of "Leonid Semyonovich
Doctor, hatter." He is sitting on a chair, looking straight at the lens.
Behind him, who is very short and is wearing an overcoat, there is a displa=
y
of three rows of hats on the wall. The grid of hats has one empty slot,
presumably the missing hat which the doctor is wearing. The wall of hats
occupy a much greater space than the diminutive hat maker, giving the row o=
f
hats a powerful, totemic quality. To me, the missing hat in the grid
appearing on the man's hat is the key, the crucial gesture in this
photograph, implying that this small man, almost a midget, is identifying
himself with his hats. At this point in the text, if I remember correctly, =
I
introduce the phrase "the hats, c'est moi," implying that what the Doctor i=
s
projecting an artistic gesture, paralleling "Madame Bovary, c'est moi."

Within the context of a small community (or the space of this photograph)
there is something subversive, even blasphemous, in Leonid's gesture =96a
factor of pride in the totemic aura of the hats,  of self definition. That'=
s
when I first thought of the Biblical injunction against worshipping graven
images. What is the position and function of an artist in the Jewish (or
any) culture, of a Spinoza or a Kafka, etc.? Are artists "avatars" of
earlier eras, excommunicated or judged by an equally invisible divinity?
This question of invisibility also dovetails with my views on photography,
that in a photograph the most potent spots are peripheral, those spots wher=
e
the photographer has not focused his or her attention.

In other words, Alan, I have no interest at all in the ethnic, picturesque
or ritual aspects of Judaism. For me, the question of a Jewish photograph i=
s
primarily ethic, and consequentially, artistic. The ethical issue what a
Jewish writer needs to write =96his or her relation to power and authority-
all what the essay "Questions of accent" is all about.

Seymour Hersh  and former Army Major General Antonio M. Taguba in this
week's New Yorker For the moment, probably the closer we are going to get on
Bush's Torture Mafia. Scary stuff. A bunch of Pentagon people (Rumsfeld,
Cambone, Miller, Bush et al) here who clearly should be 'taken in' and fully
exposed for 'high' crimes in their blind pursuit of 'terror'. Until they are
brought to some form of real justice - nationally and internationally, I
suspect this country will continue to endure and  project a long, dark
blemish of itself - domestically and externally. Currently, it seems to me,
we live in the eternal Pinochet moment.

Anyway, the piece is much worth the read. And, at least, people such as
Taguba are beginning to out their so-called "superiors."

Hi Murat, this isn't personal, but I'm still uncomfortable; "Jewish"=20
unfortunately is overdetermined and there are the usual debates about=20
whether it's religious or cultural, what have you. There _are_ ethnic=20
aspects of Judaism that are _inherent_ in the discussion; these are of=20
course issues of labeling, stuff Gilman writes about. Issues of "looking=20
Jewish" are also involved, and I'm not sure what that even means,=20
particularly in the complex of European partially-assimilated Jewry of the=
=20
19th-20th centuries. I'm not sure what else to say; the expression bothers=
=20
me and the best I can come up with is there might be writers/artists who=20
would call themselves "Jewish writers/artists" - thinking maybe of Chagall=
=20
for example. But this is also problematic.

Is a Jewish photograph a photograph taken by a Jew? Obviously not; this=20
would bring absurd notions of ethnicity into play. Is it a photograph of=20
"something Jewish"? What if it were of, say, a synagogue, taken by a=20
Catholic? Beyond these, I have no idea - if you look for that something=20
else, punctum, whatever, it's very problematic to me; that gets down to=20
the idea of a Jewish "essence," whatever.

I know this is probably way of track, but it's an issue for me.

Solarization, as you apparently know, hasn't been=20
accidental for a long time--one does it in the=20
darkroom, and one does it until one gets the=20

shots there was the choice whether to keep the result.

The underlying idea I am getting at is that of "mistake," something beyond
intention or techncal prowess. For instance. in Hitchcock's "North By
Northwest," in the cafeteria in Mount Roshmore, a little kid covers his ear=
s
before a shot pretending to kill Cary Grant is fired. For me, no authentic
art is possible -at least the kind that does anything for me- without this
kind of mistake which breaks open the seal of a totally definable system. I=
n
the Hitchcock movie, that instinctual gesture by the kid brings into the
open all the re-takes which must have preceded the narrative image on the
screen -it creates an x-ray of the film art.

There is a world of difference between solarization as effect, pulled down
from the menu, and solarization as mistake, which is what occurs in the
specific Civil War photos I mention (which are Anonymous by the way). It is
true that the resistance of dynamic movement to have its picture taken
belongs to the early stages of photography. But it is in these early stages
that one can see most clearly the chaotic, radical nature of photography as
a medium. When later photographers try to re-create the "mistake" effects o=
f
early photographs, the intention is essential "painterly," compositional,
the result of "intentions." Whereas, as I tried to show in my essay,
photography is involved with the "perilous" movements of light, very
different from painting. Here is a passage:

"This 'glow' [inherent in 19th century photographic light], opacity has
nothing to do with the photographer's intentions. In fact, 19th century
photography can be seen as a constant struggle in technique to make the
photographic image 'transparent,' from paper negatives to glass negatives,
from salted paper prints to albumen silver prints, etc. The glow is the
result of the medium's 'failure' to achieve perfect transparency. This
'failure' materializes the light, makes it something inherent in the
material, emanating from it. This 'blurring' is not intentional, but exists
at the very edge of technique" ("The Peripheral Space of Photography," Gree=
n
Integer Press).

One can see the same distinction between daguerreotypes and later studio
portraits codified by Brady. In daguerrotypes, the arrangement of subjects
before the lens is to our eyes chaotic, men assuming female postures, black
figures in dominant positions, a certain over crowding, etc. That's where
the power of daguerreotypes lie. They capture a moment before "order" (in
other words, language) was established.

That's where we completely disagree. There is the photographer's focus, and
there is the lens, which has its own independence. The introduction of the
lens, nonexistent before, is at the heart of everything new about
photography; first, by creating a dialectic between what is before the lens
and the lens, and, second, by widening the space beyond an individual
consciousness.

The photographer, later on, can spend as much in the dark room as he or she
wants; the art of photographic looking is distinguishing between what the
photographic space opens to the onlooker and what the photographer sees.

I find this somewhat incoherent, but yup, we apparently disagree. And
there's no way to discuss it fi=urther here, given the
strangelimitations imposed by the listserv.

The lens, by the way, antedates the camera by a couple of centuries.

One can't argue with conoisseurship - when you say "the kind that does
anything for me" - that's a personal-psychological judgement. But "no
authentic art is possible"? - That's again another problematic statement I
think. It's your take on things; it does by the way exclude any possibil-
ity of art within a game structure where the rules are just there as
backdrop, in=forming structure.

Your history of photography is very different from mine. I hardly think
this characterizes 19th-century photography, any more than anything else;
there were not only a wide variety of technologies, but also styles, etc.
ruing the period.

Again: Which daguerrotypes? They're certainly not chaotic to me, and there
are all sorts and histories of daguerrotypes.

I think you're caught up in all these metaphors, over-arching judgments...

Exactly what does it mean that a "lense has its own independence"? And the
intro of the lens as you know goes way back before photography. And what
do you mean "beyond an individual consciousness"? What sort of space is
_within_ an individual consciousness that th elens goes beyond?

Another blanket statement - the "art of photographic looking" can mean
just about anything - in your formulation it brings intentionality into
play in an odd way: a. The viewer sees something the photographer doesn't
see. b. We know what the photographer doesn't see because we know how to
look.


I think there's a lot at stake for me, which why I'm replying out of
order. I don't think one can generalize about the 19th century, daguerro-
type, photogrpahic or photographer's vision, Jewish art, or whatever; I
think one has to look, and the more one looks, the more judgments of this
sort, which work metaphorically at best, dissolve. I worry about judgment
and its relation to totality in general.

LibriVox Releases Free Audiobook of James Joyce's Ulysses
in celebration of Bloomsday, 2007

LibriVox.org, an online volunteer project with an objective of
recording all public domain books into audio, will release a free
audio version of James Joyce's Ulysses, in time for Bloomsday, June
16, 2007.

The Internet, June 15, 2007 - In celebration of Bloomsday,
LibriVox.org has released an unabridged audio version of James Joyce's
Ulysses. As with all LibriVox recordings, the audio is in the public
domain, and available for anyone to download for free in mp3 and ogg
vorbis format.

The work comprises more than 32 hours of audio, and the project took a
year-and-a-half to complete, with scores of volunteer
participants. Started in November 2005, it is one of LibriVox's
longest-running projects, and is also the longest text we have
recorded.

The LibriVox Ulysses project had a few special rules: readers were
encouraged to read in groups, in public places, and no editing was
required. And yet some of the sections (notably, sections 15 and 18 )
have been done with extraordinary attention to detail and
creativity. The audiobook can be downloaded here:
http://librivox.org/ulysses-by-james-joyce/

Bloomsday also sees the release of another Joyce novel, Portrait of
the Artist as a Young Man, which can be found at:
http://librivox.org/a-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-man-by-james-joyce/

There is some rumbling within the LibriVox community about trying to
produce a new audio version of Ulysses every two years.

About LibriVox.org:

LibriVox is an open, international volunteer project with the
objective of making all public domain books available as free audio
books. We have a catalog of 685 works, in sixteen languages. Listeners
can listen on the computers, or using portable media devices such as
ipods. We are a totally volunteer, open source, free content, public
domain project. We host our files at the Internet Archive
(archive.org) and ibiblio.org, and get the majority of our texts from
Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.org).

Dear List,

What presses are making the most physically beautiful books?  I've realized
that as I go to find a home for my 2nd manuscript what I really want is a
press that has (a) a good list (b) of beautifully designed/produced books
that get (c) moderately okay distribution.   Actually, maybe (b) comes
first! There's nothing as intoxicating as a beautiful book.

Help me out here.

Aaron

Hi all,

Two new publications which may be of interest to ELO members.

ALT-X PRESS LAUNCHES "ILLOGIC OF SENSE: THE GREGORY L. ULMER REMIX" AS THE
LATEST ADDITION TO ITS INFLUENTIAL EBOOK SERIES

The Alt-X Online Network, a space "where the digerati meet the literati" and
on the Internet since 1993, announces the release of a new Alt-X Press ebook
entitled "Illogic of Sense: The Gregory Ulmer Remix" edited by Darren Tofts
and Lisa Gye, and designed by artist Joel Swanson of hippocrit.com.

Illogic of Sense: The Gregory L. Ulmer Remix Edited by Darren Tofts and Lisa
Gye Design by Joel Swanson http://www.altx.com/ebooks/ulmer.html

Contributors include Niall Lucy, Jon McKenzie, Linda Marie Walker, Craig
Saper, Rowan Wilken, Marcel O'Gorman, Teri Hoskin, and Michael Jarrett, with
an introduction by editors Tofts and Gye.

"Illogic of Sense: The Gregory L. Ulmer Remix" is an exciting new ebook
publication that employs theorist Gregory Ulmer's invocation to invent new
forms of electronic writing. As the ebook's editors, Darren Tofts and Lisa
Gye, write in their brilliant introduction, "Ulmer has been at the forefront
of thinking about new cultural formations as the paradigm of  literacy
converges with digital culture." Ulmer's work has been central to
contemporary thinking on the future of writing and his international
presence as one of the leading figures in media arts discourse has
influenced a multitude of disciplines from electronic literature and
Internet art to critical theory, communications studies, and art history.
The ebook features a diverse group of artists, theorists, and creative
writers who develop new forms of hybridized "digital rhetoric." Their
inventive and audacious experiments take advantage of recent developments in
the field of new media studies, and as part of Alt-X's mission to
participate in the creative commons provided by the Web, are available for
free download.

This provocative collection of multi-tracked writing puts into play many of
Ulmer's breakthrough theories summed up in his most recognized hot-button
terms: applied grammatology, heuretics, post(e)-pedagogy, textshop, mystory,
and choragraphy. Encouraged by the example of Ulmer's own hyperrhetorical
writing style, the authors incorporate collaged imagery, mp3 soundtracks,
and QuickTime movies into their innovative multimedia mix while exploring
how these same extensions of "writerly performance" explode the false
barrier between academic discourse and  spontaneous poetics, narrative and
rhetoric, and autobiography and fiction. Positing an "illogic of sense" to
reclaim what Ulmer calls an "anticipatory consciousness," designed to
utilize the force of intuition as a way to invent emergent forms of
knowledge, this grouping of hypermedia texts showcase how interdisciplinary
writers can remix the methodological approach of an avant-garde philosophy
propelled by Ulmer, one that prioritizes an ongoing process of discovery and
media arts assemblage.

The ebook is beautifully designed by artist Joel Swanson of hippocrit.com,
who crosses his visionary design sensibility with state of the art
technology to produce an original work of ebook-art that many will view as
finally fulfilling the long-promised potential of online publishing to use
stimulating visual arrangement, media hybridization, and typographical
ingenuity to blur the distinction between publication, exhibition, and
design performance.

"Simultaneously celebrating and expanding on the writing performances
located in Gregory Ulmer's rich oeuvre of totally remixable source material,
the collection of essays in 'Illogic of Sense' adhere to an experiential
approach to creative/critical writing and in so doing teach us how to write
a theory of poetics that will help us invent a new field of study that I
would call interdisciplinary digital humanities." - Mark Amerika, series
editor, Alt-X Press; author of "META/DATA: A Digital Poetics" (MIT Press,
2007)

META/DATA: A Digital Poetics (The MIT Press, 2007) by Mark Amerika

This rich collection of writings by pioneering digital artist Mark Amerika
mixes (and remixes) personal memoir, net art theory, fictional narrative,
satirical reportage, scholarly history, and network-infused language art.
META/DATA is a playful, improvisatory, multitrack "digital sampling" of
Amerika's writing from 1993 to 2005 that tells the early history of a net
art world "gone wild" while simultaneously constructing a parallel poetics
of net art that complements Amerika's own artistic practice.

Unlike other new media artists who may create art to justify their theories,
Amerika documents the emergence of new media art forms while he creates
them. Presenting a multifaceted view of the digital art scene on subjects
ranging from interactive storytelling to net art, live VJing, online
curating, and Web publishing, Amerika gives us "Spontaneous Theories,"
"Distributed Fictions" (including his groundbreaking GRAMMATRON, the helpful
"Insider's Guide to Avant-Garde Capitalism," and others), the more scholarly
"Academic Remixes," "Net Dialogues" (peer-to-peer theoretical explorations
with other artists and writers), and the digital salvos of "Amerika Online"
(among them, "Surf-Sample-Manipulate: Playgiarism on the Net," "The Private
Life of a Network Publisher," and satirical thoughts on "Writing as
Hactivism"). META/DATA also features a section of full-color images,
including some of Amerika's most well-known and influential works.

Provocative, digressive, nomadic, and fun to read, Amerika's texts call to
mind the cadences of Gertrude Stein, the Beats, cyberpunk fiction, and
even The Daily Show more than they do the usual new media theorizing.
META/DATA maps the world of net culture with Amerika as guide and resident
artist.


Reviews


"META/DATA perfectly captures the essence and style of pioneering net artist
and online fiction writer Mark Amerika. Featuring a mix of scholarly theory,
personal narrative, and conversations with peers, the book provides both
meta data on the artist's multifaceted body of work and insightful
commentary on digital poetics and culture. The personae Amerika has created
for himself--from 'digital thoughtographer' to VJ as artist-researcher--are
reflected as different viewpoints in the book's stories, theoretical essays,
and dialogues, and make it a multilinear read that mirrors the diversity of
digital culture."
--Christiane Paul, Adjunct Curator of New Media Arts, Whitney Museum of
American Art

"Mark Amerika is at the cutting edge of developments in both art and
technology. META/DATA is an indispensable guide to the promises and
potentials of new media--and also to the hype, irony, and disappointment
that all too often surround them."
--Steven Shaviro, DeRoy Professor of English, Wayne State University

"Mark Amerika is a hacker. He hacks language, image, sound, identities,
cultures. He plays space, time, and tech like a saxophone. He plays out, way
out sometimes, but he will always beckon you to join him. His writings are
like invitations to a happening party you don't know you are already at.
It's dense, it's hard, but it flows, and it's fun. What more could you
want?"
--McKenzie Wark, author of Gamer Theory

Aaron,

I think the Green Boathouse Press up in B.C. that is run in part by Jason Dewinetz makes lovely, lovely chapbooks.  I'm not sure if they do full books, but they are worth contacting.  I have continued to be impressed.

Hi Aaron,
=20
I've been asking the same question, and I'm happy you put this out to the
list. Of course there's a long history here and the question of beauty is
invariably difficult, BUT off the cuff:
=20
Michael Cross has been publishing fantastic books with Atticus Finch,
including works by Lisa Jarnot, Gregg Biglieri, John Taggart, Myung Mi Kim,
Elizabeth Willis, and rumor has it that something by Patrick Durgin is in
the works. David Pavelich's Answer Tag in Chicago just put out a stunning
collaboration (printed letterpress) between Joel Felix and Wallace Whitney.
Anna at Ugly Ducking sent me a new chapbook by Kostas Anagnopoulos that
arrived this morning and I'm consistently astonished by their sensitive
editing, production, design, distribution=8Bthe whole project. Alastair
Johnston and Francis Butler's Poltroon Press, Steve Clay's Granary Books,
Charles Alexander's Chax Press, and Simon Cutts and Erica Van Horn's Coracl=
e
are all legendary. I'm also partial to the solid typography and attention t=
o
detail that trade edition publishers like Krupskaya, Litmus, Burning Deck,
Tuumba, Tougher Disguises, and Atelos bring to the work. I=B9m certain that
I=B9m making some horrible omissions here.
=20
It seems to me that the second snag is finding a publisher who will read
unsolicited work. I=B9m not pointing to your ms. in particular, but I do thin=
k
it=B9s a problem that so many publishers (myself included) don=B9t have the tim=
e
or resources to entertain the possibility of publishing something that
wasn=B9t written on commission or sent by way of invitation.
=20
Cheers,
=20
Kyle

    Every time i read, hear, see the quote attributed to Godard--"Cinema is=
 truth 24 times a second"--         i think--and yes, who is telling one th=
is? "who speaks?"    A film maker, of course!!  (who may have swiped it fro=
m another director, Vertov and his Kino-Pravda      films--)    But then wh=
at else can one expect from a guy named "God-art"?  A "Mr. Know-it-All" to =
the manor born!??    When a balogna maker tells you that his balogna is "tr=
uth balogna, the one true balogna 24 times per     mouthful"--    Do you ta=
ke him at his word--or do you say--"Aw, come off it, man, he's just full of=
 balogna!"      Thank you Murat, Alan and Mark, this is a very fascinating =
discussion--  this article from the NY Times re Venice Biennale is an examp=
le-(see below for the direct link) -of  "reporting from the scene" in what =
has become  a trope, really, of the convergences of text/art/foto/journalis=
m--in which some lines from Henry James' 19th century eyes frame the most c=
ontemporary art, which is "mixed in" as it were with the "contemporary art"=
-via-photography version of seeing the ancient, the random, the found, the =
decaying in the city in which the art show takes place--as "already art", "=
readymades" yet which the art critic/writer sees that way because the his e=
ye has been trained by art to see these, and refer them back to art--      =
 what is interesting here is that the Henry James "eye" is seeing these thi=
ngs without using "art" and fotos of  "art" as its basis, but the ARTIST'S =
EYES THEMSELVES are seeing into the city and finding things which engage th=
e artist-     -(the artist/writer Henry James who in turn wrote many storie=
s about artists and writers and their seeing in the world, in which often t=
he collisions among forms of perception in relation with judgements, totali=
ties cause collapses--the "crack in the Golden Bowl" which is an insight an=
d at the same time an avalance, both uncovering a cover-up and being swampe=
d in turn by what Robert Smithson called the experience of an "oceanic cons=
ciousness"--which "for it to be art has to have limits"--the artist needs t=
o do a further work on finding a "container" for the expression of the expe=
rience or be buried/drowned alive--and, existing within time,--a dialectics=
 of the "time/frame" in all senses of the words-- the artist becomes concer=
ned further with the dialectics of the non-object production of the "artist=
's art of looking" and the expression of it in an "art object" in which the=
 "time of the artist" becomes emprisoned and takes on "value" in a market o=
r critical ordering of objects--)    what the author of the Times article i=
s presenting in a sense is the totalizing of what had been in James' case a=
 finding of "cracks in the Golden Bowl"  -      (and in the novel of that n=
ame, one has the oppositions of several competing--for social status, for w=
ealth, for marriage as monogamous, etc etc--ways of looking--the Italian pr=
ince, who tries to understand American ways of looking via Poe's Arthur Gor=
don Pym--as opposed to the American financier father who tries to imagine t=
he world seen by Spanish explorers as presented in a famous British poem--a=
mong other examples of "conquests")      the Times writer is "laying bare t=
he device" (in a Brechtian sense of mise-en-scene) of a contemporary "touri=
st-as-art critical see-er" or "art-critic as tourist"--mode of seeing--in w=
hich the city itself becomes not only a "work of art", a "museum without wa=
lls" but also a way of thinking one is seeing because one is seeing in term=
s of art--everything "looks like" a painting--or a foto of art---looks like=
 a famous or qualified "art image"--     the totalization of perception as =
a way of "recognizing" art in the world outside the gallery--aestheticizes =
the world into am image-commodification--"covering over the cracks" with a =
form of aesthetic wall paper--the "world" in this totality, vanishes--and i=
s replaced by the images of it which are seen, "discovered" by the eye trai=
ned to see in this way--which as the Times writer implies--is open to anyon=
e, a sort of amusing game one can play--     yet the rules of the game are =
to see in the world that which is seen already--by seeing as presented in i=
mages, objects, examples--one can "play" at "an artist's way of looking"--a=
nd see "art and life" as "interchangeable"--in terms of their "exchangeabil=
ity" as art objects, images, commodities--     this identity of "art and li=
fe" however is a "readymade"--NOT a seeing--but a recognizing and naming, "=
name it and claim it"----of the world as a gallery--a museum--of "the excha=
nge between art and life"--the key word being "exchange"--as in "stock exch=
ange"--     the "breaking down the barriers between art and life" instead o=
f being a way of seeing something "new" or "radical" or "other" becomes ins=
tead the erection of new walls of seperation between art and life--gallery =
walls as it were--an aesthetics which purposes "liberation" and instead bec=
omes a new form of imprisonment and control--and commodification        (Be=
njamin's discussion of Neue Sachlichkeit for example, points out the totali=
zing aspects of this "aestheticization of reality")      this form of aesth=
eticization is a valuing of the "clean"--the "clean image"--"the cleaned ou=
t or up city spaces"--a driving out and away of the "dirty"--in aesthetic a=
nd population senses--a form of urban class, homeless, ethnic cleaning--str=
eet cleaning--as opposed to the "dirty look" in art/writing--and in populat=
ions, streets, squares, neighborhoods--      one of the things which struck=
 me in Murat's discussion of a Jewish way of seeing, and this in connection=
 with the ways in which a photograph  may  "show Jewish identity"--is that =
this is a two-edged sword--on the one hand--a search for identity and ident=
ification (identification with and identification as--again a two edged swo=
rd)--which can be an affirmation--(or an "empowerment"--)     OR  identific=
ation of a way of seeing and a way of being seen--can turn into Profiling--=
a way of identifying "the suspect"--"the Jew"--by "tell-tale identifying si=
gns and behaviours"--         this is a two edged sword whose most appallin=
g effects are all too well known to history--which is continually being upd=
ated as it were--via Homeland Security--border patrols--fences, walls--stre=
et surveillance systems in towns--daily life turned into an endless series =
of "checkpoints"--     there is a very interesting and at the same time "si=
mple" (simplistic, simpleminded perhaps to the sophsticated--) series of po=
sters regarding addiction/alcocholism--     the posters show twenty or more=
 faces of humans--in rows, like fotos in a yearbook--people of all races an=
d colors, ages, sexes--(for there are more than two, really)--backgrounds, =
attire--    the posters have variants of a question or a statement--which f=
ocuses on the idea--which one or ones  "looks like" an addict, an alcoholic=
?    who here "fits the profile"?    the answer of course is that they ALL =
are addicts and drunks--yet for most people the profile would identify only=
 two or three persons as "definietly looking like a junkie/a lush"--    i l=
ike this poster, for all its seeming crudeness--for it opens up the chaotic=
, uncertain, "nature" of visuality--in relation to questions of "identity/i=
dentification"--to questions of camouflage (how "one can't judge a book by =
the cover"--so are things one sees "covering up"--or "uncovering" as they "=
speak to us" from their foto, their "likeness" in modes of seeing which are=
 not seeing--but a "reading of appearances"--?)--opens to questions of disg=
uise, masquerade, distraction--in the expansion of the "still" of a "seen" =
person into a "scene" and from there into a "scenario"--a "cinematography"-=
-of "creative non-fiction"--a "reverie""--a "meditation"--a "propaganda"--a=
n "advertisment"--a "documentary"--an "investigation"--"of a way of life" a=
s a commodity--    the little sentence preceding  "The Fourteenth Ward" sec=
tion of Henry Miller's Black Spring reads:"What is not in the open street i=
s false, derived, that is to say, literature."  (The last word is italiczed=
.)     This has been a guiding maxim of mine since a teenager--and one whic=
h indicates the difficulty of "the artist's way of looking."  For--is the "=
open street"--still "open"--or is it closed off, already become something w=
hich exists only through the ways in which it is recognized as "the street"=
?       And if one works with "an artist's way of looking" by which to crea=
te "a work of art" which is not an object--not an emprisonment--of "the str=
eet"--    may one be able to open the closed street?  may one be able to "o=
pen one's eyes"?      In "nature" Emerson writes of finding an "original re=
lation with the universe" as an American project.  (The American of his tim=
e still being considered as seeing the "New World" through "old eyes"--that=
 is, by way of imported tropes--not made from the materials before one--but=
 a storehouse of images to which to refer--and these not being found in the=
 world before one--it seeming a "blank and ruin".  But is not the blank and=
 ruin we see in nature, that which is in our own eye?  asks Emerson.      E=
merson's is a question posed over again in  much more mediated times by Mil=
ler and Smithson.  In a sense it is  a way of finding two things simultaneo=
usly--an opening of the eyes--and an opening of the streets.  This is an  a=
ct of  "first time seeing"--as much as this is possible for a person--and w=
hy a Baudelaire and a Picasso --who says "I  do not seek, I find"--both use=
 childhood and a childlike seeing as the basis for an artist's way of looki=
ng, "childhood rediscovered/recovered"  with the adult artist's use of the =
tools of a discipline--     I think of this work on my own part as "Anarkey=
ology"--working through the "blank and ruin" of as it were over-exposed sit=
e/sight/cite--to find in the rubble and "white outs", blanks, disappearance=
s--the taphonomy of the materials which are literally physically "at hand".=
  "To see/find/hear the ghost of no one"--an anonymity--as a refusal of the=
 naming which turns into claiming.  To find ways in which to see-- is not t=
o name. ("I don't know what the hell the name of thing this thing is/was"--=
)      For in the name--begins the vanishing of seeing and of what is seen-=
-       When it is said "in the beginning was the word"--is not there alrea=
dy an introduction of a form of eradication of the visual?  And, via the vi=
sual being introduced through naming-"let there be light"---is not this alr=
eady a system of control?  Of ownership--"name it and claim it"--         F=
or example--"the material word" which does not function as a reference to a=
 thing--does this "liberate the word"--by making it "abstract"--or does it =
only further enslave it to abstractions?--And by using the word--whether "m=
aterial" or not--the sense that the abstratction turns inside out and "mani=
fests itself" "in the world"--as abstractions, which means to impose on see=
ing--forms of imprisonment--ownership--exchange--and reification--and use s=
eeing as one of the tools of denomination which function as domination--bef=
ore in a sense "seeing" has even begun--because what is "seen" is already n=
amed--if not also already photographed, filed, named, videotaped and filmed=
, labeled and filed--and "the world" becoming ever more a series of "art im=
ages"/travel bureau images  on walls and in brochures and on line--a "confi=
rmation" of your ticket in the sense that you see what you paid for--    (T=
he question of "borders", "Walls/Fences" not to "keep out" only, but as bar=
riers against visibility of the other--in order for them to be "contained" =
or to "vanish" as it were--from the consciousnesses which exist "inside" th=
e borders, walls, fences, etc.  "The interface" which will occur only via "=
screens"--in which a "dialogue" turns into "identification", "targeting",  =
and surveillance.  The barriers make sure that only the "right tourists" wi=
ll visit one's own locale, just as one is screened on the way to one's dest=
ination in others' locales.)      An "aestheticization of the world" and an=
 "aesthetics of disapearance"--also function easily as a pornogrification o=
f the world--and the huge booms in the kidnapping, purchasing, selling of h=
uman bodies to supply an endless parade of the pornografication of every th=
ing that moves, (sex with animals, babies, you name it--and claim it)  and =
when it has stopped moving, a necro-pornografication--the barriers between =
"art  life" becoming "broken down" so that the barriers "between life and d=
eath" can be broken through--and even  the dead become "sex slaves/toys".  =
(The fantasization re the coming "replicants" and androids has begun long b=
efore  their actual appearance--will there become a pornogrification of the=
 "unborn" via their imagery seen on sonagram screens as they develop within=
 the womb?  Leading to an inversion of necrophilia--sex with the unborn-- I=
f there isn't already a "flourishing industry" in this)        With each ne=
w technology of visuality, each new discourse of naming, methodology of nam=
ing, transcription of naming--one is assured that "you are seeing things ne=
ver seen before"--"on screen", "in the world"--"in your imagination"--or--n=
on-imagination to conform with a politically corrected concept---yet at the=
 same time--for each new visuality introduced, how much of the previous is =
eradicated?  The old fashioned palimpsest is superceded by the self-erasing=
 "Etch-a-Sketch" screen, still rather smudgy--and then the "delete" of the =
cyber screen--(which still leaves traces--to be found by cyber sleuths and =
"private eyes"--) A vertigo of voyaging  from "appearance" to "appearance" =
as a form of steadily making a wake of disapparences--"now you see it and n=
ow you don't"--Was what one saw ever there  at all?  "I could no longer tru=
st my own eyes."       If one is to live in the "open street" and move in a=
n open/opening "world"--as Miller and Smitshon write of these--there are th=
e lessons of these to be learned from the relation tof "the artist's way of=
 seeing"with the "art of survival."    The "street" whether of city, desert=
, the arctic, the jungle, forest, "wide open flat plains" has at its most b=
asic  level the question of survival.   To develop seeing--including seeing=
 as ever alert "vigilance"--as "the ghetto stare"--as a kind of guerilla ac=
tivity in the midst of the bombardments of images, words, identifications--=
labels--and disappearnces--is a discipline and  "training" learned each mom=
ent "on the "job" as it were, and via practice ongoing--"the proof of the p=
udding being in the eating"--in that one is not simply surviving, but devel=
oping this "art of looking"/"art of survival" into something more than the =
sums of their parts.       The "breaking down of barriers between art and l=
ife"--seems to be one of the major issues in the discussion (to me at any r=
ate, in which case, forgive me the assumption if it is false in others' cas=
es--)  --this can't be shown by "art", or theory or "living one's life as a=
 work of art" or "the art of living"--for already by positing this in words=
--one creates a situation which cannot be solved via words without remainin=
g just that--words--     "in other words"  "it can't be found there"--     =
  nor can it be found via images which are training one to see in terms of =
their imagery--       "It has to be reinvented" wrote Rimbaud--very much a =
poet of the "age of invention"--or maybe it simply calls out as the "uninve=
nted"-the "de-invented"---which is lying about all over the place, in the m=
idst of superceded, forgotten, obscure, long past obsolescent, rusting, dem=
olished, thrown away, decaying, second and third hand hand-me-downs, dime s=
tore contraptions, flea market bargains, the vast teeming rubble of crap an=
d trash of which the "latest thing" will be part tomorrow--as though all th=
at happens is really a form of "ruin in reverse" (Smithson uses this term, =
which he found in Nabokov)--      In this sense Thoreau's "in wilderness is=
 the refuge of the world"--becomes "in wilderness is the refuse of the worl=
d"--(refuse as trash and refuse as the right to refuse--)--the wilderness i=
tself becoming more and more of a heap of refuse--even as it becomes a refu=
ge--cities of people by the millions living in and on refuse--the junk heap=
s of "health food" and "diet fad" inventions, the garbage dumps of words no=
 longer used or allowed to be used, old terminoligies, vanished slangs--log=
os--slogans--all of it--and the immense floating barges filled with the cas=
t out images--the chemical glows of burning fotos, videos, films, DVDS, CD-=
ROMs, color xerox copies . . .       One is presented with an ever growing =
mountain of garbage, rubble, destruction, real estate busts, foreclosed mor=
tgages, bulldozed villages, poisoned beaches, ghettos, prisons, refugee cam=
ps, displaced populations, walled in populations, kidnapped and smuggled po=
pulations--papparazzi populations--mercenary "contractor" populations--book=
 tour populations, film and art festival populations, celebrities in rehab-=
and-hiding populations . . . image wars of territorial wars . . . thin mode=
ls vs emaciated famine victims--"ravaged beauties losing war with time & ce=
llulite" and the "unexpected beauties of the ravages of war"--   Into all  =
the question of survival erupts and overflows--and as it does so, the walls=
, fences, borders, gated communities, distances, gaps between "rich" and "p=
oor" growing ever greater--a yawning abyss tearing fabrics of existences to=
 shreds--"elegiacally photographed"--"preserved on tape, on film"--"a city =
captured while vanishing literally before our very eyes"--"the last remnant=
s of a people fill these camps with their bodies and the diseases they carr=
y--their only baggage the bacteria eating them alive"--"these momento mori =
signal the endurance of memory"---     The question of the "open street" an=
d "artist's  way of looking" takes place as a form of guerrila activity of =
survival where "barriers between art and life" actually are becoming to be =
seen --written--theorized--assomething which is necessary--(poetry & art  s=
tudied and produced as poetry and art, removed from the tarnishments of con=
texts mired in ideology, society, human muck, the return of the "purifying =
the language of the tribe"--of a purified, cleaned  out  return-to-formalis=
m--)  and the walls are being fostered and raised ever higher--when not so =
long ago there was the desire to tear them down--     The guerilla activity=
 or simply nomidic survival activity--of working in an "open street" and es=
saying learning the disciplines of an "artist's way of seeing"--operate not=
 as the breaking down of this both entirely abstract and overwhelmingly con=
crete barrier created by language, caste, capital, ownership, naming--but a=
s something other, moving in ways fugitive, "unprogrammatic", in between an=
d among--not even "underground"--closer to anonymous--"becoming other" as a=
 "line of flight" which moves not "from point to point" but into the unknow=
n hidden in plain site/sight/cite--the "dark matter" among the galaxies, de=
ad stars, black holes, planets, supernovae, red dwarves, quasars, all the s=
cattered rubble and debris of a Big Bang and it's "music of the spheres" he=
ard also as "radio noise". "background noise"--    "the most beautiful  wor=
ld is a heap of rubble tossed down in confusion"  (in some translations "in=
 confusion" is presented as "at random")--reads one of Heraclitus' survivin=
g fragments    it is in this heap of rubble that are found the lines in str=
ata of "Mother Earth" --"Look under your feet!"--said Chuang Tzu who wasn't=
 sure if he dreamed he was a butterfly or a butterfly who dreamed he was Ch=
uang Tzu--the Way is there--"not to seek, but to find"--and to begin work w=
ith the found--as the limits there are to express the "oceanic conciousness=
" of the endless teeming, streaming, debris----"necessity is the motherfuck=
er of invention"--    Against a totalizing word/image production and reprod=
uction of surveillance, control, barriers, the                             =
emprisoning of the visual to the already seen,  there is not the "totaling"=
 effect of "radical" "transgressive" methods which use the "master's tool t=
o tear down the master's house"--nor the use of game methods--or "recreatio=
n as creation"--but something other to be found in "wreck creation"--not an=
 injunction to "wreck creation"--rather a finding via the motherfucker nece=
ssity the "wreck creation"  all about one--Heraclitus's "most beautiful  wo=
rld" as simultaneously wreck and creation--already--ongoing--        "ruins=
 in reverse"--which rise up to meet the hand reaching in finding them, touc=
hing, rubbing them with crayon on paper----and from opposite sides of the s=
ame paper-- creating with the up rising pressing of the materials--the nota=
tions of this encounter --which creates something other, outside the limits=
 of either of the two separately, but in an overlapping area--something at =
once "inside" and "outside"--a "wreck" and "creation"--something which is n=
ot a totality or totalizing, but ever is  in change--the simulatenous parti=
cles and flows of "wreck creation"--"anarkeyology"--      as a suggestion o=

What an incredible writing. While I was reading this almost inexaustible
flow of words my associations went back to Roland Barthes' The Death of the
Author. There are several extracts online.
As a note, here is where Henry James resided in Venice:
http://www.stanford.edu/~evans/Venice/
right in the center and on the top floor in summer, I wonder how he could
work/write, even think.

How you got from Godard to "God-art" is a marvel on its own. The origin
could be for example goder (godant): to fold.

Subject:      Muybridge A/D
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Muybridge A/D


Muybridge is Muybridge's dirty little secret.

Scanning the real in this case is a form of devouring.

The intense sexuality of some of the images contaminates the others.

Men and women do sports, women do narrative, flirt, kiss.

Men and women haul things up and down the obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Some women have shaved is not equivalent to some men have erections.

The analogic digital is transformed into the digital analogic through
abjection.

Modernism is in a neutral face going back farther than Daguerre.

In Muybridge smiles break through in an engagement with ... the camera.
Some of the plates seems smeared in some of the images, indicative of
a relative inattention to purity.

The digital is a construct of Muybridgian innovation which cannot keep
dust, poor development, dirt, out of the image.

Men and women are never posed together; men are posed with men and women
with women.

Neither men nor women have spread legs or other in/attentive views.

Shaved and erect, the viewer is drawn to the gridwork of the fetishized.

The woman with her hand between her legs is startled into what:
"Turning around in surprise and running away."

Uneasy arousal of abject and packaged death, therefore sublime.

Measurement/tolerance of Muybridgian intervals in contradistinction to
the unique characteristics of each image; development changes from one
plate to another; from one part of an image to another; from one part of
the plate to another. Smears spill, decathect boundaries; in these
primordial artifacts of the digital age, corrosion immediately set.

As in pornography, the authenticity of the image is guaranteed by their
snapshot-like quality in relation to formal framing (of bodies, movements,
desire).

"Stripped of all identity," thus women against men, but here in these
images as otherwise evidence.

Then within these images, lack of title, frame, enumeration.

What remains is what remains within any digital: a dream of measurement.

Measurement itself is always otherwise.

What you measure is torn within me.

The whole world speaks (is measured) between one's legs.

Muybridge, the technicians, the models: and here is someone erect.

The apparatus is the inverse of the panopticon: here, the viewer surrounds
the viewed.

{ This is not film. This is not nineteenth century. This is Muybridge.

This is not Muybridge. This is the deconstruction of media before media.
This is not deconstruction. }

Kissing, not fucking: everything concentrated to break concentration.

Someone says "Go" or "Start."

My hands are trembling; it's almost impossible to find the images again;
it's as if the book itself becomes a body, the smell of the page; darkness
where the legs meet.

The signs of the shaved or erect are outward, emblems, of interior states
and the secret holes of the body.

The abject-analogic contradicts, forecloses the measurement of the body.

One can only imagine drives skittering from image to image.

The images refuse their order, their accountancy; instead, what is
revealed, what sort of revelation, where does the body's desire twist to
the breaking point?

It's like this: the developer spews across the plate in its entirety.

Or this: one's hands trembling in the darkroom.

Or this: the grid-place Cartesian dream of a body splayed across time
and four spatial dimensions (the body opened and open, mathesis!) - this
laboratory, scene, stage, now emptied. Night carries its own silence.
Someone trembled swallowing the image.

If these are measurements, they're analogic; separated, one from another,
joined by tissue, joined by skin. The slightest movement registers - the
tilt and wobble of the ass (which is conjoined by its own apparatus
indicating degrees from the horizontal, suspiciously like a harass), the
rise of the penis, anything but speech. And so difficult to see the face.
But a surplus which is not punctum, which spews neitherness, something or
other inconsequential, an escape job.

An escape job because it is in the practice of this signifying that
signifying disappears. The signifying is the virtual; we have always been
virtual. What one witnesses in Muybridge beyond the formality (not form-
alism) of the grid is the imaginary. This is not the birth of the
imaginary, but its appearance at the chiasm of photography and motility:
photographic motility, the motility of the image. But of course the image
does nothing, means nothing, it's waiting for you. It's waiting for your
birth and your imaginary. But of course, it's not waiting.

Indigo Blue  - Erasing Words With Ann Hamilton (Sculptor & Installation
Artist) at San Francisco Museum of Art

...The installation has already been up for a few weeks, and the previous
workers have erased several pages. For reasons unknown to me, the book is
being erased from back to front - almost as if the process is to make us
work backwards to the point of the books inception. Some of the pages are
perforated with holes from workers who have been too aggressive. The
assistant curator has sent out an in an email message warning up to be
gentle with our strokes across the page. Indeed, the type on the pages is
variously visible, but definitely unreadable...

Mom - Critic and Poet

Friday evening I took to reading some poems to my mom - some Jack Spicer,
Denise Levertov and Allen Ginsberg. Previously I have been astonished by
some of the things she has had to say about pieces from Gertrude Stein=B9s
Tender Buttons and poems in Kenneth Rextroth=B9s Love And The Turning Year:
100 More Poems From the Chinese. Her manner is to listen closely, and then,
when I ask about the poems meaning, to make an authoritative take on her
sense of what she has heard..

Enjoy, and comments appreciated,

Seems to me that DIY is key too in translating the poetry from page to world, as the book is the interface.  I'm often surprised that more poets aren't more involved with the physical presentation of the book itself once the page work is done, and that this is an essential part of much poetry--especially poetry that seeks to foreground the physicality/materiality of its word & language--why stop once it's sitting on the on the page just so?

Luke makes a good point. Some times my wife and I will make books just for =
the hell of it and distribute them to everyone we know. The pro side of pub=
lishing with a good press is that they'll have wide distribution. But if th=
e poet is a civilian, s/he will no doubt want to be part of that disseminat=
ion. I'd like the poet to hand me a book she made of her poems. Meaningful =
doesn't even begin to describe the sentiment. Trust.

Yes, Ezra's expensive "capers" - especially those inorganic ones in the
political arena are still quite well-known, particularly courtesy of
certain, embarrassingly 'full disclosures'. Still, quite amazing the 'roots'
he planted that still hold in the language, poetry that is.

One question, Miekal. What kind of dogs are permitted inside Ezra's Pound,
and are they spayed?  (Ouch!)

Sliced, ripe Mangos go terrific with homemade organic Ginger ice cream.
Cheaper than drugs! There is a place, The Creamery, that sells the Ice Cream
on 18th Street, below Dolores in San Francisco. And the mangoes are that not
hard to find.

The Green Lantern Gallery and Press in Chicago is a wondeful place that put=
s on many phenomenal events and art exhibitions.  In addition, however, the=
y also put out a monthly newsletter (soon to go on-line) and print a few bo=
oks each year.  The books are hand bound and printed with silk-screen cover=
s.  The runs are about 500 to 1500.  It is a marvelous place/press that eve=
ryone should know about.

I missed some messages on this thread but hope someone mentioned Kyle
Schlesinger's Cuneiform Press. I'm also drawn to books that are very simple
and not necessarily handcrafted but still have an elegance (better if
understated) about them. Lately I've found Rod Mengham's chapbooks from
Equipage fit that bill very well. And I was much impressed by the quality
of a lot of French presses on a just-completed visit to Paris. I'm looking
forward to more fully unpacking and reading the books I picked up while there.

KAURAB Translation Site

http://www.kaurab.com/english/



Kaurab is a Bangla (col. Bengali) literary magazine published from
Jamshedpur, an east-Indian steel town, since 1970. The core members of
Kaurab are poets and writers whose work represents an interesting break with
earlier traditions of literary writing in Bangla. Kaurab's entry into the
Bangla literary context was at a crucial juncture when mainstream Bangla
literature was in the thrall of the social, political and cultural upheavals
precipitated by the Naxalite (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naxalite )
movement.



While Kaurab, as a literary group, had a cameraderie with the Hungrialist
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_generation  ) and New Generation
writers of Bengal, it largely attempted to accentuate a fresh and marginal
voice that was unheard in Bangla literature. Being a Bangla literary
magazine published from outside of Bengal (from Jamshedpur, Jharkhand,
erstwhile Bihar), Kaurab had an outside-in identity, which it shaped and
reshaped over the years with much ingenuity. This group of poet/writers, led
by Kamal Chakraborty, Swadesh Sen, Barin Ghosal, Debajyoti Dutta and Shankar
Lahiri, despite their apparent urbanity, invested deeply in making
connections with the emerging industrial culture (Jamshedpur was the hub of
industrial activity) of a small town gradually transforming itself into a
city, and the surrounding hinterland, rich in adivasi (native tribal)
cultural traditions. In fact, their urbanity itself was intricately layered
- never quite the Kolkata (col. Calcutta) urban though retaining strong
creative links with its literary production, the lived memories of the Tata
steel furnaces and the robust energies of changing adivasi languages and
cultures......

Frugal Traveler | American Road Trip :

Into Middle America but Staying on the Fringe

By MATT GROSS
Published: June 20, 2007

http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/06/20/travel/20frugal.html?pagewanted=3Dall=


DRIVING the back roads, you sometimes cross state borders =20
unknowingly. Without the enormous =93Welcome to ...!=94 signs you see on =
=20
the Interstates, all you have to identify your new surroundings are =20
subtle clues in the landscape =97 knobbier pine trees, say, or highways =20=

named for local heroes.

Wisconsin, however, announced itself with no such subtlety. After a =20
weekend in Chicago, I=92d driven west across Illinois, finally turning =20=

north amid the big estates near Forreston. Once I was over the state =20
line, hills swelled up from the prairie, the sweet smell of manure =20
wafted from dairy farms, and advertisements urged me to indulge in =20
Cheddar cheese and frozen custard, bratwurst and ButterBurgers.

By the time I drove through New Glarus =97 a surreal town modeled on a =20=

Swiss village complete with chalet-style buildings and street signs =20
in German =97 I knew I hadn=92t simply entered a new state, but a new =20=

state of mind.

As culturally distinct as Wisconsin is, I was heading for a place =20
that sat at yet another remove from mainstream America: Dreamtime =20
Village, an intentional community of artists situated in the =20
driftless hills of southwest Wisconsin (so called because they =20
escaped the rough, cold touch of ice age glaciers).

Once known as communes, until the word became overly associated with =20
hippies and other cultural relics of the 1960s and =9270s, intentional =20=

communities have a long history in this country, going back to the =20
Shakers and even, I suppose, the Pilgrims. I=92d long wanted to visit =20=

one, to see how utopian ideals were surviving in the more cynical =20
America of today, and so I logged on to www.ic.org and searched for =20
intentional communities in Wisconsin and Iowa. At first, I found what =20=

I had expected: devout Christians, pagan farmers and a polyamorous =20
=93family=94 (my wife, Jean, vetoed that one). Almost all, however, =20
wanted serious members, not casual visitors like me.

But for $8 a day and the understanding that I would put my meager =20
skills to work in the community, Dreamtime Village (10375 County =20
Highway A, West Lima; 608-625-4619; www.dreamtimevillage.org) was =20
willing to have me. I didn=92t know what I would find there: men =20
wearing burlap sacks? an all-groundnut menu? But last Wednesday =20
evening, after following ever-smaller county roads as they arced up, =20
down and around the hills, the Volvo climbed one final ridgetop and =20
arrived in the middle of nowhere =97 the tiny village of West Lima =20
(population 65, or so).

A century ago, West Lima was thriving. But as the economy changed, =20
its citizens relocated, and by 1990 the public school and the post =20
office lay empty, and the gas station and hat shop were fading =20
memories. Then mIEKAL aND and Elizabeth Was =97 artists, as you can =20
tell by the wacky names =97 showed up from Madison and founded a =20
=93hypermedia permaculture eco-village,=94 in other words, a small, =20
sustainable farm where they and other like-minded individuals could =20
create art and music. On 80-odd acres donated by an eccentric =20
benefactor, Dreamtime Village grew to 25 members and became a fixture =20=

on the anarchist circuit, attracting visitors like the doctor-clown =20
Patch Adams and the writer Daniel Pinchbeck.

When I got there, mIEKAL was standing in West Lima=92s main =20
intersection, and the sun was warming the town=92s sole remaining =20
business, a Pepsi machine (50 cents a can). Bright-eyed and sporting =20
a bushy mustache, he greeted me, expressing surprise that I=92d =20
actually come. A lot of people, he said, get cold feet, apparently =20
put off by the idea of an intentional community.
Video
More Video =BB

But from what I could see, Dreamtime=92s residents were pretty normal: =20=

mIEKAL=92s 19-year-old son, Zon, had just graduated from the Waldorf =20
School in Viroqua, a couple of towns west; Camille, whom mIEKAL had =20
married after he and Elizabeth divorced, was a cheerful, inquisitive =20
filmmaker who had moved there from Romania only a few years earlier =20
(Elizabeth, who had renamed herself Lyx Ish, died in 2004); and Ken, =20
a handyman who=92d been in West Lima longer than anyone, was quieter =20
than the others but so what.

At first, I couldn=92t quite see how they constituted a community. =20
Camille and mIEKAL lived in the P.O., the town=92s former post office, =20=

while Zon, Ken and I had bedrooms in the rickety wood-frame hotel (it =20=

had been the teachers=92 hotel back when the public school was open). =20=

Apparently, another person, Kirk, lived on a far-flung piece of =20
property, but he and I never even met.

All seemed to be on their own trajectories. Zon slept till noon, and =20
mIEKAL worked days as the Web master for the food distributor Organic =20=

Valley, based nearby in La Farge. Camille tended to her pet parrots =20
and film projects. Ken was often parked in front of his computer (we =20
had dial-up Internet at the hotel, wireless DSL at the P.O.). No one =20
seemed to share meals. It hardly felt communal.

Nor was the community particularly isolated. To the west is a big =20
park, the Kickapoo Valley Reserve, and to the south is Taliesin, =20
Frank Lloyd Wright=92s home and school (www.taliesinpreservation.org). =20=

Between West Lima and these obvious tourist destinations were dozens =20
of the swooping, swerving roads that I longed to cruise. (=93Nothing =20
picks you up in its arms and so gently, almost lovingly, cradles you =20
as do these southwestern Wisconsin hills,=94 Wright had written.)

The Volvo, however, had been leaking coolant badly, and I was afraid =20
to take it out for long. At a reader=92s suggestion, I=92d mentioned the =
=20
issue on www.brickboard.com, but still didn=92t know where to take the =20=

car for service.

Instead, I quashed my restlessness and tried to adapt to Dreamtime=92s =20=

rhythms. The heat meant no gardening until late afternoon, so I spent =20=

the day reading a Chinese mystery novel, picnicking among the 19th-=20
century tombstones of the West Lima cemetery =97 I=92d spent almost $20 =20=

on rye bread, aged Cheddar and weiss beer in New Glarus =97 and =20
chatting with whoever happened to pass by. Camille showed me the =20
visual poetry zine she and mIEKAL had just published, I shared my =20
beers with the quiet Ken, and Zon told me about a run-in with =20
neighbor kids when he was 9.

=93 =91Hey,=92 he said they=92d asked him, not realizing he was a =
Dreamtimer, =20
=91so have you met the Satan-worshipers who live over there? They =20
sacrifice virgin animals to Satan!=92 =94

=93 =91Oh, really,=92 Zon said he=92d responded with a smile, =91how =
does that =20
work?=92 =94

And around 7 o=92clock, we would all migrate toward the gardens. I=92d =20=

rake grass clipping to use as mulch or spray garlic water on eggplant =20=

leaves to keep bugs away, and mIEKAL would tend baby plants in the =20
greenhouse. Margarita, the pet goose, would nip at Camille=92s leg, and =20=

the whine of the lathe would echo from Ken=92s woodshop. We were each =20=

in our own orbit =97 I was still preparing my own dinner, penne in a =20
tomato sauce made with ingredients from the garden =97 but I was =20
starting to sense the gravitational forces that drew us individuals =20
together.

On Friday morning, mIEKAL took me to Organic Valley =20
(www.organicvalley.coop) for a tour of the offices. The building was =20
impressively green (for insulation, it used old jeans), but more =20
astounding was the size of the operation: more than 300 employees and =20=

a network of organic growers stretching from southwestern Wisconsin =20
to Maine, Florida and California. Suddenly, mIEKAL=92s devotion to =20
permaculture and organic living didn=92t seem so oddball, but more like =20=

the crest of a rising wave.

After the tour, we ate lunch in the cafeteria (organic meals for $5 a =20=

pound) with Daisy, a young woman who=92d once hitchhiked across the =20
country. As we chatted about travel, I mentioned my car troubles, and =20=

she asked, =93Why don=92t you take it to Paul, the guy who fixes =
Volvos?=94

Why not indeed? With mIEKAL kindly escorting me, I took the car to =20
Paul Schlicht of Schlicht Automotive (741 South Main Street, Viroqua; =20=

608-637-6766), who quickly diagnosed the problem. The heater core =20
hoses had ruptured from rubbing the dipstick. Because he knew I was =20
in a hurry, Paul agreed to fix it by Saturday morning.

As Paul tinkered, his friends sat around drinking beer while heavy =20
metal played on the radio. =93This is your truest Wisconsin =20
experience,=94 mIEKAL said, =93hanging out in an auto garage in the =20
middle of nowhere.=94

Back in West Lima, mIEKAL, Camille and I spent the afternoon drinking =20=

homemade plum wine and talking about an odd cemetery in Romania, =20
Zon=92s future and how the once-reclusive Ken had slowly opened up. =20
Occasionally, a horse and buggy would clip-clop down the road, a =20
reminder that Amish farmers, too, had found the driftless hills a =20
perfect fit for their own intentional communities. Then, at last, we =20
ate dinner together =97 a weirdly good stir-fry of organic hot dogs and =20=

mushrooms over saffron rice, with a fresh spinach salad from the =20
garden =97 and I returned to my breezy corner bedroom.

The next morning, I knew, I would be leaving West Lima to visit =20
Taliesin, itself an experiment in living closer to nature, then drive =20=

west to Decorah, the reader-recommended heart of Norwegian-American =20
Iowa. And for a moment, I felt terrible. In these few days, I=92d just =20=

begun to find my place in Dreamtime Village, and now I was abandoning =20=

it. But community, I=92d learned, exists independent of geography, and =20=

the bonds that linked me to these not-so-isolated dreamers would =20
stretch across the hills of Wisconsin and beyond. Margarita the goose =20=

clucked out in the yard; my cellphone, with no signal, lay dormant on =20=

the nightstand; and I fell soundly asleep.

It would be great to hear more about interesting presses at work today in France. When you get a chance, Charles, would you expand on this?

mIEKAL, This is quite beautiful and poetic; I think a lot of people I know
would like to live this way. But we're caught up in an electronic web on
one hand and a desire perhaps for annihilation on the other; I could throw
away my cellphone but then I'd also like to disappear forever. - love,
Alan, and where do you get the zine?

means either to be killed or in love. Love and death meet in the word.

Barry,

first I was very impressed by the general quality of literary books in=20
Paris. Paperback books are generally sewn, printed on high quality paper,=20
and expertly printed (registration, consistency, etc.) with good design and=
=20
a graceful sense of page layout. A good example is PO=C9SIES: Oeuvres=20
Compl=E8tes de Mohammed Dib, introduced & edited by Habib Tengour (himself a=
=20
terrific poet), which is massive at almost 600 pages, and is an important=20
book by a poet I hope becomes available in such an edition in English (this=
=20
one is in French), and not a "fine art" book at all, but still a lovely=20
graceful book that is a pleasure to handle even at its size.

In terms of smaller presses, I picked up a visually delightful book with=20
text by Nicole Malinconi and images by Jean-Gilles Badaire titled La Porte=
=20
de C=E9zanne, published by &esperlu=E8te editions, which is not in France=
 but=20

chapbook in terms of number of pages) by Sarah Riggs, translated into=20
French and published by =C9ditions de l'Attente, titled 28 t=E9l=E9grammes.=
 And I=20
saw a couple of books from Minute Editions which looked really good. I=20
looked in a bookstore for the one by Frederic Forte but could not find it.=

I also like the books coming out from La Presse, which is bringing out=20
French poets in English. One particularly great one from that press is=20
Wolftrot, by Marie Borel.

I saw many more books in bookstores but didn't note all the press names and=

And I might have said that Rod Mengham's Equipage books are published by=20

Barry,

I think I was confused about a title and press name in the last message I=20
sent, and that the Fr=E9d=E9ric Forte title I was referring to was one of=

Hello My Friends,

John Cutrone here, from Convivio Bookworks in Lake Worth, Florida.
It's the solstice on Wednesday, the beginning of summer by the
almanac, Midsummer by older traditions of time. An auspicious time
to  be sure. And tonight, Midsummer's Eve, a meaningful night to send
a  new project out into the world.

WORKS on PAPER
by Shin Yu Pai

Seth and I are pleased to announce the release of Works on Paper,
our  newest limited edition book, printed letterpress by hand on
kozo  papers using our Vandercook 4 Proof Press. The poems are
presented in  four distinct cycles; we guide you through each cycle
with endsheets  of handmade Moriki paper in earthbound colors. The
book itself is  sewn on a concertina of handmade Fabriano Roma paper,
then bound in  boards wrapped in Kumoi paper that is printed with
beeswax and dyed  in kakishibu--a traditional Japanese dye made from
fermented  persimmons. 125 copies were printed.

We find Shin Yu's poetry striking, haunting, fun. Beautiful in its
simplicity. This collection of her work has paper and ritual as its
theme: how paper is made, how paper is used. Paper as surface, paper
in spirit. We have attempted, as best we can, to treat the poems
with  this in mind, and the book is designed with paper acting as
medium,  as guide, and as binding. We've chosen Eric Gill's Perpetua
as the  typeface.

And so on this summer night, we're happy to share this new work with
you:


http://www.conviviobookworks.com


 From our homepage, click the "Our Catalog" link, then "Letterpress
Books." This one, we think, is a pretty special piece. Let us know
what you think. We'll begin shipping Works on Paper next week.

So, goodnight unto you all.

John

"Thank you, and write when you can."

Inspired goods from around the globe and close to home...

Kenning Editions is pleased to announce that its new and hopefully permanen=
t home is Chicago, IL.  We=E2=80=99re celebrating this move with a brand ne=
w subscription offer, available at www.kenningeditions.com =20

By entering your subscription, you receive our two forthcoming titles at a =
steep discount, as well as supporting our efforts to make important new wri=
ting available.  Next on our list (and due off the press this fall) is sexo=
PUROsexoVELOZ Septiembre / a bilingual edition of books two and three of Do=
lores Dorantes, by Dolores Dorantes / translated by Jen Hofer and published=
 with Counterpath Press / 978-0-9767364-2-4 / $14.95=20

Dolores Dorantes was born in Veracruz in 1973 and has lived most of her lif=
e in Ciudad Ju=C3=A1rez, where socioeconomic violence and politically-charg=
ed daily brutalities have informed her radically humane and beautifully inc=
isive work as a poet, journalist, and cultural worker. Dorantes is a rare p=
henomenon among Mexican literary communities, in that she engages a wide-ra=
nging international stance toward poetry and poetics while refusing to acce=
pt state support from a government she cannot respect. She has published fo=
ur book-length works of poetry, and is a founding member of the border arts=
 collective Compa=C3=B1=C3=ADa Frugal (The Frugal Company), which counts am=
ong its activities publication of the monthly poetry broadside series Hoja =
Frugal, printed in editions of 4000 and distributed free throughout Mexico.=
 Regarding that publication, Dorantes writes: =E2=80=9CThe Hoja Frugal is a=
 project that came into being on September 9, 2001 in Ciudad Ju=C3=A1rez, C=
hihuahua (the so-called =E2=80=9Ccrime frontier=E2=80=9D). Our idea was to =
share the readings and translations in which we as writers are engaged. But=
 more than anything, to share them with the community as a whole, not with =
the =E2=80=98intellectual=E2=80=99 community. Our intention was to give the=
 community a breath of respite in the context of the growing phenomenon of =
violence we experience daily in this border zone.=E2=80=9D Engaging this li=
terary-political project from another perspective, PUREsexSWIFTsex and Sept=
ember are books 2 and 3 of Dorantes=E2=80=99 lifelong project titled Dolore=
s Dorantes. Simultaneously a breath of respite and a galvanizing wind, thes=
e works consist of fragmented interlocking sequences of poems that explore =
the divided yet overlapping territories of self and other, memory and loss,=
 past and possibility.=20

Jen Hofer=E2=80=99s translations of Dorantes=E2=80=99 work have appeared in=
 the anthologies Sin puertas visibles: An Anthology of Contemporary Poetry =
by Mexican Women (ed. Jen Hofer, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2003) and =
War and Peace 2 (ed. Judith Goldman and Leslie Scalapino, O Books, 2005), a=
nd in the literary journals Action, Yes (issue #2), Aufgabe (ed. Tracy Grin=
nell, issue #3), and Kenning (ed. Patrick Durgin, issue 13, 2002), and as a=
 Seeing Eye chapbook (ed. Guy Bennett, 2004). New translations are forthcom=
ing in Achiote and Tampa Review.

World Premiere of “The Houses At Falling Hanging,” a newly-discovered work
by famed poet Frank O’ Hara, as well as plays by Gertrude Stein, Edna St.
Vincent Millay and others. Directed by Obie-winner BARBARA VANN, “Frank &
Stein and Friends” runs from June 14th though the 30th with an opening
scheduled for Friday, June 22nd at

THE MEDICINE SHOW THEATRE
549 West 52nd St., 3rd Floor
(between 10th and 11th Ave.)

The performance schedule is Thursdays through Saturdays at 8:00 PM and

“FRANK & STEIN AND FRIENDS” celebrates the short verse play by showcasing
new and old works by both classic and contemporary voices. The centerpiece
of the evening is the world premiere of “The Houses At Falling Hanging,” an
unproduced 1953 play by acclaimed poet Frank O’ Hara about a cheery cocktail
party in a house dangerously close to slipping off the edge of a cliff, that
was considered lost until its discovery at Harvard’s Houghton Library.

Other works in the evening include Gertrude Stein’s “In The Garden,” Edna
St. Vincent Millay’s “Aria De Capo,” and newer works by contemporary poets
such as Simon Pettet, Denise Duhamel, Tom Savage and Gary Sullivan.

Subject:      Filtering and Analog Digital
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Filtering and Analog Digital


Reworked from a 1978 Toronto Notebook, "On the successive eliminations of
the entity in transformations"

or rather all that is necessary from the diagrams

a -> a' -> a" f' f

The function f moves a to a'; f' moves a' to a" and of course there is a
composition f'f(a) -> a" or some such. a' disappears as an entity, and on
might generalize, considering a series of functions f, f', f", f"' ...
such that (f"'f"f'f(z)) is a filter over z. In the lifeworld, f^n
extends in either direction, i.e. n ranges over the integers at the least.

In reality, n ranges over the continuum. Every entity z carries its filter
and a filter is non-existent without an entity. The continuous transform-
ation of the entity is defined by the filter and vice-versa. Since z may
split in the process, the filter may split. The series f... need not
define any particular entity, but may be considered split from a previous
series, i.e. one out of an almost infinite number of processes, infinite
in relation to the continuum. In this fashion, the worlding process is
visible, the entity disappears, as entities do. Entities are named in any
case in relation to space-time; too great a dispersion, and "entity"
disappears qua entity; the background microwave radiation of the universe
is an example. Too small a dispersion, virtual particles for example, and
"entity" is ontologically problematic. Within everyday life, water and
other liquids, as well as gases, are not considered entities, while glass,
also liquid, is. It's a question of a family of usages in relation to
viscosity for example. There is also a notion of intrinsic identity based
on communality and communication; humans are entities, although rapidly
undergoing decomposition. Reichenbach's genidentity is useful here; it
references the actual material substrate of a coherent object, held gene-
alogically together over a substantial period of time, and undergoing
change qua object. Such an object brings human phenomenology with it;
objects out-gas, wear, wear-out, dissolve, split, from what might tempor-
arily be considered an origin, their inhering to a presumably created
form. All origins and all endpoints are subject to filtering, which
dissolves them as such. One is left with continuous birthing, continuous
languaging and worlding, processes related to Bohm's implicate order on
one hand and maya on the other. Of course the filtering itself is
filtered, there is no end to it. To be human is to attempt to halt such,
impede what is identified as dissolution, death, permanent impediment.

Ownership arises out of this, as does the urge to collect, related to the
urge to hunt, to permanently annihilate, absorb, be reborn in the blood of
the other. To stay with the filter is to remain analogic, deeply human,
chthonic; to impede is to construct the digital, build, aerate, delude.
The digital is always already inauthentic, Vaihinger's as-if which resides
for and in the moment. Culture veers among the various orders, as if the
world and its history is ordered and orderly; it is the sympathetic, not
empathetic, magic of this that allows us to survive.

Hey everyone -  I have been busy lately, overwhelmed--  visionless!  It's
summer time.

This morning I was watching the Sesame Street 25th Anniversary DVD (all by
myself in my study, in case you were wondering) and found the encouragement
I needed in the Alligator King song.  I had forgotten all about it.

I'll post the poem below -- The video itself is on my blog -
http://belz.wordpress.com


One two three four five six seven!

Said the Alligator King to his seven sons,
"I'm feelin' mighty down.
Whichever of you can cheer me up
Will get to wear my crown."

His first son brought seven oyster pearls
From the bottom of the China Sea.
The second gave him seven statues of girls
With clocks where their stomachs should be.

The third son gave him seven rubies
From the sheikdom of Down There Beneath.
The King thought the rubies were cherries,
And he broke off seven of his teeth.

The fourth son tried to cheer him up
With seven lemon drops.
The King said, "I'm sorry son,
Since that ruby episode, I just haven't got the chops."

The fifth son brought the King perfume
In seven fancy silver jars;
The King took a whiff, and he broke out in spots
'Cause it smelled like cheap cigars.

The sixth son gave him seven diamond rings
To wear upon his toes.
The King snagged his foot on the royal red rug
And crumpled up his nose.

The seventh son of the Alligator King
Was a thoughtful little whelp.
He said, "Daddy, appears to me
That you could use a little help."

Said the Alligator King to his seventh son,
"My son, you win the crown.
You didn't bring me diamonds or rubies, but
You helped me up when I was down.

Take the crown; it's yours, my son.
I hope you don't mind the dents.
I got it on sale at a discount store-
Cost me all of seven cents!"

Seven!

I don't even have to look at the video: this brings back an early body
memory from my childhood: the point where the Alligator King bites the
rubies and loses his teeth affected me deeply as a little kid: something
about the red of the rubies, the imagined feeling of biting into hard
stones and losing teeth, the sucked-in gums ... not that I was disturbed
by this little short, but I still know what I thought the rubies might
taste like as I put them in my mouth.=20

I'll post the poem below -- The video itself is on my blog -
http://belz.wordpress.com


One two three four five six seven!

Said the Alligator King to his seven sons,
"I'm feelin' mighty down.
Whichever of you can cheer me up
Will get to wear my crown."

His first son brought seven oyster pearls
From the bottom of the China Sea.
The second gave him seven statues of girls
With clocks where their stomachs should be.

The third son gave him seven rubies
From the sheikdom of Down There Beneath.
The King thought the rubies were cherries,
And he broke off seven of his teeth.

The fourth son tried to cheer him up
With seven lemon drops.
The King said, "I'm sorry son,
Since that ruby episode, I just haven't got the chops."

The fifth son brought the King perfume
In seven fancy silver jars;
The King took a whiff, and he broke out in spots
'Cause it smelled like cheap cigars.

The sixth son gave him seven diamond rings
To wear upon his toes.
The King snagged his foot on the royal red rug
And crumpled up his nose.

The seventh son of the Alligator King
Was a thoughtful little whelp.
He said, "Daddy, appears to me
That you could use a little help."

Said the Alligator King to his seventh son,
"My son, you win the crown.
You didn't bring me diamonds or rubies, but
You helped me up when I was down.

Take the crown; it's yours, my son.
I hope you don't mind the dents.
I got it on sale at a discount store-
Cost me all of seven cents!"

Seven!=20

Last summer I wrote to the Poetics Listserv. in a condition of poverty --
not yet would I sell my mother's candlesticks -- but I sold books (a box of
hardcovers for $11).  This summer, I'm relatively at ease and feeling  cautious.
I duly paid ARC (Circa Poetry) a remainder of $53.42 for my copy  of the
hardcover, TOUCH OF TOMORROW, in which my poem, "Florence's Weekend,"  appeared on
the first page three years ago, courtesy of the International  Library of
Poetry.  This is not some secret vanity operation:  this is  the real thing, a
real vanity poem.  Now paid in full.   AMB

Dear List:

For those of you in or near Los Angeles, California:

Please join us to celebrate the poetry and the person of Los Angeleno =
poet Ara Shirinyan next Tuesday night at Late Night Snack, curated by =
Harold Abromowitz and Mathew Timmons. Ara has put tremendous energy and =
vitality into the diverse and exciting writing landscape of Los Angeles =
and made important contributions to national and international writing =
communities through his work editing Make Now Press. His poetry echoes =
that same spirit of intellectual rigor, formal experiment and deep play. =
We hope you'll join us to celebrate the publication of his first =
full-length collection of poems:

SYRIA IS IN THE WORLD
Late Night Snack, Tuesday, June 26, 2007
at Beta-Level
Chinatown, Los Angeles, 9:30PM
Here is some information about the book, currently available direct from =
the publisher at www.palmpress.org Copies will also be available at the =
reading.

At globalizing his art, Ara Shirinyan beats Walt Disney hands down. In =
this dazzling debut, Shirinyan takes post-conceptual poetics to new =
borders beyond the scope of US pop culture and media, and into the =
purloined hills and desserts of any language as English, as fodder for =
reframing: "vulgar ideas, cultural purity, nation, etc." This is a =
terrain where "striktly confidentially" gulags share the global stage =
with a long list of Soviet poet blurbs. In the end, Shirinyan reminds =
us: "You have an interest in history. You cannot miss Syria. Syria has =
monuments." Indeed, Syria Is in the World, and so is Ara Shirinyan... =
welcome aboard!--Robert Fitterman

An investigative poetic excavation of nationalism and its many guises, =
SYRIA IS IN THE WORLD is a work thick with political history flung =
through the filter of poetic perspicacity and linguistic audacity. =
Smart, snappy, and incisive, this book is a joyride of re-appropriated =
language, an unflagging examination of flags, a procedurally constrained =
yet unfettered gambit. Ara Shirinyan presses us to question the mundane, =
often arbitrary borders that separate countries from each other and us =
from us.--Jules Boykoff

What is the shape of the sound as it transcends the rectilinearity of =
official language? Does it mask out the hard angles or does it ooze =
beneath and compromise the structure itself?=20

... isosceles overlapping excess of limit
dove, anger-frames
white man equality rectangle
consent system arms covering small flag tree...

What voice can escape the intense entropy in which "a medal is =
arrogantly shaped like a medal"? It's a voice calling a country a =
"perpetual country on my back." With humor and humanity, Ara Shirinyan =
writes his way through power's symbols, so that:

All possible individual personalities in human beings hold
in possession one more than one areas set aside...
--Diane Ward

Ara Shirinyan's SYRIA IS IN THE WORLD collects five related sequences of =
conceptual works, including Republic of Georgia poems, Russia/Soviet =
poems, Poems from Here to There, Flag poems, and the eponymous Republic =
of Syria poems. These works extend the tradition of post-original or =
"sampled" poetry to consider questions of geopolitics and international =
intelligibility, questions of who is talking to who and who can hear =
what.   Drawing on a vast range of source materials, which he =
manipulates either subtly or outrageously, Shirinyan shares essential =
information, even as he comments on the ways this information has =
been/must be translated, coded, recoded, and distributed.   Shirinyan =
communicates with, at, next to, or around us in an attempt to simulate =
mastery of the Babel of world politics and world ideologies.  This is a =
poetry aware of the fact that we can never encompass the world's =
conceptual and ideological diversity, and yet must not be satisfied with =
a narrow local view.   Furiously opposed to the mandarins of =
globalization and their attempt to flatten out or smooth over cultural =
differences, Shirinyan puts his ear out to the Earth, creating a poetry =
of collection, transcription, and reinscription.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Happy to see the write-up on And's community (and the fading sign on the
mailbox!--so goes the avant-garde!), but during the video a statement
sailed past me that I want to verify:  Miekal is doing some visual
poetry using the Micmac glyphs, which he mentioned as the oldest writing
system in North America.  My understanding is that Cherokee is the
oldest documented indigenous Native American writing system in North
America.  Micmac appears to have originally been a mnemonic device that
was then revamped by the Jesuits as  a teaching aid--therefore it's
been altered at the whim of those fellows from over the sea, and
scholars actually don't know by how much.  Cherokee was the product of
the lone genius Sequoya--a remarkable feat only equalled by Kobo Daishi
in Japan, who might have developed the kana.

Cherokee is very much like the Japanese Katakana syllabary.  My students
pick it up in a matter of twenty minutes and use it for a "fun" way of
writing Japanese!  Jess

Here are three links worth following.

Most will have seen this already, I imagine, but I thought I'd point it out,
not only because it is excellent, but because of its relation with a thread
on this list not long ago concerning the book 'The Cult of the Amateur'.
Frontline (aired on the Public Broadcasting System in the USA) has produced
an excellent series called 'News War' at
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newswar . You can view the whole
series online.

This is a four-part TV series that looks at 'journalism in crisis'. The
first part looks at 'Plamegate', where USAmerican reporters were subpoenaed
and imprisoned who reported on WMD (the lack thereof) issues leading up to
the Iraq war (they wouldn't reveal sources). The second part looks at the
clash between the Bush administration and the New York Times' reporting on
NSA wire-tapping of USAmerican citizens suspected of terrorist involvement;
the third part looks at the proliferation of types of news-reportage more
entertainment-oriented than the sort of public-service reportage associated
with 'serious news' and at The Los Angeles Times and its problems as a
microcosm of the problems afflicting USAmerican journalism more generally.
The fourth part examines the rise of Arab satellite TV channels and their
impact on the "war of ideas". It focuses on the growing influence of Al
Jazeera, and the controversy around the launch of Al Jazeera English, which
U.S. satellite and cable companies have declined to carry. The series
concludes with profiles of several contemporary journalists who have been
murdered because of their work.

The second link is to http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20217 , a review by
Michael Tomasky called 'How Democrats Should Talk' of three books: 'The
Greatest Story Ever Sold: The Decline and Fall of Truth from 9/11 to
Katrina' by Frank Rich; 'Words That Work: It's Not What You Say', It's What
People Hear by Frank Luntz; and 'The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in
Deciding the Fate of the Nation' by Drew Westen. This review is a
fascinating look into three books that discuss language and politics, or
perhaps the language of politics. As well as tactics.

The third link was sent to me by Dan Waber. Thanks, Dan. It's
http://www.boingboing.net/2007/06/21/clay_shirky_defends_.html , an
interesting, thoughtful response by Clay Shirky to 'The Cult of the
Amateur'.

To connect the dots, well, I see these links as putting the issues of 'The
Cult of the Amateur' in a larger context. In other words, these three links
place some issues concerning politics and the Internet in a somewhat larger
context.

Hello Gary, thanks for posting this message.  I've been informed by a member of the company that the plays are now available on a "pay what you wish" basis.  So the $18 is still what they're asking but it's not a fixed fee.  Regards, Tom Savage

“FRANK & STEIN AND FRIENDS” celebrates the short verse play by showcasing
new and old works by both classic and contemporary voices. The centerpiece
of the evening is the world premiere of “The Houses At Falling Hanging,” an
unproduced 1953 play by acclaimed poet Frank O’ Hara about a cheery cocktail
party in a house dangerously close to slipping off the edge of a cliff, that
was considered lost until its discovery at Harvard’s Houghton Library.

Other works in the evening include Gertrude Stein’s “In The Garden,” Edna
St. Vincent Millay’s “Aria De Capo,” and newer works by contemporary poets
such as Simon Pettet, Denise Duhamel, Tom Savage and Gary Sullivan.

I can't seem to view the video that Dave sent thru, but I don't think
Dr Evermore's Forevertron is mentioned.  This is what happens when
you mix large amounts of Wisconsin cheese & Wisconsin beer together.

from "Mi'kmaq; Readings in North America's First Indigenous Script"
by David L. Schmidt & Murdena Marshall, 1995.

"According the Mi'kmap oral tradition, the hieroglyphs were developed
for inscribing maps and tribal records prior to the coming of
Europeans to Mi'kma'ki, the native homeland.  Although physical
evidence for a pre-contact script has not yet been discovered,
seventeenth-century reports by French missionaries testify to the
existence of pictographic writing traditions among Eastern Algonquian-
speaking peoples, a linguistic group which Mi'kmap is a member. The
1651-1652 "Relation" of Father Gabriel Druillettes, for instance,
noted the use of an incipient literacy among the Eastern Abenakis of
Maine:

"Some would write their lessons after a fashion of their own, using a
bit of charcoal for a pen, and a piece of bark instead of paper.
Their characters were new, and so peculiar that one could not
recognize or understand the writing of another--that is to say, they
used certain signs corresponding to their ideas; as it were, a local
reminder, for recalling points and articles and maxims which they had
retained."


The essay goes on to layout a history of how this pictographic
language evolved over the next couple hundred to become "definite
characters" whose understanding was shared among a community of
readers. The symbols which got codified largely related to various
versions of the bible which were translated into the pictographs.
The orthography of Mi'kmaq which I use in the piece I'm working on
comes from a German missionary named Christian Kauder who in the
1860s sent his transcripts to a typographer in Italy who then cut the
type & printed the books.  That font is really only a western
translation of a then 200 year old agit prop form of tribal tagging.
(Apparently most of the copies were lost at sea & only a few copies
of this particular version remain.)





The NYT video of course edited out all of the explanation of what I
was doing.

This is the first two pages of the work.  Originally this was
published in Chris Cheek's assembling magazine, the name of which is
escaping me for the moment.

Heading


Jennifer wanted to disappear. Jennifer disappeared and there was nothing
but rubber. Blow it up she said, make it big. She would cut off her head
and cum shot out what was left of the neck. She held on and Baggy was
dead. Baggy was always dead but she stopped speaking. She couldn't speak
because the air would go out her neck. There was nothing to make things
breathe. She couldn't breathe because the lungs were on the other side of
the neck. She could just about talk but couldn't talk. She made her money
telling secrets.

Jennifer appeared just like a ghost. You could just see her and nothing
else, she wouldn't let you see anything else when she was around. You
wouldn't have the time anyway. You'd just look at Jennifer and maybe she'd
do it to you. And if she did it to you right you'd be dead.

I don't want to mislead you said Jennifer. It's just a story.

Meritage Press is delighted to announce the  release of FRAGILE REPLACEMENTS=
,=20
William Allegrezza's long-awaited poetry  collection. FRAGILE REPLACEMENTS=20
explores the way we live through  language, experiencing births, deaths, and=
=20
rebirths through it, but the book  also examines how our language is filled,=

and the=20
editor-in-chief of Cracked Slab Books  (crackedslabbooks.com).


ADVANCE WORDS on FRAGILE  REPLACEMENTS:
Allegrezza's poetic canvas-of-choice is the lyric,  and his lyrical=20
investigations frequently appear to evolve or grow. . . from an  imagination=
 fueled by=20
found language fragments and theory-singed excesses. This  particular poet's=
=20
capacity to create resonant, "deep" images is  extraordinary.
--Clayton Couch

There is something about  the flow in Allegrezza's poems that I quite like,=20
the way they simply move one  step at a time down the page almost intuitivel=
y.=20
Really, it's the leaps between  lines that impress; almost ghazal-like down=20
the page, jumping from line to line  to line in seeming disconnect.=20

Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education seeks qualified
candidates for 2 full time positions.

Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education (CAPE) improves
student learning through partnering with
schools to integrate the arts in to curriculum. CAPE’s
vision for arts in education positions the arts as
central to the improvement of student learning
and as a key element in vibrant, creative, and
sustainable learning communities.  Beginning with the
organization’s founding in 1992, CAPE has continually
collected data and engaged researchers and evaluators
to study the organization’s programs.

http://capeweb.org

-------------------------------------------------

JOB:  Research Associate

CAPE seeks a Research Associate to help implement
research projects in key CAPE program areas.
The Research Associate will assist in the ongoing
development of CAPE’s overall research plan, and will
implement research strategies for other new CAPE
initiatives as they emerge. The Research Associate
will work directly with CAPE’s university-based
Primary Investigators (head researchers), along with
CAPE administrative staff, in creating and leading
research plans for CAPE programs. The Research
Associate is the lead person in implementing those
plans, and seeing them through to successful
completion. In order to accomplish this, certain areas
of responsibility have been established.

The Research Associate’s primary areas of
responsibility are:

Research tool implementation: The Research Associate
is responsible for administering tools developed for
specific projects and programs. These tools may
include surveys, exit slips, interview protocols, etc.
The Research Associate distributes the research
instruments, and collects, stores and organizes the
data.

Site visits: consulting and documentation: The
Research Associate is responsible for making regular
site visits to schools across the city of Chicago
involved in CAPE research. During site visits, the
Research Associate initiates any needed documentation.
The Research associate also consults on site,
answering teachers’ research questions and making
suggestions as to their documentation strategies and
needs.

Research organization: The Research Associate is
responsible for maintaining a high degree of
organization of all research data, and submitting that
data on time and in a clear manner (the context of the
data clearly indicated) to the appropriate parties.
The Research Associate will maintain appropriate
digital and paper filing systems, easily accessible to
CAPE staff.

Research dialogues: The Research Associate will be
responsible for either conducting or setting up
research interviews with teachers, students, artists,
parents, and/or administrators. These interviews
may be one-on-one, or conducted with groups. The
Research Associate will be responsible for ensuring
interviews and dialogues are recorded, and that this
data is gathered and stored.

Research development: The Research Associate will
contribute to the development of research plans
as needed, and to the development of research tools as
needed.

Reporting and sharing: The Research Associate will
report research findings on a regular basis to
CAPE staff, and periodically to the CAPE Board. The
Research Associate will also communicate
research to participating teachers and artists, and
assist these teachers and artists in their own efforts
to publicly share their knowledge. This public sharing
will include CAPE’s digital research and documentation
system.

Research liaison: The Research Associate serves as the
“on-the-ground” liaison for the Principal
Investigators to all parties relevant to CAPE
programs. S/he will be responsible for regularly
communicating with the PIs to clarify tasks and
responsibilities.

JOB:  Program Associate

CAPE seeks a Program Associate to serve as the
in-the-field representative of CAPE to schools,
teachers, and artists/arts organizations. The Program
Associate performs a critical role in witnessing
CAPE work as it transpires in schools. Connecting
school/teacher/artist specific situations and needs
with overall CAPE goals and vision is a vital and
ongoing task for the Program Associate. The Program
Associate acts as a “communications hub” and “nerve
center” between CAPE and its program efforts.

The Program Associate’s primary areas of
responsibility are:

Communications: The Program Associate is responsible
for updating CAPE teachers and artists; these
updates include alerts as to CAPE professional
developments, CAPE special events, CAPE training or
consulting opportunities, grant offerings, required
submissions of materials, etc. The Program Associate
also reports information regarding events happening in
the schools to CAPE staff, CAPE Board
members, and other partnering schools.

Coordination: professional developments/meetings:
Professional development sessions and/or
cross-site meetings are a regular part of CAPE
practice and all CAPE programs. The Program
Associate is responsible for coordinating, with the
Program Director, the times, dates, and locations of
professional developments. In addition, the Program
Associate works on the agenda for these meetings
with the Program Director, and contacts and sets up
any outside educators that may present at these
meetings.

Organization: The Program Associate is responsible for
gathering and maintaining necessary
administrative work for programs, in consultation with
the CAPE Office Manager and Program Director.
This may include requests for support from teachers
and artists, contracts, payment requests, contracts,
credits for teachers, documentation.

Site visits: witnessing, consulting and documentation:
The Program Associate is responsible for making
regular site visits to CAPE schools across the city of
Chicago. During site visits, the Program
Associate documents work pertaining to CAPE. The
Program Associate also consults on site (with the
support of the Program Director), negotiating any
areas in the teacher/artist partnership which require
CAPE assistance and/or encouragement. The Program
Associate takes on the critical, essential
function of “witnessing”—providing an engaged,
responsive, active audience member, or “witness”, to
the work done by CAPE teachers, artists, and students.

Research: The Program Associate will assist the CAPE
Research Associate and Research Team as
appropriate and necessary in conducting research. This
may include assisting in scheduling interviews,
retrieving data from schools, consulting with teachers
and artists as to documentation, and other tasks as
needed.

Sharing work: The Program Associate will report out on
CAPE schools’ arts integration work to CAPE
staff, and periodically to the CAPE Board. The Program
Associate will assist in CAPE schools’
completing their contributions to CAPE’s digital
documentation system (shared publicly on CAPE’s
website). The Program Associate will present at
conferences and represent CAPE at meetings of arts
organizations as needed and desired. The Program
Associate will coordinate public sharing of the work
produced in CAPE programs (such as the annual CAPE
Convergence, which shares the work of CAPE’s
Veteran schools).

Program development: The Program Associate contributes
greatly to the continuing evolution of the
CAPE programs listed below, helping to shape their
guiding inquiry questions, the nature of their
professional development, their goals, and how they
share their successes. The Program Associate also
may contribute to the development of special
programming efforts.

Qualifications:
&#56256;&#56321; Bachelor’s degree mandatory, Master’s
degree in education, the arts or other related field a
plus
&#56256;&#56321; Experience with public schools and/or

( The text below was created using ytalk, one of the oldest chat forms
online; I logged in twice, speaking to myself in double guise. The video
is about filling out space in another way; the singer is Foofwa
d'Imobilite in a church in the middle of the night, Pringy, Switzerland.
I'm quite happy with both since they imply a kind of Heideggerian writing
into space, home. )

Thanks for forwarding this article David. The perspective is similar to the argument of Dana Gioia, Ted Koozer and those folks who feel that poetry has become too highbrow, but in truth, I think average folks have marginalized themselves with popular culture and it is only a fraction of those U.S. Americans who are not so interested in FOX/CNN/Paris Hilton, etc. who begin to have any interest in poetry nowadays. Before 1950 there was no TV to speak of.

Of course the USA is far and away the most pitched-to nation on earth, so that combined with the boob tube tends to retard the possibilities for a more intelligent use of language.

Listmates:  this message is long overdue.Itis more than a year and a half
since Ron Silliman wrote me a birthday card that said the kindest, most
gracious things about my work.It sent me back to childhood, which for me
took place in middleclass
ngland, where  was firmly, if unwittingly, taught to disavow, if only thru
silence, any praise for my efforts.I loved what
you all wrote to me on Oct.22, 2005, and think it so rude of me, now an
American, not to have responded to every one of your notes. I DID see Ron
last summer when the Silliman family
came to dinner in the garden, and I know I tried to thank HIM
then; please, you other wellwishers, know how grateful  am for
your good wishes and good words.I'd supposed my shyness left me long ago,
but iin Oxtober of 'o5, it struck me sumb. Love,
avid

Paul,

"but in truth, I think average folks have marginalized themselves with

One of my favorite books on this subject is James D. Sullivan's On the Wall=
s
and in the Streets: American Poetry Broadsides from the 1960s. There are
other overviews that have a more historical focus, such as Leslie Shepard's
The History of Street Literature, but I can't think of anything more
contemporary that doesn't deal with the work of a specific press.

Cheers,

Alexander,

Propolis Press prints letterpress broadsides -- but as a rule, these
broadsides are related to a book.  (I did one a few years ago of a
Michael Palmer poem 'Crossing the Hill' with a translation into
Egyptian hieroglyphs, which was not related to a book project.)
For the amount of effort they require (that anything letterpress
requires), it is really an act of love. (& I tend to be discriminating
with regard to what I love.)

As broadsides are really the domain of letterpress printing
-  you might contact the book arts listserv with your query:
BOOK_ARTS-L@LISTSERV.SYR.EDU


best wishes,

Murat,

Thanks for your question. I think that it is largely seen that poetry is marginalized in our culture. The notion is that poets have become so esoteric that they are no longer useful to the average person. In an interview, I asked Victor Hernandez Cruz this and he felt the opposite was the case, that average folks (and I paraphrase because I dont have his actual response handy) that average folks have so dumbed themselves down, poetry is not relevant because they are interested in Larry King interviewing Paris Hilton and other banalities that will be forgotten in a year or two, perhaps less.

TV (& the mainstream media in general) is not interested in helping people become more conscious. If people are more conscious, then advertising does not work as well, making the ultimate job of TV and media, selling products, more difficult.  If we really NEEDED milk, they would not need to advertise it. This is why TV panders to ignorant and fearful people and must keep dumbing things down, because intelligent people tend to turn it off. (The alternate view would be to create an oasis of intelligence, but aside from PBS and the occasional cable offering, TV is waaaay stupid.)

Interestingly, KUOW-FM, one of two full-time, full-power NPR signals, would be rated #1 in the Seattle-Tacoma market if non-commercial stations were allowed to be counted in the Arbitron ratings service. Seattle also tends to be one of the more literate towns in the U.S. Either NPR is great, or the lack of commercials attracts people sick of pitches, except of course for those twice-a-year fund drives which makes anyone crazy. Perhaps it is a little of both. There is not much more going on in radio, though I find KUOW and NPR in general maddeningly mechanistic.

My feeling is that poets are called to make as deep a gesture as possible and let the cultural machinations play themselves out. We must become more conscious as a species, as the planet will only put up with so much. Poets and other artists should lead the way, not pander to people who care about Paris Hilton and, who was that former Playboy bunny who died a few months ago?

I don't know that "marginalized" is the correct word in this situation.  I
don't see how people composing the vast majority can be "marginalized." I'd
say that the masses have assimilated a myopic view of what constitutes
culture and that this view has reduced the notion of culture to the top best
sellers in books, music and movies, and to the celebrity subculture of Paris
Hilton et al. The majority of people haven't so much "marginalized"
themselves as limited themselves to the "marginal perception" of culture
that we now call the mainstream. Unfortunately, their practice of putting
horse blinders on their cognitive horizons has left most artists who work
outside of "the best-seller is best" culture marginalized to such an extent
that it's almost impossible to find means of publication that will reach an
audience larger than a small living room could contain.

On be half of Hilton Paris, I don't how  many of you saw the blurred image
of her ( CNN/Fox, etc.) where she was looking through the back side window
of the police car. Her hair was totally disheveled, her mouth open,
apparently screaming (for her mother?) at the top of her lungs. It was right
up there with Munch's 'Scream' and in violent contrast with her 'ordinary'
vanilla demeanor.

Point is, that if you keep scratching surface of pop culture ultimately an
epiphany pops through. I suspect something in Paris Hilton - no matter all
the $hine, as well as the 'self-prescribed & whatever other medications  -
is constantly screaming.  (Whether or not true,  WCW's dictum about folks
dying daily from the lack of poetry might, it seems, apply to Paris'
emotional poverty).

I suspect Paris' condition hold for George Bush - I mean how can he possibly
live with himself knowing the hopeless carnage he has 'created' in Iraq, as
well as an American political disaster,  etc. If not pills, I suspect liquor
must be back to him again, to keep those screams from coming up.

Of course, there is the iron horse killer, Cheney. The day he gives into the
consequences of his actions does not appear to be on the immediate horizon.
There  are some criminals that never blink, or break - and righteousness is
often the manta. I am afraid he is one. (The current series of articles on
the Veep in the W Post are beyond creepy).

Where anyone's poetry book or magazine penetrates the larger media shield
with any impact is obviously a crap shoot. However, I think that begs a more
serious question. What are the ways poets can begin to engage the public
world in ways that challenge the status quo of media (etc.) control? I don't
mean just getting the 'ear and eye' of the public, but what are the
questions poets need to both ask and explore in order to redefine and become
a genuine part of the public conversation. I think this dia- or multi-log
has been missing.

Certainly it seems, I think to many of us- if the aim of poets is limited to
getting a body of work  discussed on an MLA Panel, and/or included in an
academic text anthology (valuable as all that might be) - the world of
poetry will remain marginalized from any significant intrusion or play in
the body politic and the 'body cultural'.

Murat,

I would not suggest 70 % of the population in America is stupid. I think you and I basically agree that something elitist is limited. Stephen Vincent asks:

"Where anyone's poetry book or magazine penetrates the larger media shield
with any impact is obviously a crap shoot. However, I think that begs a more
serious question. What are the ways poets can begin to engage the public
world in ways that challenge the status quo of media (etc.) control?"

In my own work I think there are levels of accessibility. One form I got from Ginsberg and have used extensively is that of the American Sentence, a 17 syllable poem similar to haiku but without the conventions we associate with haiku.  Some sentences are from dreams, or are odd in other ways. Some are quite obvious, some more subtle.  www.AmericanSentences.com for examples.

What this form allows me to do is relate to a crowd, or segments of a crowd, which is not as literary-oriented. Of course I try to read the audience and stretch them a bit beyond their comfort zone, but that's just me. Even many "literary" crowds seem to prefer rhetoric over poetry, but there will be those who get the readl thing and who seek the duende.

Paul,

I do not want to put myself in the position of defending "Larry King/Paris Hilton interviews." I do agree with you the constant focus on murders or silly scandals, which tends to crowd any factual news out (at best consigned to ticker tapes at the bottom of the screen, at worst replaced by faux, manufactured news, like the still extant terrorist watch color schemes) functions as the equivalent of circuses in Roman times or "offering them cakes instead of bread."


On the other hand, I do not think modern (or "innovative" in contemporary terms) poetry should be blind to the consequences of its own historical choices. In my view, modern poetry starts -for many good reasons- with a critique of the "bourgeois" culture. This by definition creates a dichotomy (stated more positively, a confrontation) between "us" ("artists") and "them" ("stupid" folks). Basically, the avant garde poetry, as far as I can see, rarely relinquished this position, except in discontinuous moments like 19th century American photography (particularly in Daguerreotypes, Civil War photos and Brady's studio portraits), Russian Constructionist art and poetry, Bauhus architecture, etc. The "innovative" American poetry of the last twenty-thirty years return a strikingly fundementalist, rejuvenated return to this dichotomy, confrontation plus so to speak, since its own self-definition is totally based on such controversy.


It seems to me, if one calls more than 70% of a population stupid, whatever, one should expect, not be surprised that those people will stop listening. I think calling pop culture ignorant, etc,, somehow inferior to "innovative" art, makes zero sense to me. Some of the most brilliant things happen in popular culture, in pop music (the list here is endless and everyone has his or her favorites, resonant works), in movies, in
T.V. These works connect with the psyche of the general populace (those over 200 million stupid people in The United States alone), reflecting, embodying their dreams, their fears, etc., in a way that any serious artist, in my view, should be ready to give his or her eye-teeth to emulate, and that artists, poets can ignore at their own peril.


I think popular art has a lot to teach "innovative" poets, starting with the radical visual , verbal and sound experiments they carry out to  connect with their audience. If nothing else, they constitute a treasure house  of innovations, on fluidity, grid, tonal nuances, radical cuts, etc. Is there a poem that points as profoundly the grim conditions in factories as "Sympathy for Mr. Vangeance" or conditions in a woman's prison as "Lady Vengeance?" Is there a poem which uses "pathetic fallacy" in a completely new way -as a way of re-defining an environment, of creating a new language made of daily objects like mops, sardine cans, etc.- as Chunking Express. Is there anything as epic as The Sopranos credits? I know, one may consider The Sopranos as one of the "bourgeois melodramas" which fool people.  But, as a dumb New Jerseyite, I love it. The credits is a collage of found objects, collected out of the scraps -or objects soon to be scrapped- of industrial landscape, fused
 into a dolorous song -my song.


Paul, I am trying to say that we as poets should widen our horizons. Maybe to realize that Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau (and of course Melville) create as significant a nexus of modernism, at least of the 21st century kind, as Rimbaud, etal. (One should not forgot, Baudelaire was the great admirer of Poe, of his very language of the street, "the crowds."


Ciao,

Murat

Murat,

Thanks for your question. I think that it is largely seen that poetry is marginalized in our culture. The notion is that poets have become so esoteric that they are no longer useful to the average person. In an interview, I asked Victor Hernandez Cruz this and he felt the opposite was the case, that average folks (and I paraphrase because I dont have his actual response handy) that average folks have so dumbed themselves down, poetry is not relevant because they are interested in Larry King interviewing Paris Hilton and other banalities that will be forgotten in a year or two, perhaps less.


TV (& the mainstream media in general) is not interested in helping people become more conscious. If people are more conscious, then advertising does not work as well, making the ultimate job of TV and
 media, selling products, more difficult.  If we really NEEDED milk, they would not need to advertise it. This is why TV panders to ignorant and fearful people and must keep dumbing things down, because intelligent people tend to turn it off. (The alternate view would be to create an oasis of intelligence, but aside from PBS and the occasional cable offering, TV is waaaay stupid.)


Interestingly, KUOW-FM, one of two full-time, full-power NPR signals, would be rated #1 in the Seattle-Tacoma market if non-commercial stations were allowed to be counted in the Arbitron ratings service. Seattle also tends to be one of the more literate towns in the
U.S. Either NPR is great, or the lack of commercials attracts people sick of pitches, except of course for those twice-a-year fund drives which makes anyone crazy. Perhaps it is a little of both. There is not much more going on in radio, though I find KUOW and NPR in general maddeningly mechanistic.


My feeling is
 that poets are called to make as deep a gesture as possible and let the cultural machinations play themselves out. We must become more conscious as a species, as the planet will only put up with so much. Poets and other artists should lead the way, not pander to people who care about Paris Hilton and, who was that former Playboy bunny who died a few months ago?

I'm close to Paul and Vernon on this, with this addition: I feel many =
people
would be interested by and even like much of the thought and sound and
beauty of what we like if given access to it and allowed (by =
themselves?) to
listen. I remember reading Stein at a party to a few people on the side =
who
listened closely, and ask me to repeat phrases, and then would hum &c. =
I'm
sure every one has had such an experience. Once in a sophomore lit. =
class a
young woman asked me what a poem meant. I looked at it and thought of a
dozen ways to begin, but instead followed a strange path for me, but one =
I
felt utterly correct: I read the poem over. The entire class seemed to
understand and if I remembered the young woman nodded.

What saddens me is the fact that so many do not find the portals. But =
there
are always some even in popular culture(Bob Dylan was mine in 1964). And =
I
believe that there are more and more everyday. At least it seems to me =
that
more young people want to talk about the work of those most of us would =
find
interesting.

The margins are expanding.

I don't know that "marginalized" is the correct word in this situation.  =
I
don't see how people composing the vast majority can be "marginalized." =
I'd
say that the masses have assimilated a myopic view of what constitutes
culture and that this view has reduced the notion of culture to the top =

sellers in books, music and movies, and to the celebrity subculture of =
Paris
Hilton et al. The majority of people haven't so much "marginalized"

Work
by Dan Boehl
Winner of the Pavement Saw Press Chapbook Award
Paper Trade: ISBN 978-1-886350-69-4
28 pages, $6
  These poems first appeared in: LIT, Poetry East and Redivider.
Here is a scintillating sample:

Cube, or
7 Complete Strangers of Widely Varying Personality Characteristics are Involuntarily Placed in an Endless Kafkaesque Maze Containing Deadly Traps
  Able to take only so much hip-hop and databases,
I get some coffee and shoot-the-shit
with the co-workers there. Times like this
I think about that movie Cube.
The best-worst movie I have ever seen,
it’s about these people who wake up in a giant cube.
Frantically they run around the cube’s identical rooms
discovering each other
and getting bloodbathed by unforeseen traps
set by an unseen boss. It’s a test. If they work together
they live. They fall into the regular
character types: the soldier, the clown, the babe.
Only the autistic guy lives.
He actually likes the work of not getting
bloodbathed. Tomorrow, I’ll be
somebody's boss. But today
I can confidently count on myself
as someone I would like.

Vernon, Paul, Stephen,

I think it is important for American poets to realize that words (and
therefore poets) in this culture have a subservient place and find
strategies of transforming this "weakness" into strength. In the pursuit of
such transformation many things will fall into place. In our culture
information, either intelligent or stupid or profound or banal, is
communicated through visual, words basically acting as "accents." Accent
means a variety of things: one the one hand, we have accent as interior
designers use it, as a "supporting" color. For instance, Bush in pilot
uniform, "mission accomplished" as a back drop. On the other hand, one has
accent as a distortion, something not quite heard correctly, something
subversive despite itself. One can go here again to  Bush, to his "bring it
on," a drug addled madness which must have stunned every one who heard it
(something similar to Paris Hilton's, "seen" rather than heard scream in the
car). Accent in this sense is something very unstable, beyond control.

"MISSION ACCOMPLISHED" and "bring it on" are purely linguistically very
simple phrases. What gives them their awesome power (and their potential
ability to turn against their users) is the space within which they occur. I
think American poets should gain (or regain) the ability to place language
in space, to see language in a potent (unstable, white) emptiness
surrounding it. Of course, such a step will require not seeing language
being completely sui generis -instead of thinking of the sea of language in
which we move (and surely we do that), but the space (the elsewhere, the
Martian or global) from which language arrives.

Ciao,

Murat

I think John Latta has a wonderful current double entry 'critical'
celebration and 'then some' streak on Berrigan's transfigurations of some of
Ungaretti's poems. Nice to get a re-hit of 60's New York-Kansas very male
wind - add a little play pretend self-mocking hard ass humor - coming down
the blog pipe - I say/

Guns In Loving Memory
150 works on paper by Dan Waber

These works grew out of a convergence of several ongoing areas of
investigation, but the primary motivation was an attempt to come to
grips (both literally and metaphorically) with the way American
culture uses language to glorify war.

The pieces are essentially anti-war visual poems made by taking
rubbings from public monuments.

Each was made in situ, using lumber crayons on paper (a set of tools
whose rich potential I learned through the work of, and in
correspondence with, David-Baptiste Chirot), and each individual piece
limits itself to the language found on a single monument (though some
monuments yielded multiple pieces).

My hope is that the pieces operate on such a basic level that anyone
who views them will, from that day forward, regardless of ideological
agreement or disagreement, find themselves automatically locating the
anti- language contained within the language of monuments.

Show opens Friday July 6th from 6pm to 10pm at:

Test Pattern
334 Adams Ave
Scranton, PA 18509
USA

In 1999 a stone was uncovered in Vera Cruz, Mexico called the Cascajal ston=

  The stone is=20

As a side note, I am attempting to apply for a grant to travel to Vera Cruz=
 to study and "translate" the stone, which is of course, impossible.  Anthr=
opologists working=20

advice?

I am in the Monterey-Carmel-Pebble-Beach area this week; if there are
UBPos in or around town, please drop me a line. I'll be in New York City
for the two weeks after that; if there are UBPos who want to hang out in
the city, again please get in touch.

Finally, I have some new (poetic) material, and if anyone is looking to
fill a reading slot in New York on those dates, get in touch.

All the best,

Olive Juice Music is a D.I.Y. label, studio, and mail-order distributor
based in New York City and interested in helping people who are in the
developmental stages of trying to do something with their art. Olive Juice
Music is not a traditional record label. The artists associated with Olive
Juice take an active part in how their music is produced, financed, and
marketed. They in turn receive more of the profits gained from the sales of
their records directly, which is how it should be. The strength of Olive
Juice relies upon the active participation of its members to share resource=
s
and help promote a communal spirit among everyone involved as well as
claiming responsibility for taking their art to wherever they would like it
to go.

Dear List,
Russell Salamon, a poet living in the Hollywood Hills of CA, has just
published a facsimile edition of the late d.a.levy's most significant
collection from 1967, _ukanhavurfukinciti bak_, which, in addition to an
anthology of his visual works and major poems, contains a full
documentary history of the way levy was targeted, harassed, arrested &
outlawed as a poet (forbidden to read, his mimeograph confiscated &
never returned, and many friends were jailed or moved west).  Along with
tribute texts from a wide range of known and lesser-known figures above
and below the radar during the mimeo revolution of the mid-1960s, the
book is a much an important historical source-text as it is the
"collected works" of an incredibly (almost impossibly) prolific and
inventive career that lasted only five years. levy embodied fully the
true counter-culture of the time, which is definitely not the one the
New York Times or the MLA wants you to see.

I have 5 copies of this @400-page 8.5" X 11" "mimeo-style" book
available. If anyone is interested in buying one ($20), please back
channel or call me (903-5725). Russell and I are also trying to find out
where Bill Bissett lives or is, or if anyone has contact info., or if
someone can take his copies to him (he has a poem in the book).  If any
Canadian poets/poetics grads. or frequent Toronto-goers could help out,
we'd all (Russell, Bill & I) be very grateful.  Also if this could be
forwarded to UB poetry lists, that would probably help.

thanks,
Doug Manson\

Folks,

If, like me, you get your music via Internet radio stations like the great
WFMU (www.wfmu.org) or any of the thousands of other Internet radio
stations, then you should be very concerned about the new webcasting rates
set by the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board and due to go into effect in just
over two weeks.

Perhaps the issue already has been aired on this list: I only learned of it
yesterday, thanks to the national Day of Silence action.

Due to retroactive application of the royalty rate hike (a 300-1200%
increase, retroactive to January 1, 2006) an estimated 90 percent of online
radio stations will be bankrupted on July 15 -- when the rates go into
effect.

Please write your Representatives and Senators!

This is not an anti-royalty movement: it is about diversity in the media
environment, and public control of the digital domain.  More information,
and links, below.

National Day of Silence for Webcasters

Across the U.S. today, thousands of internet radio stations are observing a
national Day of Silence to protest new webcasting rates set by the U.S.
Copyright Royalty Board. These new rates, which will go into effect on July
15 (and are retroactive to January 1, 2006), will drastically increase the
royalties webcasters must pay to SoundExchange, an offshoot of the RIAA
responsible for distributing this money to artists.

WFMU believes in compensating artists. We currently pay webcasting royalties
to SoundExchange and will continue to do so, but we are protesting the new
rate scheme for a number of reasons:

1. Under the new rates, non-commercial webcasters only get a break on the
commercial royalty rate if they maintain small listenership numbers. In
order to afford the astronomical new rates, WFMU may have to cap online
listenership on our streams, limiting the exposure we give to independent
artists by blocking our accessibility to music fans.

2. SoundExchange has not been dutifully distributing webcasting royalties to
musicians, claiming on their website that they are unable to locate
thousands of artists including Kraftwerk, The Replacements, Pizzicato Five,
The Muffs, and even Warren G!

Instead of webcasting silence today, WFMU has decided to boycott all music
that is registered with the RIAA and/or SoundExchange. Today, you will hear
songs from live performances on WFMU, material from the public domain,
orphaned works, music from bands and record labels that have signed a waiver
releasing WFMU from SoundExchange's unreasonable royalty scheme, and music
from artists that SoundExchange has neglected to pay.

We hope that this sends the message that WFMU is fully capable of airing
great music that falls outside of the RIAA and SoundExchange's control.

If you would like to protest the new webcasting royalty rates, please call
or write to your Representatives and Senators before July 15, and tell them
to support the Internet Radio Equality Act (S. 1353 and HR. 2060). Visit
SaveNetRadio.org for more information, including a quick way to look up
contact info for your elected officials.

POETRY FEEDS THE WORLD

Meritage Press (MP) is pleased to inaugurate a new series of Tiny
Books that aligns poetry with fair trade and economic development
issues affecting Third World countries.

MP's Tiny Books initially will utilize small books ( 1 3/4 x 1 3/4")
made in Guatemala by artisans paid fair wages, as sourced by
Baksheesh, a fair trade retailer.  All profits from book sales then
will be donated to Heifer International, an organization devoted to
reducing world hunger by promoting sustainable sources of food and
income.

We are delighted to announce that MP's first Tiny Book is

all alone again
by Dan Waber

Dan Waber is a visual poet, concrete poet, sound poet, performance
poet, publisher, editor, playwright and multimedia artist whose work
has appeared in all sorts of delicious places, from digital to print,
from stage to classroom, from mailboxes to puppet theaters. He is
currently working on "and everywhere in between". He makes his online
home at logolalia.com.

Meritage Press tapped Mr. Waber to inaugurate the series partly for
his work in minimalist poetry.  Tiny Book #2 will feature Tom
Beckett's first hay(na)ku poetry collection, Steps: A Notebook.  The
hay(na)ku also is a form that lends itself to minimalism.

With Tiny Books, MP also offers a new DIY, or Do-It-Yourself Model of
publishing.  You've heard of POD or print-on-demand?  Well, these
books' print runs will be based on HOD or Handwritten-on-Demand.  MP's
publisher, Eileen Tabios, will handwrite all texts into the Tiny
Books' pages and books will be released to meet demand for as long as
MP is able to source tiny books -- or until the publisher gets
arthritis.

This project reflects Meritage Press' belief that "Poetry feeds the
world" in non-metaphorical ways.

Each Tiny Book will cost $10 plus $1.00 shipping/handling. To purchase
Dan Waber's all alone again and donate to Heifer International, send a
check for $11.00 made out to "Meritage Press" to

Subject: Re: Indigenous Writing Systems--Miekal And and the NYT


In 1999 a stone was uncovered in Vera Cruz, Mexico called the Cascajal
stone.  It is a remnant of the ancient Olmec culture which predates the
Mayans.  The stone is
said to contain some kind of writing system.  Some anthropologists have even
hazarded a guess that the stone may contain a poem.  Since there are very
few
corroborating artifacts, it is difficult to even say with certainty that the
stone contains a writing sample-however, it appears as though that is the
case.  The stone-
as it has no library or translation guide of any kind-is completely obscure
and cannot be translated.  I believe this stone is the earliest example of a
writing system
anywhere on the Americas.  See "Oldest Writing in the World" by Carmen
Rodriguez in Vol. 313 p. 1610, the September 2006 issue of Science weekly.

As a side note, I am attempting to apply for a grant to travel to Vera Cruz
to study and "translate" the stone, which is of course, impossible.
Anthropologists working
with the culture and in the region have been resistant.  It is difficult to
garner information about the stone, or about a poet's possibility of working
with it.  Any
advice?

Meritage Press Announcement

For more information: MeritagePress@aol.com

POETRY FEEDS THE WORLD

Meritage Press (MP) is pleased to inaugurate a new series of Tiny Books that aligns poetry with fair trade and economic development issues affecting Third World countries.

MP's Tiny Books initially will utilize small books ( 1 3/4 x 1 3/4") made in Guatemala by artisans paid fair wages, as sourced by Baksheesh, a fair trade retailer.? All profits from book sales then will be donated to Heifer? International, an organization devoted to reducing world hunger by promoting sustainable sources of food and income..

We are delighted to announce that MP's first Tiny Book is

all alone again
by Dan Waber

Dan Waber is a visual poet, concrete poet, sound poet, performance poet, publisher, editor, playwright and multimedia artist whose work has appeared in all sorts of delicious places, from digital to print, from stage to classroom, from mailboxes to puppet theaters. He is currently working on "and everywhere in between". He makes his online home at logolalia.com.

Meritage Press tapped Mr. Waber to inaugurate the series partly for his work in minimalist poetry.? Tiny Book #2 will feature Tom Beckett's first hay(na)ku poetry collection, Steps: A Notebook.? The hay(na)ku also is a form that lends itself to minimalism.

With Tiny Books, MP also offers a new DIY, or Do-It-Yourself Model of publishing.? You've heard of POD or print-on-demand?? Well, these books' print runs will be based on HOD or Handwritten-on-Demand.? MP's publisher, Eileen Tabios, will handwrite all texts into the Tiny Books' pages and books will be released to meet demand for as long as MP is able to source tiny books -- or until the publisher gets arthritis.

This project reflects Meritage Press' belief that "Poetry feeds the world" in non-metaphorical ways.? The Tiny Books create demand for fair trade workers' products while also sourcing donations for easing poverty in poorer areas of the world.

Each Tiny Book will cost $10 plus $1.00 shipping/handling. To purchase Dan Waber's all alone again and donate to Heifer International, send a check for $11.00 made out to "Meritage Press" to

(I joined this list to keep up with Ann Bogle, but:)

My heart starts beating a little faster when hearing dialogue about Poetry
and The Masses -- something could go very wrong very quickly. It's magnetic.
In terms of Murat and others, I recall "Many people would rather die than
think," attributed to Bertrand Russell. (To which he added, "And most do.")
The ability of poets to see language -- to see it before using it -- and to
see it in a "potent (unstable, white) emptiness" seems a fine way to
articulate the (better) mission to be accomplished. Of course it gives me
headaches on the best of days -- and I was able to find my way here -- so I
can't fault anyone else who successfully avoids it.

What I have been wondering is why my country, the US, has so successfully
created a society of such great wealth and such puny thought. (Democracy is
a failed experiment.)  (Sell-evision is dastardly but can't take all blame.)
I suspect commodity fetishism in all these matters--a literal opposite of
the potent emptiness....

(Orwell's Politics and the English Language comes to mind, too.)

In 1964 I saw the Olmec heads there,
but didnt hear of any ancient writing.
The heads themselves are still one of the great
mysteries of America.

(This strongly relates to the construct of avatars in Second Life; think of the
gnats as prims. Their homeostatic behavior is amazing.
Hieroglyphs of an ancient species...)


Gnat swarming behavior

The following video was made about 100 meters from the Jordan River trail
in Salt Lake City (West Jordan / Midvale), Utah. The site is a pond per-
haps one or two acres across; there are numerous birds (swallows, swifts,
red-wing and yellow-head blackbirds, etc.) around. When I first saw the
gnats, near sundown, they swarmed in a typical ellipsoidal fashion, i.e.
similar to a free-falling water balloon in slow motion. I noticed several
columns forming; in a short while, they became vertical, long and narrow.
They swayed and held shape. In gnat swarms, males and females behave
differently; in one of the vertical columns, a roughly spherical 'head' is
visible to one side, and I wonder if there might be sexual differentiation
here. What is fascinating to me is the relationship of millions of gnats
to an over-arching geometry; this parallels slime mold behavior to some
extent. I've seen lots of gnat swarms before, but nothing like this. We're
leaving the Salt Lake City area today, so I have no time to investigate
this further at the moment (we're leaving today), but I'm interested in
any further input, images, videos, you might have.

The only sound that Cherokee has which the Japanese do not have is the
one located to the far left of Sequoyah's syllabary--the soft "un" or
glottal stop.  The rest is close enough--with some "spot on" identical
sounds to make it possible to write in Japanese using it.  Ko-Ga
(Crow/Ch.). for instance is easy.  (Ka Ra Su--Crow/Jp.) Tsa-La-Gi is an
easy one.  Try it and see.  The opposite also works--use the Katakana
syllabery and you'll see the similarities and the very few differences.

I'm happy to say that one of my seminar students several years back did
the first Japanese-Cherokee/ Cherokee-Japanese "dictionary".  It's
actually just a word list of about 60 pages.  We also translated Elias
Boudinott's Poor Sarah into Japanese.  This is supposedly the first
Native American "novel."  There's lots of interest here in "The
Trail of Tears" and of course in the language.  I gave a series of
Sunday lectures on this topic back in the 1990's when I lived in
Fukuoka. Catch me back-channel if you want to know more.  Jess

I also value that essay.

A most curious reading of that essay (by Frank Lutz) is mentioned in
http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20217 , Michael Tomasky's review called 'How
Democrats Should Talk'. Tomasky reviews three books, including Frank Lutz's
'Words that Work'. Apparently Lutz is a great fan of this Orwell essay. But
he is also described as "the Republicans' most famous spin doctor of the
past fifteen years".

Yeesh.

Folks,

I'm sorry to say that I've joined the blogosphere.  I'm working on poetry's affinities with cultural work, particularly around war resistance and peacemaking.  If you have a poem or item of interest that could be included, email me.  Thanks.

In case it has not already hit your radar, the Cheney Supreme Court
Just(!) ruled that race cannot be taken into consideration in student
assignments to schools - apparently reversing the "Brown versus Board of
Education" decision 53 years ago. School integration, affirmative action,
etc. "bye-bye".  "Separate but never equal" appears to be the obvious
message of this new court majority.

I don't know about everyone else, but given the magnitude of the Civil
Rights struggles of the last 60 years, this decision is mind numbing and
astonishing. In fifty years, or much less I suspect a great playwright will
reproduce this event as an Apartheid black comedy or tragedy - depending on
how things now begin to unfold.  I suspect diverse Asian, African-American
and Latino communities - even conservatives among them - are not going to
let this decision go down so easily.

Like the regime that put Roberts and Alito into power on this court, this
strikes me as criminal - and it's going to take a lot of push back to clear
the damage done.

BLACK STONE by Dale Smith
80pp., perfect bound
ISBN 0-9794745-0-7=20

Some praise for BLACK STONE:


BLACK STONE is a work of such beauty, it makes me tremble. Dale Smith, a po=
et and citizen of earth, creates a whole cloth composed of the personal and=
 the political. Set in Austin, Texas, during Bush's endless siege on human =
rights and democracy, this master work documents the birth and first few we=
eks of his newborn babe's life against the backdrop of anxiety and war.    =
 --Brenda Coultas



This is a book written from a man living on the other side of Texas -- the =
state of heightened awareness, exposed roots, and unearthed secret stones. =
It is a chilling narrative that confronts the terrifying mysteries of child=
birth and the shroud of daily life that holds and sustains this most intima=
te act. Like the constantly shifting belly of his wife, this is a book that=
 moves between essay and poetry, consciousness and dream, and the deeper th=
reads that connect daily life to the marvelous. But there is also the prese=
nce of horror -- the political situation of these dark ages, with all its w=
ars, alarms, and demands for action. I'm hesitating to write about the emot=
ional intensity and sensitivity of this book -- is it amazing that this boo=
k was written by a man, a father who, through this writing, attempts to exp=
erience and protect the inner life of his wife by bringing forth his own da=
rk child? This is a book of daring consciousness battling with the dark age=
s -- it struggles against its own clarity because language is a rooted thin=
g, and our minds must be dirty to be in it, to tend those twisty, crusted b=
ranches. And yet, this struggle documents Smith's stand -- a brave and inti=
mate book by one of our finest poets.  --Kristin Prevallet



Refusing to make it lovely, Dale Smith logs a descriptive notation of prese=
nce to the world as stomp, shift, and quick adjustment to the ?rush of ever=
y day things.?  (When the child suggests, Let?s follow that buzzard, so you=
 do, ?sort of.?)  On every page, the world opens to the body and the body t=
o the world. Smith simultaneously narrates his wife?s pregnancy and the thi=
ckness of event (as ideality, language, culture, personal memory, familial =
intimacy); the birth of their second son and the emergence of that shared c=
ontext of inseparable meanings and relationships by which we orient ourselv=
es toward place and others.  He never looks away.  Reading him, neither do =
I.    --Forrest Gander

"Then in a wailful choir the smal gnats morn
Among the river sallows, borne aloft
Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies. . . ."
[John Keats, To Autumn]

Thank you, Alan. The video is just beautiful.

The altered books project at:

http://www.logolalia.com/alteredbooks/

has been updated with new work by:

Nico Vassilakis, John M. Bennett, Mike Magazinnik, Sheila E. Murphy,
Holly Crawford, Meghan Scott, and Michelle Taransky.

Enjoy,
Dan

PS: Over the course of the two and a half years since the project
started nearly 600 pages have been completed and posted to the
site. Also in that time a few participants have dropped out, or never
really fully begun. Thus, I have a few potentially open spots in the
project if anyone were interested in joining. If you'd like to
participate, please back-channel me at dwaber@logolalia.com with your
interest, and I will begin the process of getting materials back from
those who've stopped and re-locating them where there's active
interest.

Intensive Learning Term poet-in-residence program,
April 29-May 16, 2008

From the early 1930s to the mid 1940s, Olivet College
hosted some of the best-known writers of the time:
Sinclair Lewis, Sherwood Anderson, Katherine Ann
Porter, Carl Sandburg, Ford Madox Ford, W.H. Auden,
and Gertrude Stein. In that tradition, Olivet has
established an annual residency program for poets who
are establishing a name for themselves in this new
millennium.

During the 2008 Intensive Learning Term, the Olivet
College Humanities Department will offer its second
poet-in-residence position. The Sandburg-Auden-Stein
poet will live on campus from April 29 - May
16, 2008, and teach ENG 247: Poetry Writing.

The Sandburg-Auden-Stein poet will also host two
public events: a public reading of his or her work and
a stand-alone talk/discussion on a subject of his or
her choice (publishing poetry, beat poets, def
poetry, etc.).

An award of $3,100 (plus room and board) will be given
to the 2008 resident poet. The Humanities Department
faculty will evaluate the submissions
and choose the winner. Poets who have published at
least one book of poetry are eligible.

Submit four copies of the following postmarked by
Sept. 10, 2007:
five poems from your most recent book, a single page
personal statement regarding your poetics and
teaching, a current resume and two references. There
is no entry fee.

Please contact Kirk Hendershott-Kraetzer, Ph.D.,
Humanities Department chair, with your questions at
(269) 749-7621 or
khendershott-kraetzer@olivetcollege.edu.

Application materials should be sent by regular mail
to:

The CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION opines that this will not have any immediate
effect upon the current confused state of the law governing university
education -- [which is little comfort considering the effect of today's
decision upon the prospects of many students ever getting to college] -- but
even if that's true, it's only true until someone gets a university case in
front of this malignant court --

Breyer's dissents today were unusually heated (though still the paragon of
civility compared to anything Scalia turns out, even when he agrees with the
majority).

Oddly enough, the current issue of National Geographic has an article on
swarming theory and behavior. The quote is wonderful; what I found amazing
was that the gnats held themselves almost against the (light) wind; the
columns sways slightly, but never 'broke.' I heard there were gnat swarms
on the Discovery Channel Planet Earth (I think that's the name) series,
that also evinced beautiful patterns, but I haven't seen them.

this is an interesting ongoing saga--with finally the appearance of the "ma=
nifesto" and apprehension of a "suspect"--small rebellions against street a=
rt by "names" and commercialy succesful artists have gone on for some time =
(abt 25 years that i can think/know of)--but not previously getting this ki=
nd of attention--i think the reason, one of them, given for the attacks is =
a reasonable one so to speak--that the street art by names and street art o=
f a "safe" kind does indeed signal a kind of gentrification going on, both =
physiclaly and in a mental/spiritual/artist plane of a "domesticating" and =
"exploiting" of the public environment, in a sense having it turned over no=
t to a more liberated public sphere--but to a more confined privatized sphe=
re, in which the "name" artist simply converts what is already there into s=
omething of greater "value"--a work which gives simultanesouly the logo/sig=
n of "street art" as "transgression" and "detournement" etc--while also bei=
ng perfectly safe, confined within the sphere of the logo/name--and hence, =
indeed, an excellent invitation to gentrification--            there's a ve=
ry interesting and as they say "contested" area between the private vision =
of an artist and privatization--as well as what really is a public area, sp=
here in the first place--what parts of it are "owned" and by whom--or are r=
ented and by and to whom--or are guarded by security and by whom and from w=
hom--            it rather hilariously and sadly ties in with about a week =
a go two squad cars being called on me while i was making rubBEings at a co=
nstruction site--more of the ever ongoing "raw war" series & a jack spicer =
series--i had a vision dream re the future of the rubBEings--and wrote it t=
o a number of people--then just a couple days ago read of an upcoming galle=
ry show of monument rubbings--though the article notes the example of the r=
ubBEings and myself, it is as though the monuments and gallery are a kind o=
f "gentrification"  and "graveyard"  made by anti-rubBEings--for the monume=
nt whatever use one makes of it, is created to draw focus to a center, a "c=
enter of attention"--whereas with rubBEings, which work with things fragmen=
ted, dispersed, hidden in plain site/sight/cite--the attention to a center =
which "commands" in a military and dictatorial sense "attention"--is let lo=
ose anarkeyologically among peripheries--so in a way--as in the vision drea=
m--rubbings of monuments become a "rubbing out" of rubBEings--(in the visio=
n dreams there were raw graves & raw bits of me & rubBEings with stones by =
them and kicked into them -which--on reading--one realizes--have turned int=
o  monuments of/with rubbings--though what it means is not perhaps "death" =
so much as being "underground" or the journey into and then return fro the =
"underworld"--both "hidden in plain site/sight/cite" and "One cannot hide f=
rom that which never sets" Heraclitus)From: davidbchirot@hotmail.comTo: dav=

As Street Art Goes Commercial, a Resistance Raises a Real Stink






By COLIN MOYNIHAN



The covert campaign targeting street art began about seven months ago, with=
 blobs of paint that appeared overnight, obscuring murals and wheat-pasted =
art on walls in Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan.

And they dance in certain places. Over ditches of warm water. Could it have
to do with the pheromones they are probably releasing? Are they reacting to
a stable cloud they create, "reading" the pheromones? The geometry also a
"text"?

Gnat swarming behavior

The following video was made about 100 meters from the Jordan River trail
in Salt Lake City (West Jordan / Midvale), Utah. The site is a pond per-
haps one or two acres across; there are numerous birds (swallows, swifts,
red-wing and yellow-head blackbirds, etc.) around. When I first saw the
gnats, near sundown, they swarmed in a typical ellipsoidal fashion, i.e.
similar to a free-falling water balloon in slow motion. I noticed several
columns forming; in a short while, they became vertical, long and narrow.
They swayed and held shape. In gnat swarms, males and females behave
differently; in one of the vertical columns, a roughly spherical 'head' is
visible to one side, and I wonder if there might be sexual differentiation
here. What is fascinating to me is the relationship of millions of gnats
to an over-arching geometry; this parallels slime mold behavior to some
extent. I've seen lots of gnat swarms before, but nothing like this. We're
leaving the Salt Lake City area today, so I have no time to investigate
this further at the moment (we're leaving today), but I'm interested in
any further input, images, videos, you might have.

It is "Here is another formation in columns," not "formation in colors."

Alan,

Forgive one non-scientific take, your video reminded me of the appearance of
angels in some 19th century photos, particularly the section where one
column of "light" appears in the background. Do the swarm of gnats,
physically speaking, follow the same laws as the movement of a tornado?.

Here is another formation in colors:


immense pool            o

The ghosts at play beneath my skin
kill all happy thoughts. Children wither
down to sog and blisters

out on the street, under my touch.
My loving is a black cataclysm;
nympholepsy for leper’s bread.

I’ve staggered into light before:
when I was young, before all
the touching dried up, I played
the colors in my big American
backyard, blowing Spring
birds that never hung
around long enough to get
my name.

The ghosts at play beneath my skin
shake their candy-hot wings.
My nights, crowded with zombie sugar:

my dawns, doused with hounds

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

We are pleased to announce that PENNsound will be hiring a MANAGING
EDITOR. This is a part-time job - 20 hours per week. The job will begin in
August or early September, depending on the successful candidate's
availability. The position will run 48-50 weeks per year, although summer
hours are negotiable.

The MANAGING EDITOR will work with us, as PENNsound's co-Directors, and
also with Mark Lindsay (CPCW's IT Manager and PENNsound's Managing
Director).

With Mark, the MANAGING EDITOR will coordinate the work being done by
work-study students and others who help us produce digital audio (and some
video) recordings of poets reading their poems and discussing poetry and
poetics. The MANAGING EDITOR will also reach out to poets who are
contributing recordings of their work, arrange necessary permissions,
answering users' and poets' queries, help direct updates to the site, work
with Penn's library on cataloging projects, and help curatorially to shape
the direction of the archive.

Candidates should be familiar with (or able to learn quickly) how to work
with digital audio materials, the ins and outs of a web site such as
PENNsound's, and the management of student workers and volunteers.
Candidates should also be somewhat familiar or perhaps very familiar with
modern and contemporary poetry.

Candidates are asked to familiarize themselves with the PENNsound project
by exploring

	http://writing.upenn/edu/pennsound .

To apply, please send a cover letter and c.v./resume to:

	Mingo Reynolds
	Associate Director for Administration
	Center for Programs in Contemporary Writing
	3808 Locust Walk
	University of Pennsylvania

at this email address:  mingo@writing.upenn.edu.

The cover letter should briefly describe relevant experience (tech plus
poetry) and availability.

Best wishes,

Al Filreis & Charles Bernstein

It does have to do with that, from what I gather. But I wouldn't think the
geometry's a text; the geometry's a residue; 'text' seems too overde-

Re: Tornado - not at all; the tornado responds to external atmospheric
vacuum/pressures in combination with coriolis forces. On the other hand, I
think meteorological computer programs work with 3d pixels each responding
to their neighbors (I may be wrong here), in which case you're right. On
the other hand, the gnat swarm may 'look like' a tornado but it's respon-
ding to vastly different things. You might want to look for pheromone
gradiants across the column, but I doubt they'd map into the pressure
gradiants in any meaningful way. The tornado always takes more or less the
same form; the gnat swarms are far more supple. Something seemed to
trigger the column from the more ellipsoidal form; I'm not sure what that
is.

I think I mentioned that the swarms are mating swarms, and males and
females take different intersecting trajectories through them. I noticed
they paid no attention to me; unlike mosquitoes which are attracted to
CO2, the swarms continued around me when I slowly breathed out. The
pheronomes must be of a different order altogether.

Sorry for the fuzziness, far too worn out

- Alan

  TELEGRAPH
  by Kaya Oakes
  ISBN: 978-1-886350-43-4
  Winner of the Transcontinental Poetry Prize (editor's choice, 2006)
  80 pages, 6 by 9
  $14

  Kaya Oakes' work has appeared in Conduit, Volt, MiPoesias, Coconut, Shampoo, and many other journals. The recipient of awards and grants from the Academy of American Poets and the Bay Area Writing Project, she is also the senior editor of Kitchen Sink Magazine, and she teaches writing at the University of California, Berkeley.


  First books often offer versions of resurrection and Kaya Oakes' moving debut in TELEGRAPH charts a coming back to life with uncompromising lucidity and sorrow. In poetry rife with a bodily knowledge of the inherent “second-ness” of women’s history, Oakes writes for the one and the many, Elektra her guide in the passage. “I wonder if this earth meant anything when I leant my form to it,” the personae wonders in the final poem, and wonderfully, readers will find that it does, thanks to the earnest care of Kaya Oakes' making.
--Claudia Keelan


  ---------------------------------------

  Elektra in the offices


  Barefoot and ripe with new embarrassment
  Elektra walks up three floors, trying not to sweat


  Constriction in her thighs, those red bands drawn tight
  and everyone who waited without knowing her was blind
  would receive her in a spotless blackness reserved
  for those who have forgotten seeing means we learned to feel
  in blindness, too.


  You ought to have gone with her, years ago.
  That was when it was easier to feel through things
  by pulling those last strands of someone’s hair


  and wrapping up your fingers with them, like a tourniquet.
  Elektra cuts her hair in bathrooms where her shape is strange
  where the windows stay shut, even on the hottest nights
  nail scissors in half-drunk bathrooms where she doesn’t live.


  While shots go off outside, the scissors scrape and pull.
  She climbs the stairs climbed so many times before.
  She has no one on her side,


  she has handwriting and flowers gathered
  in a backyard where her scalp burned pink
  while the afternoons fed anorexic evenings
  and the day’s fluorescence never dimmed;


  unsure, unripe, unready. Still the pounding rocks her steps
  as innocents file past her. One hand, one knife,
  one brother burning somewhere in the city,
  The man is upstairs, working,
  or failing at his work and practicing his oaths.
  But nothing stops the inevitable click
  of the door that yields to business.



Be well

Not clear what topics your looking for but here's a weekly podcast
out of UCSF science department...

http://www.ucsf.edu/sciencecafe/

I had read that the UC system was considering release a large amount
of lectures as podcasts, but I can't seem to pull that up right now.

Recordings of talks by John Cage, I think, would be great for listening
while walking. Also David Antin's talks. Gertrude Stein lectures. There
must be lots of others, historical & barely-old-enough-to-be-recorded. But
I doubt that anyone has thought of them as "to walk by" or organized or
rated them as such, so I'm not surprised that they don't show up that way
on google. I would think the place you are walking would make a difference,
i.e. there is at least one section of Zukofsky's "A" (I'm thinking 15 but I
don't have the book with me right now), which would be great for a
particular New York walk. Or certain parts of Nichol's The Martyrology for
some western Canadian walks. And what about Stephen Vincent's terrific new
book, Walking Theory, for San Francisco walks (but not limited to that
locale). And for something somewhat (but not completely) more virtual, what
about Lisa Robertson's Occasional Work and Seven Walks from the Office of
Soft Architecture (that office being one she maintained "as an apparatus
for lyrical research, constructing propositions and documents for the
advancement of a natural history of civic surface," focused primarily in
Vancouver, with some excursions to other places. Locally (Tucson), I've
heard Lisa Cooper read from works referencing specific points and histories
in Tucson that would be great for local walks (but not in late June please,
no not until about October).

Jim, maybe you should compile a guide to such walking works, or someone
should research putting a collection together, either on CD or downloadable.

I knew I was going to miss a region or two -- you're talking about the =
Highway 10 corridor up through Big Lake to St. Joe's, Collegeville, =
Charles Lindbergh & Sinclair Lewis country, etc.? forgive me if that's =
too broad...

two points of interest I know of in that neck of the woods are the =
Gardens of Eternity (? not sure of the name) in Sauk Rapids, which is =
one of a scant few visionary art environments I know of in Minnesota; =
and the St. Urho statue in Menahga (part of the "Finnish Triangle") -- =
http://www.roadsideamerica.com/sights/sightstory.php?tip_AttrId=3D%3D1146=

worth a visit too: the brutalist St. John's Abbey Church (designed by =
Marcel Breuer) -- =
http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/St_Johns_Abbey.html=20

as you can see, I relate to the region in terms of pilgrimage sites -- =
if it was worth writing about in the 1938 WPA guide (or would have been, =
had the guide been written today), it's usually something I want to =
check out.=20
