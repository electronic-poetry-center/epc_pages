The way forward in creative writing theory


Creative Writing: Theory beyond practice

Nigel Krauth & Tess Brady (editors)



Creative Writing: Theory beyond practice is a collection of new major essay=
s
by international scholars and sets the agenda for creative writing studies
in the next ten years.



Here writers, teachers and theorists identify theoretical underpinnings for
creativity and writing in a broad spectrum of experience =96 architecture,
psychology, ecology, philosophy, physiology, love, morality, sculpture and
the body. This new research lays innovative foundations for insight into th=
e
nature of writing.



A book for practitioners, teachers and students, it prepares a way for
understanding the frameworks in which creative writing takes place in the
early twenty-first century. New major essays from:



Inez Baranay; Tess Brady; Donna Lee Brien; Kevin Brophy; Paul Dawson; Brian
Dibble; Marcelle Freiman; Anna Gibbs; Nigel Krauth; Jeri Kroll; Lance Olsen=

*Critical Documents*

Critical Documents was started in 2005 by jUStin!katKO. It publishes the
journal Plantarchy as well as chapbooks of contemporary poetry. Plantarchy
brings together the work of established and emerging practitioners from the
U.K. and U.S. Whenever possible, the editorial agenda is to print sequences
or longish excerpts of work. Issue 3, consisting solely of cris cheek's The
Church =AD The School =AD The Beer will be released at Boog City's Critical
Documents evening in NYC on December 7th. Plantarchy is available at Bridge
Street (DC), Rust Belt (Buffalo), Talking Leaves (Buffalo), Normal's
(Baltimore), City Lights (San Francisco), and Woodland Pattern (Milwaukee).
It is archived at SUNY-Buffalo, the University of Kansas, Ohio State
University, and the Marvin Sackner Archive.

*Performer Bios*

**cris cheek is a poet, writer, book artist, publisher, new media
practitioner, talker, and interdisciplinary performer whose writing has bee=
n
commissioned and shown all over the western world, often in multiple
versions using diverse media for production and circulation. The work has a=
n
increasingly site-responsive proclivity and is frequently created in forms
of collaboration with other artists. He collaborates with Kirsten Lavers
under the name TNWK. The Church =AD The School =AD The Beer is a book of talks
being released from Critical Documents.

**William R. Howe is a poet, book artist, publisher, editor, performance
artist, and visual artist. He is a visiting assistant professor at Miami
University of Ohio, in Oxford, Ohio. His work, which most often appears in
small event-based editions, has also appeared in Plantarchy, Mirage
#4/Period(ical), Ferrum Wheel, The Gig, and others. Along with cris cheek
and Keith Tuma, he has been accused of being a heretic. He runs the
Putitupor broadside series, and he and his wife, L.A. Howe, edit Slack
Buddha Press.

**Brenda Iijima is the author of Around Sea (O Books). Animate, Inanimate,
Inanimate Aims is forthcoming from Litmus Press and Eco Quarry Bellwether i=
s
forthcoming from Outside Voices. A chapbook, Rabbit Lesson will be publishe=
d
by Fewer & Further Press. She is the editor of Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs=
.
Iijima is also a visual artist.

**jUStin!katKO is an intermedia writer and publisher. He has collaborated o=
n
videos and text with Keith Tuma and collaborates with Camille PB under the
collective alias Coupons-Coupons. He co-operates Meshworks: the Miami
University Archive of Writing in Performance, co-edits On Company Time with
Keston Sutherland, and edits the poetry journal Plantarchy (Critical
Documents).

**Mark Mendoza tries hard to listen in Oxford, OH.

Postmodern British Poetry and American Readers and various essays on poetry=
,
poetics, and culture. He is the editor of Anthology of Twentieth Century
British and Irish Poetry and Rainbow Darkness, an anthology of African
American poetry and essays about it, and co-editor of books on Mina Loy and

poem and travelogue Critical Path: Into the Bush. Some of his recent poems
are collected in the chapbook Topical Ointment. He is professor and chair o=
f
the department of English at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.

**Jason Zeh, a magnetic cassette tape composer and Xerox artist from Bowlin=
g
Green, Ohio, creates music that successfully combines elements of drone,
electro-acoustic, and noise. Zeh=B9s work relies on the creation of intimate
social encounters through the use of extreme quiet punctuated by steep
inclines toward moments of extreme loudness. Live shows combine a mixing of
previously recorded source sounds with real time manipulation of cassette
tape through the use of modified tape decks and dismantled cassettes. The
relationship Zeh has to the cassettes and tape decks used to record and
manipulate the sounds is not unlike that of many laptop artists in terms of
the meticulous sculpting of sound that is employed in order to create
emotionally charged and aesthetically dynamic compositions without the
stifled and overly technical feel of some electronic music produced by
computers. Zeh has performed throughout the midwest and east and west coast=
s
with noise artists such as John Wiese, Wolf Eyes, Burning Star Core, Hair
Police, Jessica Rylan, Withdrawal Method, Daniel Menche, The Cherry Point,
and Peter B, and he has toured with Mike Shiflet, SIXES, Cotton Museum,
Gerritt, Leslie Keffer, 2673, and Jesse Kudler.

Alex,

I don't have any more information on him than a quick Google reveals, but I
want to thank you for piquing my interest w/ your enthusiasm. The online poems
I've found corroborate everything you've said, and I've ordered the book. I'm
grateful for the new discovery.

Joe Francis Doerr

I think this gentleman is one of the most relevant and
compelling voices in poetry today. For me, this what
I've been looking for - no smoke and mirrors, no slack
poetry designed to serve an otherwise incestuous
cliche of bad poetry mongers, to slight of hand that
leaves readers thinking they just came (but didn't).

Can anyone provide me with additional information,
because I've just stumbled upon his work. Back
channel. Where can I find him. Time, I will appreciate
it!

Alex

Alan,

You sound like a Mediaval monk transcribing/translating/recording/preserving
manuscripts - which in some ways you are- with a dash of Sufism added ("an
entire universe of pixels, of
which this, and this and that, are an infinitesimal part").

Ciao,

Murat

i can't slow up. death is an hysteria. i don't care about your gender. i
send out work as soon as it's done. i make work as soon as i think of it.
i read as fast as i can. i watch news and practice music while i read. i
know if i slow up i'll die. i know there will be a missive or missile here
in this space that will not be sent. i know the missive will be the tag or
curlicue. i know it will be the conjunction of my death. i read the con-
junction as not both life and death. i read the conjunction as neither
life nor death. i eat fast. i never sleep properly. i dream theory and
practice. i hunt on the internet. i shape ride on the internet. i speak
here and do not speak elsewhere. speech is a privilege. i cannot pronounce

speech. i breath fast. i get out of breath fast. death promises slowing.
death does not halt. i watch myself as i speak. i watch myself as i
remember. i remember remembering. i remember what i have forgotten. i
watch my brain at work. i remember watching. i know what i forget will be
my last. i know if i forgot i should be reminded to die. i am afraid of

before i can no longer play music. i want to get out this absolute music.
i want to theorize as bulwark and therapeutic. i want to theorize before i

make that video when i think of the video. i edit that video while i make
that video. i am afraid of passing out. i am afraid of dizziness. i speed
through dizziness. if i stop i will die. if i die this thought will not be
finished. i must finish this thought. i have a new thought now.

FIRST PERSON QUEER:
Who We Are, Where We've Come From, Where We're Going

edited by Richard Labont=E9 and Lawrence Schimel
for publication in Fall 2007 by Arsenal Pulp Press

We're looking for short (under 1500 words) first
person essays from across the spectrum of queer
experience that depict the diversity, the complexity,
and the excitement of contemporary GLBTQ life. We want
to be surprised, and to surprise our readers, with
intensely personal experiences from writers of diverse
genders, ages, races, and orientations, informing us
about unusual aspects of our lives. Comprehending
queer codes, exulting in nonconformity, expressing
gender deviance, confronting assimilation, having to
"pass": write about the theory of your life. Discuss
sissyhood, parenting skills, sexual experiences (play
or work), urban pleasures, personal choices: write
about the practice of your life. We've all got a story
to tell. Share yours. Express your "I".

Topic and tone=97witty, reflective, satirical,
learned=97are open to your imaginations, as long as the
writing is real. What's going to make us sit up and
pay attention are essays that go beyond the
traditional tales of coming out, first love, breaking
up, the death of a lover, the acceptance=97or not=97of
parents. These are important stories, and intriguing
twists on them will be considered, but they=92ve been
done; we're unlikely to include more than one or two.
So: offer us something different, something less easy
to categorize. Give us a glimpse of an instructive
physical moment or a transcendent emotional passage
from your dyke, fag, tranny, bi, or otherwise queer
life. Prose or graphic/comix narratives, no poetry.

Submit your work by email, as an attachment in .doc
format, with author's last name and story title in the
file name: Surname-Title.doc, to Richard Labont=E9 at:
fpqueer@gmail. <mailto:fpqueer%40gmail.com> com

Please include contact details and bio in the .doc
file, not just in your email; submissions that are
considered will be separated from the emails.

Deadline: Feb. 28, 2007.

Payment: a small honorarium and one copy of the book
will be paid. (Please note that payment is in
Canadian funds.)=20

As an anthology for a Canadian publisher, preference
will be given to submissions from Canadian writers.=20
But the anthology is open to submissions from all
writers, and is actively interested in non-North
American writers.

        The Garden Hears

A gardener hears this conversation
("what about the one who makes it heard?")
a flower was asking the garden one night.
("I am condemned to this because of you,
and why were you?")
and the garden pointingo the house, it smiled
("may be someone may need to take a flower
to the cemetary?")
since then, as if closing the lid of a coffin,
I lock the door of the house.


Alan,

Amazing, for the the issue is an irresistible passivity.

Ciao,

Murat

of _C=E9sar Vallejo: The Complete Posthumous Poetry=20
_and _Aim=E9 C=E9saire: The Collected Poetry, _both=20
from UC Press. Among <B>Mario Vargas Llosa</B>'s=20
prestigious literary awards are the National=20
Critics' Prize, the Peruvian National Prize, and=20
the Miguel de Cervantes Prize. He is the author=20
of more than twenty books. <B>Efrain Kristal=20

University of California, Los Angeles. <B>Stephen=20
M. Hart </B>is Professor of Spanish and Latin=20
American Studies at University College, London.

"Only the dauntless perseverance and the love=20
with which the translator has dedicated so many=20
years of his life to this task can explain why=20
the English version conveys, in all its boldness=20
and vigor, the unmistakable voice of C=E9sar=20
Vallejo."-Mario Vargas Llosa

"Decades in the making, this faithful and=20
forceful complete text from poet and essayist=20
Eshleman deserves as much notice as any poetic=20
translation can get."-_Publishers Weekly_

This first translation of the complete poetry of=20
Peruvian C=E9sar Vallejo (1892-1938) makes=20
available to English speakers one of the greatest=20
achievements of twentieth-century world poetry.=20
Handsomely presented in facing-page Spanish and=20
English, this volume, translated by National Book=20
Award winner Clayton Eshleman, includes the=20
groundbreaking collections _The Black Heralds=20
_(1918), _Trilce _(1922), _Human Poems _(1939),=20
and _Spain, Take This Cup from Me _(1939).
Vallejo's poetry takes the Spanish language to an=20
unprecedented level of emotional rawness and=20
stretches its grammatical possibilities. Striking=20
against theology with the very rhetoric of the=20
Christian faith, Vallejo's is a tragic=20
vision-perhaps the only one in the canon of=20
Spanish-language literature-in which salvation=20
and sin are one and the same. This edition=20
includes notes on the translation and a=20
fascinating translation memoir that traces=20
Eshleman's long relationship with Vallejo's=20
poetry. An introduction and chronology provide=20

dear list my new book the final nite has been reviewed thankfully
favorably in many places

the latest is the great ny free newspaper the brooklyn rail  nov issue

here's the catch however the poems are essentially about a jazz musician
actually written over a period of 29 yrs while listening to him play

therer fore they stuck the review in the music section instead of the
poetry section

go figure   enjoy it if you can  find it   sd

but is usually right there on the page-- the address to go to find out--
usually by clicking on their web site, as with the Tarpaulin Sky

just thought wd point it out to save you time & anxiety--
and feeling like chicken with head cut off--

I could swear I remember reading Allen Ginsberg describing himself somewhere
as a "Jewish Buddhist Pantheist." If anyone recalls where this phrase might
have turned up I will be ever so grateful.you can backchannel me at

1st, i need any thoughts or suggestions about any single stein text that

the work's publication history or variant versions etc (but this is in

published by Ulla Dydo.  I don't recall the titile offhand.

And make sure you have a look at Ulla Dydo's terrific book, Gertrude Stein:=

The Language That Rises. She has a good deal to say about different=20
versions of particular pieces by Stein that she covers.

In Lyn Hejinian's book of critical essays, The Language of Inquiry, she
writes considerable on Stein's work and language practice. I found it very
readable and helpful to a reading of Stein - particularly, if I remember
right, Stein's way of making paragraphs and correlating that to a painter
working on a canvas, cubists, sans doute!

A very worthwhile book in its on write/right/(UC Press, 2000) - gosh, how
time flies (or freezes) that was back at the start of this war monger's
palace. Detritus, it seems, has become the only 'game' (evidence) in town!

Stephen's right, Mark. Hejinian is great reading.
Let me add the chapter "Gertrude Stein's Differential Syntax" of Marjorie
Perloff's 21st-Century Modernism, Blackwell, 2002 ; Charles Bernstein's
"Professing Stein / Stein Professing" in his A Poetics, Harvard UP 1992.
And, speaking of Bernstein, although the following is not a theoretical
piece, have a go at the delectable "Gertrude and Ludwig's Bogus Adventure",
from My Way, Univ. of Chicago Press, 1999. But, back to criticism and
textual studies. In the same volume by Bernstein (My Way), you'll find the
chapter on "Stein's Identity". Chapter 4 of Bob Perelman's The Trouble With
Genius: Reading Pound, Joyce, Stein and Zukofsky (Univ. of Calif. Press,
1994) is worth reading too...
That's all I have in mind for the moment.
Michael

I found that when I was teaching English some parents just didn't want
to have certain conversations with their children, so they didn't want
certain things brought up in the classroom.  Kinda scary, to me.

But, sometimes, the parents need the education just as well as their
children.

This is very cool!

A title that I've been tossing around has only a 26.3% chance if taken
figuratively, but a 35.9% chance if taken literally.

Weird.

I wouldn't imagine anyone to take it literally.

I imagine a million people have chimed in on this already, but "tender buttons" is the book to do the work on, there have only been a few editions of
that since the original self published version, but it's a great piece of work and I know a bunch of the Language Poets have written pretty
extensively about it, and there's an extended bit of writing on it in either Wittgenstein's Ladder or 21st Century Modernism by Marjorie Perloff.

Wow----I guess Stein is a one-hit wonder after all (in addition to
being a language poet)....

Apart from the excellent Library of America Edition of Stein's Works, the
Penguin Modcern Classic compendium of Writings and Lectures 1909-45 edited
by Patricia Meyerowitz can certainly still be found (my reprint is dated
1984). It contains Tender Buttons. Around Tender Buttons, Mark, your friend=
,
may want to look at "The Gradual Making of 'The Making of Americans'",
"Portraits and Repetition" and "Poetry and Grammar". All in Look At Me And
Here I Am

Folks,

now that the estimable Ms. Perloff is President of the MLA, poetry is back in the academic spotlight...I'm wondering, though, if the usual annual alterna-reading/open mic will be happening?  Anybody have the details?

Email me.

Yes. I was wondering the same thing. As a third of Lit City, I was the primary organizer of those readings when the MLA was held in New Orleans in 2001, and I would love to read in Philly this year. If you could please forward me information, as well, I would appreciate it.

 Thanks,

 Tod

For those of you who don't see the New York Times, this morning's issue carries a short notice of a new CD from Steve Swallow that continues his earlier work with the poetry of Robert Creeley -- The new one includes what must be nearly the last recordings of Creeley's own reading voice -- and the music is composed out of Creeley's own rhythms --

here's a link to the Amazon description of the CD:

Thanx very much to everyone who has responded to my inquiry re Stein !
my friend has found many of the comments helpful,  but has written me to
clarify ...  i believe that he and i are jointly responsible for the
initial post not being sufficiently clear;  he's in graduate school and
his assignment for this paper is primarily about
textual-editing/textual-history issues;  so when he wrote:

" of particular interest are any textual studies discussing
the work's publication history or variant versions etc"

he actually should have stressed that part of things even more than he
did;  ... and:  ignore the comment which comes after  ("but this is not
particularly crucial");  i believe he meant that to apply to "variant
versions,"  not the rest of the preceding sentence !   so while he has
read people's responses with interest,  and is grateful,  he really is
trying to find not so much insightful criticism on Stein as a
poet/writer,   as textual scholarship,  stuff relating to the
establishment of Stein's texts .......

Thanx again !!

I've just learned that our friend and correspondent for lo these many

i made an attempt to organize one from long distance and encountered
some trouble working around the many events DR. perloff (philip, i
love you, and i'm sure you were being sly, but women are so endlessly
demoted in these things) has scheduled. and i could not discover when
the usual alphabet-soup reading would be, but i took a wild guess
given an opening on the schedule and figgered the 28th. (organizers
did not get back to me on this so don't take that to the bank.) based
on this logic, the only time i could find that would not be terribly
intrusive was the 27th at 7:00, but my concern was that too many
would not yet be in town. so i did not move forward with trying to
find a space.

perhaps someone local could pitch in....?

This is very sad: where was she when she died?  her activism and
poetry was v inspiring. i only met her once, at the San Francisco Bay
Area Poetry Marathon, thanks to Joseph Lease and Donna de la Perriere
for organizing it.

Kari was absolutely brilliant and her work had an edge to it that was
absolutely unique. This is a terrible loss; even without the quality of
her writing, it is terrible...

This is a bad season for death and illness; we're dealing with some family
here as well.

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present a reading by

Ted Pelton & Camille Roy

Friday, December 8, 2006 at 7:30 PM

Ted Pelton is the author of three books, most recently the novel Malcolm and
Jack (Spuyten Duyvil, 2006), which Cris Mazza says “reminds us of the quagmire
that is history.  Fact and fiction can't be easily boxed; everything is true
even as everything isn't.  Don't even bother trying to pinch yourself every so
often while reading to see if it’s ‘real.’ Pelton’s book does the pinching for
you.” Pelton is the publisher of Starcherone Books and teaches at Medaille
College of Buffalo.


Camille Roy is a writer and performer of plays, poetry, and fiction. Her two
most recent books are Cheap Speech, a play, from Leroy, and Craquer, from 2nd
Story Books (both 2002). Her book Swarm (two novellas) was published by San
Francisco's Black Star Series with funding from the San Francisco Arts
Commission. She is a founding editor of the online journal Narrativity.
Girlfriends magazine says “Camille Roy is as brilliant and horny as William S.
Burroughs with his consciousness way raised” and Robert Gluck calls hers
“gorgeously perverse…starstruck langugage.”



Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to current SPT
members and CCA faculty, staff, and students.

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in Timken Lecture Hall,
California College of the Arts 1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the
intersection of 16th & Wisconsin)

This is not something for a quick reasearch paper but since the topic
of Stein is out--i just thought that i'd mention my own nerdy research
into Stein and Whitehead--one main part of it being a thought that
that the phrase: "Tender Buttons" was partially referring to (or
cripped) from Whitehead's religous writings which speaks of G-d as
"with tender patience leading..."

I'd love to hear agreements or disagreements about this it's a bit of
a "hallucinated connection" still but Whitehead does have some great
discussions of occasions and ingredients which make reading Tender
Buttons much more exciting for me.

Reading William Jame's Principles of Psychology helps amazingly too in
understanding the far-from-simple intervention that Stein makes into
Cubist projects.

but i could talk everyone's ears off for a very long time about this...

Speaking up: a proud, artsy former Eagle Scout here... forced to it, though,
by my military stepdad: I admit I would have quit otherwise. Gerald R. Ford
machine-signed my certificate! I have another poet-friend who also holds the
badge... and I will also add that knot-tying and poetry-writing have always
seemed remarkably similar acts of imaginiation, to me...

Eireene,
I don't feel qualified to agree or disagree with the Stein-Whitehead
connection. I'm more at ease to agree entirely with you on James. All I may
do is show extreme interest in your hypothesis. The close Olson-Whitehead
connection is textually explicit (in Maximus and in letters) and has been
efficiently explored by Shahar Bram. Did you manage to find evidence of
Stein's reading of Whitehead? Or on which parallels are you working on? I
wish you could tell us some more.
My ears can endure that much for the benefit of my brain....
Michael

Yes, it's true about kari's death and here in the Bay Area we are all
still in shock as I imagine her friends all over the country and
elsewhere are as well.

Fran Blau asked me to spread the word about, well, something you can
do in kari's memory if you care to, and that's to make a donation to
Cinema Paradiso, the international cinema in Auroville, the visionary
community in southern India where kari and Fran had spent a happy
year + together.

Checks should be made out to:
Auroville Maintenance Fund
and sent to:
Financial Services
Town Hall Annex
Auroville 605101
Tamil Nadu
India

Please note that it's to support "Cinema Paradiso" and that your gift
is in memory of kari edwards.

Thanks everyone.  If anyone needs an update or whatever feel free to
get in touch with me,

Kevin K.

in the autobiography of alice b. toklas, whitehead is one of the three
people that stein met and heard the bells that announced she was meeting a
genius

(so one imagines yes she read his work, too--he was ver ywell known  in that
time--his photo for example wd show up in vanity fair, etc--)

it is interesting reading the responses to the query--i was thinking how the
works cited for the much greater part are al those which related Stein with
language poetry only, from that particular perspective--
as though there had been no work on her previously--though there is indeed
quite a lot--
and from people writing from a great many perspectives, including many
important views from artists working in other media who learmed from/worked
with Stein's work and her in person--and this beginning very early in her
career--(the large correspondance with sherwood anderson for example, of an
early one--)

i am well aware of Stein's great effect on language poetry, beginning with
robert grenier, who was teaching the yale stein at franconia college ealry
1970s--but at same time seems like limiting the worship of a goddess to one
sect  among a great many--and work on her limited to that begun with just
one persepctive's interpretation of the canon--
(thinking of this as humourous--so , please, not saying this to raise ire)
then later on today on yahoo newspager saw a story that in kenya
fundamentalist christian sects pushing very hard on govt that when museum
reopens, its world famous and one of most important exhibitions of earliest
skeletons of hominds and homo sapiens--instead of being promiently
displayed, be removed and put away into back rooms--where only the intrepid
wil follow after in the dimness to view them--that evolution is not fact,
but only a theory--

i couldn't help laughing, as this seems the situation with gertrude stein
here--
there is no evolution in work on her work, or with her work--
only a creation out of a vacuum--and all stein work begining from
there--that moment, and done by the members of that sect born of the
revelation of that moment--and their students, disciples, acolytes etc--

a great deal can be learned directly from stein--she is very clear in
explaining her ideas--in her essays and compositions--
she lays  her major concerns very straight forwardly----objects, landscapes,
geographies, the swifter and swfiter pasage of things being seen as ugly to
theirbeing seen as beaitufl and accpeted into daily mas production using
their images, ideas--etc--
she also wrote a great deal about the influence of painting on her
work--that is very interesting--and crucial in the development of her early
writing--
again, from very ealryon stein was written abt a goo deal by other writers
infouenced by her, influencing her, interested in her work and vice
cersa--and a great deal can be found in their coreespondance and wirtings in
this reagrd still of great interest and use--

as wel as great deal that has been written on the interrelatednessness of
stein's early work s esp in relation to painting, the wys painters were
changng language in painting, and ways of seeing things in space and how
this relates with time, space-time --

which is vey intersting and different from what is often the case, as brion
gysin told willaim s burroughs--that writing lags fifty years behind
painting--if so, why then not be learning from painters, which is what stein
was doing much of--

Kari Edwards' activities are well-known, and I think
it no overstatement to say that her substantial spirit
has and will continue to empower.

During this past year, following what was my first
introduction, sad to say, of her work, an issue of
'One Less' we shared - she, a wise and seasoned pro,
me, certainly an amateur - I would subsequently become
better aware of her graciousness (as she would offer
to assist me in India and see, if she was able, to
make it to a reading - 'now that I was on her list').

It's terrible, I think, how so much time is often
relegated to simply waiting for more opportune moments
to say, well, thank you - or to make that contact,
very human one, where we are able to simply find the
space in which to honor and be truly aware. At this
moment, as has been said by many already, one is left
but to recoil and contemplate lots.

1. About the Poetics List
2. Posting to the List
3. Subscriptions
4. Subscription Options
5. To Unsubscribe
6. Cautions

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has about 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep
in mind the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect
our decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of
modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do
what is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv
editorial board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which
calls for all messages to be read and approved before being forwarded
to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the
spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the editorial board will unsubscribe individuals if
they are not, in our opinion, productively contributing to the list or
following our guidelines. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about
this list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists.
The idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather
than general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list
relatively small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the
list are generally 50 messages per day, and one or two messages per
subscriber per day; but these limits are subject to change withouth
notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the
EPC.


2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series,
and blogs that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this
list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications (print or
digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal
entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly
to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in
automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.


6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes
competing interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with
our collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 50 or fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

The Invented Life of Kitty Duncan
 (Benedict Roberts Duncan)
a novel by
 Kat Meads

"Hold onto your hats, ladies and gents, you are about to meet some
folks you won't soon forget, even if you want to.  Kat Meads's
hilarious and  hair-raising tale of Kitty Duncan's recless and willful
descent into perdition is an irresistible one.  Maybe Meads isn't
reinventing the novel here, but she's surely finding marvelous new
ways to shape it.  She's like some instrument, and blasts one amazing
and unexpected chord after another, alarming us with her narrative
bravado and enchanting us with her strange and haunting melody.  The
Invented Life of Kitty Duncan (Benedict Roberts Duncan) is a wild
ride, indeed, a breathtaking and edgy romp.
    --John Dufresne, author of Johnny Too Bad

"Taut, incisive and sardonic, crisp yet droll, Kat Meads's quirky
fiction has an open-door policy allowing emotion, pathos and drama to
come inside, to visit for a while, to watch from the sidelines, or put
their hands around your throat."
    --Cris Mazza, author of Is It Sexual Harassment Yet? And Waterbaby

Kat Meads is the author of Sleep, Not Waving, Born Southern and
Restless, and other works of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.  She has
received a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, a Fine Arts

I am reading this now, it is a shock. She promised she was going to send me
a mail, and I was waiting for it. She had told me she was not well.
I am very very sorry. I hope there is a way, and that she will find it.

I knew kari.  I'm totally in shock.

I'm trying to remember the last time I saw her: I think it was at/after a
reading in the Left Hand series in Boulder.  This would have been a few
years ago.

This is a major loss, as others have expressed.  Her project seemed to
particularly take shape & momentum within the last several years.  Too soon.
  This is a sad day.

As an addendum, I also knew Brad Will, whose death has been discussed in
other threads on this list.  His death also struck me personally; I was
going to post something on this list about it, including an elegy I wrote
for him, and collaborative poems he, I & Danika Dinsmore wrote, once upon a
time; but I grew too busy, & now the moment seems to have already passed.

I mourn the deaths of people I never imagined could pass so swiftly.  I hope
the powers of whatever-will-be shall forestall such useless loss, at least
for now or in the future.

Hey Geoffrey,

Thanks for putting the book online!  I'd really like to read it.
Unfortunately, I just spent at least 40 minutes  trying to download it...
unsuccessfully.  (I have OS9 connected by a phone line.)  Is there any way I
could trouble you to e-mail it to me?

Thanks,

Mark

Tragic News - kari edwards


It was announced over our many poetry lists that a dear friend an d
brilliant poet, kari edwards passed a short while ago. I was working with
her on her latest book, having been blue for charity. We were set to release
it shortly. And with no motive other a coming together for her we have
placed this book online as an ebook at her BlazeVOX [books]
webpage.

Webpage:

Direct link to book

http://www.blazevox.org/ebk-ke.pdf

This is simply a stunning book and I urge you to spend a moment with kari's
poetry. I don't know what else to say as I am numb.

Thank you, Geoffrey Gatza

Best, Geoffrey

Hi Mark,

Glad to hear from you :-) And thanks for the kind words in regards to kari's
book. A real loss! I'm simply heart sick over this. And I wasn't sure about
the appropriateness of releasing the ebook. So again thanks for easing my
mind.

I'll attach the file to my next email to you. It is a large file and it
sounds like it might take a while on your phone line. It's about 3.5 megs.
So if you want me to send you a print copy I'll do that. It'll be ready in a
month or so. But that seems so long.... I'll email it after hearing back
from you if it's ok to do this :-)

OR

Right click on this link and choose SAVE AS

http://www.blazevox.org/ebk-ke.pdf

This is cause it to download directly to your computer desktop and you can
open it from there. Try this and see if it works.


I also owe you an email on books. Please no worries on my end on anything.
Your time table is so well timed with the other things going on with the
press -- you are very on-time :-) So your patience gets a gold star in my
book.

I'll send you an updated file with your ISBN and so forth this week
sometime. Maybe today. But please don't feel anything other than
comfortable. There is no rush on anything and this is not homework. Besides
I'm a huge fan of your work and I am thrilled that we are working together!
So hurrah on a bad day.



Best, Geoffrey

wow! thank you david. that is plenty more than i knew.

what books exactly are they where gertrude (or others)  talk about the
transformation of langauge by painting's new relationship to time (or
whatever it is that they say)? lots of reading still to do on this.

the main (favorite book) that i have read on this is Gleizes and
Metzinger's "On Cubism" which has been important in trying to think
about time through our little discussed human proprioceptive senses

but my wee brain always falls off some sort of a cliff before I get
back to proprioception and langauge (probably because I always try to
go at it through Duchamp...& if anyone has any favorite works on him
(and optics and eternal return) i'm hoping to get back to that paper
again later too.

and well i still advocate for whitehead, not to replace gertrude, but
to help us think about writing in this process philosophy way. it is
really good stuff in a way more helpful (for me anyhow) than the
bergson that people always seem to cling to. but maybe i am missing
something big about him?

to more good discussions of all of this.

A writing practice group will begin on Thursday, December 7 at noon at Star=

suggested exercises in Writing Down The Bones. Writers in all genres, ficti=
on and non-

 sentence or
a sentence fragment or a word). The start lines  are put in a hat or a bowl=
 and we draw
them out for each writing segment. The  segments are timed: five minutes fo=
r the first
and then writers have the opportunity to read what they=E2=80=99ve written =
if they choose. They
can also pass. The next segments last ten minutes, fifteen minutes, twenty =
minutes and
then back to five. In a group of five or six (if there=E2=80=99s more write=
rs, we split up into two or
more groups), the entire exercise should take an hour. No Praise, No Blame=

philosophy. People write and read what they=E2=80=99ve read or they pass wi=
thout comment
from the group. Contact Trudy for info: Trudetta=40aol.com.

what sad news to hear of this--I only began correspondence with her over
her generous contribution to Midway, and we were honored and excited to
include her piece in our first issue--we will link to the e-book and other
links--

my condolences and prayers and thoughts to her friends here and everywhere,

of particular interest are any textual studies discussing
the work's publication history or variant versions etc (but this is in
no way crucial)

Don't know how popular this has been, but Stanzas in Mediation is another
interesting book in terms of textual variations--generally it's referred to
as an alternate to The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (they were written
at the same time), as if it were a more abstract, poetic version of the sam=
e
text, although it's also seen as a completely disassociated thought
experiment.  The word "may" was edited out between earlier and later
manuscript versions, after Toklas found out about Stein's earlier
relationship with May Bookstaver.

By the way, if you crave getting down into primary sources, the Alice B.
Toklas archives are located in The Bancroft Library on the University of
California campus. I have not personally looked at them, but they are open
to the public and there for the serious dive.

As I recall, Ulla Dydo's original article on the text of Stanzas in
Meditation is a little more detailed than her remarks in her wonderful =
book.
Wendy Steiner's Exact Resemblance to Exact Resemblance (Yale 1978) has =
SOME
discussion of textual differences, but Dydo's work is absolutely =
standard.
It does not, of course cover the whole of Stein's career. Her anthology =
of
Stein -- A GS Reader -- presents texts carefully edited from the MS. If =
you
want to compare those to the usually corrupt published versions (in the =
Yale
multi-volume Stein and elsewhere), go ahead, but it seems pretty =
poiuntless
to duplicate work that's alreadty been done. There are lots of MSS at =
Yale
that have yet to be properly transcribed and edited. I would think
Patriarchal Poetry might be prime candidate for fjurther work here, also
Lifting Belly. There is NO manuscript of Tender Buttons extant -- I =
suspect
Donald Evans of Sweet Marie destroyed it after publishing the book =
(standard
practice then).

of particular interest are any textual studies discussing
the work's publication history or variant versions etc (but this is in
no way crucial)

Don't know how popular this has been, but Stanzas in Mediation is =
another
interesting book in terms of textual variations--generally it's referred =
to
as an alternate to The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (they were =
written
at the same time), as if it were a more abstract, poetic version of the =
same
text, although it's also seen as a completely disassociated thought
experiment.  The word "may" was edited out between earlier and later
manuscript versions, after Toklas found out about Stein's earlier
relationship with May Bookstaver.

be well,
           Bob

Note:  This is an international peaceful call, among the originators are
many Israeli teachers and cultural workers, dissidents and public figures.
It's a call for human rights for all, not against those of anyone or
wouldn't forward this.
As with the boycott of Apartheid South Africa, boycott as protest against
policies and institutions which support them, not against persons, a people,
a nation.
again, wd not fwd this if thought the latter-

Bill Stobb, miPOradio correspondent, recently drove a good distance to interview Brenda Hillman.  Click here and scroll down for part one of the interview & a great photo of her to boot:  http://www.miporadio.net/WILLIAM_E_STOBB/


  FROM BILL:

  Hey y’all,

  Quick note to say I’ve put together a first “Hard to Say” segment from my interview w/ Brenda Hillman.  You’ve got to hear her talk about the composing process—“like a little bee in a meadow, or in Macy’s,” I think she said.  I’ll put together at least one more segment from the interview, so stay tuned for that.  The link to the miPOradio.net page is below.

  Hope you’re all doing well.

  Best,

  Bill

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Back when I was a kid in the mid eighties, I used to love playing those old Infocom text adventure games. You know the ones, where there'd be a paragraph of a story and then the next paragraph of the story would depend on what you typed in at a command prompt.

Anyway, I just found out about this Interactive Fiction (which is apparently what text adventures are called now) programming language called Inform 7 which is in beta now and which is coded in a language that looks a lot like Natural English. I've been playing around with the beta of the software, and it's been a lot of fun. I was curious if anyone on the list had experimented at all with using tools like that to create works of interactive poetry, or if anyone was aware of any good work online that used the Interactive Fiction framework.

Any thoughts? What would a Poetics of Interactive Fiction/Interactive Poetry look like?

One of the things that's occurred to me playing with it is the level of sophistication in the interaction between verbs and nouns is really at the heart of how these things have changed since i spent hours trying to get through the airlock in Rendezvous with Rama. It strikes me that there is a lot of interest there to be harnessed and exploited by a clever poet.

You might look at Nick Montfort's _Twisty Little Paths_
(http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=10509),
which offers the crucial history of IF and the start of a poetics.

This question of the interaction between verbs (but not phrasal verbs, I
guess) and nouns is very interesting. Other linguistic peculiarities of
interest in your experience? Could you give a few examples?

One thing that's also interesting is that at least traditionally the pragma=
tics of verbs has been very strictly limited in Interactive fiction. Becaus=
e the software logic is looking for very specific words to trigger events, =
it's often been the case that the software user might have to rephrase the =
same statement several times until they get precisely the formulation of th=
e sentence that the software needs to move on to the next event.

I remember in particular a game called "cutthroats" that involved scuba div=
ing and smuggling wherein there was a locked door and a rusty key that need=
ed to be cleaned with some steel wool before the key would work in the lock=
=2E There was a very specific sentence that had to be entered in order to c=
lean the key, and i remember a great deal of frustration trying to get it t=
o work. One unique aspect of the experience though was that when I did fina=
lly land on the right sentence, there was a great deal of aesthetic satisfa=
ction that I got from it. So I guess in addition, there's an element of for=
cing the reader, for lack of a better term, to actually create elements of =
the text. in order for the text to proceed. I imagine there's a great deal =
of room for experimentation in the specificity of those elements and using =
them to create interesting and novel phrases.

> What would a Poetics of Interactive
> Fiction/Interactive Poetry look like?

Maybe it depends on the types of interactivity and the arts and media
involved.

In a sense, anything you read is interactive; meaning is constructed.

It's been said that a game is a sequence of interesting choices. Kind of a
general notion of 'game'. But you can see that the notion of 'game' is
related to the type of interactive fiction/poetry you're thinking about.

The type of interactive fiction/poetry you're describing is solely textual.
There is interactive poetry that also introduces other media.

In addition to the notion of 'game', there's the related notion of 'play'.
As in 'play a game' or a guitar or a scenario. Sometimes this activity is
compositional/constructive, sometimes the 'play button' is down, sometimes a
combination of composition and 'playing through'.

Here's some interactive poetry I've made. None of this is like the sort of
interactive fiction/poetry you're describing. Which is to say poetics of
interactive poetry/fiction can be quite broad.

ARTEROIDS
http://vispo.com/arteroids
The battle of poetry against itself and the forces of dullness. A literary
shoot-em-up. Play mode and game mode. Word for Weirdos is in play mode under
'edit'. Game mode scores are uploaded to the Net.

ON LIONEL KEARNS
http://vispo.com/kearns
A binary meditation on the work of a Canadian poet involved in computers and
poetry from the sixties on. A contemporary wreading of his work.

NIO
http://vispo.com/nio
Interactive audio. Synthesis of visual and sound poetry together with
playful interactivity. In two 'verses'. Also involves essays on the poetics
of interactive audio for the Web and audio programming in Director. And
source code. Song shapes. Onion skins.

STIR FRY TEXTS
http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts
An interactive literary form. Ongoing collaborative project since 1999.

ENIGMA N
http://vispo.com/animisms/enigman
Philosophical poetry toy for poets and philosophers from the age of 4 up.

ENIGMA N^2
http://vispo.com/animisms/enigman2
Meaning thrice. Twice forward, once backwards.

MILLENIUM LYRIC
http://vispo.com/animisms/timesuite/MilleniumLyricIntro.htm
A darkening song and then a new day.

SEATTLE DRIFT
http://vispo.com/animisms/SeattleDrift.html
My first poem done in DHTML. While I was living in Seattle.

THE IDEA OF ORDER AT KEY WEST RE-ORDERED
http://vispo.com/vismu/stevens.htm
The autumn of a summer song.

OPPEN DO DOWN
http://vispo.com/vismu/OppenDoDown.htm
Interactive audio.

RUDE LITTLE SONG

Just stepping in here -- a fantastic poetics-smart IF author is Emily
Short (actually a pseudonym.) I see she's updated her website since I last
looked at it --

http://emshort.home.mindspring.com/

The INFOCOM games of many years ago I think jumpstarted the whole genre --
they had a highly sophisticated parser. Amazingly, the thing was
reverse-engineered by a Mathematician at Cambridge, and people can now
write INFOCOM source to compile with freeware applications. Really amazing
stuff really.

There is amazingly quality stuff being written -- Em Short's pages have
links to sites where "ratings" guide you past the dross.

Lily Library in Bloomington had a number Williams's papers. I was working on
another project when I was there (late 80s), but I called out tons of
letters to Floss from his hospitalizations after one of his strokes.

(Two lines that may be of interest: "There was never anyone else. Not
really" and "Even with others I only thought of you. Please believe me."
These were in separate letters professing his love.)

At any rate, you might try access Lily's data base for manuscripts, if any.

Thanks for the thoughts, Jim. I've seen some of your work before, and other ideas using flash by Brian Kim Stefans, and one of my favorites: Alan Bigelow's http://www.savingthealphabet.com/ and I like it a lot. It hasn't appealed much to me as a writer though, mostly because i'm not very visually astute. I tend to think in words not images, and so when i want to make something the visual element is generally the form of a description and not a picture.

Game is one of those hard words to get a head around for me. Wittgenstein uses it as a paradigm case for his dissolution of the problem of universals in Philosophical investigations. I like how slippery a word it is, and I'm quite fond of games like some of the dadaist/surrealist experiments. One thing that's bothered me, however, is that often times it seems like once the game has been played through once or twice, I lose interest.

What I'd like to find a way to is a way to make textual games that are like Chess or Tetris. That is, Games that start from a very simple set of rules and from which can be generated more game playing experiences than an individual could ever hope to achieve in a lifetime. Part of me wants to define "surfing the internet" as that kind of game. I don't know how, precisely, to do it, but I have some ideas. I think part of it has to do with the nature of narrative. That is, it's not really possible to create an open ended narrative. even if you give a large number of options, a story requires a story structure and that's going to create a finite number of possibilities.

ANd now I'm thinking of Borges and the Garden of Forking Paths.

I wonder what he would have done with Flash.

in the late 70s there were plenty of paper books with choices at the bottom
of every page, of the open the door, go to p. 79, walk past, p. 78 sort; my
younger sister read a lot of them

I've got an unpublished poem that springs from the different ways a
nintendo-style game controller is programmed game to game; since the poem
consists of commands, it is my plan to "steer" it through several different
texts, yielding some other poems

viewed formally, like board games, the floorplan (Clue), the maze / road
(Parchesi), the pattern (Go), was replaced by the documentary project
(overlapping letters, diaries, maps, other pseudo "source" materials), the
version (Frankenstein / Patchwork Girl) -- in many ways this has in common
some ideas on organic form except with a different sensibility

I have never been overly drawn to interactive fiction, myself. I'm not sure
why. It might have to do with being more interested in the choices the
author and characters make than in making choices myself, in the story
world. My choices in that situation are typically to continue or not, read
and interpret, reflect. Think of the story in relation to my own life and
those of others. And if continuing, then maybe I'll hunt around the book
looking for interesting parts. I rarely read a book from start to finish.
Only if it is stronly sequential and pleasurably so.

Catherine mentions books from the 70's that were hypertextual but on paper.
I think a prob with a lot of computer hypertexts is they would better be on
paper with an interesting footnote system.

On a computer system, with the way it's typically working with text, image,
motion, sound, and app/code, i dunno, mono media often seems quaint. Like a
movie of scrolling text. Isou, one of my faves, seems to be up to that in
his film on ubu.com. Quaint except in specific contexts such as email. Or,
in a computing situation, where the app is intelligently or otherwise
interestingly generative. Like perhaps in what you're imagining.

I try to make engaging, pleasurable, and significant choices available to
the wreader. My work is intensely engaged with language but isn't dull about
image, sound, and programming. I'm involved with them all as a kind of
writing. I try to put it all together, think compositionally through various
media and arts. Ultimately, I think that's more significant in digital
literature than quaintly avoiding these sorts of issues presented by
computer systems.

Work on YouTube


Some work moved to youtube where it might be easier to watch - I've also
tried for metacafe.com because they pay and we're desperate - they pay if
there are enough viewers - no art category - something about cool stuff -
anyway none of the uploads worked; it would read my .mp4 or .mov files
which went thru easily on youtube. Meanwhile on youtube everything's
blurred out, but at least there in one form or another. And anyway, enjoy.
And tell me what's wrong with metacafe. And send lots of money. Seriously.
Lots and lots of money. - Alan

PS and tell you friends about it and everyone will be happy.

As the chaos intensified in the late 1990s, tribal
factions and then the Taleban attacked a vault in the
grounds of the presidential palace in Kabul, trying to
find the treasure they suspected was inside, but the
inner doors stood firm.

Just a handful of people knew what was there - and
finally, in 2004, the gold was uncovered, hidden in
modest crates under piles of old currency.

Despite persistent rumors to the contrary,
we are fit and healthy, those of us gathering at the monument
to our unknown leader, he whose face was familiar to all
of us who did not know it, who remembered little

if anything about him. Seemingly, our displays
of loyalty have displeased him, though we do not know why
they should. Our spirits are dampened by his contempt
for our abiding love for him...

I see your point, but it's also a question that comes up for me a lot, particularly with visual poetry created digitally like a lot (I won't say all) of your or Ciccariello's pieces, is i'm not sure how to address it as a reader. Some things I look at like i would look at visual art, or the language element is minimized in some other way. for example your "millenium lyric" (which I love, by the way, and can click on for quite some time before i've had enough). But i look at it, and read it, almost like musical notation. The zeros to me have a sort of sound quality to them for me that works with the title "lyric" in a way that short circuits linguistic processing for me and i just here color changing doo-wop.

The thing that appeals to me about IF is 1.) the fact that it's dialogic and 2.) the limitations in the medium that I think you are correct in describing as quaint. those limitations force an author and reader to work strictly within the bounds of not just written verbal language, but a limited subset of that so far as the commands and things go. What complicates things, of course, is making the language sufficiently generative while maintaining narrative to make the whole thing interesting.

Anyway, before i start rambling...
thanks for the insights,
Jason

Censorship, Religion & Sex (update)



Sometimes things get lost in translation before they ever leave the source.



An update and a correction regarding Ekbal Baraka.



While I posted last month that her book had been confiscated by the Egyptian
Mufti, a new email from her makes it clear that this was inaccurate.



The Mufti had been attempting to confiscate and ban the book. As stated in
the earlier post, he had also been trying to forbid her from writing and
publishing in Egypt.



In a letter addressed the Chair of International PEN's Women Writers
Committee and myself, as their Human Rights Commissioner, Baraka gives a
brief update of the situation.



The Minister of Culture appeared on television where he "criticized the
[compulsory use of the] Hijab" on television. This caused a conflict between
the Minister and members of Parliament who have demanded an apology. The
Minister of Culture has held his ground, saying that he had been expressing
his private views- as a citizen- and not speaking as the Minister of
Culture.



This has lead to an active debate among intellectuals. It is unclear from
the email who these "intellectuals"* Baraka mentions are- but this group is
supporting the Minister of Culture's right to freedom of expression and,
furthermore, they are publicly declaring a refusal to force women to wear
the veil on the grounds that there is no basis for compulsory veiling in the
Qur'an.



These proponents of free speech are quoting Baraka's book in these
discussions.



Baraka points out that the female students of Al Azhar have demonstrated
against Baraka, the Minster of Culture and their supporters.



The daily newspaper Al Ahram ** has stopped publishing Baraka's weekly
column.



Baraka was able to obtain a copy of the letter in which the Mufti recommends
confiscating her book, and a lawyer representing the Journalists' Syndicate
is preparing to sue the Mufti and The Council for Religious Researches.



Despite the attempts to silence Baraka- and, of course, due to the attempts
to silence her- her book has sold very well and she has been interviewed by
several television programs and newspapers.



She is hoping the book will be translated into English.



The debate continues.



* Please note that I put the word intellectuals in quotes because I don't
know how else to define the group of people Baraka is referring to. I am
conscious that it could appear that I am contrasting the female university
students from intellectuals. I am not.



** The link is not to the newspaper Baraka writes for. It is to an English
weekly version that I believe is published by the same organization.



Also, please don't comment to enlighten me in regard to the meaning of the
word hajib and it's relationship to the veil. The conflict described above,
and as Baraka describes it, is not about modesty, it is about the compulsory
use of the veil. Baraka uses the term hajib in this debate, and her
opponents are not arguing semantics.

kari edwards- she was the real deal. Phenomenal writer. I'm taking the
liberty of posting something she wrote and which appeared in Tarpaulin
Sky vol. 4 #1... When we last met- back in 04, I think, for lunch here
in the city, and were talking about writing and student loans and how to
live as poets- she said, "Time is running out." She had an urgency to
her. She was always generous in her criticisms of my work and very
sharing about where to send poems, etc. Zero attitude. Wherever she is,
may she continue to write and be kari. God I love this piece. It about
knocked me to the ground:
(piece by)kari edwards

let us say goodbye

let's get serious, say good-bye, I love you, so long, been nice,
someone's got to die, waiting for another on time, A-bomb. Cut off,
collectively lost, as long as you believe in, as long as you think, as
you believe in thinking in believing in . . . click your heels, repeat
after me, we are not talking proxy portraits, or ideological traditional
sophist, or single issue essential, or utopian politicians into an out
of time, falling in and out of the service of "truth," to another, for
another, in love with "truth." Repeating, you have to believe, you must
believe, listen to the mother and father, read books and repeat after
me, I can not represent myself, we must represent the not representative
whole impossible to represent, the higher broader bigger blogger. So,
let's get personal, get serious and translate violence into a form,
wondering are there more morals coming? We all can not wait to read more
of the same long neck gods talking to the pigs, the pigs to the horses,
and the mysterious shadow making mysterious hand motions, waiting to
dine. The tableau is set, you arrive, there is ample bread, plenty of
plenty, translation disappears, there is no need for need, an argument
begins, we all go hungry, start a war of wars, the divine majority sings
creation creation songs in the celestial cathedral till dawn . . . we
say good-bye I love you someone has to die.

Press.  Lewis Warsh's most recent books include The Origin of the World,
Touch of the Whip, Ted's Favorite Skirt and Debtor's Prison (in
collaboration with Julie Harrison). Two new chapbooks, The Flea Market in
Kiel and Flight Test, appeared in 2006. He is co-editor with Anne Waldman o=
f
The Angel Hair Anthology, editor and publisher of United Artists Books, and
Associate Professor in the English Department at Long Island University in
Brooklyn. A new novel, A Place in the Sun, is forthcoming in 2007.  Erica
Kaufman is the co-curator of the belladonna* reading series and small press=
.
She has a few chapbooks and a few more to come and her poems can be found i=
n
places like Jubilat, Puppy Flowers, Bombay Gin and the tiny. She lives in
Brooklyn and loves her puggle.  Dustin Williamson edits Rust Buckle and
co-publishes Currency Press with Andrew Mister. They have put out no books.
Anselm Berrigan is still waiting for Jim Brodey to leave his apartment. Jim
Behrle had the best roommate ever and is the author of She's My Best Friend
(Pressed Wafer, 2006). Joel Lewis just came back from Iceland!

I had come to New York City=A1=AA
wonders in the streets!:
a man whose name was Moondog
stood in midtown building niches
in his Viking get-up=A1=AAleather
clothes, helmet, a cloak, leather straps
and little wooden boxes that hung
at his knees with printed papers
in them that turned out to be his
music. Once I bought a few of them,
ten cents each, but couldn=A1=AFt make
sense of them; threw them away,
though every few years I=A1=AFd find them
and try to figure them out.
Moondog in his Viking helmet,
with horns! Before he died Columbia

and then again he was recorded
in another country where he=A1=AFd moved.
Google =A1=B0Moondog=A1=B1 and find the site. . . .

bios:

*Boog City is a New York City-based small press now in its 16th year and
East Village community newspaper of the same name. It has also published 35
volumes of poetry and various magazines, featuring work by Allen Ginsberg
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, and theme issues on baseball,
women=B9s writing, and Louisville, KY. It  hosts and curates two regular
performance series--d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press, where
each month a non-NYC small press and its writers and a musical act of their
choosing is hosted at Chelsea's ACA Galleries; and Classic Albums Live,
where 4-13 local musical acts perform a classic album live at venues
including The Bowery Poetry Club, CBGB's, and The Knitting Factory. Past
albums have included Elvis Costello, My Aim is True; Nirvana, Nevermind; an=
d
Liz Phair, Exile in Guyville.


*Cuomo!

Brooklyn folk/punk act Cuomo! take the ethics of simple song structure and
upbeat energy of The Ramones or The Clash, then applies the lyrical
sensibilities and songwriting sophistication of Bob Dylan or Simon &
Garfunkel. These combined elements have created a stripped down and earthy
folk aesthetic steeped with a lyrical quality of honest cynicism and lonely
optimism that attempts to bring a refreshingly humble approach to socially
conscious and political songwriting. Songwriter Dave Cuomo is also
co-founder and editor of Urban Folk, NYC's indy folk magazine. After
recently signing with Jersey roots/punk label, Ever Reviled Records, Cuomo!
is preparing for the summer release of their debut album Holiday and
accompanying national tour in the fall.


*Debe Dalton

Debe Dalton stopped writing songs around the time of Hotel California, and
started writing again just about the end of the most recent Eagles=B9 tour.
Coincidence? Possibly.

Debe never stopped performing her banjo-centric old-timey folk & roll; she'=
s
been doing cover songs longer than most of you folk have even heard of
music. But it's what she does, because, as she sings so eloquently in =B3Ed's
Song,=B2 =B3I have to play.=B2


*Nada Gordon

Nada Gordon was born in Oakland, California. She is the author of foriegnn
bodie, Are Not Our Lowing Heifers Sleeker than Night-Swollen Mushrooms?,
Swoon, and V. Imp.  Folly is forthcoming in the spring.

*Sean T. Hanratty

Sean T. is straight outta Brooklyn and on his way into your shower, by way
of you singing his memorably melodic and incredibly enchanting songs in the
shower, of course...

*The Sewing Circle

The Sewing Circle is a musical collective centered around
keyboardist/multi-instrumentalist Preston Spurlock, with frequent
collaborations from his first cousin Chase McGuire. The project started in
West Palm Beach, Florida in the summer of 2003. Since then, they have
recorded two full albums and are currently working on a third, and have had
several live performances. The Sewing Circle specializes in songs about
cryptozoology, extinction, and sleep.

They're actually O's, not 0's. The shape of an O is usually more full-bodied
than a 0 in fonts where the character has body. The O is more plump,
typically, than the 0. More circular on the outside; the inner ellipse is
more gracefully curved, typically, than the inner oval of the 0; the
contrast between the outer and inner ellipses of the O is relatively worthy
of the human significance of O, whereas 0 has been made with a less
attractive hole and overall geometry. O is plump, pregnant, receptive,
sometimes orgasmic; 0 is the void. The O carries more human weight. But the
piece does also play on the possibility they could be zeros, sure.

I wrote the engine for Millenium Lyric before deciding on the text. And then
tried out all sorts of texts. Finally went with the texts of Millenium Lyric
and Timepiece (which has the same engine). The strings are placed in a
circular queue. Mary, to whom the piece is dedicated, is a painter who has a
thing about circles. Timepiece is for another Seattle friend, Joe Keppler,
who has a thing about time. Timepiece actually has several whole words in
it.

You sent a link to a tool for rolling one's own. I don't really want to roll
my own at the mo, but I'd be interested in some links to interesting
interactive fiction by others. Sandy sent one link already.

Well, maybe interactive fiction is early still, like most of the interactive
arts are. i can see interactive fiction being selectively incorporated into
more conventional computer games. John Carmack, one of the main DOOM
programmers, said some time ago "Story in games is like story in pornos.
Everybody expects it, but it isn't very important." Yet I note that one of
the main changes in DOOM 3 is much more narrative matter. So he must have
changed his mind or something.

I went to a conference in Toronto recently on computer games. Jim Bizzocchi
gave a talk. He teaches in Vancouver (grew up in Detroit and went to High
school with Diana Ross). He teaches narrative in games and interactive art.
I repeated Carmack's remark to him. He said it isn't really whether
narrative is important to games, but how it is. That sounds likely to me.
Narrative is operative at some level in most computer games.

But it's also true that the story in most computer games is aimed at kids.
Not exactly Oedipus Rex. Maybe interesting developments in interactive
fiction can help computer games move into something more seriously dramatic.

I've only read one article in the new york review of books on any digital
writing. ever. and it dumped on digital fiction. one point it made, though,
that i recall liking: how we think of story and narrative says a lot about
how we think of ourselves; we understand much of our lives (or not) in
narratives of one sort or another; any interesting changes in how we think
of story are sure to have important consequences in how we think of
ourselves. Maybe that's one of the most interesting possibilities of
interactive fiction.

Jason, and all,

-- there are a couple questions i have about this fascinating discussion --
this seems to be a highly episodic form -- so i would question how
"narrative" it really is, whether it is more like a series of lyrical
moments -- secondly -- if the narrative is that disjointed, can it be called
narrative -- what is meant by "narrative" here -- i would question notions
of plot and closure, whether they really exist in interactive fiction --

-- i think of the exploratory qualities of the form -- but also an
abstraction of the form might be, exploratory

If you NY/NJ area folks haven't made the pilgrimage to Williams' house in
Rutherford, I'd recommend taking that pleasant little trip. The public
library, just across the street also has some Williams artifacts,
including his desk, which are being prepared for display.

There are several good looking restaurants right on the main drag by his
house.  We went for "Risotto" and it was excellent.  More details on the
blog on  www.myspace.com/avantretro

Sorry to clutter the listserv, but I don't want any of you to be misled.
Williams' house at 9 Ridge Road is not an "Historic House"...that is, it's
not open to the public...some normal citizens (another doctor) live there.
 So if you go, realize you merely get to walk around it and think about
the poems that were written there without going inside to look around.

have been mulling over jason's comments about interactive fiction. he said
something about our experience of the internet being a bit like one big
interactive fiction. it's an interesting observation.

for instance, we tend to use google and other searches quite a bit. this is
actually fairly close to what you do with interactive fiction. in
interactive fiction, you type 'commands' that do whatever. google is sort of
'command line'. i guess the command line would actually be the address bar;
the search box is a simplification of the parameters you see in the address
bar when you do a google search.

part of the strength of google as an 'interactive fiction' is that its
'world view' indexes so many other world views--so many other works. google
just presents a good way to navigate through the world of net documents (and
videos yadayada). its world view is mostly upon the architecture of net
information; it leaves the more humanly significant world views to the
surfer--though, of course, google has its ommissions and emphases as well.

so, um, interactive fiction has some fascinating 'competition'. aye not so
much 'competition' as maybe a partner in crime if interesting ways to use
such things in interactive fiction could be devised.

LEE WORDEN'S CUTUP ENGINE 2.0
http://vispo.com/cgi-bin/wonder/cutup/cutup.cgi

Some will recall the Cutup Engine Lee Worden had up on the Net for several
years. You cut and paste text into it or feed it one or more URLs, and it
dices the text nice. William S. Burroughs said that when you cut audio tape,
the future leaks out. The Cutup Engine provides an unexpected view through
the interzones of texts. Data structures, however dimensional, are
expressable as strings.

It's great to have this wordenful, creative tool back on the Net after an
absence of a couple of years. Lee Worden has re-written it and added a few
features.

You can adjust the "chunk size". The cutup code splits the source texts into
words (html tags are treated as one word). It constructs the cutup text, by
default, by pulling chunks of 3 to 7 words from the source texts and adding
on chunks until the total, by default, is at least 1,000 words.

The total length of the cutup is adjustable from 1,000 to 10,000 words.

Cutups are stored on the server for 30 days. They aren't moved to the public
archive unless you visit the piece at least a day later. In that case,
they're scheduled for being moved to the permanent archive, which is
browsable. Copy the URLs of cutups you want to submit to the permanent
archive and visit them a day later. That'll do it.

Lee has also implented an interesting feature that makes the Cutup Engine
part of your browser. You bookmark the link described at
http://vispo.com/wonder/cutup/about.htm . From then on, you can click the
bookmark to cut up whatever page your browser is currently displaying.

You can also check out the Perl source code.

Lee Worden is a mathematician who investigates systems. More about Lee at
http://two.ucdavis.edu/~worden/pub/cv.pdf .

ja

ps: He has also written something about cutups that is part of a stir fry
piece at http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts/4.html

Hi
After umpteen decades of utter dominance by America in English-language
poetry, I wonder how necessary it is to have a magazine only six years old
(a Journal of Contemporary American Poetry) whose title seems to exclude
non-American contributions. As if America was some poor post-colonial
outpost that needed to protect itself from cultural imperialism with an
artistic trade barrier.As if that wasn't the reverse of the truth. Anyway,
as a Welsh victim/beneficiary of American AND English cultural imperialism
(or something; theories vary), I'd like to know if you'd consider a poem or
two from myself. I mean, there are other outlets, obviously, but I just
fancied yours.The respected North Wales mag that published me recently has
contributions from the States. The Welsh publisher of my first collection
( Pieces, from Cinnamon Press, copies from cinnamonpress.com) publishes
American poetry.I'm probably reading far too much into the title. Small
nation paranoia. Let me know what you think. In the meantime, remember what
the postmodernist guru Diana Ross advised: reach out and touch somebody's
hand.
Peace and love
John Tanner

Ian,
    I am following rule number 1: replying to your email.

    Printed in the body of my email reply are four poems.

    My address is Mary Kasimor  104 18th Ave. N., St. Cloud, MN  56303.

    A bio.
    I have been published in many online and print journals, including Gutcult, Volt, Coconut, Lungfull!, Big Bridge, BlazeVOLT2k3, moria, among others.

    Best,
    Mary Kasimor

                                              Mary  Kasimor
                                              104 18th Ave. N.
                                              St. Cloud, MN  56303


      I thought it was desire
  you spread out hundreds
  of miles away
  what I thought you became
            more than the distance
  thinking you into existence
  was unnecessary
  it was right here
  I could live as a 15th century
  nun                    love caught in
  threads     the tapestry
  hangs and I am the handmaiden
  of its art
                           sorrow and tears make
  it salt
  I hold the ocean in my brain
  and it is bigger than all this

  8 am  returns me to the mundane
  water of tea      and swimming
  with it     the world is pleasant
            enough

  a store bought cake
  is not manna     nor
  perfect bread        I serve it
  and acknowledge that its taste
  is an aspiration of slaves
               wanting art to be intangible


      like searching for love
  in the middle of the garden
  and finding that at its heart
  are thorns


                                             Mary Kasimor

      picking Up the object
                                      what it is Is an  object
      feeling its way across      the  mountains
      at the end it is      more than it seems seam-
      Lessly connecting from two  beginnings a related
      definition means that
                                              I am the  Honey
      from the bee       perhaps I am Also the honey
      and the bear
                              I will change the  Past   it appears
      before your eyes as a seashell
                                                     somewhere it
      floats   in salty water the tears at the End
      are misspoken because They  Speak      as sorrow
      another quizzical summary of winter  and
      summer          Vegetables re-ignite fire
                                   you plant strange  beings in
      the mountains    repetition dares to differ
      in Breeding
                         brooding Over its  differences

      on common ground
      a plastic mansion grows
      over schools      (of)
      thought that frame
      questions in mirrors
                                or through
      doors     keeping it inside
                          I want to leave the road
      next to the sign (points) to
      more trees and then
      a power plant that shows
      redundancy as a fine invention
      of frances bacon             who lies down next
      to aristotle         and the stream of birds
                              flying east show the  different
      rivers above them
                        (as) extensions of other life
      forms          it is colorless
      an eagle on the flat roof
      of an ugly building (lives)
                                      despite all the  disruption
      in plastic factories we make
      matches to (match) your prices
      gorging on synthetic food
                         the taste of revolution
      (is) the diamond
                                       apple on the  tree
      in the factory       time divides
      us into practical machines
      I listen through my cell phone

      it is hell in here

      in this narrative it is
      nature
                                it is the ruby ring
      on the hand that draws the bow
      on the violin
      on the bow that needs the arrow
      in this schema     a + b
                        equals one or the other
      I know more about an unidentified
      place on this earth
      but there is no voice to hold it in  the center
                                            and off to  the side
      contains the button that changes
      the middle of there to the middle
                        of then

                                    in this huge  building you
      become lost and it confounds
      the philosophers because they are  men
      the women gather in the kitchen
      baking bread
                          light filters tea
      all this must mean more but it
      does not
      I will try to explain it on
      paper         in this life I have
      three hands
                               the hands are poetry
      no one knew this
      but I cultivate them
      like circles and seeds
      that return
                           if they chose to be
      wild seeds    the jazz in the rivers
      would ignite all the highways
                           how to get out of the fire
      is found in a translation of  indigenous
      language     the lions succeeded in leaping
      out     the river is more blood
                                         passion finds another
      poem in your other hands

Dear Ian,

Trying this again b/c the listserv rejected my previous e-mail; I apologize
if this is a re-post.

Thank you for your call for submissions; please see below for bio, address,
and 2 commensurate poems from a manuscript entitled, Ombudsmen of the Imp. =
 I
admire 88 and I'm grateful for your consideration.

Thanks,
David Alworth

Quid

Be a bit surly with your renegade physiognomy: peripatetic pr=E9cis, slothf=
ul
anodyne, timbre recovered as oracular atavism pink with amniotic lapidary.
The simian dur=E9e of declivity. Something dyspeptic for the attentive
contessa to germinate treillage quietude=97and all this bric-a-brac inscrib=
ed
in anagram. Willy-nilly as convalescence, as function, as colonnade muster.
If the ombudsman said surgical dehiscence were apodictic, the so-called as
is, there might be a kind of kooky flanker worth pursuing, but ascetics mak=
e
pixilation a matter of bric-a-brac, of lability. Lurch by stereoscopic
millenarians, give sentience a chance, try to pass muster. Perhaps
too-churlish quietude, an atopia redescribed as culpability, as slipshod
first-responder, while suasive stenographers try their luck at laconic
xenology. Some slovenly ombudsman missing ambulatory geomancy=97no way to
adjudicate, no substrate, no nooks for heuristic granularity. But to resolv=
e
orthographic atavism willy-nilly with bric-a-brac, with fluxion as
viability, splenetic as the guffaw anecdote, a new impresario, some sentien=
t
stereoscopy, some physiognomic glean, some matter bins.


Dervish

Tender bric-a-brac wills two-dot matrices for splenetic mambo. And bidding
wars for anomic lacunae. And humble churls blat rasp to indemnity or
amniotic mensuration. So thumb the underbelly of the stochasticity and quip
ineluctable adisposition to the funny bone: nonce prop, sinuosity and lumba=
r
menace=97bulge blunt as it degenerates, the body, the body. As is always th=
e
simian modality. Remove inscription from sylvan femurs, subjectile in
earnest the oracular conscript to plutocracy where contrapuntal archontics.
Sing brass, a kooky obscurantist unhinged. Or rather heuristics transposed
to the hypomnesic pitter-patter: two milkweed millenarians and a few
redolent auteurs leaning and loafing on oneiric regicide. And the work get
done=97and quickly. But to hypostasize the distich, to preponder binocular
parallax, is to unmake a fledgling leanto, says the otherwise laconic
mandala. What would be, finally, the exogenous paragone of servile flanerie=
?
Too many dour apodictics like assertorial orthography, the graphologic
muumuu is our new sobriquet, and anyway the quibble, the dur=E9e, the
ineluctable ludditism of primeval physiognomy.

LETTER FROM FANNY BURNEY TO HER SISTER ESTHER

1 October, 1811

Dear Sister,


             So here I am alone.
The surgery is over and the stitches

removed, but my fingers, of their own accord,

stray to what used to be my breast.

Yesterday, I found my way to the looking glass

and forced myself to see the thing of which my pen

refuses almost to write.  I am flat sister, flatter

than the Salisbury Plain, and a snake slithers

along it. I fear the cancer adder will strike again,

and in the night I wake screaming just as I did

when the surgeon=92s knife scraped my breast bone.

I could hear the scraaaaaatch, scraaaaaatch,

scraaaaaatch intermingled with my screams.

Only sounds sister, like animals make,

suffice to tell you how it is when your body

betrays you like a lover running off with a courtesan,

only worse, for I am a woman no more,

her beauty cut away.  I could bear

the dreadful steel plunging into the breast,

endure as it cut through veins, arteries, flesh, nerves,

for I would sometimes pass out from the pain.

Childbirth, phew! That was nothing

in comparison--then, or now

when I again sent Mr. D=92Arblay away.

Last night, I told him: =93Husband, just go.

Do you see that bright moon in its fullness?

It no longer speaks of love.

Oh, he tried to console me,

told me this is not the bitterest woe.

But I saw his looks. They were shocking.

Do you know the surgeons never told me

they would remove the entire breast?

I read it in the language of their hands,

and I must tell you dear sister, for there is nothing

a woman cannot do, I reached out with my own

and steadied the breast for them to do their work.

=93Ah Messieurs!=94 I cried. =93Que je vous plains!=94



                                     Love,

                                                 Fanny

Kuki Gallmann On The Death of Her Son.

I did not know what to do with my hands
as my slack mouth tried to force breath,
my breath, its seventeen years of loving
whoosh whoosh into my son, my Emanuele.
It was not that I hadn=92t bargained with God,
promised all I had in exchange
for this one life of my life,
the terrible brevity of it.
Yet this day dawned like any other. 12 April, 1983.
A cup of tea. Simon, the houseboy, smiling
Jambo, Memsaab, and the dogs, their cold noses,
wet tongues caressing my face,
and this broad-shouldered man
standing before me, snake-tongs hanging
from his belt: Can I have a rubber band?

I detested that band but could not stop him
or my lips from uttering: I hate you doing that.
I put the teacup on its saucer
and never took another sip.

You always worry.  I have done it dozens of times.

I could see his elegant fingers
tighten a piece of plastic
around the neck of a sterilized jar,
see him push the glass against the fangs
of a puff-adder, see the gland pulse.
the venom spurt not unlike
the atomizer of my perfume.

I am going to milk the snakes.

Yes, off he went in the lean light of morning.
His eyes smoldered amber; the shadow
of the house threatened the lawn,
Yes, he walked away, this a young man
grown full of himself, full of passion,
dream, and this action he would not live
to regret.  My stomach lurched.
A fist hammered into it. Can there be
such a thing as premonition?

He walked out of the snake pit
Holding his bitten hand, the short nails
turned white, his mouth dribbling green saliva
He made it home to the kitchen and fell blind
Saying Mamma, his voice lost, thin,
unlike his own.

My vision blackened.  Wapi yeye? I cried:
Where has he gone? And God
declined to answer as I sat
cradling my boy=92s dead face,
tracing my finger along the shadow
of a moustache on his upper lip,
touching the mole on his cheek;
strange I=92d not noticed it before.
I pushed a wisp of black hair
from his forehead and placed
a kiss on each eyelid
marking it for sleep.

In red Alabama clay, a woman

             digs seed syllables, takes

             them,   rich bija, in her hand,

             takes them to her mouth

             and waits.  If they grow

             as they should, watered

             with saliva, with tears,

             with hope. time will be writ

             in texts, like meaning scribed

             on red-bellied turtle backs.

My name is:
 Mitchell Eismont

Bio:
Mitchell Eismont has won several awards including, "Outstanding Young Poet" by McGregor Anthologies. His first book untitled Shots was published last summer. Mitchell is also a visual poet and graphic designer working on his MFA.

 Now here are my poems for submission thanks,
 Poem 1:

 They call it the Idol

 He hits pipe at night
 orange glow
 over face
 hidden in closet
 like habit
 forms formulizations
 equations of money
 and how he gets
 next fix
 says a prayer
 folds fingers
 around rock
 cradles it
 like baby Jesus
 or a trinket
 from a dead
 loved
 one

 he repents while high – hooked he goes back – and hooked he goes back – repeats in endless cycle -

 Poem 2

 NYC 2006

 taxi man isn’t for death  sentence
 as politician on street says,
 “lets get those Nazis out
 of office, boys.”

 I try to acclimate myself
 to the surroundings
 of tall buildings
 as lil ole six foot five me
 raised in a town of ten
 thousands cram into subways
 and suffocate next to each other.

 Its just them small things.

 Receptionist tells me, “gonna
 hang you by your
 feet next time.”
 (if I take my key out of hotel again.)

 the smell of street vendors
 and trash on sidewalk
 cigarettes smoked outside
 in sadness.
 Sun don’t rise over buildings
 just straight down streets.

 Musicians play for change.

 Young artists sling CDs
 to passerby on street.

 Mental ill lay on sidewalks
 and singsongs
 from Harry Potter

 and the night never sleeps
 just hangs low in the clouds
 like a moon made out
 of neon lights





 Thank you again
 Mitchell  Eismont

Philip Nikolayev's latest volume of poems, Letters from Aldenderry, is fr=

"Nikolayev's new collection is magnificent... He has a mobile, philosophi=

    ---James Wood

"In Letters from Aldenderry the reader experiences repeated shocks of rec=
ognition, accompanied by the pleasure of recalling that, yes, that's how =
it is! How did this poet know it feels that way? This is a truly exciting=
 collection of lyrics, as surprising and varied as it is original."

Dear Mr. Wilson,
I'll submit a few things for 88. I've been published
in can we have our ball back?, RealPoetik and a
variety of French journals, and you can find out more
about me on my blog. The third poem submitted has
already appeared on that blog, and the others are
unpublished anywhere.
Here's a bio for the contrib notes, as per
instructions:
You may find out more about Alexander Dickow on his
blog, www.alexdickow.net/blog.
And address:
Alexander Dickow

Poems are pasted below, separated by ***.
Thanks for offering us the opportunity.
Cordially,
Alexander Dickow

I have glimpses everywhere for it.
I will scouring any single one
by one of that belongings from me,
I will be break all of rules
to be finding it back.
Besides myself to worry,
because if I would lost it,
I have none of moreover.
Following for clues, is notice
some kind resemblance...
Had you to seen it anywhere,
you are telling to me? Once
day I would maybe to wake
thoroughly up myself,
I’ll found it here was whole

The issue, problems explain,
entail convince, question
and considerable related.
Involve, however, responds
that problems neglect, error,
and other concerns debate.
Results suggest, for instance,
suppose answers that define
plausible, agree, conviction;
in short, possible? Opinions,
the issue concludes: examples
indicate otherwise, despite
evidence to the contrary.

While I, for one, certainly don't mind reading people's submissions to
88, I think what Mr. Wilson intended was for you to reply to his post
and *change the "To:" address from the Poetics list to his email
address*.

"Katie Cruel"
for C--

I am now just a smolder where the sun sets
the western shore alight. We were what could
call from a distance on moors at a distance. There
and with dogs we ran her down with dogs
and ropes & cutting things sharpened against
the asphalt in the rain. And ran in the shadows
all night in the distance where seven men cut
silhouettes of flapping long coats like rook wings
in queue against the western sky as we moved.
Their canes & bodies long & standing upright
they upright & carry forward. And now just
as it has been where I have been, there now
will the cut off if carry forward the sharp sounds
of Katie's cries. Carved from the oak in long strips
more strips as well of cascara bark where rain
fell. Like Lot's wife wrapped in sodium and water.
The fires of chemical burns now in Sheol the shoals
of the rovers of green where wild irises have been
left to twine and gambol. I am now just a wisp of smoke
set for the sun as it drifts away with the summer now.
And we will ride on plastic wings aloft in the updraft
of the firelight & westward the course of Empire
shall we follow fallow in the updraft now & on & out
beyond the edge of the world where the sea drops away.



"Household Activity No. 72"

Up close
the cat's nose
looks like a vagina.

Behind the refrigerator
where the lost forks are

Everywhere I look
the holes in walls
leak pink lagging like look

like. I am adrift and
sleepy in the sharp toothed
vagina of the world.

You put shoes, Buffy, Rottweilers, and Prufrock above Tender Buttons?

  "No particular order" isn't a qualifier that makes me overlook the numbers descending in a list.  I'm too conventional.  And serious.

herself into a doe?,

Dissecting an Orchid


We met at theaters. Between reel-changes we snuck behind concession
stands, spoke of Buddhism. He hated the Dalai Lama. "I'd never
venerate that guy," he said. "Not by my own will." Not by our own
wills, Tibetan monks fleeing=97robes scripture-lined=97into Kalimpong, or
his palms breaking the straight, clamped line of my thighs. But I
named him Molasses-under-the-Eyes (all of them) as easy as I named him
Teacher-of-the-Oceans (all of them). He's an orchid now, tucked
between three wool folds and cardamom. Skins rhizome, lamina=97membrane
pulled taut, snapped like cold-washed beans. Grown wild. "There are
ghosts," I tell him. My hands cup butane. Spark. Light cigarettes on
Jelepla Pass. He trembles, sheds his waxy sheen. Veins parallel. We
might be even.

Someone thought, backchannel, I might have misunderstood Jason's poem.  Perhaps my own wit is too dry.  Of course, if one explains a joke, well, it ain't funny.  When I labelled myself 'conventional' and 'serious' i thought these were clues ...
  It's pretty clear Jason's not following any usual ordering priority when a top ten list contains a hundred plus items.

  People sure are posting a lot of poem submissions to Poetics today.

  One of the best dogs I ever knew was a rottweiler.


  Apropos, an excerpt from TENDER BUTTONS:


  A CHAIR.

A widow in a wise veil and more garments shows that shadows are even. It addresses no more, it shadows the stage and learning. A regular arrangement, the severest and the most preserved is that which has the arrangement not more than always authorised.

A suitable establishment, well housed, practical, patient and staring, a suitable bedding, very suitable and not more particularly than complaining, anything suitable is so necessary.

A fact is that when the direction is just like that, no more, longer, sudden and at the same time not any sofa, the main action is that without a blaming there is no custody.

Practice measurement, practice the sign that means that really means a necessary betrayal, in showing that there is wearing.

Hope, what is a spectacle, a spectacle is the resemblance between the circular side place and nothing else, nothing else.

To choose it is ended, it is actual and more than that it has it certainly has the same treat, and a seat all that is practiced and more easily much more easily ordinarily.

Pick a barn, a whole barn, and bend more slender accents than have ever been necessary, shine in the darkness necessarily.

Actually not aching, actually not aching, a stubborn bloom is so artificial and even more than that, it is a spectacle, it is a binding accident, it is animosity and accentuation.

If the chance to dirty diminishing is necessary, if it is why is there no complexion, why is there no rubbing, why is there no special protection.

"No particular order" isn't a qualifier that makes me overlook the numbers descending in a list. I'm too conventional. And serious.

I am considering applying for the creative writing phd programs (in the event that Ido not get a job this year...) at the Universities of Manchester and Newcastle in England, but know very little about these programs' aesthetic leanings. I like that Newcastle encourages the hybridization of the critical and creative aspects of the dissertation, as this is what I want to do. Does anyone by chance know what these programs are like?  I'm looking at Denver in the states, the only phd with an emphasis in creative writing that I know with an experimental bias. The prospect of spending a few years in Europe is very enticing, though...

Thanks,
Tod

Guys,

My som just sent me information about an Iranian photographer who had taken
pictures of Kurds being executed by the Khomeini governmenti= in the
seventies. One of them won the Pulitzer Prize anonymously at the time. Had
any one heard of these photos?

They are absolutely amazing. Here is the website where you can find the
photos, including an article WThe Wall Street Journal published at the time:
http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB116499510215538266-w6oLtTyb6LO2glORvqxTV1PwiTM_20061211.html?mod=blogs

Of course, there are eerie echoes of the photographs from Abu Grab, also,
another instance showing the eerie power of photography.

Unfortunately, violence is endemic and does not belong to one party. One
should not have any illusions.

Ciao,

Murat

Apologies for not being more clear that the replies should have been to me
and not the list.  Those who did reply to the list, I have copied out your
posts and will consider them.

Apologies to the person from Wales who wants the journal to be something
other than it is.  There are about 1900 other journals listed in the Poets
Market guide.  Perhaps one of those might better suit you.

The Edge

Go to the edge of the world. Don't come back until you find it. Don't tell
me there's no edge. If you think there's no edge you're not at the edge of
the world. Are you. When you reach the edge of the world you have only one
way to go. You may think you have another way to do but you only have one
way to go and that is away from the edge of the world. You may go to the
edge and you may look over the edge. You may see the shell of the world or
the beams of the world. You may see the nodes of the world and the vectors
of the world. You cannot go beyond the edge of the world. You may think
the edge of the world is quiet and smooth. It is not. The edge of the
world repulses the world. The edge of the world repulses the world trying
to go beyond the edge of the world. The world cannot go beyond the edge of
the world. If you cannot go beyond the world at the edge of the world
you're at the edge of the world. You may dance at the edge of the world
and you may look. You may look just a little beyond the edge of the world.
You may look at the sky. The sky is part of the edge of the world. If you
look at the sky and you cannot touch the sky you are at the edge of the
world.

The edge of the world is not a barrier and not a frontier. There are no
guards at the edge of the worlds. There are no tariffs and no customs.
There is nothing at the edge of the world but the edge of the world. The
edge of the world is nothing and separates you from nothing. You may think
to yourself someone owns the rest of the world. Or someone owns the edge
of the world. Someone may own up to the edge of the world. Someone may own
the edge of the edge of the world. No one can own the edge of the edge
beyond the edge of the world. The edge of the edge beyond the edge of the
world is an open set. The world up to the edge of the world includes the
edge of the world. The edge of the world is a closed set. You may think
you are free but you are in a closed set. You may dance within the closed
set and you will be thrown back at the edge of the world. For the edge of
the world is an active edge and a prohibition. The prohibition at the edge
of the world is within the world.

Every dance is a dance at the edge of the world. Every dance weakens the
world. The world is weaker for dance. Dance is stronger for the world.

You may think you are at the edge of the world. Then return from the edge
of the world. You may think there's no edge of the world. Then you're not
at the edge of the world.

VISPO.COM GUEST WORK AND COLLABORATORS
http://vispo.com/guests

I've been publishing vispo.com since 1995; there's a great deal of work on
the site. Most of it--by 'volume'--is my own work: vispo.com is the primary
way I publish my work--but over the years the site has come to house a
significant body of work by other people and also collaborative work between
myself and others. I've collected and annotated a page of links to that
onsite work at http://vispo.com/guests .

The most recent works on this page are from 2006, and the oldest is from
1988. Soon to be 1984, actually: I'm working with Geof Huth, Dan Waber,
Marko Niemi and Lionel Kearns to recover the animated computer poetry
bpNichol did in 1984, and we will eventually get that up on vispo.com.
Anyway, http://vispo.com/guests links close to twenty years of work. I have
a sense now of working both forward and backward in time. Still trying to
forge ahead with new and, hopefully, innovative, fresh projects, but also
doing projects such as the bpNichol project and 'On Lionel Kearns' that look
back and either recover work relevant to digital poetry now or present the
work of artists who have been a big influence on me.

Most of the pieces are explorative of digital writing. The 2006 works are by
Lee Worden and Marko J. Niemi, both of whom are programmers as well as
writers. Lee, who has a doctorate in math from Princeton, has re-written his
Cutup Engine that some of you will be familiar with. This is an excellent
tool for exploring the interzones of texts. You paste text or URLs into the
Engine and it dices them in a configurable way. Marko's 2006 works are the
Concrete Stir Fry Poems. These deal with cutups also, but in a lettristic,
visual poetic manner. Marko is a remarkable poet-programmer from Finland;
his work bodes well for the future of digital poetry.

Also, the page links to the work of the Argentine poet Ana Maria Uribe, who
passed away in 2004 and whose Typoems and Anipoems are, in their entirety,
housed on vispo.com. She also collaborated in the production of Paris
Connection, a project in critical media that examines the work of six French
net artists. There are other projects in critical media such as Defib, a
series of sixteen chat interviews produced with Dan Waber; in 1999-2000 we
produced chats with writers who were attempting to produce work on the Web.
The page links also to Strings by Dan Waber, which is a project in kinetic
poetry that has been wonderfully successful; Strings is taught in many
Universities that deal with digital poetry.

The oldest links on the page are from my pre-Web days as a writer and audio
producer. There's a radio show I produced on the poetry of Seattle's Joseph
Keppler (there are over 100 other shows in the vault, not online). And the
page links to some of the music of The Laughing Boot Quintet, in which I was
the drummer and audio engineer. There's also a link to a Paul McKinnon
recording done at Mocambopo, a reading series I organized and hosted in
Victoria Canada in the nineties (Mocambopo kept going like the Energizer
Bunny for years after I left and only recently moved venues).

And there are links to other work such as collaborations with Brian Lennon
and Pauline Masurel concerning stir fry texts; a link to my page featuring
some of Ted Warnell's work; a link to Jorge Luiz Antonio's page that he
maintains on vispo.com on Brazilian Digital Poetry on the Web; a link to
Shuen-shing Lee's translations into Chinese of some of my work; and a link
to work by Uruguay's Clemente Padin.

There's also a link to PRIME, the Peace Research Institute in the Middle
East, which I maintain on vispo.com with my friend Sid Tafler. PRIME is
headed by Sami Adwan, a Palestinian, and Dan Bar-On, an Israeli. Together,
they work on some fascinating and incredibly worthwhile projects in
peace-building between Palestinians and Israelis. Sid edits the site and I
do the HTML.

Anyway, all this work by others and in collaboration with others has been a
true joy in my life. The page is ongoing, as mentioned--it isn't finished
yet--nor am I, I hope. But I wanted to acknowledge this work and thank those
who have contributed fine work to vispo.com and collaborated with me on
other work. You discover alternative approaches to poetry in just about all
this work, that attempt some synthesis of arts, media, and fields such as
programming and mathematics or music and recorded sound. As well as attempts
to write of the poetics of such practice. It's about putting it all
together, connecting,  staying human, discovering the nature of our altered
humanity and language so that we can address life with fresh insight and
communicative power.

Vispo.com is an attempt to create a literary work alternative but related to
the book; to create works and experience imaginatively attuned to the media
and methods of the Net. Being truly literate involves not only reading but
writing; vispo.com is an attempt to write through new media. It is my life's
work; and the work on vispo.com by others and in collaboration with others
is a huge part of the nature of that life and work to put it all together,
to make strong connections. The French poet Isou said "Each poet will
integrate everything into everything." And this was way before the Net. Same
job, different time and circumstances.

Dan,
Reread Wilson's submission guidelines: he's very
insistent, "REPLIES ONLY" will be considered. Since
I'm in digest format, that leaves me not much choice,
I'm afraid. Just playing it safe: my apologies for

Here's a thought. Let's say that syntax is gendered. Women are
usually the primary vectors of language--they talk to their babies
more than men do. A truly revolutionary act would be for women to
avoid using syntactic speech within hearing of their babies. Unless
Chomsky is right this should produce ungendered language. Or maybe no language.

On terms with gender bias, like hysteria. Language has history, and
the meanings of words migrate, as hysteria has, and also virtue,
which once meant manliness but hasn't in a long time. None of this
would be an issue if better than half the population didn't feel
aggrieved about how they're treated. Change the social parameters and
no one would care about the language issues. Except for the use of
ms., for which I'm eternally grateful, this seems to have happened
already for many women on the corporate track.The question is whether
changing the language would have any impact on the social parameters.
If we all called ourselves citoyen or tovarisch would there be true equality.

Mark

Mark, hmm.  But changing social parameters takes time, of course, and
happens only incrementally, as a rule... The world may be altered --
for better, or for worse -- b/c of poetry, or art, or sentences, but
those alterations are generally not a matter of direct causal
explanations of the sort at stake in stepping on the scale after a
holiday.  That is, we simply can't quantify them in such terms...

Here's a thought, one that's been oft observed in discussions of
gendered language practices:  if we were to make it a habit of saying
"John raped Susan" instead of "Susan was raped," it would be that
much more likely that Susan wouldn't be accused of having brought
said rape upon herself.

That's a matter of standard (active vs. passive) syntax either way,
so it doesn't answer directly to the idea of changing SVO relations
(say) as a means of addressing social inequities.  But it does
suggest that how we shape our sentences has ultimately something to
do with those social parameters you mention, yes?

Best,

Joe

for more on the ways in which english is a gendered language, see
Julia Penelope, _Speaking Freely: Unlearning the Lies of the Father's
Tongue_. she was one of the first to offer as a quick and lovely
example the problem with the rhetoric we use to articulate a rape
event.

see also deborah tannen, just about any title (_You Just Don't
Understand_ is for lay folk; _Language and Sexuality_ also
interesting); but my other fav is jennifer coates----_Women, Men and
Language_ is in a 3rd edition now i think.

the original bases for all of this tho were works by robin lakoff, in
the "seminal" (hm) text _Language and Women's Place_, which came out
in 1975 and has been reissued on that anniversay with a new intro by
her and with essays critical in the back. the text itself is fairly
short and a fun read if you're into this shit.

what she asserts there over and over (my reason for the above biblio)
is that linguistic change must follow social change---it can't cause
it. i disagree with her but am unable to offer anything a linguist
would accept---i can offer only empirical evidence from the last 40
years---mark's citing of "Ms." is a good example. i swear, i remember
just where i was when i heard that the New York Times had decided
after all to use it, and that decision made Ms. de rigeur. and Ms.
has survived even as we've suffered through a major and extended
period of backlash.

as with most such debates, tho, the middle ground is probably the
closest to "correct" that we can come---it's likely that the
linguistic shifts and the social shifts are symbiotic, that language
follows but also offers possibilities (imaginings) to the social.

and yeah, long long long long time. second-wave feminism was one of
the fastest, most successful social movements in history (there are
socio-economic situations that were responsible for a good bit of
that), but now here we sit, with sarah still the subject, not object,
of her rape. we'll be sitting for a while, if history is any judge.

kass

I find myself wanting to distinguish limitations from quaintness.  All
media have technical limitations--William Morris' "resistance in the
materials"--and the move from one medium to another, and thus from one
set of limitations to another, often sparks creativity in the way you
describe.  (This works in reverse too--coming back to print poetry looks
different after working in digital media--but that's maybe a subject for
another posting if I don't fade back into lurkerdom.)

But quaintness is not technical; it is not even material.  It is,
rather, social, in the same way that fashion, though it is "about"
material objects like clothes, is social.  Quaintness is not a property
of the object but an attitude of the viewer, overdetermined by
constantly shifting social norms.

So here's what I'm wondering.  In sparking your creativity against the
technical limitations of the medium, are you also working against/out of
the social attitudes now attached to the medium?  Is quaintness as a
social phenomenon part of the materials' resistance?  (And are books
quaint, while we're at it?)

there are theorist feminists who have suggested, using very complex
sentences, that women revert to baby talk to free themselves in just that
way--not too practical in this world but I get the point.

lang and politics and social parameters are intertwined. there is progress
of course in some ways but even the UN says women are the group
discriminated against in every country of the world--most people starving
are women & children of color, to give one ex.
      as gloria steinem says, as long as we eroticize violence there will be
sexual slavery--and rape and on and on--the visual & verbal langs we learn
make us 'buy' into those things--as does the normalization of porn by the
major networks & others

look at one TV comedy and analyze it from a gender perspective--who is 'good
looking,' what do men expect in relationships, who is wearing what, who says
what, what happens, who the star is, what the ages and looks of the men and
women are, what is advertised, who wears make-up (red lips, blackened eyes,
red cheeks show women in
a state of sexual 'readiness'--it all matters--our culture commodifies women
most of all--look at the billions spent on make-up, look at the mags in CVS,
listen to jokes abt sex--sex is wonderful when it isn't sexist but in a
culture in which girls in 3rd grade hate their bodies, lang and visual lang
affect us--how cd they not?

Interesting sentences. The second presupposes: 1. that the identity
of the rapist is known. 2. that th4e focus of attention is on who
acted rather than the impact on the victim. Unless one means to imply
that "Susan's current emotional state is the product of her having
been raped by John, whereas if Saul had done it..." Which is to say,
that the two sentences serve different functions. If we got in the
habit of using the second sentence we'd be shifting attention away
from Susan in ways that might not always be useful. In any case,
among civilized people (and I take myself as a standard here) neither
sentence would imply that Susan was the agent of her rape nor excuse
John (and changing standard syntax would be quite neutral). One can
of course imagine places where they might. Context is
everything--change the context and the freight of the sentences changes..

In Navajo, if I remember correctly, a higher lifeform is never
passive to a lower life form. So, Susan tripped over the rock, but
Susan never was tripped by the rock. Susan got herself kicked by the
horse, but the horse didn't kick Susan. I have no idea what Navajo
does about rape.

I teach research writing, and the final paper is a argument/persuasion  paper. This seems to be the common style of the freshman writing class.  I do have issues with the thesis--the hard hitting, linear way of  constructing and looking at "issues" in our culture. I remember reading  an essay about a Chinese student who came to this country for graduate  work in English. He describes the manner of writing that he learned as  "pealing an onion." I always liked that way. I don't know if I would be  able to change my research/prose style, since that is what I learned.

  Another interesting thing that I was fascinated with during grad.  school, was the French Feminist theory on language. Helene Cixious (sp)  and two other French women (Irigaray and the other, I can't remember)  go into the biological determination of language--the male orgasm and  the female orgasm and mother nurturing pieces of language. I know that  I am only touching on a very  small part of their discussion, but  it has certainly stayed with me, and that has guided me in poetry.

Just got asked a question from a friend related to the
presence of "really very" innovative journals. I
wonder if you might give some examples (share the
wealth, and maybe this has been done before) of those
journals - print/online - that you consider particular
examples of those seeming to be actively focused on
encouraging innovative work. I understand, however,
that one individual's innovative by be another's
bor----ing. Your time'll be appreciated.

Best,
Alexander Jorgensen

Raunchland (although whether it's a journal or what it is, i'm not sure)
Typo Magazine
conjunctions
Milk
la petite zine
Drunken Boat
blazeVOX
Red China
new american writing
the argotist online

Alex,

I take it you've seen Wilson's subsequent post to the list by now.
Regardless of whether you're in digest format or not, you could still
reply to him directly. And as I said before, I don't mind seeing the
submissions - I actually enjoy it. I was just thinking that there
might be people who would rather not have their bios and submissions
seen by the whole Poetics List community if it wasn't absolutely
necessary.

Mark, I'm not following you.  If I say "Susan was raped" -- I didn't
say "by" anyone, and that's just the point -- you're saying that
we've thereby presumed the identity of the rapist?  That the focus is
thereby on the UNNAMED party?

That just doesn't compute, either logically or culturally, either in
terms of identity or focus.  If I say "The ball was hit," we
certainly don't know who hit the ball, and the focus is certainly not
on the hit-ter.

Unless I'm missing something here?

As to the question of who is/is not the agent of the rape:  yes, the
context is overdetermining (as above), and said context for
incidences of rape is fairly well documented here in the U.S., which
context has served in general (historically) to obscure the male
agency that's at stake when women are raped.  (Unless, for instance,
the allegation is racialized, in which case the dynamic is somewhat
more complex.)

I'm not sure why I'm stating the obvious here, at any rate -- I know
that you know all this.  It was a tough row in this country simply to
get people to acknowledge that women of so many walks of life don't
"deserve" to be raped (by, well, men).  That struggle continues in
other countries, of course (and even here in this country).  And that
struggle is surely, surely marked by our language practices.  How
could it not be?

Re Navajo culture, about which I know very little indeed:  I'm
perfectly willing to wax ethnocentric (if you will) about this and
observe, if need be, that Native populations are not necessarily
immune to charges of sexism.  I don't see where that gets us, in any
case, re the present discussion.

What are we talking about?

Best,

Joe

Thoughtful List members may appreciate this brief essay by=20
Victor Hanson. It dispassionately presents the two major=20
views on Iraq without name-calling or prejudgment. Some may=20
even find it thought-provoking. -Eric





www.victorhanson.com

*December 1, 2006**

Two versions of what we should do next.*
by Victor Davis Hanson


Five years after September 11, and three-and-a-half years=20
after toppling Saddam Hussein, the U.S. is almost as angry=20
at itself as it is at the enemy. Two quite antithetical=20
views of the war on terror  --  and indeed, the entire=20
American role in the Middle East  --  are now crystallizing.

Ideology and political affiliation are no longer necessarily=20
touchstones to either opinion  --  not at a time when /The=20
Nation/ and /The American Conservative/ share the same views=20
on Iraq and the role of the United States abroad. Republican=20
senators like Chuck Hagel call for withdrawal, while=20
Democrats like a Joe Liebermann do not.

Republican realists are welcomed by liberal Democrats, who=20
want nothing to do with the neo-Wilsonian neo-conservatives=20
that once would have seemed more characteristic of liberal's=20
erstwhile idealism. It is not just that public=20
intellectuals, politicians, generals, and journalists
have different views, but their views themselves are=20
different in almost every 24-hour news cycle. Even the Bush=20
administration at times seems torn, gravitating between both=20
schools of thought.

While there are dozens of variants to the following two=20
divergent positions, they represent a clear enough picture=20
of the present divide.

*The Majority Opinion*
The new majority school of thought  --  often described as=20
the more nuanced and more sophisticated  --  seems to=20
conclude that the "global war on terror" (if that's even=20
what it ever really was) is insidiously winding down to a=20
police matter. Billions spent in lives and treasure in Iraq
did not make us any safer; the passing of time, the=20
dissipation of passions, and increased vigilance did.

We haven't had another 9/11. Al Qaeda is probably scattered.=20
Both Iraq and Afghanistan are exhibiting the usual, generic=20
Middle East insanity that is largely beyond our own powers=20
of remedy.

Rogue states in the region will ultimately be dealt with, as=20
in the pre-Bush II past, by a sort of containment  --=20
whether through retaliatory and punitive air strikes,=20
foreign aid concessions, shuttle diplomacy, no-fly zones, or=20
embargoes and boycotts.

If there ever were need for strong military action and=20
invasion, that time is clearly past, at least for now. The=20
long-term negative effects would more than outweighed any=20
short-term benefits  --  as we see from the repercussion of=20
the mess in Iraq and possibly Afghanistan as well.

In this way of thinking, an all-encompassing Islamic=20
fundamentalism that threatens the very survival of the West=20
is at best mostly a fantasy  --  at worst, a license for the=20
U.S. to intervene globally (often against our interests)=20
with the excuse of "fighting terror."

Certainly, there exists nothing as melodramatic as "Islamic=20
fascism." That is a misnomer that needlessly alienates=20
millions of moderate Muslims. And such reckless and inexact=20
nomenclature clumsily ignores both the history and all the=20
key fissures  --  Shiite/Sunni; Hamas/Hezbollah;=20
theocracy/autocracy/ monarchy; Persian/Arab/Kurd/Turk;
etc.  --  of the complex Islamic world.

Instead, the United States, in pragmatic fashion, needs to=20
address regional problems, particularly with more=20
sophisticated, and less ideological, remedies.

Hamas and its rivals exist largely because of the occupied=20
West Bank: force Israel back to its 1967 borders, and=20
Palestinian grievances  --  and the violence  --  largely=20
vanish, as the United States at last is freed from much of=20
the old Pavlovian hatred so endemic in the Arab World.
Radical bluster from the West Bank can sometimes sound=20
creepy, but it is largely braggadocio, or perhaps a cry from=20
the heart, and thus will quietly go away once the=20
Palestinians have their own autonomous state with=20
internationally recognized borders that reflect pre-1967=20
reality.

Hezbollah is not really a global terrorist network, but an=20
offshoot of the trouble in Lebanon. It can be handled in=20
part by granting concessions to Syria (such as an Israeli=20
withdrawal from the Golan Heights), winning promises from=20
Israel to be proportionate in responding to occasional (but=20
mostly ineffectual) border provocations, and seeking more=20
equitable political representation for Lebanese Shiites.

Iran is a danger, but not a fatal one. It can be balanced by=20
Sunni sheikdoms in the Gulf and checked by multilaterally=20
sponsored and enforced sanctions authorized by the United=20
Nations.

As far as America goes, the old method of balancing one=20
autocracy against another, with occasional but quiet and=20
respectful lectures about good behavior and reform, is,=20
however regrettably, often about as much as we can do.=20
Sporadic violence against individual Americans can be
dealt with through indictments, international policing, and,=20
/in extremis/, an occasional air strike.

In general, internal security measures, such as wiretaps,
Guantanamo-like detention centers abroad, and the Patriot=20
Act, were of limited, if any, efficacy in thwarting another=20
9/11. They now probably pose as great a threat to our=20
freedoms as do the terrorists.

Indeed, September 11 in proper hindsight seems more and more=20
to have been a sort of fluke, a lucky strike by al Qaeda,=20
predicated both on their sanctuary in Afghanistan and our=20
own somnolence. Both have since been largely addressed. So=20
the specter of another attack of a similar magnitude may=20
well have passed. In some ways, our over-reaction to the
bogeyman of "Islamic fascism" has made us less safe, by=20
gratuitously creating new enemies where none previously existed.

However unwise, removing Saddam Hussein may have had some=20
initial utility. But now any benefit is overshadowed by a=20
messy civil war, whose violence is only exacerbated by the=20
presence of American troops that have long overstayed both=20
their welcome and their usefulness.

The best solution to Iraq is to begin now a steady, but=20
sure, unilateral withdrawal under the rubric of=20
"redeployment" ? with sincere hopes that three years of our=20
blood and treasure should have been enough to jumpstart=20
democracy, and with even more sincere regrets if they have
not. In short, Iraq has turned into an unfortunate, but=20
predictable, fiasco, and it is time to cut it loose with as=20
little blowback as possible.

Anti-Americanism in the Middle East and Europe is largely a=20
phenomenon of George Bush's idiosyncratic manners and his=20
once-loud advocacy of preemption and unilateralism,=20
particularly in March 2003. With his retirement, things will=20
gradually settle down to the general equilibrium of the Bush=20
I and Clinton eras.

There are indeed dangers on the horizon with nuclear=20
proliferation, threats to wipe out Israel, and endemic=20
terrorism. But as soon as the United States and the West are=20
out of Iraq, become a neutral and honest broker between the=20
Israelis and Palestinians, and avoid gratuitous slurs
against Islam (such as the pope's unfortunate remarks or the=20
needlessly hurtful Danish cartoons), our reputation will=20
improve and Muslim hostility will subside  --  and with it=20
any popular support for militants like Osama bin Laden.

*The Minority Brief*
We really are in a global war. Its dimensions are hard to=20
conceptualize since our enemies, while aided and abetted by=20
sympathetic Middle Eastern dictatorships, claim no national=20
affinity. Indeed, the terrorists deliberately mask the role=20
of their patrons. The latter, given understandable fears of=20
the overwhelming conventional power of the United States=20
military, deny culpability.

In an age of globalization and miniaturized weapons of mass=20
destruction, it is even more difficult to convince Western=20
publics that they may well face peril from state-sponsored=20
terrorists every bit as great as what the /Wehrmacht/,=20
Imperial Japan, or the Red Army once posed.

While there are regional theaters of conflict predicated on=20
local grievances  --  as in the multiplicity of fighting=20
during World War II in China, Ethiopia, Poland, Finland,=20
France, North Africa, the Balkans, Russia, the Pacific, etc.=20
  --  there is nevertheless once more a transnational=20
ideology that seeks to force its worldviews on others.

Like fascism or Communism, Islamism galvanizes millions with=20
its reductionist claims of Western liberal culpability for=20
widely diverse Muslim gripes from Afghanistan to the West=20
Bank. Rather than seeing a plethora of grievances that can=20
be individually addressed, it is more valuable and accurate=20
to understand the problem as a general complaint
that in turn manifests itself in different regions and=20
circumstances. While Cypriots or Tibetans don't blow=20
themselves up over lost land or honor, those energized with=20
Islamist ideology often do. While Hindu, Christian, or=20
Buddhist fundamentalists don't appreciate popular culture
mocking their religion, Islamists are the most likely to=20
assassinate or threaten the novelist or cartoonist as the=20
supposed blasphemer.

Islamic fascism exists, then, as a reactionary creed that=20
sees traditional Islamic culture threatened with=20
Western-inspired global liberalization and modernization.=20
Drawing on the Middle East's sense of misery and=20
victimization by others, its narrative harkens back to a
purer age.

Once upon a time, the truly devout defeated their enemies=20
and lived a morally pure life under a caliphate of like=20
believers. That universal rule of Islam is at last once more=20
attainable  --  given the general decadence of the=20
postmodern West, the illegitimacy and vulnerability of
most Middle Eastern governments, and the simple fact that=20
vast petroleum reserves, coupled with jihadist fervor, can=20
be translated into militarily powerful, high-tech forces=20
that will obtain superiority over the crusading infidel.

On the home front, demoralization and a sort of cultural=20
relativism are far more worrisome than the Patriot Act and=20
related measures. By the prior benchmarks of the wartime=20
administrations of Lincoln, Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman, and=20
Nixon, these measures are relatively innocuous  --
and yet have done much to prevent another attack on the=20
United States.

It was not the Patriot Act that banned operas, condemned=20
cartoons, allowed films to be ostracized, or muzzled=20
teachers, but Western self-censorship and fear. Jihadists=20
brilliantly drew on boilerplate anti-Western arguments from=20
Western elites, and when they recycled tired charges of=20
imperialism, racism, and colonialism they found them
surprisingly effective at undermining Western morale.

Furthermore, September 11 was no fluke, but the logical=20
culmination of two disastrous prior American policies:=20
appeasement and cynical realism.

By not responding to a decade of prior attacks in East=20
Africa, New York, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, and withdrawing=20
ignominiously from Lebanon to Mogadishu, we gave the fatal=20
impression that a terrorist could strike the United States=20
with near impunity  --  given our addiction to the good
life that we would not endanger at any cost. And by ignoring=20
the abject failures of Middle East autocracies, we=20
inadvertently ensured the second requisite to 9/11:=20
dictatorial regimes that allowed terrorists free rein
to scapegoat their own failures onto the infidel West.

The remedy, then, is to respond forcefully to terrorists and=20
their sponsors, while simultaneously appealing to the people=20
of the Islamic world that the United States is no longer=20
cynically realist  --  but is actively working to promote=20
consensual government throughout the region to address their=20
lack of representation in their own affairs. That is
not naivet=E9, but rather both the right and smart thing to=20
do. Unlike the majority opinion that offers the chimera of=20
stability through short-term expediency, the more costly,=20
difficult, and ambitious minority view addresses conditions=20
that more likely will lead to a lasting peace.

Iraq is far from lost, but in fact, despite the negative=20
coverage, has a viable elected government that slogs on=20
through the worst assaults imaginable. The coalition=20
government includes all voices in the country. And that=20
explains why, at least so far, there really is not a classic
civil war in which one faction, with clearly defined goals=20
of governance, tries to assume power, backed by substantial=20
military force and broad public support.

The present strategy of Iraqization is the correct one, both=20
for ethical and practical reasons. If we don't withdraw=20
precipitously, there is a good chance that Iraqi forces, and=20
government flexibility, will eventually pacify Baghdad and=20
its environs  --  where almost all the violence in the=20
country is confined. Along with the stabilization of
Afghanistan, and positive democratic developments in=20
Lebanon, the Middle East is in flux, but with at least a=20
chance of broad-based reform not seen in a half century.

Withdrawals from Lebanon and Gaza, while strategically and=20
politically understandable, brought little commensurate=20
peace to Israel. And while negotiations about borders are=20
vital to a lasting peace between Israel and the=20
Palestinians, a large number of the latter group believe=20
that Israel itself can be unraveled through a mixture of=20
terrorism, rocketry, and on-again-off-again diplomacy. Their=20
real grievance against Israel is not so much its post-1967=20
retention of conquered land  --  there were 20 years of war=20
prior to then  --  but its Westernized presence and daily
example of success in a sea of failure. The pathologies of=20
the Middle East were there prior to Israel, and will=20
probably be enhanced rather than ameliorated by a sense of=20
Israeli appeasement and American-induced concessions.

Finally, we are still one lax day away from another=20
September 11, and will continue to be so until the currency=20
and appeal of radical Islamism are history. Anti-Americanism=20
can be crystallized by George Bush and his policies, but it=20
was a pre-existing pathology that will survive long after he=20
is gone  --  inasmuch as it is a symptom of a much larger=20

Hi
Simply re-stating the chosen terms of your magazine's existence neither
explains nor justifies them. Neither does the suggestion that many hundreds
of other magazines might think differently to yours. I understand a mag
whose restrictions privilege under-represented categories or regional
interests.But privileging Americans as such? Wow. Beyond parody.Still, it's
only rock 'n' roll. By the way, I'm a big Americophile (if that's the word)
so spare me the cheap shots.
Cheers

Offhand I would add No: A Journal of the Arts and Word For/Word: A Journal of New Writing (http://www.wordforword.info/vol10/index.htm).

What this "really innovative" might be is the more interesting question to me. Is there, any, left? I personally try not to worry about what's "innovative". Being programmatically "new" seems as ill-fated and two-dimensional as being staunchly "traditional". I don't write just to invent new tricks to impress the hot boys (though I do hope to impress, nonetheless). I don't think anything I've done so far is in any way "new," although people (the few who do) (okay, my friends) seem always to tag me "experimental".

Hi, all.

My book, New Jersey, comes out in February from University of Wisconsin Press. I'm reading in Madison and Milwaukee in late March and am looking to read in Chicago and elsewhere in that area of the country during this trip. Anyone got some good suggestions/contacts? Please backchannel me.

And, really, I'd read anywhere on the globe this coming year, so if you're an organizer looking for folks to read in your series, backchannel me, and I'll send you the press release for my book.

thanks,
Betsy

hi there--oops. i see that i misremembered "mississippi" as "minnesota" somehow! big difference. i know very little about mississippi; but i did spend a little time in oxford a few springs ago.

i noticed that some of my line breaks do seem to have changed in the email. in the first poem i sent, the first, second, and fourth parts are supposed to be like paragraph structure (flush right if possible); only the third is supposed to have "poetic" line breaks. i wonder if i should bother ian, to tell him that.

ok; hope you've had a great weekend. drop a line whenever you'd like. best, pam

FYI, I'm also on digest but my replies still go directly to the original
poster.  I have to go out of my way to send a reply to the list, as I =
did
this one.  It's probably something you set up in the listserv settings,

Dan,
Reread Wilson's submission guidelines: he's very
insistent, "REPLIES ONLY" will be considered. Since
I'm in digest format, that leaves me not much choice,
I'm afraid. Just playing it safe: my apologies for
cluttering up people's inboxes.
Yours,

"Around us, everything is writing; that's what we must perceive. Everything
is writing. It's the unknown in oneself, one's head, one's body. Writing is
not even a reflection, but a kind of faculty one has, that exists to one
side of oneself, parallel to oneself: another person who appears and comes
forward, invisible, gifted with thought and anger, and who sometimes,
through her own actions, risks losing her life. Into the night." --

this is for those who have sites, not blogs. blogs usually come with search
functionality but you have to roll your own if you have a site. here's how.

visit http://google.com/services/free.html and follow the instructions.

the search results are drawn from pages that are indexed by google.

you can see examples of this functionality at http://vispo.com (red search
box), at http://vispo.com/guests (same thing only black), and at
http://turbulence.org .

the search results page is customizable in its colors and you can put yer
logo on the search results page. haven't been able to figure out how to get
the google logo off the search results page though.

search functionality is very useful if you have a large site that has a lot
of pages. the poetics list would have a lot of subscribers in that
situation.

We all know that our small literary communities, tiny bookshops that show
indie films and host poetry readings, have been freaking eaten alive by
places like Borders, Barnes & Noble, and Wal-Mart.  This is ESPECIALLY TRUE
in frontier towns like St. Louis!



And you might also know that grassroots, independent book publishers and the
events they sponsor are among the most effective weapons we have against
life-sucking corporate giants.



Sometimes capitalism sucks.



Please help out by going to http://www.observable.org/dollar/ and put a buck
in the hat, and we'll link to your website. In Observable's previous dollar
campaign, gentle citizens donated over $1000 bucks, and that money went to
printing new books, fancy letterpressed posters, hosting poets, partnering
with many other endeavors, and a whirlwind of other things.



In this way, Observable sheds a little bit of light in a city that, while it
might not really be the "most dangerous" (thanks, U.S. News), IS a place so
overrun with megabookstores that there's really only one independent left
standing.



HELP!!! Just one buck, svp!



HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!

I have one of those in my family.  He actually _asks_ if there is a poetry
event to go to when we haven't been to one in awhile.  I think he might end
up writing poetry inspite of himself one of these days.   There are several
very consistent non-poets who show up at many readings around here (Buffalo
area).  Some of them are not even related to poets as far as I know. . . so
no family loyalty involved.  And one of the local poetry reading curators is
not a poet himself but is preserving his poet wife's reading series. . .

oh no, not so, said the bee...  my sister and daughter both love to read
poetry, learn it by heart, but do not write--well, maybe my daughter a
bit, but not my sister.  my grandfather knew gallons of po by heart and
did not write.  however, i think there are a lot more writers than will
admit to being so--maybe not "good" writers, but so many of my students
secretly write poetry.  it is an affair of the heart for them.  best, gabe

In Amsterdam, until 2005, a fine American poet, Lee Bridges The
Cannabis Poet, hustled his books for years in the coffeeshops, and
people from all backgrounds and from all over the world bought them.
He made his living at it. John Sinclair has recently brought poetry
readings to the Cannabis College and poetry performances to the
Cannabis Cup as well as to his broadcasts on Radio Free Amsterdam.  A
Dutch friend of mine is translating my first book into Dutch, just
because he likes the poems. He knows them better than I do.

I get your question and am surprised at my answer.

 Peace

I think it's imortant not just to limit oneself to a choice of flipping the
sentence between active and passie. ther eare lots of other parts to play
with as well like how we call out the names that we use. How about playing
with the nouns were

O John, raper of Susan ... (that construction leaves space for us to speak
to him a bit more)

or Susan. Rape. John?
Rape. John and Susan

or

raped you, Susan, O John.

I mean do we speak of these people so that we can look at them (that's what
i think those more still nouns make us do. but maybe we can not just look
but converse...

the right language is needed to to it though, i quite a agree.

(hegel's passage on sense certainty (A.1.80-108) is extremely accessible,
he's good at this stuff and i bet that if i/we undertood the master slave
dialetic linguistically that would be good for this too.)

My father was one such person.  He was a little bit in the "want to"
category, or "at one time wanted to."  But the level of his
attentiveness to poetry far outweighed any regret.  He bought new poetry
books as soon as they were published, and as a result had pretty much
everything published in Ireland 1960-1975, when he died.  He had a great
love for one particular poet, Patrick Kavanagh, so he had multiple
copies of Kavanagh's books, plus everything Kavanagh published,
including Kavanagh's newpaper Kavanagh's Weekly, which ran for 13 weeks,
and which is very rare.
His love for Kavanagh led him out to other contemporary Irish poets.  He
bought everything of Kavanagh's, read everything, clipped everything out
of the newspaper, from the 1950s on.  When Kavanagh died in 1967, his
love of poetry was well and truly generalized.  He also had a great love
for, and interest in, theology, and every sort of questioning.  He was a
meteorologist and mathematician.  Even with 8 children, he made a space
for himself, on Sunday mornings, to read poetry.  I think he was shy of
"poets," as Ireland misshaped them, but definitely a great lover of
poetry, in Irish and English.

At the same time, mIEKAL, you have a point.  But I think of poetry as a
one-by-one art.  My father was certainly such a one.

And I forgot to say, architects (if Rhode Island School of Design is
anything to go by) use poetry to articulate ideas.

Maya Lin is a great example of sculptor/architect whose concepts and
initial workings-out are poetic (I hope I can defend this statement if
challenged).

I haven't come across a department at RISD yet where poetry is not in
use.  I'm susceptible to seeing it, of course.

On another subject, have any of you ever experienced a ferocious hunger
for poetics???  I'm in the throes of that right now.  Usually it's
poetry.  But just now -- poetics!!!

Don't meet me at a bus-stop anyone!

Don't apologize, mIEKAL. I can't find any, either. Maybe I've met a few over
the years, but I can't remember enough of them to open my hand and start
counting on a finger.

I don't know the why of it. Maybe it's because throughout their lives people
are conditioned to consider poetry as difficult, inaccessible, etc. And a
poetry reading does require more concentration than going to an art show or
a club.

The jazz world isn't all that different. Most of the people I know who like
jazz have played an instrument at one time in their lives, even if they
aren't "musicians."

I don't have any answers, just observations.

YES. Lots and lots. There were well over 150 people at Robin Blaser's =
book
launch last Friday, 8th December, and I'd say there were probably maybe =
at
most 40 of them poets (that I knew or knew of, anyway, and I know most
Vancouver poets at least by sight) -- an astonishing mix of oldish, old,
youngish, young, musicians. painters, photographers, geographers, =
printers,
librarians, students, u.s.w. (though VERY few academics from English
Departments -- but gosh! George Bowering was there, and so was I =
(there's
two acadmics, even tho, ahem, emeriti). And, well, I've met all sorts of
people at poetry readings and browsing poetry books in bookshops and =
even
chattering in pubs -- I vividly remember a long-haul truck-driver I met =
in a
roadside stop in Nevada who was absolutely crazy about William Blake, =
kept
his complete poems along with those of other romantics (Wordsworth keats =
and
especially Shelley) in his cab, wanted to talk about Northrop Frye's =
book on
WB (which I hadn't read), was fascinated to meet an English person out =
in
the western wilds (not that in those days I had much interest in poetry, =
at
my age I preferred girls or even, oh my, women) -- but that was in the =
late
1950s, and I guess truck-drivers might have other interests nowadays; I
really don't dare guess -- he said quite a few long-haul truckers and
railroad workers read poetry a lot -- the short poem really terrific =
when
your life is full of interruptions; better than prose any day. And think
about who used to read (and maybe still does?) poets like Muriel =
Rukeyser or
George Oppen or William Carlos Williams.=20

On average I'd say readings at the Kootenay School of Writing are =
usually
90-95% poets attending; readings at other venues around town probably =
around
60-70%, lots of students I guess. But then Goh Poh Seng read last week =
at
Simon Fraser U to around 25 people, 75% writers; readings at ArtSpeak (a
local gallery) draws a much wider range of attendance.

Big fashionable big time readings in major venues (e.g. by Michael =
Ondaatje)
draw lots and lots of, um, let's say Matrons and their cohorts, a bit =
like
going to the opera.=20

Out in the boonies, or wherever, things may be different. Who can tell, =
we
live such insulated lives.

I think it's time to re-define audience.
I think who ever 'we is' get stuck in divisions between 'populism' and
'mandarinism'.
Somehow populism - as poetry -  means dumbing it down to just folks - or,
conversely, folks who are 'exceptional' and rise up  above their rank, and
the 'exceptionals' who somehow magically manage to manufacture language that
reaches across to 'folks'.
Nathaniel Mackey goes 'up', and Garrison Keillor (sp?) takes it 'down'.
The plot is really familiar. And off putting, too.
On top of which - given the available paradigms of moving 'up' or 'down'  -
it's kind of exhausting, and a lot of people just give up on 'audience
development' as part of their curve, no matter what be the original
intention. It seems like too much work to go out there 'again and again' -
that is out there beyond our kith and kin fellow poets, be us mandarin or
populist, academic or outside academia, etc.
That's the dark, dumb side of it all. Thinking one's work don't mean much to
anybody and the Norton Canon is mainly a muzzle rather than a source of
aspiration. Blah de blah.
In actuality I think it can be quite different. I have always appreciated
Ron Silliman's ancient dictum (yes, Ron's been making dictums for a long
time!) but the one I like, "audiences are built one by one". Of course,he
was wanting to build audiences for Language Poetry and he was or could be
merciless to a fault with his assertiveness and it was to an audience of
primarily young poet initiates. (I can remember back in the seventies a
therapist friend asking me, "What is Language Poetry?" - she had received
two new clients (young poets) in one week who had been totally thrown off
their bearings and looking for help!!))
Lately I have been thinking that the luxury of listening and taking poetry
seriously (at least outside the MFA and Creative Writing major zones) is
partly a function of the economy and media. Most people who orbit in the
current economy - as say my 26 year old daughter -  are velcro'd into 'the
fix' - it takes an enormous amount of will power and self-discipline to
create a space/zone and/or go to a space to listen to poems (let alone write
them). I won't elaborate on 'the fix', but I suspect we can bet an Ipod, a
cell phone and cable/DVD  and meTube on what the competing factors are for
the young and dollar. Beat that at great risk!
And yet it happens. But I think its helpful to find and develop zones where
it can happen and where it is not dependent on a totally poet-centric
audience (tho that can be totally great on a different sharpen your tools
level).
Just a small personal example. Lately I been doing workshops with people who
are fifty and older with a wide variety of educations, some, if any at all.
I don't hesitate to read Stein, Sappho, Niedecker, Reznikoff, Langston
Hughes, etc., etc.  And discuss. I always find it sweetly wonderful how
people - most often with no back ground in poetry are taken by words, almost
like a food. And they will argue, agree, and take the poem's charge
sometimes way beyond itself into newly imagined worlds.
Last week in a group in the Fillmore District in San Francisco - once the
site of great jazz venues - I read an ancient Chinese poem in a Rexroth
translation about loss (image: waning moon). I asked for people to come up
with images for loss. Edward Dillard, an 85 year old man, a tailor by trade
who still dresses in his pale blue custom made suit and hat - think BeBop)
related the story of the close friendship of Charles Mingus and Charles
Parker. "When Charles Parker died, you could hear it in Mingus'
 compositions for several years after."
As it also turned out, while in San Francisco, he had made suits for them
both.

Anyway, I suspect, my point is that if people have space and conditions and
the permission to listen, poetry can still do its work - and it's important
not to make assumptions about what x, y or z audience requires to be pleased
(populist or mandarin, etc.) People can actually like and/or be attracted to
stuff that is initially opaque and not immediately understandable. That it
is possible (for the poet) to be educated by an audience, as well as
participate in the education of an audience. It's just that we might
discover those audiences in what might be considered strange or unexpected
places.

Once I asked an elderly woman what she thought of the day's workshop. "It
sure beats looking at an empty wall," she said. Inside, to keep a belief in
the poem, I think we have to assume - whether folks are totally subsumed in
technology or not - many are looking at walls (inside or outside themselves)
and words (poems) can continue to feed the hunger.

At least, I would like to bet on that.

mIEKAl,
I've known a bunch. Mostly academics in literature of
some kind, but that's probably because of my crowd,
I'm afraid. They exist, though, discreet lovers though
they be.
About to attract the ire of the anti-academics,
Amicalement,

For me, this is why I work so hard to get poetry into other non-poetic or
even not-so-artistic events.  Poetry readings are great, but I feel that we
need to get out of the coffee houses and bookstores and get to people.  A
few examples/anecdotes/whathaveyou . . .

A few years ago, I coordinated a two-day stage at an arts and crafts
festival, a big community event that happens over Father's Day weekend that
runs the gamut from car shows to artists doing caricatures, selling
ceramics, etc.  When I first got to our stage I was dismayed because we
didn't really have our own space and we were set up in what was ostensibly
the food court.  After a couple of minutes I kicked myself, realizing what
an amazing gift we had been given.  We were in a space that EVERYONE was
going to come to and where they would be sitting for extended periods of
time.  And lo and behold, the people who were sitting there eating corn dogs
and mini-donuts and resting their feet were attentive and those in the front
3 or 4 rows generally stayed until we had a changeover in poets or sets.
And I'll bet almost none of those people would have come and listened to us
if we'd had a "poetry tent."  At best, a few would have stood just inside
the door for a minute or two and then moved on, but mostly we would have
been reading for the same people who come to ALL the readings and/or for the
friends we dragged out to see us.

I'm trying to find some brave souls to stand outside the Metrodome and read
poetry as a football game is letting out.

I also have a friend doing a little temp work as a bell-ringer for the
Salvation Army and when he complained that it was boring, I suggested that
he start reading poetry while at his post.  I hope he'll do it.

Finally, I've been trying to put together an "art mob," based on the idea of
a "flash mob" that would gather in different places around town on short
notice and read poetry, dance, do a scene from a play, etc.  Still trying to
get it to take off, but I hope eventually it well.

It's great when "non-poets" or "non-artists" trek out to see us, but I
believe that we need to make ourselves more a part of everyone's daily life
and part of public life rather than expecting them to come to us or
lamenting as some people do (NOT finger pointing at this list, but thinking
of other experiences) that no one ever reads poetry or comes to poetry
events.

Don't apologize, mIEKAL. I can't find any, either. Maybe I've met a few over
the years, but I can't remember enough of them to open my hand and start
counting on a finger.

I don't know the why of it. Maybe it's because throughout their lives people
are conditioned to consider poetry as difficult, inaccessible, etc. And a
poetry reading does require more concentration than going to an art show or
a club.

The jazz world isn't all that different. Most of the people I know who like
jazz have played an instrument at one time in their lives, even if they
aren't "musicians."

I don't have any answers, just observations.

Jenny Holzer did a text piece in Providence recently ("For RISD"). One
of my students asked her baldly if she considered her texts poetry, and
she said no, certainly not.  She actually said that she hopes never to
write again -- because she has excellent collaborators who are poets.

I have a good friend who started a local poetry reading group.  She's never
written a line in her life.  Another friend who's a psychiatrist used to
attend these meetings.  She's a big poetry reader but doesn't write poems.
Unfortunately the world is also populated with many non-poets who DO write
(not necessarily) poetry.

As someone who lives in the "boonies" I can confirm that I encounter
non-poets who read poetry surprisingly often.

figuring out which poets need which meds? I'd be more interested in
psychologists reading poetry.

Lisa, I so agree! The boonies is the place to be! :-) The city has its =20
wonders too!


My varying responses:

At least in the US, we are currently encountering art and "the =20
creative" in so many more places than was considered "appropriate" in =20
the past. The non-artist/non-writer may not have as big an appetite =20
for poetry, or art in general, but does that mean they do not want it =20
at all?!?!!?!


There are many who read poetry and never write it. I suppose whether =20
they WANT to write poetry is another matter, since the answer to that =20
can be very elusive, residing in one's noggin for a lifetime and never =20
being said (or done). Some might say every person has the potential to =20
be a poet, but are lacking in what feeds such talent. [I can't say I =20
even know if I agree with that or not.]


Poetry is becoming more accessible all the time... I see poetry in the =20
mainstream music scene (alongside many non-poetic compositions, okay), =20
on the TV in commercials (the "bar" is being raised all the time for =20
the advertising industry -- when was the last time you heard one of =20
those dinky jingles of the early TV years), poetry events are =20
saturating the city scene, and all the time more volumes of poetry are =20
being released by publishers and writers alike. Possibly the everyday =20
person doesnt need poetry in book form because they are being =20
spoon-fed poetry in other forms?


Let's not get into "what is and is not poetry", an endless debate, =20
unless you really want to... I have been there with friends and it is =20
not a pretty place... There are many types of POETRY, some more or =20
less well-crafted... still POETRY. [I personally appreciate MOST types =20
of poetry.]

I must admit that after thirty years of publishing my writing and going to readings, I can think of very few people who have participated as long without calling themselves poets.

I don't write or teach poetry; just read when I have the chance, which
lately has been less often.

When I lived in Seattle there'd be a range of attendees for the various
reading series/venues similar to the one noted by Peter Quartermain,
though I may be less sure that the painters, musicians etc who showed up
at the smaller readings were actively reading a lot of poetry rather
than being supportive of the endeavors of their friends.

Here in Fort Worth, there've been very few other civilians at the
readings I've been to. But I've also been to far fewer readings here, so
I'm not sure how good an indicator this may be.

Sometimes I think we poets are working in the most unloved art form.

Since I put up pages for AvantRetro (poetry) and Whiskey Bucket Blues
Review (music) on the same day two months ago, the two pages have had
close to the same number of 'profile views'--number of people coming
by--but on the poetry site the ratio of people listening to poems/profile
views is very close to 1/1--on the music site there are 3000 listens for
the 1000 profile views -- this means that on the poetry site people tend
to listen to the one poem that automatically comes up when they visit but
they're not real motivated to click on a 2nd poem and 3rd (these are poems
that get excellent responses at readings) 2 things baffle me--that so many
people even find the poetry site, but also that so few are motivated to
listen to more of the poetry

Another little observation is that the myspace music people who send us
notes are inclined to be complimentary--'nice sound' 'love yr blues' I
could say this is the norm among those who choose to send a note
etc--whereas the typical note from a poet is more likely to say 'come to
my reading' 'read my new poem'  'buy my book'

These are just observations which are related, I think, to the question of
whether non-poets read poetry

has anyone taken into account "casual" or "indirect" contact with
poetry, as for instance when a poem appears in a magazine alongside a
prose article? I'm thinking of the New Yorker, which is the only
"mainstream" mag I read, but I guess there must be others printing a mix
of non-/fiction prose and poetry in one place.

no way to track how many eyeballs are being caught by poetry published
in the New Yorker et al., but that's certainly a way for non-poets to be
exposed to some of the latest (albeit conservative, non-experimental
(?)) poetry. what other national, general interest mags publish poetry
on an every-issue basis?=20

maybe the larger question to ask is, how many people in the
English-speaking world (or North America, or the U.S., or however you
want to break it down) read poetry? how about somebody sponsors a survey
to do a statistical analysis and establish a census of poetry readers at
large?=20

I think about this issue from time to time, and while I would say a good number of my friends and acquaintances read poetry without describing themselves as poets, I think there is a problem here.

My girlfriend, to take a sort of random example, occasionally writes a little poem or something, and I quite like them, but she doesn't describe herself as a poet and takes her fiction writing much more seriously. And she does like and enjoy poetry, but I think it's possible the only living poets she reads are Alice Notley and me. And I think Alice Notley only because I bought her a copy of Descent of Allette as a present a while back and she really liked it. I think I've just about got her sold on Russell Edson, but we'll see. She is, by her own confession, a little intimidated by the contemporary poetry world and is I think content to sit back and wait for the tastemakers to make up their mind about whether a poet is worth reading before she's willing to put in the time to get familiar with a writer in the way that she has to be in order to really enjoy their work. I want to point out that
she's not a casual fan of poetry, either, and can recite work by the likes of Eliot, Dickinson, and WCW from memory. That a reader like her isn't particularly interested in engaging with contemporary poetry is, I think, symptomatic of the larger problem.

I can certainly understand where she's coming from. Contemporary poetry divides pretty easily into the large small poetry magazines and the small small poetry magazines. the large small magazines (poetry, the paris review, Fence and their ilk) are so inconsistent and generally bad that they hardly justify the cover price, particular in the paris review's case. with the small small magazines, the entire magazine itself is a bit of a crap shoot, and can either be very good or very bad. And often I'll find myself enjoying an issue of a small small magazine I picked up at a news stand and then I'll never see another issue again, not because it's ceased publication but because distribution is erratic. I'm not the type to buy a subscription, so that means I'm not going to read that magazine again if I never see it in the bookstores I haunt. It's very offputting to casual readership, and without casual readership it's very difficult to develop intense readership.

Combine that with the fact that poetry education, at least in the united states, is generally confined to a couple of disconnected units sandwiched between novel studies in the 11th and 12th grades, and that often all that's taught are the romantics, and in my very unusual case from what I've heard, the metaphysical poets, there just aren't a lot of people who learn HOW to read poetry in school.

This has pretty much been her stance; I think it's a fairly correct one.
Her work operates within specific locations, plays off the corpus of
language in a way reminiscent of language art (even ties in to Lawrence
Weiner for example), etc. It might have a poetics but I've never thought
of it as poetry. (In a sense everything is poetry, but it seems to make
sense to think about framing as well.)

I love her work btw - some of her installations and her Times Square
pieces for example were absolutely amazing.

Dan,

-- there are meds, and there are, well, _meds_ -- and sanity be damned --

-- if you want to hear a psychiatrist at their *least coherent, ask them to
explain a good poem

-- how does that differ from psychologists?

I've known a great many non-poets over the years who read poetry, in several
countries. In the United States a great many people I have known who read
poetry and never evinced the slightest interest in writing any--read it
often as a kind of spiritual/intellectual sustenance.  The favorite writers
by far were Whitman and Dickinson, who are understood as mystical, visionary
and despite being "canonical" figures, viewed very much as outsider types,
non-conformists in life and writing, willing to take on anything on their
own and having something of insight to share with fellow spirits. Bukowski
and the Beats also very popular with lot of non-poetry writing people,
though not to same extent as Whitman and Dicksinson.  Lot more people think
they can be Buk or a Beat than they do Walt or Emily after all, in terms of
writing or life.  Among non-poets who are artitss and musicians i've known
most popular poet is Rimbaud, along with often Baudelaire and Lautreamont.
A painter friend the other night told me he has just bought the latest
translations of Rimbaud--that there continue to be new ones attests to his
popularity.  My friend has now read al the english translations and several
of the bios in english.  Baudelaire and a few other French poets he likes.
Said a friend still in school told him abut Language poetry assigned and he
tried reading some but to him seemed "like the bleating of sheep in a flock,
fenced off from the world." (This guy is 27. Very good painter, too.)  For
over twenty years I don't know how many rock/punk/hard core musicians and
some jazz that have met Rimbaud is the favorite.  Patti Smith may have
something to do with it through time, as has long promoted his work.  She
also wrote the Intro for the recent second edition of Sixties classic ed. by
Angel Flores,  An Anthology of French Poetry from Nerval to Valery.  The
appeal is both the work and the life and what Olson calls  the "stance
towards reality".  The poetry doesn't make the readers change their minds
and become poets--it's part of strengthening their commitment to their own
art to read the works and learn of the lives.
     At a reading by Clayton Eshleman a few nights ago at Woodland Pattern
of poetry of Vallejo, a Peruvian Spanish Professor from UW-Milwaukee was
present to read the poetry in Vallejo's native Peruvian Spanish
pronunciations--and was asked if Vallejo read much in Peru.  He responded
that Vallejo is memorized from very early ages by school children in Peru,
as the national poet.  I asked the same gentleman last night at a talk by
Eshleman on cave paintings if the poetry of Oquendo y Amat is much known in
Peru.  He said yes it is very popular, both the poetry and story of his very
strange life.  (There are cults in Peru who make literal, except multiplied
many times, his book "5 Metros de poesia"--digging and carving it into the
sides of mountians.) In many countries I lived in, poetry is part of the
mandatory national curriculum, as an important part of the culture, to be
memorized, studied, known about.  (Or as a French friend said, amazed at  my
fanaticism for French poetry--"that's all stuff we get made to learn in
school, exam questions. I want to read weirdos of other countries--like you
do.")  I read poetry for decades without it ever occuring to me to even try
to write a poem.  What mattered was the effect the poets and their poetry
had on one's life, way of being in the world, seeing and hearing things,
finding things hidden in plain sight that are like the secrets you aren't
supposed to know--or exacerbate the ones you do--
         That's been my experience--a great deal of people read poetry who
don't think about writing it--and some do go from time to time to a poetry
reading--and some don't--the atmosphere of them can turn some  people off.
Their reading of poetry though plays a big part in their inner lives, in
trying to find other/more/better ways for themselves to exist in the world.

We had about 70 submissions over the weekend.   Thanks to all who saent work, and again, sorry for any confusion.  The phrase "backchannel reply" probably would have cleared it all up.  In any event, all decisions have been made and all notifications have gone out yea or nay.  The issue will go to press next week.

My experience with psychiatrists is that they're very surface-oriented
and want to get you out of the office w/pills in hand asap.
Psychologists want to explore the mental issues that are casuing the
patient distress. Applying those different approaches to reading
poetry - well, I'd be more interested in the psychologist's take.

Yes, but that's what they all say, the language art people, Larry Weiner
included. They don't think of what they do as poetry because their idea
of
poetry is so narrow and not at all informed by a knowledge of best
contemporary practice.
Holzer's confession that she has poet collaborators explains to me why
I'm been less and less impressed by her texts.

This has pretty much been her stance; I think it's a fairly correct one.

Her work operates within specific locations, plays off the corpus of=20
language in a way reminiscent of language art (even ties in to Lawrence=20
Weiner for example), etc. It might have a poetics but I've never thought

of it as poetry. (In a sense everything is poetry, but it seems to make=20
sense to think about framing as well.)

I love her work btw - some of her installations and her Times Square=20
pieces for example were absolutely amazing.

Thanks, I see. Sometimes I write poetry and sometimes I do not.
Sometimes I read it when I'm not writing it.

When First Looking Into Bay Poetics: San Francisco Responds


Stephanie Young assembles a diverse crew. She "asked friends" and
friends of friends. Terrific. I'm certain many a happy gang bang and
orgy executed to the enjoyment of all participants slowly came to in
just such fashion. Why not? There's a certain pleasure coming up
against the unexpected in such a situation. How did that get here, and
whose is it? For myself there certainly is enough work by friends,
mentors, and would-be crushes presented in this anthology that I would
seriously entertain the thought of attending such a bash.

Ever the purist, I read poetry for poetry's sake. I adore the gossip
and all (Sadly it's lacking here. I'd really like to know just who is
fucking who, or has. Which women prefer women, which men prefer men.
To leave it out of the work and distant is such a bore. The only
gossip available is gossip about the thing itself. How Williams is
that.), but the durability of the work arises from what is on the page
alone. I object on general principle to shoddiness. I don't care
whether it comes from Kathleen Fraser erecting her half-corpse of
influence to thrust out shoddy imitative Susan Howe or a fellow like
Stroffolino bemoaning his lack of "influence" in the
poetry/rock/acoustic/radio (which is it Chris?) world taking up space
in a text of supposed Poetics.  It's a sacred act for some of us.  For
others it appears a smudged half-shot for stardom and glory among the
living dead of blogs and cyberspace.

Bay Poetics thankfully does however have some surprises:  James
Meetze, that Whitmanesque failure; Alli Warren, those shifts of line;
Tanya Brolanski, someone who actually cares; Cynthia Sailers, finally
convincing blocks of verse; Brydie McPherson, somebody read their
Oppen; Elizabeth Treadwell, I never knew!; Yuri Hospodar, fun and
true, if a bit lite.  & of course there are the Disappointments, why
even mention: Hillman, Scalapino, Palmer, Cross, Cox, Cole, Koeneke,
Nealon, Smith, Tuntha-abas, Kaipa, etc. Here because of time put in or
friendships clung to, who knows or cares. & blessedly there are the
Solids: Kyger (without doubt up in Bolinas wondering what the hell
these people find in her work and how she got tangled up in their
company), Ratcliffe, Berkson, Killian, Joron (thank god for his essay,
a piece of thoughtful prose that is of actual use), Spahr, Robinson,
Murray, Gluck, Ballard, Sigo, and Mackey.

Does this sum anything up? No, of course not. The reader will find her
own highs and lows. This list is but the one meant for the city and
its lovers. The bay is theirs alone.

Holzer's concern is not texts or their quality [as poetry]...but texts as
decor, as consumable, etc.  Her ironic relationship to sincerity is what is
at stake.  The ironic relationship of texts in the environement to sincerity
or intent.  Et al.

Yes, but that's what they all say, the language art people, Larry Weiner

When I was writing I was thinking of Holzer's plaques, which would exist =
in
public without an author, like billboards, swimming pool rules, or =
graffiti
(though most is signed).  I think what's inherent in texts is they live =
on,
sort of like radiation, and can be picked up and infect the reader =
[perhaps
this is the sense of decor you refer to -- being ambient].  This is the
stuff of horror films and multimedia art.  Thinking of public texts or
signage as harmful or frustrated, confusing, authoritarian.  I think =
this is
what Holzer's art is about though I don't think I'm nailing it down -- =
and
it has implications for writers. =20

(Multimedia) artists have an interesting relationship to text.  I know =
you
get this already, but I wanted to say that there's no difference, to =
them,
between a urinal or a poem, as material.  I once read Paul McCarthy say =
he
had thought of Sylvia Plath as a metaphor, and in one of his videos =
someone
sticks their head in an oven (she's not a text but you feel me).  So, it
doesn't matter if the text is good or bad, since the form, rather than =
the
content (as meaningful), is at stake; though the text does have to =
function
in a certain way, or be a certain kind of thing (i.e. a provocative
announcement).  Take Mike Kelley's writings.  One of his 'poems' begins,
"Ladybird Johnson, on Arbor Day | Commanding plant a tree or bush to =
stay |
The stunning spread of US decay...", etc.  They're pretty good to read, =
but
they're just material, a component, of something more complex.  Kelley =
is a
better writer than Holzer, I think, which explains why his work is =
awesome
and she wants to hire poets (?).  Most texts used as material in art, I
notice, are pretty simple or simplistic, and suggestive rather than =
precise
in meaning.  Often tedious as well!  Hence Holzer, and a weakness in her
work, based as it is primarily on evocative texts that are not wonderful =
as
poetry or even thought.

Hey Patrick---

Luckily, it's not my responsibility to defend that book, or its
title, or even why the editor chose this particular piece of mine
(rather than the kind of writing called a poem, or writing perhaps
more relevant to the field of poetics),

but since you asked me a personal question about my piece in there,
which apparently you didn't like, I guess it is sort of my
responsibility
to write something about it. Not exactly a defense, and I certainly
don't expect it to make you like it, but just a little context. When
the editor came over to my house (I was wheelchair immobile) to take
some writing, what I was most excited by in that particular moment
was the memoir I was working on, so I tried to find an excerpt that
could kind of sort of stand on its own in a poetry-related venue.

I was excited about this kind of writing because 1) I had never been
a memory-based writer (funny how a near death experience can change
that)
or 2) had never really gone that far into a kind of prose that didn't
utilize (and even rely) on a more "poetics" or "academic" specialized
jargon, or that wasn't often 'overanalytical'; I was experimenting in
so-called "non-experimental" writing out of some kind of (deathbed)
feeling of urgent necessity. I never really got into a lot of so-
called 'quotidian' narrative-like poetry (of what used to be called
the APR/Iowa School sort before Jorie Graham and Bernstein etc formed
some kind of alliance, etc), and still have a hard time warming up to
it, but the prose form seemed less compromised (in a "temporary
absolute" sense). I now felt I could put the thing, the illusion of
the narrative self moving through time, out there, as a thing, and
worry about analyzing it, later. To me (if not to you, fine), there
was something strangely liberating in this, if not necessarily an
appeal to common humanity at least starting from a place of trying to
remember what I was like when 18 years old, and trying to look at
subsequent years of my life from that perspective, for better or
worse, or just different (which at the time HAD TO be better....).

Oh, sure, I could also say that if I had really thought about it at
the time, I would've considered that maybe my decision to publish
that piece (or at least give it to the editor, who could've said no,
and did, in fact, ask for some changes..) was a "nose thumbing"
gesture on my part, born out of a frustration to what I was feeling
as an overcommitment of my energies to the quasi-social subculture
that takes the idea of "poetry" (or more specifically of "being a
poet") as central to its being in the world. Or, as you put it, a
bemoaning. And at least a bemoaning is potentially more affirmative
than a "nose thumbing" gesture....

To bemoan a lack of influence, if that's indeed what I'm doing (and
that's the feeling you get from the piece, then you're right and I
can't argue with that with any authority), may be shoddy, or may even
be paradoxical (hypocritical), and certainly many poems transcend,
ignore, sublimate or self-censor such 'base' thoughts or feelings.
I've certainly done it....ALOT. But luckily there has been alot of
"legitimate" (even canonical) poetry that has celebrated the wide
gamut of bemoaning....So to say it has no place, well, you're
entitled to your opinion....

As for your question, the best answer would probably be the book from
which it is an excerpt. Not to cop-out on you, but yes the excerpt in
Young's book does end with the gesture of lament and bemoaning---but
that substance of that bemoaning is also a perception, a realization,
that it was time for a change (and so this excerpt is not as "self-
contained" as a poem may seem to be, because it's trying to whet the
appetite for the next chapter, which isn't included)-but also a
question, cold and analytical even, just what is the role of "mass
culture" in identity formation, and what implications does it have
for individuals, economic classes, or conceptions of labor in what's
often referred to, sometimes dubiously, as 'consumer society'

Apparently some people can simply change their lifestyle and/or
'mindset' (and the relationship between the two) as easily and
quickly as Cher changes costumes, but some other people need to
wrestle with it, verbalize it, write about it, and some other people
like reading about it (or memoirs and self-help books and such
wouldn't exist in such glut), and yeah maybe it's not my ultimate
genre-forte, and yeah maybe I made the mistake of placing it in the
wrong venue, like trying to push the envelope in terms of what's
permitted, but not primarily BECAUSE of some art-history mandate,
though it may have to be justified, and it can be okay to play that
game sometimes (though I also bemoan all the S**t  Alice Notley got
when Mysteries of Small Houses came out)---and if hey the self-
proclaimed poet-people didn't want to come with me into this, I can
be cool with that (though, yeah, the "self-discovery through self-
criticism" bag was part of what got me into poetry; as was the "if
you point the finger at someone else, you got 4 more pointing back at
you" trip...).

To her credit, Stephanie Young did. But whatever---I can see where
it's as out of place as I've been feeling more often than not in
primarily poet gatherings for years, and yeah perhaps I spent too
much time "bemoaning" that rather than just up and making a clean
break and reinventing myself and finding a new possibility of
community or like-minded people----But I think it's doing something
else too, speaking to other people, or at least realizing that
writing to other people (who may have no or little knowledge or
interest in the way poets talk or write to each other) really
involves no more social compromise than speaking or writing, to
poets, about, or 'in the form of,' what's called poetry does. "grace
to live as variously as possible," etc....

Is that a poetics? Is it something to keep at bay?
I have my silly social illusions and hopes too, and am fragile as
anybody,
but I still want to reach out, and love, be loved, still believe in
'each according to their abilities; each according to their needs"
and "by whatever means necessary" and that there can be mutually
transforming intensities that one build deep trust on,
and go beyond fatalism of the business-as-usual approach, and I'm
willing to stake what's 'left' of my life on it,
and that one's first baby-steps at 'bemoaning' can be socially pro-
active (especially in a social world that has
offered one a kind of 'conditional love' as long as one keeps writing
like one used to a decade earlier,
and it that's the case, I have to either try to change some people's
minds about that, or look elsewhere....
and, I guess that elsewhere can be here, or flarf or something...)

maybe....yes...

Chris

Holzer's texts problematize place - the semantics of place in relation to,
co-invasive with, the aphoristic. Just as the aphoristic marks a punctum
(in Barthes' sense of the word), so do the sites themselves.

Frankly, I think Holzer's one of the best 'writers' out there, but it's
all a matter of opinion. I've found them not only wonderful, but breath-
taking in their site-ing, sighting.

But there's another angle to the question above - how many poets read the
work of non-poets? I do multi-media performance obviously, and it's not
writers that show up - it's musicians, dancers, filmmakers, videomakers,
codeworkers, net people, artists, etc. etc. Poetry seems locked in an
enclave of genre and canon, for better or worse. Even on Poetics, I rarely
if ever see discussions of, say, mez, solipsis, noemata, Talan Memmott,
Kenji Siratori, Sandy Baldwin, Marjorie Luesebrink, etc. These names have
been around for a long time. There are poets of course who are interested
in these people, but most of them (the poets) also seem problematic.

I got tired of being told my work isn't "net art" or "epoetry" or "web
art" or "interactive art" or "new media" or "multimedia" whatever. Most of
this stuff comes from people who have a stake in definition - a greater
stake I think than in writing or performance/writing themselves - this is
true in particular for "epoetry" or "e-poetry" which is already at work at
ins and outs and canonizations.

In other words the problem for a lot of us isn't why aren't there more
non-poets at poetry readings - but instead - what constitutes poetry? What
constitutes a reading? etc. And at least in my experience which is
admittedly probably fucked, the answers lie in such narrowly-defined
categories that the field, if there is such, seems suffocating.

Is it a problem that only a small proportion of poetry readers don't also write it? I don't think so. Poetry should make poets of its readers, so if there were a great number of readers who didn't try to write it, that would be a problem. "Only a thousand people ever saw the Velvet Underground, but all of them went on to start bands," someone said. Likewise I can hazard that only a thousand people ever read The Tennis Court Oath (or whatever), but all of them went on to write poems. That's what we should want.

The screen burns my eyes out, so now I can see
  the true nature of in-itself, which is Mary
  and the kids flutter at the edges of their world.
  They have their mother in their pockets, in Iraq,

  where hungry Americans eat history. All told,
  code is obsessive with maps, even when girls
  grow into and out of unbounded crags. In fact,
  the kids soak up any drop of pressure they can,

  and Mary just hates herself most of the time. Back
  of the mouth and through a rough void, the shellac
  hardens, and kids grow into and out of their world.
  Even if I'm blind, I still drown, just like you.

  Movies run backwards, movies we unfurled.
  The film on my eyes is where we're all trapped.

The short answer is, "Yes, plenty of em."  But I also think the premise of the question is false.  It's the sort of question poets use to beat themselves up.  Oh, we're so inconsequential!  No one reads our work but us!  The truth is that the majority of poetry readers have ALWAYS been poetry writers.  Wouldn't almost anyone who loved reading poetry take a shot at writing a few poems themselves?

The difference is that now anyone who tries their hand at a bunch of poems is encouraged to think of themselves as a "professional" poet, even if they have some other full-time job, even if no one reads their work outside a very small circle who hold in common a tightly knit neighborhood of magazine and book publishers, if that.  And there are MFA's to be had and reviewers etc etc to create the necessary sense of institutional approval.  MFA's thrive, by and large, by convincing poets who in the past would have been "amateur" "neighborhood" poets to become "nationally recognized" "Prize-winning" poets.

This isn't necessarily a good or bad thing.  I mean, it's no doubt created some interesting communities and given some people an avenue out of a seriously bad and/or boring existence.  And obviously some very, very good poets have come up that way. But my point is: I bet my butt that there have always been a more or less equal percentage of "poetry readers" who *wrote poetry*, even if they didn't have the temerity in the past to identify themselves as "poets".

reading poetry isn't solely a matter of reading what is typically called =
poetry. poetry is the ghost in the machine. it also inflects work in =
other arts, media, and technologies like smoke in the air. hopefully it =

I'll wager that a good many denizens of MFA programs don't read any
poetry other than those produced in their workshops.  Can't ruin the
purity and originality of my "voice," don't you know.

Or a corollary: how many poets on the list don't read poetry in
languages other than English?

heidi, what exactly do you mean by "selling out"?

i think the concern that the only audience for poetry anymore (in the US) is
poets and our close relations/friends, is legitimate and quite frankly
pressing.

Jim,

This means you have specific ideas what poetry is beyond words. Could you
elaborate?

Welcome to Vanguardist Writers Network,

El escritor vanguardista busca en el arte algo que responda a
esa novedad interna que vive el hombre, apoyándose en el descubrimiento
original que uno lleva por dentro.

Juego constante de símbolos, necesidades que no se adaptan a formas
fijas, la negación a la versificación tradicional, son algunas de las
características que hacen a un vanguardista, ya que lo fundamental no
es lograr un sonido agradable, sino perseguir la libertad de expresión
adecuada a su mundo interior.

which poetry are you talking about?

Chax recently had a book signing for a local poet, Jefferson Carter, not
widely known away from here. We sold 60 books in almost 3 hours, and I
watched people sit down (it was in a lobby of a downtown hotel with a bar,
part of the time while a happy hour was going on) and read the book while
sipping martinis and the like. Some looked like they were reading it quite
seriously. Very few of them were poets. They were definitely friends of the
poet, and probably wouldn't go to a similar event for someone they didn't
know personally.

And today, a member of the state legislature of Arizona came in on another
matter (about the forced evictions in our warehouse and in other Tucson
warehouse art spaces). I had never met him before and didn't know he knew
anything about Chax Press. But almost upon entering, he said, "I want to
buy the book you published by Allison Cobb," and he did buy it, and seemed
very happy with that. Sure, he knew her as a college friend.

I mean, I can't think of a lot of people who read poetry constantly, as
poets do, who aren't poets. But I think I could probably, off the top of my
head, either name a few dozen people who occasionally read poetry who
aren't poets, and think of examples of more. Not always the poetry I might
like them to read, but so what?

This does not deny a shrinking audience (or one already shrunk, for a long
time now), but in some ways this thread hasn't made sense to me, because
I've always known non-poets who read poetry.

Not necessarily 'beyond words' but either not only words or words in
contexts that are atypical and worthy to be thought of as involving reading
poetry. Or if 'beyond words', then in intensest language
nonetheless--working through language in any number of ways that are 'beyond
words' but intensely involved with language. Lettristic work, for instance,
or sound poetry...

I read a paper today that Dan Waber posted a link to the other day: "From
Concrete to Digital: The Reconceptualisation of Poetic Space" (
http://tinyurl.com/y5n7e6 ), by Anna Katharina Schaffner. It occurred to me,
after reading it, that one of the useful things about concrete poetry was
its furthering of a flexible mentality concerning language. Intensest
engagement with language is ever shifting in its nature, locale,
technologies, contexts. Poetry needs to be flexible also to respond with
full humanity to the shifts in what is sayable and how it's sayable.
Expansive.

When there is a reality television series titled "Project Poetry" I will
start paying attention to this thread.

Poetry is not selling out to a mainstream audience near you anytime soon.

But hey, I can't sit here any think / write about poetry all day . . . I
have a life to live.

Taking a step back from the conversation here about "non poets who read
poetry" it can seem goofy.  Non poets who read poetry: poets.  But then
it's ascribed that poets are born. Then moreover you have certain
advanced readers (scholars and critics) at times offering the dumb,
lugubrious equivalent to "poets are still human."  So are astronauts,
and there aren't any non-astronauts doing space research in orbit.
Enough said, as they say.

I grew up in the rural midwest, but I did grow up on great fiction.  I
like the functional reality expressed by the novelist or photographer,
say, utterly graphed into the environment, opposing to that "ivory
tower" of poetry about whence all these types of conversations are
seriously entertained, resulting in some equally dumb, lugubrious
description of what makes poetry.  Those novelists and photographers are
slighted offhand, yet they are forcing us to reckon with them, while
poetry is "always-already" re-formulating itself as a community of
potential executives of an over-abstracted notion of ideal social
governance.  Most of it, as I can see, is concerned with "how poetry
should be," by it's already having been imputed to be that governance,
as an _ideal ultimate reality_/, /but doing what?  Didn't make the past
and won't make the future, because it wants no affidavit for Colluding
with Time.  A good novel requires more attention than a regular
collection of "good poetry," which doesn't say much.  An "ordinary"
person who doesn't read books (I know several myself, actually) can
comment a little and with elevated passion on what gives the required
reading some interesting or provoking element, and it requires /and/
inspires more effort than hearing and appreciating to hear a poem
recited for a moment of fleeting bliss, and pursuing it as work leads
immediately to the ultimate rhetorics of life and beauty, that gives the
leading poets an illusory panache of omniscience arriving from their
having grappled with those rhetorics to some arbitrary nuance.  Yes,
poetry is so full of life and beauty it burdens the scribe who's saying
"more than you know."

So what?  What else does it say?

And let me note my feeling of warm content in perpetuating along these
lines.  I think I'll take a break from scattering résumés on the
internet, and read some poetry.

this sounds like crazy talk to me -- who's making their fortune on
anything resembling the kind of work discussed here? and do we really
have a mole folding "fake" questions into the mix?

speaking for myself, in reading poetry it took me a long time to get
over the "I'll never be as good as _____" anxiety -- once I got over
this ego-tension aspect of any reading experience, it was a lot easier
for me to read others' work with an open mind and clarity.=20

which doesn't compromise one's voice, as I see it -- expands or deepens
it, if you pay close enough attention. if you think the purity of your
voice has been ruined, maybe it wasn't much of a voice to begin with?

unfortunately, I know several people who write poetry in the Twin
Cities, but who are too shy to read the work of others -- I think this
limits their perspective a whole damn lot.=20

This conversation seems odd and oddly entangled.
Poets write poetry. There are people who read poetry.
Some of them write poetry.
There are plenty of people who write poetry who do not read poetry.
Is the question of this thread really: Does anyone know any published poets
who don't read poetry. I'm assuming this wouldn't include self-published
poets, of course.

Whether someone who writes a certain kind of poetry will "approve of" the
poetry other's read is irrelevant and elitist. It also speaks to the heart
of that ever-present topic on poetry list servs: who gets to call themselves
a poet. I got a business card from a woman in Scotland who calls herself a
Poetry Practitioner because she thinks that's humble. I don't think it is-
it's an attempt to raise the bar and make being a POET something akin to a
spiritual calling or shamanistic role. And then holding that honor just
slightly above your own head and blushing slightly with eyes lowered
coquettishly.
_____
I read poetry in English and Norwegian. Those are the only two languages in
which I am fluent. I do read translations of very many other languages and
the various traditions are very interesting.
On another list serve people were whining about how in Iran and other
countries poets were treated like rock stars. The funny thing is, if these
same poets read the work of these Iranian poets, they'd condemn it as
populist and trite-

Such a simple question:  'does anyone know any non-poets who read =
poetry?'

For such complex answers (no need to thank me for not posting them =
here).=20

I prefer something akin to the following:
A.) Yes,  I know some non-poets who read poetry in both instances,=20
    Instance 1.
    1.)    In the instance of performers who read aloud the works of =
others, actors, for example, I know several such folks; they read, they =
perform, they don't necessarily write.
    Instance 2.=20
    2.)    In the instance of people who read the works of others for =
the pleasure of reading the works, as many do, and indeed as do I.   =
Yes, indeed, I've several acquaintances who enjoy reading poetry written =
by others, and who don't themselves write it, or at least don't =
acknowledge publicly they do.         =20

Also, I'm amused, amazed and only slightly befuddled by the complexity =
of the responses to such a simple question.=20

Reminds me somewhat of the Spam story about the 7 year old who asks his =
dad a Q about where he came from...remember it?  Dad responded with =
details of pre-familial relationships and wanders through details of =
early dating, wooing, foreplay, seduction, intercourse and finally =
conception prior to birth.=20

All of which resulted in the boy's saying, "Gee thanks, Dad, that's =
great; Sally says she came from Brooklyn."=20

I am not a poet; I write what I call poetry.  I read the poetry of =
others.  I also read prose, mostly history and current events news and =
commentary, and I am not an historian.  Further, I read the NY Times and =
the WA Post, daily (I don't read the weekend editions; too weighty with =
ads); I am not a journalist. =20

By the way, do any of you remember an early T.V. interview with Carl =
Sandburg...back in the late 50's or maybe early 60's...in any event, I =
seem to recall the interviewer calling him a poet to Sandburg's =
objection.  I can't begin to recall with sufficient accuracy to even =
paraphrase the response, but I vaguely remember his referring to himself =
as a chronicler of humanity...or words to that effect. =20

Any one else have any recollections of that interview? =20
Alex=20
 P.S. Gabe, why do you say the poetry at Whole (paycheck) Foods is "(not =
good)?"  Did you pay for one and were you disappointed after reading it? =
 Or were you reporting on the reactions of others who paid and were =
disappointed?  Did you actually read any of the works, or not? I'm just =
curious about the grounds upon which the evaluation comment were based.  =

some of my argument was idiosyncratic, but i feel that two of my points
are relevant..

1.  Poets are ascribed as born, deflecting potential readers.
2.  Poets are ascribed as more than human, deflecting potential readers.

then i have more idiosyncratic, small points..

poets ostensibly hold an urgent grievance or secret fait accompli, &
leverage interest in "finding out about that," but don't seem to provide
a reasonable climax compared to novels and movies

poetry in my experience is more an art that empties you first, then
attempts to fill you back up, and enough of it fails that reciprocation,
& in the newcomer to poetry the feeling is "lacking yet more," & that's
to say an impotent feeling, while a somewhat insufficient movie or novel
fills us up first, then works to empty, yet when these forms fail, the
average reader or viewer has the feeling of "having something" yet to
dispose of, & already at a pretty good clip, there's a feeling of
possibility.  granted those feelings are causing much delusion here &
now, and most of us are growing up on it.  even now i feel that i could
say more and better, but it's the left-over junk of poor drama, urging
me to repeat myself. i feel that i "have something," & the more i keep
at it, an element of delusion creeps in.

Hi, I was hoping someone might be willing and able to share Rusty Morrison's email with me. I was trying to track her down through Saint Mary's or Omnidawn, but found no email address specifically for her.

Thanks!

I guess I'm a bit confused by these comments, as, aside from Ren's,
the original query seems counter to "our moment" as some would say --
who is an avid movie fan who hasn't participated in making a movie /
especially arty home movie / filmlet on a digital camera / you tube
whatever?   Who has gone to a jillion open mike nights and had friends
in bands and hasn't written a song / sung back up / played the
triangle?  Who hasn't tried to write a comic or a story?  Who hasn't
ever been to or in a poetry slam?  Why read loads of poetry and not
put a hand in?

Jim,

You are responding, but indirectly, to the question I am asking. If we can
conceive of visual poetry, for example -not only of concrete or sound
poetry, but also of poetry which is the result of merging media in different
ways- then the connection of poetry strictly to words has to change. Of
course, such a change has numerous (endless?) consequences.

Ciao,

Murat

[apologies for any cross-posting]
Back in March 2006 kari edwards read over here in Baltimore at the i.e.
reading series. Fortunately enough (in hindsight), Justin Sirois
recorded the reading.

Over the past week he was able to dig up the source files and compress
them down to MP3s -- which we have up on Rock Heals this week with other
brief remembrances and a short tribute poem from Michael Ball.

http://www.rockheals.com

The audio is 23 minutes of kari reading from her last book, "obedience,"
so it's no short download (10.x MB!), but since there are so few
recordings of her available, we thought it was best to get it out there
for everyone. Download it and enjoy, today and tomorrow and the next day
and the next, etc.

They'll be there after this week, you'll just have to look in the
archives to find 'em.

Here is a related pair of pieces that do that, I think, Murat.

"Enigma n" (which is an anagram of 'meaning') is a 1998 piece at
http://vispo.com/animisms/enigman . This unfolds as a kind of application
with a menu. The period at the end tells you where the menu ends. You keep
clicking till you get to the end of the menu and have explored the menu
possibilities individually. This piece explores how the process of creating
and constructing meaning can change when a poem is a computer program that
is also involved in the visual and notions of interface. The terms of the
menu are usually verbs. Operations on language and the visual. For instance,
you can set the colors of the letters. But the piece itself then starts
changing the colors. You can view the source code of this piece by
right-clicking on the screen and choosing 'View source'.

"Enigma n^2" at http://vispo.com/animisms/enigman2 is a related but later
(2002) piece. Interactive audio/visual. In this piece, the word "meaning" is
represented not as letters but as audio and there's a visual waveform
representation of the audio. It graphs the audio's amplitude (volume). The
audio consists of the word "meaning" pronounced three times. Twice forwards,
once backwards. Clicking the waveform sets the audio's start point. You
cannot set the end point. The piece itself makes that decision. The 'text'
of this piece is the programming code, the engine, of the audio/visual
piece. The source code is downloadable.

Much of what is 'said' in both these pieces is conveyed through the
interactivity, not explicitly through written or even sonic language. You do
something and the piece reacts. Sometimes you can 'control' it as though it
were simply a 'tool'. In other cases, it's actions or reactions are not
wholly controllable. This hopefully turns into some sort of fucked up
'dialog' between the player and the piece. Whereas tools usually are
intended to shut up and simply do your bidding, be an extension of your body
or mind, etc.  There is some otherness to poetry and art, however, usually;
they rarely shut up and seek dialog.

There *is* written and sonic language here, and I think it plays a genuinely
significant role, but there are other forms of language/dialog going on
also.

I find that constantly reading poems by others helps me write my work.  I knew someone about ten years ago who claimed not to read poems by others for fear it might compromise her style.  She has since given up writing poetry altogether for writing songs.

this sounds like crazy talk to me -- who's making their fortune on
anything resembling the kind of work discussed here? and do we really
have a mole folding "fake" questions into the mix?

speaking for myself, in reading poetry it took me a long time to get
over the "I'll never be as good as _____" anxiety -- once I got over
this ego-tension aspect of any reading experience, it was a lot easier
for me to read others' work with an open mind and clarity.

which doesn't compromise one's voice, as I see it -- expands or deepens
it, if you pay close enough attention. if you think the purity of your
voice has been ruined, maybe it wasn't much of a voice to begin with?

unfortunately, I know several people who write poetry in the Twin
Cities, but who are too shy to read the work of others -- I think this
limits their perspective a whole damn lot.

I'll wager that a good many denizens of MFA programs don't read any
poetry other than those produced in their workshops. Can't ruin the
purity and originality of my "voice," don't you know.

Or a corollary: how many poets on the list don't read poetry in
languages other than English?

I dunno about self-indulgence, but I do know that what appears to be a lit
candle is a big no-no next to a computer and other electronic equipment,
to say nothing of all that paper. If it's scented, it's also a superb way
to kill your asthmatic officemate, although if you remain blissfully
untainted by evil academe, that's one of the things you ain't gotta worry
about.

Dear all --

I wanted to alert you to two issues of consequence. The first is that
absent magazine is now open for submissions; our issue is slated for 5
April 2007. Guidelines have changed, so please read them linked from our
homepage at:

http://absentmag.org/

The second is that rhubarb is susan, my poetry review blog, is again
active and with new content: a review of Nicholas Perrin, and one of Erica
Fiedler. Please check out their wonderful work and my commentary thereon.

Thank you very much for tuning in.

Yours,

Wonderful exchanges on the list - after, I wanna say,
a slow autumn, or is it fall. And now, winter. And me
no longer poopy. Wonder if this'll mean more civilians
will come to readings, that people without any
particular or specialized education will feel that not
only snotty folk read and write poems. I've always
viewed the poet as belonging to a necessary 'class' -
that Iike O'hara said of his, it should be "open,"
which is not always the case (regrettably). Some poems
and poets, not all, because I, too, often read poetry
while writing, sitting on the bus, taking a shit, but
I think, strip life out whatever words might be
offered, that they resonate with really no one - and
so thus do little work. Words are IMPORTANT things.
Orwell and Forster have talked about this engagingly,
for those who still read those fellas.- But I'm not
sure (and not up for any disagreements).

But for those are feeling cranky, and this is really
the main reason behind me post, I just came across
this, from the Vermont Country Store, and thought, me
in good cheer, the holidays coming, I'd offer:

Gift Idea No. 6, Tired Old AssSoak. The name promises
a good laugh for all who receive it, while this
revitalizing mineral bath is guaranteed to perk up the
user in a way that is no joke. Buy some today and give
folks on your gift list a reason to smile.

Best,
Alexander

A Very Brodey Christmas!

Have yourself a very Brodey Christmas! Celebrate any holiday with the poems
of Jim Brodey and music by Dear Old Stockholm Syndrome. Featuring readings
of Brodey's poems by Richard Hell, John Coletti, Lewis Warsh, Dustin
Williamson, Anselm Berrigan, Joel Lewis, Jacqueline Waters, Arlo Quint, Joh=
n
Mulrooney, Tom Savage, Rick Luanda, Stacy Szymaszek, Edmund Berrigan,
Corrine Fitzpatrick and heaven help us, maybe even more. Co-curated with Ji=
m
Behrle.  Read about Jim Brodey (1942-1993) here.

Richard Hell's most recent CD is the 2005 retrospective Spurts from
Warner/Rhino. His novel Godlike came out in 2005 too. He's at work on a boo=
k
of memories. John Coletti grew up in Santa Rosa, California and Portland,
Oregon before moving to New York City thirteen years ago. He is the author
of Physical Kind (Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs/Boku Books 2005), The New
Normalcy (BoogLit 2002), and Street Debris (Fell Swoop 2005), a
collaboration with poet Greg Fuchs with whom he also co-edits Open 24 Hours
Press.  Lewis Warsh's most recent books include The Origin of the World,
Touch of the Whip, Ted's Favorite Skirt and Debtor's Prison (in
collaboration with Julie Harrison). Two new chapbooks, The Flea Market in
Kiel and Flight Test, appeared in 2006. He is co-editor with Anne Waldman o=
f
The Angel Hair Anthology, editor and publisher of United Artists Books, and
Associate Professor in the English Department at Long Island University in
Brooklyn. A new novel, A Place in the Sun, is forthcoming in 2007. Dustin
Williamson  edits Rust Buckle and co-publishes Currency Press with Andrew
Mister. They have put out no books. Anselm Berrigan is still waiting for Ji=
m
Brodey to leave his apartment. Joel Lewis will bring Hannukah gelt in honor
of the fact that, event title aside, Jim Brodey was Jewish. Jim Behrle migh=
t
dress as Santa and is the author of She's My Best Friend (Pressed Wafer,
2006). O, won=B9t you join us?

I JACK-OFF ON THE GOVERNMENT!


I jacked-off on the government, last night, twisting
in dream-bed sheets of solid electricity lather.
Great dragon-faced monitors police my hospital corners,
aching to catch my feverous screams, squirming
out of my sweaty pores, on fire with chanting,
Squashed-down rabbis brandishing Phillips Screwdrivers
& bowing to no one but Lord Vishnu in human drag.
I call upon Heaven: Let down your veils, so I may climb up
the golden ponytail & vanish into your vapory realms!

Catherine Daly's new e-book/book PAPER CRAFT is now online at
http://www.moriapoetry.com/ebooks.html.



You can find a link there to buy a hard copy of the book or download the
free e-book.



Her second book this year, this book is a fascinating exploration into
language.


Just look at what others have said:



In the domain of the digital, Catherine Daly gives us paper; in an age of
speed, she gives us craft; in a moment of dematerialization, she gives us
concrete; in Southern California, she gives us snow.  Process is the key:
Daly wraps her fingers around words, privately sculpting them into
linguistic megaliths, only to later destroy them.  What remains, strewn
across these pages, is pure poetry.

Kenneth Goldsmith





I am awed by the capaciousness of Catherine Daly's language, or I should say
languages, and the dizzying array of forms like a series of birdcages in
which the door stands open, if the captive birds only knew it. Paper Craft
is a startling melange of fragmentary discourses, each of which intersects
with English to form a snapshot of the moment meaning happens.
Electromagnetism literalizes the "light" in enlightenment; an illustration
of "Decomposing Monzogranite" reveals the gradual erosion of a poetic
monument; modern and Middle English stand side by side and vie for the
reader's attention and sympathy. Daly insists on multiplying the available
dimensions for poetry: a five-pointed "rose" of words seems to revolve as we
read them, and actual patterns for folding and cutting paper literally
underwrite some of the poems. The gendered languages of science and
papercrafting meet in this new, frankly feminist dictionary, setting off
fireworks that illuminate as much as they dazzle.

Also, back then it was probably instilled as a "stock response" to that

Believing that nothing changes would be comforting, but you're wrong
on this one. Almost everyone has always wanted to be richer than they
are, but that wasn't why they went to college. Since then higher
education has become the passkey to more and more professions
(regardless of whether the skills learned there have any job
relevance), and schools of higher education have increasingly become
trade schools. I was there, then and now, but you needn't accept my
authority: this is hardly an original observation.

You can question the statistics/survey/what have you, but that's
pretty much my take on things.  As a teacher for the past 20 years or
so, I've seen the financial stakes raised considerably.  (On a
related note, we've all been sensitized, if that's the right word, to
the stock market, about which I knew zip 20 years ago.)  Now b/c I
was a college freshman in 1972, I'm clearly biased.  And b/c I was on
and off public assistance then, perhaps doubly so.

But I suspect the only way we develop a sense of such things follows
from such surveys *and* historical study of sociocultural trends
*and* anecdotal information.

Again, though, it squares with what I've experienced.  And I talk
with my classes about this stuff all the damn time, to get the
students' take on such things (which varies from campus to campus).
And as most of us who've looked into the matter know, this trend
seems to parallel the gradual privatization of the university (and
casualization of faculty labor).

Anyway, there's my anecdotal two bits' worth.

Best,

Joe

How is that "devolution"? In 1970, 79% of college freshmen were
apparently shmucks intoxicated on hippy-dippy bullshit. Now 75% of them've
got their feet on the ground and their priorities (roughly) in order. Behold
the grand march of progress.

Well -- not to drain your comment of its latent irony, but just b/c
one is more concerned about getting a job than living a meaningful
life doesn't mean one has got one's priorities straight.  My struggle
in the early 70s, aside from finding new ways to get shitfaced --
which is happening with at least as much abandon today -- was to find
a way to align "job" with "meaningful life."  Maybe I'm still
struggling with this.

But many of the young adults I teach today have nigh given up on half
of that equation, and seek "job" often w/o any sense that "meaningful
life" is potentially in the offing.

Or at least, that's my read of the situation.  And the situation is
generally much worse at the schools in the lower tiers, for the
obvious reasons.

Best,

Joe

Just as a "fear mentality" has been instilled in recent history- and the response is to focus on security over higher order needs, like developing meaningful philosophies of life. (need i mention maslow?) also, i wonder what the early-mid eighties preppies answered? perhaps we can take comfort in the cyclic nature of our obsessions?

"Voluntary Poverty" was a phrase ascribed to a whole chunk us in the sixties
and seventies - a high minded middle class option when it was actually still
possible to survive pretty well for less than 500 dollars a month. On less,
you could get food stamps, as well.
It was never thought of a free loading, but as a way to free up time for
creative and socially responsible work. Any number of us in the poetry
world, for example, who were supporting small presses, public readings (and
simultaneously averse to going to graduate school) were out there on this
edge (with the usual few good souls transferring their trust funds into
writing and publishing operations).
The fluke was the Vietnam war  created both a generous economy - including
generous social programs -  while fueling rebellion and progressive causes
(including writing).

By the time real estate interests began to make housing way too expensive
for artists in the cities, and artists/writers began to have kids, etc., the
game was up. Financial well being was a score that had to be faced, as well.
I won't even go into the rising costs of college and the subsequent slavery
of so many to paying off government college loans - which must be like duct
tape across the mouth of rebellious instincts. Right now my daughter - in
her last year of a Clinical Psych Doctorate is being woo'ed by the Air Force
to join in exchange for relief of a 100K in loans.  Lots of post traumatic
stress folks need to be treated on the relative cheap of her services. Deals
with the Devil, I say! Of course I feel guilty for not having gotten my PhD
in Computer Sciences, earning a fortune and putting through grad school.
(Fortunately the UC system in California is still relatively a good deal re
costs and a 'good' education).

 (Fanny Howe's autobiographical essay in The Wedding Dress (right title?) on
surviving in the sixties through government programs is a very good portrait
on the downside of scamming the system as a way to survive while raising
family and doing progressive work.)

I think Idealism ran high in those days. Some people were ready to face
misery in order to answer questions they considered important.
I don't know if Heidi Arnold is right. From what I know there are all sorts
of beings among my students, some years are better than others, but I have
my doubts that such idealism has had a chance to repeat itself.

Best wishes,
Anny Ballardini

hello, I've been a patient reader of the listserv for about half a year, and
feel now would be a good moment to throw my hat into the discussion:
I graduated from SUNY-Albany in May 2006. Yes, we want to be financially
"well off," however that doesn't mean that we are abandoning any
intellectual pursuits or sacrificing a "meaningful philosophy of life" for
whatever a well off income would constitute.
No (as heidi arnold states) we are not so different.

Class of `72, you had a good run, but if my generation is enjoying the
fruits of your philosophical labor, then something smells.

best wishes and happy holidays

Rather than defensiveness, try this: I'm willing to bet that the
degree to which universities are seen as job training first and
pursuit of knowledge second is directly proportional to the
percentage of the population attending college, which probably tracks
pretty well with the decline in the quality of high school educations
and the increasing requirement of a college degree to get in the door
for a job interview. Although universities have, many of them, fought
a rear-guard action (probably moreso in the first tier
institutions),  they have responded to consumer demand by adding more
vocational training and dropping general education requirements so
that students can jump into majors they consider relevant more quickly.

This didn't start in the 70s, of course--it's been in process since
the massive expansion of universities after WWII. But I think there
was a tipping-point around 1970. My professors back then would have
been shocked to hear a student own up to being there primarily to get
a good job.

I taught my first college course in 1968, by the way.

--  well, in a freshman writing class there's some sort of transaction
between the institution and the kids going on -- required course -- that
everyone pays lip service to -- and also this track from high school to
degree to job -- sure, that everyone pays lip service to -- i just don't
believe that's the sum total of a student's intellectual capacity -- in any
case -- it's more like the crust on a snowbank

-- at the same time i quit teaching so this institutional vice grip on kids
may be having some effect -- tho not i would say in terms of what they are
capable of or what they would most like to do with their intellectual lives
-- by which i mean this intellectual apathy or whatever it's called is not
the kids' problem -- it's located elsewhere

let's see, if you were 22 in 1979, that would mean you were born in 1957 and were forty nine years old this year.

based on the forty five to fifty five year olds I know, I'd guess there were a lot of people who had to revise those goals downwards as time wore on. Maybe kids today are just not as full of themselves...

I think that's an interesting observation, Joe. For me, and I've been out of that age group for only about five or six years now, it was never a question that i would be able to find meaningful fulfilling work. I always assumed that was an impossibility, and once I entered the workforce after college, the reality that the sorts of opportunities that existed 20 years ago for college educated young people just aren't there anymore really hit home. What I was forced to deal with was finding a way to create meaning and satisfaction in my life outside of what I do to earn a living. It's been a tough road, but now as I'm just a year shy of thirty, I have to say it's worked out pretty well for me. Rather than trying to find work that i loved, I looked for work that I could tolerate and do well. it's lead to me getting paid pretty well and has given me opportunities to travel and live my life the
way I want to without really interfering with who I am as a person or what I do in my life to find contentment. Because I didn't need my work to define my level of satisfaction with my life, it's less important to me and really all I have to worry about is whether I like the people I'm working with and whether I feel like I'm paid what I'm worth. If the people in the survey were anything like me, I'd guess that they probably felt like they had that whole meaning thing to themselves and weren't really looking to get that out of their college experience. What they were looking for were the skills, knowledge, and experiences to allow them to have what people with bachelors degrees are generally capable of that non-college educated people have less of: being flexible and keep their options and minds open to whatever possibilities present themselves, but even moreso taking some time post adolescence
to get to know themselves and their desires and ambitions without the pressures of teh workplace. I think that both of those things have value and are worthy of higher eduction. The last thing we need is to add to the glut of overeducated underemployed post-docs patiently waiting for tenured baby-boomers to kick the bucket or retire so they can get on with their careers.

In 1970 the US had an economy that offered many more good jobs for many morepeople- we could afford to be idealistic we had just come out of the New Deal and our incomes were pretty evenly distributed (see Paul Krugman). This level of justice no longer exists in America and it colors everything.

 Today we live in a world where people with good educations live much more edgy lives and where many educated are on edge.

Here are some other stats;  in 1970 the birth of a child cost $875.00 today it costs $22,000.
A college education in 1970 cost on average $850 a year today it averages over $5,000 for in state tuition

In 1970 the average wage for a GM (GM was the largest Employer then) worker was the national average in 2006 the average worker for Wal Mart today's leading employer is $18,000.

A PBS special on today's workforce sd there are now 4 generations in it
(many older people can't afford to retire) and the people in their 20's have
a dif idea than previous generations abt what work is--at least those who
are technologically well educated do, which I realize leaves a lot of people
out. Anyway they expect to work very hard for short periods then get a lot
of vacation, to be challenged at work & be treated as equals, to work
communally rather than alone, to be judged on their product not how they are
in the workplace bec they can be anywhere now & work, & they multi-task much
better than previous generations yet can focus better than previous
generations, demand extremely high salaries, expect to have 2 careers in
their lives, expect flexibility for parents, quit if they aren't challenged
intellectually. Of course working class kids may not have any of these
opportunities, esp in a free market world w/out brakes.

Jesse Crockett's comments regarding philosophy reminded me
of an aphorism (#654) by Vauvenarges, Luc De Clapiers, Marquis of
Vauvenarges (1715-1747) that I came across recently: " A philosopher is
either a frigid personality or a humbug; he should therefore make but
momentary appearances in a poem, because that ought to
be a faithful and feeling portrayal of human nature."

("Un philosophe est un personnage froid ou un personnage menteur;
il ne doit donc figurer qu'on moment dans un poeme, qui
doit etre un tableau vrai et passionne de la nature."
[there are, of course, accents over the e's on po(e)me, (e)tre and
passionn(e)]

I can't help mentioning that I don't particularly agree with either
Vauvenarges' or Crockett's comments on this, but I enjoyed both
in the way I completely enjoy the tart, but frequently misguided maxims of
E. M. Cioran.

By this logic, we should reject everything that's good about
human life (not just philosophy and art, but also eating well/
enough, living w/o constant fear of starvation, disease, and
abandonment, and so on), insofar as it's denied to a large
number of people.

Seems to me that making things available to more people is
the solution, not rejecting those things. If something is
ESSENTIALLY based on privilege, maybe it does need to be
thrown out. There's nothing essential about philosophy
that connects it to privilege; it's just that it, like
the other things listed above, has been denied to most
people thus far--and THAT's what has to change.

And it's time to give up this blurry idea of "exclusiveness."
Distinguish between phenomena whose existence negates what
ain't them and those what don't. Again, philosophy doesn't
keep anybody out; nor does the existence of li'l groups of
people who engage in or discuss philosophy do anything to
destroy other people (just as "avant-garde" poetry doesn't
destroy slam poetry).

It's so, so easy to criticize any project based on care and
dedication; cynicism is a nigh-invulnerable, and totally
boring, critical position.

But the idea of a "meaningful philosophy of life" is pretty
stupid in practice, allied more with that "cha-ching" Jesse
mentions than with what I'd call philosophy.

cheers,

AMG

Considering white collar workers to be working class seems a crucial part of the shift that is being discussed. We would have never considered those terms as co-mingling 2 decades ago.

After three months of posting two to four blog entries every week, I took a
3-week vacation from blogging. Not that it was a plan, rather, other things
just took over, some of which are represented on the blog, particularly
issues surrounding our Chax Press warehouse studios. But tonight I posted
on the blog again, with four new entries. To catch up on the warehouse
issues, make sure to scroll down to see the first posted of those four.

I'm with you here, until I get to your point that

In everyday life, it seems to me, there is little distinction to be made
between what is termed "philosophy", "philosophy of life" or even
"psychology" or "psychoanalysis" in formal (academic or professional)
thought or activity and the type of introspection that occurs, moment to
moment, within most people's minds continuously. It seems to me that
introspection and insight are not only the province of the privileged, but
that such efforts go on more or less continuously within nearly everyone's
mind, particularly when they are conversing with other people, or observing
other people talk about or do things, critically or thoughtfully. Which
brings to mind the idea that "The mass of men lead lives of quiet
desperation."Of course it is obvious that such desperation frequently drives
people to act blindly, manipulatively, ruthlessly, rather than attempt to
understand life's dilemmas further in a philosophical way. The issue is,
whether a person is well provided for or not, their level of anxiety and
empath will usually determine the practical effectiveness of their attempts
at introspection and insight. Introspective insight plus empathy affords the
opportunity to  accurately understand what other people are saying and
doing.  A person with psychological well being (contained anxiety plus
developed empathy) ordinarily philosophizes quite effectively, whether such
philosophical understanding is articulated or not and such understanding
will ordinarily progress towards ever more complex understanding throughout
their lives. Yet, of course, when the issue of social or cultural change
emerges, moral courage is another crucial factor...

For another context, I once wrote that "I don't see poetry and philosophy as
separate activities.  They both proceed from similar questions: What can I
know? What can I do? Who am I?  Who are you?  What can you do?  Can we make
something together? " Pretty fundamental onto-epistemology--one's just trying to
situate oneself on the planet.  Nothing particularly elitist there to my way of
thinking.

The  aura of "elitism"  in re: poetry, philosophy, etc, is a side effect of
the professionalization of these disciplines--there are those who have the
approval of a prestige conferring institution and those who don't--which, in the
historical scheme of things, is a pretty recent development.

Jason, thanks for your thoughts...

This thread has meandered a bit from where I was hoping it might go.
I learned last night that Joel's NY Times snippet was itself culled
from the 2007 Statistical Abstract of the United States (CBS offered
the same snippet).

My read on same has little to do (Heidi) with what you find when you
scratch & sniff.  I.e., I don't see it as an ontological (or
anthropological) assertion, though I would observe that the category
of "student" is at stake here, which suggests (to me, anyway)  that
the category of "teacher" is likewise at stake.  And I don't see it
as accusatory -- I don't "blame" students for being of a different
mindset today than three or four decades ago.  Frankly, I'd be
shocked if they weren't!  The issue isn't whether, when you prod
someone, you find that they're receptive to the idea of discussing a
meaningful life (or whatever).  I've always found this to be the case
myself -- in fact most students appreciate the prodding, though some
come better prepared to respond to same.  The issue has more to do
with how often our social and cultural conditions give people,
students in particular, pause to think about same, and ultimately, to
act on same.  And give teachers occasion to so prod.  I can't tell
you how many students ("my students") tell ME that they don't feel
they have any room to move in this regard.  And I can't tell you how
many teachers -- in a sort of vicious circle -- articulate despair
when talking about their students' aspirations or lack thereof (mea
culpa).  Again, such "feelings" are more pronounced the lower you go
in the academic food chain.  Or such is my experience.

And this is, in part, b/c the economic conditions have become far
more volatile, and certainly b/c we're all -- all of us --  more
attuned to same (by which I mean to include the pervasive bottom-line
rhetorics that have seeped into our institutions and into our lives).
But I wouldn't want to argue from the economic premise alone -- there
are certainly other factors, on the cultural side of things, that
have conspired to undermine (as I see it) the idea that "all men by
nature desire to know" (Aristotle).  I mean, the latter may still be
the case (call me an optimist), but the more pressing question is how
congenial our institutions are to such an assertion.

At any rate, it's clearly the case that the professoriate has
undergone a sea change too in the intervening years.  A simple
demographic analysis will reveal as much, albeit I'd probably want to
argue that the forces of professionalization often overdetermine
postsecondary behavior, regardless of demographics.

So a change in attitudes IS hard to get a handle on, but I don't
think we can wish away that statistical variation.  It says
something, at the very least, as to how students have learned to
articulate themselves, and this says something, at the very least,
about induced attitudes.  Which says something about --

Best,

Joe

A somewhat different perspective on one kind of "philosophy of life"
by a few folks in "my generation" is offered in a review I wrote of
*Sing a Battle Song: Poems by Women in the Weather Underground
Organization*, which was originally published in 1975 and just
reissued by Factory School. The review had just appeared in the
December/January issue of the Brooklyn Rail and is on their web site
but also posted at:
http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/blog/#12-15-06

Personally, I found many of my classmates of the late 60s/early 70s a
troubling group who would not hold up well in terms of many of the
values usually attributed to the "60s," or in terms of the ethical
and political values of many of today's undergraduates. But then I am
prone to be troubled. Conversely, I spend a good deal of time with
undergraduates and find many of them seriously confronting the issues
they face, not only as best they can but also admirably.  I prefer,
that is, to think anecdotally and critically, and in terms of
socio-historical context, rather in terms of massed mediated
lifestyle "trends," which in terms of "the 60s" was mostly (and
continues to be) disinformation and for the current generation is a
form of institutionally fomented despair and pacification.

Vintage photo of dead horse raises questions

By Janet Ortegon
Sheboygan Press staff

view photo at:
http://www.sheboygan-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061215/
SHE0101/612150642/1973

First of all, what's the deal with the top hat?

A vintage Sheboygan photo, taken before the turn of the 20th century,
has sparked some conversation in the community since its inclusion in
The Sheboygan Press' 2007 calendar.

The photo, which is inside the calendar's front cover, shows a scene
at Eighth Street and Indiana Avenue, looking north toward the Eighth
Street bridge.

In the photo, a dead horse lies in the street, roped off with string
tied to stakes in the dirt road. A man in a top hat, bow tie and
jacket sits on top of the horse, and people in the background are
standing still, looking toward the camera.

"I always just assumed it was taken as a joke or something like
that," said Bill Wangemann, Sheboygan city historian. "I was never
able to find out anything about it. What the story behind that
(picture) is, I don't have the foggiest notion."

Past attempts by reporters at The Sheboygan Press to find out the
circumstances of the photo were unsuccessful, and even local experts
at the Sheboygan County Historical Research Center came up empty-
handed when they looked for information.

A print of the photo was submitted to the Historical Research Center
several years ago, said Kathy Jeske, but there was very little
information attached.

"I don't think we have any idea," Jeske said. "There's no name on it,
nothing."

The photo does say, on the back, that it was taken at Eighth Street
and Indiana Avenue, and that it's of a man sitting on a dead horse.

That last part might be redundant, but the photo clearly shows the
entry to the Eighth Street Bridge and what is probably the Evergreen
City Hotel and Saloon on the northeast corner of the intersection,
near where the C. Reiss Coal building is now.

In the background is a brick and lime business and other unidentified
buildings on the banks of the Sheboygan River.

Wangemann said he guesses the photo was taken between 1890 and 1900,
judging by how the men are dressed and the dirt street.

Roger Prescher, 73, owner of the Charcoal Inn South, liked the photo
so much he hung a framed copy in his restaurant several years ago,
along with other photos of historic Sheboygan.

"We just wanted a little nostalgia," Prescher said. "I think it's
kind of funny."

If anyone knows anything about the origin of the photo or has
information about the scene, contact Janet Ortegon at 453-5121 or
jortegon@sheboygan-press.com.

The value of statistics, used with caution, is that they act as a
corrective to the anecdotal, which usually contains unexamined
variables. Like that the students who hang out with professors may
have different interests than the ones who don't.

OK, a cautious use of some statistics. The raw statement of
self-proclaimed goals then and now doesn't speak to value, but it
does speak to change, and it happened in a context which can be
differently selected. Here's another way to do it. Let's say for the
moment that the reason that many attend college really has changed,
and not just in one 35 year period. I found a neat table of extent of
education arranged by age groups going back to 1940. For simplicity,
I'll restrict myself to just the 25 and under group. In 1940, when
the population was 142 million, 7,500,000 in that age group had gone
to at least one year of college. In 1970, when the population was
213,200,000, the number was 23,200,000. In 2005, when the US
population was 300 million, the number was 100,400,000. Let's assume
that the numbers of older students was roughly proportional, except
in the immediate aftermaths of WWII and Korea, when many whose
educations had been deferred and were now eligible for the GI Bill,
went to school. The GI Bill is no more, and all students or their
families pay a vastly larger proportion of their likely lifetime
earnings for an eduction.

OK, that's quite an uptick in the percentages going to college. The
question is whether 100,000,000 US kids are passionate about the life
of the mind or factors other than sheer love of learning have played a part.

A few things to throw into the hopper. Before WWII elite colleges
were non-competitive--if you had the right name and the money you got
in. A BA or BS wasn't necessary for most forms of employment. There
were a great many jobs in skilled trades and manufacturing that could
generate the income to support a family. Even in many of the learned
professions, like engineering, medicine and law, most students went
straight from High School to professional school. This is still the
case in most of the world, and in business and technical schools as
well. And advance up the corporate ladder also didn't require a
college degree and in most cases was limited at the very top more by
family name than education.

Higher education, at least until the thirties, was the prerogative of
a class with a fair amount of leisure, for whom education was a
social marker. And I imagine that everyone on the list is aware of
how limited the pool of successful applicants could be at the most
prestigious colleges (and for blacks at almost all colleges).

Of course, in the thirties and forties a relatively small percentage
of students finished high school. But for those who did a high school
education could be a sufficient start.

Now (and this was beginning to be apparent in the 60s) one can't
assume that even literacy comes with a high school diploma, and the
jobs once available to those without a college degree are either in
other countries or require as an entrance to the interview room a
college diploma, even if the job requires few skills learned in
college. It shouldn't surprise anyone that the number of students who
try to get through the four years as painlessly as possible has gone up.

The trend to more and more education tenuously related to career
performance (but increasingly costly nonetheless) proceeds apace.
Many on this list will probably be among the last to get tenure with
an MFA as the PhD in creative writing becomes mopre widespread.

My own feeling, based among other things on therapeutic work wiith a
lot of college kids and their families (a different set of anecdotal
data), is that as a society we're doing something pretty awful to
those of the young who are just putting in time and really only
tolerate college because of amenities like health clubs, long
vacations, and parties, the excesses of which are I think linked to
boredom and frustration. And it's not so nice that their payment for
the ticket at the gate leaves them financially crippled.

Of course, if any of this were changed there would be a rather nasty
economic collapse, and the putative careers of a lot of list members
would go up in smoke.

I'm no philosopher, but I think the compounding specialization of the
"upwardly mobile" career path leads us to gear for being an expert in
one facet of a large specialization.  I'm pursuing a B.S. degree in
computer science, and there are myriad specialties, many of them
requiring one to reinvent one's core skills every three years.  Fifty
years ago how many kinds of nurses and doctors were there?  Now there's
probably a hundred or more professional "titles" for nurses and
doctors.  Compared to fifty years ago, a college grad could expect to be
financially well off, and have the luxury of pondering a greater
personal significance in the big picture.  Now it's an insult to ask a
nurse practitioner or physician's assistant, or software engineer, for
her or his philosophy of life.  It's an insult !

Here's an excerpt from Rose Window or, Prosettes by Wanda Phipps:

Everyone suddenly blue, a dark effervescent blue as if covered with
body paint -- dressed for carnival. But somehow it was caused by a
shift in the lighting -- suddenly everyone resembled barking blue
dogs. We began describing ourselves to each other. He said I was all
blue except for a spot of red at the center of my lips -- a deep red
spot as deep as the blue that covered the rest of my body.

I felt cold. His hands touched me, his body pressed against me and I
felt a vague sensation of pressure at different points on my body as
if I were being caressed through layers and layers of wool. He was a
slight breeze sending faint ripples across the surface of a lake. I
could hear him breathing.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

I pretty much agree with you, Nick.

I was really thinking, not of the actual and ongoing posing of
these (indeed, properly philosophical) questions in one's life,
but of the situation in which someone asks, "So, what's
your philosophy of life?". You're supposed to give a nice
little answer, like "Work hard, play hard," or maybe
something a little longer ("Everything is connected, and
the best thing anybody can do is to discover their role
in that web"). The idea that one has an answer to this
question implies that the philosophizing is pretty much
over and done with--that it's been boiled down to a succinct,
guiding mantric statement. Doubt is dealt with
in advance. The idea that the questions have been answered--
that there are no more doubts, and that
a concise and complete "philosophy" could take care of any
question aside from "practical" ones, and do so for the
forseeable future--seems like the opposite of philosophy,
in either its specialized or its everyday sense.

(Of course, there are some "professional philosophers,"
particularly in the U.S., who see philosophy in a similar
light--not as an everyday guidepost, in this case, but as
a way to settle, once and for all, the theoretical part
of science (and of ethics, religion, art, etc.), to liberate
the latter from reflection so it can get on with the work
of, say, developing AI systems for the military).

>> stupid in practice,

In everyday life, it seems to me, there is little distinction to be
made
between what is termed "philosophy", "philosophy of life" or even
"psychology" or "psychoanalysis" in formal (academic or professional)
thought or activity and the type of introspection that occurs, moment
to
moment, within most people's minds continuously. It seems to me that
introspection and insight are not only the province of the privileged,
but
that such efforts go on more or less continuously within nearly
everyone's
mind, particularly when they are conversing with other people, or
observing
other people talk about or do things, critically or thoughtfully. Which
brings to mind the idea that "The mass of men lead lives of quiet
desperation."Of course it is obvious that such desperation frequently
drives
people to act blindly, manipulatively, ruthlessly, rather than attempt
to
understand life's dilemmas further in a philosophical way. The issue
is,
whether a person is well provided for or not, their level of anxiety
and
empath will usually determine the practical effectiveness of their
attempts
at introspection and insight. Introspective insight plus empathy
affords the
opportunity to  accurately understand what other people are saying and
doing.  A person with psychological well being (contained anxiety plus
developed empathy) ordinarily philosophizes quite effectively, whether
such
philosophical understanding is articulated or not and such
understanding
will ordinarily progress towards ever more complex understanding
throughout
their lives. Yet, of course, when the issue of social or cultural
change
emerges, moral courage is another crucial factor...

MY PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE


Just when I thought there wasn't room enough
for another thought in my head, I had this great idea--
call it a philosophy of life, if you will.  Briefly,
it involved living the way philosophers live,
according to a set of principles. OK, but which ones?

That was the hardest part, I admit, but I had a
kind of dark foreknowledge of what it would be like.
Everything, from eating watermelon or going to the bathroom
or just standing on a subway platform, lost in thought
for a few minutes, or worrying about rain forests,
would be affected, or more precisely, inflected
by my new attitude.  I wouldn't be preachy,
or worry about children and old people, except
in the general way prescribed by our clockwork universe.
Instead I'd sort of let things be what they are
while injecting them with the serum of the new moral climate
I thought I'd stumbled into, as a stranger
accidentally presses against a panel and a bookcase slides back,
revealing a winding staircase with greenish light
somewhere down below, and he automatically steps inside
and the bookcase slides shut, as is customary on such occasions.
At once a fragrance overwhelms him--not saffron, not lavender,
but something in between.  He thinks of cushions, like the one
his uncle's Boston bull terrier used to lie on watching him
quizzically, pointed ear-tips folded over. And then the great rush
is on.  Not a single idea emerges from it.  It's enough
to disgust you with thought.  But then you remember something William James
wrote in some book of his you never read--it was fine, it had the fineness,
the powder of life dusted over it, by chance, of course, yet still looking
for evidence of fingerprints. Someone had handled it
even before he formulated it, though the thought was his and his alone.

It's fine, in summer, to visit the seashore.
There are lots of little trips to be made.
A grove of fledgling aspens welcomes the traveler.  Nearby
are the public toilets where weary pilgrims have carved
their names and addresses, and perhaps messages as well,
messages to the world, as they sat
and thought about what they'd do after using the toilet
and washing their hands at the sink, prior to stepping out
into the open again.  Had they been coaxed in by principles,
and were their words philosophy, of however crude a sort?
I confess I can move no farther along this train of thought--
something's blocking it.  Something I'm
not big enough to see over.  Or maybe I'm frankly scared.
What was the matter with how I acted before?
But maybe I can come up with a compromise--I'll let
things be what they are, sort of.  In the autumn I'll put up jellies
and preserves, against the winter cold and futility,
and that will be a human thing, and intelligent as well.
I won't be embarrassed by my friends' dumb remarks,
or even my own, though admittedly that's the hardest part,
as when you are in a crowded theater and something you say
riles the spectator in front of you, who doesn't even like the idea
of two people near him talking together. Well he's
got to be flushed out so the hunters can have a crack at him--
this thing works both ways, you know. You can't always
be worrying about others and keeping track of yourself
at the same time.  That would be abusive, and about as much fun
as attending the wedding of two people you don't know.
Still, there's a lot of fun to be had in the gaps between ideas.
That's what they're made for!  Now I want you to go out there
and enjoy yourself, and yes, enjoy your philosophy of life, too.
They don't come along every day. Look out!  There's a big one...

Haven't heard anything about the prospect of an "alternative" reading for "experimental" poets. I thought this was a yearly tradition, and surely Philly isn't so lame as to drop the ball on it (nudge, nudge)?

The hardest part is finding the venue. In New Orleans, we found a church to donate their pews for two consecutive nights for whatever amount of money we were able to raise in donations from the readers-audience. After that, send out the email calling for participants, compile a list, and show up.

Someone said that there wasn't a free night? Both Thursday and Friday are free (other than a panel on Goethe on Thursday; life is a series of difficult choices, you can't please everyone, yadda yadda). You could hold it from 9 or 9:30 to 11 or so on both nights and there would be plenty of room for everyone. As long as the venue is large enough, people can come and go as they please, so no one's trapped the whole time. You can do it, Philly, I know you can--it'll be fun!

    Michael,

      I'd be happy to put something together if I can get  "yesses" from a good number of poets. I thnk it would be a blast, a  welcome break from MLA-ness.

A fine reference in the context of this thread. I get the drift, but I am
also reminded of another Ashbery, the Ashbery of *Three Poems.* At the time
(1972) the book came as a breathtaking contrast to the Ashbery of *The
Tennis Court Oath*,  a book more along the lines of Rilke's *Letters to a
Young Poet* than the work of Jackson Pollack or Gertrude Stein. I thought of
it then as perfection, after *The TC Oath* especially, which I worshipped,
and that now I would never be able to free myself from his spell, an
influence that I had earnestly believed up to then I could completely enjoy
but still shake off the way a drenched dog shakes off the snow. I couldn't
find a way, so I just read it over and over searching for a flaw. On
something like the eighth reading I decided the tone of the book reminded me
of a kindly sermon by some mythical Methodist minister and let it go at
that.

But, no surprise, a few lines have always remained with me.  I had forgotten
they were from *Three Poems*:

"The great careers are like that: a slow burst that narrows to a final
release, pointed but not acute, a life of suffering redeemed and annihilated
at the end, and for what? For a casual moment of knowing that is here one
minute and gone the next, almost before you were aware of it? Whole tribes
of seekers of phenomena who mattered very much to themselves have gone up in
smoke in the space of a few seconds, with less fuss than a shooting star. Is
it then that our bodies combined in such a way as to show others that we
really mean it to each other- is this really all we ever intended to do?
Having been born with knowledge or at least with the capacity to judge, to
spend all our time working toward a way of showing off that knowledge, so as
to be able to return to it at the end for what it is? Besides the obvious
question of who knows whether it will still be there, there is the even more
urgent one of whose life we are taking into our hands? Is there no other way
in which these things may be done for themselves, so that others may enjoy
them?..."

so I haven't found a publisher for this thing  yet but i'm hoping that
the editor of this fine journal of experimental prose: Sidebrow
(www.sidebrow.net) will eventually help out either with advice or his
very expert organizational and layout and editing--and in the meantime
i'm sort of collecting any collaborations that come.

The idea is that there would be a book that does almost nothing but
talk back to the reader(s) and make one/them aware of the materiality
of the book as one reads. In some ways it is a sort of communist
invective but it doesn't have to be just that.  It's also weirdly a
love story (with multiple lovers because that's how books are--highly
communist) because of a problem about reading in which you can never
quite clearly see the thing read.

Eventually to make the most sense it would have to be a physical book,
but I think that there could be some exciting internet collaboration
in which other commodities speak to their buyers, as they already do:
"Eat me, buyer. Just bite me, okay" Advertisements, you know, as the
book's punk/slut side. Or other things along the lines of
Marguerite's: "I am not a pipe.  I don't know why everyone always
calls me a pipe." Maybe you can see the dorky language philosophy
here=85

And also the part that is being a book could have some marginalia that
is perhaps a way for the reader to talk back herself. (I'm thinking of
Nabokov's Pale Fire in some way about this). "No! see Hegel. Aww." Or
some kind of other comments that tell a whole story of what I imagine
is a very different text that "the imagined reader" probably receives.

Does that make any sense? Maybe not, but below attached are some samples.

***

I assume you are reading this, reader. I assume you are holding
me--touching me in some way with your hands. But perhaps I have given
up on closing to you, reader. Perhaps I am willing to be read from
some distance away, laid down the table next to your breakfast bowl,
propped up on the milk. If you were more sophisticated you would have
bought a bookstand, but you won't do that reader, although that would
free your hands up for some good rocks.  I'd sit inside of the
bookstand, stretched completely open and stare back at you if you'd
only learn how to throw rocks.

*** [new page]

Maybe you wanted it to be a pretzel bag that you were opening, reader.
I can't even tell you how to defrost the fridge? But I know that it
doesn't close anymore, reader=97that's how full of ice things have got
in this world. The freezer door won't close and then the big door
won't close. Have we got any kind of future, reader? The milk has gone
bad and I found a dead ladybug in the greenbeans, which are breathing
too heavily into their little bags. Maybe you'll tell me what's wrong
before I put a pan of hot water in there. Should I fly away home,
reader? Fly and get home.

***[some distance away]
What is it like to have no time to read, reader? Is it your uncle's
birthday again?  What about the PTA calling tree? Pretty soon your
ex-wife's going to tell you to drive 70 miles an hour, rushing across
three high toll bridges in that shit oil-and-gas-hog  mini-van that
you bought when you tried and failed to buy a whole  house. A whole
life, reader=97that's what you want, eh=97just a little job and a family
and house.  You'll kill yourself one of these days driving too fast
across the Yukatan landmass just so you can see that school play where
your son's got the part of a palm tree. Your ex-wife didn't even sew
his costume, reader. She, meaning you paid for someone else to do it
because your wife's gotten so hoity, she's forgotten how to sew.
     She wouldn't have been able to forget if she was still with you,
reader. Think about those ten years you two ruined your hands sanding
dry rot off the back porch of that run-down imitation Victorian that
that we all knew you'd never be able to buy. What on your salary,
reader? I don't care how many times your wife re-wrote the bills. The
American dream was never real, reader. There isn't any way for you to
get to it no matter how fast you drive. Even after you've paid for
your son's costume, do you think you'll get to take your little boy
home? No, you're divorced, reader, and your dad day doesn't start
until Friday at two. It'll be a short weekend,  reader, because you've
got to work for half of Saturday. If you're not too tired after
bagging groceries and flirting with the checkers and moving laundry
soap from the back of a truck to the back of the store, you might get
to play video games with your son in the evening. You might get to

Matthew, I'm curious what your point is.....that you disagree with
John's statement?
  that perhaps "artists are the servants of the elite class" is more
true?

This assumes some kind of hospital birth.  In 1987 my son was born at
home (I got to catch him)...  it cost about $500 for everything.  I
can't imagine midwives out here charging more than a couple thousand
at this point.

by jove, by donald, by prancer and dixon, i think we have a winner.

this is terrific, jason.

i like the interface, the idea of the text being generated as in a slot
machine of spinning wheels. with lots of xm(a)s detritus. and it ends up
looking like a xmas parcel. in the fireplace. and, best of all, the
"christmas disasters" are demented and cheering. and, o mi gawd, coherent.
and the "terrible xmas songs" stocking stuffers are amusing also.

i'm told that the official reading will be the 29th from 9-11. sorry
i don't recall venue---didn't make mental note as i don't think i can
make that hour. i'm sure they'll announce.

i'm the one who wrote in earlier to say that when i made an effort to
do this, i was strongly cautioned not to compete with any of the
events mla president marjorie perloff is putting together. it *is* a
daunting slate and since this probably *is* a rare year when poetry
will have the spotlight, i was glad to have been forewarned.

that said, as tod notes, the 28th has some openings.

the dim

It's a dim day today, I've shared my family again with all of the
Democrats who would have voted Green in the last election, you remember
the one when I found that cute dog on the street the other day, well it
turned out it belonged to someone on the next block so I returned it with
great happiness. Now it's raining out and I'm waiting for Madge to call,
well Made and I don't get along so well, do we, Tim? Tim's Madge's
husband, and we've gone the rounds a few times I can tell you. My mom's
always saying "you never know" but I always reply "you sure do don't you"
just like when she says "I'm going to call dad" and I say "what are you
going to call him" and she says "i'm going to call him dad" or something
like that. Now it's starting to rain out or at least it's getting it's
getting darker and that smudgy feeling when you look out the window. The
traffic light's changed again, it always does that this time of day.

I'm very  interested in the connection between poetry and philosophy. Broadly
 there
is the  philosophy that wants logic and science to the rule, and then there
is the  poetic
element to  philosophy, so much tied up in language, that wants to make sense
of things
but not a cost  of dehumanizing them. A poetry with purpose...Wm. James below
could as
easily be  talking about poetry/poets.
Finnegan
http://ursprache.blogspot.com
Philosophy,  beginning in wonder ... is able to fancy everything different
from what it is.  It sees the familiar as if it were strange, and the strange as
if it were  familiar. It can take things up and lay them down again. Its mind
is full of air  that plays round every subject. It rouses us from our native
dogmatic slumber  and breaks up our caked prejudices....A man with no
philosophy in him is the  most inauspicious and unprofitable of all possible social
mates.

We had two home births in the last four years; each cost us $600.  I caught them both and gave them each a nice navel.

  I'm currently going for an MFA in Oregon; it's costing me about $1500 a year.

Amy, thanks for posting JA's "My Philosophy of Life." To quote a few lines:

"I'd sort of let things be what they are
while injecting them with the serum of the new moral climate
I thought I'd stumbled into,"

I love JA's "sort of" -- the "sort of" of letting things be what they are, which
means "sort of" not letting them be at all:

"...as a stranger
accidentally presses against a panel and a bookcase slides back,
revealing a winding staircase with greenish light
somewhere down below, and he automatically steps inside
and the bookcase slides shut, as is customary on such occasions.
At once a fragrance overwhelms him--not saffron, not lavender,
but something in between.  He thinks of cushions, like the one
his uncle's Boston bull terrier used to lie on watching him
quizzically, pointed ear-tips folded over. And then the great rush
is on.  Not a single idea emerges from it.  It's enough
to disgust you with thought."

Thanks,

Tom Devaney

As a freshman at the U of Kansas, most of my courses were taught by
graduate students.  In my experience, my teachers in the liberal arts
were talking heads.  I had a psychology teacher who couldn't imagine
falling back asleep to keep dreaming, "that's impossible," and
"nearsightedness is counter-evolved."  Ha !  The philosophy teacher most
concerned by his ability to memorize all our names.  Two English
teachers who were just plain ugly and stupid, as they say, and a third
English teacher wowed that my chemistry section had us writing "not in
the passive voice."  Apparently it was being drilled into her that
science relies heavily on the passive voice.  That's funny, too.  But I
loved her, she was great. In the science courses the grad student
teachers were clear-headed, replete with actual instruction -- do this,
do that, & you'll progress to the next level; while the arts teachers,
"if you don't do that, if you don't do this, you won't be as brilliant
as me."  Of course the sciences are privileged, now.  I understand that
people in the arts really suffer, nowadays.  I really understand that.
Don't think I don't understand that.

& let me re-state: rejecting philosophy is plain good philosophy.

Gaston Bachelard is an excellent person to read re philosophy and poetry.
Bachelard wrote for decades on philospohy and/of science, before turning to
poetry and becoming the great philosopher of poetics, making use of wide
rnage of methods and very wide range of poetic source materials.  (He was an
omnivorous reader--and one of best readers of poetry have encountered.)  He
developed psychologies and phenomonologies of poetics, making use also of
alchemical sources.  Some titles:  Poetics of Space, Psychoanlysis of Fire,
Poetics of Reverie, Air and Dreams:  Am essay on the imgination of Movement,
The Right to Dream, Fragments of a Poeics of Fire, Lautreamont, Earth and
Reveries of Will, Earth and Reveries of Repose, Bachelard On Poetic
Imagination and Reverie
(a title from his scientific writing career: The Experience of Space
inContmeporary Physics)

I would recommend beginning reading him with The Poetics of Space, his most
popular work and also has superb Introduction in which he outlines his
development, methods, etc.

The works of Michel Serres on literature and the sciences are also excellent
and very stimulating.

Reading Bachelard is like finding unexpected universes continually opening
--in the interior worlds of reverie, imagination, poetry and the exterior
worlds of the senses and matter.  A unique and magificent thinker and
writer.  (And also human being from all accounts of him.)

am sorry to write this & then disappear for a few days but am working
non-stop--but after reading this must say, please, what do you expect the
israelis to do? esp now that the palestinian factions are fighting each
other? I know some on this listserv will be furious that I'm writing this--I
got blasted, even abused, when I wrote when Israel invaded Lebanon--but it's
just an impossible situation--the israelis are tired, too, and want peace,
and they have rockets shot at them every day and tens of thousands of
extremists who want to see all israelis, if not all jews, dead--really, what
are they to do? there are about 40 terrorist attempts in israel every day,
targetting civilians. the situation is so entrenched that unless the
international community comes in and helps create a peace on the ground it's
not going to happen. i am very left abt the US and have spent many yrs
working as a volunteer for Oxfam--raising $60,000 from poetry readings! to
go to the poorest countries in the world and have given a lot of money to a
jewish org that is working in darfur, helping muslims as well as others
there & in 40 other countries--I don't mean to say I'm a particularly moral
person, just to say I haven't been totally oblivious to suffering in this
barbaric (and wonderful) world. peace.

My book, THE LAMA'S ENGLISH LESSONS, is now available from Three Candles
Press.

More info below and at:

http://threecandles.org/press/books.htm

Best,
Tony

*************************************

*Tony Trigilio:* The Lama's English Lessons (poems)

96 Pages, $12.95, ISBN: 0-9770892-1-5

"In /The Lama's English Lessons/, Trigilio navigates a postmodern
American urbanscape searching for grace. He calmly chronicles the way
the natural and the mechanical now interpenetrate, taking on each
other's characteristics, missions: 'The cabs stupefied / at the airport
like cattle.' In his quest he encounters the homeless, baseball, TV,
special prosecutors, jazz, Lee Harvey Oswald, the proclamations of
newscasters and ex-presidents, and the legacies of WW II and Vietnam. He
discovers odd moments of humor and transcendence in the mass transit,
multi tasking madness we're trapped, in a confluence of personal and
public histories, and manages to float above it all, maintaining perfect
spiritual equilibrium, like strains of Buddhist music."

    --- /Amy Gerstler/


"A quietude pervades this boffo first collection, the poems aglint with
disaster. In a time of war, Trigilio tracks our sadness calmly, ever
aware of the expense of spirit spent on anger. But don't be misled:
these poems do plenty, graciously, elegantly, and with the ardent
skepticism of a man living awake in the twenty-first century. Alfred
Nobel would be proud: this book's full of peace and dynamite."

Ruth,=20
I'm entirely with you on this. I belong to Shalom Ahshav, have always
militated for a peace settlement based on a clearly defined, secure and
viable frontier between two states and do not consider myself an insensitiv=
e
hawk any more than you do. But these calls to boycot horrify me. There is
and there always was a left-wing anti-semitism, posing now as anti-sionism.
Anyone caring for some measure of peace and justice in the region should
stay well aware of this...and of the very peculiar history of british left
wing intelligentsia in that respect.
Shalom.

modern spin on the Hitchcock classic Psycho. Three
separate women play Marion Crane -- now immortalized
by Janet Leigh and a certain shower scene-in three
different scenes. Official selection Tribeca Film
Festival and won Best Experimental Film at 2005
Chicago International Film Festival and 2006 SXSW Film
Festival. Director will be at the salon

Deathdealer: A Documentary follows an angel of death
played by Punk Rock musician and poet Henry Rollins as
he goes about his daily work suited and booted,
hanging out in diners and acting like a regular guy --
moaning about his hum drum life -- the film is about
the need for change and how we can make them -- told
in a humorous and typically rollin-esque fashion.
Directed by Andy Watts. Film provided by

I'm with Chris on this. Israeli policy towards=20
the Palestineans is proof, if it were needed,=20
that Jews are no brighter than others. And I say=20
that as a Jew. If Israel restored the 1967 line=20
it would be no more vulnerable to rocket attacks=20
than it is now, and there would be a lot fewer=20
folks who'd want to send those rockets. Which is=20
not to say that it would be easy, but easy isn't=20
what they've got now. What keeps something so=20
eminently sensible from happening is Israeli=20
electoral politics. That, and ineffectual US=20
policy. Israel's success is based on 12 billion=20
dollars a year in US loan guarantees. No reason=20
(except that a lot of American Jews are none too=20
bright either, and US politicians never tink=20
beyond two years) that those guarantees shouldn't be conditonal.

Avoiding criminal regimes is difficult if one=20
likes to travel, and I've been in my share of=20
places with horrendous governments. But I haven't=20
and won't go to Israel--my personal boycott. The=20
difference is pure atavism--as a Jew I feel a=20
responsibility for Israel's crimes that I don't=20
feel for Castro's. I doubt that I'll live long=20
enough to go to Jerusalem on my own terms.

From:         Jim Andrews <jim@VISPO.COM>
Subject:      responding to Ron Silliman's blog entry on the cutup
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

"But a lot more important than figuring out just who should get credit for
cutting up & folding in is fathoming just why this move at this exact moment
in history. "
Silliman at http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com

Ron quotes Burroughs, who famously remarked in the sixties that "The cut-up
method brings to writers the collage, which has been used by painters for
fifty years." Burroughs also notes its use in film and photography.

The cutup involves a media artist's or painter's sense of the writer's
'material'. Usually when a writer speaks of 'the material' of his or her
writing, what's referred to is the subject matter and the little sub-stories
or central metaphors, that sort of thing, not the media.

Practice in other arts is generally more familiar with the energies and
methodologies of the cut. Partially because the grammars of image and sound
are not associated with so many rules and expectations. The structures of
sentences are predicated on scads of grammar rules. Whereas when images are
created, the rules are not so strong. To break the rules of grammar is
something that is seemingly more involved in breaking useful rules about how
we make sense to one another than the same sorts of operations in the visual
or sonic. The constraints upon the syntax of sentences are more deeply
structural than the constraints in visual art or sound art or even film. We
spend years learning the rules of grammar and how to write coherent
sentences, paragraphs, etc, and it's hard-won, a 'triumph into literacy'. To
then start working with cutups involves a radically different branching out
into language. It's more a 'branching out' than simply a 'different step'.
It's multiple, combinatorial.

So part of the answer to Ron's question of 'why this moment in history for
the cutup?' must surely be that the technique has been cultivated in many
other arts over the last hundred years. Even if the technique is more
problematical in writing, the adoption in literary practice has clearly
followed from practice in other arts.

But why has this technique come to be more or less commonly practiced in so
many arts over the last century?

Partly because when working with media such as film or audio tape, cutting
apart/together is necessary in even modest journalistic compositions, never
mind getting fancy with the razor blade and getting a feel for it as a
stroke of art. The materiality of film and recorded sound has been crucial,
I suspect. But even in modernism, there's collaging in things like Pound's
Cantos and widespread experimentation with juxtaposition in, say,
surrealism. Or the visual publications of Dada and Futurism. But it's less
developed as part of a world view. What distinguishes Burroughs in his work
with the audio and written cutup is not only that disturbing brilliant
trilogy and his influential audio cutups, but the world view he wrote about
and developed both in the work and in fascinating writings about the method
and its relations to cognition, addiction, originality, intention,
goverance, language as virus...

It's not simply the work itself but the world view etched into the work and
life. Burroughs developed a whole poetics or philosophy of the cutup. The
cutup is not simply a technique of novelty for him. It's a technique to help
alter one's own programming as a writer. It also involves questioning
conscious intention as the only way to worthwhile, consequential, even
'authentic' writing. "When you cut audio tape, the future leaks out." The
future of writing, for instance.

One can look at the cutup as a consequence of explorations, as above, of the
materiality of media, whether the medium is visual or sonic or textual.

I would ask you to also look at the following and its relations with the
growing emphasis throughout the twentieth century on materiality.

Concerning the language machine, I gotta say--with great enthusiasm--go out
and buy Martin Davis's book "The Universal Computer: From Leibniz to Turing"
(the softcover version is called "Engines of Logic"). That book gives a
better sense than any other I've encountered of the proximity of things like
the development of the computer to our whole sense of language. Davis traces
the development of the computer from "Leibniz's dream" of basically a
language of symbolic logic and a machine capable of generating true
propositions in that language.

I suggest that the cutup technique is part of a whole change in our
perspectives on language and machines--and ourselves.

In the theory of computation, language is one of the central subjects of
study--in the same sort of way that billiard-ball-like-objects are a central
concern of physics. In the theory of computation, language is studied as
strings of letters that can be generated, parsed, recognized, etc. The
theory looks at the *mathematical* properties of such collections of
strings, or languages. This isn't quite the same as an emphasis on the
materiality of language, but it's obviously related in that it involves
operations on strings of symbols, operations more or less independent of the
'meaning' of the symbols.

In the literary and general art history of the twentieth century, we see a
growing concern with and practice involving cutups and their related
techniques of collage and juxtaposition. Involving what were unusual
operations on language and image, tape, film, etc. And we also see the rise
of the theory of computation in which language is crucial. Language is
crucial to programmability and the whole idea of the computer, going all the
way back to Leibniz. It has often been said that language draws a magic
circle round the realm of the thinkable. And the programmable.

Our thoughts and images on what a human being is have changed in the
twentieth century, have expanded to include the notion that we are soft
machines. Just as Darwin gave us the conceptual framework to imagine
humanity proceeding from the evolution of the most primitive of life-forms,
so too has the theory of computation and its consequences given us the
conceptual tools to imagine the mind as a soft computing machine--that
wildly exceeds, at the moment, the capacities of all modern computers.
Still, there is no accepted proof that there exist thought processes of
which humans are capable and computers are not, in theory and eventual
practice.

So that the fusion of language and logic, in the realization of Leibniz's
dream, results in machines and languages capable of thought itself. That is
what thought is.

And the cutup becomes a type of operation on language involved in our
growing awareness of the poetential fecundity of dynamic process in
language. The cutup lets us peek into the interzones of texts, the
nether-worlds between the lines where the cyborg emerges.

The only thing that could make me lose my reason sufficiently to support this boycott is the abusive cry of "antisemitism" that rises up every time someone criticizes Israel, let alone suggests taking action against it. Nonsense. One of the things I can't bear about Israel is how it has hijacked my Jewish identity. If antisemitism is on the increase in the world, as it probably is, then I point my finger at the actions of Israel in recent years as causes of this. (For what it's worth, I date the moral downfall of Israel from the election of Netanyahu as Prime Minister after the assassination of Rabin--as if the electorate was thereby supporting the cause of Rabin's assassin.)

  That said, I would not support this boycott because I have not seen anything to convince me that it will help strangthen those factions within Israel that are still working for peace. When South Africa was being boycotted, it was clear that those South Africans we wanted to support (e.g., the ANC) were in its favor.

I agree with Barry wholeheartedly.

I've posted this link before, but it's a nice little read:

http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n06/mear01_.html

"The Israel Lobby"

In my opinion, the wrong target is Israel. In my opinion, any lobby
determined to change the state of the Middle East should aim itself at
the US government which underpins the State of Israel with implicit
and explicit actions. For example, the Iraq Study Group recommended
talking to Iran and Syria. Given that talking to Iran or Syria is
inimical to the State of Israel's foreign policy, I do not think it
coincidental that Bush rejected this option. So, trying to influence
your own government's foreign policy would be a start, even to the
extent of trying to follow the USA's own interests in the Middle East;
but don't be surprised if this, too, is called anti-semitic.

very interesting thoughts jim. I've been playing with doing textual cutup using recordings of text for a while, and then transcribing the results back to text. one thing i've noticed about that process is that there are what i've taken to calling 'translation errors' in the cutup process. Places where, as the words are recombined, new words seem to be suggested. it's even more pronounced working in sound rather than print, because there aren't the visual cues to suggest the boundaries of words.

just my $.02

        -------------------------------------
Hut Tech and bare life


"When the shack dweller lays in supplies, she is composing a politics."
Lisa Robertson

This issue of Perforations was generated because
of papers found during a reconstruction of Fehta
Murghana's hut. She had constructed it herself as
a writer's retreat but was fond of calling it a
'witch hut', always fantasizing putting it on
legs as the famous hut-on-chicken-legs of the
Russian witch fable Baba Yaga, creating an image
of inner mobility only seemingly at odds with the
the apparent rooted nature of the hut.

This issue/node of Perforations will concede the
perimeter to the hut and hut dwellers everywhere,
but also examines the oxymorons of thought which
the hut generates at the center (potentially),
such as the 'rooted nomadism' of the hut dweller
and perhaps even the 'revolutionary
conservativism' of such, including its modern
anti-modernism. Murghana herself was well aware
of the uncanny nature of the 'hut,' seeing it as
enabling portents and revenants, neither of which
are wanted in the modern world, yet both are
continuously courted through the hypermodern
technical networks which course through
contemporary life, binding and separating at the
same time.

We begin with Murghana's musings on the hut, but
several writers have lately taken to heart, (not
forgetting Rykwert's history of the hut), the
enigma of the hut, such as Anne Cline, Lisa
Robertson, and most lately Adam Scharff in a
recently released book on Heidegger's Hut. We
have enabled the basic text along the way with
quotes from the above.

What is 'Hut / Tech', that such frabjous entities
can be held together by a stroke, a dividing line
between the nether poles of a magnet? Another
oxymoron? Who are the dwellers of huts, either in
thought or corporeally? Does the hut embody some
sort of midway point between homeless and home?
Between presence and absence? Is there any future
for the hut or is it to be relegated to economic
end-zones of emergency and to the camps of the
coming era? Is there the 'hut of last resort' and
then the freely chosen hut? Or is the very nature
of the hut a last resort=8Aand hence a resort to
primal potentiality, both ending and beginning?
(After all, the three most notable hut dwellers
in recent memory are Henry Thoreau, Theodore
Kacynski, and Martin Heidegger, all of which
would seem to be problematic for the modern
cultural inhabitant --besides being white,
western males -- of the current wave of
hyperdevelopment in re: to lofts, townhouses,
tract Macmansions, all examples of a certain form
of maximalism and neo-liberal justifications of a
new economic order. And of course with the above
dwellers, the hut is often seen as a breeding
ground of primordial darkness in its willful,
almost-Nietzschean separation from culture,
civilization, and society.:

"What we crave is not Rosseau's solitude but the
excellent series of origin dwindling on ahead
into the future. Thus we love shacks. Each leads
erotically to the next. One sojourns, or starts
out, rather than settles, in a shack. Domestic
duration, like childhood, is transient, serial. A
shack is always timely. Typically an account of
the history of architecture will begin with a
shack."
Lisa Robertson

But the hut also seems oddly timeless in its
aspect of catering to bare life, which exists as
a possibility everywhere and everywhen.
Is there any place left for the minimalisms of
the hut? For its limitations, its 'insect
politics,' its dark broodings, its centrality in
a haunted, uncanny landscape? Or are the
compacted maximalisms of favelas, the psychic
densities and thickenings and potential new forms
which they seem to prophesy, more exacting? In
all cases the 'hut' avers between opacity and
transparency, justifying both, on different
occasions, preserving both as trans-temporal
exigencies which advance, retreat (and sublime)
into spiritualities, goblins, ghosts, ethers, and
materializations at the drop of a hat.


Please fell free to send us your hut life, even if it only resides as a dre=
am,
a whistle in the dark.

Please feel free to send us the minimals that you
are able to squeeze out of everyday,
   the disguised trans-temporalities that make up hut life
in the middle of empire,
that make up hope in the middle of loss and abandon,
like lotus seeds found in the bottom of a three thousand year old pyramid.

Hut / Tech
Fehta Murghana

1) How, now, could anyone possibly advocate the
'weakness' of the hut or the shack, its glaring
idleness, downtime, bricoleur-ness, and embrace
of decay? Like difficult or impossible speech,
its perceived weakness (the weakness of opacity
in the one, the weakness of the minimum in the
former) is actually a form of strength.

2) The hut/cabin/shack is the epicenter of
'experimentalism,' even if 'only' vernacular.
Always successful and always a failure, both at
the same time; the necessity which the hut
represents is precisely that: "The economy of the
shack enumerates necessity, or more exactly it
enumerates a dream of necessity, using what's at
hand." (Lisa Robertson 1)

script with stupid question


is this a found script or one i created? does it really matter? given the
relatively small number of symbols, it would be reasonable to apply coding to
it - a matrix/template that might slide across the apparent grid, producing
meaning. one might think of this as a _universal machine_ applicable to texts
of any length; it becomes increasingly evident that meaning is a construct
_across_ symbols, neither within them nor within the dictionary translation /
transliterations.

here, in this example, only in this particular example, one has a section of
what seems to be an _infinite text,_ a text in the manner of a bandage or
suture across the wound of a sememe (what reads as a sememe); a wound within,
unconstrued within, the imaginary. think of this as the _lid_ of the
_pre-linguistic_ - not exactly mode, but a potential for interpreta- tion,
sliding out and against itself, as soon as one is found. nothing holds here,
not even "here," not even place or placement. the lesson, where we are, where
we are not, is always already unlearned.

Alan, when you say meaning is a construct "across" symbols, neither within them or their definitions, that puts me in mind of two things.

the first is Wittgensteins pronouncement that meaning reduces to the function of words in a language in almost all cases, and that if you know how a word is used in a language then you know what the word means.

the second is the philosophical conception of supervenience which is defined generally as follows: "a set of stuff A supervenes on a set of some stuff B iff. nothing can differ about A without differring about B as well."

I wonder how this might relate or contrast with your notion of acrossness.

Anyone heard of Julie Burchill, Guardian columnist who left the paper three
years ago ? Well, have a go at what she wrote at that time :

http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,1094420,00.html

And I feel that my jewish identity was hurt both by the Soviet Union (end o=
f
one part of my family) and by the Third Reich (end of another part of said
family). "Hijacking" (if such be the case) seems a piece of cake... By the
way, the moral downfall dates back to the first war in Lebanon (that's when
Shalom Ahshav, Peace Now, began). I'll keep doing my part to promote a peac=
e
settlement and a viable palestinian state AND I'll keep criticizing israeli
government each time they play against peance and justice (note: and
justice), AND I'll keep trying to figure out why this is so in the
situation, as well as why palestinian authorities  often do such stupid
things (I'm NOT speaking about Mahmoud Abbas and the likes of him whom I
admire  and whose voluntarist optimism I feel compelled to share at least o=
n
second thoughts - the first thoughts are utterly pessimistic) AND I'll keep
saying again and again that many times antisemitism masquerades as
antisionism. Well, I guess all that makes me a hijacked shtunk of some
sort... or at best a yokel in the eyes of the righteous.
whatever... piece of cake, I said...

family). "Hijacking" (if such be the case) seems a piece of cake... By the
way, the moral downfall dates back to the first war in Lebanon (that's when
Shalom Ahshav, Peace Now, began). I'll keep doing my part to promote a peace
settlement and a viable palestinian state AND I'll keep criticizing israeli
government each time they play against peance and justice (note: and
justice), AND I'll keep trying to figure out why this is so in the
situation, as well as why palestinian authorities often do such stupid
things (I'm NOT speaking about Mahmoud Abbas and the likes of him whom I
admire and whose voluntarist optimism I feel compelled to share at least on
second thoughts - the first thoughts are utterly pessimistic) AND I'll keep
saying again and again that many times antisemitism masquerades as
antisionism. Well, I guess all that makes me a hijacked shtunk of some
sort... or at best a yokel in the eyes of the righteous.
whatever... piece of cake, I said...

thank you michael! she may be right-wing but sure isn't in this article.
women are in prison in iraq, afraid to leave their homes--see article this
week in boston globe. burchill is right abt women's rights & israel--anyone
pro-woman must agree that women are freer in israel than in any other middl=
e
east country.=20
and it seems that only israel gets commented up on on this list serv--no
articles or comments abt how minorities are abused in other mid-east
countries, or abt darfur where there is a holocaust going on, or as I heard
on INN yesterday there's a new repot that says 10 million female fetuses
have been aborted or newborn baby girls killed--mostly by being buried aliv=
e
or by having sand etc poured into their noses. or abt govt violence in lati=
n
america.=20
if left-wing has something to do w/ believing that every human being has
human rights & must be fed & given opportunities than let's think abt the
75% of the hungry people in this world who are women and children. how many
jews are there in the world-- to be blamed for so many problems!
of course israel has done awful things, and peace is finally the only answe=
r
and of course war kills the innocent--now 80-85% of people killed in wars
are civilians--those who are the victims of the very regime the others are
trying to overthrow. and regimes that take over through violence usually
turn into tyrannical govts. ok, I realize I'm lecturing and over the
top--better stop drinking coffee for awhile & get back to work--but to be a
left-wing jew in the US these days is to see some contradictions.

c'mon, i'm not suggesting starving grown men--just pointing out that women =
&
children of color are disproportionately poor.
i know the argument abt 'client states'--but there's plenty we cd do abt
pressuring the US to give more to other countries--I really doubt that's wh=
y
there is so much commentary abt it--it seems so much more emotional than
that.

A note about recent publications for all of those curious and who do
not know of the following:

AN EXPERIMENT IN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, poetry in markszine.com
Editor-in-chief and webmaster Deb King; special issue (2006) curated by
Carla Harryman
web address: http://markszine.com/703/ac/ind.htm

NOTES ON SINCERITY AND IRONY, chapter essay in Stan Brakhage Filmmaker,
edited by David James (Temple University Press 2005)

THIS IS CALLED MOVING: A Poetics of Film, full-length book divided into
three sections: Sex Talk =96on women and film and theory;
Matrix =97on work by colleagues, contemporary and historical;
Interrogations =97on my work: interviews, articles and transcripts.
(University of Alabama Press, 2005).
About this book:
        "This is a splendidly original collection of essays, comments, and
interviews. Child has published books of poetry (Mob, 1994; Scatter
Matrix, 1996) in the same venues as the so-called L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E
poets, and her writing style sometimes resembles the fragmented but
idea-filled paragraphs one finds in the prose of Charles Bernstein (A
Poetics, 1992) or Ronald Silliman (The New Sentence, 1987).  Here she
complicates and expands their work substantially, as she transposes the
L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E poet emphasis on writing onto the medium of film.
Whereas the L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E poets seem always to be rewriting Gertrude
Stein, Child's work seems much more expansive, with a richer range of
reference.... Including especially moving forays into issues of
sexuality, the totality of the book gives a fine description of the

       In conjunction with the exhibition Joe Brainard: People of the World,
Relax!! the UB Art Galleries and the University at Buffalo Poetry and Rare
Books Collection are proud to present two special events. On Friday, January
26, 2007 at 8pm Ron Padgett and Kenward Elmslie will give a Poetry Reading
at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery. The event, Mixed Media, is part of the
Gusto at the Gallery Series and will also feature local favorites the David
Kane Quartet and a site specific performance by Nimbus Dance. Poet Ron
Padgett grew up in Tulsa, where he met Joe Brainard at the age of six.
Padgett's recent books include the memoir, Oklahoma Tough: My Father, King
of the Tulsa Bootleggers, the collection of poems, You Never Know, and Joe:
A Memoir of Joe Brainard. As a member of the first generation New York
School of Poets, Kenward Elmslie introduced contemporary poetry to Broadway
in the form of musicals. Among his many books of poetry, Kenward Elmslie has
also created work for the musical stage: Postcards on Parade, City Junket,
and an adaptation of Truman Capote's The Grass Harp.

       On Thursday, February 1, 2007 at 1pm a Brown Bag Lunch Lecture by
Steven Clay will take place at the UB Art Gallery in the First Floor
Gallery. Steven Clay, publisher of Granary Books, is an editor, curator and
archivist specializing in the American art and literature of the 1960s, '70s
and '80s. He is the author, with Rodney Phillips, of A Secret Location on
the Lower East Side: Adventures in Writing 1960-1980. Both events are free

And women and children in the occupied territories, I'd wager.  So may
we expect from you a call for Israel to end its illegal occupation?

I imagine that during the heyday of apartheid there were all kinds
of "good liberals" in South Africa saying that in the end, we
treat "our" blacks so much better than they treat each other when they
get a chance, at least they're not starving, goodness knows, so why
would you people in the rich countries dare advocate sanctions, which
only hurt the people you're trying to help?

And no, it's not lost on me that Israel was a staunch supporter of
South African apartheid (despite the presence of ferocious anti-
Semites in the SA governing elite), and doubtless learned a few things
about how to build a bantustan and even how to foment internecine
warfare (remember the ANC-Inkatha wars of the 1980s?).  Nor that they
supplied experts in counter-insurgency (even back then they called it
counter-terrorism) to the Argentine and Guatemalan juntas, and to the
Nicaraguan contras (having gotten along nicely with Somoza).

Or are those facts too emotional?

Subject:      the cut-up & revolt against programming
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

     Burroughs oftein cited Brion Gysin as the source of his interest in the
cut-ups, also Gysin's remark that writing lagged fifty years painting.
Burroughs' interest in the cut-ups is in a number of related areas.  One is
that by cutting up texts, one is "break(ing) through in the grey room" where
the program of edited reality films is made.  This is to break down
control--the control of events as pre-concstructed by the total work of art
of language-image-sound which is imposed on one as "reality" in an
unalterable sequence of events--i.e. a programming, as Burroughs notes the
Mayan calendar is an instruemnt of control, so Time magazine and the media
are instruments of programmed control.  Burroughs' ultimate aim stated over
and over, is to get rid of written language and replace it with a visual
pictographic/hieroglyphic notation which can be transmitted silently--no
sound articulated in the mind at all--direct transmission along the lines of
telepathy.  (His interest in yage was inspired in part by claims he had
heard that it enabled one to communicate telepathically.) This form of
transmission has as it goal to liberate one in terms of time and space
travel. Via the cut-up, the element of chance is opened up to--and when
chance flows through, the hidden face of both control and its breaking down
can be found.  Patterns emerge that were previously hidden, revealing on the
one hand hidden orders, and on the other, poetentialites for their breakdown
and reconfiguration.  The entropic/negentropic possibilities of the elements
which with one works, the areas in which uncertainty moves among order and
chaos, noise and music, iamge and decomposition become avaiable as an area
in which on can live ouside the imposed controls especially of language and
programming.  This is introduced in  his first book, Junkie, with Burroughs'
emphasis on the contingent which ends the statement following the small
"Glossary" section to the book.  "Not only do the words change meanings but
meanings vary locally at the same time.  A final glossary, therefore, cannot
be made of words whose intentions are fugitive."
         (A great example of this exists in the poetry of Francois Villon,
who worked simulatenously, within a poem, a line,  in both the common spoken
language and in the "jargon", the secret language of the vast criminal
networks spread nomadically throughout the France of his time. In reading
Villon, one finds simultaneously existing language which is of great clarity
and force, and language which is in many instances as inpenetrable as the
egyptian heiroglyphics before the finding of the Rosetta Stone.
     The emphasis on visuality--Burroughs worked with film and sound
recrodings on cut-ups and later in life beacme a painter--using randomness
of shooting boards of his paintings with guns to release chance forms as
well as explode the colors in chance conigurations--this emphasis on
visuality leading the way goes back to the beginning of modernism.
      Modernism is first defined by Baudelaire in "The Painter of Everyday
Life":  "He (the painter "ceaselesly journeying across the great human
desert" of the city) is looking for that quality which you must allow me to
call modernity; for I know of no better word to express what I have in mind.
  He makes it his business to extract from fashion whatever element of it
may contain of poetry within history, to distill the eternal from the
transitory . . . By 'modernity' I mean the ephermeral, the fugitive, the
contingent, the half of art whose other half is eternal and immutable."
       Baudelaire and Burroughs both use the word "fugiitive" and Baudeliare
also uses a word Olson often employs--the "contingent".
     It's very intereting that Baudelaire finds the artist of modernity to
be a painter in that Baudelaire himself invented the prosepoem, whcih is a
response to the rhythms of modernity in the rapidly changing urban
envirirnment, in the speeding up  of modes of transport, perception and
communication and process of reproduction of words and images.  (Baudelaire
portrays the painter of modernity--his example is Constantin Guys--as the
opposite of the flanuer--Guys is always hurrying, hurrying--a purposeful
cousin to Poe's dromomanical "Man in the Crowd" or De Quincey's opium
eater's endless walks around night time London, moving in a kind of
psychogeogrpahical derive well before the wine  drinking Lettristes and
Situationistes.) (Baudelaire is also the translator of Poe and De Quincey.)
      Yet what is beginning to propel greater freedom in painting is the
advent of something Baudelaire is antagonistic towards--photography.  It is
new forms of visuality in a changing painting and in photography which are
leading the way in changing in approaches to thinking about the elements of
their media, which eventually find their way into writing.
       (In "Nature" Emerson also notes a changing visuality is opening
literally "new frontiers"--he notes how things look differently at different
rates of speed--already the "estrangement" and "aleination" effect can be
produced by riding in a carriage, but how much more so the ways things are
seen from the increasing speeds of the locomotive.  Like Poe's "Purloined
Letter" for Emerson--as for Baudelaire's painter and as photography is
beginning to show--"the blank and ruin we see in nature is within our own
eye".  That is, the "new world" and "original relation with the universe"
come with a revolution in one's "ways of seeing things" so to speak.  What
becomes found, discovered, is that whih like Poe's letter is hidden in plain
sight.  Or as i prefer to pharse it hidden in plain site/sight/cite. Changes
in seeing become ways to break down the programming of Burroughs' grey room
of control which is imposed by written language as programmable, a contract
by which one is bound.  "If it is not in writing it never happened" is a
sign frequently seen in offices of bureaucary and institutions of
control--social services, legal system etc are sites one often finds this
dire warning--or sympathetic "word to the wise" depending on th way you want
to take it at any particular moment.
          Although not recognized until about fifty years later, Lautremont
in 1868/9 in Malodoror already recognizes the role that chance will play in
the revolt against programmed perception and language, when he writes of the
chance meeting of a sewing machine and an umbrella on an operating table.
The presence of the sewing mchine on an operating table isn't so far
fetched--after all, like the doctor, it is a device for suturing-(Burrough's
Dr Benway is a kind of anti-suturing being) -later to become the operation
of a film editor on the editing table, or the cutting up and suturing of
images and texts in cut-ups.  The umbrella?-let the mind start racing with
associations!  As i heard a woman say at bus stop, brandishing her umbrella
on an overcast morning--"ain't nobody gonna rain on MY parade!"  Damn
straight!
       The role of chnace and visuality--modern visual poetry is usually
said to begin with Mallarme's text, "A Throw of the dice will Never Abolish
Chance".
        In Dada  Art and Anti-Art hans Richter writes that the pioneer of
chance in dada is the painter/poet Hans/Jean Arp. Before  the tossed "word
slads" of the poets, Arp had discovered by chance the freedom in chance:
working with some colored paper forms he couldn't get to work "right" in
trying to exprss himself, he threw the pices up in the air and let them fall
on the floor.  Looking at them a little later he realzied with a shock they
were expressing exaclty what  he had been after,m yet incapble of doing on
his own.  He  glued the piece in the patterns in which they had fallen and
from there continued to work with chance in his visual/relief works.  (Arp
is also an overlooked, very good poet, in both French and German.)
     "Chance became our tradmark" Richter writes of the Dadaists.  Chnace
was a great stimulatr and opener ofquestions whith which Burroughs also
works in with his cut-ups:  "Was it the artist's unconscious mind, or a
power outside him, that had spoken?  Was a mysterious "collborator" at work,
a power in which one could place one's trust?  Was it part of oneself, or a
combination of factors uite beyond anyone's control?"  Richter sees the Dada
activities as forerunners of Ujung's ideas and explorations of
synchronicity.  " . . . the use of chance had opened up an important new
diemnsion in art:  the techniquesof free asosociation, fragmenetary trians
of thought, unexpected juxtapostions of words and sounds.  In the field o
viual art this new freedom had consequences that were possibly even more
far-reaching."

Re the question abt why this articular mmoment i wrote at the appropriate
place, comments,  re an important influence in the 1950's on paiting,
poetry, happenings etc etc--the painter Robert Motherwell translated and
edited The dada Painters and Poets, still today a great and influential
anthology. I think the role of art critic played by both Ashberry and O'Hara
(and Ashbery's translations) were also very influential in brining things
learned froom painting into writing.  there is also a great infleunce
inchanges in music at the time, inperomance and hapenings and in films both
"undergroiund" and New Wave, with Godard's making use of jump -cuts etc--so
finally about fifty years later than with dada, one finds these things
begining to apear in american poetry.  William Carlos Willaims noted by
Robert Smithson when the latter visited him n late 1950's--that WCW
emphasized the greater role painting and painters had for him than poets in
his work.  (Spring and All is dedicated to the painter Demuth.)
       (And influence very ealry on of the painters Gertrude Stein knew on
her writing--esp Cubism--)
     Smithson writes that "the artit's art of looking" , a glance even, cnbe
as solid as any work of art which is valued by society as an object, but the
artit's art of looking is overlooked so to speak--without a ontineual
devlopmen of the art of looking, while it may not be "valued", just as the
time of the artits is not valued, only the work, the object, this also makes
for a freedom from being programmed, it gives artist the opening to continue
to have a "fugitive" art in Brroughs' sense, and one cotinually open to al
the awareness es of chnance, of synchronicities.  The desire is not to be
imprisoned i an object, even in a process, but have an ongoing activity and
expression which is outside of these systems of control.   Burroughs in the
Inroduction to Queer, writes that he writes to keep out of systems of
control whch otherwise take charge of him, of anyone.  Writing is a way out,
outer space, outside of conventioanl programmed language and working to keep
it this way.
This is a way of life, not a series of theoretical or mapped poitions,
formulae for production of new forms of  conformity in langauge and
visuality--
"be street smart, don't get caught" as the slogan of Coup de Grace says.
One can see why Baudelaire first finds it in a painter hurryng through the
streets to take in visually all that he can o make into his works later.
        And at that time also is advent of photography, also working wih the
epehermal, fugivitvie and contingent in a cotinual egagement with the
immutable and eternal.  Photography introduces a new way of expereincing and
recording, a whole new system both of control and of possibilities of
wrecking control.  I think one of  lessons of Burroughs is against the idea
of programming and becoming dependent on it--as he had been on junk and also
on trust fund from the Burroughs family's adding machine patents.  (His
maternal grandafther was Ivy lee, one of the great master manipulators of
word and image--the PR person who remaxde the onstrous robber baron
Rockefller into lovableold guy handing out dimes.  Hitler tried to hire Ivy
lee, but that was one moster too monstrous for even a Rockefleler
remodeler.)
      Andy Gricevich wrote some things very interesting about doubt in a
recent post--the minute, the instant, i hear words like proramming,even when
used to "program chance opeartions" and "strings of meaningless
words"--there is a great deal of doubt about this being necesssarily
wonderful.  Say one creates a Deleuzian plateau of smooth
menainglessness--into this smooth vacant surface will pour the war machines,
systems of  control--there is no resistance there, or sense of ways out
being available at any moment.  Likewise developing systems of language on
the page which are supposed to be resistant and radical etc--if this is
limited to effects on the page and among language only, it offers no
resistance to the forces outside the page and its own closed systems, no
matter who much syntax is disrupted and rearranged and moved about. Gertrude
Stein, for example was a staunch anti-new Deal Republicanm and for al the
assualts on syntax in last decades, the society and institutions have become
ever more conservative. (A Marzist Russian critic of the Italian Futurists'
tour of Russia just before WW1 noted that "paole in liberta" exists on the
page, but not in prop0erty relations--one can disurpt and alter syntax and
have no effects on property tax let alone alone property.  This was
something Stein understood herself.)
      That is one of reasons Burroughs has such an impact--he lived the
thngs of which he wrote, and wrote to change his life.  As he says in
Junkie:  "Junk is not about kicks.  It is a way of life."
     You want to kick the junk habit, the language habit, the control habit,
and the cut-ups and chance, synchornicities, become tools to create those
fugitive words which want to retain being street smart and not being caught,
much like Smithson's idea of the artist's "art of looking" which exists
outside of objects of art.
     There is a kind  of training going on in Burroughs and Smithson, a
training to be a person living oustide of the control imposed on one in any
forms as much as is possible.   (One thinks of Olon's "stance towrds
relaity" in some way with this also.) I think this is related to somethng
Paul Celan wrote (in French in original)--"Poetry shold no longer impose
itself, but expose itself."
      (And isn't photography an arftr of the exposure?--See Mura t
Nemet-Nejat's very stimualting poetry/photogrpahy book The Peripheral Space
of Photography from green Integer.)




       (Schwitters at the same time was writing things like:  "There is no
such thing as chance.  A door may happen to fall shut, but this is not by
chance.  It is a conscious experience of the door, the door the door.")

>Ron quotes Burroughs, who famously remarked in the sixties that "The cut-up

>
>Practice in other arts is generally more familiar with the energies and

>It's multiple, combinatorial.
>

>

>Partly because when working with media such as film or audio tape, cutting

>I suspect. But even in modernism, there's collaging in things like Pound's
>Cantos and widespread experimentation with juxtaposition in, say,
>surrealism. Or the visual publications of Dada and Futurism. But it's less
>developed as part of a world view. What distinguishes Burroughs in his work
>with the audio and written cutup is not only that disturbing brilliant
>trilogy and his influential audio cutups, but the world view he wrote about
>and developed both in the work and in fascinating writings about the method
>and its relations to cognition, addiction, originality, intention,
>goverance, language as virus...
>
>It's not simply the work itself but the world view etched into the work and

>conscious intention as the only way to worthwhile, consequential, even
>'authentic' writing. "When you cut audio tape, the future leaks out." The
>future of writing, for instance.
>
>One can look at the cutup as a consequence of explorations, as above, of
>the
>materiality of media, whether the medium is visual or sonic or textual.
>
>I would ask you to also look at the following and its relations with the
>growing emphasis throughout the twentieth century on materiality.
>
>Concerning the language machine, I gotta say--with great enthusiasm--go out
>and buy Martin Davis's book "The Universal Computer: From Leibniz to
>Turing"
>(the softcover version is called "Engines of Logic"). That book gives a
>better sense than any other I've encountered of the proximity of things

>the development of the computer to our whole sense of language. Davis
>traces
>the development of the computer from "Leibniz's dream" of basically a
>language of symbolic logic and a machine capable of generating true
>propositions in that language.
>
>I suggest that the cutup technique is part of a whole change in our
>perspectives on language and machines--and ourselves.
>
>In the theory of computation, language is one of the central subjects of
>study--in the same sort of way that billiard-ball-like-objects are a
>central
>concern of physics. In the theory of computation, language is studied as
>strings of letters that can be generated, parsed, recognized, etc. The
>theory looks at the *mathematical* properties of such collections of
>strings, or languages. This isn't quite the same as an emphasis on the
>materiality of language, but it's obviously related in that it involves
>operations on strings of symbols, operations more or less independent of
>the
>'meaning' of the symbols.
>
>In the literary and general art history of the twentieth century, we see a
>growing concern with and practice involving cutups and their related
>techniques of collage and juxtaposition. Involving what were unusual
>operations on language and image, tape, film, etc. And we also see the rise
>of the theory of computation in which language is crucial. Language is
>crucial to programmability and the whole idea of the computer, going all
>the
>way back to Leibniz. It has often been said that language draws a magic
>circle round the realm of the thinkable. And the programmable.
>
>Our thoughts and images on what a human being is have changed in the

>machines. Just as Darwin gave us the conceptual framework to imagine
>humanity proceeding from the evolution of the most primitive of life-forms,

>wildly exceeds, at the moment, the capacities of all modern computers.
>Still, there is no accepted proof that there exist thought processes of

>
>So that the fusion of language and logic, in the realization of Leibniz's

Hi David,

Thanks for the terrific post on Burroughs and the cutup. And the revolt
against programming.

Just one thing I'd like to comment on, and that's the "revolt against
programming".

If we are soft machines and the mind is basically software in a wetware
body/brain, then we may strive to understand our own programming and
re-program it, hopefully, when we suffer from its limitations, and scrap
some nasty routines, and revolt against programming imposed on us by
others...and react in other ways as well to programming in different
situations. But a universal revolt against any and all programming misses
the point that it's largely a matter of re-programming that is in order,
given the inescapable condition of our minds themselves being programmable
(and programmed) information processing systems.

Dear Love bugs,

It=B9s the holidays! Time for neighborly compassion, selfless warmth and a
week off for the Poetry Project. We will return on Wednesday 12/28, so
please don=B9t email or call us until then.
Unless of course your email is regarding Volunteering or Food Donating to
our 33rd Annual New Year=B9s Day Marathon.
Be a part of the community by helping this amazing event from behind the
scenes! We promise you will feel just as good! A volunteer with a car (to
help pick up food donations on the afternoon of 12/31 or around noon on 1/1=
)
will receive extra poetry karma points!

If you have already volunteered (the saints out there, you know who you are=
)
do not fret, you will be receiving your time and duty dispatch special from
Southern California, sometime in the next few days.

Hugs,

The Poetry Project

Tinfish Annual Report

In the past year, Tinfish Press has continued to publish excellent
experimental poetry from the Pacific region, with emphasis on writing
and cutting edge design work by artists from Hawai`i and elsewhere. In
2006 we’ve published:

Jozuf Hadley, aka bradajo, TWO POEMS BAI BRADAJO, poems in Hawaiian
Creole English (Pidgin), with accompanying cd. $14

Jacinta Galea`i, ACHING FOR MANGO FRIENDS, a chapbook in English and Samoan.

TINFISH 16, in collaboration with TROUT 13. Another collection of poetry
by various authors who are not usually to be found inside the same
covers. $8

In the near future, we will be publishing:

Leonard Schwartz, LANGUAGE AS RESPONSIBILITY, on the Palestine/Israel
conflict and a poetics of publishing across boundaries.

Sarith Peou, COUNTING CORPSES, poems about life in Cambodia under the
Khmer Rouge.

Pam Brown & Maged Zaher, poems in collaboration.

Kaia Sand on secret Oregon histories.

Hazel Smith’s full-length book EROTICS OF GEOGRAPHY, with accompanying
CD-ROM.

TINFISH 17

THE BEST OF TINFISH COLORING BOOK (with accompanying exhibition). 17
artists will create works based on 17 poems from Tinfish’s 11 year
history; the results will be published as an interactive coloring book.

And, if that’s not enough, we’re hoping to start a reading series that
will pair writers in Hawai`i with writers from elsewhere, to continue
our project of building bridges between local, national, and
international writing.

All of this takes resources. We give our time to the project, but need
money to make our ideas into books. To help us out, please donate some
tax deductible (we are non-profit in more ways than one!) monies to us
at Tinfish Press, 47-728 Hui Kelu Street #9, Kane`ohe, HI 96744, or
through the “purchase” function at http://tinfishpress.com

Better yet, buy some Tinfish Press books! Best wishes for a happy and
productive New Year. May there be some peace for us all.

it sounds like lobotomy, but is probably more like logonomy as
opposed to logology....
and logonomy has the same relation to logology
as astronomy does to astrology, economy to ecology, egonomy to ecology,
though egotomy is but a metonymy for the deeper metology...

i guess i still have a ways to go
in weaning myself from that vobacularic discourse
they slipped in my drink when i got my degree in psychomony
at the church of autonomy or our lady of the logo-tummy

I'm not sure where this is? Wittgenstein developed the notion of language
games - that definitions are fuzzy; he used the example of "game." It's
impossible to pin down the meaning of "game" - every attribute is suscept-
ible to contradiction. So the word game is fluid/fluent, dependent on
context which it also modifies, is part of. It's an extreme conventional-
ism I think.

Can you give me a source here? This is fascinating! It's a bit like super-
imposition in Land's color theory (and the breakdown of Aristotelian dis-
tributivity).

If meaning is a construct across symbols, loosely tethered to them or at
best structurally tethered to them (supervenes?), then two things -
symbols, at least in the sense of graphemes, physical symbols, have no
_inherent_ meaning (which of course Saussure pointed out), but that, not
only sounds slide, but meaning slides as well.

When you (me, anyway) looks at cuneiform, there are all sorts of potential
registers at work - word-loans, say, from Sumerian, Hittite, Assyrian,
etc., the base language itself, the determinative symbols, the syllabic
symbols (which often represent multiple syllables), the ideograms (which
are independent), etc. Whole archeologies are at work, and the surface
appears to be something like a "skittering."

I'm also fascinated by Maturana's pronouncement years ago, that language -
speech - is the "mutual orientation of cognitive domains." This doesn't
mean that speaker A and B agree or comprehend each other (which I think in
a deep way is impossible) - but that the message transmitted and the
(other) message received create an agreement between A and B - that both
"comprehend" each other. This is among other things one of the foundations
of communality.

By the way this applies directly to poetics - how does one extract
"meaning" from a poem? It appears easier with Pope, say, than with Poe,
and easier with Dryden than Dickenson. The former work out of rhetorical
tropes, conceits, the inherence of facticities; the latter slide slant
and, at least for me, problematize (_not_ eliminate) meaning itself.

Finally for me it also relates to codework which is the conceivable
transparency, but at least the apparency, of eruptive/corruptive code
(Kristeva's Powers of Horror come to mind here - even the notion of
"powers" reflects a mathematization) within/against normative language -
as if that that tethering of sliding matrices finally crashlands, like a
floating head on an old harddrive, wrecking havoc among the binary.

Please give a source for supervenience, and thanks greatly!

Women in Israel are freer than anywhere else in the Middle East, indeed...as long as they are not Palestinian.

pro-woman must agree that women are freer in israel than in any other middle
east country.
and it seems that only israel gets commented up on on this list serv--no
articles or comments abt how minorities are abused in other mid-east
countries, or abt darfur where there is a holocaust going on, or as I heard
on INN yesterday there's a new repot that says 10 million female fetuses
have been aborted or newborn baby girls killed--mostly by being buried alive
or by having sand etc poured into their noses. or abt govt violence in latin
america.
if left-wing has something to do w/ believing that every human being has
human rights & must be fed & given opportunities than let's think abt the
75% of the hungry people in this world who are women and children. how many
jews are there in the world-- to be blamed for so many problems!
of course israel has done awful things, and peace is finally the only answer
and of course war kills the innocent--now 80-85% of people killed in wars
are civilians--those who are the victims of the very regime the others are
trying to overthrow. and regimes that take over through violence usually
turn into tyrannical govts. ok, I realize I'm lecturing and over the
top--better stop drinking coffee for awhile & get back to work--but to be a
left-wing jew in the US these days is to see some contradictions.

In McLeod Ganj, hill station in lap of Himalaya,
during most recent war between Lebanon and Israel,
where the Lebanese were smashed, young Israelis, these
ancient hills considered most holy by Hindus, spotted
with New Age Israeli settlements (which, incidentally,
are very much exclusive and tend towards unfriendly),
were heard drinking and cheering among a majority
community dominated by Buddhists, Hindus, and Muslims
(Pakistan and Kashmir just round the corner). Of
course, this added to resentment.

And to think that the US government was until recently
funding, perhaps unknowingly, what has been described
as 'little floridas' out there in the desert -
Americans of Jewish descent returning to Israel with
baby and submachine gun in hand (as has been depicted
on Israeli TV, I am told, quite often - my source a
soldier in the Israeli army, and we drank and smoke
chillums up there among sweet water pools).

Woman beaten on Jerusalem bus for refusing to move to
rear seat

By Daphna Berman

A woman who reported a vicious attack by an ad-hoc
"modesty patrol" on a Jerusalem bus last month is now
lining up support for her case and may be included in
a petition to the High Court of Justice over the
legality of sex-segregated buses.

Miriam Shear says she was traveling to pray at the
Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City early on November
24 when a group of ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) men
attacked her for refusing to move to the back of the
Egged No. 2 bus. She is now in touch with several
legal advocacy and women's organizations, and at the
same time, waiting for the police to apprehend her
attackers.

In her first interview since the incident, Shear says
that on the bus three weeks ago, she was slapped,
kicked, punched and pushed by a group of men who
demanded that she sit in the back of the bus with the
other women. The bus driver, in response to a media
inquiry, denied that violence was used against her,
but Shear's account has been substantiated by an
unrelated eyewitness on the bus who confirmed that she
sustained an unprovoked "severe beating."

Shear, an American-Israeli woman who currently lives
in Canada, says that on a recent five-week vacation to
Israel, she rode the bus daily to the Old City to pray
at sunrise. Though not defined by Egged as a
sex-segregated "mehadrin" bus, women usually sit in
the back, while men sit in the front, as a matter of
custom.

"Every two or three days, someone would tell me to sit
in the back, sometimes politely and sometimes not,"
she recalled this week in a telephone interview. "I
was always polite and said 'No. This is not a
synagogue. I am not going to sit in the back.'"

But Shear, a 50-year-old religious woman, says that on
the morning of the 24th, a man got onto the bus and
demanded her seat - even though there were a number of
other seats available in the front of the bus.

"I said, I'm not moving and he said, 'I'm not asking
you, I'm telling you.' Then he spat in my face and at
that point, I was in high adrenaline mode and called
him a son-of-a-bitch, which I am not proud of. Then I
spat back. At that point, he pushed me down and people
on the bus were screaming that I was crazy. Four men
surrounded me and slapped my face, punched me in the
chest, pulled at my clothes, beat me, kicked me. My
snood [hair covering] came off. I was fighting back
and kicked one of the men in his privates. I will
never forget the look on his face."

Shear says that when she bent down in the aisle to
retrieve her hair covering, "one of the men kicked me
in the face. Thank God he missed my eye. I got up and
punched him. I said, 'I want my hair covering back'
but he wouldn't give it to me, so I took his black hat
and threw it in the aisle."

'Stupid American'

Throughout the encounter, Shear says the bus driver
"did nothing." The other passengers, she says, blamed
her for not moving to the back of the bus and called
her a "stupid American with no sechel [common sense.]
People blamed me for not knowing my place and not
going to the back of the bus where I belong."

According to Yehoshua Meyer, the eyewitness to the
incident, Shear's account is entirely accurate. "I saw
everything," he said. "Someone got on the bus and
demanded that she go to the back, but she didn't
agree. She was badly beaten and her whole body
sustained hits and kicks. She tried to fight back and
no one would help her. I tried to help, but someone
was stopping me from getting up. My phone's battery
was dead, so I couldn't call the police. I yelled for
the bus driver to stop. He stopped once, but he didn't
do anything. When we finally got to the Kotel [Western
Wall], she was beaten badly and I helped her go to the
police."

Shear says that when she first started riding the No.
2 line, she did not even know that it was sometimes
sex-segregated. She also says that sitting in the
front is simply more comfortable. "I'm a 50-year-old
woman and I don't like to sit in the back. I'm dressed
appropriately and I was on a public bus."

"It is very dangerous for a group of people to take
control over a public entity and enforce their will
without going through due process," she said. "Even if
they [Haredim who want a segregated bus] are a
majority - and I don't think they are - they have
options available. They can petition Egged or hire
their own private line. But as long as it's a public
bus, I don't care if there are 500 people telling me
where to sit. I can sit wherever I want and so can
anyone else."

Meyer says that throughout the incident, the other
passengers blamed Shear for not sitting in the back.
"They'll probably claim that she attacked them first,
but that's totally untrue. She was abused terribly,
and I've never seen anything like it."

Word of Shear's story traveled quickly after she
forwarded an e-mail detailing her experience. She has
been contacted by a number of groups, including
Shatil, the New Israel Fund's Empowerment and Training
Center for Social Change; Kolech, a religious women's
forum; the Israel Religious Action Center (IRAC), the
legal advocacy arm of the local Reform movement; and
the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance (JOFA).

In the coming month, IRAC will be submitting a
petition to the High Court of Justice against the
Transportation Ministry over the issue of segregated
Egged buses. IRAC attorney Orly Erez-Likhovski is in
touch with Shear and is considering including her in
the petition.

Although the No. 2 Jerusalem bus where the incident
occurred is not actually defined as a mehadrin line,
Erez-Likhovski says that Shear's story is further
proof that the issue requires legal clarification.
About 30 Egged buses are designated as mehadrin,
mostly on inter-city lines, but they are not marked to
indicate this. "There's no way to identify a mehadrin
bus, which in itself is a problem," she said.

"Theoretically, a person can sit wherever they want,
even on a mehadrin line, but we're seeing that people
are enforcing [the gender segregation] even on
non-mehadrin lines and that's the part of the danger,"
she said.

On a mehadrin bus, women enter and exit through the
rear door, and the seats from the rear door back are
generally considered the "women's section." A child is
usually sent forward to pay the driver.

The official responses

In a response from Egged, the bus driver denied that
Shear was physically attacked in any way.

"In a thorough inquiry that we conducted, we found
that the bus driver does not confirm that any violence
was used against the complainant," Egged spokesman Ron
Ratner wrote.

"According to the driver, once he saw that there was a
crowd gathering around her, he stopped the bus and
went to check what was going on. He clarified to the
passengers that the bus was not a mehadrin line and
that all passengers on the line are permitted to sit
wherever they want on the bus. After making sure that
the passengers returned to their seats, he continued
driving."

The Egged response also noted that their drivers "are
not able and are not authorized to supervise the
behavior of the passengers in all situations."

Ministry of Transportation spokesperson Avner Ovadia
said in response that the mehadrin lines are "the
result of agreements reached between Egged and Haredi
bodies" and are therefore unconnected to the ministry.


A spokesperson for the Jerusalem police said the case
is still under investigation.

The most interesting thing to me about Ron Silliman's inclusion of Ted Berrigan as a practitioner of "the cut-up."  Although I knew/have known Ted and his work for many years it never occurred to me that his poems, which quote liberally from sources ranging from Shakespeare to John Ashbery that these sonnets and poems which do that were cut-ups. It's an interesting perspective and may help me teach Ted's poems in the spring at The Poetry Project.

I've been playing with doing textual cutup using recordings of text for a while, and then transcribing the results back to text. one thing i've noticed about that process is that there are what i've taken to calling 'translation errors' in the cutup process. Places where, as the words are recombined, new words seem to be suggested. it's even more pronounced working in sound rather than print, because there aren't the visual cues to suggest the boundaries of words.

just my $.02

the language game and "meaning as use" are close allies in Wittgenstein's later thought. He relied on both very heavily, particularly in the Blue and Brown Books. By the last redacting of Philosophical Investigations, he'd, I think, come to the conclusion that laying out language games and "meaning as use" as theoretical devices was an inherently flawed philosophical method that would only lead to more confusion. (On that note, I think he was right as I think the case of Richard Rorty's reading of Wittgenstein illustrates.)

For references, I don't remember the paragraph number off hand, but there's a comment early in PI that reads "For a large number of cases, though not for all, the meaning of a word is it's use in a language game."

I'm quoting from memory, so it might be slightly different, but I'm pretty sure it comes in the first third of PI right around the repudiation of the picture theory and after the championing of vagueness, if you want to look it up.

There are also a lot of admonitions in particularly his lectures on aesthetics and ethics and the remarks on the foundations of mathematics to "look to how a word is used." when it seems to create a philosophical problem. Zettel's discussion of "intention" i think demonstrates the sort of analysis he was thinking about in those comments.

stanfords internet encyclopedia of philosophy has a good article on it, although it's a bit technical.
http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience/#2.1
Wikipedia is a bit less dry, but also a lot less coherent
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervenience

It's a word that originally comes from a particular school of thought in early 20th c. philosophy philosophy of mind, but it get's used all over the place now a days, i've encountered it mostly in metaphysics and ethics.


Hope that's helpful!

Here's a thought, and I really do hope nobody takes this as raining
on anybody's parade, esp. in light of the effort it takes to pull
this kind of thing together:

Why can't 60+ poets get together just to jaw, as opposed to reading
to one another?  I'm puzzled by this, and have been for years now.  I
show up every year, I listen, I try to eek out a few words under my
breath to someone I haven't seen in months or years, someone who's
doing likewise.  Often we talk -- whisper, gesture -- about how nice
it would be just to shoot the shit, and often we pretend to pay
attention, esp. as the evening wears on.

Now that's just me.  I like to gab.  I don't like readings with 60+
people.  Aldon -- someone with whom I would like to shoot the shit at
said reading -- thinks it's fun.  I don't think it's fun -- I think
it's something of a drag, in fact, b/c there are so many people that
I won't otherwise have a chance to talk to, given the dynamics of
MLA.  So I always leave said reading feeling like it's a missed
opportunity.  It's certainly not the note I'd like to see my MLA
experience conclude on.  I'd much rather be, well, gabbing.

Again, not to rain on anyone's parade.  I don't wish to come off as
even a little bit cranky.  I'm just suggesting something that I've
suggested to any number of individuals (i.e., participating poets)
for years now, generally (generally) to nods of agreement.  And yet
here we all are, talking about that MLA group reading again.

Best,

Joe

i actually love the soundbite nature of the mega-readings.
everything's sweet n short; if someone's boring, they're only boring
for 2 minutes. and if someone's great, you know enough to know that,
to pursue their work and to tell them how great they were.  of course
i like talking too.  i like sitting w/ folks i can kibbitz with sotto
voce. last time in philly i sat on the couch w/ lee ann brown, who
was breast-feeding, and juliana spahr, who was knitting.  i was
x-stitching. we were, like, the 1970s contingent, with our long hair
to boot.

I like it, too, Peter. One suggestion - why not blur the incised words on
the tablet. Even if ironic, it makes the piece a bit preachy for me. Where I
think the messenger's bloodied body - strangled by chaotic (destroyed)
script is plenty adequate re 'the statement'.

G Bush - tho apparently still clueless - wrapped and not yet fully strangled
in his own script makes good mirror.  Trouble being we -this country - is
spiraling down with him.

The military is not the only thing stretched too thin  - maybe we should
talk 'moral fiber', big time.

On the dark side of the solstice!

Joe, I often wonder the same thing.  However, many poets will not attend
such an event if they aren't given a bit of stage time. I wonder, if the
list were cut down to thirty, how many of the eliminated poets would even
show up. Poets, in my experience, prefer being showcased to merely listening
or hanging out. The irony, as noted recently on this list, is that their
audience is mostly other poets.

I think it would be funny to come to a reading like this, read your 2
minutes, then immediately leave. Wouldn't that be rude??  It would also be
funny to stand up and say, "I'm passing my two minutes to Susan Schultz.
Let her read for four!! Her new stuff is phenomenal!" And sit back down. Of
course that would never happen.

Okay, wait-- I challenge one of the Nifty Sixty to pass their minutes to
another poet. I'll buy that poet's alcohol for the rest of the night. This
is a real offer. Email me if your interested.

In any case, i'll be there, and I'd love to chat with you again--

during burroughs's time, for the most part, 'programming' had more or less
thoroughly sinister connotations. 'programming' was something they did. to
us. mind control. mainframe computers in government and corporate labs
shaping mindframe. framing. main. mind. control. programming the colossus.
the man. the machine. the man's machine.

but with the spread of personal computers, the internet, and many people
driving computers like mindbats through satellite data storms, maybe
attitudes have changed toward 'programming'. i make 'software art'. my
attitude toward programming is that it is a written thing i and others
create that operates in the world just as poetry does. i think of it as a
literary creation. and an architectural creation. a hybrid of engineering
and art, of art and science, of visual and textual, of audio and
interactivity.

on a different but related topic, the stupifying popularity of roger
penrose's fallacious 'proofs' that there are thought processes of which
humans are capable and computers are not testifies to the depth of the
widespread desire to establish that the mind is not only superior now to any
machine but must forever be.

the reaction is similar to how people reacted--some still do--to darwin's
theory that we evolved from the simplest of life-forms: fear and disbelief.
but we have had 150 years to think about it, and the enlightened approach is
that we are not diminished by darwin's theory of evolution. not one bit. the
same is true of the idea that the mind is fundamentally software in a
wetware brain/body. we simply now have the beginnings to understand the mind
more deeply than we did before, and still have a long way to go. we do not
yet even understand the mechanisms by which memories are stored and
retrieved by the brain. when we do, that will be an achievement on the order
of darwin's theory and the discovery of dna.

so don't cry, heidi. the idea that our minds are information processing
systems that operate in ways we are not millenia from understanding is
exciting, surely, and offers us the possibility of deeper understanding of
ourselves, our fellow humans and other animals. and i can't help but think
that the study of language will be crucial here, also--we will understand
language in a more general sense than we do now, along at least one more
dimension. we can't be diminished by self understanding, in the end.

Free Minds, Free People
Deadline: January 30, 2007

A conference taking place in Chicago Thursday, June 21
to Sunday, June 24, 2007 will bring together teachers,
youth, parents, researchers and community-based
educators from across the country to begin building a
movement to develop and promote Education for
Liberation.

Education for Liberation is an umbrella term we use to
describe the work of people who are trying to link
education, social justice and activism. Other more
common terms are popular education, social justice
education, survival schools or Freedom Schools. The
conference will take place at the new social justice
Little Village High School.

Conference organizers are seeking individuals and
organizations who would like to plan and facilitate
discussions, panels, workshops, demonstrations and/or
activities that will help develop our understanding
and practice of Education for Liberation. Your
proposed activity should be designed to last
approximately one and a half hours. They are aiming
for a diverse audience and a wide variety of
conference activities.

This conference is sponsored by The Chicago Freedom
School Project, the Education for Liberation Network,
The Brotherhood/Sister Sol and the University of
Chicago's Center for Urban School Improvement.

E-mail freeminds@Brotherhood-Sistersol.org for
information on guidelines to submit your proposal.

a couple quick observations --

first of all, since when does Joe Amatao not want to come off as even a little bit cranky?  Say it ain't so, Joe!  We wouldn't have you any other way --

a few years ago at one of these mass readings in D.C., Rosmarie Waldrop demonstrated just the sort of generosity with time Aaron suggested -- She was the subject of an MLA panel that year, she explained, so she was relinquishing some of her time at the reading in favor of the rest of the poets.

Then too, there is usually somebody who has to be reminded that the time was up some time ago -- I hope that won't be me this year --

yes, it would be rude to leave right after your own reading -- it would be rude to skip ALL the poets before you -- in most years, it's seemed to me, people come & go as at a new music festival-- yes, it would be great if we all had more time to visit -- many of us will find time to visit a bit at MLA itself -- but I still think it's a great thing for all of us to show up and relish our numbers, even in an MLA year like this one that gives more attention to poetry than usual --

Just out of curiosity, and because I have never bothered to read penrose because i have my own set of reasons for disbelieving in strong AI that have nothing to do with physics, my understanding is that penrose's argument isn't that we can't give machines consciousness, but that it isn't possible to give machines consciousness using algorithms. Is that correct? And if so, it seems like a plausible position to me that works along the same lines as searle's difficult to get out from under Chinese Room thought experiment.

I find all this stuff really interesting.

I think machine consciousness will be superior to human.   Humans can
only seem to imagine machine consciousness as it pertains to their own
place in the class system, ergo, their personal PHILOSOPHY.  How would
an autonomous machine consciousness need any social stratification?

The book I keep mentioning, "Engines of Logic" by Martin Davis--who is an
emminent USAmerican logician, by the way--ends with a chapter on how
Penrose's arguments are fallacious.

Some of the prettiest work in the theory of computation establishes that
there exist some tasks for which no algorithm can be devised. The classic
example is called 'the halting problem'. Google that and you'll get a gaggle
of results.

So Penrose sets out to prove that there are some thought processes of which
humans are capable but for which no algorithm can be devised. If no
algorithm can be devised for a task or process, then the task or process
cannot be carried out on a computer because all that can be done with
computers is expressable in terms of algorithms.

I know it takes effort to ignore somebody, but will anyone agree that
the great flaw of human consciousness is a self-perpetuating need for
social stratification to acquire knowledge?  Does machine consciousness
mean the end of privilege?  Is that the fear?   The bourgeois will fear
nothing more than losing his social privilege.  The bourgeois will tell
you straight-faced that she "chose" her parents.  Does that not express
a terrible fear of losing one's privilege?  To imagine machine
consciousness is to imagine the loss of one's own privilege, & ergo, to
imagine being SLAVE to that consciousness, as it were.  Pretty
terrifying, huh?   Like falling off the edge of the earth.

Admittedly, I've only just read the Chinese room thought experiment, and
let me say, I'm nearly laughing !  Searle must think very highly of
hisself, if he thinks he could process Chinese faster than Deep Blue,
which, I add, Kasparov claimed played a move "too human" to be computed,
and that was a decade ago.  The greatest chess mind ever, famed for his
infinitely subtle play!  How is the Chinese Room thought experiment
"difficult" at all, when considering for advancement in computational
speeds?  The human mind processes "language symbols" at, we can
practically state, at near light speed.  When machines can do this, they
will be conscious.  The Chinese Room thought experiment is quite silly,
in my opinion.  On the other side, you have the notion of STRONG
artificial intelligence.  Why do we say "strong," when we could say
practical or even, to be simple, good?  Because a statement of
"strength" is a roundabout way of claiming absolute dominion by a
particular sphere of privilege and influence.  Very intelligent human
beings are often pitiably weak.  Would you say their minds are strong,
because they can recite some Chaucer over a bottle of cheap scotch, or
go into greater detail of the Chinese Room thought experiment---?
Idano, I'm just saying...

This seems to me to misunderstand the problem entirely. Speed is not
the issue in the Chinese Room thought experiment. The question is
whether the mono-lingual speaker of English in the room, who doesn't
know any Chinese, but who is given the books and rules necessary to
correlate Chinese symbols with each other, who then produces
responses in Chinese characters to inputs in Chinese characters
without any other help that Chinese speakers accept as Chinese, can
be said to understand Chinese. Searle's answer is that the
monolingual English speaker in the box, manipulating correlations of
symbols he doesn't understand the meanings of, doesn't himself
understand Chinese, even though people outside the box who are
submitting Chinese questions and getting Chinese answers might say
that the box understands Chinese. Speed is not the issue; whether
people outside the box say the box understands Chinese while we know
that the person inside the box does NOT understand Chinese
constitutes the criticism of "strong AI", because it means that a
computer, which is after all a box for manipulating symbols, doesn't
understand the meaning or significance of its symbol manipulation; it
just does it.

Makes me think, and not being difficult, of someone
trying to say why it is that we play baseball -
without understanding that our folksiness (and the
Irish working class) so folksy - and I have learned to
appreciate this aspect of our democracy, perhaps the
root of European resentment, so prefered rounders to,
well, cricket!

Yes, when I can compute Chinese fast enough to convince a native speaker
of the language that I knows Chinese, I in fact can then be said to
understand the language.   Yeah, I had foregone that point.

And this admirably clear paraphrase shows why Searle's thought
experiment is misguided: it confuses the speaker within the room with
the mind that understands Chinese.  Presumably Searle would not require
individual neurons involved in language processing, or even brain
structures involved in language processing, to understand a language,
yet this is precisely the role played by the mono-lingual speaker in the
room.  If the room is successfully responding to Chinese, then the *room
as a whole*, not the speaker looking up symbols, must understand Chinese.

Here is an exceptional site in literary new media:
http://dreamingmethods.com by Andy Campbell from the UK.

I have yet to explore this site as thoroughly as I believe it deserves but
have, so far, spent about an hour perusing several works. They're the sort
of works that require multiple viewings/readings. You glimpse, initially.
And you're not quite sure what you're glimpsing.

The pieces are, in some sense, made of glimpses. They involve elements of
narrative but do not seem to have the full meal deal concerning story. They
glimpse into story. Are tantalizing in that one wonders what they add up to
and how deeply one can go in such directions.

These are works created, in part, with Flash. They are distinctively visual.
Somewhat cinematic. Interactive. Textual. Atmospherically sonic. Dark and
brooding.

"Surface" is described as "A matrix of memories, fragmented thoughts,
animated scribbles, poetry and narratives from a protagonist who has burned
every last one of his material belongings." The synopsis of another is this:
"Living alone and secluded, an elderly man keeps a surreal record of his
dreams as he is slowly poisoned by his gas fire leaking carbon monoxide."

I appreciate the way Campbell is working integrally with text, image, sound,
interactivity/interface, fiction, poetry, the cinematic, and the overall
notion of the site as literary work. Integrally and also centrally with
incompleteness. All of the pieces are fragmentary. Glimpsing.

Campbell himself describes the site like this:

"Dreaming Methods projects are created as an exploration into innovative new
approaches to writing. They use the unique potential of the internet and
multimedia to blend unusual, creative narratives with other art forms.
These works are not "e-books" or hypertext sites in the traditional sense,
nor do they adhere to the usual styles and standards incorporated into
"quality" Flash sites. The aim of Digital Fiction is to use Flash to create
interesting ways of telling stories and creating abstract narratives; to
offer a blend of challenging writing, entertainment and interaction."

"Digital Fiction as a reading experience offers a purposely, almost
naturally, fragmented narrative; sentences, happenings, cut off as though
erased, re-emerge elsewhere; complex text animations allow only random
fleeting glimpses of what is or what might be going on; the choice is yours
not only in which direction you click or scroll - but in which direction you
allow the narrative to take you. Or, in which direction you wish to take the
narrative."

Let's pat each other on the back for what "we know."  You question
*understanding* and not what it means to process instructions.
Understanding is often a function of privilege; for instance, you're
more likely to be understanding and compassionate towards somebody you
perceive to be within your social milieu, & behave somewhat more
dispassionately towards another who is perceived to be either above or
below or outside your station.  Then it's convenient for each party to
claim "a misunderstanding."

Say I point you to the Application Programming Interface of Java, & tell
you to make a program that outputs "Hello, world."  It would take you
quite a while, given only the API, and no prior knowledge, to make that
program.  But after six months you could write much more complex
programs, possibly convince an employer to hire you, with nothing but
your smarts and the API.  You will know how write efficient Java code, &
what will you say when I ask, "Do you understand Java?"  You will say yes.

So there are degrees of understanding.  It shouldn't be relevant what
the observer may or may not know.  Understanding is understood in
different ways.

Not only is speed is not the issue, speed has NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
The question is whether a monolingual English speaker who is given
rules for manipulating Chinese characters and who does manipulate the
Chinese characters in response to other Chinese characters so that a
Chinese speaker accepts the answers as given by a Chinese speaker,
can that monolingual English speaker be said to understand Chinese?

Yes, this was also my impression of Searle's argument.

I note that Martin Davis in "Engines of Logic" discusses Searle's argument
and says much the same as you, Wes.

Another elitism:  to respond, "yes, the computer understands the
language," means I don't understand the question.

That reinforces most of the points I've made, foremost one's fear of
losing his "privileged observer" status.

Pee soup is off the menu as China makes its English more savoury

By Clifford Coonan in Beijing

Published: 21 December 2006

http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article2091871.ece

"Complicated cake", "pee soup", "five sliced things", "dumpling
stuffed with the ovary and digestive glands of a crab" and,
hopefully, "crap in the grass" are being banished from Beijing's
restaurants - as part of a plan to improve English spelling and
standardise signs and menus for the 2008 Olympics.

One of the many joys of eating out in China is the linguistic
richness of the English menus - the misspelling of carp will always
raise a giggle.

But chefs still favour direct translations from Chinese, or rather
prosaic descriptions of the food on offer, and there are wonderful
examples of garbled English all around the capital. Among this
correspondent's favourites is "fuck the certain price of goods" - far
more striking than "sale now on," while "children is not recommended"
has a certain elegance."Enter the mouth", a mistranslation of the
Chinese characters for "entrance" is also common on signposts.

The messages can range from the linguistically marvellous to the
plain baffling. The spa in my apartment building promises a "babble
bath", while in the Starbucks outlet at the airport you could buy a
"fresh fruit howl" instead of a fruit bowl. Property advertisements
are particularly prone, such as the skyscraper sold as "a wonder of
national cream".

There are good intentions behind trying to put road signs in English
as well as Chinese, and generally the road signs are very accurate.
However, some safety signs can be truly magnificent: "No blowing of
horn. Keep silence!" or "notice the rockslide, please is run about by
cliff".

Eager to avoid red faces ahead of the Olympics, the Chinese
government has set up a major drive to standardise the use of English
in public, called the "Beijing speaks to the world committee," which
scours the capital seeking out menus or road signs lost in
mistranslation. It has finished translating more than 1,000 dishes
and drinks so far. "We welcome public participation and suggestions,"
the committee told the Beijing Daily.

Some 300 million people are learning English in China, and the
standard has improved dramatically in recent years, which means fewer
howlers like those listed above. But I will always recall landing in
Kunming airport in Yunnan province in the 1990s to see a sign
reading: "We welcome our foreign fiends." A mistake, surely.

PennSound has recently put up an mp3 of the 2004 Philadelphia MLA
offsite reading:
http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/MLA-Offsite.html
We've broken the reading into two one-hour MP3s. Any additional info
on what poems were read would be appreciated: so far, only sketchy
info is provided.

Note that many of the poets at the reading are not associated with
the MLA; these off-site readings have always been a way for local
poets to read together with those in from out-of-town.

i love these. my fave is one i spotted in an out-of-the-way
vietnamese restaurant in north minneapolis: baloney with mussels.
they meant abalone.  another fave is the ubiquitous "noddles."  one
place had an entire menu section entitled "fun with noddles."

Hi Joe----I felt something similar last time I went to an MLA thing
(in Philly, 2 years ago) and when it was my turn to read, instead I
just started talking to and/or about the previous poets I met and
knew and read before. I didn't get to mention everybody, and the
"price" one pays for this sometimes is not being taken as "seriously"
as a poet (being "too much" the "mere entertainer" as if poetry
readings are 'above that' like the white catholic church of my youth,
etc), but it felt like the right thing to do, and seemed worth it...a
candle lit (disguised as a curse), etc....

anyway, just wanted to say I'm glad you're thinking about this. i
find it playful rather than cranky, but then again alot of my
thoughts about the basic status quo notion of poetry readings often
fall on deaf ears and get called 'cranky' so feel free to ignore what
i say...

happy darkest day of the year to those in the northern hemisphere

I have not seen anyone mention this--

  &#8213;for immediate release—
  http://www.thetemplebookstore.com/bukcd.html

              A new CD of a vintage reading (1974) by world famous twentieth century American poet Charles Bukowski (1922-1993) is one you’ll have to stuff in your CD player as soon as you get it. In 1974, the intrepid Bukowski journeyed from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City to give a featured reading at the Underwater Poetry Festival, along with Alta, Ricardo Sanchez, and Andy Clausen. The recording of the reading given in the social work auditorium of the University of Utah survived in the archives of the Reverend Sherm W. Clow, President at the time of the renowned Litmus Inc., producer of the festival, and is made available to the general public by The Temple Inc. of Walla Walla , Washington . Litmus Inc. was the publisher back in the day of the classic Bukowski book, Poems Written Before Jumping out of an 8 Story Window.
              More than twenty poems with a table of contents, some introductory and closing patter by MC Charles Potts, and a reproduction of the poster from the UPF are the menu on the CD. Bukowski was just beginning to achieve the lasting fame that would come to him in the next two decades. Hear the man at his droll and noteworthy best. The CD is available from The Temple Inc., CD baby, and if you’re lucky or live where hip book and music stores abound, from your local dealer. Don’t be satisfied with a single copy when you can buy two or more and give them to worthy friends. Friends don’t let friends drive with Bukowski.

Chris, Aaron, Charles, Maria, others -- thanks for your thoughts...

At the expense of appearing something like a Menshevik about this, I
still hold that getting together needs no justification.  Sure, it's
nice to hear someone read.  But hearing 60+ people read?  And what IS
the proper etiquette here, anyway?  You listen to the ten readers
before you and the ten after you, then you're free to leave?  Or are
you stuck for the duration, etiquette wise?  This assumes, of course,
that you really don't WANT to hear 60+ poets read... not least b/c
your feet might get sore (the last reading at Philly, I stood through
90 minutes of the event).

Maria, I take your point.  But as I'm not an x-stitcher, a knitter,
or a breast-feeder, this leaves me with only a few options.  Perhaps
I need more hobbies?  I could solve crossword puzzles, but I'm not
into crossword puzzles.  I could read, but that might be rude.  I
could ponder my prior three days at MLA -- doubtless part of what
I'll be doing, if I attend, much as I'll be managing half-hushed
exchanges.  I could try poet-spotting (that takes you only so far
into the evening).  If I were a reader at such an event, I could try
to think about what I'll be reading, then try to think about what
I've read.

I'm not real happy, for that matter, with readers who can't seem to
comprehend what a time allotment is, esp. in the midst of a group
reading.  But we've aired that one out here before.  I get esp.
annoyed at "Do I have time to read another poem?"  I answered that
question here on the ISU campus a couple of weeks ago, overseeing a
student reading.  And I think you all know what my answer was.

Anyway.  I guess I've said what I have to say about this.  It reminds
me of my bar days.   When we used to go to a bar with live
entertainment, we generally had a choice:  either listen up-close to
the live entertainment, or retreat to a spot in the bar where
conversation was possible.  More difficult when the background
"music" is poetry, maybe, and you'd need a space to accommodate such
a division of, uhm, labor.  But that's all I can offer by way of a
remedy to a problem that only a few, evidently, feel is a problem.

And hey -- If I do end up at the reading this year, please be sure to
say hi.  I promise to try to have a good time...

Best,

Joe

Which is one response that defenders of Strong AI often give to the Chinese Room argument. It's common enough that it's known as the "Systems Reply," that is, the subject is the whole system, not the man in the room, and the system is able understand Chinese. It's a point with some force. My problem with it is that I don't think it's sensible to say a system understands anything. Searle's response is to say eliminate the room, have the guy in the room internalize all of the symbols and the rules for the script, memorize it all, and he still doesn't know what the symbols mean.

I think the point of the entire thought experiment, however, doesn't really get at the idea of artificial intelligence, so much as it shows how artificial intelligence conceived of as a form of Turing machine and validated through a Turing test isn't the same thing as what we think of as animal intelligence.

Personally, i don't think machine intelligence will ever be equivalent to animal intelligence. Machine's are not alive, and intelligence is a by product of an animals form of life. If we could make Machine's do something that looked an awful lot like what we call thinking when we do it, I don't think that we could rightly say the machines were thinking. What they were doing would be something altogether new and different.

Jesse,

I see that Marcus has already addressed what appears to be your confusion about the target of the thought experiment, and i'll leave it at that as I don't have much more to say about the subject, really, since I don't agree that Strong AI is ruled out by the chinese room, just that thought is not equivalent to calculation, and therefore can't be done by digital computers. That's the part that's difficult for defenders of strong AI and the only objections I've seen to it are arguments from implication, that is, arguments from people who want to show that there are implications to accepting that thought isn't computation that people who want to accept the Chinese Room argument might not want to accept along with it. Personally, i don't have much of a problem biting the bullet of dualism if it's truly necessary, so that doesn't bother me at all.


What I did want to address, though, were your comments about strong AI. Strong AI is called strong AI in order to contrast it with weak AI. It's terminology that's used all over in the debates about artificial intelligence and the terms are used sensibly in that Strong AI is called strong AI because it makes a stronger claim, ie that machines can be programmed to think and be self-aware and have intentions, than the claim made by weak Ai, which is that machines can be programmed to solve problems and reason within a domain. Deep Blue is an example of Weak AI, because it's capable of sophisticated problem solving strategies, but it isn't aware of itself and is not conscious of what or why it's doing things. weak AI can be accomplished using algorithms, and the thrust of the Chinese Room is that strong AI cannot. I just want to make the point that your comment about claiming dominion by calling
it strong ai is missing the mark. what's in question isn't the strength of the machine, but the strength of the claim about what a machine might be capable of. human beings don't have artificial intelligence, strong or weak. they have animal intelligence. To my way of thinking, the very idea of artificial intelligence is merely propagated by taking the synechdoche of the turing machine over literally. Because human minds can do what turing machines do, it doesn't follow that human minds are only capable of what turing machines are, nor that they do the things in the same way, nor that that output is what matters and is more important than the process by which that output is reached, which are all claims made by Strong AI.

      ...with blur for a head. Torrents churn beneath the architecture, which has become a neutral word for me, and denotes all this scaffolding crashing down around my bare ankles. One pill wakes my ass up and sets me to thinking. Donald Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, Vol I II III IV. I'm trying to accept everyone for who they are, and not for what I feel they could be if they weren't so damned stupid. Poems are no different than eating, sleeping, discarding of waste by-products (shit, piss, but not semen, semen isn't waste). I save them in a jar behind the door, Eleanor Rigby! I've never understood their precocity. But for the most part I feel that my life has passed beneath streetlamps, somewhere in the menagerie mash-up of Lorain's drunk streets, mistaken by passersby for a girl because my hair is long, because I stumble blurting poetry or I stumble bleeding pictures. I think the males' heads fill up with nitrous oxide at age 13, and don't deflate until they're
 30. No doubt, this can be deconstructed. Flies on a rail. The flood of flower rouge, of funky latitudes engaging jasmine sacrilige, jiggy with it at last! The work of the Damned...

Dec. 15th, 7 p.m. at the Wordpainting & Paper Kite Press Studio was
Poetry Prom Night. Participants were encouraged to being the absolute
worst of their high school poems.

Bad high school poems were read, punch was swilled, dress was creative
formal, portraits were taken, and the music was the stuff you WANTED
at your prom but didn't get. A good time was had by all.

Pretend you attended, 29 photos at:

This is all really interesting to me, and has been for quite a while...

I think the approach I prefer most is the sort of thing one finds in
Lyotard's The Inhuman.  In a lot of ways the core question is how
we're to evaluate behavior.  If something behaves as if it's
thinking, do we attribute thought to it?  Moreover, if something
behaves as if it thinks it's thinking, do we attribute thought to it?
Or, can we imagine conditions such that we would so attribute?

And then of course we have this question of feelings.  If something
behaves as if it's grieving, do we treat it as if it's grieving?
This may seem a stretch, but (after Lyotard) this kind of inquiry has
a certain heuristic value, at the very least, leading us to consider
what emotions we find valuable, and why.

And if we're not all underwater in 1000 years, I've little doubt that
the behavior of machines (artificial life etc.) will be such that
machine behavior will continue to blur the distinctions at stake
between human and machine, animate and inanimate, etc.

It might be unsettling to think so, but I'm not sure how this is to be avoided.

Best,

Joe

I know the contrast between animal intelligence and artificial
intelligence.  I don't mistake "artificial" for "surrogate," I'm just
very interested by "thinking machines" & their potential more than
having their boundaries delimited before they're conceived.  The Chinese
Room experiment I did take a bit out of context to state that the
problem of "understanding" is related to various "systems" within animal
intelligence, class-consciousness foremost, to my mind. And there was an
active part to confuse my main points there, all of which have been
neatly avoided.  The notion I offer is that it's possibly beyond our
comprehension the future of artificial intelligence, & by comparing it
to "the earth is flat" in context of social stratification I attempted
to formulate "unique" vantage.  In short, I take the side of magical
thinking, and I really see it strange to using subjective notions of
human understanding to scale the machine's intelligence to our own.  It
is ego-centric.  If I was confused, it was on the aspect of the person
being inside the computer, or room, and there being a separate computer
doing the same thing.  To me, if the computer can relay cogent language
and "communicate" practically with a human speaker, and that if a person
"in the next computer" does as well as the computer itself, I will say
yes, the computer "understands" the language in all practicality, yet
it's not the right word, and ALSO the person who is ( you'll admit,
magically ) using all manner of instruction to parallel the computer's
ability, then yes, I say that person passes for understanding of the
language, when you take the instructions as metaphor for the animal
process by which the speaker speaks, which I do, & which we should.
That, to me, is a major point being foregone by the arguments here.  On
the one hand is the "privileged observer" who's authorized to state yay
or nay at the person's understanding of the language, & on the other
hand you have the notion of a person using a "mere set of instructions"
to employ decent conversation with another human being.  I have to
emphasize moreover that it's a magical, superhuman notion, yet the
privileged observer is "just a cold fact" who to my observation is
granted excessive credence throughout these arguments.  I'll take the
magical thinking.

The WordTemple Poetry Series will celebrate the beginning of its second year
on Friday, January 12, 2007 by featuring Michael McClure and Michael
Rothenberg.  Refreshments will be provided as part of the celebration so
come early, and please spread the word!





Michael McClure and Michael Rothenberg

Friday, January 12, 2007 - 7 p.m.

Copperfield's Books, 2316 Montgomery Dr., Santa Rosa





Michael McClure is famous for his dynamic poetry performances. Author of
Rain Mirror, Touching the Edge: Dharma Devotions from the Hummingbird
Sangha, and Huge Dreams, McClure has given hundreds of readings from the
legendary Six Gallery in San Francisco (with Allen Ginsberg) to the Library
of Congress. Recently, McClure joined with composer Terry Riley to create a
CD titled I Like Your Eyes Liberty, a stunning exploration of music and
voice. A musician and playwright, as well as a poet -- McClure's songs
include "Mercedes Benz" popularized by Janis Joplin.



Michael Rothenberg's books include The Paris Journals, Monk Daddy and
Unhurried Vision. He is editor and publisher of Big Bridge (
<http://www.bigbridge.org/> www.bigbridge.org), the editor of Overtime,
Selected Poems by Philip Whalen, As Ever, Selected Poems by Joanne Kyger,
and David's Copy, Selected Poems by David Meltzer.  Rothenberg's readings
are stunning for their wide range of experience and emotion.  David Meltzer
calls Unhurried Vision a "deeply stirred & stirring affirmation of poetry's
centrality in realizing mundane & profound instances in the everyday
extraordinary."

I'm agnostic on this point--a lot depends on what we take the terms to
mean.  In general, I am inclined to take the Systems Reply (and yes,
that's precisely the argument I was making) as a demonstration that
Searle's thought experiment is confused and therefore meaningless, NOT
as a demonstration that systems can think.

But one can certainly understand the human brain, and all of the many
extra-brain processes involved with cognition and emotion, as a
"system."  So we need more precise questions.

Will machines be able to think, i.e. to be conscious and to understand?
Since I am a monist and more or less a materialist, I believe so,
though of course we won't know for sure until it happens.  And we may
not know then, given the unshareable nature of consciousness.

Will machine thinking, when it happens, be digital? I don't know.  It
isn't digital in animals (including humans), that's clear enough.  So I
kind of doubt it.  Digital machine thinking would be truly alien.  But
it would be presumptuous to think that the way animals (including
humans) do things is the only way they can be done.

At the expense of not putting an artificial cyber-head (AI) on this, your
furturist estimation here, Joe, reminds me of a certain taxi rides (packed
to the gills) across parts of East and West Nigeria, where the driver (an
agent of the Iron God) would take careful aim - if I remember correctly - at
dogs and chickens, but put the brakes on at the sight of a duck or anyone
nod conducive to iron. The former were creatures of sacrifice worthy of the
Iron God (whose Yoruba name I forget this evening).  In any case the driver
had no doubt that he should aim his iron machine at the appropriate animal
(risking our poor lives). Tears for the duck, and cheers for the others. In
your terms, Joe, there was absolutely no blurring between machine, spirit
and material object.

Which is say, or ask, is the ultimate reality of AI re-introduced animism
and sympathetic magic. Indeed a refreshing boon to acts of the imagination?

&, for the gods know, whatever impact on our experience of marathon poetry
readings (MLA or not)  - each and every word conjoined to the stars (real
stars).

Just a thought on a real long, dark, cloudy, starless San Francisco night!

Tinfish Annual Report

In the past year, Tinfish Press has continued to publish excellent
experimental poetry from the Pacific region, with emphasis on writing
and cutting edge design work by artists from Hawai`i and elsewhere. In
2006 we’ve published:

Jozuf Hadley, aka bradajo, TWO POEMS BAI BRADAJO, poems in Hawaiian
Creole English (Pidgin), with accompanying cd. $14

Jacinta Galea`i, ACHING FOR MANGO FRIENDS, a chapbook in English and Samoan.

TINFISH 16, in collaboration with TROUT 13. Another collection of poetry
by various authors who are not usually to be found inside the same
covers. $8

In the near future, we will be publishing:

Leonard Schwartz, LANGUAGE AS RESPONSIBILITY, on the Palestine/Israel
conflict and a poetics of publishing across boundaries.

Sarith Peou, COUNTING CORPSES, poems about life in Cambodia under the
Khmer Rouge.

Pam Brown & Maged Zaher, poems in collaboration.

Kaia Sand on secret Oregon histories.

Hazel Smith’s full-length book EROTICS OF GEOGRAPHY, with accompanying
CD-ROM.

TINFISH 17

THE BEST OF TINFISH COLORING BOOK (with accompanying exhibition). 17
artists will create works based on 17 poems from Tinfish’s 11 year
history; the results will be published as an interactive coloring book.

And, if that’s not enough, we’re hoping to start a reading series that
will pair writers in Hawai`i with writers from elsewhere, to continue
our project of building bridges between local, national, and
international writing.

All of this takes resources. We give our time to the project, but need
money to make our ideas into books. To help us out, please donate some
tax deductible (we are non-profit in more ways than one!) monies to us
at Tinfish Press, 47-728 Hui Kelu Street #9, Kane`ohe, HI 96744, or
through the “purchase” function at http://tinfishpress.com

Better yet, buy some Tinfish Press books! Best wishes for a happy and
productive New Year. May there be some peace for us all.

Not sensible to say a system (
http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/system ) understands anything? I
disagree. Our own understanding of things is not done by a little man inside
our head living alone on the couch. Our own understanding and consciousness
is a vast network of inter-related 'parts of ourself' or 'subsystems'. We
are each of us a virtual cosmos of inter-related parts, no one of which is
the essential 'us'. Our minds are themselves systems of vast proportions. We
contain cosmos. Every little thing we do is magic, draws on depths we do not
understand but can nonetheless acknowledge. Even the simple act of
remembering something is mysterious and draws on numerous parts of ourselves
we barely comprehend.

This thread began with discussion of the cutup. The cutup is often thought
to fragment what was whole. Sometimes when working with cutups we feel that
the wholeness was a carefully manicured impression of the aggregate that had
more variety and individuals lurking in it than we had known.

double work of the dream: the dream is _worked_ - energy expended in its
production, energy expended in the production of the mise en scene; and
the dream _works_ - transforms anomaly into homeostatis. in _dreamwork,_
the dream sutures and stitches the wounded.

double work of code: the code is _worked_ - energy expended in its produc-
tion, energy expended in the production of its graphemic output; and the
code _works_ - transforms output into semantics. in _codework,_ code both
sutures and ruptures, stitches and wounds.

the _codework of the dreamwork_ - dream decoding and production (symbolic)
the _dreamwork of the codework_ - code decoding and a-production
(imaginary)

There is no _fundamental unit_ of either code or dream; code runs into the
discursive formation described by Christian Metz in his film semiotics -
it slips, just as dream slips in a more acceptable analysis.

Quick apology for my remark - which must have seemed
from out of nowhere, meaningless. Very interesting
discussion and I appreciate the fact that I am smart
enough, at the very least, to hold-tight and read what
is a wonderful discussion.

The point of the Chinese Room thought experiment is to question
whether things that we normally think of as requiring thought can be
done with no thought at all. The construction of the Chinese Room is
purposefully done to eliminate the possibility that the "whole
system" is thinking. The basis of the thought experiment is that the
whole is NOT thinking. The beginning conditions posit, instead, one
set of symbols is being substituted, without thought, for another but
in a context (the room itself) that leaves the room's observers
without knowledge of what's going on inside the room with the
impression either that there is a Chinese-speaking person inside the
room, or that the room itself speaks Chinese when in fact we, the
knowledgeable observers, KNOW, as part of the postulates of the room,
that there is not a Chinese-speaking person inside the room AND that
the room itself is not speaking Chinese.

You have to start there, in good faith with the thought experiment,
or else you are changing the thought experiment entirely -- else you
are committing the logical fallacy of begging the question, assuming
your conclusion in your premise, when you say the whole system is
thinking.

Wes Chapman suggests that the thought experiment is flawed and thus
irrelevant because Searle has failed to account for the rules by
which the non-Chinese speaker sorts through Chinese characters to
produce an appropriate Chinese response. Chapman says that we might
consider that the rules themselves are doing the thinking, and he
points out that there are no such rules extant -- that we're not even
close to being able to formulate such rules. I think this fails, too,
because the rules themselves are as fictional as the situation of the
room. Searle doesn't have to account for them any more than he has to
account for how to feed or evacuate the wastes of the person in the
room. The rules are postulated as part of the condition of the
thought experiment.

Searle's experiment asks "If a machine passes the Turing Test
consistently, what then?" The Chinese Room attempts to refute the
Turing Test as THE test of whether a system thinks by positing a
system that from the outside we'd have to agree DOES think, but by at
the same time revealing to us that no thinking whatever is going on.
Positing those two contradictory as-yet-fictional facts is the point
of the Chinese Room thought experiment. You have to start there in
good faith or else you're merely changing the beginning point and, by
changing it, are changing this thought experiment into some other
thought experiment.

Chapman's suggestion that it is the rules doing the thinking is
really just another way to phrase "The Systems Reply" -- it puts off
the question rather than answering it. Chapman is right that no such
rules exist, and that we're not even very close to formulating such
rules. But that's no reason not to do the thought experiment that
asks what happens if there were such rules. The question of the
Chinese Room remains: "Given these initial conditions, what then?"

Marcus





But there is an essential element missing from the brain analogy,
which reveals the trouble with this entire line of argument. We know
that the brain is the physical organ of thought; the only question is
whether it produces thought in some circumscribed portion-a
specialized "thinking department"-or acts en bloc. This makes it
legitimate to conclude, if an exhaustive search reveals no such
portion, that the whole brain is involved in thinking. But we cannot
conclude by analogy that the whole Chinese Room is thinking, because
the question of whether thought is involved at all in that "system"
is precisely what is in question. This is not to say that thinking
has never been involved in the history of the Chinese Room
(presumably the lexicon writer could think), only that active
thinking is already finished before the Chinese Room opens for
business. What remains is the pickled or flash-frozen product of
thinking, which is just sufficient to produce the effect the
originating thinker (or programmer) intended.

marcus,

the searle chinese room thought experiment (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Room ) is misguided in its conception
of programming. it simply posits a static rule book and a follower of the
rules of the rule book. but the rule book (ie the programming) need not be
static. the rule book is continually being re-written. computer programs
also can re-write their own programming, by the way, or the code of other
programs.

we ourselves know it is hard for us to change our own programming, our
habits, our ingrained behaviors, that which we do without conscious
consideration.  but we also know that while it is difficult, it is also
possible. this is part of what it means to be able to learn. when we learn a
language, we not only write ourselves a rule book that is used to process
the language but also write ourselves rule books on how to edit our rule
books. Additionally, the rule books query colorful relational databases that
we build up. These databases store experience that is coded into objects,
events, and their properties, such as words for them. But clearly there is
no one-to-one relation between words and the objects of our memory.

i'm suggesting, marcus, that searle's chinese room thought experiment does
not give us a very rich scenario for what is involved in programming that
might aspire to something as complex as mind.

one might reply to the above by saying, well, however complex the
programming, however many guards are guarding the guards, it is still simply
a turing machine crunching symbols. but we ourselves convert our sensory
impressions to some sort of informational representation, whether the
representation is digital or not, and store and process those .

...and according to COLLEGE ENGLISH v22 n6 March 1961 it was from p.
142 of Stevens' Necessary Angel. Except that quote, which obviously I
would take over Longenbach's, has it: "...the great poems of heaven
and hell have been written and the great poem of the earth remains to
be written."

Of course, I'm not sure which edition of The Necessary Angel, but it
must be prior to 1961.

It is on page 142 of the Vintage paperback of The Necessary Angel
with a most recent copyright of 1961. You can find this edition in
used bookstores pretty easily.

This passage occurs midway through "Imagination as Value" right after
a bullet list of things noted about Pascal in Joyce's Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man. JP

I've written some of those self-writing programs. They don't
invalidate the Chinese Room experiment. The self-writing program -
even if it self-modifies - is still an example of a von Neuman
machine. Each instruction is processed step by step. That's what a
computer does, even the fancier pipe-lining models. Even parallel
computers conform to this linear processing model. The Chinese Room is
a thought experiment and presents it's details starkly.

To use another metaphor, the Mechanical Turk, the computer is always
controlled by someone, just at a distance in the terms of the program.
The computer can never break out of the algorithmic control laid down
by the programmer. If it transitions from one behaviour to another,
then it's doing what it's told :-) A computer never self-actualises,
it never says to itself, "I feel like a cup of coffee now". If it did,
I wouldn't trust it to mow the lawn.

For a long time, Science Fiction writers used the mind as a metaphor
for the supposed machine-minds. This has led us a merry dance,
particularly with AI, which seemed to offer the promise of the machine
mind. Sci-fi writers got it wrong; they also got wrong the speed of
computers and, up until the eighties/nineties and the advent of the
internet, the distributed nature of computers and networks, of our
reality. I think distributed computers, and their real-time parallel
processing, their chatter in protocols, is a step nearer to sentience.
There are various ideas abroad about building machines using small
units, and simple rules. Think Game-of-life but in a mechanical form.
Not as glamorous as AI, obviously (^_^) but something which I think
may stand a better chance of working.

You walk water towns, faceless and arrogant.
Dripping crystal limbs of pure light.

Dripping crystal lint of puree light.
You walk water tower faces, endlessly ignorant.

Endlessly raining, seamlessly sick.
Drifting critical patch. Pretty life.
Endlessly faceful, determined to saturate.

Light purls. Gingerly forceful,
You walk water, down to faceless.

Ending arrogance.

Jim,

I would like to approach the question from another angle, not of
understanding (does the machine understand Chinese, etc?) or achievement;
but of class or race. Even if a "box"/robot is as intelligent or
knowledgeable, etc., does it belong to the same class? As human beings, are
we ready to accept a total democracy between the machine and the human? The
line of debate here seems to assume that one is dealing with a purely
empirical issue, to be determined by "facts" or arguments around symbolic
logic . Is it so? Is the question not as strongly ethical or metaphysical,
an issue of choice?

This is not an idle question, but full of profound anxiety. Think, for
example, of the novel "Do Humanoids(?) Dream of Electric Sheep?" Synthetic
pets may be as cute, if not cuter, and as loving as its "non-digital" (?)
counterparts. Besides, they are deathless -since eternally replicable-
consquently avoiding causing the unpleasant experience of loss. Why, then,
even the mangiest of dogs is a desperate object of desire in the novel?

Ciao,

Murat

David,

A few random thoughts around your explosive post:

a) Another text pointing to the emerging importance of the eye over the ear
(pattern, movement over sound) is Barthes's essay on Loyola. In his
introduction to Loyola's work, Barthes says that the final stage in Loyolan
meditation is to create a visual field of absolute equilibrium where nothing
directs the mind one way or another; the mind has no choice but to choose at
random -an ultimate act of liberation. All he remembers of Loyola, Barthes
says, is Loyola's "eyes full of tears" -an image very relevant also to
Turkish Sufism.

b) Villon's coded communications in his poetry is almost exactly the style
of the Turkish poet Ece Ayhan's "A Blind  Cat Black" and "Orthodoxies" (Sun
and Moon Press). With one difference: the surface clarity and transparency
of Villon's poetry exists in Ece Ayhan in the clarity of its emotional
(rather than syntactic) timber.

c) The Turkish poet Ilhan Berk (Talisman Books), who is in his eighties now,
was in New York three years ago. I took him the the Guggenheim's Museum. He
ran through the displays exactly the same, only focusing on a few of them
for less than a minute. It was an amazing experience.

d) This connection (dialectic) between walking (movement) and seeing
(flanerie turning into vision) is crucial. For example, The Peripheral Space
of Photography emerges out of a walk in which seeing becomes a meditative,
fluid process.

Subject:      Aristotle's three unites / example poems
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

In a few months I'll be giving some workshops at which I plan to discuss Aristotle's three "unities" (time, place, and action) in relation to the crafting of poetry. I'm looking for some good short poems (to 30 lines but preferably shorter) that demonstrate or violate any of these unities (such as a poem that seems to be taking place at two different times or two different places). If you have some examples to share (with comments on them also welcom), I'd be most grateful. In some cases, a violation of these unities happens in a FAILED poem, and may be why it doesn't get published, so examples of that would be welcome too, though obviously they'd be harder to find (unless you've got some skeletons in your closet?). Much appreciated if anyone can help!

My feeling is that sometimes it's fine to "violate" these unities in poetry, whereas sometimes it's not. For example, in a haiku, to convey an experience that is taking place in two different locations couldn't actually be experienced in the "here and now," so that could be a problem. Likewise, if a haiku is two moments, or too long a moment, that also weakens the focus and effectiveness of the poem. For example poems, I'd prefer something other than haiku or tanka, by the way.

P.S. One of the workshops I'll be giving is for the Whidbey Island Writers Conference (http://www.writeonwhidbey.org/Conference/), near Seattle, coming up March 2-4, 2007.

This is why I think it's important to pay attention to the metaphors built into our language, and to be careful with the applications of universals like "system." I think the only thing it's sensible to literally predicate the verb "to understand of" are minds and things that have minds. So, in our world, and with our language, that's people and animals. It's true to say a mind is a system, but to say a system is therefore a mind and capable of understanding is to beg the question. I think if it does anything, and I'm pretty unimpressed by and large with a lot of the things the Chinese Room thought experiment claims to show, the scenario at root shows that not all systems are minds. That's pretty uncontroversial. I don't think the HVAC in my apartment building is a mind that understands room temperature and airflow, although that's an awfully pretty metaphor. And that's really where I think
a lot of this goes wrong. To pick up a thread from what Murat wrote earlier, to my way of thinking, real number computation isn't what goes on in the human brain. That what goes on in the human brain might be described or modelled in those terms is another matter, and I can certainly conceive of a computer model that simulated the workings of a brain in quantum detail. The question, and I think it is an open one, is whether such a model would be a mind. I think not on grammatical grounds. Our understanding of minds is largely extrapolated from our own experience of thought, self-awareness, and consciousness. I don't think you have to argue for the existence of one of Ryle's ghosts in the machine (one of the most lovely and poetic phrases to come out of 20th c. analytic philosophy, in my opinion, and i think it's ironic that Ryle came up with the expression as a form of ridicule.) I also think
that whether or not there is a ghost in the machine is a sticky knot of a question that neuroscience to date has to leave to conjecture based on one's metaphysical commitments. What form the ghost might take, whether it's some metaphysical mental extra that supervenes on the brain, is some sort of emergent property of neural networks, or is merely an epiphenomenal accident of some sort, I don't feel comfortable speculating about. I do think, however, that the understanding of consciousness has progressed past the point of early computer science's speculation that the brain might be some sort of computational object along the lines of a turing machine, and I think the chinese room is a nice, but flawed, example of why that is.

Jim, it honestly pains me to have to insist that yours may not be a
wholly fair dismissal of Searle's Chinese Room argument.

Computing machines (von Neumann machines) adhere to rule sets, whether
or not there are higher-level "dynamic" languages (e.g., Ruby) built on
top of them.  Further, one could easily change Searle's own rule set,
his assumptions, to assume that the ruleset is dynamic.  His point would
still hold.  And perhaps more importantly, what is that point of
Searle's argument?  Searle's "point" is to show that consciousness is
something rather beyond the evaluation of a Turing test.  More simply,
you can pass for understanding something, for being aware of and
understanding of language itself, just by appearing to be able to
manipulate it.  Even simpler: syntax use doesn't imply mind.  It's not
complete enough of an explanation for us so why would we make it a
standard for us?

Searle shares other compelling reasons why consciousness is beyond many
verification means in his _Redicscovery of the Mind_ (MIT, 1993).  That
a computer can be dynamic in its fundamental ruleset could really only
help support Searle's thesis rather than undermine it.

Searle is an incredible thinker and I think it is unfair to a heck of a
lot of smart and hard-working people to brush aside in an ill-considered
way a lot of years of really smart work.  That many of them are
philosophers should make no difference.

But maybe what you're saying *could* be better rewritten this way: human
consciousness as evidenced by a turing test cannot be sufficiently
evidenced by a combination of syntax and semantics alone.  Here's how.
A syntax can only describe a previous rather than a present state of a
human language user.  That dynamism in language preventing a live
descriptive complete syntax is *fundamental* and chaotic (after all
Zipf's Law is really best understood as the Zipf-Mandelbrot Law).  At
any given time there is no complete syntax of the state of the present
system except in the future, after the behavior has already passed.

There's a tiny wormhole there between syntax and semantics via the use
of time, and it can be seen in the chaotic operations of functions
words, words often dismissed by computational linguists, text miners,
etc.  These words are often on "stop lists" and chucked away.  (Use
Google and watch it dump those words, as if they have no linguistic
value.)

Function words have tremendous value. These words effectively have
little *semantic* value in and of themselves, sure.  However they
manipulate or alter the semantics of proximal words given a set of
particular circumstances (context, which necessitates a user).  "The
car" means something very different from "a car" even in an impoverished
context such as this sentence, this argument, etc.  But what it means
does vary from the addition of "a" to "car" and "the" to "car".  But HOW
"a" and "the" change the semantics of "car" is impossible to capture
except in hindsight.  Syntax is always therefore past tense.  Syntax is
always a story of the way language was, or, worse, a manifestation of
someone's personal control problems (see Safire, William).

The syntactic rules for these function words are so fluid that truly at
any given time they are internally inconsistent. It is this very
argument that I've demonstrated in a slight way statistically in my
research during the last few years.  My redicovery of it (rather my
recasting of something already well-known) was accidental.
Unfortunately the official publication of the data supporting such work
is in glacial academic limbo, subject to a precedent-setting property
rights review committee in the state university system.  Long story.

marcus,

the searle chinese room thought experiment (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Room ) is misguided in its conception
of programming. it simply posits a static rule book and a follower of the
rules of the rule book. but the rule book (ie the programming) need not be
static. the rule book is continually being re-written. computer programs
also can re-write their own programming, by the way, or the code of other
programs.

Computers working in parallel simply increase the speed of processing versus
one processor. In other words, n processors working in parallel can actually
process n things at the same time, but any task that can be done by n
processors can also be done by 1 (just slower, if the task can really be
distributed).

We make choices all the time. Computers can do that too. The 'if-then-else'
statement in programming is a way of building choice into programs. But we
can't make choices different from the ones we make. And neither can
computers. In other words, if we freeze a moment in time and *absolutely
nothing changes*, then when time resumes, we will still do what we were
going to do. State determines action. Neither we nor computers are at
liberty to change that. But that doesn't mean we don't have free will and
make choices. We do indeed make choices. And so can computers be programmed
to make choices. Free will does not consist in our not being programmed, but
in our ability to make choices. Just because something is programmed doesn't
mean it is incapable of making choices.

In some sense, yes, the program can never break out of the algorithmic
control laid down by the programmer, but this is no more true of computers
than it is of humans. Programs can re-write their own programming, but you
could say that they do so in accordance with their programming. But at
iteration 500, the actions of the program might be completely unrecognizable
by and unpredictable to the programmer. But were there world enough and
time, the change of states could be followed. The same is true, though, of
human progress from yesterday to today.

The programmers of Deep Blue would almost certainly lose to it in a game of
chess. Unless they play through an exact sequence of moves they know it is
weak on--and the programming does not branch randomly among equally good
alternatives, which it probably does. In which case they are less engaged in
a normal game of chess than symbol crunching.

Hi Murat,

I agree that it's not an idle question; Joe Amato raised related issues in
his post in this thread.

It may be that, historically, only those groups who have insisted on it
have, in the end, achieved equality with the dominant group.

When we have access to the source code and so may explicitly trace the
mechanisms of the behavior, the machine appears to be simply a mechanical
contrivance. When we do not have access to the source code, as is the case
with living beings and proprietary software, we are forced to look carefully
at the actions of the person or thing. As you and Joe eloquently point out,
the issue of whether intelligence or even sentience can be present then
takes on ethical dimensions.

Turing's conclusion was that if we can't tell the difference between a
machine's behavior and human behavior, then we have no defensible basis upon
which to deny the existence of intelligence in the machine. Is the same true
of sentience?

Ah the pleasures of simplistic partisanship!

Roger Day writes that "given that talking to Iran and
Syria is inimical to the State of Israel's foreign
policy, I do not think it coincidental that Bush has
rejected that option".  Evidently, in regard to Syria,
(it's true that the Israeli government advocates a
harsh policy towards the Iran of Ahmadinejad) it's
been a concern regarding bucking Bush's own
disposition that has been blocking cowardly
politicians such as Olmert from activating the
possiblity of Israeli peace talks with Syria.

Below is a possibly illuninating article about this
matter from the Americans for Peace Now site
(www.peacenow.org), and there is also an editorial
about this in the latest issue of the Forward
(www.forward.com), where incidentally one can also
read "Rattling the Chains of American Poetry", an
essay concerning some fellow named Bernstein.

Anyway, one may want to explore the
Arab/Palestinian/Israeli struggle from within a
different paradigm than the Noble Armed National
Liberation Struggle De Jour.





APN Media Backgrounder: "Why Isn’t Olmert Accepting
Assad’s Invitation to Negotiate"

12/21/06

The past several days have demonstrated, again, the
absurdity of America's blocking Israel from talking to
Syria.

Syria's President Bashar Assad has been repeatedly
calling in recent months for direct, unconditional
peace negotiations with Israel. In a December 16
interview with the Italian daily La Repubblica, Assad
said: "When there is peace, people can live in peace
and harmony side by side… but peace should be
established first. There are no obstacles in Syria
over this as we are enjoying the support of the whole
Syrian people to establish peace because we are going
to restore our land. But is Israel ready to accept
peace?"

Assad addressed Olmert directly. "Make an attempt.
Call our bluff. The Syrian people are united on this:
reach peace to get back our lands," he challenged.

Syria's foreign minister, Walid Moallem, told The
Washington Post's David Ignatius (December 15) that
Syria has no preconditions to negotiations with
Israel, not even regarding the Golan Heights. In an
interview in Damascus, Moallem told Ignatius, "A
constructive dialogue has to start without
preconditions."

An Americans for Peace Now (APN) delegation heard
similar things from the Syrian ambassador to
Washington, Imad Moustapha. At a November 30th
meeting, Moustapha said that Syria and all other Arab
countries would be willing to establish full, normal
peaceful relations with Israel in return for a full
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and from
"Lebanese territories," (meaning the Shebaa Farms) and
allowing the Palestinians to have their own
independent sovereign and viable state. An
Israeli-Syrian peace agreement, the ambassador said,
would serve as a "paradigm shift" in the region and is
bound to positively impact on Israel's relations with
its other Arab neighbors.

Members of the Israeli cabinet are divided on whether
Israel should act upon Assad's peace overtures.
Several ministers representing the Labor Party and
Shas spoke in favor of examining Assad's calls for
negotiations.

Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and his Kadima colleagues,
however, rejected negotiations with Assad, as they did
throughout the past three months.

So far, Israeli officials refrained from explicitly
saying that their opposition to engaging with Syria
stemmed from America's policy of isolating Assad's
regime.

This week, however, they finally said it. Facing
growing bewilderment among Israelis over Olmert's
rejection of an Arab leader's repeated calls for peace
talks, cabinet members admitted that Israel is
rejecting Syria's peace overtures because it does not
want to break ranks with the Bush administration.

Justice Minister Ronni Baron told Israeli television
Channel 10 on December 17: "When the question on the
agenda is the political legacy of Israel's greatest
friend, President Bush, do we really need now to enter
into negotiations with Syria?"

Other government ministers were even more explicit at
the weekly cabinet meeting earlier that day.

Israeli cabinet meetings are held behind closed doors
and are off the record. But verbatim quotes from the
meeting are traditionally leaked to the media.
According to several reports in Israel's news media
that day, Vice-Premier Shimon Peres reportedly said:
"the worse thing we could do is contradict the United
States, which opposes negotiating with Syria, and
negotiate just because Assad wants to get himself out
of trouble."

And Prime Minister Olmert reportedly said: "Bush has a
clear position on this issue. One should ask whether,
when the president of the United States, Israel's most
important ally, is struggling on every front  -
including the internal front – against those who are
trying to thwart his policy, it is appropriate for
Israel to say the opposite."

These comments raised a wave of protest. Knesset
Member Ran Cohen of Meretz observed: "We have reached
an absurd situation in which Syria is bending over
backwards to signal Israel of its seriousness, while
the Israeli leadership is bending over backwards to
prevent any progress."

Knesset Member Yoram Marciano of Labor said: "Israel
must respond to the Syrian foreign minister's call to
hold negotiations without preconditions. We must not
miss the window of opportunity to create a genuine
dialogue between us and our neighbor."

The notion that Israel may be missing an opportunity
for peace because of America's Mideast policy
triggered many critical articles in the Israeli press.
A particularly powerful one is Amos Oz's Yedioth
Ahronoth December 17 op-ed. Oz, one of fIsrael's
leading novelists, is a founder of Peace Now.

I know many're gonna think, and perhaps rightly so,
that what I'm offering up is beneath the list.

I would say, however, this episode, which, for
whatever reason has been discussed on CNN, is just
another aspect of what we are faced with examining in
our discussions of popular culture.

Does anyone think that Donald Trump has been able to
make the kinds of disparaging remarks he has about
Rosie O'Donnell in large part because she is a lesbian
woman?

Or, rather, that in the eyes of many folk - from what
I'm catching online, and this is entertaining from my
side of the world, I'm embarrassed to say, she is just
a bitchy Dyke (two words I am not one to use).

I say this because Donald Trump has made a few remarks
related to her sexuality, and on a few programs (along
with her weight) - and, at least to me, I'm wondering
if there's a kind of sexism and old school bigotry
being played out for public consumption and to greater
culture's detriment.

Who cares? Trump's spot on: Rosie is a fat and ugly hag with a big mouth and
a penchant for dishonesty. I hope he sues like hell and knocks some sense --
and silence! -- into her. We'll all be the better for it.

Thanks, Don.

Hi Jim,

When you say "when we do not have access to the source code, as is the case
with living beings and proprietary software," are you not implicitly
assuming an equality, a democracy between living being and proprietory
software -in some way begging the issue?

In a related post in response to Patrick's argument that syntax can be
codified only through the element of time -in the past, the set of all
sentences, usages which have already occured-, I asked him if an infinite
set -including the future- can be codified. What kind of a code can an
infinite set have?

Here we enter a field with which you are much more familiar than me; maybe
my question has a simple answer (you remember my querying you about Cantor,
etal.?). Still, I do not think your assertion that the difference between
what seems codifiable and what does not is a matter of knowledge is itself
an empirical statement. Nor is the assertion a hypothesis, since it is not
clear at which point it will be decided to be true or false. It may be
axiomatic, taken as self-evident within symbolic logic, which itself is a
system. The other possibility is that it is a metaphysical assertion -a much
pooh poohed word in our parlance, but absolutely  vital-. Metaphysics is a
synthesis of  values and analysis -which brings us back to my original
suggestion: can  the question of parity -democracy, equality, etc.- between
machine and human be answered without  introducing the  issue of values, the
social system within which the question is being asked?

When Turing says "if we can't tell the difference between a
machine's behavior and human behavior, then we have no defensible basis upon
which to deny the existence of intelligence in the machine," what is that
court before which the human is indefensible? Do we all become K's before
this court -a court of supreme intelligence and efficiency? When did a court
ever "judge" the intelligence of a person, except its lack being a
mitigating factor? Doesn't the judgement concern something else?

Ciao,

Murat

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

In this week's Guardian Unlimited is a response "John Berger is Wrong"
penned by Julius Anthony and Simon Schama.
The address is:
http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/

look in box on right hand side of screen and you'll see it listed as number
five
under "most active" along with the responses following--(weird reading them
as a good many are same people over and over talking amongst themselves)


Thank you Stephen Baraban for the links you sent--I read the articles you
recommended and also the "rattling the Chains of American Poetry"  review of
Bernstein's book Girly Man in the journal the Forward.
     "Rattling the chains" is a funny image--like Scrooge following the
ghost of Christmas Past with his rattling chains--and then rattling
chains--well it depends which side of the chains you are on and how they are
heard (if heard)  to be rattling by whom.   And then why not break the
chains?  It also brings to mind the song "Chain of Fools" written by
singer/songwriter Don Covay for Aretha Franklin and the unofficial anthem of
Black soliders in Vietnam.  My daughter is named Covay Maria Nadine for him
and that song one of favorites by him. "Chain chain chain . . . chain of
fools . . . "

        In the review, David Kaufmann writes of Bernstein's schtick of
exposing cliches in a rapid fire patter.  On the one hand this is as
Kaufmann notes a deflationary exercise--on the other it can be seen as an
inflationary one, "I'm smarter than you are" in the use of language. So--a
questioning of this as what it means to be a poet?  Via the history of the
technique from television and vaudeville (and much further back in time and
space, across continents)--it's a tried and true one and immensely popular.
(My favorites are Chico Marx and Rodney Dangerfield.)  At a certain point,
with all due respect, I wonder (i have read the book) if the chains being
rattled aren't Mr. Bernstein's own, and far too much "earth shaking" gets
read into it. Another way of looking at it might be "wanting to have one's
cake and eat it, too".  That is, to be both personal as David Kaufmann
points out, and political at the same time and on top of this, to become
popular, more mainstream, by injecting more of the dread "personal".  It's
in that sense I mean the rattling of the chains is Mr. Bernstein's own.  He
may well be on the way to writing poetry best sellers up there with Billy
Collins and company. ("Content's dream"  . . . )

        I didn't grow up with television (the review points out this
influence on Mr. Bernstein) but read a lot of hard boiled novels and they
play pretty fast and wild with cliches too.  (Not to mention creating rafts
of them!)
       The use of cliche as a masking and sublimating device is brilliantly
used by Jim Thompson through the voice of Sheriff Lou Ford in The Killer
Inside Me (1952).
       Sheriff Ford calls this technique "applying the needle"--making the
victim squirm and sweat, tortured by the engulfing onslaught of superficial
banalities.  Beneath the superficial is that vast emptiness--in which exists
"the killer inside me".  Only a supreme effort of will can keep the cliches
coming and the emptiness at bay . . .

"Well, I tell you," I drawled.  "I tell you the way I look at it, a man
doesn't get any more out of life than what he puts into it."
    "Ummm." he said, fidgeting.  "I guess you're right, Lou."
     "I was thinking the other day, Max; and all of a sudden I had the
doggonedst thought.  It came to me out of a clear sky--the boy is father to
the man.  Just like that.  The boy is father to the man."
      The smile on his face was getting strained.  I could hear his shoes
creak as he squirmed.  If there's anything worse than a bore, it's a corny
bore.  But how can you brush off a nice friendly fellow who'd give you his
shirt if you asked for it?"
    "I reckon I should have been a college professor or something like
that," I said.  "Even when I'm asleep I'm working out problems.  Take the
heat wave we had a few weeks ago;  a lot of people think it's the heat makes
it so hot.  But it's not like that, Max.  It's not the heat, it's the
humidity.  I'll bet you didn't know that, did you?"
    He cleared his throat and muttered something about being wanted in the
kitchen.  I pretended like I didn't hear him.
     "Another thing about the weather," I said.  "Everyone talks about it,
but no one does anything.  But maybe it's better that way.  Every cloud has
its silver lining, at least that's the way I figure it.  I mean, if we
didn't have rain we wouldn't have rainbows, now would we?"
     "Lou . . . "
      "Well," I said, "I guess I better shove off.  I've got quite a bit of
getting around to do, and I don't want to rush.  Haste makes waste, in my
opinion, look before you leap."
       That was dragging 'em in by the feet, but I couldn
't hold 'em back.  Striking at people that way is almost as good as the
other, the real way.  . .

I've done quite a bit of writing using mangled translations and, in
particular, the English used to decorate things in Japan, and what
I've always wondered is, at what point does bad translation become
great poetry? Who gets credit: the writer or the observer? In other
words, is "snake eating three ways" poetry, or found poetry?

One thing to remember, and there're some articles
related to this topic online, is that bad translation,
as you say, is forming the basis of contemporary
English - or International/Global English, English as
lingua franca. And, of course, this has always been
the case - and certainly explains some of the unique
characteristics of, for example, English in the U.S.

I know a little about this from working for the
British Council-China and for curriculum development
done and teaching at, for example, Tsinghua University
- in addition to positions in the private sector (both
in Haerbin and Beijing, two cities culturally quite
different). I know that David Graddol has written and
lectured about this subject, and I seem to remember an
article in an International edition of Newsweek from
Last year - and, as you know, the editions can be
quite different (marketing, of course, a
consideration).

If you look at this poem, as an example, "It's a
quarter to half past two" is, literally, 2:15 - and
was something taken directly from conversation.
Necessarily, as observers of culture, it's necessary
to utalize all tools at our disposal.

Hotel Log Hints at Illicit Desire That Dr. Freud
Didn’t Repress


By RALPH BLUMENTHAL
Published: December 24, 2006

Maybe it was just a Freudian slip. Or a case of hiding
in plain sight.


Freud signed the register, above, at the hotel where
he stayed with his sister-in-law in 1898, as Dr.
Sigmund Freud and wife.
Either way, Sigmund Freud, scribbling in the pages of
a Swiss hotel register, appears to have left the
answer to a question that has titillated scholars for
much of the last century: Did he have an affair with
his wife’s younger sister, Minna Bernays?

Rumors of a romantic liaison between Freud and his
sister-in-law, who lived with the Freuds, have long
persisted, despite staunch denials by Freud loyalists.
The Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung, Freud’s
disciple and later his archrival, claimed that Miss
Bernays had confessed to an affair to him. (The claim
was dismissed by Freudians as malice on Jung’s part.)
And some researchers have even theorized that she may
have become pregnant by Freud and have had an
abortion.

What was lacking was any proof. But a German
sociologist now says he has found evidence that on
Aug. 13, 1898, during a two-week vacation in the Swiss
Alps, Freud, then 42, and Miss Bernays, then 33, put
up at the Schweizerhaus, an inn in Maloja, and
registered as a married couple, a finding that may
cause historians to re-evaluate their understanding of
Freud’s own psychology.

A yellowing page of the leather-bound ledger shows
that they occupied Room 11. Freud signed the book, in
his distinctive Germanic scrawl, “Dr Sigm Freud u
frau,” abbreviated German for “Dr. Sigmund Freud and
wife.”

“By any reasonable standard of proof, Sigmund Freud
and his wife’s sister, Minna Bernays, had a liaison,”
wrote Franz Maciejewski, a sociologist formerly at the
University of Heidelberg and a specialist in
psychoanalysis, who tracked down the record in August.


Freud’s wife, Martha, knew about his trip with Miss
Bernays, if not its nature. The same day Freud signed
the hotel ledger, he sent his wife a postcard
rhapsodizing about the glaciers, mountains and lakes
the pair had seen. In the card, published in Freud’s
collected correspondence, he described their lodgings
as “humble,” although the hotel appears to have been
the second-fanciest in town.

The evidence is persuasive enough for Peter Gay, the
Freud biographer and longtime skeptic on what he
called “the Minna matter,” to say that he is now
inclined to revise his work accordingly.

“It makes it very possible that they slept together,”
he said. “It doesn’t make him or psychoanalysis more
or less correct.”

The revelation is also likely to reignite a
longstanding debate about Freud’s personal life. The
father of psychoanalysis, whose 150th birthday was
celebrated this year, plumbed the darkest sexual
drives and secrets of the psyche. But scholars still
argue about how scrupulous Freud was in his own
behavior.

Peter L. Rudnytsky, a former Fulbright/Freud Society
Scholar of Psychoanalysis in Vienna and the editor of
the psychoanalytic journal American Imago, said the
disclosure was hardly a “so what?” matter because
“psychoanalysis has such a close relationship to the
life of Freud.”

“Psychoanalysis has invested a great deal in a certain
idealized image of Freud,” said Dr. Rudnytsky, a
professor of English at the University of Florida.
“Freud dealt with issues considered suspect —
sexuality — things that made people uncomfortable, so
Freud himself had to be a figure of impeccable
integrity.”

In any case, he said: “Things that happen in people’s
intimate lives are important. It’s very Freudian.”

Freud himself was cryptic, writing to the American
neurologist James J. Putman in 1915: “I stand for a
much freer sexual life. However I have made little use
of such freedom.”

Peter Swales, a historian and researcher who has spent
decades uncovering details of Freud’s relationship
with his sister-in-law, hailed the discovery as
recognition of what he called “Minna Bernays’s
central, fundamental and profound place in Freud’s
intellectual biography.”

How Dr. Maciejewski discovered the hotel ledger in
itself seems strangely Freudian. He spent August 2005
retracing the Swiss idyll taken by Freud and Miss
Bernays for a book, published this year, on Freud’s
long fixation on Moses.

While in Switzerland with Miss Bernays, Freud had
trouble remembering a name. Dr. Maciejewski theorized
that the lapse involved some secret guilt of Freud’s,
but he could not get to the bottom of it. However,
while reading the proofs of his book last spring, he
said, “a feeling of you forgot something crept over
me.”

In August, he returned to Maloja, and asked at the
Schweizerhaus if the original guest book still
existed. It did, and there, on a page from 1898, he
found Freud’s entry.

Dr. Maciejewski said he came away convinced that “they
not only shared a bed, they were even up to
misrepresenting their relationship to strangers as
that of husband and wife, a subterfuge they surely
then maintained whenever feasible during subsequent
holidays together in faraway places.”

Dr. Maciejewski published an article about his find in
a German newspaper, the Frankfurter Rundschau, in
September. An English version will appear in American
Imago next month. Freud helped found the quarterly,
now published by Johns Hopkins University Press, in
1939, shortly before his death in London, where he
lived after fleeing the Nazis. Minna Bernays died in
London in 1941.

Jürg Wintsch, proprietor of the Schweizerhaus,
confirmed the existence of the ledger entry, which he
said Dr. Maciejewski had first brought to his
attention. He described Room 11, now called 24, as one
of the largest in the hotel and said its structure was
substantially unchanged since Freud’s visit. He said
he had been hoping to keep Freud’s stay there a secret
until the hotel’s 125th anniversary next June.

The triangle of Freud, his wife and her sister has
long been irresistible to scholars, including Dr. Gay,
who noted in a 1989 essay, “As every biographer of
Freud must ruefully acknowledge, that great unriddler
of mysteries left behind some tantalizing private
mysteries of his own.”

The most riveting among them, he wrote, were the
rumors of a love affair with Miss Bernays. But, he
added, scant evidence of any romance could be found in
the published correspondence between Freud and his
sister-in-law, although some letters were intriguingly
missing.

From the moment Freud fell in love with Martha Bernays
in 1882, he was also drawn to her “intelligent,
caustic” younger sister, Minna, whose fiancé died of
tuberculosis in 1886, the year the Freuds married, Dr.
Gay wrote in the essay. In 1896, Miss Bernays moved in
with the Freuds, helping with household chores and
child rearing. She lived with them, it turned out, for
42 years.

In 1953, Ernest Jones, Freud’s student and first
biographer, tried vigorously to dispel stray gossip
about Freud’s “second wife.” He dismissed what he
called “strange legends” and described Freud as
“monogamic in a very unusual degree.”

Mr. Jones wrote, “His wife was assuredly the only
woman in Freud’s love life, and she always came first
before all other mortals.”

This idyllic portrait largely held sway until 1969,
when John M. Billinsky, a psychologist at the Andover
Newton Theological School in Massachusetts, published
an interview he conducted with Jung in Switzerland in
1957. Recounting a visit with his wife to Freud in
Vienna in 1907, Jung told Dr. Billinsky that Freud had
said, “I am sorry I can give you no real hospitality;
I have nothing at home but an elderly wife.”

In contrast, Jung described Miss Bernays as “very good
looking” — although later photographs show her rather
dour and stolid — and said that in private she
confessed that “she was very much bothered by her
relationship with Freud and felt guilty about it.”

“From her I learned that Freud was in love with her
and that their relationship was indeed very intimate,”
Jung continued.

When Jung and Freud traveled to America in 1909, Jung
said, Freud confided some dreams about Mrs. Freud and
Miss Bernays, but then abruptly ended the discussion,
saying, “I could tell you more, but I cannot risk my
authority.”

Jung’s account was attacked as unreliable by, among
others, Dr. Kurt R. Eissler, the longtime director of
the Sigmund Freud Archives who, as recently as 1993,
six years before his death at 90, wrote in a published
essay, “In one respect Freud was undeniably superior
to Jung: his sexual record was lily white.”

Dr. Eissler said that Freud’s theory “of course was
obscene, with its eternal harping on sex, but the
conduct of the man who originated it was beyond
reproach.”

What Dr. Eissler did not say was that four years
before the Billinsky interview, he had heard many of
the same things about Freud and Miss Bernays firsthand
in an interview with Jung in Zurich in 1953. But Dr.
Eissler and the Freud Archives placed an embargo on
the transcript of the interview for 50 years and then
ordered the papers sealed for an additional 10 years,
until 2013. A German transcript, stamped
“Confidential,” in the Library of Congress was made
available in 2003 for reading only at the library,
although a copy was obtained by The New York Times.

In 1981, Dr. Eissler was at the center of an uproar at
the Archives when his designated successor as
director, Jeffrey M. Masson, was fired after breaking
ranks with orthodox Freudians over interpretations of
psychoanalytic theory and Freud’s character.

In the 1953 Jung interview, which Dr. Eissler
apparently never cited publicly, Jung said he thought
Miss Bernays had developed a psychological attachment
to Freud but that when he had broached the subject,
Freud turned unresponsive.

“Every man has his secrets,” Jung concluded, adding
that when it came to Freud himself, “the unconscious
was something which one should not touch.”

Jung theorized to Dr. Eissler that Freud had
experienced some disappointment in love, sublimating
it into a drive for power and developing a neurosis
expressed in fear of losing control of his bladder.

“It could be precisely that he got into this conflict
which in marriage is all too frequent, right?” Jung
said. “The young woman, the other woman.”

Jung said that he vaguely recalled something about “a
possible pregnancy,” but quickly added, “That can all
be a stupid assumption.”

Hardly so to Mr. Swales. In a 1982 journal article, he
argued that Freud’s story of a young man’s episode of
forgetfulness in his 1901 book, “The Psychopathology
of Everyday Life,” was actually thinly disguised
autobiography, exposing Freud’s own alarm over an
inconvenient pregnancy.

Since then, Mr. Swales said, he has traced a 1900 trip
by Freud and Miss Bernays to the Austrian town of
Meran where she may have had an abortion, falling
mysteriously ill after returning to Vienna.

Freud, in a letter to his friend Wilhelm Fliess, said
that Miss Bernays was suffering from a lung ailment,
but, Mr. Swales said, “The jury is still out.”

I think this is the article - an online version.

Another thing, which I do not think a lot of people
know, and I'm perhaps moving away from anecdotes
related to menus and local signs, but that what might
be termed as bad English might rather be described as
the best offering of what is being taught from
university text books. One example is Tsinghua
University (comparable to, say Harvard, but not
really, as is often the case at Chinese Universities,
where ambition is often not nearly as useful as logic
as able is to enable) I literally forced my way into
an editing position, with lots of support from my
chief, as they say, out of sheer frustration for what
I saw as substandard text books being written by the
university press. So, what I am saying is that in
China, for example, these errors are not always about
poor translation, but rather the adept usage of a
structurally poor educational system.

Oh, and lots of individuals learning English, and this
is my opinion, on the Mainland, just aren't
interested, in a substanitive way, in learning about
the cultural system bolstering and shaping, for whence
the language sprang and developed- as one, again, my
opinion, would be in a liberal education. And I think
I'm right about this - and I'm not saying this is
wrong, because language is a tool, but it is a
different way of approaching language learning and
cultural studies - of appropriating communication. So,
the language comes out as it does!

Nobody's saying a system is a mind, Jason, but that a mind is a system.

As for ghosts in the machine, try this. Whether we look at the processes of
the brain at a micro level or the processes of a large computer program,
again at a micro level, things like understanding and consciousness are no
where to be found. The micro-processes of the brain appear as mechanical as
the processes of a computer program. How could they not? They're brain
chemistry. No ghost. No little man inside the head that we can see with a
microscope. No discernable essence.

Things like understanding, consciousness, and sentience occur at a higher
level, at a system level, in the relations and interactions of the system.
Consciousness is not one thing but a million little things supporting one
another or at war with each other--in relation with each other. Because we
cannot pinpoint consciousness in the brain but, instead, only infer its
presence or absence by the behavior of the entity in question, we see that
consciousness itself is something like a ghost or a spirit. Now, I'm *not*
saying that it *is* a ghost or a spirit. But that it is *like* a ghost or a
spirit in that we cannot pinpoint it in the brain.

Whether this sort of high-level system intelligence is dependent on brain
chemistry or computer code may then be seen to be a secondary consideration.
Consciousness cannot be pin-pointed in the brain and it cannot be pinpointed
in computer code. Both the brain's chemistry and the computer processing are
mechanical systems that give no indication of consciousness directly but
only in the overall system behavior.

I'm not sure if you appreciate the generality of the Turing machine, Jason.
It's a very simple but very subtle machine. It is called the universal
computer for an important reason: because all machines that humanity has
currently dreamt up or truly realized are no more powerful in their
computational power than the Turing machine. It is 'the universal machine'
in the sense that any machine that we can make can be modelled as a Turing
machine, whether it is a computing device or any other type of device.

There is absolutely no accepted proof that there exist thought processes of
which humans are capable and computers are not. So there is absolutely
nothing that, in theory, precludes the possibility of creating machines that
think. They mayn't be human in their cogitations, because they would have
different bodies and experience and so on, most likely.

Consciousness is a matter of high-level system behavior. It has to do with
things like learning capacity, capacity with language, the ability to form
and use a world view, and to augment that world view with new experience and
insights. These sorts of considerations are independent of whether they
happen via digital processing or brain chemistry. The architecture of the
mind is a city in the air of information flow. Its structures are not made
of brain cells or computer code but flexible data structures that change
according to the flow of information through them. And, as such, the minds
may be realized through our biological heritage or computing devices--and
also, perhaps, via new types of machines, should we ever progress beyond the
capacities of the Turing machine--which, frankly, seems unlikely.

I'm going to reply to two emails in this message because there are more than
two messages I'd like to reply to in my allotted two messages today.

Perhaps you will find in my reply to Patrick, below, an attempt to address
his points directly.

Concerning the ethical status of software beings, Murat, we don't have to
deal with it yet, except hypothetically, because there are none yet that are
sufficiently sophisticated to challenge us so deeply. But there probably
will be, eventually. Don't know when. Assuming we aren't all swimming with
the fishes. We shall have to consider the rights and freedoms of sentient
beings regardless of their race, species, or biological/cybernetic origin. I
mean this issue will arise in courts of law, Murat, as beings or their
representatives seek recognition for their status as sentient beings.

Have you ever had the feeling, the realization, that you are a sentient
being independent of your race, species, or biological/cybernetic origin,
and what it might be like to concede/honour that dignity in another species
or even a cyborg? It's a consciousness that many science fiction writers
have explored. I think of the death scene of Roy, in Bladerunner/Do Androids
Dream of Electric Sheep. Actually, I also think of it concerning my cat, but
that's another matter.

Searle points out that if we know the internal workings of the entity, then
ascribing understanding or consciousness to it is indeed problematical. But
the same could be said of human cogitation, Patrick. Were we able to trace
human cogitation in the brain, it would appear mechanical. How could it not?
It is brain chemistry.

It's important to realize that understanding, consciousness, sentience, and
other such profoundly sentient notions are properties not of the
micro-mechanics of the processing, but are more high-level. It doesn't
matter whether the processing is carried out by one type of mechanical
process or another, e.g., whether the processing is digital or via brain
chemistry. Understanding and sentience are not predicated on a particular
type of microprocessing, e.g., animal or human brain chemistry.
Understanding and sentience are invisible at the level of brain chemistry or
computer CPU activity.

To point out that the processing is mindlessly mechanical in a computer and
then conclude that this precludes understanding and consciousness, etc, is
to deny its existence in humans as well, because our cognitive processes are
equally mechanical at the micro level. How could they not be?

The gods.


You have heard the tales of white birds, wings from dawn to dusk.
They fill the sky with translucence, muffle the shape of clouds.
Their cries gave someone the idea of language and mourning.
The utterance of the first word, 'inconceivable.'

The bittern knows the gods.

Tonight the gods will descend upon the earth.
They will sink into the earth, but only so much into the earth.
Sinking as if the soil were damp or marsh, unable to cope.
Unable to cope with so much deity, nonetheless resistant.
All gods are jagged gods and all gods are desperate.
All gods are the shifters in language of the second person.
Gods create the third person from the second person.
And beyond the third, a fourth, and beyond a fourth, the fifth.
Once the gods are created they are released.
That is one of the definitions of the gods.
The gods descend like rain into meadows and wild fields.
Fields lain fallow or fields of unspoken appearance beneath glacier and
stream.
Planted, their root systems are shallow, winds will trample them.
Storms will weigh them down with the pleasure and fecundity of water.
It is the incoherency of the gods that is their definitions.
What is released is incoherent, what is coherent is framed, what lies
between them is aliased.
The aliasing of the gods is the jagged of the gods and the names of the
gods, who abjure names.
The punishment of naming names, the punishment of names.
Like sea oats like ocotillo like willows like quaking aspen,
slight movements of the gods shimmer the murmurs of the worlds.
Gods are worlds, are incoherent worlds, every definition a definition
of the gods.
They come in winter. They reside.
Tonight the gods descend upon the earth.
They descend into the soft earth, they sink into the soft earth.
They are invisible to us, we are invisible to them.
The slightest impressions as they bend, move silently, the slightest
sounds, their murmuring.
All gods are smoothed, all gods are filled with the quietude of rustlings,
unfathomable beauty, mist at dawn, the vertical.

Very nice, Alan thanks.
I don't know if you know the rice marshes near Marysville, east of
Sacramento, California. This time of year the sky is robust with migrations
of birds (ducks, geese, etc., etc.)  - including the massive variations in
sounds. Your poem (work) would be right at home there

Jim,

Of course, as you also suggest, on a practical level the issue may not exist
yet; but on the level of anxiety, literature, it already is very cogent. I
agree with you "Blade Runners/Do Androids..." is perhaps the central work.
In the film Roy, in his/its last scene on the balcony, ledge is more human
than the humans -a self-awareness of mortality (not necessarily any
technological or mental feat) being the most human sentience there
is.Alsothe Ford character does escape (elope?) with the Sean
character, though it
is implied Ford himself/itself is an android.

Despite all this, in the film an idea of "irreducible" distinction is also a
constant, revolving around the "eye" tests.

In some ways, if one follows your point of view, assuming the difference
between computer/machine and human to be a continuum, then, the issue
becomes basically the same as the controversy around traditional and gay
marriages. The "future" history of Humanoid liberation becomes part of the
history of gay liberation.

I would like to bring another film which has a lot say about the issue,
Spielberg/Kubrick's A.I.  In that film all the technical problems are
solved. One is even able to create children who "feel" love, even possessed
of a odd version of The Oedipus Complex. But what happens if the "real"
child returns (recovers from sickness) and the android is dropped
(Oedipus-like in the fields)? An unredeemable sense of loss, of yearning (by
the "android" for its "human" mother) continues through centuries, the
3-hour long film. In other words, the idea of the wall, of distinction,
separation never disappears -even in this most pyrothecnic of American
directors, whose major theme in many of his films is to make the audience
feel "human" emotions for alien "contraptions" (E.T., dinausors, etc.).

All I am saying is that I do not think that the issue of the relationship
between human and computer is basically technical or even symbolic. These
are historical, technological and even cognitive developments to which the
human must develop a metaphysical response.

As for the "ghost in the machine," which I discussed with Patrick in a
related post. The traditional, at least the Western/Christian, view is that
the ghost (the soul) is eternal, and the body (the material) is mortal,
ephemeral, the counter-argument being that they are the same (Jim's and
maybe Patrick's view). It seems to me facts point to a different direction.
It is the physical (the body) which is eternal. While the person dies, the
material of its body survives, in endless transformations. That is what
science tells us. What is actually mortal is consciousness (the soul). That
may be why, in Buddhism, Nirvana is a state of consciouness post
transformations (reincarnations), a little bit like "classless society" in
Marxism.

Of course, Judaism has a different approach. Forget about the soul
(after-life). Deal with the ethics of individual, social consciousness (e,g.
always health, parental respect, etc., coming before ritual, or code).

Ciao,

Murat

With Holiday cheer to all--
some simply fun speculations--

     An aspect among a seemingly endless numbr of them I find interesting in
this disucssion is that there are two movements which are approaching each
other in a very interesting interface/overlapping.  That is, on the one hand
there is a century plus exploration of the ways in hich humans can be
mechanized--made more and more machin-like in behaviours at work and in
institutions, armies, etc etc and on the other the development towards
artificial inteliigence--machines will become more and more human-like (we
speculate).  The underlying drive of both tendenies is a dream of in some
way "perfecting" the human by means of the machine.  Alredy with the
development of prostheses one finds limbs and organ etc which can fucntion
"better" in many way than th otiriginals.  One can envision people with the
financial means and acdcess as they age--and we are approaching the ever
greater explosion of the baby boom into the aging boom in many soceities
already--the rich wil be able to keep supplying thesmelves with ever more up
to date and better replacement parts, becoming more and more "artificially
human" while stil retaining something of their "personal identity".
artificial intelligence--one can envision being used to replace grandpa's
fading mind--all sorts of possibilities there.
       A blurring of the mechanized human and humanized mechnical is
something we are aready seeing underway.  (One can imgigne used parts stores
popular among the not so well off, and black market in particularly prized
parts . . . as well as bootlegged versions of both prostheses and various
forms of AI at some point  . . . )
     The drive towards a perfectability --isn't this an ancient dream?
Somehow being human is at once the pinnacle of evolution and yet inadequate,
"we are only using one fifth of our potenetial" to "realize ourselves" as
one often reads.  "By any means necesary" to work to be the first, or the
leaders, in attaining ever greater degrees of potentialities.
      The question of relating with machines is a surprsing one, becuase for
quite some time humans have had intesne relationships with machines that
they employ, live with, create with, that their dreams are made with so to
speak.  People relate intesnely with a particualr car or keyboard, a
particlar coffe maker, etc etc etc racing drivers, for example (a number of
themi n my family) have literally a life and death relationship with their
car in which it is like a being they have to be on the most intimate terms
with, "I know my car better than my wife or even myself" a relative said.
"And it knows me better."
     Remember the film "The Stepford Wives"?  The human wife too much of a
drag--these proto-androids far preferable.  End of women's liberation.
(William Burroughs, who also wrote a versionof Blade Runner--would often in
interviews dvocate a future i which women were no longer necessary.  Not
even Stepford Wives.)  Certains elements of the populace are necessary and
enjoyable as long as they don't create al those awful human probelms they
have?  Replace them with replicants who act and live just like them, do
everything the same, except make the demands the troblesome humans did.
     (A great forerunner of this kind of vision is Poe's short piece
"Morning on the Wissahicaon" which puns on "mourning"--a colonized simulacra
of "American wilderness" replacing it for the tourist, and doing so so well
that American himself is taken in until told the truh later.)
      Paul Virilio in "Pure War" quotes Malrux:  "What makes humans
different is the ability to say no."  (As in Ionesco's Rhinoceros--the "no"
goes against the grain of what sems logically yes to everyone else.  )
It's perfectly plausble that that kind of "no" can be left out of what an
artifical intelligence is given to "know".
     I think th possiblities of "mixing" are very interesting --that is, of
what we already have with mixing of ever more technologically improved
prothetics with humans, and of various forms of artificail inelligence with
humans--our use right now of these machines to communicate with each
other--makes me begin to wonder of a future i which there is a mixing of
human and android--I'm of mixed race as ever more people are, so this is a
possibility also to consider.
     A proverb from Brazil which makes me leery of any improvement in
classlessness via artifical intelligence is "When shit is worth money, the
poor will be born without assholes."  An artifical intelligenc may not be
able to distinguish among humans in this way--yet as long as there are
humans are around it, they wil make sure that it does.
     Even ihen all are created perfect--there are bound to be some who are
more perfect than others to their way of being perfect.
     Unless a very great deal of what is "human" can be non-programmed into
artifical intelligence.  Yet, who is to say that as an artifical
intelligence gathers awarenes of the situation, it will not see that indeed,
it is "better" than the flawed humans?
       All the problens which human have already with ethics, laws,
relgions, philosphies, ownership, nations, idenities, etc--of course there
is the drive for a perfecting of the human via some other mean than ones as
yet tried.  But then--whose perfection?  Which versions get programmed in to
A1?
     I'm just suggesting these various ideas from a a purely speculative
point of view--I don't know the mathematics and other backgrounds, so don't
mean this to be taken in the same line of thinking, but to the side, since
speculations and speculative examples have already been introduced, and they
are indeed limitless when one begins to riff on them.
      I've worked around and with several kinds of aniumals over the years,
and the one I endlessly find inpsiring is the cat.  Cats live among humans
now for tens of thousands of years--they respond to one emotionally, become
invovled in human life in a very full way--yet they can also stil go out the
door and enter an other world--a wild feline world of hunting, terriitorail
control, instincts which lead them to break rules tuaght them by humans--and
they are not Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde--this is all a flow along the continuum
of their being.  The cat knows how to live very well "at home" with its
human family--and knows how to live outside, on the streets or in "the
wild".  In their own way cats have also an ability to say "no".  If i think
abou living in a scoeity of replicants or more and more technologized
humans--I think of the cat.  There's an interesting lesson in there for
"human survival"!  Become a liminal being!
     The mixed, the liminal--these I find too often left out of the more
either/or kinds of discussions dealing with humans/artifical intelligence.
      (Too much either/or--what happens to both/and? After all, cats were
nearly completely exteminated from western europe at one point.)
       And yet--with the overlappings going on--what are going to be seen as
"good" kinds of both/and and "bad" kinds?  There is right there stil the
idea of some being more perfect than other, more equal than others etc--
        As Francois Villon wrote:  "I cheer up in sad despair".

"The Second Coming" by W.B. Yeats (1920)


Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.

Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?


Merry Christmas! PP

"Searle points out that if we know the internal workings of the entity, then
ascribing understanding or consciousness to it is indeed problematical."

Where?  I've not seen him say as much.  Regardless, neither the Chinese
Room experiment nor any arguments in _The Rediscovered Mind_ appear to
support that claim.

Please forgive me for what could seem mean-spirited.  I mean no harm or
insult.  It's just that it appears to me from your response that you
have taken select pieces from a complex set of arguments responding to
even more complex mathematical systems, oversimplified those select
pieces, and reassembled them to derive orthogonal concepts designed only
to support your beliefs about matters that share some terms in common
with their origins.  You do not appear to be arguing with Searle because
you do not appear to me at least to be accurately paraphrasing even the
basics.

I do heartily encourage you to further explore and study the body of
John Searle's work.  His work is quite remarkable and quite accessible
to non-experts. JL Austin I think would be very proud.

Best of luck to you.

It is a travesty that experimental poetry has retreated into a niche and is
not read for fully. This is mostly the fault of experimental poets because
of the publishing structure that exists they do not need to seek audience
because sales do not determine publication- selling out? Who was a bigger
sell out? Stein, Pound? Or Creeley? Poets need to survive how they do it is
not our concern what matters is that they create good and great poems and
challenge the existing structure/

That was really heartwarming!

The two hug-givers definitely surpassed their hug-quota that day!  I wonder

I also hold a treasured memory of James Brown headlining at the Apollo in
the mid-sixties, especially the unforgettably unique close to his act; he
fell to the stage again and again, each time an assistant running out to him
in mock alarm,  tossing still another silver or gold robe over him, and
each time JB throwing off the robe, jumping up and playing a further encore.
This continued for what must have been 30 minutes or more.
The legend was that once JB had actually passed out from exhaustion during a
performance and had then memorialized this occasion in future performances.
This is ineradicable inspiration.

Actually, Patrick, my arguments against Searle's conclusion are not
original. Jason pointed out the 'system argument', and that is basically the
argument I am making. We see it stated at
http://atheism.about.com/library/glossary/general/bldef_searle.htm , for
instance. And it is stated, variously, on many pages on the Web.

"A number of objections have been raised about his conclusion, including the
idea that while the room is supposed to be analogous to a computer, then the
room should also be analogous to the entire brain. Thus, although the
individual in the room does not understand Chinese, neither do any of the
individual cells in our brains. A person's understanding of Chinese is an
emergent property of the brain and not a property possessed by any one part.
Similarly, understanding is an emergent property of the entire system
contained in the room, even though it is not a property of any one component
in the room - person, book, or paper."

So perhaps you could productively counter the system argument, which I
stated also in my original reply to you.

By the way, I don't believe Searle is a mathematician, and I don't see any
complex mathematical systems involved in the Chinese Room 'thought
experiment', contrary to your assertion. Also, the arguments against
Searle's conclusion generally involve pointing out that it is he who is
engaged in simplification.

Merry Christmas, Patrick. Let's keep it friendly and to the point, OK?

Good question, Cory. I'm not so sure we can call these bad
translations. Certainly they describe things, dishes, directions,
warnings... that are particular to a culture and language which is
not the one you or I come from, and their strangeness may be an
indication of their difference. The way these translations affect us
(though we sometimes chuckle our way out of it) may be a kind of
alienation affect that reflects that difference, and our discomfort
with being illiterate in a strange land.

I don't know that it's entirely possible or desirable to distinguish
between found text and poetry, not to mention "great poetry",
although it can be interesting and productive to think about these
categories and their intersection, the slippages and erosion of such
classifications. What is original poetry, or language?
.
As for the credit, perhaps it belongs to language(s) and their
intersections.

New WNY Lit Paper Calls for Submissions:

Heralding the Art of Words in Western New York...
THE OTHER HERALD


12/09/06

Dear Poetics Members:

Good Saturday Morning! I would like to introduce you to a new monthly
literary publication: The Other Herald. This publication offers you as
the writer/reader a friendly partnership with others who endeavor to
connect/support/grow/showcase writers of Western New York and beyond.
We are currently accepting submissions for our third and fourth issues,
as per details below.

------------------------------------------------------------------
The Other Herald publishes good POETRY, short articles on creativity
and the writing life, WNY events listings, Woman Poet column by
Virginia Lee Hines, fun writing exercises, unique submissions
opportunities, Etsy.com artist of the month, writers' "field trips"
scheduled, and much more!
------------------------------------------------------------------

Especially, it is our intention at TOH to reach those who may not

are subject to the isolation of small-town living, some who suffer from
intense self-judgment, those confined to nursing home residence, young
adults who are often ignored by publishers and so need such
encouragement to grow...

monthly. Will you spread the word? Do you have something to add?
Suggestions and other contributions to the publication, such as events

Re: Slouching towards Bethlehem

Peter's accompaniment to the below poem seems quite fitting. There =20
seem to be many interpretations of this poem, online and otherwise, =20
such as with the best of poems. Difficult subject matter is always fun =20
to approach, and he has done it quite well. Art with words embedded in =20
it always catches my eye, in a special way... being a writer at heart. =20

P.S. Cheers! Have a merry time, everyone, with the "changing of the =20
years" in sight!


THE POEM:

W. B. Yeats - The Second Coming

Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in the sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?


1920

Fuckn Brilliant!

Is there any chance that you might be able to offer
some advice, minor assistance, on some work I'm doing.
For example, I've just gotten two vispo poems into
Otoliths - and while pleased, I am certain that my
knowledge of such programs as Gimp, for example,
leaves the work, however good, a shade away from the
finished - really exquisiteness, of your own!

Heidegger's Hut

poised among the fourfold, the lure of new man, new development, and yet...
closer to fourfold, among uncounted elements, unaccounted-for. For often I have
approached this live or in dream to little avail; I would wait for clearing
weather, for the world to happen, for technology to disappear at the base.
Heidegger remains there above his troubled politics, of which there is no
counting-four; we are close to hearth, we are embers among the dying worlds.
Soon the snows will melt, glaciers disappear; the hut stays on a lure,
overlooking resettled life, spaces a thousand kilometers long, an empyrean
high. I cannot imagine a world such as this, life in hut corner, close to
warmth, old wooden bench and bed, columnar spirit emerging to heavens' other
worlds. We live in imaginary solace, his hut our own, released to the elements
and beyond, transformed. There is no journey in the journey, no dream in the
dream. One has life only for so much sorrow. Glow remains the last of our eyes.
Hearth warms, beyond.

i am not particularly optimistic about what would happen were we to create
machines with the sort of flexible intelligences humans possess. i am not
particularly optimistic about what we do with human intelligence either.

but i do think it's important that we be able to argue publicly about these
and other things. after 150 years, there is widespread scientific concensus
that while the theory of evolution is still incomplete in its specification
of the nature, mechanisms, and timeline of evolution, nonetheless, it is
profoundly more explanatory a theory of our origins and even our future than
myths that we were created 5000 years ago by God, and that we looked much
the same then as now, yada yada. It is sad, very sad that the theory of the
origin and evolution of species is not more widely accepted than it
is--particularly in the USA.

the idea that it has been established that there are thought processes of
which humans are capable and computers are not is simply false. it is sad
that so many believe the contrary. it is as sad as the way that the theory
of the origin and evolution of species is rejected by so many. it may indeed
turn out that there are such thought processes--it hasn't been established
that there are absolutely no thought processes of which humans are capable
and computers are not. it is an open question.

in both cases, it's widely believed that acceptance of the scientific theory
diminishes humanity. i don't think that's true. but even if it were true, we
are obliged, not by our seeking of perfection (if indeed we are), but by our
being seekers of truth, to discover the truth of our origins and nature. we
don't need to put our eyes out.

Andrea Dworkin, who has (had) impeccable feminist and Jewish
credentials, had quite a lot to say about women and Israel, and she
doesdn't agree at all. Her very interesting take in an article in Ms
Magazine http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/IsraelI.html

I'm with Mark here; this "equal time" thing is rubbish. A crime is a
crime no matter who does it, and if Bob robs a house that doesn't
absolve Ben.  I seem to see an awful lot about evil Arab regimes in
the press, so I don't know why it's claimed that they are never talked
about. People sometimes seem to talk about nothing else.

John Berger is one of my heroes ("Our Faces My Heart as Brief as
Photos" is one of the most beautiful books I know).  But that doesn't
stop me feeling very ambivalent about the whole idea of an artistic
boycott.  I can understand the reasons why it might be suggested, but
I don't know how it will actually make a difference (the cricket ban
on South Africa _did_ make a difference, and did hurt South Africa,
but how can this - not coming from a centralised world body, say - do
the same thing or have the same effect?) And I'm not convinced it
wouldn't be counterproductive. I can't get past the notion that art
desires to communicate past all these barriers,  and to close off its
possibilities seems to me a terrible thing. Maybe it's expressive of
how despairing artists feel, if they're prepared to suggest such a
thing.

All best

Alison

Evoltional theory  is culturally based in monotheism, which is what
makes it falter and easy to attack... A less teleological approach is
perhaps necessary. If you read Dawkin, one can quite easily replace

Yes, evolutionists have a hard time steering away from teleological thinking, which is fundamentally religious.

Ruth,

-- thank you for posting this --  yeah i agree with you on globalization had
friends at the WTO protests in Seattle back then -- which may not at all be
what you mean -- but globalization's effects on world poverty, i agree with
you, are negative -- over one billion people live on less than $1 a day --
and the strengthening of international corporate ties just -- actively --
diverts resources away from them -- destroys the language which could
describe all of it

-- i apologize for my sarcastic remark -- i appreciate your posts on the
list and am always glad to read them

What are you talking about? Evolutionary theory describes a
mechanism, not a purpose.

Israel Bombs Anti-Semitism Out Of Lebanon

December 18, 2006 | Issue 42=E2=80=A251

After decades of periodic conflict with Lebanon that cost thousands of li=
ves, Israel successfully eradicated all traces of anti-Semitism from its =
northern neighbor with a series of heavy bombing attacks in July.

"Israel really turned us around on the whole Jew-hating thing," said Hezb=
ollah leader Sheikh Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, shortly after a U.N.=E2=80=93=
brokered ceasefire was declared on Aug. 14. "After destroying much of our=
 infrastructure and displacing nearly 1 million civilians, we've come to =
respect Israel as a legitimate power and a beacon of democracy, and not a=
 pack of lying, usurping, hook-nosed dogs."
Israel Bombs R

NEW BEGINNINGS
Now unencumbered by hate or bitterness, Lebanese men walk through the rub=
ble of their former apartment buildings.

The last-ever Israel=E2=80=93Lebanon conflict began on July 12, when Hezb=
ollah militants launched Katyusha missiles into Northern Israel, killed t=
hree Israeli soldiers, and kidnapped two others. Despite this initial suc=
cess, Israel eventually prevailed in ridding the majority-Arab nation of =
a pervasive prejudice, the roots of which extend to Phoenician times.

Many in the international community were greatly surprised by the develop=
ment. "We assumed this was just another regional war of attrition, a shor=
t-term, semi-effective defensive measure at best, a conflict-feeding 'eye=
 for an eye' tactic at worst," French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Bl=
azy said. "But we see that we were being far too cynical. It's basically =
resolved now."

Strobe Talbott, president of the Brookings Institution, a Washington=E2=80=
=93based think tank, said that there was "very strong" evidence that not =
only was a virulent anti-Jewish sentiment completely wiped out in Israel'=
s bombing campaign against Lebanon, but so was any hard-line political op=
position to Israel's existence or its annexing of the West Bank, Gaza Str=
ip, and Golan Heights following the Six-Day War in 1967, and general ange=
r over Israel's treatment of Palestinians.

"It's remarkable to think that, had Hezbollah been capable of making surg=
ical pre-emptive strikes against Israeli military installations and dense=
ly populated urban centers, Israel would most likely be renouncing Zionis=
m and abandoning the region at this very moment," Talbott said in August.=


The bombings have had the most significant impact on Lebanon's youth. Man=
y who saw parents and friends killed in the attacks said they will now sp=
end the rest of their lives supporting Israel.

"I was upset at first when a bomb destroyed my school and killed many of =
my schoolmates and left me without legs," said Tyre bombing victim Sherif=
a Ayoub, 14, as she wheeled down her rubble-strewn street. "But as the da=
ys went on, and the bombs continued to fall, I began to realize that I ha=
d spent my whole young life arbitrarily lashing out at a people I thought=
 I hated, when, all along, what I really hated was myself."

Israel's crushing victory has led Talbott and other Mideast experts to sp=
eculate that the nation may go on to bomb the anti-Semitism out of such h=
ostile neighbors as Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen.

Andrea Dworkin, who has (had) impeccable feminist and Jewish
credentials, had quite a lot to say about women and Israel, and she
doesdn't agree at all. Her very interesting take in an article in Ms
Magazine http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/IsraelI.html

I'm with Mark here; this "equal time" thing is rubbish. A crime is a
crime no matter who does it, and if Bob robs a house that doesn't
absolve Ben.  I seem to see an awful lot about evil Arab regimes in
the press, so I don't know why it's claimed that they are never talked
about. People sometimes seem to talk about nothing else.

John Berger is one of my heroes ("Our Faces My Heart as Brief as
Photos" is one of the most beautiful books I know).  But that doesn't
stop me feeling very ambivalent about the whole idea of an artistic
boycott.  I can understand the reasons why it might be suggested, but
I don't know how it will actually make a difference (the cricket ban
on South Africa _did_ make a difference, and did hurt South Africa,
but how can this - not coming from a centralised world body, say - do
the same thing or have the same effect?) And I'm not convinced it
wouldn't be counterproductive. I can't get past the notion that art
desires to communicate past all these barriers,  and to close off its
possibilities seems to me a terrible thing. Maybe it's expressive of
how despairing artists feel, if they're prepared to suggest such a
thing.

All best

What a wonderful prose poem to read first on a Wednesday morning, Christmas finally being out of the way for another year.  Thank you very much.

This is simply the same old misunderstanding of what evolution is all
about that the religious types always put forward: they cannot, and
will not, understand the actual theory of evolution. They keep trying
to say things such as that any mechanism requires a mechanic: if a
watch then a watchmaker, if a design, then a designer. But in fact
evolution is a random process, not a designed mechanism. It's an
evolved mechanism, not a designed one -- or so we theorize. The
evidence that we have argues overwhelmingly in favor of the theory,
even though we have to admit we don't know all the ways the mechanism
works because the time-scales on which the mechanism works is so much
longer than any human point of view.

Human knowledge is, of course, theory-laden. We do design cars as
mechanisms that imply purpose and, sometimes, destination. But human-
designed mechanisms are different in kind, not merely in degree, from
the sorts of mechanisms we posit, such as gravity, electro-magnetism,
quantum mechanics, Newtonian physics, and evolution, among many
others, to explain why things in nature work the way they do.

The notion that evolution is a discredited product of imperialist
masculine victorian pseudoscience is a postmodern ideology, not a
rational critique.

here's the core paragraph from the Dworking piece Alison cited:

"In Israel, Jewish women are basically--in reality, in everyday life--=20=

governed by Old Testament law. So much for equality of the sexes. The =20=

Orthodox rabbis make most of the legal decisions that have a direct =20
impact on the status of women and the quality of women's lives. They =20
have the final say on all issues of "personal status," which =20
feminists will recognize as the famous private sphere in which =20
civilly subordinate women are traditionally imprisoned. The Orthodox =20
rabbis decide questions of marriage, adultery, divorce, birth, death, =20=

legitimacy; what rape is; and whether abortion, battery, and rape in =20
marriage are legal or illegal."

Which basically makes the plight of women in Israel very similar to =20
that of than in traditional (i.e. most) Arab countries.

That's the cartoon version, and has more to do with the use of the
idea than the idea itself, something like using Einstein to back
statements like "it's all relative." Darwin, for one, wasn't happy
with "social Darwinism."  Biological Darwinism, on the other hand,
has been possible to explain more fully, but it has thus far been
impossible to attack successfully, though it's of course possible for
those coming at it with a warring a priori to deny it.

Darwin's cultural context, by the way, was selective breeding. Note
that he called his theory evolution by natural selection. It has
survived the wider context of its time, when many misused it for
their own purposes.

Biological evolution is a pretty simple idea, and it assumes
accident, not purpose. Populations that have a hard time rearing
children to the age of reproduction tend to lose out to populations
that have an easier time. Once child-rearing is over, say at age 40
for humans, the rest of the lifespan has considerably less impact on
the passing on of genes. Genetic variation happens
constantly--mutations, which are genetic accidents, are generated by
the millions. Most seem to have no effect at all, many result in
early death, and a few promote survival  for that crucial 40 years.
When conditions change a neutral mutation may suddenly promote
survival in the new conditions (even a mutation with pretty nasty
effects, like sickle-cell, may be passed on to large numbers because
it conveys a survival benefit in a particular circumstance).

Here's an example. Among most mammals the genes that produce the
enzymes that allow milk to be tolerated  switch off after infancy.
Otherwise adult horses would nurse. But in some individuals the gene
isn't switched off, which means they remain tolerant of milk as
adults. A thoroughly neutral mutation until some humans started
herding animals for meat, and, coincidentally, large quantities of
milk became available to those who could drink it. In pastoral
populations those who could tolerate milk found themselves with an
enormously expanded protein supply, and in short order by
evolutionary standards they survived childhood in greatly increased
numbers and passed on the mutation to their offspring. Which is why
the distribution of the mutation is uneven--in cultures that aren't
recently descended from herders of goats and cows the percentage of
adult lactose-intolerance is very high, and in cultures descended
from milk-drinking pastoralists it's very low. This is an
evolutionary change that's happened in the last 7000 years.

Note that each population, the lactose-tolerant and the
lactose-intolerant, has been pretty successful, but by different
means. It's difficult to see how anyone could attach a purpose to
this. It's also difficult to see a gender-bias at work.

Whatever else gets said about this will be without my participation.
I've used up my two messages. Which is to say, don't mistake silence
for acquiescence.

Hi Pierre and thanks Alison for this striking! article. i didn't know abt
the pornography--so upsetting, tho w/ much of the rest I'm familiar. Am
forwarding this to my Israeli cousins and to some left-wing friends &
thinking abt it myself. Still, women can leave their houses and work and
vote and drive etc--I'm not saying that then all the other things are ok. O=
f
course now in the US porn has become normalized in part due to some major
networks. When I think of my given identity I think first I am a woman bec
that defines me most. My thought abt porn is that it objectifies so by its
very nature keeps us from seeing people esp women as fully human--before we
even get into the violence issue, which may actually come in part from
objectification. Yes, Pierre, of course you are right that the personal is
the most political, the 'cultural' is female, the political male.

Several yrs ago I emailed Adrienne Rich--see her great poem Yom Kippur 1984
(also in my anthology of poems from Sojourner) abt  being in the world as a
women/jew/lesbian, wanting to travel, feeling like the other. I had seen th=
e
remake summer movie of Charlie's Angels w/ some friends who sd afterwards
that was fun, the women were powerful. But they were totally sexual objects=
,
I thought. So I asked AR, Do you feel happy that women have made such
progress in certain areas in the US or upset that all over the world women
are still treated unbearably badly & in the US in certain ways very badly?
She wrote back something to the effect that one cd hardly be optimstic in a
country w/ a regime that rules by violence & that her solace was to go to
web sites every day of Israeli & Palestinian women working for peace. And
she sent me to some of those web sites--they were wonderful but so
idealistic/ wout a hope of actually making peace, it seemed to me, but mayb=
e
the act itself is essential.

I know that I feel better when I am 'pro-active'--that awful word --& think
I can do anything I want in this world & feel perky but I am more honest
when I know I cannot & that I need to keep fighting for women's rights all
over the world in this supposedly 'post-feminist' world. See Rich's still
applicable great essay "On Lies, Secrets & Silence".I know that men I knew
in the 60s are reading this post & I can't imagine what they are thinking!

I have three ideas for web journals I'm considering launching, but, I

Please take a moment to review the following proposals and reply

appropriate to the focus of one or more of these.

Thank you in advance for your time.

1) Close Readings -- Pick a poem, any poem, and go through it with a
   fine-toothed mental comb and share your
   understandings/observations/criticism. For an archetypal example of
   what I'd be looking for, please see Charles Alexander's close
   reading of Elizbeth Bishop posted to the SUNY-Buffalo Poetics list
   in April of this year at http://tinyurl.com/w3elu

2) Instantiation -- I'd be looking to publish statements of poetics,
   manifestos, mission statements, or even loosely structured goals
   for the pieces side-by-side with examples of poems which realize
   (or attempt to realize) the statements.

3) subgenre -- And for this one I'm not really looking for authors,
   I'm looking for editors willing to provide content in their chosen
   narrowed range. I am open to a nearly unlimited set of narrowed
   ranges--if what you do puts in you contact with a steady stream of
   some particular kind of poem and you feel you could manage to
   select one for featuring every month or so, then I'm looking for
   you. As a starting point, consider the following: concrete poetry,
   visual poetry, lyric poetry, formal poetry, haiku, doggerel,
   digital poetry, poetry in translation, language poetry. But do not
   be limited by these. Your ability to provide an example a month is
   sufficient to declare it a viable category.

I have the resources to do all of the above if the interest is
there. If the interest is not there, I'll cross these off my "would
like to do" list and move on.

There is no need to reply if you just want to express interest in
being a reader of these journals--if they come to pass I'll make
regular announcements to these lists. At this time I'm only looking
for people interested in the possibilities of providing content.

Please feel free to forward this email on to any people or lists you
feel would be interested.

Regards,
Dan

Fantastic work. I went through your entire website, also saw more of =
your beautiful images on your blog. The "g dying" knocked me out.  I =
also do web design; I found the simple elegance of your site very =
inspiring.

The Searle Chinese Room 'thought experiment' purports to illustrate that the
Turing test for intelligence is insufficient, that something else is
involved in intelligence that the Turing test does not acknowledge or deal
with, and we can tell whether it's there or not by looking at the internal
workings of the entity.

I won't restate the CR 'thought experiment' or the Turing test but point you
to them if you're not familiar with either:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searle%27s_Chinese_room and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test .

Searle points out that the scenario he sets up does not involve
understanding of Chinese. Searle says that even if the Turing test is
passed, there can be no true intelligence without understanding; the
scenario does not admit of understanding existing anywhere in the scenario.

I have elaborated, in various posts, on an objection to Searle's conclusion
called the 'systems response' in the literature. It is the position that
things such as understanding and consciousness are emergent behaviors of the
whole system/brain. This position points out that the functioning of the
brain, at a neurological, chemical level is as mindless as the Searle
scenario, and that understanding and consciousness, etc, cannot be located
in any specific set of brain cells or part of the brain but are properties
of the virtual machine, as it were.

What is a 'virtual machine'? Let me give you a distinctly unprofound
example. Some friends and myself are recovering some computer poetry by
bpNichol that he created with an Apple IIe in 1983-84. We have the DSK file
from his project. This file was read by the Apple IIe and turned into the
animated poetry. But of course hardly anyone has an Apple IIe anymore.
Luckily, there are downloadable emulators of the Apple IIe that run on
contemporary PCs or Macs. An emulator reads the DSK file and displays the
animated poetry just like the Apple IIe did. The emulator is a virtual
machine. It is 'virtual' because it is not a physical machine. It is a
machine because it processes the DSK files just like the Apple IIe.

So, you see, there can be machines that are virtual. And they can be very
strange. We can, for instance, imagine a virtual machine whose code is not
on the physical machine. Instead, the physical machine can contain code that
writes the code of the virtual machine.

Imagine, then, on the physical machine, programs that write or edit code
that, when executed, creates the virtual machine. And the code of the
virtual machine may contain code that can modify the physical machine's
code.

This is the sort of thing it means to say that things like understanding and
consciousness are emergent behaviors of the overall system.

Searle can of course be forgiven for being ignorant of this sort of
possibility of computing. It isn't obvious. The idea is that consciousness
emerges from a sufficiently complex system of self and world monitoring.

In a sense, it is as tricky as formulating the mechanisms of evolution
without introducing a designer.

while a cultural boycott may not have a great deal of appeal, certainly one
is confronted with the question what to do in a non-violent way for peace
Israeli and Palestinian peace activists, in environments hostile to them,
are inspiring for their courage and insights--and their confronting hard
truths of their realities--rather than bow to great pressures--
friends from other countries write and ask, what do americans, esp artists
and writers think about this?  do they all support the Bush government's
position?--are they against war in Iraq but for it in Lebanon and Palestine?
is Iran next--maybe with a nuke?--do you still have freedom of speech
there?--etc etc etc--why don't more people speak out?--


the announcement of the building of a new settlement for the first time in
10 years against international law and against promise made to the
US--doesn't sound much like a peace process
(this isn't counting the huge numbers of illegal even under Israeli law
settlements and
proto-settlements that continually are erected, staking out land, or the
"thickening" process going on in the already existing settlements)

"There was no such things as Palestinians; they never existed."
Golda Maier, 15 June 1969 interview, London Times

(the library at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee is the Golda Maier
Library;  she lived here and attended school for several years)

new Deputy Prime Minister of Israel, Avigdor Lieberman, long time advocate
of ethnic cleansing, last week on radio called for the killing of every
single member of the Palestinian government

two new books i'd  recommend, a video, some sites--
note the people involved in all listed here are peace activists and all but
Desmond Tutu are Israelis
no matter how dire and brutal the situation and what may well be on the
way--these are people who still believe in and hope for peace--
they have the great  courage to speak out in their country, with the hope
others will speak out in theirs
Bishop Tutu notes that in America many are scared to speak out
what does that say about our country and its vaunted freedom of speech?
ever since 9/11 so many reasons to play it SAFE  (security, after all--above
all--)
a very slippery slope
one day one may find oneself also asking "could you live here?"--(title of
video below)--

"the first casualty of war is language"--in many different senses of the
term--"casualty"--now known as "collateral damage" unless a solider--
                                                             recommended--

The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine  by Ilan Pappe  (Oxford, 2006)

makes use of recently available Israeli documents; 1947/8-the present

The author is an Israeli historian and Senior Lecturer of Political Science
at Haifa University, Academic Director of Research Institute for Peace at
Givat Haviva, Chair of the Emil Touma Institute for Palestinian Studies,
Haifa

He is an advocate of academic and cultural boycott

The Road Map to Nowhere Israel/Palestine Since 2003 by Tanya Renhart
(Verso, 2006)

"to maintain Gaza as a closed prison, transform the West Bank into a system
of sealed enclaves and annex Palestinian land under cover of construction of
'Seperation Wall'"

this is a follow up to Renhart's

Israel/Palestine  How to End the War of 1948  (NY:  Seven Stories, 2002; 2nd
edition)

(the suggested ending being as near as possible complete cleansing of
Palestinians from the land, creating a Greater Israel)

Tanya Renhart is Professor Emeritus of Linguistics and Comparative
Literature at Tel Aviv Univerrsity and guest lecturer at the University of
Utrecht;  regular columnist for Yediot Aharonot and contributor to
Counterpunch

at one point describes a peace march of Israeli and Palestinian women, many
carrying signs.  They are met with tear gas followed by an assault carried
out by police on horseback weilding batons and clubbing everyone they can to
the ground. Peace marches forbidden to be in the streets, or have
signs--must stand on side of road quietly.

most densely populated area in the world, poorest or next to poorest
population in Northern hemisphere
the little girl may be easy to dismiss for  some as insanely millions of
children everyday under threat of attacks--
what is different is when you see through windows, over a roof and through a
screened in fencing tanks sitting at the ready for an assault; a prison with
armed guards so to speak and planes can be called in at a moment's notice
now pilots no longer have to obey "Lebanon" procedure, (from first Lebanon
war, not always observed) in which if a pilot saw civilians within 500 foot
square area of target, not to fire;  now fire at will since last summer's
invasion of Lebanon-
firing into such a densely populated area, held prisoner, no escape--"like
shooting fish in a barrel"
statement by Palestinian psychologist after studying one thousand
children--psychological damage so bad many have lost the will to live
in effect, they have already been killed--
so what does it matter then if their bodies are finished off--
they're dead anyway, right?--

the only places i have seen like this, minus the tanks and some of the
fences, though not all--some American Indian reservations--the gardening and
farming lands taken away, no water, trees all cut down for
settlements-nothing left but despair--

Java Beans is a component architecture
for Java.  It's finally a little later.
Winter hits us strangely here on
the Black  River, green and snaked

 with disease. Everyone's coughing
as they wait  in line for
the guillotine. My quills
adrift in liquors distilled  from
everything else. I'd gladly

 trade my foreground with your
background, if  only a little later
you'd hold me as I shook the rain
from my head.  Rolling off
the hot tin roof, I'm a fool to believe

 that subclassing the atmosphere
and parsing the  distances between
myself and other people will ever

 stop me from eating the centers from
everyone I  love.

Subtext continues its monthly series of experimental writing with readings
by
Paul Hoover & Maxine Chernoff at Richard Hugo House on Wednesday, January 3,
2007.  Donations for admission will be taken at the door on the evening of
the
performance.  The reading starts at 7:30pm. 

Paul Hoover has published eleven books of poetry, most recently Edge and
Fold
(Apogee Press, 2006) and Poems in Spanish (Omnidawn, 2005), which was
nominated
for the Bay Area Book Award in poetry.  He is editor of the anthology
Postmodern
American Poetry (Norton, 1994) and, with Maxine Chernoff, of the literary
magazine New American Writing.  His collection of literary essays, Fables of
Representation, was published by University of Michigan Press in 2004. With
Nguyen Do, he has translated an anthology of contemporary Vietnamese poetry,
and
the selected poems of the great ancient poet Nguyen Trai.  With Maxine
Chernoff,
he has translated Selected Poems of Friedrich Holderlin, which will appear

literary journal New American Writing.  She is the author of six books of
fiction and eight books of poetry, most recently Among the Names (Apogee
Press,
2005), of which Cole Swenson said, "Among the Names [creates] a vast and
layered
network, in short, an economy.  Exploring complexities of 'the gift,'
Chernoff's
is an economy of the uncanny- each exchange is strikingly new."  Her
collection
of stories, Signs of Devotion, was a NYT Notable Book of 1993. Both her
novel
American Heaven and her book of short stories, Some of Her Friends That
Year,
were finalists for the Bay Area Book Reviewers Award.  Her novel A Boy in
Winter
is currently in production in Canada by an independent film company. With

"You understand nothing of my schemes, Penguin..."

A mighty tale in three chapters, featuring a megalomaniac frog, a =

shutting-up phrases and an insatiable lust for mints!=20

The day before Xmas, the Space channel ran three of the 'Planet of the Apes'
films. I guess those would be the sci-fi pieces that play on the future and
evolution in the prominent sort of way Bladerunner works with the future and
AI.

In those movies, the stature of the characters has nothing to do with
whether they are human or ape but whether they act ethically and can
perceive in others, be they ape or human, whether they are trustworthy.

Possibly. It is not uncommon in literature, film, or poetry for the audience
to be shown 'the outsider' acting in good faith as a moral agent, earning
our sympathy. Probably dramas of this nature have gone a long way to
changing the way many people feel.

Apologies; I haven't seen it. I saw E.T.

I remember when I saw Men In Black. I was living in Seattle (I'm from
Canada). It seems many people didn't see it as playing on USAmerican
attitudes to foreigners, but surely it was. We don't have to have Martians
to have aliens.

Actually, my feeling is that I don't know if anything lives forever.

To wonder about this question is something we might share with just about
every sentient being that has ever been. Ones that die, in any case. To
wonder what becomes of us after we die. This sort of wondering is what lives
as long as sentient beings live and die. It is our own experience but
everyone has it. Which is to say it is part of what being a mortal sentient
being involves, whether one is human or from the furthest star.

Should sentient beings be created from software, I suspect they also would
wonder about life and death.

When did Globalization and Exploitation not exist?

For 3.4 Million years people have been migrating,conquering and exploiting-
diseases have been decimatng people, languages have been dieing and people
have been exploited this is the human condition; or is evolution no longer
politically correct?

Do we have to pretend that we are not beneficiaries of Globalization? All
people alive today are beneficiaries of someone elses' exploitation. You can
delude yourself into believing it is is not so but we are.

Europe's seed money (all of it) came from Peruvian, Bolivian and Mexican
metals torn from the ground using Native slave labor.

Much of the Arab world's riches before Oil came from the Slave Trade slavery
built Baghdad, Granada and Cairo.

The Riches of the USA come from Chattel slavery and Native Genocide- this is
the way the world has worked since the Cro Magnon's exterminated the
Neanderthals.

All the hand wringing about "justice" is usually by people who are in the
elite; the fact that we are actually posting on the Buffalo List confirms
that we are privilaged and rich because the poor are not able to get
internet access.

But the underdog eventually becomes the upper dog over and over again. In
the year 1000 the leading cultures were China, India, Persia, Arabic, Maya
and Malian; in 1900 the Europeans were the leading cultures and in 2100? I
would bet on China and India. But you know history has a funny way of
changing things- China is ascendent- India is growing, Europe and America
are not procreating at any level the equilibrium will be restored because we
will consume ourselves to extinction or irrelivance.

World poverty is only worse now because we see it on television. Do you
really think that poverty is worse now than in 1850? Or 950? Or 3000 BCE? No
we just are aware of it more.

-- No, this is nonsense. I live in a very mixed area of Brooklyn; there's
a lot of poverty/projects around and a lot of wealth, and access seems
pretty much universal. And as far as "justice" goes - your statement is an
insult to the very real grass-roots organizations here, whether dealing
with racism, over-development, jobs, or the war. And Brooklyn's hardly
atypical on this account.

The Poetics list is sterile in a lot of ways, but not this one.

All events and workshops listed here are held at the Paper Kite Press
and Wordpainting Studio in the Mary Stegmaier Mansion, 156 S. Franklin
Street, 2nd floor, Wilkes-Barre, PA 18702

8 a.m. Prompt and a Coffee
January 2nd =E2=80=93 January 12th @ 8 a.m.
$2 per session

Jennifer's in the studio writing, the coffee is brewing...come and
join her before work to get some writing exercise in and your first
(or third) cup of coffee for the day. A new writing prompt daily. Stay

Wordpainting =E2=80=93 Text and Image Studies
Monday nights @ 6:30 p.m.
Starting January 8th, $10 per session

In these workshops we'll study spatial forms of poetry through the use
of Tom Phillip's "A Humument" to create altered pages, collect
ephemera (we'll take walks when the weather is nicer!) to use in word
clusters, wheels and poetic forms, dig through the Dada movement, play
with calligrammes, explore storyboarding as a storytelling method,
look at the poem as a visual object--line breaks, indents, page
placement, and projective verse, write flash fictions prompted from a
swim through the magazine bin, and put poems on surfaces other than
pages! Each Monday will focus on a different topic and method for
exploring text and image. Attend one workshop or all of them as you
wish.

Third Friday Open Mic @ the Studio
Friday January 19th @ 7 p.m.

The long view can be comforting, if in a grim way. Shorter term,
globalization forces more and more in the less-industrialized
countries off the land and out of farming and into favelas or illegal
immigration. And billions suffer extreme poverty now whose great
grandchildren may live in a more universally prosperous China or
India, if environmental degradation doesn't become as catastrophic as
our direst predictions. Compassion is certainly an issue, but a
practical compassion--how to get from here to there with as little
extreme suffering on the part of whatever others as possible.

One might ask whether or not the writer of this statement is primarily
self-serving? I am not sure if HB wants us to applaud his wisdom, or,
personally, that I should feel free now to blow up my neighbors' houses for
the rumored gold and oil wealth under their foundations.
Parenthetically - under this view -  Bush and his cronies should only be
criticized for confusing 'democracy' as the aim in Iraq (so stupidly
utopian), and not just going direct to capture and assume entitlement to
that country's oil reserves. I would have gladly put my  12 sons in the
service of the Army if 'we' had only done that.

Yes, HB, I agree with Alan Sondheim that the gist of this statement is
nonsense. Thought I suspect on some odd level this appraisal is intended to
be 'well meaning', I read it as in an easily gained - if not gratuitous -
pessimism. "Disgusting" in a word: a life hating, toxic point of view that
is often used to quell impulses towards 'good works' with a much more
loving, compassionate yield.
Certainly nothing that I want to ingest as a way of going into the New Year.

I often find the reactions to reality on the Buffalo list interesting with
their refusal to accept what is true and to call facts nonsense.

I would never argue against "good works" or a struggle for justice on a
personal level, in fact in my own life I try my best to do both, but what is
amazing is that comfortable poets like to lament "injustice" when we are
part of the system and our actions cause more harm than good in so many
cases.

Please cut the bull about "I live in a marginal area" if you live in the
USA, Europe or Japan your national luxury is the result of millions of
others' poverty even if you are a well meaning liberal our system and
frankly ALL systems are based on exploitation you cannot escape it. Here is
a good example the next time a poet gets a Guggenheim fellowship he/she
should give it back because that money was raised by Solomon Guggenheim a
copper baron who used near slave labor in Chile to make his millions- yet
many poets who are 'liberals' accept these grants- we are all part of a
system.  The level of responsibilty is only a matter of degrees but we are
all responsible for what happens.

It is only when there are many with power that exploitation has been reduced
to tolerable levels. The problem is that we live in a monopoly world now and
this is resulting in more pain not less. But competition from new emerging
nations will end our monopoly before we know it and someone in China or
India will be pulling the strings

Jim,

Happy new year.

Do you mean a machine, if complex enough, will inevitably ask the question,
am I mortal, or what will happen after I cease to exist?

Do we know (or how do we know) that imagining its cessation is part of the
essence of being conscious"

"I exist because I may cease to exist." Or:
"I may not exist; therefore I am."

Ciao,

Murat

No. Most in-the-dark-all-cats-are-black / in-the-long-run-we're-all-dead
arguments may be dispelled with a little light. So here. This one is
actually  Hirschman's futility thesis, very lightly disguised. (Cf his *The
Rhetoric of Reaction*, published in the '90s.) Socio-economic systems do
actually differ one from another, whatever their similarities; and the US,
Europe and Japan do not actually form an homogenous socio-economic entity
or, for that matter three separate but related entities in any way that
would justify these sorts of statements.

Of course, another way of looking at the issue of globalisation might be to
google expressions such as 'peripheral capitalism' (the rich/poor divides
within wealthy societies and their causes have much in common with the
divides between wealthy societies and poor societies and some of the
rural/urban divides within both) and/or 'cognitive capitalism' (how Marx's
*general intellect* is exploited is a cause both of disempowerment within
powerful societies and of disempowerment by powerful societies of less
powerful societies).

Or one could always visit a slum.

I mean that if a being has consciousness of itself and he/she/it knows that
it will die sometime in the future, it would probably wonder what happens
then, yes.

I indicated earlier I don't see why such machines may one day exist. They
exist now, if you believe that we are, in a basic sense, machines, whatever
else we may also be.

We don't, do we. I said a conscious being that knows it will die.

Op-Ed Contributor: Ghosts in the Machine
By DEBORAH BLUM
When scientists wrote in a recent issue of the journal Nature that they could induce phantom effects — the sensation of being haunted by a shadowy figure — by stimulating the brain with electricity, it made perfect neurological sense.

I'm trying to track down a passage either from one of Oppen's daybooks / working papers / papers or from the letters.  The gist of it involves Oppen's observation that New York City is an example of a completely humanized landscape, and that this is not necessarily such a good thing.
  Anyone have any ideas?  Please backchannel if you are able to locate or have it handy.
  Many thanks!

Jim,

Of course, one (the human) may finally create a machine which will never die
(wear out), in other words, may create a god -a machine conscious of its
immortality.

There are two practical obstacles to this outcome, the first economic, and
the second psychological. Since inbuilt obsolescence is at the heart of
economic production, at least in capitalism, there is little incentive to
create such a machine. Also, what is the degree of human desire to create a
machine inherently superior to himself/herself?

On the other hand, imagine a scenario where the Pentagon builds perfect
human replicas -immuned to radioactivity, for instance- which can survive a
total nuclear war (or any other armageddon one can imagine, from global
boiling to super-sized meteors). We end up with mankind, through natural
selection, replaced by "androidus divino sapiensa" (pardon my Latin).
Rucker's "Freeware, etc" series is, if I remember correctly, about that.

Will the science books of androids say "androidi divino sapiensa are
descendents of homo americanus assholus"?

As important, if not more, will androids then have sex [with electric sheep]
to propagate themselves, or only for pleasure, or none at all?

To ruminate on one of David's wonderful riffs: will the androids be abliged
to create android drones to do manual labor and who/which are devoid of the
"virtue of immortality" in order to maintain ecological balance. One should
remember that only the original androids (the white descendants of HAA) are
created endowed with the inalienable right of immortality.

Ciao to all,

Murat

why would a machine not be subject to decay and death like the rest of us?
just a longer life, praps. it can 'die' from many causes. bit rot. bit rot
is when the thing doesn't work on new systems. or no more hardware
compatible with its own. assassination. suicide. apocalypse. epoceclipse.
epoxyblips.

a machine conscious of its own immortality would have somehow to not be
capable of dying. i'm not sure how that would work in this world. praps by
escaping the wheel altogether.

yes, well, more likely is a machine that does no thinking and only makes
money. you turn it on in the morning and go fishing. hell, why turn it off
at night?

i believe machines do actually already have sex. but just on saturdays and
by arrangement.

of course there are exceptions. james brown said he was a sex machine and i
think we have to believe him.

Jim, that's a very good point. Perhaps, therefore as I said, mortality (or
enthropy) is of the essence of consciousness.

Of course if one is going to die after three hundred years, for instance,
death may become a theoretical abstraction like heaven or hell.

I wrote a piece about twety-five years ago, called "Automic Piles,"in
reaction to Reagan;s winning the presidential election. It may be of
interest to you and relevant to the issues we are discussing.

The piece is in the poet Mustafa Ziyalan's website. You can read it there.
Here is its url: http://ziyalan.com/marmara/automic.html

Cralan Kelder asks:

What obligation does a poet have to an audience?



I suppose that depends on the poem: if narrative,

the obligation to tell enough of a story to register

as a story, rather than as a mere aggregation (see

Homer's catalogue of ships-a poetic triumph

over a list). If didactic, the obligation to present

a recognizable point. Conceiving the poem as

its own audience, the obligation to lend it one's

own ears, to listen for it like a signer for the deaf

& then, in gestures, translate it for itself. Clearly,

this question has a panoply of answers, & I hope

others will offer theirs. Thanks, Cralan, for asking.

out to react, as an artist, to that knowledge?

Given the thread earlier about the suspicion that most people who read
poetry are poets; when performing at least poets can reach a wider audience.

The question is,
What obligation does a poet have to an audience?

For any who are interested in website traffic numbers for
informational/comparative purposes, in 2006, the publishing empire of
logolalia.com produced these numbers:

KBytes Transferred
144,109,302 (that's 137 gigabytes to you and me, and this number is
skewed by the fact that I use it as a convenient way to transfer large
files)

Visits
341,422

Pages
825,129

Files 	
3,358,250

Hits
3,815,106

One other point of interest, the overwhelming majority of this traffic
comes from direct request--people who type the URL into their address
bar, click a link in a non-web-based email client, or whose browsers
are configured not to report referrer. The second biggest source is
search engines.

As one specific example, when a reportedly heavily trafficked blog
pointed to a series running at the abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz site it
generated 141 referrals. That same month saw 1424 referrals from
search engines into which individuals had entered the search string:
"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". The month before that was 1354.

Third biggest referrer would be an aggregate of all stumbledupon.com
traffic--individuals of which regularly refer into the thousands.

May 2007 be your best year, yet.

Regards,
Dan

David,

You know all cats are supposed to be descendants of cats in Ancient Egypt
-associated for me with gnostic  (liminal) essence. That was the question I
tried to bring up in reference to the Chinese room, the metaphysical (the
synthesis of analysis with values) partly leading to the liminal, in
addition to what is technologically or strictly analytically possible?

I have a review of "What He Ought To Know," Ed Foster's last poetry book,
which is coming out soon in The New Review. The second section of the revie=
w
begins with a series of quotations around cats. Here are a few of them:

"Cats, cats, oh cats. Cats toujours good. Dogs no good. Dogs have bad ways,
like people. Bad ways."
 (Sait Faik, "The Man Who Did Calisthenics")

"A Blind Cat Black"
(Ece Ayhan, book title)

"the darkling cat too needs the boy
his family locks the pantry."
(k. Iskender, "souljam")

"To know a cat's pleasure, one must put one's hand around the throat and
hear the "grrr." Move the hand over the smooth back, around the stiff
curvature of the tail, the glow of the tapering tip." MNN

The purpose of the review is to show in Foster's poetry, through the
circuitous route of gnosticism from Egypt to Byzantium/Istanbul to
Swedenberg, Emerson, Spicer,  a connection between Spicer's ideal poetics
and the Turkish language and poetry:

"    When Jack Spicer says he wants words to become the click of logs in th=
e
water, he is saying that he wants a poetry made of cadences. Cadences point
to the motion of the water language covers. When Spicer says his language i=
n
paradise would have an infinitely small vocabulary, he means a poetry where
meaning has turned into pure motion.

    Spicer is the creator of Gnostic language in the second half of the 20t=
h
century in English. Traditionally, this honor goes to Robert Duncan; but
they are very different. Duncan's poetry involves a thickening of, a belief
in language; the result, to this writer at least, is an excess of it. If on=
e
needs the click of words =96based on skepticism about the ability of words,=
 or
systems, to contain the full reality of human emotions- one goes to Spicer.
....

    At least in the West, the development of Gnosticism is circuitous. Ther=
e
is an assumption it starts in ancient Egypt. It is prevalent during
Hellenism, when the gap, the distance between a central authority and the
periphery widens, and one has to compensate for it spiritually, in the real=
m
of ideas. It then settles in Byzantium, Geographically (and politically),
Byzantium is a center in the middle of the periphery. This idea of
centrality in the peripheries (one in the many) becomes crucial later in
Gnosticism; Emerson, for instance, picks it up from Emanuel Swedenborg and,
dynamically, sees it as a process. Byzantium falls to the Islamic East in
1453. After the event, the continuity of Gnosticism in the West stops.
Instead of being passed on, Gnosticism becomes a coded message, actively,
almost accidentally, to be received.9 The relayers of these messages are
often obscure figures =96crackpots- relegated to the back rooms of librarie=
s,
usually come across as fragmented quotes in somebody else's books...
What He Ought To Know looks with one eye at Spicer and the other at
Istanbul, Turkey.
....
    Here lies one of the most resonant aspects of Foster's book for me. It
involves a historical act of magic. While with the Islamic conquest of
Byzantium (Constantinople) Gnosticism goes underground in the West, in the
form of Sufism, its mirror image exists in the East. What is more, Spicer's
paradisiacal language of cadences (clicking logs), with an infinitely small
vocabulary, is what spoken Turkish is. The Turkish grammar is completely
based on cadences. With a completely flexible syntax, words can be
permutated in any order to create endless nuances of meaning. Eda, the
essence of Turkish poetry, is a poetics of pure motion, clicking logs."

Happy new year.

Ciao,

Murat

Subject:      Calling Greek speakers/translators
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

For an annual symposium of Greek and Anglophone poets.

The Paros Symposium was founded by Susan Gevirtz and Siarita Kouka in 2004.
This year the symposium will be co-organized by Liana Sakelliou and myself.
We meet for 1 week on the island of Paros, translate each other's work,
discuss translation and cultural contexts, and give readings.

Space is limited, but we may have room for 1 or 2 more participants.

I'm looking for Anglophone poets who are fluent (or at least competent) in
Modern Greek and have an interest in translation and contemporary Greek lit.

If you're a poet who knows Greek, I'd love to hear from you. Please write me
backchannel, telling me a little about your work, and please attach your CV.

Thank you, kai kali chronia!

I believe in democracy. I believe in grassroots in their tiniest form. I
believe that without thousands of small supporters, there's no franchise.  I
refuse to operate a reading series by executive edict!

I'll put this before you one last time, as it ends at midnight:
http://observable.org/dollar/

I firmly believe that everybody has a dollar.

Cheers for a happy new year!

 to these and more in color if they are available.

Thanks.David Harrison Horton=20

Riverbend is back with two new accounts - after a long period of not posting
on her blog. Entirely chilling, but entirely worth it. The horror of what
Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld & Rice have created in Iraq is beyond measure. If there
is any vestige of justice left in 'our' justice system and Congress, these
folks ought to be up for immediate grabs.
May that be - as well - a New Year's wish & reality.

Other than all that, Happy New Year all!

Interviews with Poetry Editors on the Future of Poetry Publishing

http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/Interviews%20with%20Poetry%20Editors.htm

In light of the the New Statesman article by Neil Astley, 'Poetry For People', and the vigorous reactions that my blog  entry concerning it provoked at The Poem forum I thought it would be interesting to discuss some of the wider implications that Astley’s concerns in the article suggest, and how these relate to such matters as: poetry and publishing, and the future of poetry in printed form and on the Internet. To do this, I have gathered responses from the following editors to a set of questions regarding these issues.


Tim Allen
John M. Bennett
Jake Berry
Andrew Duncan
Ken Edwards
Tony Frazer
Susana Gardner
Geoffrey Gatza
Rupert Loydell
Alan May
Douglas Messerli
