UNITED STATES by Dan Featherston

Factory School. 2005. 72 pages, perfect bound, 6.5x9.

$12 / $10 direct order

About United States: These poems bear witness to various atrocities at
large and domestically, but also to the role that liberal Democratic
ideology plays in the atrocities of genocide and cultural imperialism.
Poets like Dan Featherston go a long way toward making the reader aware
of the artifice of politics and the poetics of ideology. In this way,
poets can be more than spectators. Featherston is certainly more than a
spectator. It is his lyric vision and the communitarian commitment of
his collection that reminds the reader that poetry is, in fact, a
public act.

About Heretical Texts: This series begins with, and intends to

appear in four volumes of five books each over the course of two years.

Dear List,

  I may be in Seattle around March 22-26 or 27, visiting my son. I know it's
short notice but I wonder if anyone could suggest a place I might read. Does
anyone have email contact info for Elliot Bay Books or Open Books, for
instance?  Backchannel please.

FANTASIES IN PERMEABLE STRUCTURES by Laura Elrick

Factory School. 2005. 72 pages, perfect bound, 6.5x9.

$12 / $10 direct order

About Fantasies in Permeable Structures: This book takes the idea that
history is not linear as its starting point. Can "outmoded" discursive
forms do more than appear as the junkyard backdrop for the imperatives
of capitalist cultural production? What speaks through what is already
there? If we can think of the present as the future of its past, is it
possible to re-spatialize the present from behind the bulwark of
postmodernist procedures?

The complete first volume of Heretical Texts is available for $40

1. Dan Featherston, United States
2. Laura Elrick, Fantasies in Permeable Structures
3. Linh Dinh, Borderless Bodies
4. Sarah Menefee, Human Star
5. kari edwards, obedience

About Heretical Texts: This series begins with, and intends to
investigate, the assumption that poetry is political. Inherent to the
Heretical Texts mission is a focused imagining of 'political poetry' as
a form of public intervention, invention, and invocation that calls on
(and up) language to call out a public, a people. Heretical Texts will
appear in four volumes of five books each over the course of two years.
Volume Two (spring 2006) will feature work by Steve Carll, Carol
Mirakove, Diane Ward, Brian Kim Stefans, and Kristin Prevallet.

The Greenwood Encyclopedia of American Poets and Poetry
*Five Volumes*

edited by
Jeffrey Gray , James McCorkle , Mary McAleer Balkun

The most comprehensive reference on American poetry ever assembled,
this enormous encyclopedia includes more than 900 alphabetically
arranged entries by roughly 350 scholars. This encyclopedia surpasses
existing works by considering the entire range of American poetry,
overviewing major and minor authors, and combining biographical and
critical entries with entries on a wide range of topics. Written for
students and general readers at a time when poetry is central to the
curriculum, the set covers material from the colonial era to the
present, devoting special attention to contemporary poets and their
works. Multicultural in scope, the encyclopedia provides entries on
numerous poets from diverse ethnic backgrounds. It also devotes
considerable attention to women poets and to poets just beginning to
establish their reputations. In addition, it relates American poetry
to its social, historical, political, and cultural contexts.

University and author of Mastery's End: Travel and Postwar American
Poetry. His articles and poetry have appeared in such journals as

JAMES McCORKLE is a poet and essayist. His previous books include The

The Poems of Charles Reznikoff: 1918-1975, ed. Seamus Cooney (Boston:
Black Sparrow/David Godine), 2005. Reprints the 2-vol 1989 Black
Sparrow edition, but the text is reset and repaginated, there are a
few corrections, the notes have been revised, there is a new
biographical chronology, and Reznikoff's short and key essay, "First,
there is the need" has been appended. Full review of this book at:
http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/blog

*
There are several new books of interest by and about Laura Riding:

Elizabeth Friedmann, A Mannered Grace: The Life of Laura (Riding)
Jackson (New York: Persea, 2005)

The Laura (Riding) Jackson Reader, ed. Elizabeth Friedmann, (New
York: Persea, 2005): a thoughtfully selected and substantial sampler
of the full range of the work, including the full text of The
Telling, & about 40 pages of the poems (I would have preferred to see more).

Laura (Riding) Jackson, Under the Mind's Watch: Concerning Issue / Of
Language, Literature, Life / Of Contemporary Bearing, ed. John Nolan
and Alan J. Clarke (Oxford & Bern: Peter Lang, 2005). A collection of
unpublished essays from the 60s and 70s, assembled by (Riding)
Jackson, the most substantial collection from this period apart from
Rational Meaning.

Laura Riding, Mindscapes: Poemas, Selected, translated into
Portuguese, and introduced by Rodrigo Garicia Lopes (Sao Paulo:
Editora Iluminuras, 2004). 150 pages of the poems in bilingual facing
pages, followed by a short section of commentary by Samuels,
Friedmann, Jacobs, Nolan, Rothenberg/Joris, Clark, Bernstein,
Billiterri/Friedlander.

whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter

OBITUARIES
Candy Barr, 70; 1950s Stripper and Stag Film Star Personified the Joy
and Danger of Sex
By Myrna Oliver
Times Staff Writer

January 3, 2006

Candy Barr, infamous 1950s stripper and stag film star once
romantically linked to mobster Mickey Cohen and associated with
Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby, has died. She was 70.

Barr died Friday of pneumonia in an Abilene, Texas, hospital. She had
lived quietly in her native south Texas for several years.

Born Juanita Dale Slusher in Edna, Texas, on July 6, 1935, Barr
forged a life exotic enough in the mid-20th century to inspire a
biopic. (One was contemplated but never produced in the late 1980s,
with Farrah Fawcett portraying Barr.)

Before the dancer's career was derailed in 1960 by a prison term for
marijuana, she was earning $2,000 a week in Los Angeles and Las Vegas
clubs.

It was Barr who trained actress Joan Collins for her role as an
exotic dancer in the 1960 movie "Seven Thieves," earning her a credit
as technical advisor.

"She taught me more about sensuality than I had learned in all my
years under contract," Collins wrote in her autobiography, "Past
Imperfect." Collins went on to describe Barr as "a down-to-earth girl
with an incredibly gorgeous body and an angelic face."

Barr became a landmark in the sexual liberation of Texas men in the
1950s, Gary Cartwright wrote in a 1976 Texas Monthly magazine
article, the same year the 41-year-old but still shapely Barr posed
nude for Oui men's magazine.

Cartwright wrote that in her early career, Barr had epitomized "the
conflict between sex as joy and sex as danger. The body was perfect,
but it was the innocence of the face that lured you on."

In 1984, Texas Monthly listed Barr among such luminaries as Lady Bird
Johnson as one of history's "perfect Texans."

"Of all the small-town bad girls," the magazine said, Barr "was the
baddest."

And Barr earned her place in the exhaustive 2004 volume published by
Oxford University, "Striptease: The Untold History of the Girlie
Show."

Barr said she began life as "poor white trash." After her mother died
when she was 9, she was ignored by her stepmother and sexually abused
by a neighbor and a baby-sitter.

She fled to Dallas at the age of 13, married a safecracker at 14 and
soon fell into exotic dancing and prostitution. Later claiming that
she was drugged and forced to perform, she was featured in a 1951
blue movie "Smart Alec."

She befriended Ruby, owner of Dallas' Carousel Club, who was
subsequently convicted of killing Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of
President Kennedy. Federal agents questioned Barr after Oswald's
killing, but she insisted she knew nothing about Ruby's involvement
in any conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination.

In the early 1950s, Barr got a job as cigarette girl at Barney
Weinstein's Theater Lounge in downtown Dallas. Impressed with her
startling beauty, Weinstein's brother, Abe, gave her her stage name,
had her bleach her hair and showcased her as a bump-and-grind
burlesque queen in his Colony Club.

Barr developed her trademark costume â€” 10-gallon hat, pasties,
"scanty panties," a pair of six-shooters and cowboy boots â€” and
quickly became a favorite with fraternity boys, Dallas crime figures,
businessmen and political leaders, who booked her for stag parties.

Conservative Dallas residents, however, were less impressed and began
pressuring police and prosecutors to shut down Barr's act.

In 1957, she was arrested for having less than four-fifths of an
ounce of marijuana concealed in her bra. She maintained that she was
framed by police and was only holding the drug for a friend.

"We think we can convince a jury that a woman with her reputation, a
woman who has done the things she has done, should go to prison,"
Assistant Dallas County Dist. Atty. Bill Alexander told the Dallas
Morning News after Barr's arrest.

"She may be cute," Alexander, who would prosecute Ruby six years
later, told the jury in his closing argument, "but under the
evidence, she's soiled and dirty."

Barr was convicted and, under tough state laws for what would now be
a misdemeanor, was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

The trial garnered national publicity and only enhanced her fame. The
judge even asked to be photographed with her in his chambers.

Awaiting appeal, Barr was hired to perform in Las Vegas' El Rancho
Vegas Hotel and Los Angeles' Club Largo on Sunset Boulevard, drawing
$2,000 fees.

It was during this period that Barr met and dated Cohen for two
months. They publicly said they were engaged, and he crisscrossed the
country with her, consulting lawyers in the appeal of her sentence.

But neither the romance nor the appeal could go on forever.

"It's all over," the dapper ex-bookie told The Times in May 1959.
"We're just two different kinds of people. No, we didn't have no
fight. It was more like what you might call a discussion."

Two years later, Barr revealed Cohen's answer to her drug sentence
when she was returned to Los Angeles to testify against him in his
trial for income tax invasion, in which he was convicted and
sentenced to 11 years in prison.

Barr testified that although Cohen paid her lawyers $15,000, he also
gave her cash and phony identification documents, had her dye her
hair and flee to Mexico. She said she got bored and returned to the
U.S. shortly before her appeal was denied.

"I always wanted a brick house of my own, and it looks like I am
going to have one," Barr told an assembled crowd and news media when
she finally walked into Goree Farm for Women in Huntsville, Texas, in
December 1959.

Then-Texas Gov. John B. Connally paroled her in 1963 and pardoned her
four years later.

During her imprisonment, she took high school courses, worked as a
seamstress, sang in the prison choir and played in its band.

Barr also wrote a book of poetry, which she published in 1972, titled
"A Gentle Mind â€¦ Confused." Its title poem stated:

Hate the world that strikes you down,

A warped lesson quickly learned,

Rebellion, a universal sound,

Nobody cares â€¦ No one's concerned.

Fatigued by unyielding strife

Self-pity consoles the abused,

And the bludgeoning of daily life

Leaves a gentle mind â€¦ confused."

Barr was arrested a second time for possession of marijuana in a 1969
raid on her home, but charges were dropped for lack of evidence.

She tried briefly to restart her career as a dancer in 1967 at the
age of 32, again at Hollywood's Largo club, performing before a
backdrop of prison bars.

"Time has been kind to Miss Barr. The onetime fiancee of Mickey Cohen
is in good, if slightly gaunt, form and is still an energetic
dancer," wrote Times critic Kevin Thomas. "From the audience, she
seems a young woman with an aura of sadness and sorrow who is doing
the thing she knows best."

Barr largely retired to a reclusive life in Texas, surrounded by her
pets.

"Let the world find someone else to talk about," she told Texas
Monthly in 2001. "I like being left alone."

Barr married and divorced four husbands. She had a daughter and
became a grandmother, but information on survivors was not
immediately available.

  eat the telling of it cold
   in the places we grew up
  the impotent trees the frightened hard

  big arched rust and all fucked-up

<i>The Salt Daughter</i>, poetry by Christine Hamm

Rebecca Loudon has this to say about the book:

<i>The Salt Daughter</i> takes us on a journey through the secret kitchen of an American
family. This daughter is no shrinking violet. Like Alice in the well, she swims through
spoilt milk, soup, wine, rotten eggs and ice cream. She is the dark bud on a head of
cabbage, the burnt patch in the pot of soup, the cotton candy under the nails of a
fighter. In turning back to see mother, father and siblings, <i>The Salt Daughter </i>is
sea water and chloride, cathartic and acid. Hamm's brilliant collection resounds with the
force of a fairy tale.

Yeah, I second the Friedmann bio
         (I wrote a review of it in a Poetry project newsletter last year)

The Riding reader is probably not a bad place to start for those who can't
find the many out of print texts....

And thanks for letting me know about the "Mind's Watch"---didn't realize it
was out.

though when I read the phrase, 'the most substantial collection from this
period apart from Rational meaning," I still feel The Telling gets slighted

-------

Mark Booth is a visual artist, sound artist, and writer based in
Chicago. His work has been seen, read, and heard in Performance
Research, ACM, Jubilat, antennae, Whitewalls, infrathin, In The Eye of
the Ear Sound Festival, The Outer Ear Sound Festival, the Immeasurable
Distance Series, Performing Arts Chicago, Discrete Series, and
Künstlerhaus Mousonturm (with Tim Etchells and Matthew Goulish as the
Institute of Failure). A recent solo exhibition of paintings, drawings,
and audio works, Panda Bear Insemination Team Picnic and Other Thought
Formations, appeared at the Bodybuilder and Sportsman Gallery, Chicago
in June 2005.

Laura Elrick's book Fantasies in Permeable Structures is forthcoming
from Factory School in 2005 as part of the Heretical Texts series. She
is also the author of sKincerity (Krupskaya, 2003) and is one of the
featured writers on Women In the Avant Garde, an audio CD produced by
Narrow House Recordings in 2004. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.

Andrew Levy is the author of several books of poetry, including Ashoka
(Zasterle Books), Paper Head Last Lyrics (Roof Books), Curve (O Books)
and Curve 2 (Potes & Poets Press), and Democracy Assemblages (Innerer
Klang). He is editor, with Roberto Harrison, of the arts and poetry
journal Crayon.

Jesse Seldess recently relocated from Chicago to Berlin. While in
Chicago, he co-curated the Discrete Reading and Performance Series with
Kerri Sonnenberg. From Berlin, he continues to edit Antennae, a journal
of experimental writing, music, and performance. Chapbooks of his poems
have been published by Answer Tag Home Press, Bronze Skull Press, and
the Chicago Poetry Project. His first full-length book of poems, Who
Opens, is forthcoming from Kenning Editions
<http://www.durationpress.com/kenning>.

Jeff Snyder (b.1978) is a composer, electronics performer, and sound
artist working in New York City. His works, which characteristically
employ combinations of acoustic, electric, and electronic instruments,
have been performed by a variety of ensembles. In addition to his
concert works, he has frequently collaborated with artists from other
mediums, including choreographers, visual artists, and video artists.
Jeff received his undergraduate degree from the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, where he studied with Stephen Dembski and Joel
Naumann. As a current doctoral candidate at Columbia University, Jeff
continues his compositional studies under the direction of Fred Lerdahl
and Joseph Dubiel. Recently, he has joined the Wet Ink composers'
collective, presenting concerts of new music in the New York area. When
not composing concert music or designing sound installations, Jeff can
be seen performing as one-half of the Disembodied Head of Peter
Ladefoged and one-third of the experimental electronic trio Jesus
Crisco. In addition to his own electronic works, Jeff enjoys remixing
other artists and has produced remixes for artists ranging from Public
Enemy (working with collaborator Ryan Smith) to TV Pow.

Rodrigo Toscano was a 2005 Fellow in Poetry from the New York Foundation
for the Arts. He is the author of To Leveling Swerve (Krupskaya Books,
2004), Platform (Atelos, 2003), The Disparities (Green Integer, 2002)
and Partisans (O Books, 1999). Originally from California, Toscano has
been living in NYC for the last seven years.

Hannah Weiner (1928-1997) was an influential poet and performance artist
of the generation of the New American Poetry. Best known for her
Clairvoyant Journal
<http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/speccoll/m504/index.html>project, recently
published in full by the UCSD Archive for New Poetry, Weiner's unique
"clair-style" writing helped make her a crucial bridge between New York
School and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry, as well as demonstrating the lasting
influence of the 1960s NYC avant-garde upon contemporary American
poetics generally. Interest in her work has only grown in recent years,
with unpublished works such as PAGE and Country Girl appearing in print,
as well as reiterations of the tri-vocal performance methods instigated
by the widely circulated audio recordings of her Clairvoyant Journal
texts. Hannah Weiner's Open House, a selection of mostly unpublished
works from the Weiner Archive, is forthcoming from Kenning Editions. The
book serves to demonstrate the wider range of Weiner's achievement over
decades of creative engagement with several forms of poetry and
performance.

Jeremy Woodruff (1973, Brooklyn, NY) grew up and was educated in Boston
before he traveled to London to study with Michael Finnissy at the Royal
Academy of Music. He then undertook a study of South Indian music and
completed a diploma in Non-Western music at the Conservatorium von
Amsterdam. He now lives in Berlin with his wife and son. His most recent
commissions were by the Kammerensemble Neue Musik Berlin and by
Ensemberlino Vocale and Martin Krouse, percussionist.

The Telling is what thoroughly separates Riding from being only a historical footnote. It also makes clear why comparisons to G. Stein are inept attempts to bring Riding an audience in through the side door of pseudo-similiarity by using writing that can be understood thru contextualization, or through the inferred (intended or not) comparison of "here is the closest female writer" rather than on the strength of her prose. As long as writers stress the modernist importance of The Telling as equal with say Zukovsky's "A" or Olson's oveure, it will survive. With _Lives of Wives_ and _Anarchism is not Enough_ still in print it would seem a reprint of The Telling would be near. After that, and what is of more concern to me, Chris & Charles, is the loss of the wealth of material in various issues of Chelsea, like the only interview she ever gave, or About Story. Has anyone, or is anyone planning to extensively revive, reprint or work with the Chelsea issues?

He was a big influence on many poets in Canada with his unapologetic
theatricality and song of himself, the little guy, and the big idea.

I met him once. Around 1986. I'd arranged for him to be interviewed by Susan
Musgrave when he was in Victoria. He was first into the radio studio and I
was doing the tech for the interview.

"What's there to do in this town?" he asked, "It seems kind of dead."

He was from Montréal. Definitely fun central in Canada.

"Yeah, it is. You have to make your own fun here," I replied.

"It's a good thing to be able to make your own fun wherever you go," he
said.

*

Thinking of his poetry, I remember his judgement in one poem of a female who
professed to love poetry but would not sleep with him. "Her devotion to
literature was incomplete."

He enjoyed getting into trouble. I think he made his own fun wherever he
went.

He was a big influence on Leonard Cohen. You can hear it when Cohen says "I
taught him how to dress, he taught me how to live forever."

He will by now be stirring the abstract entities to a deeper gaze on matters
earthly. So long, Irving. He was large. He dreamed big. He was dissatisfied.
A wonderful poet, Irving Layton.

has been updated with 7 pieces by Karl Kempton.

If you imagine that there is a difference between writing some poems
and living a life of poetry, a poetry of life, and if you feel it's
something you might aspire to, yourself, if you only had an example,
come look, come see, come learn.

Subject:      Riding (Jackson) & Stein
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

*The Telling* (30pp.) is included in the *The Laura (Riding) Jackson
Reader*. That work remains of great importance to me too. I don't
know about any other plans for other (Riding) Jackson publications.
Despite her early connection to (and friendship with) Stein, Riding
rightly viewed her work in sharp contrast to Stein's. In some ways it
is one of the clearly demarcation of the difference of what I call
first- and second-wave modernism; Riding is certainly one of the most
striking poets of the second-wave (as indeed are Reznikoff, Zukofsky,
and Riding's friend Hart Crane, etc.). Riding (Jackson) first
discusses Stein, quite brilliantly, in *Contemporaries and Other
Snobs* (1928). Later in her life her comments become more reductive
and bitter. One particularly unpleasant example, "The Word Play of
Gertrude Stein,"  is in the new collection of later writings, *Under
the Mind's Watch,* where (Riding) Jackson says that  Stein's writings
"were early products of a pathological condition." Nonetheless, as
with all of (Riding) Jackson's work, her "witness for the
prosecution" approach is incisive in its delineation of certain
philosophical and aesthetic (you might even say theological) fault
lines for modernist (and contemporary) poetry.

Mark Booth is a visual artist, sound artist, and writer based in =
Chicago.
His work has been seen, read, and heard in Performance Research, ACM,
Jubilat, antennae, Whitewalls, infrathin, In The Eye of the Ear Sound
Festival, The Outer Ear Sound Festival, the Immeasurable Distance =
Series,
Performing Arts Chicago, Discrete Series, and K=FCnstlerhaus Mousonturm =
(with
Tim Etchells and Matthew Goulish as the Institute of Failure). A recent =
solo
exhibition of paintings, drawings, and audio works, Panda Bear =
Insemination
Team Picnic and Other Thought Formations, appeared at the Bodybuilder =
and
Sportsman Gallery, Chicago in June 2005.

Laura Elrick's book Fantasies in Permeable Structures is forthcoming =
from
Factory School in 2005 as part of the Heretical Texts series. She is =
also
the author of sKincerity (Krupskaya, 2003) and is one of the featured
writers on Women In the Avant Garde, an audio CD produced by Narrow =
House
Recordings in 2004. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.

Andrew Levy is the author of several books of poetry, including Ashoka
(Zasterle Books), Paper Head Last Lyrics (Roof Books), Curve (O Books) =
and
Curve 2 (Potes & Poets Press), and Democracy Assemblages (Innerer =
Klang). He
is editor, with Roberto Harrison, of the arts and poetry journal Crayon.

Jesse Seldess recently relocated from Chicago to Berlin. While in =
Chicago,
he co-curated the Discrete Reading and Performance Series with Kerri
Sonnenberg. From Berlin, he continues to edit Antennae, a journal of
experimental writing, music, and performance. Chapbooks of his poems =
have
been published by Answer Tag Home Press, Bronze Skull Press, and the =
Chicago
Poetry Project. His first full-length book of poems, Who Opens, is
forthcoming from Kenning Editions =
<http://www.durationpress.com/kenning>.

Jeff Snyder (b.1978) is a composer, electronics performer, and sound =
artist
working in New York City. His works, which characteristically employ
combinations of acoustic, electric, and electronic instruments, have =
been
performed by a variety of ensembles. In addition to his concert works, =
he
has frequently collaborated with artists from other mediums, including
choreographers, visual artists, and video artists.=20
Jeff received his undergraduate degree from the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, where he studied with Stephen Dembski and Joel =
Naumann.
As a current doctoral candidate at Columbia University, Jeff continues =
his
compositional studies under the direction of Fred Lerdahl and Joseph =
Dubiel.
Recently, he has joined the Wet Ink composers'=20
collective, presenting concerts of new music in the New York area. When =
not
composing concert music or designing sound installations, Jeff can be =
seen
performing as one-half of the Disembodied Head of Peter Ladefoged and
one-third of the experimental electronic trio Jesus Crisco. In addition =
to
his own electronic works, Jeff enjoys remixing other artists and has
produced remixes for artists ranging from Public Enemy (working with
collaborator Ryan Smith) to TV Pow.

Rodrigo Toscano was a 2005 Fellow in Poetry from the New York Foundation =
for
the Arts. He is the author of To Leveling Swerve (Krupskaya Books, =
2004),
Platform (Atelos, 2003), The Disparities (Green Integer, 2002) and =
Partisans
(O Books, 1999). Originally from California, Toscano has been living in =
NYC
for the last seven years.

Hannah Weiner (1928-1997) was an influential poet and performance artist =
of
the generation of the New American Poetry. Best known for her =
Clairvoyant
Journal <http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/speccoll/m504/index.html>project, =
recently
published in full by the UCSD Archive for New Poetry, Weiner's unique
"clair-style" writing helped make her a crucial bridge between New York
School and L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE poetry, as well as =
demonstrating the lasting
influence of the 1960s NYC avant-garde upon contemporary American =
poetics
generally. Interest in her work has only grown in recent years, with
unpublished works such as PAGE and Country Girl appearing in print, as =
well
as reiterations of the tri-vocal performance methods instigated by the
widely circulated audio recordings of her Clairvoyant Journal texts. =
Hannah
Weiner's Open House, a selection of mostly unpublished works from the =
Weiner
Archive, is forthcoming from Kenning Editions. The book serves to
demonstrate the wider range of Weiner's achievement over decades of =
creative
engagement with several forms of poetry and performance.

Jeremy Woodruff (1973, Brooklyn, NY) grew up and was educated in Boston
before he traveled to London to study with Michael Finnissy at the Royal
Academy of Music. He then undertook a study of South Indian music and
completed a diploma in Non-Western music at the Conservatorium von
Amsterdam. He now lives in Berlin with his wife and son. His most recent
commissions were by the Kammerensemble Neue Musik Berlin and by =
Ensemberlino
Vocale and Martin Krouse, percussionist.

one of the funnest, funnest pieces of prose written in the early 20th
century is riding's introduction to her collection "progress of
stories."  bear with the first few pages, as the piece is purposely
slow to gather its real stream.  then it begins to disintegrate into
this fabulous fury at the people who, not understanding her writing,
have insulted her by calling her obscure.  hilarious.

About Heretical Texts: This series begins with, and intends to
investigate, the assumption that poetry is political. Inherent to the
Heretical Texts mission is a focused imagining of 'political poetry' as
a form of public intervention, invention, and invocation that calls on
(and up) language to call out a public, a people. Heretical Texts will
appear in four volumes of five books each over the course of two years.
Volume Two (spring 2006) will feature work by Steve Carll, Carol
Mirakove, Diane Ward, Brian Kim Stefans, and Kristin Prevallet.

Subject:      Re: Riding (Jackson) & Stein
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

There's an interesting account of the break between these two writers
in A MANNERED GRACE, a break in the friendship (over a misunderstanding
and implicit charges of anti-semitism) as well as over different approaches
to language and writing.

That Riding was drawn in the mid-twenties (and in her mid twenties) to
Stein, 26 years older than her, especially the Stein of "C as E", is
probably no more relevant to Riding, and (Riding) Jackson's own writing,
than her strategic employment of e.e.cummings against such snob modernists
as Eliot, Pound, etc. around that time. At best they could provide points
of entry for a reader---since Stein, nowadays at least is far more accepted
than Riding and (Riding) Jackson. But, in defense of the "reductive and
bitter" later comments on Stein, for me part of the point is to challenge
a mode of talking about literature that OVERPLAYS that relationship, and
literary "affiliations"---like people saying "oh Stein rescued Riding from
the stuffy Fugitives" (or anthologists "representing" Riding by "Elegy in
a Spider's Web," because it seems most "Stein-like"). From the 1920s up
until her death in 1991, (Riding) Jackson took on various sacred cows of
various and/or successive literary (among other) establishments, not simply
the names or "figures" but also of modes of reading them that have become
entrenched. One of these is to stress superficial, or seeming similarities,
stylistically. Since both detractors and supporters of Stein had come to
stress such similarities with Riding, it became important for (Riding)
Jackson,
in the service of clarity, and of dialogue (how many "literary" writers have
taken
the care to respond so in depth and intimately to her detractors as she?--
and then be called a "bitch" for it to boot?), to stress the differences.
I think many such comments have to be read in light of (Riding) Jackson's
larger challenge to literature, rather than in terms of equally reductive
side-takings in a courtroom drama.

One doesn't necessarily have to agree that Stein's writings are being
SINGLED OUT as especially "products of a pathological condition," to
consider from what perspective that would be true, and what, if any,
could be an alternative....

What is meant by "witness for the prosecution" in Charles' paragraph?
Who is prosecuting whom? What is prosecuting what?
And as a courtroom materializes, one could wonders about
defendants, juries and judges, and the role playing involved...

For (Riding) Jackson, after 1938, the "crime" would be poetry, or
poetic artifice, including her own. There is not greater Prosecutor.

friends --

collaborating with the German-based, American-born
blogger known as Indeterminancy, I've lately begun
presenting fresh renditions from the notable & obscure
German poet Kurt Tucholsky (1890-1935).  We're just at
the beginning of this exploration-in-translation,
blogging as we go.  My rendering of the 2nd poem
approached -- "Eyes in the Big City" -- is seen here:

http://kirwani.blogspot.com/2006/01/eyes-in-big-city-translation.html

 -- and that blog-page has a link to the first poem we did
(Tucholsky's "Mona Lisa's Smile").

Indeterminacy has also launched a new blog for this project, here:
http://kurttucholsky.blogspot.com/

I should be grateful for any Comment responses (on either of
those websites).

danke & thx,
d.i.

Subject: 	Gulf Coast Poets?

From: 	Armando Ibanez <pluma@earthlink.net>


Currently, I'm working on a documentary about the aftermath of
Hurricane Katrina.  Of course, it's about the event but it's an in
depth look at the people who either suffered at the hands of the
Hurricane or the volunteers.  I'm looking for poets that were impacted
by the storm in someway.  Do you know of any?  I've already interviewed
some poets but am looking for more.

If necessary, I can send you more detailed information about the
project..  Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.  Feel
free to send these email to your email list.

Blessings,

Mando

P.S. I just read a really neat line -- an adage:  "You've got to go out
on a limb; there's where the fruit grows."

        Love does not lie to you
  when war falls over your face
   like a troubled shaw--interests
  accrue unseen, and when you think
   about those small riddled warmths before
  waking, next to Mary--walked all over
   this place where the soil no longer
  speaks--sang truth shut in, sang truth
   to everything that doesn't deserve
  her touch--my voice still drying

Thanks Charles for writing back

After 1938, the "crime," however, would not behaving devoted much of say
1922-1938 to the writing of poetry, including her own--
(and in my opinion, there's more there than in many who devote their entire
writing life almost exclusively to poetry or verse; it's not like the
"renunciation" truly invalidated those accomplishments in an absolute way
for her, yet quite a few take the fact of that as an excuse to limit and
devalue a "body of work" (in what could be recognized as "poetry"
even)---sorry for that awkward term--at least as significant as any in the
20th century (for instance).

The "crime" (on perhaps a broader level) could also be ELECTRICITY which
she, in a sense, renounced
around the same time as she stopped writing "poetry" (the two actions are
very related, but the electricity is not talked about so much, at least in
"poetry circles")

For me at least, despite the so called "official" versions, much of the
writing that (Riding) Jackson did
since 1938 I turn to for many of the same reasons I turn(ed) to what's
called poetry----the feeling and thinking, and it doesn't lack "artifice"
though there's a sense of liberation along with rigor. And before 1938, the
generic status of "poetry" or what is, and/or should be, called that--is
written about variously

For those who are not willing to let go of the term poetry as the ultimate
writerly good, (Riding) Jackson offers ways to redefine it throughout---to
in a sense save it from what it has, institutionally, become. And this is as
evident in the writing she, and others, call poetry as much
as it is in her writing (both before and after 1938) that is NOT called
that...

(much more to say, to write...)

Lowell, Mass.--The Contemporary Reading Series held its fifth event on 1/5. Polish Literature: Tradition and Experimentation, developed in conjunction with the city's monthly Destination World festival, featured poet and translator Benjamin Paloff, translator of Dorota Maslowska's SNOW WHITE AND RUSSIAN RED (Grove Press, 2005); Verse Press author and Harvard University Briggs-Copeland Lecturer Peter Richards; Mass. Cultural Council Poetry Fellow Tanya Larkin; Jean Monahan, author of three books, including the recent MAULED ILLUSIONIST (Orchises Press, 2005); Gigi Thibodeau, professor at UMass-Lowell; and Patrick Pierce, a Lowell sculptor. Turnout for the event held at the National Park Service Visitor center was high, including several from Lowell's Polish enclave, and many of the new generation of artists who are moving to Lowell for its affordable housing in acres of once abandoned, now rehabbed factory building along the banks of the Merrimack River, and the seven canals t
hat flow through town.

A new website with more information on the reading series is now up

Information and pictures from the 9/30 event, featuring Sabrina Orah Mark, is available in the Revolving Museum's November Newsletter

CUE is published independently twice a year (in the winter and the summer).
The editors welcome submissions year-round, but we do not accept work via
e-mail. Mail four or more "prose poems" at a time. A cover letter citing
publications and awards, if any, is helpful, but please keep it concise.

Although we're reluctant to publish the absurdist / parable / fable
aesthetic, we will consider anything so long as the work is compelling. Work
considered experimental is strongly encouraged.

Unsolicited book reviews, translations, and criticism are also considered.
The editors are always looking to review new books, so if you have a book
you would like us to consider for review, please send it to the above
address. That said, we make no promises as to its review or inclusion in a
future issue.

All manuscripts and correspondence regarding submissions should be
accompanied by a self-addressed, stamped envelope (S.A.S.E.) for a response;
no replies will be given by e-mail.  The editors make their decisions on a
rolling basis, so expect about one month for a decision.

We continue to receive well over three hundred unsolicited manuscripts a
month, so if we take a bit longer than one month, please be patient. Do not
query us until two months have passed, and if you do, please email us, being
sure to indicate the postmark date of submission.

Simultaneous submissions are amenable as long as they are indicated as such
and we are notified immediately upon acceptance elsewhere. We do not reprint
previously published work. Payment is two copies upon publication.

    ...I oppose an international poetry festival in a city in which the
Arab inhabitants are oppressed systematically and cruelly, imprisoned
between walls, deprived of their rights and living spaces, humiliated in

Note: Aharon Shabtai is an Israeli poet and teaching Hebrew literature

He is also the husband of the courageous Prof. Tanya Reinhart who has
written extensively on the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. Many of her
articles can be found online by typing her name into google.

Both are to be applauded for their noble stance against the occupation
and the daily abd routine injustices committed against the Palestinian
people at the hands of their zionist occupiers.

To Yitzhak Eizenberg Shalom
Fifth international poetry festival in Jerusalem

Thank you for your invitation to participate in the international poetry
festival in Jerusalem in 2006 and the details.

I would like to take my name out of the list of participants. I read
these days on the barbarism in the Qalandia checkpoint. I oppose an
international poetry festival in a city in which the Arab inhabitants
are oppressed systematically and cruelly, imprisoned between walls,
deprived of their rights and living spaces, humiliated in checkpoints
and the international laws are violated. I think that even poets were
not allowed in the past, and not in the present, to ignore persecutions
and discriminations on a racial or national basis.

To crush out those "sinking feelings" I hear that Poetry In The Schools
programs across the country are encouraging poet-teachers to use their
Poetry Mag gift subscriptions for "collage exercises". The kids and poets
cut up pages from the magazine into all kinds of shapes, then paste them
down on to copies of Life, Time, Newsweek, and Vanity Fair. In the process
studernts are encouraged to mix words into new lines and juxtapose them with
pictures of world events, entertainment stars, etc., etc.
Though these poetry exercises have not been reported at all  in the media,
the classes are apparently very popular. Students previously reported as
depressed leave the classroom in a joyous mood, frequently taking digital
photographs with their cell phones and reciting the new poems aloud to
friends all over town.

Maxine, I hope this news comes as some relief!

"spreading poetry" as contagion, perhaps epidemic or even pandemic.  Then of
course, it's to be eradicated.

An aesthetic definition cannot define the hunger.

A new print magazine, Cannibal, seeks work for a first
issue, due out in April. Small run, handmade, and New
York City based, Cannibal wants ferocious poems,
literary essays, and criticism that survive by their
own instincts. We hope to have a fine collection of
poets known, little known, and unknown, all exhibiting
the kind of work that makes us hungrier for more.

There is such a huge difference between "The Telling" (30 pg) which has high importance to me and _The Telling_ which is indispensible and a few hundred pages plus depending on whether it's the US or British version. Each chapter delves into a re-telling of the telling in a way Stein or Taggart would be envyable of. And I hate to seem all academic and McGannish but the setting in The Reader seriously influences the interpretation of "The Telling." I also have seen various areas where _The Telling_ seems influential, like the poem "The Circus" by Koch and its companion piece that explains the writing of "The Circus." I always meant to ask him if Riding was the actual connection and this was his send off of it but never remembered to and it is a bit late now like that O'Hara poem from Meditations in an Emergency that someone stole my copy of & I will not search for in the collected because it is probably called poem.

I would argue this is just another by-product of the
sorry state of affairs in poetry, where we celebrate a
kind of almost fawning diversity and too many
disparate communities and the consequent dribble one
develops in any incestuous situation lingering deeply
in leanings, policed and parochial thought. This is
democracy, "THREE CHEERS FOR DEMOCRACY" -- and you
made it, the hubbub absent of any real discord,
discourse, dangerous undermining the established by
thoughtful thinkers, where there are no movements and
we just ring-a-ding our bells, because we like to --
and cause our ID says poet. Hell, the end result is
that we'll all be able to bathe in effluent as
interesting as, say, us. C'mon babes, surf the net and

mostly, quality. Mafia MFA's in creative writing? Rock
star poet MCs. Hosts who hoist there white flags in
form of radical undies. Poets who write computer noise
-- as if poetry, me thought, was about peopled
humanity. Succession! But that makes people unhappy! I

Hey everybody, check it out, finally a pod cast worth listening to,
with me on it!

http://www.kqed.org/topics/arts/writersblock/0601-killian.jsp


On this tape I read aloud the words of my late friend, Sam
D'Allesandro, whose collected stories I have edited eighteen years
after his death!  Unbelievable how time goes by so fast, and thinking
of him, Sam, so young when he died, only 31, he would be nearly 50
today.  Anyhow this is one of his best stories and a local public
radio station had me come in, read it, and they said they would make
it available for anyone to listen to.  Hopefully you will like what
you here and then go and take a look at his book, which I have
called, THE WILD CREATURES. which you can find, well at SPD, or
Amazon, or wherever.  It's a steal.  He was the greatest.  Well, if
not the greatest, he was anyhow insanely cute.  And a terrific
writer, as you will see.

Thanks

Kevin K.

Yes, I agree. And it sounds like Poetry Magazine's strategy is pretty
bizarre. They get $175 million and they come up with a strategy that
convoluted? They were bequeathed that huge sum three years ago and this is
what you get...

I just read an interview with John Barr, the Poetry Foundation's president,
and the only concrete educational initiative I found was that the Poetry
Foundation plans on having "recitation contests in all fifty states" by
spring of this year. How innovative is that. See
http://fdncenter.org/pnd/specialissues/content.jhtml?id=118500004.

This recitation contest is quite a load as far as I am concerned - why
not spend the money on teaching kids to write and perform their own work
instead of memorizing dusty dead white men's canon fodder?

One might also argue that money might be used to teach poetry in more schools
and even, gasp!!, universities, where a majority of people first read poetry.
If you imagine that university professors and teachers are at fault for making
poetry difficult or inscrutable or less popular than you imagine it should be,
I ask you to search your memory for a time when a teacher actually taught you
something, even about poetry, maybe?  I would guess that most people who think
well of poetry haven't been poisoned by teachers or become victims of the
conspiracy that keeps poetry from "the people."  And if you imagine that
POETRY magazine and its minions are going to to do more good than the
thousands of well-intentioned and even excellent teachers in the world and
programs already in existence like Poetry in the Schools, Teachers and Writers
Collective, just to name a few, you're probably wrong. WHile I've heard many
people in life who aren't even poets praising their teachers, I have yet to
hear many people say that their experience reading Poetry: A Magazine of
Verse, has changed their lives. One might also ask why big money and
conservative power want to work in the poetry field. I'm not that fond of
missionaries, for instance, for the good work they do in the field.  I trust
them less than teachers.

Poetry is art and should be prophetic and challenging. There is much poetry
that is good and great in the US but there is a sea of crap too- it has
always been that way since Dante, Since whoever wrote the Psalms.

POETRY Magazine is a cyst on the neck of Poetry the artform.
Here we are in Chicago with a large and interesting poetry scene, small
presses that are funded mostly from people's bank accounts and struggle to
survive and we have in our midst POETRY magazine with its millions.
POETRYdoes nothing for our community or Poetry in city that it calls home in
fact I have NEVER seen Christian Wiman at ANY poetry event in this city
except AWP two years ago.

I am sorry but POETRY Magazine makes me sick they spent millions on a study
to find out why people don't read poetry when they could have given that
money to 30 small press or reading series or MFA programs and really made an
impact. They got new offices in a LSD high rise when they could have opened
a Literary Center in Chicago which we desperately need and with all their
money they charge $12.00 to go to their readings.

And Ruth Lilly, at long last, through the most diabolical of means,
wreaks a measure revenge most rejected poets only ever dream about.

I can hear her laughing now: ahaha, that'll teach you to reject Ruth
Lilly!

Subject:      in search of courage in DC
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

On the morning of January 8th Tim Russert hosted an interview/debate with
Kate Michelman and Kate O'Beirne, a program he was calling The Battle of the
Kates.


Kate Michelman is the former president of NARAL, and the author of With
Liberty and Justice for All.  Kate O'Beirne is the Washington editor of The
National Review, and the author of Women Who Make the World Worse.

To be honest O'Beirne said nothing new, nothing not already said over and
over and over again by Bush, by Jerry Falwell, etc.

Kate Michelman however said some pretty fantastic things, one thing in
particular that I really wish Howard Dean, John Kerry and Hillary Clinton (all  of
whom are turning coat very quickly on gay rights and Roe v. Wade) could hear.
She's a brilliant woman, who calls for nothing less than for the Democrats to
 find the courage to stand their ground. Here's a small excerpt of what I'm
referring to:

Tim Russert: ...Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic Party said this
recently: "I think we need to talk about abortion differently. ... Republicans
 have forced us into a corner to defend abortion." Then he went on to say:
"If I  could strike the words 'choice' and 'abortion' out of the lexicon of our
party,  I would."

Kate Michelman: ...I'm reminded of the '92 election when President Clinton
was elected. The House and the Senate were under control of Democrats. The
political pundits were writing the obituary of the right wing and the
conservative movement, and you didn't see the conservatives sort of back away  from
their values or their principles. They didn't give up and start publicly  talking
about changing their language.... What they did is they stayed focused  on
their values and that's what we need to do.

-------------

This is exactly what needs to happen! People with real courage, I mean,  WHAT
THE HELL does Howard Dean believe in anymore anyway!? At least George W.
Bush isn't interested in going against his beliefs: he hates gays, always has,
hasn't changed his mind, doesn't intend to, he's angry about abortion, wants to
 overturn Roe v. Wade, makes no bones about.

Oh please, I can't believe I'm going to say this, but, I have more respect
for Bush! Not that I can ever agree with him, but he acts the way I want the
Democrats to act. I really want, so badly want someone with the certitude Bush
has to say AND REALLY MEAN IT WHEN SHE OR HE SAYS IT, that they believe in
queers and women and will not back down from defending our civil liberties.
This  person does not exist, as far as I can see.

We have nothing but cowards on our side. SHIT! Kate Michelman is saying
something very simple about NOT whimpering NOT turning away NOT giving in AND
DAMMIT STAYING TO FIGHT THIS BATTLE OUT! Fuck the right wing! Fuck the born
agains! How is giving into bigotry ever going to change anything for the  better?

Later on the night of the 8th I went to a demonstration outside Exodus
Church in Philadelphia where Jerry Falwell and Rick Santorum were speaking on
behalf of the Alito nomination. When I saw Falwell walk into that church with
Santorum it made me so angry just to SEE THEM! The HATE that they spread can be
felt! How on earth can any Democrat give into these monsters? At one point we
could hear the minister giving his speech inside the church. He is a black
man,  and he was speaking out against gay marriage, abortion, etc., and there
were  some members of his congregation out on the sidewalk yelling and praying
at us.  I said to one couple, "How would you feel if that were being said about
civil  rights for African Americans? How would you feel if you heard a pastor
of a  church speaking out from the pulpit in favor of segregation?" I'm not
sure if  the couple even heard me, but a few white Quakers who were near me
were upset  with me, saying that I "shouldn't say that!" But why not? I'm only
trying to  create some common ground, isn't that okay? Are my rights as a gay
man any less  important than their rights?

It's so tired hanging with some of these people on "the Left" sometimes.
Everyone's so fucking careful, and for what reason? I mean, the Right says
whatever the fuck they want! It's such fucking bullshit, telling people how to
conduct themselves when you've got Jerry Fucking Falwell and Rick Santorum
giving speeches about the evils of queers and women a few feet away! With scum
like that in the house ALL GLOVES SHOULD COME OFF!

Let the protection and belief in Love get scary on their fascist  asses!

And by the fucking way, our rights are NOT bargaining chips! PERIOD! It's
time to tell Howard Dean and friends to find their strength or to get the hell
out of the way for someone better, someone with some real courage!

Quite seriously,
CAConrad

Interestingly the newspaperman got the part about newspapers wrong.  Ted
Kooser's weekly column is not aimed at rural and small town papers.  It's
available free to any publication that would like to sign up and receive
it via email each week.  You could sign up and run it in your garden club
newsletter if you like.  In fact, if you were a person at the Boston Globe
interested in arts and culture, you could sign up to receive the column
and when you liked one of them enough, you could run it.

Along the these same lines, I would also argue that a
pretense prevades. The whole damn thing is often far
from open, the work often secondary to individual
egos.
Truth is that things have gotten so incentuous in some
parts, as said before, that often one, I should think,

learns how NOT to explore process without benefit of
that daisy chain of gathered and wrecked holes that
seem to keep many of us linked together (in a kind of
choo-choo
train-type thing) and leading, quite frankly, nowhere
-- and, more importantly, to noone (especially when in
such situation of curtains drawn). It is not me who is
important, and this can be difficult to impart, but
the work and how it might shape the individual and our
culture -- as if there are no witnesses but for the
future
 (if we're to claim to value the individual and
belonging to a greater community /culture for which we
are responsible). I just keep plugging along, he said,
like all those folk who became my heroes...and of that

engine, I'd rather be the unlinked caboose, or the
train
car going the other (wrong) way!

Don't know if I've made any sense,
AJ

Ray,

Don't you know how these work. Poetry suddenly had this mind numbing amount=20

Dear Poetics -

I don't live there in the U S of A and where I live,
Australia, we have zilch, zero, no poetry benefactors
other than us poets ourselves. (so the Ruth Lilly
money has just seemed imagined - unreal - since I
first read about it )
But, reading the Boston Globe article and the
subsequent posts - I'm with Maxine Chernoff here. I'm
with teachers too - almost always.

Best wishes,
Pam Brown

I made a copy of and read at my leisure the Janos Sugar interview with Peter Lamborn Wilson.  It is, without a doubt, the best thing I've read in internet poetry communications in a long time.  I only wish I could share it with more poets and people.  Perhaps if the publisher or someone put it on the web as a separate posting rather than just an address at the end of an ad more people might read it.

"Ostensibly a volume of poems, this dense glossary packs the deep

Institutions is neither poetry nor prose while obviously both—because
buried in these pages we find wrinkled love letters from our
spiritual ancestors reincarnated as the crinkly cartography of our
future utopia."

Peter Lamborn Wilson founded The Moorish Orthodox Radio Crusade on

Brain dead is right. And for an organization whose strategy claims to be so

Honestly, I think it's time for a coup. What'll happen next is they'll be d=
rilling for poetry in Independent forests. Going to war with your more 'dev=
iant' poetic journals like Chain or No (perhaps thay, too, have weapons of =
mass deconstruction). Who knows. Is this bickering or what?

Can someone please come up with a list of things we can actually buy with t=
hat kind of money, like, maybe, The Center for Poetic Studies (that's hypot=
hetical) on the east coast.

money buys money. doesn't it seem clear that they should invest the endowment in solid, eco-friendly, politically nontoxic funds and use the ongoing revenue to fund (innovative, wide-reaching, birth-giving) programs and scholarships, to be determined? and ditch the shmancy offices, and get to some readings within the community and beyond, and, hell yeah, lower their own admission price (the savings generated by non-scmancy offices will help with that).

NEW TITLES FROM STRIDE, MARCH 2006

name   , an errant     rob mclennan
ISBN 1-905024-061     £8.50     86pp     pbck     March 2006

Using sparse language, name    , an errant writes a complex line of
breaks, naming, and breaking down. In Canadian poet rob mclennan's
eleventh poetry collection, he writes the poem that begins after
everything has fallen apart, and slowly struggles to put itself back
together. These are pieces that exist before hope, and in the expectation
of hope. These are poems that name us and tell us who we are.


"rob mclennan goes the distance between surfaces with each fresh discovery
touching upon a line segment that extends from one's own presence to each
other. The poems engage in learning, knowing, relishing 'nothing in
particular, all the time', inductively revealing everything." Sheila E.
Murphy

"Crisscrossing Canada like a mad pilgrim, rob mclennan keeps his eyes &
ears open - to the unravellings of culture, high & low, past & present.
These poems sing a wild concatenation, 'abt' more than 'mere wishful
thinking', & remember all that's still & continually 'falling through the
cracks' in 'the ruin we call' our civilization. There he is, again,
'writing down sand'."   Douglas Barbour

"In mclennan, a whole tradition that has been underground in Canada for
almost half a century has found a new champion.   Harold Rhenisch, Arc




HYMNS TO THE GOD IN WHICH MY TYPEWRITER BELIEVES
Robert Sheppard
ISBN 1-905024-05-3     £8.50     94pp     pbck     March 2006

These poems - the first to appear after Sheppard completed his epic
Twentieth Century Blues - riff off other works of art, as both text and
commentary. The materials selected, many of them by European artists, are
unexpected new cultural referents for Sheppard: from the visual works of
Charlotte Saloman to Hugo Dachinger, from particular drafts and poems by
Anne Sexton and Veronica Forrest-Thomson, from surreal 'translations' of
Sephardic songs to investigations of the ode and the anti-poem. Familiar
Sheppard themes emerge in these borrowed contexts, from the Holocaust to
September 11. The voice is quieter, but no less compelling, serious or
jocular, the visual opportunities of page-space part of the poems'
exacting design.

'Sheppard is a rhizomiste. This means he has found a form for his epic
Twentieth Century Blues project that could sprout off in any direction
without warning, like a potato; and it does, in poems drawing on blues and
jazz mythologies, as well as literary and social theory, and a staggering
range of other twentieth century odds and sods. A half-subverted leftism
ranges widely over a channel hopper's collage from late night satellite
television.'
John Muckle, The Poetry Review

'[The Lores] is tremendously serious in its reflections on history and in
its proposals for how such reflections can help us live in the present.'
Scott Thurston, Tears In the Fence

'Here are the discourses on our moment - political, literary, media,
advertising - saturated with echoes of great literature so as to produce a
dense weave of language registers that prompt a truly Joycean
"laughtears".'
Marjorie Perloff on Tin Pan Arcadia

This ongoing dialogue about the Poetry Foundation (mis)endowment is
fascinating. Ray & you all who've commented on this, the points you've made
are salient and right.

It's uncanny that the fortress attitude, the "screw all you locals" attitude
that the Poetry Foundation seems to have in regards to how they've been
strategizing what to do with their enormous endowment, illustrates one main
theme of The MacArthur Foundation's "Chicago as a Global City" report, which
was published a few years ago. Among other things, the report states that
Chicago's "assets remain fragmented, seldom cooperating, islands, rather
than an archipelago" (see
http://www.globalchicago.org/reports/arch/MacArthur.pdf).

Poetry is art and should be prophetic and challenging. There is much poetry
that is good and great in the US but there is a sea of crap too- it has
always been that way since Dante, Since whoever wrote the Psalms.

POETRY Magazine is a cyst on the neck of Poetry the artform.
Here we are in Chicago with a large and interesting poetry scene, small
presses that are funded mostly from people's bank accounts and struggle to
survive and we have in our midst POETRY magazine with its millions.
POETRYdoes nothing for our community or Poetry in city that it calls home in
fact I have NEVER seen Christian Wiman at ANY poetry event in this city
except AWP two years ago.

I am sorry but POETRY Magazine makes me sick they spent millions on a study
to find out why people don't read poetry when they could have given that
money to 30 small press or reading series or MFA programs and really made an
impact. They got new offices in a LSD high rise when they could have opened
a Literary Center in Chicago which we desperately need and with all their
money they charge $12.00 to go to their readings.

If you imagine that university professors and teachers are at fault for
making poetry difficult or inscrutable or less popular than you imagine it
should be, I ask you to search your memory for a time when a teacher
actually taught you something, even about poetry, maybe? I would guess that
most people who think well of poetry haven't been poisoned by teachers or
become victims of the conspiracy that keeps poetry from "the people." And if
you imagine that POETRY magazine and its minions are going to to do more
good than the thousands of well-intentioned and even excellent teachers in
the world and programs already in existence like Poetry in the Schools,
Teachers and Writers Collective, just to name a few, you're probably wrong.
WHile I've heard many people in life who aren't even poets praising their
teachers, I have yet to hear many people say that their experience reading
Poetry: A Magazine of Verse, has changed their lives. One might also ask why
big money and conservative power want to work in the poetry field. I'm not
that fond of missionaries, for instance, for the good work they do in the
field. I trust them less than teachers.

Royal (Adventures in Poetry), of which John Ashbery wrote, =B3Everything is

Jordan Davis' new book is The Moon Is Moving: Million Poems Journal II
(Faux). He is in the middle of the second season of The Million Poems Show,
a monthly poetry talk show he hosts at the Bowery Poetry Club. He is a

worked twelve years as Kenneth Koch's editorial assistant; he also wrote th=
e

After reading people's comments on this Boston Globa article; I have thought
that something that could start the conversation about how Poetry Magazine
is wasting their money and not supporting poetry as an artform would be to
publish an open letter. Since most of the people on the Buffalo list will
NEVER appear in Poetry the political fallout would be minimal but I think
that if 150 or 200 American poets who are publishing, running presses,
teaching and writing poetry came together and we simply said that our
artform is not really benefiting from this great gift it might create some
debate rather than gushing NPR stories and newspaper articles.

Last year Christian Wiman appeared on a local Right wing intellectual show
here called Extension 720 with Milt Rosenberg. They devoted an entire two
hour program to poetry and reading and talking about poetry. It was not who
they included but who they excluded that indicates what they are about the
following poets were not even mentioned by Mr Wiman.

Robert Creeley, Maxine Chernoff, Russell Edson, Robert Duncan, Jack Spicer,
Ted Berrigan, Robert Olson, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, Paul Hoover, H.D.,
John Ashbery,
Frank O'Hara,Alice Notley, and on and on.

The reality is that the biggest elephant in the poetic room is not
interested in poetry as an artform a creative political force, no they are
interested in poetry the way that art museums are interested in paintings as
a means to profit and to do blockbuster artshows.

I think that their agenda needs to be opposed.

I'm curious, though:  who _did_ they include?  among living poets, I mean.....is
there a transcript available?

The _Globe_ story was relatively good, I thought--somewhat critical at least.

I like your open letter idea.

It's been blocked, along with Wikipedia, BBC, of
course, countless others, along with many
"anonymizers" -- in fact, my computer use is

this is a tool for finding and viewing images on any topic. type the

ps: have been following the POETRY thread with great interest. have started
about five emails on the subject, but deleted them all before sending. what
occurs to me at this moment is that if you look at what some excellent poets
have given poetry and poets--the works and their other work--it dwarfs what
this organization has achieved so far, from what i read. it really does seem
to be a question of the richness, generosity, and resourcefulness of
imagination that brings forth good things relevant and useful to poetry. i
hope they are able to do wonderful things with that money, ultimately. but
what it shows us, so far, is where the real riches are, concerning
poetry--they aren't in the bank.

Yes, these are blocked, as are blogs... I can go to blogger.com to update my
blog (http://marcacci.blogspot.com/> *snickers*, although I can never visit
the site to see the results. I use a proxy server to access the site, and
those don't seem to be blocked here. Or they haven't caught up with it
yet...

It makes it a little tedious to read blogs but, at least for the time being,
this is a good workaround. I've actually come across a number of websites,
mostly poetry related, which also seem to be blocked, although I haven't
investigated. Seems a little strange that some of those podunk poetry sites
are blocked... I should start keeping a list...

I know Alex is still learning about all this techno mumbo-jumbo, but we're
doing our best to follow all y'all back in the states...

yes eventually. at the moment it's more like a slideshow. but taking it from
dbslideshow to dbcinema is something i hope eventually to write.

and if you type in

"George Bowering" | "David Bromige"

that means 'gb or db' and you get a slideshow mostly of gb. on the internet,
there's a picture of you taken for just about each year you've walked the
earth, george.

The _Globe_ story was relatively good, I thought--somewhat critical at

CALL FOR PAPERS
The Changing Face of African Literature

The Centre for African Literary Studies, in conjunction with the 9th annual Time of the Writer international writers festival in Durban, is hosting a conference on The Changing Face of African Literature March 21-23, 2006, in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal.

African literature does not look as it did when it was first established as a field of academic study in the 1960s. Africa itself has changed enormously since the first generation of writers appeared just before and after independence, and the needs and concerns of its writers have changed greatly as a consequence. Africans have undergone terrible ordeals and have developed resourceful strategies to deal with them. A younger generation, the literary grandchildren of Senghor, Achebe, and Soyinka, have moved onto the stage with very different concerns than their predecessors, yet too often academics talk as if the die had been cast by the first generation of postcolonial writers. There are more women writing than ever before, but they are still outnumbered. There is more writing in African languages but the danger of being swamped by English and French is also greater than ever before. Colonization has receded into the past, yet globalization and neo-colonialism pose challenge!
 s of their own at least as great. All the old certainties of nation-state and Pan-Africanism have been challenged; all are still with us. Whereas the first generation of writers and academics had to prove Africa was capable of high literature, there is now more freedom to explore popular culture. There is an African film industry. And there are new challenges that literature is only tentatively beginning to explore: such as AIDS, child soldiers, the triumph of global capitalism, the destruction of the natural environment, and the rise of religion as a political force.

We invite papers (of about 20 minutes in length) dealing with aspects of what is new in African literature since 1990 or discerning the lineaments of African literature today. We are interested in literature from all of the continent south of the Sahara, written in English, French, and Portuguese as well as in languages that originated in Africa. Papers may deal with single texts, single authors, or with larger themes explored across several texts. We invite papers about pedagogy as well as literary criticism. Paper Proposals should indicate a Title, Name and Affiliation of proposer, Contact Address [including e-mail & fax], and should be accompanied by a short [one paragraph] abstract. The deadline for proposals for papers is Jan 20, 2006.

Please submit proposals to

Bernard DeMeyer or Neil ten Kortenaar
Centre for African Literary Studies
University of KwaZulu-Natal Pietermaritzburg
Scottsville 3209
South Africa

Or by e-mail to : demeyerb@ukzn.ac.za or to TenKortenaar@ukzn.ac.za

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

40 words, 40 years
365 days, 365 people

I turned 40 on January 12th, 2005, and I wanted to mark the occasion
in some positive fashion. So I got this crazy idea: I know! I'll write
40 words (no more, no less) every day for a year, and each day I'll
write about a different person (in no particular order--in fact, in a
shuffled order) who touched my life in some way. But not just anyone,
it's got to be someone I've actually met in person, someone whose name
I still remember, and someone who was interesting.

Because I often think up great ideas for things that turn out to be
impossible (that darned reality!), the first thing I did was attempt
to make a list of 365 people whose names I remembered and who were
interesting to me. I recommend you try this. Soon. It's a worthwhile
exercise, I promise. Don't think you can do it easy, or you can't do
it, no way, really try it and don't give up easily.

For me, the first 50 or so came lickety-split, easy-peasy. The second
50 were not too tough. After that, it got really tough, really
fast. When I got to 200 I honestly thought this was going to be
impossible. When I got to 300 I was pretty much certain it was
impossible and I thought I was going to need to relent on the
restriction that I had to remember their name. I have lost a lot of
names from my memory. I still have faces, and the floorplans of houses
and the shapes of mouths, and the words they used, but I have lost the
names.

40 words is a tiny lens to look through. How do you put a mother, an
ex-wife, a best friend, or the love of your life into 40 words when
that's not even enough for the junior high math teacher, or the son of
the guy who sold meats and cheeses to the place you worked? There's
only one way to find out.

Try this: make a list of 365 people whose names you remember and who
were interesting to you. Even if you don't want to write 40 about
each, at least try making the list. And then, if you can, write down a
few words about each of them before they're gone from your memory. If
you can't do this, it might be wise to spend the next 365 days meeting
more people in person who are interesting to you. Learn their names.

This is the only time I'll post to this list about this project,
though I will be posting them daily to the WRYTING-L list (where the
regular posting of experiments seems more appropriate), and also to a
blog set up for this limited purpose at:

http://www.logolalia.com/40x365/

I have begun with my mom because, well, I began with my mom, and this
is being begun on my birth day. The rest will be done from a list
whose order has been shuffled.

Regards,
Dan

  As a part of the Steinbeck Chair program, we are looking for all kinds of poets – school students to retirees, novice beginners to published Pulitzer Prize-winning poets to create 10,000 poems over one year. We are looking for writers from diverse perspectives and backgrounds. Poems can reflect the rich cultural heritage of the Salinas Valley or are representative of the specific place you call home. The 10,000 Poems Project seeks to celebrate the lives of our fellow residents and their personal journeys. Poems can be on whatever topic you wish, and do not need to relate to or mention John Steinbeck.

MSA 8=E2=80=94OUT OF THE ARCHIVES
19-22 October 2006
Tulsa, Oklahoma

CALL FOR SEMINAR, ROUNDTABLE, AND PANEL PROPOSALS

http://www.utulsa.edu/jjq/msa8

The 2006 meeting of the Modernist Studies Association will take place at=20
the Downtown Doubletree Hotel in Tulsa, Oklahoma from 19-22 October.=20
Founded in 1999, the MSA is devoted to the interdisciplinary study of=20
the arts in their social, political, cultural, and intellectual contexts=20
from the late nineteenth through the twentieth century. The=20
organization=E2=80=99s annual conference regularly brings together in exces=
s of=20
500 scholars from a variety of disciplines and features an engaging mix=20
of keynote addresses, small seminars, panel presentations, and=20
roundtable discussions. This year the event will be hosted by the=20
University of Tulsa with generous financial support provided by the=20
National Endowment for the Humanities, the James Joyce Quarterly, the=20
Modernist Journals Project, and Tulsa Studies in Women=E2=80=99s Literature=
.

Although the organizers welcome seminar and panel proposals on any topic=20
related to the organization=E2=80=99s focus, particular preference will be =
given=20
to those which consider the ways in which visual, literary, cinematic,=20
journalistic, personal, financial, musical, and other sorts of archives=20
have begun to alter the structure and boundaries of aesthetic modernism.=20
Detailed information about the conference=E2=80=94including updated calls f=
or=20
proposals, housing arrangements, travel information, and details=20
regarding subsidiary events--can be found on-line at=20
http://www.utulsa.edu/jjq/msa8 . All email queries should be directed to=20
the conference organizers at msa8@utulsa.edu.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

* All who attend the MSA conference must be members of the organization=20
with dues paid for 2006-2007. (MSA membership runs from October to=20
September.)

* Because we wish to involve as many people as possible as active=20
participants, MSA does not permit multiple appearances on the program.=20
That is, one cannot give papers in two sessions, or be both a seminar=20
leader and a panelist or roundtable participant. However, panelists,=20
roundtable participants, and plenary speakers who also wish to=20
participate in a seminar or a "What Are You Reading?" session may=20
certainly do so. And of course one may chair a session and also appear=20
elsewhere on the program.

* MSA rules do not allow panel or roundtable organizers to chair their=20
own session if they are also speaking in the session. Organizers are=20
encouraged to identify a moderator and include this information with=20
their proposals; the MSA Program Committee is also able to help you=20
secure another conference attendee's service as moderator.



CALL FOR SEMINAR PROPOSALS

Deadline: Tuesday, February 28, 2006

Seminars are one the most significant features of the MSA conference.=20
Participants write brief "position papers" (5-7 pages) that are read and=20
circulated prior to the conference. With no more than 15 participants,=20
seminars generate lively exchange and sometimes produce networks of=20
scholars who continue to work together beyond the conference. The format=20
also allows most conference attendees to seek financial support from=20
their institutions as they educate themselves and their colleagues on=20
subjects of mutual interest. Seminars are two hours in length.

Please note that this is the call for seminar leaders. Sign-ups for=20
seminar participants will take place on a first-come, first-served basis=20
starting in mid-March, coinciding with registration for the conference.

Seminar Topics

There are no limits on topics, but past experience has shown that the=20
more clearly defined the topic and the more guidance provided by the=20
leader, the more productive the discussion. To scan past seminar topics,=20
go to the Conference Archives=20
<http://msa.press.jhu.edu/archive/archive.html> on the MSA website,=20
click the link to a prior conference, and then click on "Conference=20
Schedule" or "Conference Program." You'll find seminars listed along=20
with panels and other events.

Proposing a Seminar

Seminar proposals must be submitted via email and must include the=20
following information. Please assist us by sending this information in=20
exactly the order given here:

* Use as a subject line: SEMINAR PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF SEMINAR=20
LEADER] (e.g., SEMINAR PROPOSAL / GORMAN)

* List the seminar leader's name, institutional affiliation, discipline,=20
position or title, mailing address, phone, fax, and e-mail address

* Provide a brief curriculum vitae (including teaching experience) for=20
the seminar leader

* Give a brief description (up to 100 words) of the proposed topic


Submit proposals by Tuesday, February 28, 2006 to:

msa8seminars@utulsa.edu

Seminars will be selected mid-March 2006.



CALL FOR PANEL PROPOSALS

Deadline: Tuesday, May 9, 2006

There are no limits on topics, but please bear in mind these guidelines:

* We encourage interdisciplinary panels and discourage panels on single=20
authors.

* In order to encourage discussion, we prefer panels with three=20
participants, though panels of four will be considered.

* Panels composed entirely of participants from a single department at a=20
single institution are not likely to be accepted.

* Graduate students are welcome as panelists. However, panels composed=20
entirely of graduate students are less likely to be accepted than panels=20
that include degreed presenters together with graduate students.

Proposals for panels must be submitted via email and must include the=20
following information. Please assist us by sending this information in=20
exactly the order given here:

* Use as a subject line: PANEL PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF PANEL ORGANIZER]=20
(e.g., PANEL PROPOSAL / GORMAN)

* Session title

* Session organizer's name, institutional affiliation, discipline,=20
position or title, mailing address, phone, fax, and e-mail address

* Chair's name, institutional affiliation, discipline, position or=20
title, and contact information (if you do not identify a chair, we will=20
locate one for you)

* Panelists' names, paper titles, institutional affiliations,=20
disciplines, positions or titles, and contact information

* A maximum 500-word abstract of the panel as a whole

* Brief (2-3 sentence) scholarly biography of each panelist

Send proposals by Tuesday, May 9, 2006 to:

msa8panels@utulsa.edu

Panels will be selected mid-June.



CALL FOR ROUNDTABLE PROPOSALS

Deadline: Tuesday, May 9, 2006

Unlike panels, which generally feature a sequence of 15-20 minutes talks=20
followed by discussion, roundtables gather a group of participants=20
around a shared concern in order to generate discussion among the=20
roundtable participants and with the audience. To this end, instead of=20
delivering full-length papers, participants typically deliver short=20
position statements in response to questions distributed in advance by=20
the organizer, or they take turns responding to prompts from the=20
moderator. The bulk of the session should be devoted to discussion. No=20
paper titles are listed in the program, only the names of participants.

Other MSA roundtable policies:

* Roundtables may feature as many as 6 speakers.

* We particularly welcome roundtables featuring participants from=20
multiple disciplines, and we discourage roundtables on single authors.

* Panels composed entirely of participants from a single department at a=20
single institution are not likely to be accepted.

* Graduate students are welcome as speakers. However, roundtables=20
composed entirely of graduate students are less likely to be accepted=20
than roundtables that include degreed presenters together with graduate=20
students.

Proposals for panels must be submitted via email and must include the=20
following information. Please assist us by sending this information in=20
exactly the order given here:

* Use as a subject line: ROUNDTABLE PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF ROUNDTABLE=20
ORGANIZER] (e.g., ROUNDTABLE PROPOSAL / GORMAN)

* Session title

* Session organizer's name, institutional affiliation, discipline,=20
position or title, mailing address, phone, fax, and e-mail address

* Moderator's name, institutional affiliation, discipline, position or=20
title, and contact information (if you do not identify a moderator, we=20
will locate one for you)

* Speakers' names, institutional affiliations, disciplines, positions or=20
titles, mailing addresses, phones, faxes, and e-mail addresses

* A maximum 500-word rationale for the roundtable

* Brief (2-3 sentence) scholarly biography of each speaker

Send proposals by Tuesday, May 9, 2006 to:

msa8roundtables@utulsa.edu

Roundtables will be selected mid-June.

Hello Alex,
That's too bad -  I don't think Jacket's all that
dangerous in the imperialism/foreign devil stakes.
It will all be up there in cyberspace whenever you're

All good wishes,

 WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT

PRACTICAL CRITICISM: A POETRY WORKSHOP =E2=80=93 TONY TOWLE
TUESDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 14TH
=20
=E2=80=9CIt is assumed that participants will be serious, practicing poets and so
critiques and comments will be made from the vantage point of what the
person has already established, not with a view to =E2=80=98prescribing=E2=80=99 some
different way of writing. However, stretching the sensibility will be
encouraged, both in the group and through individual suggestion. Non-bindin=
g
assignments will be given each week and poems from the past as well as thos=
e
of the workshop participants will be read aloud and discussed. In the cours=
e
of this, numerous poets past and present, and topics both literary and
general, will arise and be talked about. Also I will make written comments
on poems individuals may prefer not to have read aloud.=E2=80=9D John Ashbery has
written: =E2=80=9CTony Towle is one of the best-kept secrets of the New York
School.=E2=80=9D Tony=E2=80=99s first reading at the Poetry Project was in 1968. Recent
books include The History of the Invitation: New & Selected Poems 1963-2000=
,
and Memoir 1960-1963.

THE UNPERFORMABLE: THE VISUAL SIDE OF POETRY =E2=80=93 EVELYN REILLY
THURSDAYS at 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 16TH
=20
=E2=80=9CThe traditional notion of poetry as primarily a matter of =E2=80=9Cvoice=E2=80=9D ha=
s often
obscured its graphic and visual character, and can limit the range of
experiment to what can be experienced in the venue of the poetry reading.
Even the most performance-based poets, however, face issues of how to
spatialize their work on the page, and every line break is as much a visual
as a rhythmic and aural decision. This workshop will explore a broad range
of visual poetics =E2=80=94 from modernist innovations to composition-by-field to
recent spatialized text, concrete, collage, and digital poetry. We will
examine work by Mallarme, Apollinaire, cummings, Olson, Schwerner, Hak Kyun=
g
Cha, Aram Saroyan and Susan Howe, and peruse the UbuWeb site together.
Everyone will be encouraged to analyze the visual assumptions behind their
poems as well as to write or revise work using alternative visual
conventions.=E2=80=9D Evelyn Reilly=E2=80=99s book Hiatus was published by Barrow Stree=
t in
2004 and was a finalist for the Poetry Society of America=E2=80=99s Norma Farber

THURSDAYS AT 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN APRIL 6

=E2=80=9CHow do we get the swirling-inside/outside-the-head onto the page? What a=
re
the differences between knowledge and information, and what are we putting
into our poems? Why? We will look at poets & projects confronting these
questions & we will explore our own potential in navigating transitional
space (community, jobs, war, media). We may look at poems by Etel Adnan,
Ammiel Alcalay, Jules Boykoff, Ernesto Cardinal, Roque Dalton, Kevin Davies=
,
Jeff Derksen, Laura Elrick, Heather Fuller, Dana Gelinas, Fanny Howe, Susan
Howe, Pattie McCarthy, Yedda Morrison, Alice Notley, Mark Nowak, Douglas
Oliver, Kristin Prevallet, Deborah Richards, Cristina Rivera-Garza, Kaia
Sand, Leslie Scalapino, and Rodrigo Toscano. We will discuss how we read an=
d
what we value, how to assess the values of any given poem. We may address
contradictions in literal or figurative yogic practice and the
(in)corporate(zation) rush. How can we sustain simultaneously our health an=
d
our engagements with destruction?=E2=80=9D Carol Mirakove is the author of Mediat=

=E2=80=9CIn  this workshop, we will the explore the poetry and poetics of the New
York School of Poetry. A school of writing more linked by personal alliance=
s
and mutual dislikes, it features a dazzling range of approaches ranging fro=

the radical formalism of Edwin Denby to the the permanently =E2=80=9Cunder

(Eileen Myles) poets who are actually read by non-poets (Frank O=E2=80=99 Hara) a=
nd
poets held dear mostly by other New York School Poets (Joe Ceravolo, Steve
Carey and Jim Brodey). We will explore New York School techniques  such as
collaborations, appropriative writing, list poems, cut ups, rewrites, lists=
,
invented forms, reinvented forms, sonnets and the secrets of how-to-keep

SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 18TH
=20
=E2=80=9CWe are making manuscripts of our work (at whatever stage the work or the
poet or both are). As poets we are also looking at and sometimes working
with prose, as another form of poetry, as well other forms of poetry such a=
s
lyrics, raps, spoken word form(ats) or even simple lines =E2=80=93 good in and of
themselves. We practice exercises and routines of the poet. We often listen
to the works of each other =E2=80=93 in progress. And there is always the right t=

We're now featuring interviews with poets at Poetry Circle.

http://www.poetrycircle.com

Typically the interviews will be with poets whose works find their way among
the editors' picks on the site, but I did hoist up a previously unpublished
original interview with Charles Bukowski recently:

http://www.poetrycircle.com/index.php/topic,226.0.html

In the interview, Bukowski discusses letter writing with German translator
Carl Weissner. I'll post lots of other interviews on the site in the coming
weeks and months as well.

I invite you all to join the site and submit your work. So far I've
generally been pleased with the quality of work submitted, especially given
the nature of the site, which is open to all. Here's an overview of the
editorial concept:

http://www.poetrycircle.com/index.php/topic,14.0.html

I'm trying to cultivate an outlet for serious poetry, with a bent toward
experimental works. Hope to see you there. And if you're interested in
helping out as an editor of the site, please sign up and send a message to
one of the existing editors. Thanks and take care.

Subject:      I am we (from revolutionary suicide)
MIME-Version: 1.0

I am we


So many of my comrades are gone now. Some tight partners, crime
partners, and brothers off the block are begging on the street. Others
are in asylum, penitentiary, or grave. They are all suicides of one kind
of another who had the sensitivity and tragic imagination to see the
oppression. Some overcame; they are the revolutionary suicides.
Others were reactionary suicides who either overestimated or
underestimated the enemy, but in any case were powerless to change their
conception of the oppressor.


I am we
by huey p newton


There is an old African saying, "I am we." If you met an African in
ancient times and asked him who he was, he would reply, "I am we. This
is revolutionary suicide: I, we, all of us are the one and the multitude.

So many of my comrades are gone now. Some tight partners, crime
partners, and brothers off the block are begging on the street. Others
are in asylum, penitentiary, or grave. They are all suicides of one kind
of another who had the sensitivity and tragic imagination to see the
oppression. Some overcame; they are the revolutionary suicides. Others
were reactionary suicides who either overestimated or underestimated the
enemy, but in any case were powerless to change their conception of the
oppressor.

The differences lies in hope and desire. By hoping and desiring, the
revolutionary suicide chooses life; he is, in the words of Nietzsche,
"an arrow of longing for another shore." Both suicides despise tyranny,
but the revolutionary is both a great despiser and a great adorer who
longs for another shore.

The reactionary suicide must learn, as his brother the revolutionary has
learned, that the desert is not a circle. It is a spiral. When we have
passed through the desert, nothing will be the same.

You cannot bare your throat to the murderer. As George Jackson said, you
must defend yourself and take the dragon position as in karate and make
the front kick and the back kick when you are surrounded. You do not beg
because your enemy comes with the butcher knife and the hatchet in the
other. "He will not become a Buddhist over night."

The Preacher said that the wise man and the fool have the same end: they
go to the grave as a dog. Who sends us to the grave? The unknowable, the
force that dictates to all classes, all territories, all ideologies; he
is death, the Big Boss. An ambitious man seeks to dethrone the Big Boss,
to free himself, to control when and how he will go to the grave.

There is another illuminating story of the wise man and the fool, found
in Mao's Little Red Book. A foolish old man went to the North Mountain
and began to dig; a wise old man passed by and said, "Why do you dig;
foolish old man? Do you not know that you cannot move the mountain with
a little shovel?" But the foolish old man answered resolutely, "While
the mountain cannot get any higher, it will get lower with each
shovelful. When I pass on, my sons and his sons and his son's sons will
go on making the mountain lower. Why can't we move the mountain?"

And the foolish old man kept digging, and the generations that followed
after him, and the wise old man looked on in disgust. But the
resoluteness and the spirit of the generations that followed the foolish
old man touched God's heart, and God sent two angels who put the
mountain on their backs and moved the mountain.

This is the story Mao told. When he spoke of God he meant the six
hundred million who had helped him to move imperialism and bourgeois
thinking, the two great mountains.

The reactionary suicide is "wise," and the revolutionary suicide is a
"fool," a fool for the revolution in the way Paul meant when he spoke of
being "a fool for Christ." That foolishness can move the mountains of
oppression; it is our great leap and our commitment to the dead and the
unborn.

We will touch God's heart; we will touch the people's heart, and
together we will move the mountain.

Living next to  bending smoke flecked with muscle with tissue upon rasped voices savage  and just woke up, Mary's first morning Marlboro hangs acrid in the hot  pinched air of our little yellow bedroom, now brown with syntax. When  the kids are off to school and the house contracts to you again, and  your work, you sit down in this struggle with light every morning  brings, and you read Knuth's Art of Computer Programming, and  all that math you don't know(product of Lorain City Schools). But  motherfucker, don't you understand that's no excuse? It's a warm dark  winter again, and love is angled around you, splitting off in serial  streams

me with interest in reading, I believe I have secured a venue.  If you
are still interested (or are just now interested), backchannel me at
grant-jenkins@utulsa.edu and let me know when you plan to arrive in

Tuesday, January 17th, 7 pm at City Lights Books

Etel Adnan celebrates the release of In the Heart of the Heart of Another
Country, published by City Lights Books


A haunting memoir that explores identity, history, displacement, and war
from an Arab American perspective.

A mosaic of lyrical vignettes, at once deeply personal and political, set
against the turbulent backdrop of Arab/ Western relations, from the violent
legacy of T.E. Lawrence to the contemporary catastrophes of Lebanon and the
war on Iraq. Adnan writes, “Contrary to what is usually believed, it is not
general ideas and grandiose unfolding of great events that impress the mind
during times of heightened historic upheavals, but rather the uninterrupted
flow of little experiences, observations, disturbances, small ecstasies, or
barely perceptible discouragements that make up day-to-day living.”

Etel Adnan, a Lebanese American poet, painter, and essayist, lives in Paris,
Beirut, and the San Franciso Bay Area. Among her books, the novel Sitt Marie
Rose is considered a classic of Middle Eastern Literature. She has been
powerful voice for compassion and empowerment in feminist and antiwar
movements.

   For years now, I've maintained a personal website that served more as an archive for my work than anything else.
  While such repositories are useful,they can get dusty, and they  don't often utilize the community-building power of Internet  technology. The net should be a place where nodes intersect and  collide, not a dead museum or drab resume. ight?
  Thus, I'm opening up lewislacook.org to the community--for  collaboration, announcments, discussion, personal blogging, even  collaborative text creation...Mostly, I'd love to see here discussions  and meetings on net.art, algorithmic art, netcinema and the like. But I  also hope to see pure code-talk as well--specifically the usage of Open  Source technologies.

Dear Grant:

  I am very much interested in reading.  This is a great idea.   I plan to be in Austin on Thursday and to leave, most probably, on  Saturday evening.  I have a reading scheduled with Ahsahta Press  on Saturday afternoon (1:30-2:45pm) as my collection of prose poems  FENCE ABOVE THE SEA came out mid-September through that press.   Here is a link to my webpage on the Ahsahta website  http://www.boisestate.edu/english/ahsahta/books/byrd.htm.  I just  finished a second manuscript, which I am starting to send out.  So  indeed, I am now working on a new project. . . .

  Last year, I had the opportunity to read off site with "poetics" poets  during the MLA conference and thoroughly enjoyed being a part of this  event.

  I hope to hear from you soon,

  Best,

  Brigitte Byrd

Thinking of poetry as performance, but not necessarily separating the
poem from its performance, I would appreciate it if Poetics
subscribers (*lurkers alert!*) would provide a list of the poetry
readings that you most valued over the past few years. If possible
(though hardly necessary!),  please provide a description of the
style of performance or performances and also discuss what you
particularly valued about the reading or readings.

In Memory of My Feelings-Frank O'Hara.~Edited and with an afterword by Bill
Berkson. Between 1952, when Frank O'Hara published his first collection of
poems, and his death, in 1966, at the early age of forty, he became
recognized as a quintessential American poet whose vernacular phrasing, both
worldly and lyrical, beautifully told of the urban life of his generation.
In addition to the contribution he made to American literature, O'Hara was a
vital figure in the New York cultural scene and spent many years working at
The Museum of Modern Art, where, having begun by taking a job selling
postcards on the admissions desk, he ultimately became an associate curator
in the Department of Painting and Sculpture. And when he unexpectedly died,
in an accident on the beach at Fire Island, New York, he was deeply mourned
by the Museum's staff and by the New York art world. In Memory of My
Feelings was published by the Museum in 1967 to honor its late curator. The
book was edited by the poet Bill Berkson, who had been a close friend of
O'Hara's and was then a guest editor in the Museum's Department of
Publications. Berkson invited thirty artists* who had known O'Hara, ranging
from Willem de Kooning to Claes Oldenburg, from Joan Mitchell to Jasper
Johns, to produce works to accompany his poems. The book was issued in a
limited edition as a set of folded sheets held loose in a cloth-and-board
folio that was itself contained in a slipcase. Now, for the first time, the
Museum has republished In Memory of My Feelings in a conventionally bound
edition, and with a newly designed paper jacket instead of a slipcase. In
every other way, however, this book is an exact facsimile of the edition of
1967.

  TOP 5 READINGS/ LAST FEW YEARS

  1) Anne Waldman, New England College, 2006, w/ jazz musician Roy Nathanson. Anne is the heir of the Beat tradition. Her no-holds-barred assault-on-the-senses performance aesthetic is a force to be reckoned with. Combined w/ the Ornette Coleman-ish Free Jazz stylings of Jazz Passengers stalwart Roy Nathanson, Waldman's harangues, exhortations, and shamanistic invocations took on a preternatural power.

  2) Jeffrey Ethan Lee, Robin's Books, Philadelphia, 2005. Jeff Lee's "Identity Papers" recall an incident that took place between Lee and a street-walking bum years ago. To make a long story short, the bum attacked Lee with a hammer, and the dramatic poem recounts this. It's a visceral, gripping, incendiary piece of writing, and Lee delievered it with precision & panache.

  3) C.A. Conrad, Poetry Incarnation '05, Philadelphia, 2005. Conrad read a portion of Ginsberg's HOWL in sync with a tape of Lorenzo Thomas, his friend who (I believe) died last year. Conrad's delivery played up the incantatory power of Allen's words, and the 100 + crowd created an intense ambience that added to the effect.

  4) John Ashbery, East Village, spring '05. Ashbery read from his new book. His reading was precise, engaging, and matter-of-fact, which served to underline the understated pathos of the new poems.

  5) Michael Waters, New England College, '06. Waters is a masterful Centrist poet whose throaty rich voice knows how to savor consonants & vowels. He writes a lot about sex, and his own particular take on the erotic (complete with "nine inch dildos slathered with monkey oil") never fails to register memorably.

Charles Bernstein told me to send this and I usually listen to what he says.

When I was working at Samuel French I actually talked to Shelley
Winters--she was in town in search of a play to do, wanted scripts sent to
her. I remember that she sounded, well, drunk and it was like 2:30 p.m.  By
that time, the lack of sobriety of actors, writers and any other kind of
performer did not phase me.  But it was Shelley Winters and she was a
terrific actress as anyone who ever saw her in The Diary of Anne Frank or An
American Tragedy or those silly 50's comedies where she played the floozy
secretary who woke up, told off her loverboy boss and clicked her heels out
the door.

It's January and those two faces are showing.  As I excavate the stuff in my
apartment, I look back, when I throw stuff out or "re-gift" or send off to
the Salvation Army, I prepare for the future.  The past few weeks have
brought news of illness in the poetry world:  Akua Lezli Hope struggling to
regain her limbs in Rochester; the mighty Bill Kushner suffering strokes in
Manhattan.  We are all in our own ways trying to help our sisters and
brothers.  We may need that help ourselves at some later date.

We had a January thaw before there was any thing to thaw and it is now over.
  Sleet and snow and cold--real January weather is here.  Maybe it is the
lingering darkness of the mornings, but I welcome the noisy precipitation.
It will make spring seem that much more lovely when it comes.

2005 was a year of tremendous loss:  Ossie Davis, Lorenzo Thomas, Rosa
Parks, the remarkable vulgarian, Richard Pryor and the homes, lives and
cohesive culture of the Gulf Region and New Orleans.  As for our adventures
in war mongering, well now there are close to 3000 Americans dead and
countless Iraquis.

I get this weird feeling that Iraq may well have a democracy of some sort in
the next few years; I am not so sure about this country given the TURN BACK
THE CLOCK AND CLOSE OUR EYES TO THE FUTURE UNLESS IT ONLY INCLUDES THE VERY
RICH JUDGES, LEGISLATORS AND PRESIDENTS WHO WANT TO BE MONARCHS that we seem
to be getting.

For all those people who say there is no difference between the Democrats
and the Republicants, think of thedifference between Tip O'Neill and Tom
DeLay--both powerful, both tough, both with ethical issues, but one is so
sleazy, so nasty, so over the top that his current problems in Texas seem
like poetic justice.  In the same way that Ronald Reagan's last years as an
empty suit devoid of charm was perfect payback for a man who's decision
destroyed any chance for democratic and progressive government in Central
America and whose economic policies have made the rich really really richer
and given us homelessness as a national and chronic problem.

Janus may have been wise, I can't remember, but the idea of being able to
simultaneously look behind and ahead seems like what poets do when we are
really in our game.  May you (poets and all others) play the game well.  Ms.
Winters did, even if she drank just a bit too much and ate just a bit too
much.  She had a lot of fun.  We ought to have fun too.

Peace,

Patricia Spears Jones

  Friends, Fellow Poets,

    Self-publishing is a funny thing. It may be transgressive/ regressive, but most of us have done it at one time or another. So, having turned PFS Post into an outlet for world post-avant poetry other than mine, I'm taking the leap back into DIY land with a new blog, "Stoning the Devil", at this rather obvious URL: www.adamfieled.blogspot.com. I'll be publishing poems, anecdotes, journal type entries, meditations on life, love, the pursuit of venereal satisfaction & all the rest of it. Please join me. And, of course, check out what's new at PFS Post (www.artrecess.blogspot.com): stevenallenmay, Steve Halle, and (in a few hours) Rob McLennan.

Charles,

Red Sky Poetry Theater, in Seattle, is in hiatus at this time, after
losing a venue in use since 1994. Before that were other venues in
Seattle, at The Pike Place Market and elsewhere since 1980. I came of age at this
reading, as it was an intergenerational open mic, attracted many
quality poets: Marion Kimes; Paul Hunter; Michael Hureaux; Judith
Roche; Nico Vassilakis & others,) booked quality features (including
giving many poets their first features,) and did not suffer fools.

I co-created the Northwest SPokenword LAB (SPlab!) based, in part, on
that model, and our Living Room is the only regular venue in the Puget
Sound region which offers a literary salon in which writers can get
feedback for their work. http://www.splab.org


These are two different styles, the second of which is designed with
feedback as an intentional part of the setup, whereas at Red Sky it was
a by-product of the venue. I hope this is helpful.

Charles,

I appreciate your kind words and of course, your dedication and
contribution to the field for so many years. I actually back-channeled
you, as I don't think I can actually post to the list. (I tried, when
someone asked about the Chicago radio program Extension 720 and a poetry
feature it once did.)

As for the SPokenword LAB, my involvement in the reading side of things
ends in May after a ten year involvement. We have tried to archive as
much as we can at: http://splab.org/archives.html and our visiting poet
seies at: http://splab.org/visitingpoet.html where you will also find
sound in the form of mp3's from interviews I have done with Visiting
Poets. (Radio is my first calling, then poetry.) SPLAB! will continue as
a travelling workshop troupe (THAT actually /pays/) and in some form
on-line, perhaps to be resumed in 10 or 20 years as a venue again.

I have begun to archive my own activities more seriously in the last
year or so at:
http://www.globalvoicesradio.org/paul-nelson-community-activities.html

Again, thanks for your kind words and continued success and wellness to
you.

Paul

reading, something like a sauna & an endless meal out in the open & as if =
time was a very good bottle of wine to be enjoyed slowly and with friends. =
 Clark was just relentless!  Normally I wouldn=92t be a big fan of very =
very long readings.  I loved this one & was fit to climb a mountain after =
it.  Wrote about it on British & Irish Poets at the time:

ANOTHER EXCELLENT READING
Catherine Walsh & Billy Mills at the SoundEye International Poetry =
Festival in Cork in July 2005.  Catherine brought back all the sounds of =
my childhood for me: when we were out playing after dark & should have =
been home.  I wrote about this on British & Irish Poets too (scroll down):

FIRST READING I EVER TRULY ENJOYED
Alan Dugan at the Fine Arts Center in Provincetown.  I was sweeping the =
floor of the
Barn and listening to a tape I had borrowed of Dugan=92s reading in the =
Hudson D. Walker Gallery, a few yards away, the night before.  I had given =
up trying to go to readings with a baby.  But later I met him during =
another reading, both of us outside the door, me with a baby, Dugan I =
don=92t know why, maybe for a cigarette.  He was 65 and thrilled to be =
getting Social Security.  I was 30 =96 a long time to wait, through a lot =
of readings, for one that WOKE ME UP!  He was funny, as romantic as a =
classicist can be, inimitable but even I tried to imitate him (his =
Brooklyn accent): his poems were sort of chased, like silver.  I'm glad I =
have his voice in my head.

READER I=92M MOST SORRY I MISSED
Kurt Schwitters.

ANOTHER VERY GOOD READING
Caroline Bergvall in the Brown University=92s McCormack Family Theatre in =
Fones Alley in Providence in October 2002, I think.  Bergvall read her =
Dante piece, first lines of The Inferno in every English translation =
available.  Stunning.  The suspense waiting for Mandelbaum=85.Oy Oy!!!

1) Robert Creeley at the Walt Whitman Center in Camden NJ March 2003.

At this reading Creeley was very unassuming and he really connected and
related with the audience which was mostly local people rather than poetic
regulars. There was a gentleness and a confidence that made the reading
soothing and disturbing at the same time.

2) Peter Gizzi at Danny's Tavern Series in Chicago, October of 2004.

Dannys is a weird venue for poetry because it is dark and hard to read.
Peter was paired with Arielle Greenberg whose work is quite hip. Peter in
contrast drew this hipster crowd into something different. He was able to
connect by reading slowly but he also has a regular person accent, not a
faux intellectual accent which is appreciated in Chicago.

3) Jen Hofer at the Discrete Series, in Chicago March 2004.

I read first in this reading and it was a cast of poetic heavyweights. Jen
came in an with her energy and artistic clarity she poked us all in our
eyes. She was so powerful and clear and she drew you into her world.

April, 2001 Talan Memmott, 'Lexia to perplexia', Boston Library, ELO
Electronic Literature awards. Whilst someone navigated through a =
web-based
interactive piece that was projected, talan stood below the screen with =
a
large, very old fashioned analog blackboard. With chalk talan wrote =
certain
words that appeared on the screen, and with each mouse click he would =
make a
connection between words. He used the entire surface of the blackboard, =
even
jumping to reach the highest parts. It was a physical performance =
without a
word spoken from talan, it was the spontaneous creation of a huge =
concrete
poem, it was a theoretical comparative study of various inscription and
performance techniques.

And i can't deny the impact of first experiencing your performance

My own favorite reading of the past year was without a doubt the first half of the Creeley Tribute at St. Mark's over Halloween weekend. The whole thing was too long for my endurance level, but the first half was PERFECT all of itself. I loved it because I could really feel that sense of "company" that Creeley talked about and the love and  respect for the man and his work in that room was so intensely palpable. I can only hope to have that kind of commmunity of poets and artists in my own life. I felt genuinely moved by the confirmation of its possibility at St. Mark's. To quote a poem that I believe (but I have the worst memory) C.D. Wright read: "I want no sentimentality / I want no more than home." I just thought it was amazing.

  My second favorite was probably Lisa Jarnot reading at Taaza here in Providence. I heard her read once before and knew it would be great. After that reading the four other grad students in my year are all teaching Black Dog Songs next semester. Her voice and deadpan delivery is absolutely perfect for her work.

  I saw Jerome Rothenberg a couple of years ago at the Goldmine in New Orleans. He did a piece by Hugo Ball (sans paper suit) and was incredible.

  Best,

  Tod

I will never forget hearing Robert Creeley reading "Histoire de Florida" at
an otherwise dreary AWP meeting in Albany. I had loved Creeley's work, then
lost track of it, and then found it again in Albany.
No sham no artifice just the pure courage to tell the truth. The material,
the poet, and the performance were perfectly unified. That reading made me
remember why I became a poet and the memory of it and of Robert keeps me at
it.

I can seldom remember dates of readings. For example, when was the last
time I heard Creeley read in public? It was 2 or 3 years ago in
Vancouver, I do remember some very well. Like the tenth time I heard
Creeley read was AT THE UBC Vancouver poetry bash in summer 1963, when
the power was turned off by some janitor, and Creeley read to the light
of a hurricane lamp.

I think that in the past year my favourite was the ten minutes by Fanny
Howe at the Griffin awards reading. She was reading to 1000 people, as
were 6 other poets. I remember hers.

I just joined this list.

I saw Alice Notley read here in Ann Arbor, both her work and Ted Berrigan's
and it was delightful. Many others came to read Ted Berrigan's work, too.
Chris Tysh, George Tysh, Ken Mikolowski, it was a lot of fun. And Alice
reading her own work, the next night, was infused with energy and all the
heart I read when I read her work alone.

Ted Hughes read in Victoria at Open Space in Victoria around 1986. I suspect
most people who saw him read noted the uncanny strength of his readings. He
seemed to have a quiet conviction in the power of poetry. And knew his own
power.

Joe Keppler read at Open Space about a year later. Parts of that reading are
at http://vispo.com/audio/index.html#rad . I've read someone say that his
readings in Seattle are "legendary". I understand why they would say that.

I heard Jerome Rothenberg in Seattle at Bumbershoot somewhere around 1990.
The place was packed and it was a big place; this was one of the main
readings at Bumbershoot that year. Rothenberg didn't disappoint. It was a
performance of sound poetry (mostly without words) the likes of which I
haven't heard before or since.

Margareta Waterman read in Victoria in 1995 at Mocambopo. She's one of the
main poets, for me, in Seattle. She read from a work that examines the
alphabet and some of its lore. Fascinating.

Somewhere around 1997 Al Purdy did a reading in Victoria at Mocambopo.
People were jowl to jowl. It was the last time I heard him read. He was
delighted to have such a close crowd, enjoyed himself, and the crowd had a
blast. And he read very well. That was a great evening.

Joe Donahue did a reading in Seattle at the Speakeasy somewhere around 1999.
He reminded me that what I remember, most often, of great poetry readings is
the tone and music, the motion of the spirit of the poet or the poem the two
together indivisible, really, rather than any particular lines. Much like
musical performances when we are moved it is the motion we recall, the
emotion and connection with the song, the motion of the spirit, shared.

Needle points, please,
on all levels: thread,
creative, critical
and a little craziness to boot;
while you are at it, and
in the same State, can you
enlist that detective, Guy (or is it "Goy"?) Noir
to unravel the mysterious death
or was it the Murder of Paul Wellstone?
As you probably know, suspicion
continues to nag many of us.

But above all, Maria, have fun.

Interesting question, what makes a poetry reading stand out.  Of the rea=
dings in New Mexico I've heard, Larry Goodell's have been impressive.  H=
is poems are direct, personal & political, & Larry is a skilled performe=
r, using a number of props & instruments.  He's also funny.  I don't thi=
nk it's simply his skill as a performer that's moving, tho, but the tota=
l package, the investment & experience that he brings to it (40 years no=
w).  =

In a related way, I recorded a reading by Gene Frumkin this year that co=
ntinues to move me.  With Gene, tho, it was straight-forward, just him r=
eading off the page.  But again, he's been at this a long time (since th=
e 50s) & there is a sense of culmination in the work, so when he reads, =
the event is textured by that history.
Lisa Gill & Arthur Sze also have given impressive readings.  I think the=
ir readings were particularly moving because they can involve you intens=
ely in their own levels of engagement, their concerns.

Most print publishers don't care if the work's been online, but a lot
of online publishers do care if it's been on paper.

Part of the reasoning behind my question, and this is
being said to address ruffled feathers, is that print
journals are often a more dependable repository for
work -- being a hard copy and being often found in
libraries and collections. And I certainly had no to
intent to dismiss or pay any disrespect to the advent,
influence, or prominence of the online journal. Too,
my question was asked because both forms, as
representing different media, often reach different
audiences -- and, sometimes, cultivate very different
philosophy with respect to accessibilty (and, one
wonders, if they are in competition). The point, I
wonder, is to see work disseminated, whilst respecting
the author's work, journals, and, of course,
publishers.

Your responses, here, and via back channel, are very
much appreciated.

AJ

Dear Charles, if I might interpret "the last few years" to include the =
l960's (as for poetry they might), I'd mention first Creeley and Wieners =
at the YMHA in New York around l966, introduced by Ed Sanders who =
proclaimed them great "cocksmen" to a liberal and silent crowd. What was =
most telling to me was Wieners pausing in the midst of reading party =
from "Hotel Wentley" to say something close to, "Ever since I heard =
Auden read here I've wanted to, but now I feel some strange monotony =
reading through me." (Not my experience of what he did, which was =
powerfully sad.) Creeley thanked Sanders but proclaimed Ginsberg the =
great cocksman.

Secondly, a reading sponsored by The New York Free Press, a short-lived =
weekly some of whose editors departed to the very green pastures of =
"Screw." About the same period and the Judson Memorial Church(forgive my =
vague chronology). New York Free Press was about the most full-throated =
and competent attack on the political and economic establishment going. =
A reading in honor of LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka who was then in jail in =
Newark after the uprising. The publisher of NYFP, Jack Banning, a =
cigar-chewing tough guy talked about all of "them" out to "get us." =
Armand Schwerner read a poem for his dead brother, and I can still hear =
how beautifully he addressed him. All this despite Baraka's legendary =
anti-Semitism. Jerome Rothenberg reading from Poland ("stuffed with =
Poland") to which he quietly said he'd never been. An evening in which =
it seemed poetry actually could address and change politics, without =
agitprop or liberal sentiment.

All best, Lou

  Interesting question, what makes a poetry reading stand out.  Of the =
readings in New Mexico I've heard, Larry Goodell's have been impressive. =
 His poems are direct, personal & political, & Larry is a skilled =
performer, using a number of props & instruments.  He's also funny.  I =
don't think it's simply his skill as a performer that's moving, tho, but =
the total package, the investment & experience that he brings to it (40 =
years now). =20
  In a related way, I recorded a reading by Gene Frumkin this year that =
continues to move me.  With Gene, tho, it was straight-forward, just him =
reading off the page.  But again, he's been at this a long time (since =
the 50s) & there is a sense of culmination in the work, so when he =
reads, the event is textured by that history.
  Lisa Gill & Arthur Sze also have given impressive readings.  I think =
their readings were particularly moving because they can involve you =
intensely in their own levels of engagement, their concerns.

Charles,
I dislike being read to.

Most "readings" I've attended have bored me to tears.  Let me list a few =
of the major disappointing moments of my listening life:
1. listening to Karl Shapiro read...the man was a poet, teacher, a =
critic, and quite possibly the world's worst reader.  When he stopped =
mumbling and engaged us in conversation, he was witty; that part of the =
evening was delightful.  The reading: Boring.=20
2. listening to Alan Ginsberg pretend to read but preach instead.  The =
man too was a poet, but so wrapped up in himself and his beliefs he =
lacked any sensitivity for his audience; there was a total lack of =
communicative interplay.  The preaching: Boring...the pompous ass =
assumed we all held his ideology.
3. listening to Robert Creeley recite...at this event, Robert held a =
book and flipped pages as he went through the drill of pretending to =
read.  He was in fact reciting his own work from memory, and he did it =
without any apparent connection or concern with or for the 50 or so =
folks seated in front of him.  Television screens had greater =
connectivity with the audience than Robert did that evening. The =
recitation: Boring.=20
4. sitting in a crowded auditorium in Michigan State with another 300 or =
so students at the demands...though referred to as "suggestions"...of =
our Contemporary British Poets prof (who shall remain nameless here) and =
listening to a grad student blunder through the readings of some of W.H. =
Auden's finest material.  The performance: Boring. Although I do =
remember coveting the student's tie...a paisley print as I recall.=20

On the other hand, there's a side to listening to the auditory marvels =
of some poets that makes the event noteworthy, memorable, and special.  =
For example, these are memorable:
1. listening to ted joans between jazz sets.  The man took the floor in =
a darkened room, had a dim light shining up at his face, and he spoke to =
his audience.  He spoke his works as if he were talking with those of us =
who sat in the audience.  There was interplay; there was audience =
tension, and there was poetic communication.  There was no "reading."=20
2. listening to Maya Angelou speak to a crowd of students...the speech =
in and of itself could not too easily be called poetry, but the delivery =
was so moving, so emotionally rich with audience involvement and =
interplay that the entire 30 minutes amounted to an epic poem for my =
memory. The speech: exciting! Again, there was no reading.=20

One closing point, I confess, I never think of poetry as "performance" =
art.  More to the point, I don't view reading as a performance =
skill...just a short-coming in my up-bringing I imagine.=20

 "Poetic Martyrs"


Dear Ray,

I saw your forum about "Poetic Martyrs" and an answer saying that the French
surrealist poet Robert Rius was killed in concentration camp.
It's completely wrong, he was in the Resistance and he was arrested,
tortured and killed in France in July 1944 by the Gestapo network in
Fontainebleau just before the release of Paris.

Australian experiences

Jas H Duke, first in my coffee lounge in 1983 , but most notably at La =
Mama
poetica in a small theatre in Carlton, inner city Melbourne, it held =
about
60 people, a small, intimate venue, with good lighting and sound that =
had
been holding readings since the late 1960s. Jas H Duke performed a set =
of
sound poems and 'sound poem' was one of them. Repeating 'sound poem' =
over
and over again, saying it differently each time, pulling his lips apart =
and
putting his hand inside his mouth to change the sound of the repeated =
sound
poem. The poetry dedicated crowd at La Mama loved it. But so too did a =
large
noisy rock and roll audience at Queensland's Livid Festival in 1990.=20

Ania Walwicz since the early 1980s is another performance poet who has =
been
able to fix me with her performances, engaging me with her short =
staccato
sentences in a mixture of hypotactic and paratactic prose poetry. Her =
polish
accent never obscuring the perfectly enunciated words and passion with =
which
they are delivered.=20
Using not theatrical devices other than standing at the microphone and
delivering her texts.

Jane Fenton Keane whom i first heard in the early 1990s at poetry =
readings
in Brisbane amazed me one day with a performance in a lecture theatre at
Griffith University to first year arts students in 1998. Her 30 minute
memorised rave partly fictional partly autobiographical dramatic =
monologue
had the whole lecture theatre on the edge of their seats. Her high =
energy
performance took everyone by surprise and shocked them into engagement.

In the revolutionary/hippy/peace/love/and happiness early 1970s, and as =
a
long haired university student of science i was blown away by a poet =
called
PiO standing in the Student union surrounded by a circle of people, in =
the
middle of a stampede of students rushing between lectures. I was equally
stunned the first time i saw Tom the Street poet reading his poetry to
passers by in busy bourke street mall in melbourne, handing out his =
street
sheets ably assisted by his girlfriend, Yes Indeed.

I can't forget eric beach's performances. I never knew if he was going =
to
fall over drunk or not. At most readings he'd carry with him every poem =
he'd
ever written, hundreds of single typed sheets of paper in a small =
suitcase,
which probably held other belongings too. He was between homes in the =
early
1980s. Anyway one night at a university reading, i remember a light =
flooded
stage, perhaps it was a literary festival, eric staggered onto stage =
towards
the microphone and trips and all the poems fell out of the suitcase onto =
the
stage. The audience did not know whether to laugh or be concerned for =
his
health, he got up scratched his head and picked up pieces at random from =
the
floor and read them. He was a great success, and he read the poems well, =
and
something tells me he planned it like that. He must have been aware of =
the
fact that that was the image he was creating for himself and he made it =
work
for him, because once he had the attention of the audience he had the =
poems
to maintain their attention.

And White Feather Light at the R J Hawke hotel in brunswick in 1986, =
playing
electronic keyboard with her toes, only the white keys on the keyboard =
was
her plan of action, her poetry was not memorable but her performance =
was. In
the public bar the black ulan bicycle gang drank and liked to heckle on
their way through, and the poetry readings always had a background of =
some
racecall on the tv.

[And in 1991 hearing Sylvia Plath reading Daddy on a vinyl record in the =
ABC
spoken word radio archive studio, very haunting, powerful, chilling, and
dylan thomas reading under milk wood, and ogden nash, and on and on and =
on]

And hearing/experiencing poets like Lauren Williams, Kerry Scuffins, =
Kristin
Henry, Chrissie King, Carmel Bird, Kerry Loughrey and Liz Hall at venues
like caf=E9 jammin' in south melbourne every Tuesday night in the early =
1980s.
Cappucino machine punctuating poets, collaborative works performed
instantly, confessional, beat style poetry, strong women with =
interesting
things to say, presented honestly and with emotion.

Many fond memories and poetic moments at sydney's writers in the park =
from
1985 to the early 1990s. I first heard two australian legends, les =
murray
and john tranter at this venue and they were great performance poets in
terms of knowing how to present their work to audiences, even if they =
were
Australia's most successful published poets. Writers in the park had a
weekly audience of 300 people, and became the literary focal point in =
sydney
for many years. Where writers went every Tuesday night even if they =
didn't
listen to the readings and an open section for unpublished and unknown
writers. It really helped to bring literature to the public sphere, =
along
with Mietta's/Readings bookshop readings in melbourne and Talk it Down
readings in brisbane.


Enough for now
Charles what have you started here
There'll be an avalanche of 'reading'/sounding experiences at ubpoetics.

As a print publisher I'm uninterested in printing material that has appeared
anywhere else. The whole point for me is to expose the audience to stuff that's
never been seen before. Based on my subscriber list I suspect that a lot of
CARVE's present audience is also pretty up-to-date on what's going on in the
webzines; thus I don't want to be redundant.

When one of my California friends got involved in getting archaic anti-sex
laws off the books, I doubt she was concerned with or thinking of women in
prison.  She might have gone to jail herself at one time -- for reasons other than
sex -- but didn't end up having it go that way, thank goodness for her.  On
Martin Luther King Jr. holiday in 2003 (three years ago), I went to jail for
having drunk 5.5 beers on election night Nov. 5, 2002.  I drove home that night
well enough, but I was stopped because one of my high beams was out for a
quarter mile.  The other headlights worked fine, but my bal (blood alcohol level)
turned out after three weeks of urine testing to be .12 or .02 over the legal
limit.  Besides the alcohol, they tested for the anti-depressants I told them
they would find -- two of them -- plus lithium and an an anti-seizure drug.  I
was in treatment for major as well as manic depression.  According to the
doctor, three drinks with food is all right, but I had drunk 5.5 beers with just
an appetizer.  The charge against me was gross misdemeanor, which is likely to
cause problems in finding employment, likely for good.

The jail, where I stayed for 48 hours, gave me enough information to write a
180-page book, something I resisted setting out upon due to the insult of it.
The other women in the jail were staying longer than I was -- I had ankle
bracelet to contend with after leaving the jail; they were in jail, no longer in
apartments, and without a way to be on ankle bracelet at home.  Martha Stewart
said she preferred jail to ankle bracelet, but I preferred ankle bracelet.
The ankle bracelet itself was like a plastic wrist watch that someone had
cleverly clamped on above my foot, so my shoes could tell time.  There was a box
that looked like Darth Vader's helmet plugged in by my new phone line that would
send out a red signal if I should try to leave.  I never ended up leaving the
house in 18 days, so I was set free ten days early.  I could bathe and
otherwise move about.  I wore a sock under the bracelet to keep it from chafing.

Those 18 days gave me much less to think or worry about than the 48 hours in
jail.  I read two books while in jail, one was by Zora Neale Hurston about her
visits to Haiti and Jamaica.  She gives an amazing account of a wild bore
hunt.  If you get a chance to read hers next to Robert Stone's description of
being in Mexico with Kesey and Kerouac and THEIR wild boar, do that.  The food in
jail was dreadful, so it was the next best thing to eating something really
good to read of eating the boar with Zora.  (The chicken ala king, however, was
good, and so were the biscuits.)

It's sick that I could write a good long account of those 48 hours; I guess
we'd agree to that.  Two years later it was still bothering me that the women
in the jail were not allowed lotion unless someone they knew brought it to the
m.  There was an epidemic of dry skin there, so dry that the women had visibly
sore skin.  This is not going to help their chances in finding work and
housing when they get out, and yet it is such a simple thing.  I wanted to organize
something, but I never go to bars -- it would be a wonderful thing for women
who do go to bars to try to do -- sponsor a woman in jail with a bottle of
lotion by bringing it to her.

The black women were in jail for crack & prostitution (except one who had hit
someone while she was pregnant) and the white women were there for drinking &
driving.  I had a one-year sentence hanging over my head.  Jail is a really
bad place by comparison to being locked in your own house.  I hope it never has
to happen again.  It's sad that I have become such a recluse.  I prevent ever
having to go to jail again by rarely leaving my own house, and by rarely
drinking -- by living in fear of authorities and of local busybodies.  With money,
I would move to a decent city and out of the suburbs.  Jobs are mostly out of
the question due to the record.

My California friend who was agitating for anti-sex laws off the books for
gay men in Houston didn't think of this:  How do the police KNOW that the women
are trading sex for drugs before they are arrested?  Why aren't they simply
arrested for possessing drugs?

Had I had sex prior to my arrest?  Had they thought I had?  I was carrying
expired condoms in my car (how embarrassing!) -- and they did rip through the
car later and throw everything around.  My head was wrapped in a large black
muffler with a Harley Davidson patch on one end -- the woman cop must have
thought I was a Muslim in the dark of night, in my dented blue Volvo 240 DL 1989 the
way she looked at the flipped-over patch.  I had voted for Democrats.

Perhaps I'm being too aloud, here, but I'm wondering
if some of us're really just writing for the few, let
me say, and this is being prompted by some of the less
then friendly responses sent me directly, almost as if
the point's to be parochial or exclusive, a weakness
one might easily argue, rather than accessible to a
broader audience and open, as O'hara might've said,
the shame in this being, of course, that such
highbrowed thinking has led our community to the kind
of political and cultural impotence in which we find
polluting us these days. This I'm a publisher bit,
sounds really bitchy, and that threatening --
"Well...well..." (Well, for instance, I understand
you've got something at stake, I mean, you're like a
promoter, one could say, of your own aesthetic, and
perhaps need to legitimize it -- along with yourself).


I'll be Stateside soon and hope to hear many of you

Tired, am tired, he said. So, please, forgive all the
grammar mistakes and spelling errors, as I think the
point's clear (and it's almost midnight Beijing time).

a little less then a year after boog started i was visiting ed sanders to
look through his d.a. levy archives. i asked him for a poem i had heard him
read, and he said that it had already been published in another journal. so
i asked him if he had anything unpublished i could get instead. he told me
to wait a second, that that previously published piece was only out in a
journal with a print run of 300 and that the piece had more life left in it,
adding that we didn't really have a crossover with them either.

so basically that's been my policy for the past 13+ years.

best,
david

Today would have been Laura (Riding) Jackson's 105th birthday,
so I just thought I'd share some of these journal thought/questions I wrote
after my little truncated dialogue with Dave Baratier and Charles Bernstein
on this list last week
(the first paragraph refers, briefly, to two other threads from this list a
few weeks back.....)

Chris

Do you want to wage war over the meaning of the word =B3poetry=B2 with the
editors of the Chicago magazine =B3Poetry: A Magazine of Verse=B2? Or the
curators of the Chicago alternative shindig, from poetry to verse? Or with
Charles Bernstein for that matter
who considers =B3poetry=B2 as a defendant and a writer like Laura (Riding)
Jackson a
=B3witness for the prosecution?=B2

Does it seem that Bernstein, in claiming to side with =B3poetry,=B2
characterized as the defendant, is a witness for those who are prosecuting =
a
case against Laura (Riding) Jackson in the name of =B3poetry=B2? And what is
this =B3poetry=B2 for which he speaks?
Is it YOUR poetry? (and if it's not, is he, along with the Chicago
poetry/verse folks, prosecuting a case against YOU?)

And if it is, does it need to be so spoken for, defended? Can it be DEFINED=
?
(and what is the relationship between defining and defending?)

Does Shelley=B9s or Sidney=B9s famous defenses defend it?
Does Whitman=B9s anonymously printed self-reviews defend it?
Does Baraka=B9s =B3Hunting Is Not Those Heads On The Wall=B2?
Do Riding=B9s statements that criticize the limits imposed on what was called
poetry by many in her day (from the 1920s up until her death in 1991),
whether =B3modernist=B2 or not,
define it? Is there a wall separating freedom from poetry?

Do you think verse is much easier to define (if not necessarily to defend)
than poetry?  And, if so, is poetry only valuable as verse?

To what extent is freedom disparaged by what=B9s called poetry?
It=B9s clearer for the formalists, but for those who claim NOT to be
formalists, or who engage in a more moderate formalism (allowing a modicum
of freedom in the form of
=B3hybrid texts=B2 etc), to what extent is =B3ask not what poetry can do for=8Bor
as=8Byou,
but ask what you can do for poetry=B2 a statement you agree with?

Then there=B9s quotes like these =B3but if you=B9re gonna call people like Robert
Frost a poet, then I got to say this gas station boy was too=B2 (taken out of
context from a 1965 Bob Dylan press-conference interview) around which a
really interesting essay could be written.

NOW, HOLD IT, Here I am imagining like I got some kind of public
forum---this Buffpo list! I don=B9t. Bernstein briefly came down here to
debate a little, then quietly left me with the last word, and a (temporary)
feeling of inconsequence, of =B3squandered energy=B2 insofar as poetry is a
social medium. But I guess that=B9s okay if I have no reputation to defend.
And even if I did, any defense would have no meaning unless it was also a
creating in its own right, whether or not such creation is called poetry, o=
r
=B3glorified=B2 with the fetishised term poetry.

To =B3break the spell of poetry=B2 is to de-fetishize the term whose shackles
may be aesthetically shiny, or even gloriously grimy, but insofar as poetry
is a non-pejorative term employed or deployed to designate a writing
activity, to what extent is a defense of it necessary?

If it can=B9t be defined (even as =B3that which can=B9t be defined=B2), at least in
any absolute way,
that doesn=B9t mean it can=B9t be defended. But if you choose to defend poetry,
especially if you=B9re defending it as =B3that which can=B9t be defined,=B2 what ar=
e
you defending it against?
And can whatever you=B9re defending really be called poetry? Or, you=B9re going
to claim
=B3REVOLUTION=B2 and offer more of the same dressed in shiny new snake oil
vocabulary or syntax, are you ay better or worse than those who don=B9t claim
to be revolutionary?

Chris

I haven't read in public for almost six years.

The last reading I attended (accompanied by Jessica Grim) was by Robert
Creeley, a couple of years ago, at Kent State. Creeley's reading was memorable. As
was our brief exchange afterwards.

This occasion was also the last time I saw legendary book dealer James Lowell
alive.  James was pissed that I hadn't been by to see him for quite awhile.
Sigh.

  UBUWEB :: Winter 2006
----------------------------

--- RECENT FEATURES ---

Samuel Beckett: BBC Radio Plays Eight full-length BBC radio productions of Samuel Beckett
plays, broadcast between 1959 and 1991. Audio includes: Molloy, Malone Dies, The
Unnamable (Ireland, 1958); A Piece of Monologue (UK, 1986); Cascando (UK, 1964); Cascando
(Ireland, 1991); Embers (UK, 1959); Rough for Radio (UK, 1976); Words and Music (UK,
1962); The Old Tune (Ireland).

Jacques Lacan: Hours of archival material from French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan
(1901-1981). Includes his 1973 film TÃ©lÃ©vision (1973), the complete Radiophonie (1970),
as well as numerous other lectures dating from 1966-1970. Also included are nine audio
recordings of the legendary SÃ©minaire. From 1953 to 1980, Lacan's SÃ©minaire was the
laboratory, the work-in -progress for his Return to Freud project. The SÃ©minaire was a
singular place and moment, almost weekly, every year from November to June. Without any
connection with university, it was public and open to everyone. Curiously, despite
Lacan's famous verve for grandiloquence and his matchless improvising oral style, none of
the 500 sessions have been cleanly and officially recorded (neither audio nor video)
until now, presented here on UbuWeb. (audio and video is in French)

Harold Pinter: BBC Radio Plays 8 hours worth of plays by Harold Pinter aired between
1964-2000. Includes "Moonlight" (2000), "A Slight Ache" (2000), "Last To Go" (1964), "The
Birthday Party" (1970), "No Man's Land" (1978), "Betrayl" (1990), "Family Voices" (date
unknown), "Landscape", "Victoria Station" (1986) and "Family Voices" (1981).

Gertrude Stein: MP3s In conjunction with our partners at PennSound, UbuWeb is pleased to
host a number of audio recordings by Gertrude Stein made during the years of 1934-1935
with liner notes by Stein scholar Ulla Dydo. Selections include: "The Making of
Americans: Parts 1 & 2", "Matisse", "A Valentine to Sherwood Anderson", "If I Told Him: A
Completed Portrait of Picasso", "Portrait of Christian BÃ©rard", "Madame Recamier: An
Opera", "How She Bowed To Her Brother" and "Interview (1934)."

Okay, I'll jump into this one a little....
(though I have way too many thoughts to adequately represent here)

While I don't entirely agree with Alex Saliby
(for instance, I've always found Creeley to be an excellent performer
if not exactly "reader"),
like Alex (and many others I've talked to),
I do generally tend to find about 90% of poetry readings I've attended
to be pretty boring.

(however since I go to less now than I used to---
which of course means I don't get asked to read as much as I used to--
that percentage has decreased---maybe only about 60% I now find boring)

Yet, the conclusion that I draw from this, for me, existential fact,
is not that poetry IS NOT a performance art.

Rather, I take it as a challenge--

If, for instance, one likes, loves, even NEEDS, poetry on the page,
the intensities that occur in reading and writing in "a room of one's own"
(or at least a cafe),
what is the purpose of a poetry reading of this kind of work that,
on paper and in solitude, can seem very liberating or vivifying?

I think it is, for the most part, an under-explored question.
Or that there's an etiquette/protocol based on the assumption
that somehow reading from what essentially amounts to a
"PREPARED SPEECH" in a gallery, bar, etc.,
whether seated at a desk or standing,
in a church-like quiet, with the occasional chuckle perhaps,
is going to somehow come close to evoking what the book does.

Or that anybody who would even hope or expect that the performance
would do anything like this is, frankly, unrealistic.
The assumptions that the "reading" is somehow secondary to
1) the after reading party and 2) the book you're then suppossed to take
home
color most readings with a "life is elsewhere" feeling.

It's one of the reasons that in my own readings (starting from around 1998)
I began to READ less and less of my poetry, and IMPROVISE far more--
going around the room, asking questions, inviting heckling, needling the
audience, changing tones, using stand-up comedy, dialogue pieces, perhaps
even playing a song (if there's a piano) and THEN after clearing
away alot of the GUCK, that detritus, "breaking down the fourth wall,"
reading a SERIOUS poem VERY VERY slowly---just one or two perhaps--
but in general I've found I've REACHED more people and more profoundly
this way---
Sure, some of these experiments have been more successful than others.
That's the risk of such performances, but even though I've had some
"purists" object to what I'm doing, or who say "I'm selling my self short"
perhaps (on the ground that they think it's making a mockery of my work
or something), I still feel it's worth it, and comes closer to the
sense of intimate confrontation I find in my favorite writing on the page.

For if people want to READ THE POETRY ON THE PAGE, which, yes, sure, I'd
like them to do, well, they can always see the linguistic subtleties THERE--
I don't ALWAYS need to try to replicate that in performance.
Sometimes I'll still do the "Straight" reading
(or at least my version of the straight reading)
but even in the best of those I've attended as an audience
there's this sense of A WASH OF WORDS that can drown or floor---
(and the linguistic subtleties don't come through no matter how drab a
monotone
one reads in---therefore why not have some fun with it?)

One way to cope with this (as audience member) is to take notes,
or to stand near the back of the room and allow oneself to sway--

Yet if, say, three people are reading, and there was a GREAT LINE
by poet # one that really blew you away, by the time the event is over
it's sometimes very hard to remember just what that was---

I'd really love it if more poets and venue-curators considered
re-evaluating the standard poetry reading format.

I've curated some readings where I only let a poet read for like 5 minutes
and then let people in the audience interact with that poet,
and then move on. That's one possible way. Many others....

Then of course there's the big problem that for the most part only poets
go to alot of these readings, and the way this changes the performance
itself.

Luckily, there's some exceptions---

Last night, I happened to go to a performance hosted by East Bay writer Kaya
Oakes, who wrote an essay a few years ago called "Why Poetry Readings Suck,"
and who I'm told will shortly be publishing her first book of poetry on
Dave Baratier's PAVEMENT SAW Press (which, for the sake of full disclosure,
published my first book, 11 years ago). It was a lot of "personal essays,"
"cultural criticism" kind of stuff combined with poetry---and it worked very
well as a combination of informal and formal. Particularly the reading by
Stefanie Kalem and poet Jeff Johnson---both spoke directly to an audience,
in a non-specialized way, and when Jeff read two linguistically
sophisticated poems in between his two informal stories, even if they
might have "gone over the head" of some of the audience, they had an
emotional impact that the framing devices helped bring forth, and showed
that, yes, there can be a place for what might be called poetry, outside
the "self-satisfied" (but secretly frustrated) inwardly oriented pseudo-
consensus of the sub-sub-coteries.

actually, i think everything chris says here goes for mla "readings"
too, with the necessary adjustments... in general i think our
approach to public space as
writers/readers/thinkers/creators/performers/jugglers/butchers/bakers
and candlestick makers could use some serious retooling... why do
people want to hear other people speak?... why do they want to gather
together with other people and hear three different people speak,
uninterruptedly, for 20 minutes apiece (whether poetry or
scholarship)?... listening to vocal work/performance, finally, sans
song as such (if you'll permit me to make this distinction, just so's
we have something to discuss), isn't high on my list of things in
life i eagerly anticipate, uh-uh...

i'm always happy, for that matter, when i *do* hear something worth hearing...

i'm sure, too, that my response isn't shared by everyone, if only b/c
i always find people at absolutely dreadful readings---dreadful in
terms as objective as i can imagine them---to be moved to tears
(etc.)... which means not simply that we have different aesthetics,
but that we've been differently sensitized to speech/language
practices... i mean, not simply cognitively, if that too, but bodily,
and interpersonally... to move me to tears or to make me laugh, hard,
or to get me to thinking---to do that by speaking... words?...

that shouldn't be so easy, should it?... but yeah, i'm of the opine
that one of the major mistakes made by poets is thinking they can and
should be rendering the page verbatim, as it were, during a
reading---and more, that that's all they should be doing... this
works sometimes, but in my experience, not most of the time...

best,

joe

oh well, i find i have to post an addendum to what i just posted:

probably the WORST thing a poet can do is spend needless minutes
(upon minutes) in between each and every fucking poem explaining to
the audience what it's about, where it comes from, etc... *that* kind
of interjection---where the spiel often lasts longer than the actual
reading of the poem---is high on my Not To Do list...

the banter, that is, however improvisational, really has to be a
practiced thing...

best,

joe

i think there is a difference that is defined by the individual
that is, do they focus on the page as a static object
if so, they probably shouldn't read as presenting the text (orally) is not
their focus
(and now the conjecture)
i really enjoy reading robert lax's work, but i would never want to hear th=
e
poems he dedicated to ad reinhardt
red
red
red
etc
same with, eg, eugen gomringer
however, if the page is something that is a mere container--the energy of
the words in capusle form--then by all means go
this list would include
mike basinski
jackson maclow
etcetera

most poets, however, are somewhere in-between and that is when you have no
idea what the fuck yer gonna get

that said, probably nothing was said, and i have to go back to work

Dear Patricia Spears Jones,

My favourite Shelley Winters film was 'The Balcony' -
the screen version of Jean genet's play in the
'sixties.
She played the madam of the fantasy house where the
clients act out their erotic fantasies. She was great.
I liked her as Roseanne's mum too.

All good wishes,
Pam

Three memorable readings.

Amiri Baraka a couple of Dodge Festivals ago.  He was on the main stage,
but given an afternoon slot, and he really whipped it up--including some
hand percussion on the podium if I recall correctly.

I saw Ginsberg many times but the best I ever heard him do was at Albany,
NY's now defunct QE2 back in the early 90's.  He'd already read at the
University; this was the community read, and the black-walled club must
have inspired him-- "The Green Car" and "Please, Master" in the same
reading.  Outstanding.

To my taste a lot of efforts to do poetry with music just don't work
because they're either cliched or just thrown together affairs, but a
couple of years ago Joy Harjo did a reading here in Chicago sponsored by
the Guild Complex that was exquisite.  She had her sax, a bass man and a
guy on cajon and other hand percussion.  In this case, the music supported
the poetry and extended the poems' impact.  Even the rows of bells
strapped to her ankles were completely appropriate and effective.

Oh yeah, Amiri Baraka! I forgot that I saw him, but now that you
mention it, his readings are definitely memorable. I saw Amiri Baraka
at this tiny little space in Detroit 6 or 7 years ago and the room was
packed and he's pretty short so I couldn't see him. It was so hot and
I was trying to stand on my tippy toes the whole time. One thing I
remember him saying was something like: why do you think they call the
white house the white house? And it sent the whole room into a roar.

I'll never forget that!

Environment in crisis: 'We are past the point of no return'
Thirty years ago, the scientist James Lovelock worked out that the Earth
possessed a planetary-scale control system which kept the environment fit
for life. He called it Gaia, and the theory has become widely accepted. Now,
he believes mankind's abuse of the environment is making that mechanism work
against us. His astonishing conclusion - that climate change is already
insoluble, and life on Earth will never be the same again.

Re intros to poems

New zealand's sam hunt spends a long time introducing poems, but his =
intros
are stand up comedy routines that do not detract from the poem but frame
them and i have seen him perform them to literary festival audiences at =
the
brisbane writers festival and in a noisy pub in roselle in sydney. His =
hour
and a half show was well received in both venues.
But i agree with joe, those who reveal the content of the poems before =
they
read them, or who have to explain too many references in the poem have =
not
chosen their poems wisely for public performance. There are those who
haven't decided what poems they will read before getting onto the stage =
and
waste people's time fumbling about.

Re: skills for performance

Those who think there are no skills required for performance have =
probably
never successfully communicated their poetry in public. If someone gets =
up
to read a poem and read it like they were sitting in their lounge at =
home
reading it from a book, head buried in the book, to me this is not =
public
performance, it is personal indulgence, there is no consideration of the
audience. To have an audience in a pub venue, 300 people who have been
drinking, absolutely silent, as you whisper a poem, takes sophisticated
performance skills not just powerful words on a page.

Eye contact:
I think once you get over nerves and can actually look at the audience
instead of looking at your shoes and stop using the book or sheet of =
paper
to hide behind, then you start to communicate, when you can establish =
eye
contact with your audience you can read their reaction and a feedback =
loop
starts to happen.

I have heard Baraka read in San Francisco, Buffalo, Boston and Victoria.
At the Victoria reading, it was a Sun Splash weekend, run by Hope
Anderson,
and some kids had been dozing out in the sun, listening to Taj Mahal.
Then
Amiri Baraka started READING. and boy, did they snap awake!

I saw that reading too. That was back in the early eighties. I remember how
smart he looked. And he had his poems in a briefcase. A perfectly serious
poet. No question about it. And when he read, the righteous scolding began.
It wasn't so much anger with a cause--though of course there was cause (and
some anger)--as the truly funky justicer had obviously come to town. Yes, I
agree--that was indeed a memorable reading.

Hope Anderson gave white bread Victoria a gift in that Sun Fest with Baraka
and Taj Mahal that was unexpected, to me, and really something. I was pretty
young at the time. Hope had his 'Octopus Island Bookstore' in Market Square.
The store specialized in northwest poetry. It lasted a couple of years. That
was the best bookstore Victoria's had, as far as I'm concerned--the only one
with that sort of purpose. Of course it was doomed. I suspect Hope new that.
But he did something beautiful there. That was the house of poetry.

I'll always remember bill bisset doing his 'Opening Chant' or something
similar opening a reading at a toronto space. i was just a front-row kid
and remember thinking he was a bearded rhythmic lunatic, i was at the
wrong place, and when were the real poets coming out? But coming out i
was happy to forget everything after that (for shame that anything
should follow)

Dear Charles:

Curiously enough, two of the most memorable poetry readings I ever =20
attended
had the poets sitting at a table, nearly immobile--but with very good =20=

mics and sound systems.
As non-purist as this may sound, a good sound system has always
enhanced my experience of the poetry reading because it allowed the poet
to focus his/her energy on nuance of voice and not spend half of his/=20
her energy
on projecting so that the back row can merely make out what's being =20
said.

The poets were Robert Duncan and Octavio Paz in Madrid and Berkeley, =20
respectively.
It may very well have been--in fact, I'm certain it was--Duncan's =20
last reading.
It would have been around 1985/6 in the Maude Fife Room on the third =20
floor
of Wheeler Hall  on the Berkeley campus. Up until that point, I had =20
only read him
(I was introduced to his work by Thom Gunn, a former teacher). I had =20
no expectation
of how the Duncan reading would go (I'd had my share of famous poets
reading horribly). As I recall, what I enjoyed was how playful he =20
was, the richness
of the voice, the bantering between the poems, which was nearly as =20
enriching--
and then almost without warning he would launch into a voice performance
(his illness, I suppose, did not allow for any sweeping arm gestures, =20=

which I hear
he did in his younger days---just the voice) of one of his poems, the =20=

most memorable
--not surprisingly--My Mother would be a Falconress". The recitation =20
by Duncan of that
poem remains one of the high points of my experience with poetry.

The Octavio Paz reading took place in the early 90s before he won the =20=

Nobel.
He read at the renowed "Residencia de Estudiantes" where Lorca, Dali,
and Bunel lived during their college years. Unlike with my experience =20=

with
Duncan, whose work I was already an admirer of on the page, I had
little experience with Paz's. But it was a great reading. Again, =20
there was
an intangible quality in the voice and what he did with it. I know =20
I'm doing
a terrible job of rendering the experience. And he read this wonderful
poem called "The Fable of Joan Mir=F3". Towards the end, he read a =
series
of brief love poems, and I remember closing my eyes and just drinking
in the voice. I was sitting quite in the back and didn't have a good =20
view
of him to begin with, but it remains one of the best experiences at a =20=

poetry
reading. It was his voice---subdued, amplified just right, and clear. =20=

His voice.
What he did with it.

hi all,

following shanna compton's lead in scanning and putting joan murray's
poems (yale UP 1947) online, and with ca conrad's encouragement that i
go public with it, i've made The Grasshopper's Man and other poems by
Rosalie Moore (Yale UP 1949) available as a PDF (2.2M) online. you can
reach the link via

http://heuriskein.blogspot.com/2006/01/grasshoppers-man-and-other-poems-by.html

rosalie moore brown was originally associated with the activist group of
poets who studied in the berkeley area under lawrence hart in the 1940s,
including jeanne mcgahey, robert horan, robert barlow and others.
moore's 1949 debut was chosen by w.h. auden for the yale younger poet's
series. moore's next book did not appear until the 1970s, during which
time she raised a family and wrote children's books with her husband.
she also wrote and published long poems on gutenberg and the childrens'
crusade. she died in the mid-1990s.

enjoy!

ANNOUNCING "When I Met You" A new CD of songs arranged and performed by Elya
Finn with lyrics by poet Michael Rothenberg. Check it out at CDBABY.COM:
http://cdbaby.com/cd/elyafinn2

"Elya's CD is fabulous -- all her songs sound like Weimar Lenya & postwar
Nico, lushly affirmative at the same time being edged w/ cosmic
weltschmertz. An immensely tasty production." --David Meltzer

"A perfect and balanced vehicle for poet Michael Rothenberg and singer and
composer Elya Finn. Congratulations to them both for this terrific CD!"
--Joanne Kyger

"Thrilling this CD. Brecht/Weill of course come to mind, but also the
wonderful cabaret songs of Arnold Weinstein & Bill Bolcom on BLACK
MAX." --Bill Berkson

"This album features soft rock with overtones of jazz and Kurt Weill.
Michael Rothenberg's lyrics are the most intelligent lyrics I've heard in
years. Elya Finn, a skilled and sensitive vocalist, renders them with
tenderness and passion. Highly recommended!" --Vernon Frazer

"Lovely dark, smoky and shadowy jazzy female pop that creeps and slithers,
wrapping itself around rich piano harmonies, shuffley drums and a noir-ish
strut. Drumming up mischief and mystery wherever she can, Elya Finn gives up
her breathy alto voice to these songs of intrigue and hidden agendas. Jazz
meets noir, folk meets pop, dark cabaret meets whispering lullabies. A
beautifully mysterious album." --CD BABY

Yeah. Google and Yahoo. Eventually to include others such as Altavista and
maybe Flickr. They all come up with different images when you search a given
concept or phrase, though there's overlap.

The thing can go in several directions from here.

Can be a screensaver; you'd configure it, say, to read your browsing history
and it'd search for images relevant to that language; or you'd configure it,
say, to read your email and it'd pick out key words and feed that into
dbcinema; or you configure words yourself it uses as search language.

Could also be part of an installation piece in a gallery or wherever. A room
for a couple of people to converse in. Two chairs. A table. The chairs are
miked. The audio gets fed into a voice recognition system. The voice
recognition system recognizes the odd word and feeds that into dbcinema.
dbcinema is projected onto the wall. So the people see images sometimes
relevant to their conversation. Or they use dbcinema in their conversation.
'Yeah, show us Istanbul. I said Istanbul. Istanbul for gawds sake. Damn
thing.'

Or could use parts of the code in works such as
http://vispo.com/vismu/warpigs/warpigs8.htm (which isn't finished either)
for the visuals. In this case, I'd feed dbcinema warpig-related language
every now and then as the audio plays.

Currently it's dbslideshow. But I'd eventually like to take it to dbcinema
via stuff like the algorithms at http://complexification.net . There you see
some pretty nice abstract generative visual work. The idea would be to use
such algorithms but have them operate on the visuals fetched by dbcinema.
Usually computer generated visuals are strong (when they're strong)
concerning abstraction. Not too hot concerning representation. But this
poses the possib of combining good generative abstract visuals with somewhat
relevant representation.

Probably more than you wanted to know.

Neo-Benshi Night: Move Over Silver Screen

With Mistress of Ceremonies Roxi Power Hamilton

Presented in association with SF Cinematheque & curated by Konrad Steiner &
Stephanie Young. Neo-benshi is the result of the dalliance between poets and
moving pictures from which is born a new breed of entertainment. Restoring
cinema to the theater and casting the movies away from their original dialog,
nine writers re-adapt films to their own intent. Subtext and potentials are
revealed in the performances to scenes from the following features (all titles
are anagrams to protect the guilty).

"Fall Down & Bounce" (1972) A well-loved fire and slice samurai adventure
adapted from a well-known japanese manga. benshi: Leslie Scalapino

"No to Torture Inflicted" (1939) Romantic comedy sparring Edgar Bergen,
Charlie McCarthy and Eve Arden. benshi: Alan Bernheimer

"My High: The Death Thing" (1954) A transpacific flight of both colorful and
renegade passengers. benshis: Dodie Bellamy, Colter Jacobsen & Kevin Killian

"Ahem, Conspiracy!" (2000) Macabre tale of a crazy criminal investment banker.
benshi: Ronald Palmer

"It's Sweet & So Dry" (1961) A celebration in dance and song of tense race
relations. benshi: Dennis Somera

"An Horseman's Option" (1952) A strong woman cornered in the seedy English
countryside. benshi: Tanya Brolaski

"By Bob" (1973) From Bollywood, the sweet agony of love bridging the castes.
benshi: Summi Kaipa

Catherine Wagner about this time last year in the New Brutalism Series at
the 2nd oldest space of 21 Grand in Oakland....reading and singing her poems
in a somewhat flat but utterly heartfelt way....

Mark McMorris in fall 2004 at Small Press Traffic....what a voice, what a
presence.....

both of these writers were majestic and humble and perfectly in pitch with
the idionsyncratics of their own poetics in a way that was extremely
pleasing to me. They made me happy.

At last week's Poets Theater Jamboree Mattilda aka Matt Bernstein Sycamore
and crew did an amazing song dance and play called Who is the Real
JTLeroy....they were hilarious, gorgeous, and very fine dancers. A standing
ovation, perhaps Poets Theater's first.

Back to lurking, Elizabeth

Interesting to read your post, Chris. I am very much of the less is more, in
terms of contextualizing the work at readings....I don't want to talk too
much about my own poems, and I certainly don't want to hear to much about
others', generally speaking. I realize this is not responding precisely to
your comments, but what I like is when the voice lends something to the
words, some new dimension I didn't get when reading. This happened to me
with Brenda Coultas, as one example that comes to mind. This is what I look
for at poetry readings; I like the bellowing church voices I suppose.

Cheers and really back to lurking, Elizabeth

Sorry, Komninos; there is no facility for 'unregistering' as a minor.
Perhaps I will add some code that checks your age once a year. I'm not sure.

The value, I feel, of dbcinema in its current incarnation (and this is true
whether the porn filter is on or off) is as a tool (not really a work of
art) with which to explore the collective visual representation of ideas,
places, history and people, mainly. The further away the language you use is
from products and consumerism, the more interesting the search results. I
learned quite a bit in a search of 'ontology' concerning contemporary usage
of that word. Lots of tree diagrams detailing particular 'ontologies'. In a
different vein, I've been reading works by Turkish writers
recently--including Murat's anthology of Turkish poetry, which I
recommend--and so searched for various places in and writers from Turkey and
got wonderful results. You may have noted that if you click an image, that
opens the Web page on which the image was found. That lets you broaden it
from a solely visual thing into the textual as well.

It's a different way of looking at how to search. Often, when we are looking
for information, we just use regular google (or whatever) text search. And
that has its advantages. But if we are either looking for visual information
or we are prepared to approach the search in a more leisurely, possibly
disinterested manner, then the visual approach can be rewarding and
pleasantly surprising. The sites we visit tend to be ones that contain
interesting graphical representations of whatever we're searching for. That
doesn't always mean their textual content is going to be better than others,
but if their graphical content stands out, it's likely that the intelligence
behind the site may have additional insight to offer besides what we see in
dbcinema.

I've been meaning to get that age verification in there for a while, and now
it's in; i'd say it's in there for good. So, sorry, no, there's not a
version online that doesn't have the age verification in it.

CARVE is pleased to announce the publication of the first two chapbooks in the
CARVE Editions series: Jess Mynes’ birds for example and Christopher Rizzo’s
Zing.

In birds for example Jess Mynes creates a rural vernacular reminiscent at times
of Clark Coolidge, Philip Whalen, and Joseph Ceravolo. Flora and frustration,
seasonal changes, sea changes - all are present in these poems which, though
comfortable in their abstraction, find rather than lose the reader.

Christopher Rizzo’s ZING will stand as a document of a certain kind of
existence long after its author has left it behind. With a sense of line, break
and word reminiscent of a Renaissance-era Coolidge, Rizzo deftly drops these
lyrics of longing and beauty. The title is apt.

Each book is $5, available (shortly) via this website or via post:

CARVE Poems

1. I first heard Ginsberg read as one of a number of poets in an
anti-war reading at Penn circa 1966, he's the only one I remember well.
He read
a lengthy section of Wichita Vortex Sutra, which was as yet unpublished.
I was not prepared for poetry as politically powerful as this, and so
fully
of its moment in history. Although the distance of time has diminished
it somewhat, the memory of  hearing it stays with me sustaining my
continuing respect for it.
=20
2. For me Creeley is one of the great poetry readers. Initially, this is
in 1975 in the Auckland Grammar School Hall, and he was reading with two
others, both
New Zealanders, one older (my father)  and one much younger but both of
them read far more formally than Creeley. Auckland Grammar is the
nearest thing in the state system to a private high school, and with
that went a degree of pompous solemnity. While the others stood and used
the lecturn, Creeley sat
on a stool and smoked. There was something liberated in his American
casualness. But what was more to the point was the manner in which
Creeley made this school hall  an intimate space,  reduced its size and
our numbers so that both were drawn into a small circle around him.=20
=20
3. A year or so ago at the Poetry Project at St Marks I heard Harryette
Mullen for the first time. Apart from her reading which I liked a lot,
the evening was memorable as being the first time I had registered that
there were members of the audience writing.  Several, and two at least
were poets, whom I knew would not be taking notes. What were they
writing?  I remember some time before going to a Dinosaur Junior concert
in Buffalo with a couple of poets who were writing away on the fringes
of the mosh pit. Are these random events, or is there a significant
dimension to the contemporary reading that has been overlooked here?
What is the meaning of this listening? =20

I'll add Ginsberg at the University of Arkansas in the late 70s, a reading he
dedicated to the memory of Frank Stanford.

Good question.  I suggest Writing in & during a reading may:
1. Just be a mark of respect - similar to humming along to music (a kind of
participatory way of being there.) (A way of sharing the pleasure - taking
down words, phrases one likes.)
Or
2. An act of improvisation - listening to a poet's lines and building on
and/or transforming them into something of your own. (At least something to
take home and possibly build on). Theory of another's poems as a catalyst
for other poems, yours, etc.
Or,
3. An act of nervousness - the way some folks to needlework no matter what
the occasion.
Or,
4. The way some poets need to balance their power against or with the power
of the poet reading. A kind of counter-ego absorption.
Or,
5. Similar to the way some write notes in the margins of a book - a means of
interpretation, critical or otherwise.

I suspect for some poets and audience members it's aggravating - the way an
8th grader teacher gets aggravated when students are writing and passing
notes back and forth in class. Not something you are supposed to do in
Church.

I actually never do take notes during a reading - it gets in the way of
being fully open and taking it all in. Of course, if it's a bad reading, I'd
rather 'vote with my feet.' But don't. Just fight falling asleep!

My poem in this -- there was some discussion when I wrote it about the best
place to put something like this -- I don't know because it is about Canada
but written by an American, or it was back when there were no poems on the
list and people weren't sure about posting poems to blogs...

Anyway, I decided the best place for the poem was in an online journal with
a theme the poem fit into.

All best,
Catherine

		More Fun With 'Pataphysics (Poetic
		Experiments for Ages Zero to Ethernity)
			by Sharon Harris (Toronto)



7.  Poets who lose their way

Why do poets fly to the warm lights of pubs and bars?  They are not
naturally attracted to these places, but misled.  Flying at night, poets
steer by the moon.  They know they are flying in a straight line as long
as the moon shines into their eyes from the same side.  But when they pass
the lights of a public house (on the other side), they get confused.  They
leave their straight flight path and approach in spirals.

You aren't the only adult who has emailed me requesting the ability to turn
the porn filter off after having classified himself as a youth.

You were born after 1988.
Yes
No

That was the age verification screen. You click either 'Yes' or 'No' to
continue. Of course the thoughtless thing to do is to click 'Yes'. Because
often in software we are initially asked various things to which we
sometimes thoughtlessly respond 'Yes'. So this catches the thoughtlessly
hasty, and, also, gives minors the opportunity to respond truthfully since
many youngsters just simply don't want to be shown sexually explicit
material.

However, it is true that the above question is not infallible in verifying
that a youth is a youth (which is more important than verifying that an
adult is an adult). So I have simply disabled, for all people, the ability
to turn the porn filter off. The porn filter is on and cannot be removed by
anybody, now.

The porn filters that Google and Yahoo have built are remarkably effective,
I think. I suppose they deal with the matter in several ways. First, the
search language can be analysed for typical porn language and simply return
no images in such case. Secondly, there are long lists available that list
porn site urls. These lists are used by a variety of software programs that
seek to block porn, and it seems likely that Google and Yahoo etc use at
least one such list in their filtered image search. Also, the language of
the url of the image and the html page itself on which the image is found
can be analyzed for sexual content, as well as the name of the graphic.
Finally, there are actually algorithms that examine the graphics themselves
for proportion of skin tones. This seems likely to exclude pictures of
hands, for instance. It seems likely that there is going to be much more
than porn excluded from such filters, and also a very small proportion of
porn must surely creep into the results, though I haven't seen that myself
yet.

However, when we look at the effectiveness of related filters, such as email
spam filters, which probably correctly identify over 99% of spam and very
very rarely identify valid email as spam, we see that such filters are
getting quite good. In the case of email filters, it is important not to
identify valid email as spam. In the case of image search, it isn't so
important whether non-porn is identified as porn, and thereby excluded,
since there are so many millions of images on the net to choose from. Indeed
it would be more important to exclude suspected porn than include an image
that only *might* be porn. So porn filters would be different from email
filters in their decision weightings.

As usual, sexual content is heavily monitored but graphic violence is not
monitored.

As I mentioned earlier, dbcinema is at its best when the language you use is
not associated with consumerism or specific products. Actually it's kind of
an interesting index of the state of any given word or phrase, ie, the
collective visual associations with any word or phrase usually are indicated
in interesting ways in an image search. In a sense, the porn filter is going
to remove the sexual overtones of the visual representation of language, and
this is surely unfortunate, but dbcinema is available to anyone over the
net, kids and adults, so it seems like the responsible, adult thing to do is
to have the porn filter on and not allow it to be turned off.

 WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT

PRACTICAL CRITICISM: A POETRY WORKSHOP =E2=80=93 TONY TOWLE
TUESDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 14TH
=20
=E2=80=9CIt is assumed that participants will be serious, practicing poets and so
critiques and comments will be made from the vantage point of what the
person has already established, not with a view to =E2=80=98prescribing=E2=80=99 some
different way of writing. However, stretching the sensibility will be
encouraged, both in the group and through individual suggestion. Non-bindin=
g
assignments will be given each week and poems from the past as well as thos=
e
of the workshop participants will be read aloud and discussed. In the cours=
e
of this, numerous poets past and present, and topics both literary and
general, will arise and be talked about. Also I will make written comments
on poems individuals may prefer not to have read aloud.=E2=80=9D John Ashbery has
written: =E2=80=9CTony Towle is one of the best-kept secrets of the New York

THE UNPERFORMABLE: THE VISUAL SIDE OF POETRY =E2=80=93 EVELYN REILLY
THURSDAYS at 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 16TH
=20
=E2=80=9CThe traditional notion of poetry as primarily a matter of =E2=80=9Cvoice=E2=80=9D ha=
s often
obscured its graphic and visual character, and can limit the range of
experiment to what can be experienced in the venue of the poetry reading.
Even the most performance-based poets, however, face issues of how to
spatialize their work on the page, and every line break is as much a visual
as a rhythmic and aural decision. This workshop will explore a broad range
of visual poetics =E2=80=94 from modernist innovations to composition-by-field to
recent spatialized text, concrete, collage, and digital poetry. We will
examine work by Mallarme, Apollinaire, cummings, Olson, Schwerner, Hak Kyun=
g
Cha, Aram Saroyan and Susan Howe, and peruse the UbuWeb site together.
Everyone will be encouraged to analyze the visual assumptions behind their
poems as well as to write or revise work using alternative visual
conventions.=E2=80=9D Evelyn Reilly=E2=80=99s book Hiatus was published by Barrow Stree=

the differences between knowledge and information, and what are we putting
into our poems? Why? We will look at poets & projects confronting these

what we value, how to assess the values of any given poem. We may address
contradictions in literal or figurative yogic practice and the

I want to mention that we have nearly sold out of all of our Pavement Saw chapbooks
except for Knute Skinner's from 2005. These will not be reprinted, so, if you are interested this is the last chance, these are $6 each including postage payable via
paypal to info@pavementsaw.org or send a check to our address at the bottom. These were all printed in a run of 400 copies except Naton Leslie's chap which was 500. All chapbooks not mentioned here are out of print. Here is our remaining inventory from _all_ of our chapbook titles--

  13 copies of The People Instruments by Amy King
  14 copies of War Holdings by Lisa Samuels
11 copies of Sauce Robert by FJ Bergmann
4 copies of Add Musk Here by John Bradley
7 copies of Disrobing by Gina M. Tabasso
3 copies of The Root by Mark Taksa
19 copies of Shooting the Strays by Rose M. Smith
12 copies of Their Shadows are Dark Daughters by Naton Leslie
22 copies of Pants (2nd edition) by Shelley Stenhouse
8 copies of Tampon Class by Mary E. Weems

  Our literary journal (551 copies per ish) is also about to disappear, issues 1-6 are out of print, I have left
  # 7 the Ultimate Issue ($7 p/p) only 23 copies
#8 The Man PO ($7 p/p)
  #9 The Last LAFT double issue ($12p/p) only 14 copies

  I have 4 copies of Robert Grenier's 12 from r h y m m s $20

  I have 7 copies left of the first edition of Errol Miller's full length book Magnolia Hall. It is a superior work of southern experimentation and it is doubtful it will be reprinted. $10

  I expect these will all be gone by the time we go to AWP in Austin. Thanks--!




Be well

This is the best analysis of of the relationship between computer (its logic?
information, image structure?) ande poetry/art I have read. Thank you. It

this still happens in 2006??????

anyway, I wouldn't ordinarily do this on the list, but since I was asked:

first thing to do is get the new anthology from U of Alabama Press:

EVERY GOODBYE AIN'T GONE: AN ANTHOLOGY OF INNOVATIVE POETRY BY AFRICAN
AMERICANS

ed. by Lauri Ramey and Aldon Nielsen

this book is just a map, running roughly from the late 40s Tolson up
through the late 70s, with more to follow in a second volume -- but it has
LOTS of work you won't be able to find elsewhere --

as to critical stuff by me, the most relevant are the books BLACK CHANT,
WRITING BETWEEN THE LINES, and INTEGRAL MUSIC -- all still in print --

but there are lots of chapters, essays, talks  etc. by people such as Kathy
Crown, Elizabeth Frost, Meta Jones, Evie Sedgewick, Grant Jenkins, Mendi
Obadike, C.S. Giscombe, Nathaniel Mackey, and god knows how many others I
hope won't be insulted that I didn't list them in the hurried response on
my way to a meeting -- point being, there's really no good reason to
overlook this material at this late stage of the scholarship -- there never
was a GOOD reason, but at least 20 years ago people could claim that it was
hard to track down --

and there's another anthology just out from U of Miami Press of poets who
participated in their major conference on African American poetry of two
years ago, including several of the more innovative writers --

and your library MUST get all the issues of giovanni singleton's journal
Nocturnes  (the poetry collection probably already has it, no?)

and the special issue of Tripwire that grew out of a colloquium in San
Francisco on this subject a few years back --

etc. -- Kathy Lou!  Why don't you jump in on this thread!

Chapbooks are woefully under-represented in the review
sections of most journals (some do make efforts to include
reviews of chaps), whether those journals be on-line or print.
 As an on-line chapbook *press*, we at Beard of Bees are
really two-time losers, since too there seems to be a
continued idea that on-line chapbook and book publishing is
somehow of less value, professionally, than traditional print
publication.

One way to help legitimize on-line chapbook and book
publishing is to have quality reviews of said publications
published in journals.  I've e-mailed our link to several
print journals with review requests (just like sending print
books in for review) but to no avail.  Of course, they may
have considered the chaps unworthy; however, they may have
just completely ignored the request.

That said--please consider jotting short reviews of any
chapbooks on our list (or on anybody's list, on-line or not
on-line) that strike your fancy, maybe even including a squib
about the "on-line reading experience."  Post it on a blog;
send it to a journal; staple it onto a telephone pole...

Dear Eric,

I agree with you.  Chapbooks are a much more available and fluent form of =
publication than books for me as I find book publication elusive.  With =
chapbooks, I enjoy precious relationships with publishers, also the =
pleasure of
fast completion of projects.  Two (print) chapbooks of mine published in =
2005, AN EDUCATED HEART (Palm Press 2005) and VIVAS (Wild Honey Press =
2005) were reviewed in MiPOesias www.mipoesias.com, and the British =
webjournal LITTER http://leafepress.com/litter/.  You might find both =
those publications hospitable to Beard of Bees. =20

A 2004 online chapbook, CHINA DOGS (Poetic Inhalation, 2004) was not =
reviewed and Poetic Inhalation itself no longer has a site, so the =
chapbook is not available except in archives.  I think old habits may die =
hard as far as clutching something in your hand that you're going to =
review is concerned.  But it's only a matter of time and critical mass.  =
Today I read something Reb Livingstone said about not understanding why =
many web journals are published in issues rather than rolling editions.  =
The gestalt of a journal may still derive from the print model but that =
will change.

Chapbooks are definitely a vital form of publication, increasingly so; I =
can only see web journals becoming increasingly friendly to reviewing both =
print and e-chapbooks.
I'm not so sure about print journals, which are more arthritic, sort of =
lumbering at the picnic while the little chapbooks are running around =
everywhere! =20

Meanwhile, I guess we have to step forward and offer to review more.  =
That's not the royal we.  I mean I.  So I'm off to browse your site.

Sincerely,

Mairead

Dear Eric, Mairead and others,

My Call for GR (below) seems timely -- synchronicity.  Please note, too, the=

offer to e-publish previously hard-copy reviews.  Anyway, here 'tis
Eileen Tabios

++++++++++++++++++

A Call from GALATEA RESURRECTS (A Poetry Review)

Dear All,
I'm inaugurating (as Managing Editor) a new online publication called
=A0
GALATEA RESURRECTS (A Poetry Review)
=A0
I hope the inaugural issue will come out sometime in March or so.  The focus=
=20
of GR will be presenting poetry reviews (though there will be interim poetry=
=20
features). =20
=A0
So this email is to say I am looking for folks interested in writing reviews=
=20
for GR.  I've backchanneled a few folks and have gotten review commitments=20
from Barry Schwabsky, Thomas Fink, kari edwards, and Guillermo Juan Parra, a=
mong=20
others.  I drop their names because I'm writing this Call before there's an=20
issue out there that I can point to as a sample issue.

The goal of this project is to offer another venue for poetry reviews and=20
hopefully expand discourse.  It's not limited to "new" poetry publications -=
- all=20
books, chaps, broadsides and other poetry publications, as long as they're=20
still in print and available to the public, are eligible to be reviewed. =20
Indeed, we encourage reviewing books that you may feel have been undeservedl=
y=20
ignored. =20

Reviewers will be "paid" with books (which you don't have to review) from=20
certain titles published by Meritage Press (http://meritagepress.com) or, if=
=20
there's interested, with books by the Managing Editor (assume smiley here) =20=
The=20
author of the review most enjoyed over the course of a calendar year by=20
Oenophiles for Poetry also will receive a bottle of wine.*

And because the project is just to support the expansion of poetry discourse=
,=20
GR is also available for reprinting reviews previously published in print bu=
t=20
not yet on the Internet.  We've all heard how online readership often=20
supplants print readership, and I wanted to offer a means for expanding the=20=
audience=20
for reviews worth reading but which may not be accessible if the journals ar=
e=20
no longer around or have small print runs.  (Previous publishers will be=20
acknowledged, of course.)=20

Finally, if you wish your poetry publications considered for reviews, send a=
=20
copy to me at
=A0
Eileen Tabios
256 North Fork Crystal Springs Road
St. Helena, CA 94574
=A0
Obviously, there's no guarantee that your publication will be reviewed but=20
here I am with open arms.  Please feel free to query me directly if you have=
=20
questions.=20
=A0
Best,
Eileen Tabios

Should we also mention - we should - the world of poetry ebooks, a
flourishing form for many poets, with little or no critical attention. I
have done two - to beat the digital drum - in the last two years

Sleeping With Sappho (a faux ebook)at:
http://www.fauxpress.com/e/vincent/

And

The publishers report many visitors, at least 'grazers', but precious few
reviews. Lars Palm's blog mishievoice,
http://mischievoice.blogspot.com/
has started to review some, including an upcoming one next week of Triggers.

Ebooks, similar to chapbooks, are a great and efficient way - especially if
well designed - to get an initial phase or portion of a larger book into the
public eye. But - as a public realm in terms of response - they still remain
as ephemeral or as elusive as the well made poetry broadside.

Sentence: A Journal of Prose Poetics reviews chapbooks of prose poetry,
experimental prose, and similar or related work in every issue. We're
always happy to receive review copies and always looking for new
reviewers. Our review section has limited space--usually about 20 pages.
Any chap/books that don't get reviewed are listed in our Also Received
section. If you have titles that you think may be appropriate for our
scope, please le me know and I'll add them to our review list.

Reviews of Chapbooks






Chapbooks are woefully under-represented in the review
sections of most journals (some do make efforts to include
reviews of chaps), whether those journals be on-line or print.
 As an on-line chapbook *press*, we at Beard of Bees are
really two-time losers, since too there seems to be a
continued idea that on-line chapbook and book publishing is
somehow of less value, professionally, than traditional print
publication.

One way to help legitimize on-line chapbook and book
publishing is to have quality reviews of said publications
published in journals.  I've e-mailed our link to several
print journals with review requests (just like sending print
books in for review) but to no avail.  Of course, they may
have considered the chaps unworthy; however, they may have
just completely ignored the request.

That said--please consider jotting short reviews of any
chapbooks on our list (or on anybody's list, on-line or not
on-line) that strike your fancy, maybe even including a squib
about the "on-line reading experience."  Post it on a blog;
send it to a journal; staple it onto a telephone pole...

So few books get reviewed, period, fewer chapbooks, and books/chapbooks
of poetry? A spiral of diminishing returns, perhaps. Obviously it takes
a bit more time to write even the shortest review/response to a book
than to read it and move on, which is why I enjoy the lists offered
sometimes here and elsewhere of people's recent reads -- micro-reviews
or reviews in potentia, those, for me. Otherwise, formal reviews strike
me as targeted, political things that turn on personal, social
relationships as opposed to, say, economies of attention, worth, or
perceived value.

Also, I'm not sure I agree that chapbooks are  "more available and
fluent form" but i agree that's been the case. With print-on-demand,
that might be changing, particularly with regard to speed of
turnaround. And I think the nature of the relationship with the
publisher has a lot more to do with the publisher, and the publishee,
than with the form. There's the risk of positioning things along
familiar hi/lo divides with chaps as somehow inherently more intimate
and "spines" as more removed, professional, elite. But... maybe that's
a common experience, so ...

Might be best, and more efficient, to review in "batches" -- which I
think Mairead and others have done -- focusing on an imprint or a
locale. Makes for better reading, too, I think in the treatment of
context, and less about close-reading a solo effort to oblivion.

The Journal of Aesthetics and Protest, in
collaboration with freelance editor Colin Dickey, will
be producing a unique book project whose topic is the
aesthetics of failure. Below, please find this
projects call for submissions.

Send all submission ideas to
contact@journalofaestheticsandprotest.com
or Colin Dickey at cdickey@nu.edu.

(Note; Colin wrote an amazing article in issue #3,
"Metaphysics, Protest, and the Politics of Spectacular
Failure."

http://www.joaap.org/new3/index.php?page=dickey)

FAILURE: IDEALISM AND HISTORY
Proposals are invited for a volume on the topic of
failure, and its relationship to idealism and history,
to be published in conjunction with the Journal of
Aesthetics and Protest (http://www.joap.org).

We're interested primarily in those historical and
aesthetic failures which  are a result of a powerful,
if sometimes naïve, idealism, out of step  with their
own contexts.  Either a result of the exhaustion of a
moment  and/or movement, pushed to its logical (or
illogical)conclusion (such as the Children's Crusades
of 1212, or the Weather Underground), or the result of
the utter misunderstanding of a historical moment
(novelist Yukio Mishima's attempt to re-ignite fascism
in post-war Japan).

The question of re-visiting these various cultural,
historical, artistic moments is inevitably an
exploration of the relationship between an act and its
historical moment, and bringing that relationship into
the present. While a success may seem to be something
that determines the shape of history, failures on a
colossal and spectacular scale are often those things
that bring history, culture, and art most sharply into
relief.

We're looking for essays, interviews, fiction, poetry,
visual explorations (e.g., photo-essays) or aesthetic
experiments that deal  with the topic of failure and
its relationship to idealism and history.

Possible topics include: failed utopias, failure and
tragedy, failed  political movements (including
Marxism), specific literary or artistic  works (such
as Gertrude Stein's The Making of Americans), the
failure of the Iraq war  protests, various arguments
on the failure of the avant-garde and/or  modernism,
specific theorists relationship to failure
(e.g.,Deleuze  and Guattari, Hakim Bey, Derrida),
technology and failure, the
history  of failure, failure and architecture,
alternative psychology movements,  failed public art
(e.g., Tilted Arc).

Please send a 300 word abstract or description of the
project, as a Word attachment, to Colin Dickey,
cdickey@nu.edu, by February 15, 2006.

Notification for selected work will be February
28,2006, and   completed works will be due no later
than June 1, 2006.

  Rachel Blau Duplessis, author of the long and continually evolving poem “Drafts” skillfully blends elements of Objectivism, “Language” poetry, and standard lyricism with the epic expansiveness of Williams, Olson, Zukofsky and Pound. “Drafts” is a tapestry of enormous scope and equally enormous delicacy. Beginning with the contentious assertion, “There will be no point….to all this”, Duplessis treats the engaged reader to a sophisticated, cerebral, emotional, historical, anti-historical
  mélange of themes, thoughts, images, and allusions.
     You can read two of Rachel's wonderful DRAFTS, a long interview w/ Rachel (click on "Adam Fieled"), & more intro stuff at PFS Post (www.artrecess.blogspot.com).

Thanks, Murat. I think you are being very generous; if that was what it
revealed to you, I think much of it must have been your own thoughts on the
matter.

I have wondered about the relationship between dbcinema and poetry myself.
Like, is there any? But, over time, it seems there is. What Google/Yahoo/etc
image search does is create/discover the relationship between alphabetic
language and digital images. And then enable us to search for images with
alphabetic language. In turn, that will allow us to explore visual language
in new ways.

For instance, we see in 'Guess the Google' by Grant Robinson (
http://grant.robinson.name/projects/guess-the-google ) and 'Visual Poetry'
by Douwe Osinga ( http://douweosinga.com/projects/googlehacks ) the
beginning of computer works that use image search to communicate with
images. Alphabetic language is being communicated, in a real sense, but it
is not seen, only is inferable from the images, in the case of Robinson's
piece. So we can imagine poetries of strings solely of images, or of
interplay between the images and the alphabetic language. In the case of
Osinga's 'Visual Poetry', the relationship is quite explicit: you type a
sentence, and each word is simply 'translated' into an image. We can infer
from these two pieces future works that are not so explicit in the
relationships they draw between the textual and the image, works that
attempt, for instance, to present sequences of images as poems, where the
sequence of images actually corresponds to a sequence of words but the idea
is not so much to 'guess the sequence of googles' as to 'read' the thing as
a sort of cinematic, poetic experience.

In the computer, it's all just ons and offs, zeroes and ones. All images
represented in the computer, all videos, texts, sounds, etc, are all coded
in zeroes and ones. That introduces the possibility of relating them between
one another in ways that previous technologies have not permitted. It brings
text, sound, image, video, etc into dynamic relationship with one another.
Relationship in which the textual underlies the relationship, for the most
part, ie, it is largely the textual that glues them together. So that
digital poetic language is comprised not only of the textual but other media
as well, though in a sense it is the textual that underlies it all.

Is this the sort of thing you were thinking of?

ja

  Subject: Book Project -- FAILURE: IDEALISM AND HISTORY


  The Journal of Aesthetics and Protest, in
  collaboration with freelance editor Colin Dickey, will
  be producing a unique book project whose topic is the
  aesthetics of failure. Below, please find this
  projects call for submissions.

  Send all submission ideas to
  contact@journalofaestheticsandprotest.com =20
  or Colin Dickey at cdickey@nu.edu.

  (Note; Colin wrote an amazing article in issue #3,
  "Metaphysics, Protest, and the Politics of Spectacular
  Failure."=20

  http://www.joaap.org/new3/index.php?page=3Ddickey)

  FAILURE: IDEALISM AND HISTORY
  Proposals are invited for a volume on the topic of
  failure, and its relationship to idealism and history,
  to be published in conjunction with the Journal of
  Aesthetics and Protest (http://www.joap.org). =20

  We're interested primarily in those historical and
  aesthetic failures which  are a result of a powerful,
  if sometimes na=EFve, idealism, out of step  with their
  own contexts.  Either a result of the exhaustion of a
  moment  and/or movement, pushed to its logical (or
  illogical)conclusion (such as the Children's Crusades
  of 1212, or the Weather Underground), or the result of
  the utter misunderstanding of a historical moment
  (novelist Yukio Mishima's attempt to re-ignite fascism
  in post-war Japan). =20

  The question of re-visiting these various cultural,
  historical, artistic moments is inevitably an
  exploration of the relationship between an act and its
  historical moment, and bringing that relationship into
  the present. While a success may seem to be something
  that determines the shape of history, failures on a
  colossal and spectacular scale are often those things
  that bring history, culture, and art most sharply into
  relief.

  We're looking for essays, interviews, fiction, poetry,
  visual explorations (e.g., photo-essays) or aesthetic
  experiments that deal  with the topic of failure and
  its relationship to idealism and history.  =20

  Possible topics include: failed utopias, failure and
  tragedy, failed  political movements (including
  Marxism), specific literary or artistic  works (such
  as Gertrude Stein's The Making of Americans), the
  failure of the Iraq war  protests, various arguments
  on the failure of the avant-garde and/or  modernism,=20
  specific theorists relationship to failure
  (e.g.,Deleuze  and Guattari, Hakim Bey, Derrida),
  technology and failure, the
  history  of failure, failure and architecture,
  alternative psychology movements,  failed public art
  (e.g., Tilted Arc).

  Please send a 300 word abstract or description of the
  project, as a Word attachment, to Colin Dickey,
  cdickey@nu.edu, by February 15, 2006. =20

  Notification for selected work will be February
  28,2006, and   completed works will be due no later
  than June 1, 2006.

Please help to celebrate and support Carolyn Beard Whitlow's second
collection of poetry, Vanished, now available through Lotus Press.

The following information includes her biography and an announcement of
the collection:

Biography:

Selected as one of ten North Carolina poets to appear on the 1997 PBS
series "Poetry Live" hosted by Charles Kuralt, recipient of a 2001 and
2002 Yaddo Residency, and a Cave Canem Fellow, Carolyn Beard Whitlow, is
Charles A. Dana Professor of English at Guilford College in Greensboro,
NC, where she teaches creative writing and African-American literature.
Finalist for the 1991 Barnard New Women Poets Prize, and the 2005 Ohio
State University Poetry Prize, she won the 2006 Naomi Long Madgett Prize
in Poetry, the winning manuscript, Vanished, published by Lotus Press in
Detroit. She wrote her first poem at 30 years old while a Ph.D.
candidate at Cornell University and, subsequently, completed the M.F.A.
at Brown University, where she won the Rose Low Rome Memorial Prize in
Poetry, and was named Phi Beta Kappa Poet in 1989. Lost Roads published
her first collection of poems, Wild Meat, in 1986, and her poems and
essays have appeared in numerous journals and anthologies.

Announcement:


Carolyn
<http://bloggingpoet.squarespace.com/bloggingpoetcom/2006/1/12/carolyn-b
eard-whitlow-vanished.html>  Beard Whitlow's Vanished


Winner  of the 2006


Naomi Long Madgett Poetry Award



"In Vanished, Carolyn Beard Whitlow is as she says, 'seeking the heal of
words'-'some self assembly required.' Whether she uses a sestina or a
villanelle, Whitlow croons the blues of a strong-hearted woman singing
herself out of the past. Vanished performs magic-it gives voice to the
voiceless, body to the vanished. I love the nakedness of the love
poems.. There is no false turn in this book.."

-Toi Derricotte


"We have a siren who lives by metaphor, all the neighborhoods she's
occupied, traversed, transcended-and there are 'notes' at the end: much
of her history is not written down, or unwritten, or cadenced with a
'scrupulous meanness' (James Joyce) intended for dissection and worse,
the aftermath of slavery and neglect where 'some people talk back.' This
is a poet with fluency and cadence in prosody, an inclination toward
Motown and the blues, but feints in sestina and villanelle for both
circularity and word-play. She attends to organization, in units, as
increment, as progression: so many losses, frustrations, but beneath the
floss of voicing 'within the veil' a prideful storytelling in origami
detail: all in her own idiom. In her world one can become one's own
parents and kinfolk, the ancestors singing. 'And silence, too, is talk.'
(African proverb)."

It looks like I'll be teaching an undergraduate course entitled
"Creative Writing: Prose Non-fiction" in the spring at RIT.  Most of
the students -- 90% technology majors -- are unlikely to have had much
experience writing (or reading!) beyond what's been required in high
school.  Any suggestions for appropriate texts or materials? I'm happy
using Hazel Smith's  The Writing Experiment  (combined with a lot of
photocopied material of my choosing) in another more poetry-oriented
creative writing class, but I'm not sure how I might set up a creative
writing
non-fiction syllabus...   Linda

Linda,
I'm a great fan of the M.I.T. program's Technical Communication =
materials:
two works in particular:

A Writer's Guide for Engineers & Scientists  and

Communicating Technical Information =20

both works by Robert R. Rathbone

Given that you too are in a technical (engineering focused) facility, =
you might find these items helpful, and appropriate to your student =
make-up.=20

Hello everyone,

The submission period for the Blackbox winter gallery is now closed.  Thanks
to all who sent work, and a special thanks to those few who actually followed
the submission guidelines.  Heh!

I am still working with a couple of artists who submitted before the
deadline, but whose submissions ran into problems.  So there may be a couple of
additions.  Otherwise the winter gallery is complete and will be available for
viewing later today.  The eclectic offerings include Ron Padgett, Richard
Kostelanetz, William James Austin, Steve Dalachinsky, jukka-pekka kervinen, Michelle
Greenblatt, Vernon Frazer, kari edwards, F. J. Bergmann, mIEKAL aND, Nicholas
Karavatos, and Paul Nelson.

As always, go to WilliamJamesAustin.com and follow the Blackbox link.  Or go
directly to WilliamJamesAustin.com/Blackbox.html.   Remember to stroll
(scroll) through the galleries until you reach the latest exhibition.  Lots of
admirable work on view along the way.

I will be open for spring gallery submissions sometime in April, and will
make the announcement at that time.

Again, many thanks to all who contribute to, and support, my little project.

Best, Bill

Hi Peter
I wd like to order Jukka's book, in part to see what a blue lion book looks
like.
We have hired Christina Strong to do the design work on the book--she
designed one of Jukka's books--I think for Chax Press. I have given her
almost everything of mine and she is starting this weekend. Do the books
have T of C and page numbers? Rusty will give her his work soon so things
are coming along.
How are you?
Best,
Ruth

I am not sure if Charles wanted dead or living poets so, of those who passed,
  Charlie Rossiter mentioned Allen's reading at the QE2, that was really something. & I agree, something was missing at the large venue. Creeley readings, there was one with Mercury Rev was fantastic but the last time I saw Bob read it was not so hot, it was a "going thru the motions" type thing for AWP, which did not surprise me. Seeing John Wieners read was heartbreaking, the condition he was in.

  Of those still around: Lucille Clifton, Gerrit Lansing, Todd Colby, Bill Luoma,  Maj Ragain, Julie Otten, Terri Ford (w/ Uncle Glockenspiel, this one man band person she was touring with), John M. Bennett (especially when wearing his "word suit"), Tyrone Williams, Richard Blevins, Brian Richards, Ralph LaCharity, and Jack Gilbert. Especially Jack, he listens to the acoustics in a room and adjusts his tone & timber accordingly, uses silence in a way that few poets are able.



Be well

"There many kinds of men and women and I know it. They
repeat it and I hear it and I love it. This is now a
history of the way they do it. This is now a history
of the
way I love it.

Now I will tell of the meaning to me in repeating, of
the loving there is in me for repeating."

- Gertrude Stein
------------------------------------------------------

....as a stein-o-phile, i don't view "the making of
americans" itself as a failure.  but -- how about the
trouble stein had getting the work published, read,
and appreciated in her own time?  a true failure of
the american imagination.

alas, i'm not connected to the following book project.
only the messenger who emailed it along to see what
others might come up with.

Just noticed no one mentioned Jayne Cortez.
She's amazing. She should also be on the list of the best readers though, strangely, I have
only heard her read on CD with her band, never in person. (sigh) Is Wanda
Coleman experimental? Kind of a vague term. She writes in various styles,
the language in some of the poems does more than in others. But maybe.

Jayne Cortez did a wonderful reading for us at Penn State last semester -- While
I have all of her recordings, I've never gotten to see her live with the band
-- positive reports from her band performance at Southern Illinois a few months
back -- think they might have been at Minnesota too, is that right Maria?

You can see her on film in the much recirculated POETRY IN MOTION video --

anybody know of other Jayn Cortez video -- I have a video of her lecture at the
Yari Yari conference --

When Edgard Varese, the composer, was asked once about
being an experimental composer, he responded, "When I'm
done composing a piece, the experiment is over."

Congratulations to Joshua Clover for today's Sunday NYT Book Review of
Reznikoff's Collected (Black Sparrow). So refreshing to get a poet whose
work has real weight, and enduring significance. (I do wish the paper would
have put up a window on a Reznikoff poem as an example of the work).

I do not know what shapes choices for poetry reviews at the NYT - I hope
they can keep opening it up to other significant work. Reading the Book
Review - decade by decade - I suspect among many of us this is a reoccurring
prayer, to which, "Lot's of luck" is the common, jaded response.

In the meantime thanks to Clover for making, at least, a momentary wedge!

Yesterday I  went to hear Richard Long (walker, sculptor & photographer)
give a lecture and (extensive) slide show of his work, as well as to see th=
e
installation of his recent site specific Sierra mountain walk, including
photographs, text and mudwall hand paintings at San Francisco's MOMA. Such
lovely work, but a troubling human presence. Long is more of what I would
call a "geomancer" than one interested in human relations within and about
the variously global habitats of his long walk and camping visitations.
(Most often there are no people visible at all).  The actual work -
photographs and texts, however, possess an extraordinary sense of precision=
,
spatial relations and time. Indeed the work, as he admits, a form of earth
science, one with roots in ancient origins and practice - whether for
religious or other cosmological purposes of study.
During the period of questions at the end of the talk, I threw him what was
probably a "ringer":  =B3What kind of reading informs your work?=B2
He looked puzzled, so I asked, in the long tradition of English walkers and
writers, =B3Like do your read Wordsworth?=B2 I had no doubt that that would pus=
h
a button!
He reacted with the contempt that many mininamlist sculptors no doubt
reserve for romantics.
"No, I don't read Wordsworth."  And then made mention that he was reading a
popular detective writer.
In the context of his recent 20 day walk in the Sierra along the Pacific
Crest Trail, there was no indication he had read  John Muir, Rexroth, Snyde=
r
or Whalen=B9s work in those same mountains - which is, I suspect, must remain=
,
at least a personal loss, though I do not how the  reading of those writers
might have shaped this recent work at all.  (Well, if he actually read a
history of the Donner Party - in reference to a slide of a circle of stones
he built there - he would not have said the Party was merely "stranded
there." It was not like those in the Party who either died or barely
survived had just missed a bus!)

When I did not budge from my question, or looked at him as if he were not
being fully truthful, he allowed that had recently read a book on gravity
and Newton.

Which was right on his mark, his work. Long, I would saym is  kind of
scientist of =B3the sublime,=B2 though I am sure he does not frequently use tha=
t
=B3word=B2 in his vocabulary. But much of the work is =AD framed by classical
formal elements (circle, line, time units) -  in its precision and severity
-  incredibly beautiful, indeed. Sublime. (If I can be critically
comparative, Long=B9s work definitely sub-rates the crowd pleasing, Hallmark
card aspects- and no where near the intelligence - of much of the work of
Andy Goldsworthy).=20

But it intrigues me how many artists =AD in this case those in a minimalist
tradition (Carl Andre, Judd, DeMaria, etc.) tend to avoid the literature
about the spaces that their work inhabits. Not always. Smithson, for
example, seems very conversant with the literature and history of, say, wha=
t
occurred about the site of Spiral Jetty (intentionally siting it near the
golden spike that connected the first transcontinental railroad.)

Unfortunately I did not get to ask Richard Long  if he even reads Thomas A.
Clark - the Scottish poet who also examines remote landscapes in an also
rigorous fashion - though, different from Long,  Clark is much more
interested in the human implication of what he discovers on his walks. Long=
,
by the way, is quite insistent that his text pieces not be confused with
poems. The words he considers as "objects", not different than individual
stones or other natural items, and shape in which the are printed on the
paper correspond to shape of the walk or some aspect of the terrain. The
elegant portrayal of evidence - the printed works.

In fariness, I guess we can also count multiples the number of writers who
have no literacy around the visual! It's probably the sad irony of so many
art programs in the way they exclude literature study  from their
requirements, and, reciprocally, the way creative writing programs remain
blind to visual literature, let alone the history of music, avant garde
innovation, etc. Whatever writers, artists or composers discover beyond the
frames of their discipline, I suspect is left  to do it on their own.  I
suspect, or imagine the multi-disciplinary character of computer technology
is rapidly altering the situation (tho I personally do not know if the
'pedagogy' is keeping up with these changes at all. )

Oh well, similar to scientists and surgeons, there is nothing to expect in
Long's work to suspect him to be an  expert in human or social relations =AD
(spatial relations, yes) He likes being out there long, and often alone.
Yet, one must applaud the counter-imperial, non-monumental, ephemeral
character of the work - Long clearly means no natural harm - and only bring=
s
home primarily  the visual record and analysis of what he has temporarily
built, discovered and witnessed with camera and journal.
No small achievement. Paradoxically - for the space of an exhibit, or in th=
e
presence of many of his books - the evidence is touchingly,  not only
beautiful, but large and instructive.

the only visual artist i know is beverley carpenter
http://www.freewebs.com/cambourneartist/. she maintains a commitment
to text, having studied under George Szirtes at one stage, although
she usually brings in somebody else to do the text - see
http://www.beverleycarpenter.co.uk/htdocs/asylum.htm. She's well,
brilliant is just one of the words that springs to mind.

i recall having a heated conversation btn myself and her boyfriend
(another visual artist, Rob Long) about a display in the Fitzwilliam
of Lucien Freuds etchings. I got fixated on the labels Freud had given
his etchings. Freud did a series of etchings direct to copper plate,
quite impressive technically speaking, except that he'd decided to
give them labels (apparently, according to freud, art gallery curators
usually screw this bit up). The choice of text seemed to me to
indicate real problems with his work, apart from the overall machismo
of his technique. For example, one portrait was entitled "head of an
irishman" (this one was particularly problematic), he didn't label the
"famous" characters (I recognised a couple of these "famous" people,
but I suspect not many below the age of 40 would do), and one "a
woman" could have done without it as the portrait had a pleasing
androgynous quality. So, I says to Rob, "don't you have a problem with
the labels?" "What labels..."

in some respect, i wonder if both parties are blind to the others
concerns because that's the way they are... poets and writers tend to
see the world wholly through text (and memory to a large extent)
whereas artists see the world through images, the here and now (the
latter makes O'Hara very interesting). As poets, I think we maintain a
touching faith in the world of text and I think we're particularly
disturbed when we meet people who don't share it. I used to measure
people in terms of their book collections, towns in how many bookshops
they had. I got ahead because I read books, wrote essays. I remember
watching Beverley tear a book up. This act seemed to me to be
rebarbative and shocking, and the act continues to echo through my
work and practice. It was one of the factors that made me look at the
tidy nest of books I had hauled with me through my life, echoing my
fixations (http://www.badstep.net/image/collage/shelford/death-of-soldiers.=
jpg,
which is a collage of some of the books that i owned) and aspirations
(all those computer books), and deciding that I should be a little
less attached to them and how I viewed the world through them ...

Our practices met through collage
(http://www.badstep.net/image/collage/shelford/shelford.jpg). She was
worried, I think, when I dabbled in film
(http://www.badstep.net/image/moving/index.html) then, horror of
horrors, I started into representational art
(http://www.badstep.net/image/representational/long-road-autumn-2005/index.=
html).
For me, drawing represents a visceral sense of the here and and now, a
thinking directly in the now, with the body.  Poetry seems to be more
about thought, memory, recovery, contemplation and semantics of text.
My sense so far is that poetry and art don't meet easily. See
http://sherbooke.livejournal.com/2006/01/21/ for example. (apologies
that this has turned into an advert for my amateur scratchings). Ummm.
A friend of mine in Cambridge, a poet, is a watercolourist. I'll have
to think on this. The thoughts aren't fully formed yet.

Actually, Richard Long reminds me of  Lottie Glob, a danish sculptor
who settled in Durness in Scotland
(http://www.durness.org/Balnakeil%20Craft%20Village.htm). She goes off
for days or weeks into the mountains with nothing but some food and a
plastic bag, and deposits her sculptures in the mountains. None of her
work strikes me as being particularly literate. I don't know her
practise, but i'm willing to wager that she doesnt grok "the word"
either in such a big way. I almost met her, but she was out in the
hills somewhere...

Alison's comment about inter-disciplinary curiousity is interesting.
It's not that this has just happened. People - particularly visual
artists, have rubbed along without recourse to other disciplines quite
happily for a long time now as far as I can see. There's a whole
history of it. Read any biog of the major artists, look at photographs
of them in their studios, their homes. I think you'll search a long
time before you find evidence of books in those photos. Even more so,
evidence of the kind that Stephen seems to long for. I'm not saying it
doesn't happen, i just think it's rare.

The book isn't the only means of carrying knowledge in the world. In
fact, for Richard Long, it might be a drag on his work, it might
"poison"  or "pollute" the way he looks at the world. I'm not saying
this is so, I'm just postulating the counter theory that reliance on
text isn't always good. Recourse to a literate history might be
counter-productive or "evil" putting it in more fashionable terms.

ahh, work calls...

Jerome Rothenberg and I will be reading at Smith College on Tuesday,
February 14, 7:30pm, at Stoddard Hall Auditorium, as part of the
Granary Books show at the Museum.
In December, the Smith College Museum of Art has launched a web site
to coincide with the exhibition "Too Much Bliss: Twenty Years of
Granary Books," on view until February 19. The web site features
essays about a number of Granary books as well as a new digital
format that allows viewers to turn virtual pages of the reproduced
books. And beyond the remarkable virtual display, there a number of
great books presented -- including Jerry's fantastic collaboration
with Susan Bee, The Burning Babe --
http://www.smith.edu/artmuseum/exhibitions/granarybooks

My collaboration with Mimi Gross, Some of These Daze, is included in
the show. I recently wrote a statement about this collaboration (for
the web site) and have now posted it at
http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/blog/

can't remember which day but within the last few months, Stacy Szymascek
read in Philadelphia (@ F Sherlock's Night Flag series) with Kevin Varrone.
it was a really special night. both readers read keen, *solid* work, and
each read with direct & sincere connection - no pretense, no glaring ego
need, fully engaging, etc...wish i could remember a line or two at the
moment...

The minimalist concrete poetry site at:

http://www.logolalia.com/minimalistconcretepoetry/

has been updated with 12 pieces by Nico Vassilakis.

The phrase "the silence between words" gets bandied about so often and
in so many contexts that I wonder if any of you has ever stopped to
consider what the silence between words looks like. And what of the
silence between letters? Nico Vassilakis can show you both.

Enjoy,
Dan

this subject line is too funny. i used to deliver pizzas to smith
college after i graduated from hampshire, for a little joint called
pizza express.  the girls come to the door in their lantz nightgowns
and snatch the pizza from me, not tip me, and then call pizza express
and say next time send a guy.

=================================================

MLA 2006 CALL FOR PAPERS
THREE SESSIONS SPONSORED BY
CHICANA AND CHICANO LITERATURE DIVISION



Deadline for proposals:  March 1, 2006
Proposals must include 2-3 page CV and 500 word
abstract or 8-page paper.
Submit proposals to: Theresa Delgadillo
(delgadillo.1@nd.edu).


1. Visual Culture and Chicano/a Literature

Working from a broadest view of visual culture as
encompassing objects, images, seeing and new media we
welcome papers that analyze the influence or
significance of visual on literary or vice versa
and/or the convergence of visual and literary in new
(graphic novel) or old (illustrated, serialized
novels, film adaptations) forms.


2. Spirituality in Chicano/a Literature

Papers that examine the significance of spirituality
or the sacred, including spiritual figures (such as
mystics, healers, saints, shamans), traditions
(curanderismo, speaking-in-tongues, quest, pilgrimage)
or religions (Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism,
Indigenous cosmologies) in Chicano/a fiction, poetry,
essay, drama, performance or new media welcome.


3. Chicano/a Literary and Cultural Studies in the
Americas

Submit proposals that examine literary and cultural
exchange in the hemisphere, particularly intersections
and convergences between Chicano/a and
African-American, Native-American, Asian-American or
other Latino/a literary and cultural texts, between
Chicano/a and Latin American literary and cultural
texts, or between Chicano/a, Indigenous and diasporic
African or Asian texts and traditions throughout the
Americas.  What do we learn about the Americas or
about race, nation, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality
through these comparative analyses?  Is it really,
true, as the musical group War sings that â€œfor me and
for you, the world is a ghetto?â€ or do these distinct
texts and traditions create new spaces? Speak from
sites of privilege? Remap the continent? Create new
literary traditions?

Picturing Disaster: The 1906 Earthquake - Exhibit, San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art

This is a haunting show! Put together by Corey Keller, the Museum's
assistant curator, the photographs - some amateur, some commercial, some for
insurance companies - envelop, or are enveloped in smoke and ruin of
magical, clearly tragic proportions.

At a hundred years remove from the present, it is is a show that -
superficially - will draw in crowds of people, as was true Saturday. In
reality, the likelihood of another devastating earthquake is as ever
present, and certainly  a looming threat that no doubt penetrates and sits
in the psychic well of any resident in this part of California.

As art - one without the ego of the artist present - just the wonderful
orchestration, practically rhapsodic hand of the curator, deftly locating
and positioning the photographs - the aesthetic  experience of being within
the parameters of this show is akin to walking around within an elaborate
mausoleum  -  one in which one witnesses the borders between the dead and
the living, including the initial fiery transformation of one element (wood)
into another (smoke) - incredible, various shades of black, gray and white
billowing plumes of it rising from the insides and outsides of both small
and major buildings. The living, the refugees are in tents, in various
states of awe and shock,  looking down across the town or setting up
temporary coffee shops and construction sites on cracked, divided and
buckled streets that lie between the ghostly, skeletal building facades and
flattened foundations of burnt out ruins.

Indeed, walking through the three distinct spaces within the gallery, is as
if a visit to a tomb whose history and ghosts are still very much alive
below the City's psychic and collective surface. Geologically, with one
monstrous shake, what the photographs provide is evidence of what
undoubtedly fated to happen once again!

It's a timely show. Not only the anniversary of  '06, but in parallel with
the aftermath of Katrina, and life in the middle of a Presidential
Administration, one whose moves seem implicitly and often explicitly
apocalyptic: as if fundamentally possessed with a vision of smoke and ruins
in which 'good' American souls will arise. etc. It's a keynote show that
speaks to our collective edges.

In context of the museum's parallel Richard Long exhibit, it is also
interesting in the ways in which this show juxtaposes with the geometric
shapes and classical confidence of Long's walks, sculptures and photographs
- a work that, ironically, beautifully thrives the more for its reliance on
working with stones and other elements in the landscape, ones overtime that
are constantly at the mercy of geological eruption, including, no doubt,
major earthquakes.

Often - as it seemed with Richard Long 'in performance - the politics of
rich and/or poor painters (or artists) is to ignore poets, poetry, and 'us'.
I suspect - though I could be wrong - "they" - those kinds of artists -  do
not die from the lack of it (poetry).

In the way that many of us - or our poetry - would die from the lack of
looking to painting and photography and hearing music: the way each medium
feeds and variously helps frame the work.

And, yet, looking around there are examples of cross-fertilization of
mediums and collaborations everywhere (in the USA, Granary books, Kelsey
Street Press, poets theaters, Brian Steffans' projects, to name a brief
few).

The limits of much educational curricula  and cruel economics sully the
potential for intermarriage of the media. And yet, what young person,
particularly, cannot be vulnerable to all art mediums, incorporating them
via computer technologies - where "Adobe" ought to be a verb("Adobe it").
(Let alone all the other kinds of knowledge - if pursued - that impact a
work).

Yet - whether or not one intermarries one's form with another, or just
absorbs and improvises the shape of one's own work from the experience of
another media - it's also nice to just  return to the unabridged quiet
around the word and claim it as poetry - singular in and of itself.

Equally, as one might accept other kinds of artists - rich or poor - who are
delightfully challenged and happy staying inside the history and making of
their own chosen medium.

Sometimes - I accept - that might just be the way it is, poets included.

This thread seems to be developing two separate lives, one on Poetics and
the other (fuller) on Poetryetc.

Now if Roger Day could just "accidentally" cross-post to New Poetry, perhaps
Bob Grumman could get in on the act?

'A word is worth a thousand pictures.'

Each of Google and Yahoo returns a maximum of one thousand images per
search. Typically, any given word will indeed return a thousand images. And
it would surely take a thousand images to scope out (but not exhaust) the
visual 'meaning' of any given word.

Unfortunately I did not get to ask Richard Long  if he even reads Thomas
A. Clark - the Scottish poet who also examines remote landscapes in an
also rigorous fashion - though, different from Long,  Clark is much more
interested in the human implication of what he discovers on his walks.
Long, by the way, is quite insistent that his text pieces not be
confused with poems. The words he considers as "objects", not different
than individual stones or other natural items, and shape in which the
are printed on the paper correspond to shape of the walk or some aspect
of the terrain. The elegant portrayal of evidence - the printed works.


Long seems little different from his compatriot Fulton and from the
Americans Andre, Weiner and Kosuth, and the Japanese-American, On
Kaware, in his attitudes to poetry. All of them present texts as art,
and yet are insistent that those texts are not poetry. This is because
they think that if their texts are read as poetry they will be mis-read,
which indeed they would be if the poetry was that of Wordsworth, or of
many other kinds of poetry, including say the 'concrete poetry' of the
60s with which they were probably familiar. But it is true that they
tend not to know enough about the state of the art in their own times to
realise that there are links between their texts and those of some
contemporary poets. There is value to Long's view that words are
'objects' not different than stones or other natural items that would
not be lost on many contemporary poets--Clark Coolidge could be cited.
And it should be added that the procedural character of their texts:
esp. say Andre, Weiner and Long, links them to the procedural work of
MacLow and some Language poetry work. I think their texts can usefully
be read as poetry.

Thanks for these good connections, Wystan. It would,for example, be
interesting to know if Long was ever aware -  but how could he not be? - of
the Something Else Press anthology of concrete poets (Emmett Williams,
editor?) - that book did cross the line and was in museum shops everywhere -
including England -  in the sixties and early seventies (to the envy of us
small press publishers who could never get a poetry book across those crow
headed museum store buyers - even on with a cover by a well known artist!).

But the question is, I suspect, when does a 'text based work' by a poet (or
artist such as Weiner) get conferred as, say, "an object with an aura", that
befits an art collection - particularly something that can be framed and go
on a wall?  How much is the way one markets ones work, how much inventory of
such does it take for a gallerist, for example, to take it serious enough to
offer it a salable good? Why is Bob Grenier's text qua art work now sold in
a good New York gallery, and why is that of Tom Raworth (to my knowledge)
not so. Raworth's visual work is certainly equally interesting. But maybe
Tom has a total contempt for the art market(??).

But Long certainly figured it out early in relation to his text works. (I do
remember circa 1986 in Frankfurt seeing a Long book done as a book of poetry
by an English Press - actually I think I bought it for the equivalent of 10
dollars at most and now it is lost, gone - but it probably still available
in the book format for relatively cheap. But Long - by taking the work up
into a large print format of good type on fine papers - done in multiples
(?) I do not know - managed to create pieces that cast a material sense of
being in place with a walk. His "30 day walk" (to somewhere) that indicates
with arrows the direction(s) of the wind for each day is marvelous, as are
his maps. Other times - with say a mountain walk - I remember telling
myself, 'hokum - I'd rather be reading an early rip-rap poem by Gary Snyder
as much more tangible and 'real'.

I think part of Long's success has been to define his position within
certain limits and maximize what he does within those. (walks, circles,
lines, mud, etc.) He never, for example, makes more than one print of a
photograph. They sell for 30,000 dollars. The singularity - no multiples -
enables the work to be considered "art" rather than as a photography. He
does seem traditionally English - and financially smart - in this rigidity
of commitment. Tho the photographs can be astonishing, I'd think he'd rather
be walking and thinking, rather than making multiple prints).

Just as an aside, I think one of his most impressive works 'for sale' - done
by Lapis Press in the eighties - was a project where he went around the
world and made paper from maybe ten major rivers. A limited edition of 35
copies, he stenciled the name of the different river, "Amazon", for example,
on each river - all of whom created different colors of paper. Conceptually
and its realization, I thought it was a terrifically successful project.
Concrete poetry, indeed, at its best.

I'm sorry to say that Furniture Press will be closing its doors for a few m=
onths, until summer.=20

All pressing has stopped and all projects will be put on hold.=20

Personal responsibilities inhibit me from making any executive decisions at=
 this moment and prevent me from taking action, as far as readings, solicit=
ation and publishing go.

Our catalogue items are dwindling, and that's a good thing, so if anyone st=
ill wants copies of our books and chaps, feel free to check out the out-of-=
date site (again, it's not in my ability right now to be totally responsibl=
e...)

www.towson.edu/~cacasama/furniture/poae

everything will be discounted if you write me about what you want. I'm just=
 trying to clean house.

Also, Betsy Andrews, who did the first installment of the ongoing "New Jers=
ey" project with us as a limited edition screen-printed cardbook, has great=
 news:

"the full-length mss of "New Jersey" has won the Univ. of Wisconsin' Britti=

Check 'em out, not many left, and Sarah's beautiful prints are to die for! =

Thanks, everyone, again and again.

Looks like there's one opening in my workshop.  Preference given to
folks who are not currently enrolled in grad writing programs.
----------------

Dodie Bellamy's Prose Workshop

This spring I will be leading a prose workshop, which will meet 11
Wednesday evenings, from 7 to 10 p.m. The dates: February 8 through
April 26 (no class February 22). Cost: $350, with a $100 deposit due
by February 1.

By prose I mean fiction, nonfiction, prose poetry, cross-genre (and
cross-gender) writing including (but not exclusively) anything edgy
or experimental. It's a good place to present work that feels too
risky or sexy or queer for academic workshops. The workshops are
totally open-ended. Five people present a week, scheduling that the
week ahead. Usually people bring in something 5 pages or less (copies
for everybody) and we critique it that week. Longer pieces are also
okay, but they need to be handed out a week ahead of time for people
to read. Each student typically gets a half an hour each time we
critique. The classes are limited to 10 students. Lots and lots of
personal attention. They take place in my South of Market apartment,
which comes complete with snacks and one cat.

Pink Steam, my collection of fiction, memoir, and memoiresque essays,
was published in 2005 by San Francisco's Suspect Thoughts Press. My
vampire novel, The Letters of Mina Harker was reprinted by University
of Wisconsin Press, also in 2005. Academonia, a book of esays, is
forthcoming from Factory School.  I'm the author of 3 other books and
I teach creative writing at SF State and in the MFA program at
Antioch Los Angeles. I've also taught at CalArts, Naropa summer
session, Mills, USF, UC Santa Cruz, and the SF Art Institute. I'm the
winner of the Bay Guardian Goldie Award for Literature and the
Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about work samples, etc. Or--if
you know anybody who might be interested, please pass this email
along to them. If you're interested do contact me promptly.

If you know any undergrads at Brown who are looking for a fun course, tell
them to take electronic writing!  It's got a cool site, too, which can serve
as a resource for electronic writing courses elsewhere.

I missed meeting this fabulously learned gentleman, who died in a

Gertrude Stein's, and an accomplished poet in his own right.  He was up
on Cage, Mina Loy and the Baroness Elsa Freytag Von Loringhoven, yet his
work is hard to come by.  Hubbell's 1933 review of Lucy Church Amiably

own poetry is up at ahadadabooks thanks to the good graces of Yoko Danno
and Makoto Ozaki.  Go to: http://www.sendecki.com/ahadada/ and take a

Stephen,
        Thanks. I must try to get to see those Long books you mention. I =
can't say anything about his knowledge of concretepoetry--Emmet Williams =
links with Fluxus may not have helped its repute among Long and his =
contemporaries.And I am myself less interested in proposing an =
unknowledged link there--indeed it is the fact that the typographic is =
relatively less interesting to the artists I listed is that suggests the =
issue of the visuality of the text is lodged differently in their work.=20
        Issues of the market can confuse the question. Sculptors such as =
Andre, and Long, have always had objects to sell, and their  'aura' =
presumably attaches to the text pieces. On Kawara has long sold his as =
paintings.  Fulton on the other hand has only photos to sell and like =
most  contemporary art photographers has made them one-offs. Kosuth and =
Weiner are probably the most interesting in that their practice is more =
or less exclusively text-based--it hasn't been easy for them to build =
the aura for their  texts so as to bring them good money.  Neither are =
easy to collect, and both have produced a rich body of book works.=20
=20
        You say that for tangibility and realness you prefer early =
Snyder to Long's text works related to walks.=20
Doesn't that suggest a single standard?  What are the assumptions about =
language at work in these various text practices?  Does the answer to =
that help decide whether these artists can escape the charge of being =
poets?

Thanks for these good connections, Wystan. It would,for example, be
interesting to know if Long was ever aware -  but how could he not be? - =
of
the Something Else Press anthology of concrete poets (Emmett Williams,
editor?) - that book did cross the line and was in museum shops =
everywhere -
including England -  in the sixties and early seventies (to the envy of =
us
small press publishers who could never get a poetry book across those =
crow
headed museum store buyers - even on with a cover by a well known =
artist!).

But the question is, I suspect, when does a 'text based work' by a poet =
(or
artist such as Weiner) get conferred as, say, "an object with an aura", =
that
befits an art collection - particularly something that can be framed and =
go
on a wall?  How much is the way one markets ones work, how much =
inventory of
such does it take for a gallerist, for example, to take it serious =
enough to
offer it a salable good? Why is Bob Grenier's text qua art work now sold =
in
a good New York gallery, and why is that of Tom Raworth (to my =
knowledge)
not so. Raworth's visual work is certainly equally interesting. But =
maybe
Tom has a total contempt for the art market(??).

But Long certainly figured it out early in relation to his text works. =
(I do
remember circa 1986 in Frankfurt seeing a Long book done as a book of =
poetry
by an English Press - actually I think I bought it for the equivalent of =
10
dollars at most and now it is lost, gone - but it probably still =
available
in the book format for relatively cheap. But Long - by taking the work =
up
into a large print format of good type on fine papers - done in =
multiples
(?) I do not know - managed to create pieces that cast a material sense =
of
being in place with a walk. His "30 day walk" (to somewhere) that =
indicates
with arrows the direction(s) of the wind for each day is marvelous, as =
are
his maps. Other times - with say a mountain walk - I remember telling
myself, 'hokum - I'd rather be reading an early rip-rap poem by Gary =
Snyder
as much more tangible and 'real'.

I think part of Long's success has been to define his position within
certain limits and maximize what he does within those. (walks, circles,
lines, mud, etc.) He never, for example, makes more than one print of a
photograph. They sell for 30,000 dollars. The singularity - no multiples =
-
enables the work to be considered "art" rather than as a photography. He
does seem traditionally English - and financially smart - in this =
rigidity
of commitment. Tho the photographs can be astonishing, I'd think he'd =
rather
be walking and thinking, rather than making multiple prints).

Just as an aside, I think one of his most impressive works 'for sale' - =
done
by Lapis Press in the eighties - was a project where he went around the
world and made paper from maybe ten major rivers. A limited edition of =
35
copies, he stenciled the name of the different river, "Amazon", for =
example,
on each river - all of whom created different colors of paper. =
Conceptually
and its realization, I thought it was a terrifically successful project.
Concrete poetry, indeed, at its best.

valuable site, yes bill... one of the things that strikes me about
those artist links is how clear it is, generally, who has access to
serious institutional $$, and who doesn't... some of those linked
sites have been put together by real pros, others by people who are
still coding (like me) with html (and i understand, too, that some
folks prefer stripped-down presentations)...

i'm envious!... and i teach at a u, if one that can't afford to give
us anywhere near that kind of expert programming assistance... if i
want to rip a dvd and put it on my website, the best i can get is
someone to tell me over the phone what i need to do... then i have to
go and do it...

another problem here, too (and i know the electronic lit org is
working on this) is how to represent early storyspace, hypercard,
etc., works---which were the works that first caught my eye back in,
say, 1990... for that matter, the idea that net art could really
bolster collaboration---something i've always contended was the
case---has bumped up against that dollar reality too... in the past
4-5 years it's become increasingly evident to me that it often takes
serious $$ to collaborate---depends on the project, of course, but
have a look at any number of ongoing dvd projects---and the nation's
top 50 or so academic institutions are way, way ahead when it comes
to providing funding for such work...

collaboration is great, yeah, but it can be pricey...

best,

joe

The Contemporary Writers Series welcomes poet and performance artist, Bruce
Andrews for a rare West Coast reading at Mills College.

Tuesday, January 31, 2006, 5:30 p.m.
1st Floor Living Room, Mills Hall
Mills College
refreshments will be provided

Bruce Andrews is "a performance artist and poet whose texts are some of the
most radical of the Language school; his poetry tries to cast doubt on each
and every 'natural' construction of language" (The Oxford Companion to
Twentieth Century Literature in English).  Andrews is a founding editor of
the legendary journal L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE, which catalyzed the ep=
onymous poetry
movement that emerged in the 1970s and '80s.  His many books include Lip
Service (Coach House Books, 2001), Paradise and Method: Poetics and
Praxis(Avant-Garde and Modernism) (Northwestern University Press,
1996), Ex
Why Zee (Roof Books, 1995), and I Don't Have Any Paper So Shut Up (or,
Social Romanticism) (Sun & Moon Press, 1992).

I need to contact Heidi Staples. She is doing an interview for me with Medbh McGuckian for The Argotist Online. I have emailed her many time since December but I have had no response. This is unusual as she normally replies promptly. Does anyone know of her whereabouts? Is she alright?

collaboration and cash. i see your point (and i thought they were all
starving artists clicking away in sound-proof garrets).

actually, i had a similar thought scrolling through, but more along the
lines of design and distro protocols, costs and infrastructure
requirements for that. tho some, if you go all the way through, are
clearly not in that pro category, as you say.

Interesting list of artists, Brian. Here are some others who are seriously
involved in 'electronic writing':

JASON LEWIS (USA/Canada)
http://www.thethoughtshop.com
I particularly like his piece "I Know What You're Thinking".

EUGENIO TISSELLI (Spain)
http://www.motorhueso.net
Eugenio is an artist-programmer who has created an interesting body of
Shockwave work for the Web. Plus some other work in PHP and Visual Basic.
Some of Eugenio's work is exploratory of the 'semantic Web', ie, you type
something into the interface and the program then uses Google image search
or perhaps an online thesaurus or whatever to retrieve relevant data and
then does stuff with it. He also has some downloadable software online such
as MIDIPoet (done with Visual Basic) to create reactive text and image
pieces. And he has done some other strongly conceptual work in PHP where,
each time a Web page is visited, a character is deleted or generated or, in
another piece, a synonym replaces a word of the page--that is in a piece
titled "Philosophy of Language". Eugenio teaches at MECAD in Spain.

GREGORY WHITEHEAD (USA)
http://gregorywhitehead.com
http://www.ubu.com/sound/whitehead.html
http://vispo.com/temp/whitehead.m3u
Whitehead's work is literary audio work. His background is in theatre and
literary theory. He has been producing amazing audio work since the early
eighties.

CHRISTOPHE BRUNO (France)
http://www.iterature.com
I find Bruno's work inspired in its exploration of things like search
technology to "iterature". Be sure to check out the works linked toward the
bottom of the page such as "Epiphanies" and "Fields".

JOGCHEM NIEMANDSVERDRIET (Holland)
http://nobodyhere.com
This is a cohesive site. A synthesis of HTML works and Flash works. This
site is nobody's sorrow (which is what "niemandsverdriet" means).

JOE KEENAN (USA)
http://beehive.temporalimage.com/content_maps/42h.html
Joe doesn't have his own site set up, but I've admired this work, "Moment",
for some years.

JAKA ZELEZNIKAR (Slovenia)
http://www.jaka.org

THE WORD PROJECT (South Africa)
http://www.thewordproject.com
Visual poetry mostly in Flash. I ordered and read his book 'A Branch of
Wisdom', which is a pretty good novel.

STEVE DUFFY (UK)
http://www.debris.org.uk
HTML/DHTML related to, say, Ted Warnell's approach.

DAJUIN YAO (Taiwan)
http://www.sinologic.com/concrete
One of the only Taiwanese literary sites I know of.

MARKO NIEMI (Finland)
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/marniemi
Poet-programmer, translator, and editor.

JUKKA-PEKKA KERVINEN (Finland)
http://nonlinearpoetry.blogspot.com

DAVID KNOEBEL (USA)

What's electronic writing anyway?  Is it the same thing it was 5
years ago, 10 years ago, 25 years ago?  Aren't we really talking
about language-oriented interfaces?  All questions, no answers.

A fully linked version of this post appears at:

http://www.arras.net/brown_ewriting/

_What is Electronic Writing?_

I=92m asked this question quite often, and have rarely been able to come =
up
with a short answer. It=92s many things, and quite often, a work of
=93electronic writing=94 is so unique that it=92s a genre until itself.

If I were to come up with a fortune cookie answer to the question, I =
would
say that it is any form of writing that takes advantage of the =
possibilities
afforded by digital technology =96 such as the internet, or graphics =
programs
such as Illustrator or Photoshop, or animation / audio / interactive
programs such as Flash =96 in their creation and presentation.

But it is also those forms of writing that are informed by new ways of
thinking brought on by the way digital technology has impacted our =
world,
i.e. forms of writing that are organized according to the principles of =
the
database, or that work primarily as texts distributed over the internet, =
or
that =96 in the manner of =93Dispositions,=94 which was written with the =
aid of a
GPS device =96 relied on computer technology in the writing.

Now for the long answer=85 Electronic writing can be:=20

- Classic hypertext fiction, in which different pages of writing (often
called =93lexia=94) are maneuvered by the reader by clicking on words or =
images.
These can be =93choose your own adventure=94 type narratives, or more =
poetic
interactive texts in which there are no fictional elements at all. Many =
of
the better ones of these, such as =93Patchwork Girl=94 and =
=93Afternoon,=94 are not
available online, and have to be purchased from Eastgate Systems.=20

- Animated poems, such as =93The Dreamlife of Letters=94 or =
=93Axolotl,=94 in which
the viewer/reader is not asked to do anything but watch and listen while
text performs before them. Think of this as the art of movie titles =
applied
to creative ventures. =93Bembo=92s Zoo=94 is another classic example.=20

- Conceptual blogs and websites, such as =93The Dullest Blog in the =
World=94 or
=93Dagmar Chili Pitas,=94 which are sites that explore a particular type =
of
writing to the nth degree, such that you really can=92t categorize them =
under
anything in particular. =93Entropy8,=94 by Aurelia Harvey, is a classic =
in this
genre.=20

- Non-electronic conceptual writing, such as =93The Tapeworm Foundry=94 =
or
=93Dispositions,=94 that explore some aspect of writing that relates to =
a
=93database aesthetic,=94 i.e. a collection of fragments that are =
organized into
a poetic whole.=20

- Parody and =93hactivist=94 websites, which are conceptual sites that =
attempt
to comment on the conventions public communication on the web, such as
=93whitehouse.org,=94 my own =93Vaneigem Series,=94 or =93Blackness for =
Sale,=94 which
was really just a page of Ebay. These sites usually engage in some form =
of
artistic plagiarism, i.e. taking graphics and design elements from =
corporate
sites.=20

- Wordtoys, which are more sophisticated forms of classic hypertext, in
which the user is invited to play with an experimental interface is such =
a
way that new textual creations are manufactured in real-time, such as
Camille Utterback installation =93Text Rain=94 or the projects of Daniel =
Howe.=20

- Interactive Fiction and literary games, in which the user is the hero =
of a
story, and must input commands to navigate the literary piece and solve =
it
like a puzzle, in the manner of early text-playing or role-playing =
games.
Nick Montfort has been the biggest advocate of this type of writing.=20

- Cave Writing and installation texts, which takes place in the VRML
environment of Brown=92s Cave or in gallieries, like =93Text Rain=94 or =
=93Legible
City.=94 Some installations, such as Mark Domino=92s gl=E5s, are not =
interactive.=20

- Email and collaborative art, and other forms of writing that take
advantage of the forms of communication peculiar to electronic
communications, such as =93Implementation,=94 which is a fiction that =
requires
the user to download stickers that they can paste up in the cities or =
towns
they live in, or even writing that is primarily distributed via text
messaging.=20

- Computer generated texts, in which a computer program helped in the
creation of the text, or in which a web spider culled live text from the
internet to create the work, such as in Noah Wardrip-Fruin=92s =93Regime =
Change
& Newsreader.=94 A version of this is website translators like
=93Pornolize.com,=94 which converts the text of any website into a =
(kitchy) porn
language.=20

There are a billion variations on the above, and in fact no piece is =
ever
peculiar to one of these categories. A work called =93They Rule,=94 =
which uses a
database of CEOs of the major corporations of the world, is an =
interactive
political cartoon that is almost entirely a textual experience, while =
=93All
Your Base Are Belong to Us=94 is just a crazy Flash movie made by any =
number
of people spontaneously around the world.

Practical websites - such as ubu.com, a collection of concrete, audio =
and
avant-garde video files, and rhizome.org, the premiere internet website =
-
are often considered a form of art since they are often the expressions =
of
very personal, non-commercial and often very obsessive artistic and
political visions. Communities often develop around these sites, thus
putting them somewhere in the camp of =93activism.=94

Great electronic art can be created with little or no computer skills, =
which
is kind of the drama of the entire venture. Some of the most effective =
forms
of Electronic Writing are INCREDIBLY SIMPLE to create, such as =
=93Blackness
for Sale=94 and the =93Vaneigem Series.=94 I have a soft spot for these =
types of
projects, since they don=92t require a team of computer scientists to =
create,
and their impact is clean and immediate.

EVERY GOODBYE AIN’T GONE

An Anthology of Innovative Poetry
by African Americans

Edited by Aldon Lynn Nielsen
and Lauri Ramey

“Unquestionably an anthology whose time has come. . . . A critical
starting point from which literary historians and chroniclers of
African American expressive culture can begin to revise the current
accounting of black poetic experiment.”
—Meta DuEwa Jones, University of Texas at Austin

“With sensitivity, intelligence, and careful work, [the editors]
present a bumper crop of quite remarkable poetry!”
—Lorenzo Thomas, author of Extraordinary Measures: Afrocentric
Modernism and 20th-Century American Poetry

Every Goodbye Ain’t Gone presents the groundbreaking work of many of
the poets who carried on the innovative legacies of Melvin Tolson,
Gwendolyn Brooks, and Robert Hayden. Poetry by such key figures such
as Amiri Baraka, Tolson, Jayne Cortez, Clarence Major, and June Jordan
is represented alongside the work of less-studied poets such as
Russell Atkins, Jodi Braxton, David Henderson, Bob Kaufman, Stephen
Jonas, and Elouise Loftin.

Aldon Lynn Nielsen is Kelly Professor of American Literature at The
Pennsylvania State University and author of Integral Music: Languages
of African American Innovation. Lauri Ramey is Associate Professor of
English at California State University, Los Angeles, and author of
Black British Writing and Sea Change.

Thanks for all the great links, Jim.  And Gregory Whitehead is indeed a
great one for audio "electronic writing."  I'll put him up there, and maybe
Christophe Mignone. Only so much I can cram into the sidebar.

Chris Joseph is a real find, I wish I had known about him earlier, but it
appears he's only been working since 2002.  Still working through the rest
of the links.  Mark Tribe gave me a bunch of good ones too.

I agree that the loss of all of the Storyspace work for now is huge. I
really thought that I'd be able to teach some of that stuff, but it's so
awkward to get them to borrow copies from the library, read them in the lab
(where the software doesn't even run on the new Macs, from what I
understand) etc. I don't know why there is no Java version of Storyspace, it
seems like a no-brainer.  Then those students who didn't want to learn Flash
could just learn that.

As for funding for these projects, yes there is a difference between those
who can pay to have their stuff designed for them, but I actually find many
sites pretty, well, unbeautiful, even when there seems to be institutions
behind them.  It's when it comes to projecting your words on a wall and
dancing around in from of them with an electronic glove that it gets
expensive.  Most of the better looking web stuff tends to be by people who
make their money elsewhere anyway, with their own design sense unhindered by
other people's money.  A computer in itself is an investment, of course.

I encourage people to visit the blog, especially when student work starts to
go up, but please do me a favor and don't leave comments. The comments are
for them, and I'd like to make them feel like they have some privacy, even
though they know they don't.  (Feel free to comment at FSC however.)

Thanks again!
Brian

It may be that the work he currently has up is from 02 on, but he has been
at it for longer than that. I met him in 2001 and had seen quite a bit of
more literary work that he no longer has up on his site.

I wrote something about some of his work, recently, for a book to be
published in Britain concerning his work and the work of several others who
are doing experimental work with the moving image. There's a show of their
work touring Britain. I wrote about some of the work Chris has done that
draws on early cinema and its theory but recontextualized concerning Net
art.

  After I kill the President, the Boys come home from the desert. They're  thirsty, and it's not a liquid thirst. Sunshine repaints the windows  every morning around this time, but the Boys seem morose somehow:  they're waiting for something. They shovel hot new food into  themselves, wrapping their arms around their plates to insure proper  delivery.

  My hair dries out in the heat, so I have to condition--loudly. Tid-bits  of information dribble from the scimitar curl of their lips. Mary is  careful to point out the differences between data and information:  information is data in context. She learned this in school. Because I'm  suspicious of everything I've been taught, I appear not to listen.  Appear.

  I'm so fucking sick of words and definitions, of taxonomies and  discrimination. Mary is learning how to wander. The way is shocking  sometimes, in its method of detachment. The Boys, too, seem adroitly  adrift, as if, exhausting themselves akin to drowning, they'd drained  their personalities too. But Mary knows where we're going. The first  moment out of the shower, when the air hits you.

In that case, the 'electronic' part should, instead, be 'computer' or
'digital'. 'Electronic writing' can include work that doesn't have anything
to do with computers, such as Gregory Whitehead's audio work, or, much
earlier, William Burroughs's audio cut-ups, or Jenny Holzer's LED works.

In all fairness, what I do is more e-diting than e-writing, more
-editation than me-reme-diation, more publish than the e-parish of
current digi-praxis, so my camps are arguably elsewhere. Still,
e-diting as digital composition, book-making as computer-based
design-art, meta-organ-ization of the ur-book out of your-book... if
pushed I'd want to include these as e-writing formations, since they
are forms of writing that take advantage of the possibilities afforded
by digital technology and certainly graphics/design programs like Pshop
and InDesign, not to mention the Internet by which the many micro and
macro details of ur-book editation, production, distribution are
invented, managed, choreographed, and challenged. There are the
lingering issues of intent, investment, and output that I think could
be stressed a little more in definitions of e- or any other-writing,
the stamps of "e"-ness--or as a corollary, "print"-ness--that come from
the personal or institutional investments (of all kinds) inherent to
particular kinds of production and distribution, over the Internet or
elsewhere. Electronic writing is self-consciously so, and not to its
detriment by any means, and its capacities and limitations, as with
other forms, have more to do, I think, with "ways of thinking" than
with any structural reliance on computer technology. Dispositions, to
borrow the title, seem more to the point.

piedmont resident and all-around smart guy, has run the reading series
for three years.  See the article below.

FIVE STAR LATE LIFT EDITION
GET OUT; Pg. 7

Chapter and verse Schlafly, Duff's book returning pair of literary series.
By Daniel Durchholz

SPECIAL TO THE POST-DISPATCH

This month marks the return of two popular annual literary series: the
venerable River Styx at Duff's series, which begins its 31st year with a
program Sept. 19, and the relative upstart Readings @ the Schlafly Tap
Room, which begins at 8 tonight. If you don't recognize the latter's
name, that's because it has moved locations and changed names three
times in three years.

"We were at the City Museum the first year, and then we moved to the
Contemporary Art Museum," says poet and teacher Aaron Belz, who curates
the series. "This year we've hunkered down in the Club Room on the
second floor of the Schlafly brewery. It's really quite a nice room."

Despite its short history, the series has hosted a surprising number of
established poets, including Pulitzer Prize winner Carl Dennis and
National Book Critics Circle Award winner Rodney Jones.

"This year, we have some really well-established poets like Carl
Phillips and Jane Mead coming to read," Belz says. "We also have a lot
of younger and vital poets mixed in. Each season, about 75 percent of
the poets have been from out of town."

The series doesn't represent any one style, Belz says, though there may
be a slight emphasis on the avant-garde, which reflects his own taste.

"But I've really been quite willing to have all types of poets read," he
says. "Carl Phillips isn't at all avant-garde, but he's very well
respected. We're all over the place (stylistically)."

Some of the bills are put together with a bit of whimsy. One reading
scheduled for January features five writers, all of them named Aaron --
including Belz, who will emcee.

"Last year, we had a reading with three Stephanies, and it was a huge
success," he says. "For us, it's a huge success if there are 50 or 60
people in the audience. Last year, we averaged over 40 per reading,
which is very high for a poetry series."

The River Styx series, meanwhile, has been packing them in at Duff's for
decades.

"It's a great place to have the readings," says Richard Newman, who
edits the River Styx literary magazine, which just published its 30th
anniversary issue. "There's a bar, and Karen Duffy is almost religiously
devoted to the reading series. She's even been known to shut off the air
conditioner so there's no noise to distract from the poetry readings.
She actually did that once when she thought her own air conditioner was
too loud."

Each of the River Styx readings features two writers, usually one from
St. Louis and one from out of town. Among the luminaries reading this
year are novelist and essayist David Carkeet, women's collective Loosely
Identified and fiction writer Lee K. Abbott.

Newman says there's also interest in keeping the readings varied in
terms of formal concerns.

"There's going to be a mixture of poets or fiction writers or nonfiction
writers and performance artists," he says. "We've had playwrights a
couple times. We try to be lively and diverse. Those are the two
overriding mission words: lively and diverse."

Belz, meanwhile, maintains that his series' purpose is "to connect St.
Louis' writing culture with what's happening in the rest of the country.
I think we're doing that."

THE UNPERFORMABLE: THE VISUAL SIDE OF POETRY =E2=80=93 EVELYN REILLY
THURSDAYS at 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 16TH
=20
=E2=80=9CThe traditional notion of poetry as primarily a matter of =E2=80=9Cvoice=E2=80=9D ha=
s often
obscured its graphic and visual character, and can limit the range of
experiment to what can be experienced in the venue of the poetry reading.
Even the most performance-based poets, however, face issues of how to
spatialize their work on the page, and every line break is as much a visual
as a rhythmic and aural decision. This workshop will explore a broad range
of visual poetics =E2=80=94 from modernist innovations to composition-by-field to
recent spatialized text, concrete, collage, and digital poetry. We will
examine work by Mallarme, Apollinaire, cummings, Olson, Schwerner, Hak Kyun=
g
Cha, Aram Saroyan and Susan Howe, and peruse the UbuWeb site together.
Everyone will be encouraged to analyze the visual assumptions behind their
poems as well as to write or revise work using alternative visual
conventions.=E2=80=9D Evelyn Reilly=E2=80=99s book Hiatus was published by Barrow Stree=

re
the differences between knowledge and information, and what are we putting
into our poems? Why? We will look at poets & projects confronting these
questions & we will explore our own potential in navigating transitional
space (community, jobs, war, media). We may look at poems by Etel Adnan,
Ammiel Alcalay, Jules Boykoff, Ernesto Cardinal, Roque Dalton, Kevin Davies=

what we value, how to assess the values of any given poem. We may address
contradictions in literal or figurative yogic practice and the

nd
poets held dear mostly by other New York School Poets (Joe Ceravolo, Steve

SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 18TH

=E2=80=9CWe are making manuscripts of our work (at whatever stage the work or the
poet or both are). As poets we are also looking at and sometimes working
with prose, as another form of poetry, as well other forms of poetry such a=
s
lyrics, raps, spoken word form(ats) or even simple lines =E2=80=93 good in and of
themselves. We practice exercises and routines of the poet. We often listen
to the works of each other =E2=80=93 in progress. And there is always the right t=

Electronic, digital, computer do not indicate interconnectedness nor
hyperlinking which i would have thought was absolutely necessary to the =
new
literary activity brian is teaching.

Writing is suspect too as it has in the past referred to written text, =
tying
it down to only one system of interpretation, not allowing for image, =
moving
image, sound, voice, interactive elements, etc.

At the moment we all sort of know what electronic writing means.

I rather like cybertext, espen aarseth's definition.

'There is a tendency among hypertext theorists to call all electronic
texts hypertexts (and to call paper-based texts with paths or simi-
lar devices protohypertexts), but this sort of imperialist =
classification
is not useful, considering the wide variety of textual types (many
of which are already known by other names, such as MUDs and
adventure games). Hypertext is a useful term when applied to the
structures of links and nodes, but it is much less so if it includes
all other digital texts as well. I suggest the term cybertext for texts
that involve calculation in their production of scriptons.'

So for me a course called 'electronic writing' may be better named
'constructing cybertets'.

UN: U.S. ALIGNED WITH IRAN IN ANTI-GAY VOTE
Rice Must Explain Repressive UN Ban on LGBT Rights Groups

(Washington, D.C., January 25, 2006) - In a reversal of policy, the
United States on Monday backed an Iranian initiative to deny United
Nations consultative status to organizations working to protect the
rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. In a
letter to Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, a coalition of 40
organizations, led by the Human Rights Campaign, Human Rights Watch,
the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, and the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, called for an explanation of the
vote which aligned the United States with governments that have long
repressed the rights of sexual minorities.

Poet
Christine Stewart has this to say about it:=20

This season offers its coldest pronoun. In the year 2005, the human =
subject
is sold for oil, bound with fear and gagged with dumb longing.
=20
Shaw and Strang loosen the pronominal wire.  In COLD TRIP, the tragic =
lyric
is resung and unsung.  Repetition shifts the I's bind and the subject =
finds
relief in the civic wide surface of words =96 "each current/ will win =
me/ each
surface also." Each tilting word edge is the subject's end and its
agency=97the music of identity and its unraveling.  So, sing I thus, and =
in
the warmth of the possible and in the sorrow of the uncertainty, "the
glowing might be named."  (Christine Stewart)

peace cindy,

We restate our commitment to the peace process. But we will not submit to a process of humiliation."

"...we have the responsibility to make no deal with the oppressor"
--harry belafonte



i understand where you are coming from, however, the members of imc back
peddling and passing the buck, below have used the forum to launch
personal attacks, harass me and defame my character. they have basically
entered it not to produce independent media or "challenge the centres of
power" --  b.u.t. to infiltrate and control it like 90% of the media in
kkkanada (owned and operated by the kkkanadian government or the asper
family).  stephen karr/pepper (whose refrain is to remind us that his
ignorance, obsession, unilateral thinking and sociopathic manipulative
behaviour can be excused because of the amerikkkan racial and national
socialist party percentile law -- not black this time b.u.t. -- of
being  "1/4 jewish?") was actually a troll who spent much time lying,
launching personal attacks against *ytzhak*, defaming the character of
the poster, attacking and deleting latino posts and complying with the
racist segregationist policies of california immigration laws and
xenophobia and making false claims of *antisemiticism* (the new tools
for anyne who critiques or challenges the centres of power) along with
guamanian/dan bashaw with jim hedger/radhippie (supporter of ernst
zundle) and former member of the white boy only anachist club, as their
go boy shill -- some are lawyers now advising on how far they can push a
nigger legally without getting caught; some pretend to be journalists
for media monoplies.  most imc would find it odd that a troll would be
offered a position on the admin of the imc they have disrupted and
attack. then that very troll would, try and invoke choas on the site to
collapse it ad then encourage very threatening and affected/disturbed
persons to engage in internet harassment against a regular posters and
other peoples in order to discourage them from participating in local
and global affairs that contradict the white global supremacist and
elitist agenda.

any opportunity to make light of, humiliate and harass *ytzhak* or
lawrence ytzhak braithwaite,  the below imc coopterss have taken and it
has become, much to their schoolyard bullying pleasure, humiliating,
unfair, anti-intellectual, childish and intolerable -- form of
behvariorial modification -- which is the desired affect of harassment.
  it's not that that people are blind to the bad behavior of the white
bourjois in public b.u.t. that it is to make the situation so insane
that anyone reacting normally, to extreme confrontation and hyperbole,
with no jusitice or fairness/no checks and balances and with no outlet
-- then like a frustrated ghetto by from native son or a palestinian
bomber, thrower or matyre,  each seen taken out of contexte with no
knowledge of the history of opression, would toss themselves into the
mix like c k chesterton's description of art to *thursday* -- in a a
sudden act of desperation, -- so why should i be a fool for this?  this
city which has history of erasing and/ignoring the accomplishments of
nonwhites is so hell bent on cultural imperialism is has almost become
an inbred race or ethncity in itself.

i have never been offered the respect as a long time member of this
society here or of the community, despite my work to assist, or as an
author worthy of respect and as an asset. i remained always pushed to
the outside with a theatrical flair of making as if i was resisting an
invitaiton -- i was and am resisting tokenism & colonial labels.
frankly, i have been treated like uppity nigger that won't know his
place (or when that stranger called honesty and straight talk take hold
-- like an animal) .  if people disagreed with me on an intellectual
level that would be one thing -- b.u.t. it is reduced to slander,
bullying, defamation and humiliation tactics -- for like israel, and
it's brutality toward difference, they can't seem to make a case it or
any other their twisted idealogies. they can only build firewalls and
shoot of derision.  basically, i have been subjected to the old colonial
ritual of personal harassment -- my body violated, my accomplishments
the victim of benign neglect and driven to the point of despair by these
powers with the hope that i self destruct via negative reinforcement and
isolation.

i guess that's what you get when you are drafted, and i say drafted
because i do not prefess to be of greatness or noble calling, only a
simple man not a *boy* or anybody's *boy* as a supremist poster
refereners to me as, b.u.t. at times a bit ridiculous,  into fighting/or
starting a scene of two as lord attendant, for a noble cause/for my
peoples -- staggering in the footsteps with an increasingly heavying
backpack -- in the footsteps of bruhs/sis and ancestors -- more stronger
than i -- the tokenism and invisibility of our invincable
accomplishements in this city and what jay-z once reminded us, to get
people to "see what a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadsta"/or
nigga as an author -- to see ourselves -- from niggas to gods as bruh
akil once wrote.  to hear ourselves -- not the reflection tolerance of
the so called liberal british columbian society, a society that has an
agneda of making this a white dialogue -- be it left or right -- junkie
or str8 edge -- of separatist and one race caste system,  b.u.t. one of
as accomplished various individuals who have a right to  BEE seen,
respected and heard.

since i have been here whatever opportunity, on an increasing level, has
been take to degrade me -- to criminalize me to take me down a few
notches -- tokenize and label.  i have not been in the least bit
respected or publicly acknowledge as an asset to my community - to my
city. i have served this country for 11 years of my life. i have studied
the classics. i wrote what has been acknowledge as cult classic in the
united states. both novels have had featured reviews and praises from
the alterntive to mainstream presses, outside of victoria. i was the
first kkkanadian to have been signed to much saught after press. my
writngs have been included in the national poetry archieves, studied at
grad level in university. i have worked with food not bombs, put
together a zine of black, native and muslim knowledge and revolutionary
thought (mw), made chapbooks illustrated wby local artists. my
recordings and writing have been heard and published, respectively,
internationally.  my hope and struggle has always been for new
palestine. i have struggled for my community and faught and turned down
opportunities in both the u.s. and kkkanada who have attempted to
disrespect the peoples here and my fam and peoples in general --
compromise our integrity = "i am we".   and have always acknowledged
being from victoria and not the more glamourous big city of vancouver,
like so many other artist have attempted to do, and all these efforts
have garndered is benign neglect, brutality and/or constant humilation
(to every step in my elevation which, will, god willing, remain
constant),  and in the case of certain city privately contracted
individuals, like an animal who won't down stay. ...and by some
coincidence i'm am suppose to ignor, or we are, that all this has
happened to, and is happening to, the first black author of british
columbia. one not treated as a prize. ...not as human b.u.t.  as being
killed by willful destruction.  i must admit, i have been foolish, in my
obession over making this city and my hood feel and think and CEE.
...for i have, openly, in a covert manner, said, not worship or adore --
not even more importantly, like, maybe -- b.u.t. 'love me'.

...and all smirked all the way.

b.u.t i know that...

b.u.t. i grow tired...

...and my backpack, visible or not, gets heavier

kkkanadian towns have always had a history of, not only institutional,
b.u.t. local citizenry collective racism, harassment and complicity in
the rapes, murders and other wilful destruction of humnanbeings
undesired/'not wanted on the journey' by the static quo -- be they
natives, poor, black and now muslims and arabs - one might say that
kkkanada comes into it's own or collapses, for maybe 'colonialism time
has come to an end', as the nwo makes a power move on the world -- for
no two have anything more in common for the sadistic bullying, cold
kills, bought journalist monopolies on truth, worship of mediocrity, and
utter disregard for the individual and human values of difference and
varying cultures and voices.

imc's were created and fought in attempt to bring truth to the people
and combat the lies of the mainstream cooped media.  it then became an
outlet for creativity for those on the outskirts or rejecting mainstream
corporate arts -- BEE it hip hop, punk, rap, turntablism, literature,
poetry or creative non-fiction or film and video.  it was not, however,
ever meant to be a forum for failed peoples to place themselves as admin
or editors and engage and provoke harassment  and humiliation of
individuals who do ntot stroll with the party line -- nor was it meant
to be a lackey to brutal, apartheid regimes, totalitarian governments,
dysfunctional racist individuals and corporate whores. in the case of
victoria.indymedia.org, it has fallen victim to to the spooks of planted
seeds of kkkanadian imperialism and media same think unthink tank
totalitARYANism and showboaters.

in a town with aryan nation groups, fascists separatists electoral
parties, paranoid white folk training grounds, a gay community loyal to
corporate and white power causes, mercenaries and supremacist gangs
...they say the trouble and threat to freedome and what must be faught
and degraded for the safety of jews and even homosexuals, lies in
combating one of the victims of these totalitarianism groups since his
arrival -- the black author lawrence ytzhak braithwaite. ...and as good
hypocracy, the sort this country breeds in the very genes of it's
system, it is done with the stance of fighting against the oppression of
now oppressive groups = *homophobia* and now *antijewish* sentiments and
the new heretical religion of *holocaust deniel* i.e. hiding behind
white european jewish struggle (where if any negative comments were made
against these two groups, and new born religion, would have been deleted
within minutes) all of whom who having forgotten the solidarity that got
them here - or what it is like to be treated cruely by what was once the
opressors,  have decided to join the daemon's cacophony of destruction
of enlightment for the dark ages of fear and ignorance,  as bedfellows.

nigger go home.

...and bruthas got the shout down of *let the niggers burn*

my body and life in this place is the witness, inshallah.

if something should happen to me (and it scares to say it shall) --
remember not only these names and it's history and pracitices b.u.t.
remember the city and it's habits and plants, inshallah.

one day we will be, inshallah

peace

notes from new palestine: niggers can never go home again. -- Hey Jim --
Please Call Home!



We restate our commitment to the peace process. But we will not submit
to a process of humiliation."
--patrick o'neil

"...we have the responsibility to make no deal with the oppressor"
--harry belafonte



do you overstand where we are coming from?

the members of imc back peddling and passing the buck, over the
seriousness of lessez faire racism and personal harassment of posters,
to imc and local authors have used the forum to launch personal attacks,
harass and defame character. they have basically entered it not to
produce independent media or "challenge the centres of power" --  b.u.t.
to infiltrate and control it like 90% of the media in kkkanada (owned
and operated by the kkkanadian government or the asper family).  stephen
karr/pepper (whose refrain is to remind us that his ignorance,
obsession, unilateral thinking and sociopathic manipulative behaviour
can be excused because of the amerikkkan racial and national
socialist party percentile law -- not black, as far as the amerikkkan
goes, this time b.u.t. -- of  being  "1/4 jewish?") was actually a troll
who spent much time lying, launching personal attacks against *ytzhak*,
defaming the character of the poster, attacking and deleting latino
posts and complying with the racist segregationist policies of
california immigration laws and xenophobia and making false claims of
*antisemiticism* (the new tools for anyne who critiques or challenges
the centres of power) along with guamanian/dan bashaw with jim
hedger/radhippie (supporter of ernst zundle) and former member of the
white boy only anachist club, as their go boy shill -- some are lawyers
now advising on how far they can push a nigger legally without getting
caught; some pretend to be journalists for media monoplies.  most imc
would find it odd that a troll would be offered a position on the admin
of the imc they have disrupted and attacked. then that very troll would,
try and invoke choas on the site to collapse it and then encourage very
threatening and affected/disturbed persons to engage in internet
harassment against a regular poster and other peoples in order to
discourage them from participating in local and global affairs that
contradict the white global supremacist and elitist agenda.

any opportunity to make light of, humiliate and harass *ytzhak* or
lawrence ytzhak braithwaite, the below imc coopters have taken and it
has become, much to their schoolyard bullying pleasure, humiliating,
unfair, anti-intellectual, childish and intolerable -- a form of
behvariorial modification -- which is the desired affect of harassment.
it's not that people are blind to the bad behavior of the white
bourjois in public b.u.t. that it is to make the situation so insane
that anyone reacting normally, to extreme confrontation and hyperbole,
with no jusitice or fairness/no checks and balances and with no outlet
-- then like a frustrated ghetto boy from native son or a palestinian
bomber, thrower or matyre,  each seen taken out of contexte with no
knowledge of the history of oppression, would toss themselves into the
mix like c k chesterton's description of art to *thursday* -- in a
sudden act of desperation, -- so why should i be a fool for this?  this
city which has history of erasing and/ignoring the accomplishments of
nonwhites is so hell bent on cultural imperialism it has almost become
an inbred race or ethncity in itself.

i have never been offered the respect as a long time member of this
society here or of the community, despite my work to assist, or as an
author worthy of respect and as an asset. i remained always pushed to
the outside with a theatrical flair of making as if i was resisting an
invitation -- i was and am resisting tokenism & colonial labels.
frankly, i have been treated like an uppity nigger that won't know his
place (or when that stranger called honesty and straight talk take hold
-- like an animal) .  if people disagreed with me on an intellectual
level that would be one thing -- b.u.t. it is reduced to slander,
bullying, defamation and humiliation tactics -- for like israel, and
it's brutality toward difference, they can't seem to make a case for it
or any other their twisted idealogies. they can only build firewalls and
shoot of derision.  basically, i have been subjected to the old colonial
ritual of personal harassment -- my body violated, my accomplishments
the victim of benign neglect and driven to the point of despair by these
powers with the hope that i self destruct via negative reinforcement and
isolation.

i guess that's what you get when you are drafted, and i say drafted
because i do not prefess to be of greatness or noble calling, only a
simple man not a *boy* or anybody's *boy* as a supremist poster
refereners to me as, b.u.t. at times a bit ridiculous,  into fighting/or
starting a scene of two as lord attendant, for a noble cause/for my
peoples -- staggering in the footsteps with an increasingly heavying
backpack -- in the footsteps of bruhs/sis and ancestors -- more stronger
than i -- the tokenism and invisibility of our invincable
accomplishements in this city and what jay-z once reminded us, to get
people to "see what a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadsta"/or
nigga as an author -- to see ourselves -- from niggas to gods as bruh
akil once wrote.  to hear ourselves -- not the reflection tolerance of
the so called liberal british columbian society, a society that has an
agenda of making this a white dialogue -- be it left or right -- junkie
or str8 edge -- of separatist and one race caste system,  b.u.t. one of
as accomplished various individuals who have a right to  BEE seen,
respected and heard.

since i have been here whatever opportunity, on an increasing level, has
been taken to degrade me -- to criminalize me, to take me down a few
notches -- tokenize and label.  i have not been in the least bit
respected or publicly acknowledge as an asset to my community - to my
city. i have served this country for 11 years of my life. i have studied
the classics. i wrote what has been acknowledge as cult classic in the
united states. both novels have had featured reviews and praises from
the alterntive to mainstream presses, outside of victoria. i was the
first kkkanadian to have been signed to much saught after press. my
writngs have been included in the national poetry archieves, studied at
grad level in university. i have worked with food not bombs, put
together a zine of black, native and muslim knowledge and revolutionary
thought (mw), made chapbooks illustrated by local artists. my
recordings and writing have been heard and published, respectively,
internationally.  my hope and struggle has always been for new
palestine. i have struggled for my community and faught and turned down
opportunities in both the u.s. and kkkanada who have attempted to
disrespect the peoples here and my fam and peoples in general --
compromise our integrity = "i am we".   and have always acknowledged
being from victoria and not the more glamourous big city of vancouver,
like so many other artist have attempted to do, and all these efforts
have garndered is benign neglect, brutality and/or constant humilation
(to every step in my elevation which, will, god willing, remain
constant),  and in the case of certain city privately contracted
individuals, like an animal who won't down stay. ...and by some
coincidence i'm am suppose to ignor, or we are, that all this has
happened to, and is happening to, the first black author of british
columbia. one not treated as a prize. ...not as human b.u.t.  as being
killed by willful destruction.  i must admit, i have been foolish, in my
obession over making this city and my hood feel and think and CEE.
...for i have, openly, in a covert manner, said, not worship or adore --
not even more importantly, like, maybe -- b.u.t. 'love me'.

...and all smirked all the way.

b.u.t i know that...

b.u.t. i grow tired...

...and my backpack, visible or not, gets heavier

kkkanadian towns have always had a history of, not only institutional,
b.u.t. local citizenry collective racism, harassment and complicity in
the rapes, murders and other wilful destruction of humnanbeings
undesired/'not wanted on the journey' by the static quo -- be they
natives, poor, black and now muslims and arabs - one might say that
kkkanada comes into it's own or collapses, for maybe it is what
ahmadinejad has said, 'colonialism time
has come to an end', as the nwo makes a power move on the world -- for
no two have anything more in common for the sadistic bullying, cold
kills, bought journalist monopolies on truth, worship of mediocrity, and
utter disregard for the individual and human values of difference and
varying cultures and voices.

imc's were created and fought for in an attempt to bring truth to the
people
and combat the lies of the mainstream coopted media.  it then became an
outlet for creativity for those on the outskirts or rejecting mainstream
corporate arts -- BEE it hip hop, punk, rap, turntablism, literature,
poetry or creative non-fiction or film and video.  it was not, however,
ever meant to be a forum for failed peoples to place themselves as admin
or editors and engage and provoke harassment  and humiliation of
individuals who do not stroll with the party line -- nor was it meant
to be a lackey to brutal, apartheid regimes, totalitarian governments,
dysfunctional racist individuals and corporate whores. in the case of
victoria.indymedia.org, it has fallen victim to to the spooks of planted
seeds of kkkanadian imperialism and media same think unthink tank
totalitARYANism and showboaters.

in a town with aryan nation groups, fascists separatists electoral
parties, paranoid white folk training grounds, a gay community loyal to
corporate and white power causes, mercenaries and supremacist gangs
...they say the trouble and threat to freedome and what must be faught
and degraded for the safety of jews and even homosexuals, lies in
combating one of the victims of these totalitarianism groups since his
arrival -- the black author lawrence ytzhak braithwaite. ...and as good
hypocracy, the sort this country breeds in the very genes of it's
system, it is done with the stance of fighting against the oppression of
now oppressive groups = *homophobia* and now *antijewish* sentiments and
the new heretical religion of *holocaust deniel* i.e. hiding behind
white european jewish struggle (where if any negative comments were made
against these two groups, and new born religion, would have been deleted
within minutes) all of whom who having forgotten the solidarity that got
them here - or what it is like to be treated cruely by what was once the
opressors,  have decided to join the daemon's cacophony of destruction
of enlightment for the dark ages of fear and ignorance, as bedfellows.

nigger go home.

...and bruthas got the shout down of *let the niggers burn*

my body and life in this place is the witness, inshallah.

if something should happen to me (and it scares to say it shall) --
remember not only these names and it's history and pracitices b.u.t.

Do any of you have links to some really good examples of electronic writing?

I think examples of people doing it well will help me get the idea better
than attempted definitions/descriptions.

thanks

Just made my way thru Tom Clark's made-for-TV biography of Olson &
finished the book feeling unfulfilled.  Surely there must be other
Olson biographical sources out there that do a more thorough job of
taking the reader thru the Maximus Poems & how the big guy lived it.
Kept feeling like Clark would begin to reference MP time & again,
starting to make some connections but then quickly give way to the
misunderstood genius / tortured lover subtext.  I know of Butterick's
sourcework which I haven't read.  Is that something that's readable
or is it a giant footnote?  Anything else essential that I'm missing,
I mean I know there's a lot out there, how to sort thru it?  Also, I
know there are a more than a few OlsonHeads listening, is the 95
University of CA edition of Maximus, the final version, the one to read?

When I think of electronic writing I think of hypertext (html) and news tic=
kers on building and what appears in those old word processor windows that =
shows the text before it's actually printed. I think there's more but my co=
nception of electronic writing is anything (words) that appear on an electr=
onic surface. I don't think printing a document from a Word file should be =
considered electronic writing, but the word document "as it's being process=
ed on the screen" is electronic writing.=20

How about: something that can be manipulated electronically in real time?

i sort of hate that book.  i found if for next to nothing (less than
$1) before i had really read much Olson and read it and it really
poisoned me wrt to his work.  it took a number of years before i it had
faded enough from my mind to approach O without it getting in the way.

so i wd also be interested in hearing of any better bio work on O

In light of the recent discussion about e/digital/computer
writing/texts/objects, the following CFP might interest some of you:

+ Writing the Machine: Materiality, Intentionality & the Digital Poem
+ Call for Papers: MLA Special Session
+ Annual Meeting December 27-30th 2006 (Philadelphia)

What's at issue in this panel is the relation between machine / human,
intentionality / intentionlessness in digital textuality.  More
particularly, papers could enact close-readings of digital poems using
well-known theorists such as Gerald Bruns, Michael Davidson, Johanna
Drucker, Susan Howe, Jerome McGann, and Marjorie Perloff -- all of
whom have long been engaged with the ways in which materiality, of the
word, the text, the page, provides insight into authorial intent.
Papers could also draw from Walter Benn Michaels as a theorist of the
material as he explicitly separates an interest with materiality from
an interest in authorial intention, claiming that contemporary writing
mistakenly pits the one against the other.

Please send 500-word proposals with a paper-title and a brief CV to
Lori Emerson, lemerson@buffalo.edu, by March 1st 2006.

mIEKAL,

1) Yes and Yes.
2) Yes
3) Yes

I think Tom Clark was trying to do a hatchet job and I know several
people would not even talk to him. McClure and Joanne Kyger I think
among them. Funny thing about hatchet jobs, they often make the hatchet
man look stupid while the subject's field does not seem to suffer
damage, but continues to radiate off the pages.

1) Butterick's guide is necessary, but is a giant footnote. Would LOVE
to see the whole thing in hypertext someday.
(http://www.uncg.edu/eng/pound/canto.htm is an example, though I
remember seeing one mcuh better looking years ago.)

2) Sherman Paul - "Olson's Push."
Robert Von Hallberg - "Charles Olson - The Scholar's Art"
Shahar Bram - "Charles Olson and Alfred North Whithead: An Essay on Poetry."
Paul Christiensen - "Charles Olson: Call Him Ishmael"
Robin Blaser - "The Violets: A Cosmological Reading of a Cosmology"
http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2534
David Saffo - "Charles Olson, Martin Heidegger, and Ontic Immediacy: a
Phenomenological Interpretation of poem-in-the-world"
http://www.h-ngm-n.com/

These are a few relevant sources. I have recently been studying Olson
and have two essays I've just finished:
*"*Dualism and Olsonian/Whiteheadian Process"
http://www.globalvoicesradio.org/Dualism_and_Olsonian.htm
and "The Sound of the Field"
http://www.globalvoicesradio.org/The_Sound_of_the_Field_(1.19.06).htm

The Bram book and the Blaser essay are the most satisfying for me. I
think Olson's process, sourced in the cosmology of Whitehead, is his
most critical achievement. Bram investigates the aspects of Whitehead's
"stance toward reality" which Olson ran with and used to create a
cosmology which is his poetics. This is huge. Here are some salient
points from Bram:

    * “…poetry is not a poem: the name of an object, a finished
      aesthetic object, the outcome of a process is negligible. Rather,
      the poem is poesis; the process of creation and the poem are, at
      most, two names or two perspectives for contemplating the same
      activity, the creativity of a human being in the world” (12);

    * “Olson argues that Whitehead ‘only refines and corrects the most
      ancient myth-cosmos’” and “Olson’s poetic act constitutes a
      critique of prevailing norms and a proposal for an alternative
      ethos, which he actualized as a poetics. The poem is an act and a
      call to act, the building of a new (re-newed) identity for the
      individual and the community” (12);

    * “every place, according to Olson, is an opening place, and can
      serve as a gate inward that can be used to return outward, after
      further growth. (14); and most importantly:

    * “Olson does not adopt the scientific worldview and its concepts
      metaphorically” (15). This last point can’t be understated, and
      Olson may have been TOO committed to process. Much of The Maximus
      Poems turns out to be field notes and jottings which, for other
      poets, would be not more than material for new poems. Olson leaves
      them all in so his process is completely transparent and Bram
      concludes his introduction with the notion that The Maximus Poems
      has “an acute sense of failure in the concluding section of the
      poem” (17). (In the Blaser essay he says Olson felt he needed
      another ten years.)

And 3) I am using the TMP edition you cite, tho waterlogged at the
Tibetan Bon workshop on Wickaninnish Island in Clayoquot Sound last year
in the torrent.

**That should get you going.

Paul

I highly recommend Charles Boer's memoir _Olson in
Connecticut_, about the very last phase of O's life,
with flashbacks to the Buffalo days.

mIEKAL:

Great summary by Paul Nelson. I'd also add that it seems essential to me to
read the correspondence between Olson & Creeley, published by Black Sparrow
Press in 10 volumes. Maybe not to read all of it, but make your way through
the first few volumes at least and see if you want more from there. Also,
Charles Olson and Frances Boldereff: A Modern Correspondence, is well worth
the time. Other letters, such as Letters for Origin, are worth your time as
well. Here are a couple of other titles:

Ann Charters, Olson/Melville: A Study in Affinity
Richard Grossinger, ed., An Olson-Melville Sourcebook (two volumes)
Don Byrd, Charles Olson's Maximus

Olson's own memoir of his father, The Post Office, is also worth reading.

For accuracy, and because it's in print, yes, the U California edition of
Maximus is essential. I prefer to read the earlier volumes, though, which
were published separately.

         The Maximus Poems (Jargon/Corinth, 1960)
         Maximus Poems IV, V, VI (Cape Golliard/Grossman, 1968)
         The Maximus Poems Volume Three (ed. by Charles Boer and George
Butterick, Grossman, 1975)

I know these aren't as inclusive or accurate in some ways, but they give
more sense of the scale of the work, and even though the last two are
oversized, they are more easily handled than the big complete version.
There is also a sense, in the physical presentation of those books, of work
that is in some ways still discovering, and at risk. Those books, even the
look and feel of them, probably contributed to my excitement about Olson
and Maximus when I first delved into them. Unfortunately, you may not be
able to find those volumes anywhere, except in libraries. The Univ. of
California Press book, while I welcome it, does not convey such a sense of
wonder.

Here is a poem I wrote yesterday after reading a new/recent book poems by John
Coletti called "Physical Kind." The book is published by Portable Press, edited
by Brenda Iijima and Erica Kaufman.


NO SUCH POEM for John Coletti

John, hug "like a quilt truck."
On the roof "Cooing a page
/in the twilight."
You send me to Joe Ceravolo,
John Godfrey, Clark Coolidge, Jack Collom:
Middle weights of old—-heavies all.
Names, names, names. How can I
describe their one-syllable dash.
A long history of no apology
/and no story.
I know if you knew, you'd take us—-
I know that. As you do, and do.
You don't say, "You don't say."
Nor I don't want to live like a story.
A translucent brown floor-dust
is there for you to see, sweep,
blow away, note by slow dusty note.
No shit, yes; "someone stole."
JC enters the ring: it's war, it's peace—
/Leo T. to a T.
Ted and Ted G. are in the corner,
/your cut men.
Curly hair Coletti, measured eyes, measured
/lips—-and the measure of a moan.
All the silent bruises I have ever loved,
the "emotional surface" scratched and gone too.
No one asking if it's a flood.

Ralph Maud's CHARLES OLSON'S READING: A BIOGRAPHY is amazingly good --
indeed I think it's exemplary. Traces connections, opens up the work, pays
attention to what Olson is actually up to. Essential, and definitely NOT a
footnote. And, hey, it's well-written as well as resourceful.

Just made my way thru Tom Clark's made-for-TV biography of Olson &
finished the book feeling unfulfilled.  Surely there must be other
Olson biographical sources out there that do a more thorough job of
taking the reader thru the Maximus Poems & how the big guy lived it.
Kept feeling like Clark would begin to reference MP time & again,
starting to make some connections but then quickly give way to the
misunderstood genius / tortured lover subtext.  I know of Butterick's
sourcework which I haven't read.  Is that something that's readable
or is it a giant footnote?  Anything else essential that I'm missing,
I mean I know there's a lot out there, how to sort thru it?  Also, I
know there are a more than a few OlsonHeads listening, is the 95
University of CA edition of Maximus, the final version, the one to read?

  http://www.miporadio.com/

  Or if you prefer to listen from ODEO:

  http://www.odeo.com/audio/633334/


  Thank you,
  Didi Menendez and Amy King
  www.miporadio.com


  The poems are from his most recent collect, "You Never Know" (Coffee House Press):


    "Ron Padgett makes the most quiet and sensible of feelings a provocatively persistent wonder. You never know what he'll think of next!"     -Robert Creeley


  "These 'late' poems of Ron Padgett have the clearness, the small sadness, and the big space of Guillaume Apollinaire, one of the many French writers he has translated into English. They are like a glass of transparent Vittel water held against the sky of Paris. 'I am forty-nine years old and surrounded by death. Does writing help? Probably not,' he writes in a poem about a friend who has since died. But Ron's writing helps us. Enormously."    -John Ashbery


  "A Padgett classic. He has, with obvious premeditation and pleasure, employed his most characteristic "tricks" to produce a deep, funny book. The poet makes superlative use of the directive writing consciousness -- often automatic pilot -- to tap the unconscious for memory, vision, emotion, and the unexpected and indefinable. The poems speak backwards and forwards in time, to self, to family and friends, to poetic technique, to the birds caged in the chest. It is so lovely."   -Alice Notley


  "Is there another American poet who could make us stop and wonder why woodpeckers don't get headaches? Could anyone else do a better job of evoking the small, tactile pleasures of sweeping up dust with a cornstraw broom? The Ron Padgett of yore is still with us-as charming, unpretentious, and surprising as ever-but there is a new Ron Padgett in this book as well: a poet of heart-breaking tenderness and ever-deepening wisdom. In You Never Know, he has become a chronicler of mortality, an elegist of worlds that vanish before our eyes."    -Paul Auster


  "Ron Padgett's poems sing with absolutely true pitch. And they are human friendly. Their search for truths, both small and large, can be cause for laughter, or at least a thoughtful sigh. You Never Know is a delightful antidote to anything pretentious. There poems are agile and lucid and glad to be alive. It's a pleasure to recommend them."

difficult decision.



If someone were willing and able to carry on, I would consider selling

Wegway back issues plus the "clip art" data cd



I am available to help with the transition and willing to remain in an

Perhaps this unfortunate turn of events will be someone's golden
opportunity.

I second all this, and add Chuck Stein's Secret of the Black
Chrysanthemum, about Olson and Jung.

It would be nice to have a bio that didn't portray the man as a
hopeless depressive (at best).

notes from new palestine: niggers can never go home again.


kkkanadian towns have always had a history of, not only institutional,
b.u.t. local citizenry collective racism, harassment and complicity in
the rapes, murders and other wilful destruction of humnanbeings
undesired/'not wanted on the journey' by the static quo -- be they
natives, poor, black and now muslims and arabs - one might say that
kkkanada comes into it's own or collapses, for maybe it is what
ahmadinejad has said, 'colonialism time has come to an end', as the nwo
makes a power move on the world -....


notes from new palestine: niggers can never go home again. -- Hey Jim --
Please Call Home!


“stop sweet-talking him. tell him how you feel. tell him how -- what
kind of hell you've been catching, and let him know that if he's ready
to clean his house up, if he's not ready to clean his house up, he
shouldn't have a house. it should catch on fire and burn down. “-- al
hajj malik shabaaz

We restate our commitment to the peace process. But we will not submit
to a process of humiliation."
--patrick o'neil

"...we have the responsibility to make no deal with the oppressor"
--harry belafonte

do you overstand where we are coming from?

the members of imc back peddling and passing the buck, over the
seriousness of lessez faire racism and personal harassment of posters,
to imc and local authors have used the forum to launch personal attacks,
harass and defame character. they have basically entered it not to
produce independent media or "challenge the centres of power" -- b.u.t.
to infiltrate and control it like 90% of the media in kkkanada (owned
and operated by the kkkanadian government or the asper family). stephen
karr/pepper (whose refrain is to remind us that his ignorance,
obsession, unilateral thinking and sociopathic manipulative behaviour
can be excused because of the amerikkkan racial and national
socialist party percentile law -- not black, as far as the amerikkkan
goes, this time b.u.t. -- of being "1/4 jewish?") was actually a troll
who spent much time lying, launching personal attacks against *ytzhak*,
defaming the character of the poster, attacking and deleting latino
posts and complying with the racist segregationist policies of
california immigration laws and xenophobia and making false claims of
*antisemiticism* (the new tools for anyne who critiques or challenges
the centres of power) along with guamanian/dan bashaw with jim
hedger/radhippie (supporter of ernst zundle) and former member of the
white boy only anachist club, as their go boy shill -- some are lawyers
now advising on how far they can push a nigger legally without getting
caught; some pretend to be journalists for media monoplies. most imc
would find it odd that a troll would be offered a position on the admin
of the imc they have disrupted and attacked. then that very troll would,
try and invoke choas on the site to collapse it and then encourage very
threatening and affected/disturbed persons to engage in internet
harassment against a regular poster and other peoples in order to
discourage them from participating in local and global affairs that
contradict the white global supremacist and elitist agenda.

any opportunity to make light of, humiliate and harass *ytzhak* or
lawrence ytzhak braithwaite, the above imc coopters have taken and it
has become, much to their schoolyard bullying pleasure, humiliating,
unfair, anti-intellectual, childish and intolerable -- a form of
behvariorial modification -- which is the desired affect of harassment.
it's not that people are blind to the bad behavior of the white
bourjois in public b.u.t. that it is to make the situation so insane
that anyone reacting normally, to extreme confrontation and hyperbole,
with no jusitice or fairness/no checks and balances and with no outlet
-- then like a frustrated ghetto boy from native son or a palestinian
bomber, thrower or matyre, each seen/taken out of contexte with no
knowledge of the history of oppression, would toss themselves into the
mix like c k chesterton's description of art to *thursday* -- in a
sudden act of desperation --

so why should i be a fool for this?

this city which has history of erasing and/ignoring the accomplishments
of nonwhites and the poor is so hell bent on cultural imperialism it has
almost become an inbred race or ethncity in itself.

i have never been offered the respect as a long time member of this
society here or of the community, despite my work to assist, or as an
author worthy of respect and as an asset. i remained always pushed to
the outside with a theatrical flair of making as if i was resisting an
invitation -- i was and am resisting tokenism & colonial labels.
frankly, i have been treated like an uppity nigger that won't know his
place (or when that stranger called honesty and straight talk take hold
-- like an animal) . if people disagreed with me on an intellectual
level that would be one thing -- b.u.t. it is reduced to slander,
bullying, defamation and humiliation tactics -- for like israel, and
it's brutality toward difference, they can't seem to make a case for it or
any other their twisted idealogies. they can only build firewalls and
shoot off derision. basically, i have been subjected to the old colonial
ritual of personal harassment -- my body violated, my accomplishments
the victim of benign neglect and driven to the point of despair by these
powers with the hope that i self destruct via negative reinforcement and
isolation.

i guess that's what you get when you are drafted, and i say drafted
because i do not prefess to be of greatness or noble calling, only a
simple man not a *boy* or anybody's *boy* as a supremist poster
refereners to me as, b.u.t. at times a bit ridiculous, into fighting/or
starting a scene of two as lord attendant, for a noble cause/for my
peoples -- staggering in the footsteps with an increasingly heavying
backpack -- in the footsteps of bruhs/sis and ancestors -- more stronger
than i -- the tokenism and invisibility of our invincable accomplishements
in this city and what jay-z once reminded us, to get people to "see what
a nigga
look like when a nigga in a roadsta"/or nigga as an author -- to see
ourselves --
from niggas to gods as bruh akil once wrote. to hear ourselves -- not
the reflection
tolerance of the so called liberal british columbian society, a society
that has an
agenda of making this a white dialogue -- be it left or right -- junkie

since i have been here whatever opportunity, on an increasing level, has
been taken to degrade me -- to criminalize me, to take me down a few
notches -- tokenize and label. i have not been in the least bit
respected or publicly acknowledge as an asset to my community - to my
city. i have served this country for 11 years of my life. i have studied
the classics. i wrote what has been acknowledge as cult classic in the
united states. both novels have had featured reviews and praises from
the alterntive to mainstream presses, outside of victoria. i was the
first kkkanadian to have been signed to much saught after press. my
writngs have been included in the national poetry archieves, studied at
grad level in university. i have worked with food not bombs, put
together a zine of black, native and muslim knowledge and revolutionary
thought (mw), made chapbooks illustrated by local artists. my
recordings and writing have been heard and published, respectively,
internationally. my hope and struggle has always been for new
palestine. i have struggled for my community and faught and turned down
opportunities in both the u.s. and kkkanada who have attempted to
disrespect the peoples here and my fam and peoples in general --
compromise our integrity = "i am we". and have always acknowledged
being from victoria and not the more glamourous big city of vancouver,
like so many other artist have attempted to do, and all these efforts
have garndered is benign neglect, brutality and/or constant humilation
(to every step in my elevation which, will, god willing, remain
constant), and in the case of certain city privately contracted
individuals, like an animal who won't down stay. ...and by some
coincidence i'm am suppose to ignor, or we are, that all this has
happened to, and is happening to, the first black author of british
columbia. one not treated as a prize. ...not as human b.u.t. as being
killed by willful destruction. i must admit, i have been foolish, in my
obession over making this city and my hood feel and think and CEE.
...for i have, openly, in a covert manner, said, not worship or adore --
not even more importantly, like, maybe -- b.u.t. will you 'love me'.

...and all smirked all the way.

b.u.t i know that...

b.u.t. i grow tired...

...and my backpack, visible or not, gets heavier

kkkanadian towns have always had a history of, not only institutional,
b.u.t. local citizenry collective racism, harassment and complicity in
the rapes, murders and other wilful destruction of humnanbeings
undesired/'not wanted on the journey' by the static quo -- be they
natives, poor, black and now muslims and arabs - one might say that
kkkanada comes into it's own or collapses, for maybe it is what
ahmadinejad has said, 'colonialism time has come to an end', as
the nwo makes a power move on the world -- for
no two have anything more in common for the sadistic bullying, cold
kills, bought journalist monopolies on truth, worship of mediocrity, and
utter disregard for the individual and human values of difference and
varying cultures and voices.

in a town with aryan nation groups, fascists separatists electoral
parties, paranoid white folk training grounds, a gay community loyal to
corporate and white power causes, mercenaries and supremacist gangs
...they say the trouble and threat to freedome and what must be faught
and degraded for the safety of jews and even homosexuals, lies in
combating one of the victims of these totalitarianism groups since his
arrival -- the black author lawrence ytzhak braithwaite. ...and as good
hypocracy, the sort this country breeds in the very genes of it's
system, it is done with the stance of fighting against the oppression of
now oppressive groups = *homophobia* and now *antijewish* sentiments and
the new heretical religion of *holocaust deniel* i.e. hiding behind
white european jewish struggle (where if any negative comments were made
against these two groups, and new born religion, would have been deleted
within minutes) all of whom who having forgotten the solidarity that got
them here - or what it is like to be treated cruely by what was once the
opressors, have decided to join the daemon's cacophony of destruction
of enlightment for the dark ages of fear and ignorance, as bedfellows.

nigger go home.

...and bruthas got the shout down of *let the niggers burn*

imc's were created and fought for in an attempt to bring truth to the
people
and combat the lies of the mainstream coopted media. it then became an
outlet for creativity for those on the outskirts or rejecting mainstream
corporate arts -- BEE it hip hop, punk, rap, turntablism, literature,
poetry or creative non-fiction or film and video. it was not, however,
ever meant to be a forum for failed peoples to place themselves as admin
or editors and engage and provoke harassment and humiliation of
individuals who do not stroll with the party line -- nor was it meant
to be a lackey to brutal, apartheid regimes, totalitarian governments,
dysfunctional racist individuals and corporate whores. in the case of
victoria.indymedia.org, it has fallen victim to to the spooks of planted
seeds of kkkanadian imperialism and media same think unthink tank
totalitARYANism and showboaters.

my body and life in this place is the witness, inshallah.

Dear Friends,
Hi !
Every summer I spend 1-2 weeks at a place called Putnam Camp located in St.
Huberts New York in the heart of the Adirondaks High Peaks Region. The camp
has  been in continual operation since 1877, a historic, rustic, family resort.
The season runs from June 25th to Sept 2nd, and there are a number of
positions to be filled including Choreperson, Maintenance Assistant, Breakfast
Cook, Laundry Person, Cook, Kitchen Manager and General Manager.
I am sharing this with the poetics list because in the past the camp was  run
by a lovely academic couple, and most of the staff is college age, just
starting or about to go.
If you would like to learn more about a summer job that offers the great
outdoors and space and time to write and recreate, please feel free to contact
me at _nathanielsiegel@aol.com_ (mailto:nathanielsiegel@aol.com) .

Thank you !

Nathaniel

Hi mIEKAL,
I don't know if it's been mentioned
but Don Byrd's Charles Olson Maximus
published by University of Illinois Press
is an interesting and scholarly addition
to the Charlie O critical editions.
I too would like to see a few more
intense endeavors into Olson and his poetic legacy.

damn nice to see an (e-lit or whathaveyou) discussion here,

  the various names and labels and wee-wonkers that people stick to the various incarnations of cyber(insert other)-poetry are a sign that the art/writing form has matured enough for classification torubles to arise.

  personally, I dont much care for classifications and find these digital creatures (what I call them) to typically be created without an umbrella (or sunbrella for B.M.), without the notion of "my works fit here....and not here, make me some brownies you damn computer"

  I know my work seems to be drifting more into the art world, or new media (another troublesome sticky and chest high name tag) art spaces. I imagine that is more about their resources (prizes, gallery spaces, online playgrounds etc) than any sneaking slink towards any particular camp.

  Sadly, many of venues for (cyber)poetry seem to rise and fall with the few folks that run them. As you print editors know, it is damn hard to continue the good fight without an entourage of grad/undergrad ass editors or damn good friends to help.

  I personally, and no surprise here, seeing as though his office is a few feet from mine, agree with Mr. Zervos.   Text is animation, interface, sound, stabbing motions, a nice grilled apricot, the smooth of the back, and so certainly some (cyber)poems often have no word-words at all.

  cheers, Jason Nelson

There's a terrific conference happnin at the mo in my home town on digital
audio art, and i've have had the pleasure of Peter Courtemanche's company
for much of it. We talked today a bit about terminology. He mentioned that
many people feel that by the time the moniker 'performance art' had settled
on a certain range of work, it was basically over.

So perhaps it's a good sign that the dust has not settled enough for there
to be any agreement on these matters.

The problem with generic terms is that they're, well, generic.
 "Electronic writing" is fuzzy; could my poem written on an
old Selectric typewriter be called "electronic"?  "Computer
poetry" does little to distinguish b/t poets that use the
computer as a medium--poets that use the computer as an aid in
procedural or combinatorial poetry, for example--and then
poets that use the computer as a collaborator in the creation
of original poetry.

The helpful term "litware" (litteraciels) is used by the
researchers of computer-assisted literature connected to
Oulipo, which specifically names those computer-assisted
literatures that fulfill an "implicational level aimed at
using generative components such as the principles of
narrative logic to make possible the creation of complete,
complex works." (vide "ALAMO" in the _Oulipo Compendium_)

Software engineer Jon Trowbridge, who wrote the code for
Gnoetry0.0. 0.1 and 0.2

http://www.beardofbees.com/gnoetry.html

has taken to calling what the software does as "computational
poetry" and any discussion of how it works and of its results
as "computational poetics."  This seems a good, accurate
description of this brand of computer-assisted poetry, and
perhaps reminds us of the fact that a computer is a machine
used for calculation.

Call for Submissions
Dossier: Political Poetry

Each issue of COURT GREEN features a dossier on a special topic or
theme. Occasional or topical poetry is a fraught genre, but we live in
fraught times, and understand that poetry can be a way to negotiate
our relationship to the current political situation. For issue 4, we
are accepting submissions of poems that seek to expand the definition
or commonly held notions of "political poetry." All styles and
subjects welcome, but special consideration will be given to poems
that aim to explore and complicate rather than teach or hold forth.

Submissions of political poetry for consideration in the Dossier can
be sent through May 1, 2006 to: Editors, Court Green, English
Department, Columbia College Chicago, 600 South Michigan Avenue,
Chicago, IL 60605. Email submissions are not accepted.

Submissions of poetry for the regular section of the magazine are
welcome, in addition to Dossier submissions. If you would like to
submit poems for the regular section, our reading period is February
1-May 1 of each year, to the same address above.

Email me if you have questions (tony@starve.org). Thanks--

Best,

The original form of my essay, which my post was intended to point to, is
full of links to works:

http://www.arras.net/brown_ewriting/?p=10

I can't really engage in this discussion of the phrase "electronic writing"
-- it's what the class was called before I got here. A vague, innacurate
term is useful anyway, it leaves anyone free to do what they want with it.

After all, "projectivist" poetry was not an accurate moniker, nor did
"objectivist" poetry have anything to do with Ayn Rand or objectivist
philosophy.

I'm not sure that Young-Hae Chang considers her work "electronic writing"
but it is better written than most other "electronic writing" and it is in
Flash, a primo technology for electronic writing. But it's not
interactive... so, huh?  I dunno... but I do whatever I want in my work.

Jim, the second paragraph of my essay addresses print works that reflect
digital practices in their creation, which I think is what you were
addressing. As for audio, I think opening up pure audio works to being
called "electronic writing" leaves open the possibility of saying that
videos work is "electronic writing" because it has a screenplay, which I
actually think is true, but I don't want my students doing pure audio or
video works just yet.

POETRY READING AT COLUMBIA

MICHAEL HELLER

&

SAMUEL MENASHE

WHEN:      Tuesday, Feb. 7th, at 8 pm
WHERE:     the Deutsches Haus at Columbia
            420 W 116th St.  between Amsterdam and Morningside

  Michael Heller is the author of seven volumes of poetry, the most recent
being Exigent Futures: New and Selected Poems (Salt Publishing, 2003)  His
latest book is Uncertain Poetries: Selected Essays on Poets, Poetry and
Poetics (Salt Publishing, 2005).  The late Robert Creeley wrote of his
work: "There is a classic largeness to these poems, whether of means or of
reference--a consummately civilized response to our times that makes the
intimate and the physical still primary despite the generalized chaos
Heller movingly confronts."

Samuel Menashe has been honored with the first Neglected Masters Award from
the Poetry Foundation.  His most recent book is New and Selected Poems
(LIbrary of American, 2005).  Victor Howes, in The Christian Science
Monitor, remarked that "the art of Samuel Menashe is a jeweler's art, his
poems are small, precision-cut, gem-like, and give off little sparks and
splinters of flame."  Dana Gioia writes: "Menashe is essentially a
religious poet, though one without an orthodox creed.  Nearly every poem he
has ever published radiates a heightened religious awareness."



Exigent Futures: New and Selected Poems (2003) and Uncertain Poetries:
Selected Essays  (2005)
available from Salt Publishing at www.saltpublishing.com and at both
regular and online bookstores.

To whomever is interested,
I am currently distributing my free and 2nd self published chapbook. It is
an expression of agape, a love of the divine, and I am curious to see if any
list members would be interested in it. I do not claim to be anything in
particular and would simply love to share this short collection with any
interested parties. If you would like a copy, please email me at
ianvanh@hotmail.com and provide your address. The following is an excerpt
from the book:

there is a book
		in the thought
colored with dreams
there are the words
	etched with the trembling
voice of the heart

& there is love
a communion with the soul
	in the womb of the world
		we enter
		as joy
& are baptized in tears

of prayer, your child was born to live
let the bond that joins
be an iron castle
	fortified with patience

may the tree of your relationship
have deep roots
and may its canopy
build a tent
	with your shared affection

why does this poet rejoice
	because in your arms
is a union with God!

Peace be with you and thank you for your time,
Ian VanHeusen

Some other things that I've put online recently might be of interest to you.


The first actually went live several weeks ago. It's a discussion of the
role of text in electronic writing, developed from a response to a chapter
of the book First Person. Catch the link at my blog:



http://www.arras.net/fscIII/



You can now leave comments at the blog, but also at Electronic Book Review,
where the essay is stored.



Second is a few more paragraphs I wrote in preparation for my class, called
Themes and Contexts. It's really just a very short glossary of concepts I
like to toss around. I left more easily graspable concepts out of it:



http://www.arras.net/brown_ewriting/?page_id=20



Lastly, here's a short piece that one of my students did last semester that
I think is pretty cool.

Eric--

  I have been considering your questions about chapbook reviews, how
difficult they are in e-chap format, let alone otherwise & since our
chapbooks are reviewed regularly I am wondering what your adversity is to
creating a small run of the physical chapbook? I publish 400, which
involves a physical cost you might not wont the burden of, but what about 30
for review & not mentioning the run--

  As a trend, small runs are what most full-length book publishers are doing,
beyond the corporate houses there are less than 2 dozen of us who are
still publishing 1000 or more run editions. Applying this ideology to
chaps seems even more feasible as there is not a quality issue / problem.




Be well

Steve,
A brilliant piece of detective work here and well written!=20

Not sure I buy into the idea that the gift to Poetry was tied to a =
"cover-up" of any kind, e.g. the decline in value of the Lilly stock, or =
what ever else, but I share your view that the Lilly folks, at least the =
CHQ ones are Bush's folks.  The Poetry benefactor however, hmmmm...I =
viewed her bequests more as a self-serving desire to be associated with =
something she was not, a poet and an artist. =20

On the other hand, you are most accurate in your analysis that the =
timing certainly helped take the heat off several other fronts for both =
Lilly and the entire pharmaceutical de-regulation stuff!  Was that a =
planned (diabolical) plot on the part of the deceased?  Don't think so!  =
Did she have help from the CHQ folks in forming that thought?  Sounds =
too much like an Oliver Stone movie to me...too much speculation, too =
few facts to substantiate the thought.=20

None the less, I'm looking forward to the rest of the material.
Alex=20

Several people have mentioned to me that they enjoyed my "Proust-Juice" entries on Stoning the Devil. I've decided to devote Stoning the Devil to lit-crit, so that gives me a good excuse to found a third & final blog: "Fieled's Proust-Juice". It's at www.proustjuice.blogspot.com. Meanwhile, lots of new lit-crit at Stoning the Devil (www.adamfieled.blogspot.com) and new poetry at PFS Post (www.artrecess.blogspot.com).
      Thanks, y'all...

What I find interesting is that no one is challenging the "poetry"
Foundation to justify the cash they waste and why the poetry community does
not organize to challenge what they are doing?

Just think about this statistic for the same amount that they just spent to
research why Americans do not read poetry they could have endowed 10 small
presses for five years.

With all the money they have they could have supported reading series in
rural and suburban America where poetry does not exist.

They could have provided hundreds of scholarships for the education of
poets.

They could have created a place where poetry could have its own institution
like the National Science Foundation
Giving out grants to poets to do important work.

The problem is that the PF is a sea of mediocrities, Billy Collins lovers--
give me a break Kay Ryan is a great poet?
What a crock

Here's a fascinating article about how poetry and other art forms can help
young people express themselves and deal with disasters --

Arts Education Promotes Healing for Hurricanes' Kids

In Waveland, Mississippi, 75 kites recently flew defiantly against winds
that once battered the town. Lumber collected from demolished homes became
kite frames, and high school students' poetry scrawled on colored paper
became kite tails. This project and other creative arts have enabled
students affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to express their emotions,
and go back to school with a sense of release and a return to normalcy. One
student, Caitlin Dalgo, noted, "All of us put our thoughts into our kites as
we made them, and when we let our kites go in the wind, the wind blew all
the bad times and memories away."

The Mississippi Whole Schools Initiative, a comprehensive school reform
group, the Mississippi Arts Commission, and DreamYard, a New York-based arts
education nonprofit organization, sponsored the kite project in Waveland for
students from Ocean Springs, Bay St. Louis, and Laurel, each designated a
disaster area after Hurricane Katrina. In addition to creating kites, with
guidance from DreamYard teachers, students wrote original monologues, short
scenes, and poetry, which were integrated into a collaborative arts project
among the schools. The project and an anthology of students' poetry were
recently unveiled to community members and students at a ceremony at Bay St.
Louis High School.

The Waveland kites and other arts education initiatives have emerged as a
way for students to heal after the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and
Rita. The U.S. Department of Education has produced a resource for parents,
educators, coaches, and children called Tips for Helping Students Recovering
from Traumatic Events. In the "Tips for Students" section, the booklet
acknowledges that, after a disaster, students may want to find ways to
express themselves by creating artwork, writing, playing music, or singing.
This approach is supported by the National Institute of Mental Health and
the American Psychological Association, as well.

An added benefit is that students may reap academic benefits while
expressing themselves through the arts. At the "Coming Up Taller" Awards in
2004, for example, First Lady Laura Bush noted, "The arts...are critical
building blocks for a child's development and they provide a foundation for
a lifetime of learning. Drawing helps children improve their writing skills.
The study of poetry helps with memory and vocabulary. Theater can bring
history to life."

In the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, for example, schools and
organizations recognized the potential of arts activities to help students
deal with trauma. The New York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund established the
School Arts Rescue Initiative where staff and artists, many from the New
York City nonprofit ArtsConnection, created music, dance, theater, and
visual arts programs to help students work through their emotions and learn
about tolerance. In West Sacramento, California, second graders at Bryte
Elementary School used their language arts unit on bravery to create a book
called Some People Are Brave. The book with writings and illustrations of
the disaster was published locally by Kinko's and then published nationally
by SRA/McGraw-Hill. Dawn Imamoto, the teacher who organized the project and
a participant in the OII-funded National Writing Project, recalls, "What my
students could not express orally, they were able to do in writing and
illustrating."

In line with Tips for Helping Students Recovering from Trauma, the Alliance
for Young Artists and Writers is providing students with a creative outlet
through its administration of The Scholastic Art & Writing Awards. In
addition to the national awards that annually recognize outstanding works of
art and writing created by students in seventh through twelfth grade, in May
2006, the Alliance plans to launch a virtual gallery and program entitled
"Kids Reconstruct with Creativity." The student artwork will document how
youth are coping with the loss and dislocation caused by the 2005 hurricanes
in the Gulf Coast and Florida.

At the local level, Fairhope, Alabama, which was hard-hit by Hurricane
Katrina, has ratcheted up resources to absorb victims from other communities
that were more severely damaged. At Fairhope's Eastern Shore Art Center,
both local and evacuee youth have been welcomed into its studios and
galleries. Nancy Raia, the Center's Arts Bridging Creativity (ABC) Project
Director, and Vicky Nix Cook, a former classroom teacher and current
supervisor for fine arts at the Baldwin County (AL) Public Schools,
organized a "Hurricane Hair" project for students at Fairhope Middle School.
The project originated as a response to Hurricane Ivan that ravaged Fairhope
in 2004, and was so successful that Ms. Raia and Ms. Cook brought it back
for victims of Katrina and Rita. Students designed whimsical postcards for
the project. Each picture depicts a person experiencing a "bad hair day."
Students used straws to blow paints onto the surface of postcards, making it
appear that the resulting brightly colored hair is blowing in the wind. Last
year, proceeds from the Hurricane Hair postcards went to Ivan charities and
tsunami aid. This year, in addition to helping students heal, these
postcards were turned into a fundraiser for the American Red Cross.

Following a monochromatic theme, the Center also organized a Blue Faces of
Katrina project for local students and evacuees from various Mississippi and
Louisiana schools. Students discussed their experiences and painted faces
using blue pigment. They learned about Pablo Picasso's "Blue Period" and how
the artist used his art to depict human misery and alleviate his own
depression. Henry Kutzenski, a seventh grade Louisiana student displaced by
the storm noted, "[This project] helped me express a bit more of what I
feel...sadness but also hope."

Like Henry, as many as 200,000 displaced students have found safe haven in
new schools and cities across the country. In Texas, the Theatre Action
Project (TAP), an educational interactive theater company serving over 50
schools in greater Austin, organized creative arts classes for thousands of
evacuees in the Austin Convention Center. A TAP program specialist developed
the curriculum for pre-kindergarten students. TAP also arranged classes,
which consisted of theater games and writing and drawing exercises, for
older children at the Convention Center in the evenings. In addition,
classes are led by TAP teachers at Heart House, a local after-school
program. They represent a collaborative effort between TAP and another
Austin arts organization, Outreach Productions. Also in Texas, Big Thought,
a learning partnership that supports community partnerships, cultural
integration, youth development, and family learning, is offering arts
programming to students through 56 cultural partners involved in the Dallas
ArtsPartners program.

In addition to providing services to students, schools and arts
organizations have coordinated fundraising efforts. For example, Virginia
Commonwealth University is spearheading an exhibition of artists' work from
around the world based on the theme of "The Power of Water." Proceeds from
the sale of the artwork go to the National Art Education Association (NAEA)
Hurricane Katrina Recovery Fund, where the aim is to rebuild schools in
areas hardest hit by the storm. The U.S. Department of Education website
"Hurricane Help for Schools" also continues to link donors who wish to help
hurricane-affected schools and those that have taken in students displaced
by Katrina and Rita. As of early January, 551 connections had been made
through the website.

On a musical note, the VH1 Save the Music Foundation is focused on donating
instruments to students in affected areas, and reaching out to its Arts
Coordinators in the Gulf Coast. MENC: The National Association for Music
Education (formerly Music Educators National Conference) has funneled
donations through a fund set up by NAMM: International Music Products
Association to assist with the efforts of charities such as the Mr.
Holland's Opus Foundation, MusiCares, and the American Red Cross.

Across the country, the arts are connecting resources, students, and
communities to each other in an effort to heal and rebuild. KID smART, a
local New Orleans nonprofit that teaches life skills to underprivileged
children through visual and performing arts, is crossing its borders and
organizing arts programming at KIPP-NOW (Knowledge Is Power Program - New
Orleans West) College Prep in Houston, Texas, a K-8 school recently created
for students displaced by the hurricane.

On December 10, a group of artists, educators, and community members,
coordinated through KID smART, convened at the Crescent City Farmers' Market
in New Orleans. They carried shells from Lake Pontchatrain, branches from
fallen trees, and pine needles from the North Shore. The group collected
these materials to create a giant mandala, a Hindu and Buddhist circular
design containing symbols of wisdom. The mandala was used to redirect the
city's painful symbols of destruction into a representation of change and
hope.

The Office of Innovation and Improvement funds Arts in Education grant
programs and the Arts Education Partnership (AEP). The Mississippi Whole
Schools Initiative, ArtsConnection, and Big Thought have received Arts in
Education Model Development and Dissemination grants. The Alliance for Young
Artists and Writers, the National Art Education Association (NAEA), the
Mississippi Arts Commission, NAMM: International Music Products Association,
MENC: The National Association for Music Education, the National Network for
Folk Arts in Education (see What's New), the Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation,
and the VH-1 Save the Music Foundation are all members of AEP.

Note: There is little research available on the benefit of art therapy in
helping survivors of traumatic experiences; however, a randomized,
controlled trial of "mindfulness-based art therapy" (MBAT) was funded by a
grant from the National Institutes of Health/National Center for
Complementary and Alternative Medicine. This study of women with cancer
found that, as compared to the control group," the MBAT group demonstrated a
significant decrease in symptoms of distress... and significant improvements
in key aspects of health-related quality of life..."

A few Things to Ponder About Slick Rick the Ruler


Rick cautioned folks not to get caught up in the racial thing because he
expressed love for the Beatles and Elvis. He stressed that they were
good at their craft and they cannot be denied. He said that far too
often we over generalize people and that everyone Black and white have
good things to offer. Rick also spoke fondly of the Rat pack which
featured Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis and Dean Martin. He said that one
should not sleep on Dean and that his showmanship was and style was dope.

A few Things to Ponder About Slick Rick the Ruler

by Davey D

Slick Rick is considered by many to be one of Hip Hop’s most colorful
characters and the genre’s greatest storyteller. He’s also considered
one of Hip Hop’s better performers. One thing is for certain, he lived
up to those glowing adjectives this past weekend when he rolled through
the Bay Area to do a special show.

Unlike most so called old school acts, Slick Rick did not need to show
up and be apart of an ‘old school rap package that featured 10 other
groups. He and he alone packed out the Mezzanine Night club in San
Francisco with both a capacity crowd as well as a who’s who in local Bay
Area celebrities. The make up of the crowd covered damn near all the
generations within Hip Hop. You saw over the over 30 and 40 crowd
rolling deep in one corner. You saw the twenty-somethings in another
corner. You saw some sporting fancy fur coats and big ole dookey chains
from ‘back in the days’, while others were rocking the latest Sean jean
and Roc-A-Wear. The dance floor was packed with people who gathered
around b-boy and b-girl circles to watch folks pop, strut and spin on
their backs. In another part of the club you saw folks doing the latest
Hyphy dances.

But no matter whop they were and what they were doing, they all of them
came to see Slick Rick the Ruler who did not disappoint. I had spoken
with Rick the day before his show and he emphatically talked about two
things that he seemed determined to address with his performance. First,
he seemed annoyed that the record industry gatekeepers continue to erase
and put to the back anybody who is older. Rick who is now 40 talked
about how the industry has created a climate where folks feel
comfortable in disrespecting Hip Hop’s history and its icons. He said
this sort of attitude has resulted in a lot of older cats walking around
pretending they are real young just to fit into the industry.

Rick also pointed out the while its important to create space and allow
the newer generation to have their time in the sun, it’s been
disconcerting to see that so many have not built upon past lessons and
approaches to Hip Hop. He was specifically referring to showmanship. He
spoke about how there has always been a premium on artists being able to
do good shows. He says it was and continues to be critical. One was
expected to put forth an effort to adorn a costume or style of dress,
have a well crafted image and be able to rock the crowd. He cited Big
daddy Kane’s recent performance on VH1 Hip Hop Honors as an example of
what Hip Hop should be striving for. However, with many of today’s
artists that skill set has been lost… Rick would like to see that change.

When Slick Rick hit the stage this past Saturday night he showed
everyone including veteran performers how it should be done. He broke
out wearing his traditional fly outfit and adorned with mounds of trunk
jewelry. The crowd went nuts when he hit the stage. They went even more
nuts when he started rocking all his hit songs to the house band which
was headed up by long time neo-soul-jazz artists Ricky Rick and Vernon
Hall. As an added surprise Dwayne Wiggins of the group Tony Toni Tone
jumped on stage with Rick to back him up and the rest they say his
history. The place went crazy…

Slick Rick hammered home his point about not sleeping on the old school
when he asked his deejay DJ Kaos to spin a few records from the old
school and match them up against today’s hits. Rick wanted the crowd to
compare. Yes, the crowd went nuts to hit songs from artists like Young
Jeezy and Mannie Fresh. But once you heard classic cuts from Eric B and
Rakim or Big Daddy Kane, there was simply no comparison. The old school
won out that night.

As for our interview with Slick Rick, he remained as colorful as ever.
As I mentioned he spoke about the importance of doing good shows and ran
off a short list of entertainers that all newcomers should peep and
learn from. Among those cited were the Beatles and Elvis Presley, Gladys
Knight and James Brown.

Rick cautioned folks not to get caught up in the racial thing because he
expressed love for the Beatles and Elvis. He stressed that they were
good at their craft and they cannot be denied. He said that far too
often we over generalize people and that everyone Black and white have
good things to offer. Rick also spoke fondly of the Rat pack which
featured Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis and Dean Martin. He said that one
should not sleep on Dean and that his showmanship was and style was dope.

During our interview we spoke with Rick about the legacy of his former
crew the Kangol Crew which some may consider Hip Hop’s first ‘Rap Pack’.
He talked about the good fortune that fell upon members like himself and
Dana Dane.

Slick Rick also spoke on the art of storytelling and how he goes about
writing his rhymes. Anybody who is an emcee will wanna peep out some of
Slick Rick’s techniques. For example, he says the best way to write a
rap that tells a story is to write the second, third or forth line first…

We ended our interview by speaking on politics. Rick offered up his
insight about the Democrats and explained why he attended 2004 National
Hip Hop Political Convention and told people not to vote for George Bush
or John Kerry. He also broke down the things we need to be aware of
regarding the nomination of Judge Alioto for the Supreme Court. He
concluded by giving some choice words about England’s Prime Minister
Tony Blair.

This is very sad news. Paik Nam June was an amazing artist. I love those
collaborations he did with Joseph Beuys. There's that story about when he
snipped John Cage's tie in half during a Fluxus performance...

Here're some audio clips of Paik performing with cellist Charlotte Moorman
and saxophonist Terry Jennings: http://www.ubu.com/sound/moorman.html.

Here's a link to the PNJ retrospective that was at the Guggenheim several
years ago:

Ray :

..|  community does not organize to challenge what they are doing?

I guess to answer to this question you need to ask how much you believe
"poetry" and "cash" are related. I suppose a lot of people have made
"cash" into "poetry". The line does grow thick. It's tough to see a day
go by onlist without some commerce established.

But why trouble the Poetry Foundation? You will always have need of more
scholarships, reading series, and places in America where poetry would
be a much needed gift.

Why don't you challenge what you are doing?  Whenever you choose, you
can provide all things and more. (If you will try, you will find that
you can.)

Life is an experiment to a great extent untried...

Can there be a call to petition this outrage? If everyone one the list sign=
ed - electronically - a petition and sent it to the editors of Poetry, we m=
ight be able to gauge what kind of reaction these 'poets' may elicit. Even =
if it's an experiment in futility, at least we'll know what is actually bei=
ng heard and what, as is usually the case, is being swept under the carpet.

Viva Hate.

Yeah, and we gotta do it smart, and with a sense of fun.

When the Beats helped "open up" poetry in the 50s and turned new people onto
it, the stuffy snobs of the day (somewhat analogous to the Lilly/Poetry
folks of today) showed their true colors in reaction. Today, the dynamics
might be a little different. So the cautionary tale I get from this for
today, assuming we could get some major media attention, would be to try
to be aware of how they might be able to present US rather than THEM
as the Poetry Cops, and paint us into a corner, or have us paint ourselves
into a corner. I think brainstorming on some ways to avoid this risk
would be important. The story about how the LILLY people approached THE
POETRY PROJECT to try to get some of THEIR money, I think, is very telling,
and could be strategically used to show what they are on about.....

More later---I gotta run...

Solidarnos,
Chris

Ok, would some one please take a moment and explain...in simple terms, =
remembering my lack of intellect...to me what there is to object to with =
the the Poetry Foundation's inheritance? =20

My view: some rich lady died; she could have left her estate to pigeons =
in Central Park or to her great-great third cousin in Peoria.  Instead, =
she chose to split her wealth up among a few organizations she felt =
deserving of assistance. =20

Why did she do this?  Who the hell knows...she was in love with one of =
the lady poets she once heard read during her undergrad days?  Or maybe, =
she really liked the kind of poetry the Magazine used to publish, and it =
was her way of attempting to finance that activity into perpetuity. =20

It was her money; she did with it as she chose. =20

Now, as for the newly named Poetry Foundation.  What will they do with =
that new found wealth?  One thing is for certain: they never would =
publish anything I wrote before they became wealthy; it's a pretty good =
bet they'll hold that position into the future, so it's safe to say they =
remain unchanged by their endowment.  How commendable is that?  Money =
will not change nor spoil them.

Any way, I'm a little confused by some (if not all except my very own) =
responses to Steve Evans' well done efforts.  What exactly is the =
"outrage" ?=20

  Can there be a call to petition this outrage? If everyone one the list =
signed - electronically - a petition and sent it to the editors of =
Poetry, we might be able to gauge what kind of reaction these 'poets' =
may elicit. Even if it's an experiment in futility, at least we'll know =
what is actually being heard and what, as is usually the case, is being =
swept under the carpet.

Greil Marcus conjured a vision of the =B3Old, Weird America=B2 in his book of
the same title, of a landscape where blues and folk musicians of different
eras interacted in a beautiful and violent place accessible by something
like a turn of phrase from a Bob Dylan song. This will be a talk/performanc=

I have long been interested in institutional history, not particularly
because no one else is, but because I believe being aware of the =
structure
or situation of a given organization in its founding and through time =
leads
to some sort of understanding of the way it functions.

so to with poetry, and while my knowledge of poetry, editorial policy, =
money
problems, organization, mission, and history, etc. is culled from =
various
books and not from a few weeks reading archival material, because I am =
so
interested in overlooked female writers publishing books prior to 1923, =
the
poetry circle around Harriet Monroe is something that I suppose I would =
like
to be important to me --

it is no secret that the fairly wealthy and cosmopolitan women poets of =
the
Midwest who formed Monroe's mainstay, her subscribers, supporters, and =
many
of the poets she published -- those she published much to the chagrin of
Pound and then I suppose Eliot insofar as he commented -- those who read =
her
work, instead of using her as a publisher only, were women perhaps =
unlike
Lilly and more like Monroe in that they had somewhat less money and =
wrote
more and better, but still.  In other words, Mary Aldis, for example, =
who
published a single (and excellent) book as far as I know was the wife of =
a
real estate developer in Chicago who gave a fair bit of money to the
journal.  Alice Corbin Henderson, a long-forgotten poet, was the =
assistant
editor, and in particular a target of Pound's ire.  I could go on and
develop these examples more, but --

look, Pound didn't found the magazine; he harangued Monroe, and may have
solicited some of the best work poetry published, but he didn't succeed =
in
taking the magazine and its policies over, and he needed the monetary =
and
"publicity" support that poetry had to offer to give to his friends, =
et.al.;
and Monroe was always a more conservative acquisitions editor and =
publisher,
and had her eye far more on the bottom line, than the editors of many a
now-defunct journal

even during the later period of the objectivist number, etc., there was =
an
annual prize, not unlike the annual prize many journals have now, judged =
by
the editors, and it is no secret that a lot of now-forgotten poets who =
were
writing ghosts of sonnets won this prize, and not the experimental poets =
of
the time

So in fact, on can argue that the Lilly gambit, the long Parisi tenure, =
etc.
is in line with the history of the journal, and it is only in their =
failure
to be as savvy editors and publishers, to listen, as Monroe did that has =
led
them to publish and support "a type of poetry" -- to exclude many =
poetries
written in English that Monroe -- and her contentious sub-editors -- =
were
open to, eager to find and support... but what was Apple without Jobs? =20

and as far as "tainted money" --=20

Stew Albert died today, January 30, 2003 at 3:20 a.m, age 66. Peacefully, in
his sleep, surrounded by Judy, Jessica and his many friends. Funeral
services this Wednesday, Feb. 1 at Havurah Shalom in Portland.

Stew at the last ...

Hospice is coming in regularly -- as the symptoms of end stage liver cancer
are well in place. Spoke with Judy yesterday -- their daughter Jessica is in
from SF and of course Stew is as comfortable as possible. When I was with
him the other day it seemed to me that he is ready when everything else is
ready..

Prayers to our brother Stew Albert-- a Yippie of the first degree - a man of
our times who stood up for 'us' - one and all -- and did the time for 'us'
whenever he was arrested with the likes of the Berrigan Brothers -- a man
who in many ways brought 'us' all -- one and all - a bit closer in
understanding and support for Huey Newton and the Panthers, helping to
levitate the Pentagon and so so much more as he continues to believe in 'us'
-- one and all.

I am so thankful -- nay, blessed, to have known this gentle man -
a loving and devoted husband-father, activist and friend.

"However, if one's conscience is to be truly clear, it is the actions of
Avner's parents' generation which need to be acknowledged and
reconciled. After his mission, Avner asks his mother, who lost many
family members during the Holocaust, if she wants to know what he did on
his mission and she declines. "Whatever it took, whatever it takes, we
have a place on earth at last," she tells him. But whether a people —
citizens of Israel like Avner or supporters of the state like Spielberg
— can feel morally whole with such fresh wounds is the question that
truly needs to be dealt with." -- "'Munich': Spielberg's thrilling

Hi all --

rhubarb is susan is back online! Welcome to the new era of rhubarb is
susan. Last night I sent the final draft of my thesis to my committee;
there's now a four week waiting period while they read it and make the
reader's report. So fingers crossed.

rhubarb is back online, and with one new review, of a poem by Henry Gould
appearing in his new book Dove Street:

http://rhubarbissusan.blogspot.com/2006/01/henry-gould-basilique-sainte-madeleine.html
http://rhubarbissusan.blogspot.com/

I have a whole sheaf of fantastic things to review, and will be getting to
them in the coming days. Stay tuned to rhubarb is susan; if you're a tech
guru RSS guru genius type, or you use something like google or yahoo's
newsfeeds, you can "subscribe" to rhubarb to be alerted when a new review
goes live:

http://feeds.feedburner.com/rhubarb

Finally: The first fundraiser pulled in $19.52 in comissions on $260.26 in
sales; as promised, I've doubled that and sent the total $39.04 to the
FCNL, the Friends Committee on National Legislation, a Quaker-founded
ecumenical group working for peace and justice in Washington DC. I was
able to see what books were purchased (though not the buyer names) and
while I won't reveal the titles for privacy reasons, I have to say you
girls and guys are seriously classy. I don't even recognize half of the
presses, let alone the authors. Thanks, then, to all who participated and
made me feel uneducated and provincial; what I'll do is keep the
fundraiser running, but without the matching contribution. Which means
that 7.5% of (pre-shipping) purchases you make by following links to
Powell's on the blog will continue to go towards the FCNL.

When I was very young I took a course in what I thought would be
contemporary po, since the course was named 'Modern Poetry'. So, yes, I
agree that art names function other than as 'chair' and 'stone'. When I
think of "Electronic Poetry", I think not so much of the meaning of either
of those words as of hypertext and the Electronic Literature Organization
and, mostly, USAmerican efforts. It does seem to be quite USAmerican in its
involvement, doesn't it, as opposed, say, to 'digital writing' or 'digital
literature'.

The electronic part of poetry that preceeds the digital is largely not
USAmerican, though there are perhaps even more than a few very wonderful
artists such as WS Burroughs and, more recently, Gregory Whitehead, Susan
Stone, Jenny Holzer, and undoubtedly many others who brilliantly used
recorded sound or video or other electronic media as serious literary media.

Recorded sound goes back quite a ways. I see ubu.com has a recording, for
instance, of Apollinaire from 1913 and Vladimir Maiakovski from 1914. I
don't really know if the early work is *accurately* described as
"electronic", but the difference between electronic recorded sound and
non-electronic recorded sound is surely incidental, is more a matter of the
technology than the art. I've heard recordings of sound poets from quite
early in the twentieth century, and I don't recall any by USAmericans.

But the gist of what I'm saying is this: the idea of beginning 'electronic
literature' with the digital seems to me to dismiss too much important
electronic work done prior to the digital. Does the term 'Electronic
Literature', then, as it is commonly used, display a certain myopic
insularity?

Somewhere in an Erin Mour=E9 poem (essay?) I remember reading a line to =20=

the effect that books left unread on bookshelves still have an effect =20=

on people, or on the books around them. For that matter, I think this =20=

is an idea that has been expressed by more than a few poets. Can =20
anyone tell me the Mour=E9 source, or give me other formulations of the =20=

same idea? I am trying to use the concept in an essay.

Thanks

Is the work of Burroughs, Holzer etc to digital writing/digital poetry as
horses are to cars? Please. That work is electronic literature, Brian, in
probably a more accurate sense than digital poetry is electronic literature.
The notion of defining 'Electronic Literature' in such a way that it begins
with the digital sweeps that work away as electronic literature, as it does
to the better part of a century of work.

The term 'Electronic Literature' is not going to have much historical value
for this and other reasons.

Mr Baratier

Since we like the idea of *freely* distributable poetry, we
are loath to print print runs.  Given the fracas over Poetry
monies and government fundings, we feel that if there's an
opportunity to create and to distribute poetry without ANY
overhead and without ANY cost to anybody, we'd like to take
advantage.

Since we started to publish the work of mere humans (and not
just machine/human collaborations) about two and a half years
ago, around 8000 chapbooks have been downloaded by folks.  The
fact, too, that we're sure many of these chaps were downloaded
and laser or ink-jet printed by people at work only delights
us more.

As to the idea of a small print run to send off for reviews;
maybe not a bad plan.  You're right about quality not being a
big issue.  We'd rather, though, that letters detailing our
list be enough for editors to type in an url and see what's up.

Thanks,

Eric Elshtain

Subject: Re: Beard of Bees Chap question

Eric--

 I have been considering your questions about chapbook
reviews, how
difficult they are in e-chap format, let alone otherwise &
since our
chapbooks are reviewed regularly I am wondering what your
adversity is to
creating a small run of the physical chapbook? I publish 400,
which
involves a physical cost you might not wont the burden of, but
what about 30
for review & not mentioning the run--

 As a trend, small runs are what most full-length book
publishers are doing,
beyond the corporate houses there are less than 2 dozen of us
who are
still publishing 1000 or more run editions. Applying this
ideology to
chaps seems even more feasible as there is not a quality issue
/ problem.




Be well

The serialization of "Free (Market) Verse" continues today with parts
2 and 3 ("Poets for Bush" and "Deregulating Poetry"). The
introduction will remain online until midnight tonight.

The article will wrap up on Wednesday with the final two sections
("Poetics of the Backlash" and "And Deliver Us from Modernism").

The whole thing will soon be available in print in The Baffler, by
whose kind permission I am running this web version.

Thanks to everyone who has taken an interest in the topic both here
on the list and on individual blogs. I hope to scratch out some
follow-up comments late in the week.

On another note: sad to say goodbye to Nam June Paik. His televisions
were a constant and consistently surprising fact of the UCSD campus
when I studied and lived there in the mid-80s and I've loved his work
ever since. The anecdote of him snipping Cage's necktie at a
performance (recounted on a video about Cage & Cunningham) for some
reason keeps coming to mind....

How rap music was blamed for the Paris riots


     Clichy-sous-Bois, the impoverished and segregated north-eastern
suburb of Paris where the two men lived and where the violent reaction
to their deaths began, was a ticking bomb for the kind of dramatic
social upheaval we are currently witnessing. ...A simple gesture of
regret could go a long way towards defusing the tensions for now. The
morning after the gassing of the mosque, a young Muslim woman summed up
a widespread feeling: "We just want them to stop lying, to admit they've
done it and to apologise." -- NAIMA BOUTELDJA -- "The Explosion in the
Suburbs: Paris is Burning"

"Samedi soir, au moment de la rupture du jeûne (vers 18h30), les 400 CRS
et gendarmes, dont une partie vient de Chalon s/saone, sont sortis un
peu partout dans la cité du Chêne pointu. Comme à l’accoutumée, il
s’agissait d’encercler - "de boucler" - le quartier. Don quichottisme
policier : en cohorte, à la façon des légions romaines, au pas de
course, visière baissée, bouclier au bras, et flashball à la main, ils
parcourent les rues une à une contre des ennemis invisibles....Pourquoi
cette démonstration de force alors même que les rues étaient
particulièrement calmes ?" -- Antoine Germa -- "Clichy-sous-Bois : zone
de non-droits ou zone d’injustices ?"

On 27th October 2005, teenagers Zyed Benna and Bouna Traore climbed into
an electrical sub-station in the Parisian banlieue of Clichy-sous-Bois,
and were electrocuted.

Their deaths sparked three weeks of riots that tore across France, and
ignited a debate that could have serious repercussions for freedom of
speech and for French rap music.

Weeks after the riots politician François Grosdidier filed a petition
signed by 200 French MPs to bring legal action against seven French rap
acts, for inflammatory lyrics and 'hatred of France'.

Annie Mac investigates the story of how rap took the blame for the
French riots…

SUNDAY FEB. 5th
@ Zebulon Concert/Cafe
(directions below)

IRA COHEN'S 71ST BIRTHDAY PARTY
come celebrate with Ira Cohen & friends
an evening of Poetry, Film, & Music

Special Feature:
PARADISE NOW: THE LIVING THEATRE IN AMERIKA (1968)*
A film by Marty Topp - Produced for Universal Mutant by Ira Cohen

"Ira Cohen and Marty Topp's film of 'Paradise Now' reveals how the
theories of revolutionary change and the experience of sexual
liberation are not separate paths to the beautiful nonviolent
anarchist revolution.  Together they form a single thrust encompassing
both political action and sensual joy, leading to the dreamed-of
terrestrial paradise." - Judith Malina

Hey,
When you say hard to find, do you mean not available on amazon, or just not usually stocked on bookstore shelves?

Thanks,

" But why trouble the Poetry Foundation? You will always have need of more
scholarships, reading series, and places in America where poetry would be a
much needed gift.

Why don't you challenge what you are doing?  Whenever you choose, you can
provide all things and more. (If you will try, you will find that you can.)"


Derek:

I am more than willing to put all the free work I do on behalf of poetry in
Chicago against what the Poetry Foundation does. I have a website that I pay
for out of my own pocket and devote allot of time to that has promoted
living, innovative poets and their books in Chicago, the midwest and the
nation, it also has a calendar for our region that is used by over 10,000
unique readers a month. I also have launched out on my own with Bill
Allegrezza a bookpress. I don't have millions but I believe in the artform
and care passionately about it so I do it.

What does the Poetry Foundation care about?

An example of Success----

Here in Chicago a decision was made in the 1970's by foundations to support
live theatre. Today Chicago arguably has a better theatre scene than New
York because people who care about theatre spent their money to build
infrastructure of the artform. We now have over 30 non profit theatre
companies and independent theatres like Steppenwolf, Looking Glass and
Goodman are world reknowned.

The Poetry Foundation could do the same with poetry in many US Cities
bringing the artform a new prominence; they have not done this . The problem
with the Poetry Foundation is that they have the resources to really help
OUR artform to have a larger profile and they have chosen to give themselves
a bigger profile. The Poetry Foundation has chosen to do the following with
their millions, pay for a survey that no one cares about, Launch poetry
prizes that 'poets' like Billy Collins and Kay Ryan have won, and to launch
a reading series here in Chicago that they CHARGE $12.00 a person to attend.


While they are doing these things reading series and presses in their own
backyard are self financing themselves and struggling. The problem with the
Poetry Foundation is that they are controlled by small minded people who are
not visionaries.  This is a problem that mainstream poetry suffers from in
the US and the Poetry Foundation is the essential example of this.

ABOUT THIS PRODUCT:
NOISY is a four letter word. The most unwanted byproduct of =20
population is noise. Noise is a weed to be plowed under, for hope of =20
a flower later, that a planet so wealthy with a resource that is =20
pungent with chaotic bits of info could rhetorically sacrifice it to =20
the distant surroundings, to the recent past. Noise is a food like =20
oxygen, or is a piece of information like the mail.
Noise has entered our waking conscience, forcefully & can not be =20
relinquished to the un/sub conscience. There lies within noise a =20
manner of empowerization that is both organic & suggestive. Noise =20
constitutes all that remains undigested, confused & in opposition.
Noise is the diamond of the future, mined & recycled for its luster, =20
for its clues to the nature & construction of infinity. Noise =20
reproduces in all directions with nucleic passion, with spidery =20
unpredictability.

RadioActive San Diego: State of the Apocalypse 2006 - Tonight!


    This Tuesday, January 31, the president will be giving his State of
the Union address, which should cause us all to vomit or explode with
horror. However, your loving pals at RadioActive San Diego will be
covering this infernal event *live*, cutting through the lies and giving
this simian the mocking of a lifetime. We will also take live calls from
activists in the streets protesting the President's speech...

As you may know, the President of the United States is a lying sack of crap.

infernal event *live*, cutting through the lies and giving this simian
the mocking of a lifetime. We will also take live calls from activists
in the streets protesting the President's speech at 619-269-4693, and we
may also cover the "rebuttal" by the "opposition party", the
"Democrats", exposing them as the collaborators they are.

Also, John Kerry is scrambling around the capitol in hopes of securing
last minute support for a filibuster against Judge Alito. Public
gatherings, blogs and email petitions continue, giving voice to
widespread opposition to the high court nominee. See events in
Tennessee, Philly, DC, Miami, and San Fran. There is still time to call
(Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) 202-224-3841) or fax key Senators before
4:30PM on Monday.

for those of you following the thread begun by Steve Evans' essay, and/or the various bloggage around the Legit Dangers anthology -
Please read Mark Nowak's Workers of the Word, from Palm Press - a pamphlet that takes on the MFA/AWP/etc industry alongside bookstore workers' struggles and efforts at constructing viable oppositional spaces (for poetry & pedagogy) outside the academy.
