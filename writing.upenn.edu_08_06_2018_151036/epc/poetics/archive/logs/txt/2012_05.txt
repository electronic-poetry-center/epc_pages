The Occupy Wall Street Poetry Collective (Occupy Poetry) will be sponsori=
ng
two events (and possibly a third) on May Day as part of the city-wide
celebration of a "Day Without the 99%" in NYC.
=20
* 11:00 am to 1:00 pm in Bryant Park--POETS' CORNER
    The format for this will be a bit different from our usual "Poetry
Assembly." The idea is to have a continuous reading if possible during th=
is
time, with poets taken in the order they arrive and sign up. Look for the=

sign in the park for our location.=20
=20
* 3:30 pm in Union Square--POETRY ASSEMBLY
    This will be the traditional PA, with folks putting their names in a =
hat
and reading for three minutes when their names are called. We are holding=
 it
immediately preceding the unity rally at Union Square which is scheduled =
to
start at 4:00.
=20
* 7:30 pm (tentative)--PARTICIPATORY POETRY PROJECTION

Selected Canticles
George Elliott Clarke

    You took the sea-green road
    and made it incarnadine:
    A whole continent became as painful
    As an occupied crucifix.
    Your skull-faced disciples,
    as wrathful as weather,
    wallowed in wet blood
    and dust of dry blood;
    obsequious to Violence,
    they served their brown hosts
    the milk of gall and sea-salt of tears.
    (War goes wild at whiff of blood.)

    Were you God-fearing seafarers,
    or conquistadors
    (the basic tenants of your faith),
    oh dove of Christ,
    who emerged, clad in fire,
    from the shuddering sea?

“One of the poets in this book speaks of ‘First Breath’ and ‘Last Breath.’
Here are American poets who have “breathed in” the breath of such Chinese
poets as T’ao Ch’ien, Han Shan, and Wang Wei. And here they breathe it back
out again where it mingles with the breath of America.”
        Jonathan Chaves, Translator and professor of Chinese
---
T’ao Ch’ien (365-427 C.E.) is a major figure in the Chinese poetic
tradition whose influence on subsequent generations cannot be overstated.
Like T’ao Ch’ien’s poems, those collected here reflect a viewpoint on life
and society from outside the mainstream.   The five contributors poems are
plain spoken, clear, generally short, and readily understandable, yet
deeply philosophical.  They explore the poets’ states of consciousness and
relationship with the natural world as they seek a self-understanding, as
well as a connectedness with the wider world that surrounds them.  When
these poets address political issues, they see through the smoke and
mirrors of officialdom and are critical of social injustice.

New Truck driver for May

Big thanks go to Lynda Schor for taking care of Truck during April. (In
addition to showing us four of her fine stories, she kicked all the tires,
changed the oil, and checked all fluid levels.)

At the wheel of Truck during May will be David Graham. The keys are over
the sun visor, David. Buen viaje.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Friends:

1. After a long winter the Fox is rustling the leaves. Just in time for MAY
DAY afternoon, Whiskey & Fox Parks and Occupation No. 3 it out, being
distributed by hand amongst May Day actions in NYC, and available for
download from http://whiskeyandfox.org.

No. 3 features work from Robin Clarke, Chris Miller, Christine Remein,
Gracie Leavitt and RJ Maitland, Jeff T. Johnson, Joshua Zelesnick, Daniel
C. Remein, and Gerry Loose. To return again to Jack Spicer: "The music/ Is
right though. The lemon tree/ Could branch off into real magic. Each flower
in place. We/ Were sickened by the old lemon."

2. Whiskey & Fox still has some more work we are hoping to publish in yet
another Parks and Occ. issue. Just because the insurgency of democracy and
anarcho-pacifism and public assembly and occupation has hibernated and may
or may not proceed with the inertia we would want does not mean that we
should not continue to faithfully decorate the parks of the new democracy
to come, or, alternately, by contiguously affixing poesis to spaces and
places, making/occupying more and more space as parkspace. More issues will
be contingent on enough work (read, MORE work) coming our way of sufficient
intensity and commitment; work that can invent a new sincerity and sustain
a new endurance in order that we can continue this work beyond the initial
burst of last autumn.

Strike!

The Carol Novack Tribute Issue

 This newest issue of Mad Hatters' Review is dedicated to the memory of our=
 tempestuous founder, Carol Novack, and features over 100 writers, poets, f=
ilm-makers, artists, musicians and genre-benders.

As you've come to expect from us, styles and approaches vary wildly, from t=
he agnostically eclectic to the godly lyrical. Our creators are emergent, e=
merged or imminent, yet they all hold the one thing in common: they are con=
stantly reinventing themselves in their pursuit of a deeper unknown.

This issue's special section is Carol Novak's Traveling Circus, which aside=
 from a medley of performing creatures from Carol's mythical memoirs, Giraf=
fes in Hiding, also showcases a great number of pieces written for Carol by=
 her friends and fellow artists. There's also a potpourri of Carol's newer =
works that only just now get to see the light of day.

MHR 13 features the work of:

Carol Novack ~ Wilton Azevedo ~ BacBacLove ~ CamillE Bacos ~ Manoj Baviskar=
 ~ James Belflower ~ Stefanie Bennett ~ Ann Bogle ~ Doug Bond ~ Tom Bradley=

Please take a look at the latest essay in our series "Regular
Expressions as a System of Poetic Notation" by Dan Waber. The piece
previously appeared in P-Queue in 2008. In the essay, Waber shows how
patterns and syntax from the fields of mathematics & computing might
open up interesting fields of possibility for expression in poetry.

If you'd like to read Dan Waber's essay plus other essays, rants,
interviews & reviews, please visit www.angelhousepress.com and click on
essays.
& if you  have a word or two to say about poetry, fiction, arts,
creative non fiction, alternative culture, please send your piece to me
for consideration in the series. i'm always looking for work that
continues the conversation of creativity...

Subject:      Andrew Suknaski: July 30, 1942-May 3, 2012

We are sad to report that Chaudiere author Andrew Suknaski, from our
perpetually-forthcoming selected poems, has died in Moose Jaw of natural
causes. From Sarah Simison:

    We are very sorry to report the death of Andy Suknaski in Moose Jaw on
    May 3, 2012. While Andy was most famous for WOOD MOUNTAIN POEMS, he first
    came to fame in Al Purdy's anthology of new writers, STORM WARNING. Andy
    was a strong believer in the small press movement, and early published
    such writers as Gary Hyland, Sid Marty and Glen Sorestad; he also
    influenced a whole generation of prairie writers with his own books of
    gritty, realistic poetry. Many writers owe a debt to him.

Hi all,

Papers for the Border is a podcast series that showcases seldom heard and
experimental music, with the occasional spoken word piece thrown in (past
episodes have included recordings by Jaap Blonk, Charles Bernstein, and
Susan Howe & David Grubbs). But this episode is all poetry (albeit often
set to music). It includes a rare performance by Steve Lacy with Anne
Waldman, and recordings exclusively made for PFTB by Susana Gardner and
Aaron Belz.

Here's the link to the blog which has the program list and the link to the
podcast itself:
http://pftbpodcast.wordpress.com/2012/05/04/papers-for-the-border-13-the-poetry-episode/

Enjoy!

Nomados is proud to announce Actualities by Norma Cole Poetry 24 pp ISBN

The best way to glimpse the hurtling world may be out of the corner of one's
eye, when the lucidity of wonder reasserts itself. In Norma Cole's radiant
new work, Actualities, a poet's intelligence courts hazard, misprision and
the incisions of the archaic to draw the ear and the eye toward complex,
thrilling delight-and a quickening journey through the natural history of
perception. Who knew time could be banished and the senses tempted so? I
predict that you'll want to return to Actualities often-even the title is
richly layered-and that it will be with growing urgency and admiration.

Dear Friends:


I'm super excited to announce the release of a new Compline chapbook=2C Ele=
ni Stecopoulos's Daphnephoria. Over the course of the year=2C I hope to pri=
nt completely letterpress micro-run chapbooks as a way to highlight brand n=
ew work by some of my favorite poets=2C while also raising money for more e=
xpensive full-length projects. My plan is to treat these books as press fun=
draisers: to make them using mostly recyclable material completely by hand=
=2C while selling them for a ludicrously cheap price to inspire interest an=
d support from local poetry communities.=20

Eleni Stecopoulos is the author of the totally wonderful Palm Press long-pl=
ayer Armies of Compassion=2C and the world's foremost expert of the Poetics=
 of Healing (according to me!). By purchasing this book=2C you'll get a gli=
mpse at what Eleni's currently working on (like=2C right now!) while direct=
ly helping to support the next two Compline projects=3B the long-awaited ed=
ition of Leslie Scalapino and Kiki Smith's The Animal is in the World like =
Water in Water and David Brazil's first full-length collection=2C Economy. =
And to make it even more appealing=2C I've decided to try a two-price model=
: if you live in the Bay Area and you can get the book from me personally=
=2C it will only cost you $5 (I know!! Nuts=2C right?! This is the price of=
 a coffee drink these days!). If you'd like the book shipped (even if you'r=
e local)=2C it will cost you $8. This is not=2C of course=2C to punish frie=
nds and colleagues living out of state=2C but to try to keep the price down=
 for folks I might see in person around town. It is also to inspire us to a=
ctually say hello to each other and share a moment of camaraderie in an oth=
erwise completely inhospitable world!

I'd also like to make it easy to give these books as gifts to friends (and =
they're worth it=2C I'm telling you!)=2C so buy one for a friend and I'll i=
nclude a little personal note from you! This might be the perfect time to r=
emind someone you're thinking about them by sending them a badass chapbook =
in the mail!=20

Also=2C it's a super short run=2C so get it while you can!=20

So=2C if you'd like to get the book from me in person (at a reading=2C or a=
t my house=2C or at some clandestine location)=2C and you'd like to spend $=
5 to get something rad while supporting the work I do with the press:=20


CLICK HERE!


If you'd like me to send the book to you=2C and you're willing to spend $8 =
of your hard-earned money to support often-not-super-commercially-viable po=
etries (!!)=2C click the button below:=20

CLICK HERE!

You can also pick up the book by visiting our website here!

=20

Spread the word=2C please=2C to friends and family! We appreciate the suppo=
rt!=20


All best=2C

"Steve Kulash & other autopsies" a chapbook by Catherine Owen

In "Steve Kulash & other autopsies" Catherine Owen offers poems which
portray leaps, misfits & the wild. Yet these poems are rooted in
ordinary moments or finding beauty & ecstasy in the ordinary. Owen
populates her poems with both desolate and  lush landscapes, graffiti,
fire & grief. She uses language that appeals to all the senses. She is
sensitive to sound as demonstrated by the exquisite musicality and
rhythm of the lines. She is a close observer. It is as if Owen holds a
magnifying glass to life and is reporting on its intricate details,
translating them into poignant imagery and metaphor. These poems are in
part empathetic  explorations of the nature of grief and an attempt at
solace, an attempt at joy, at persevering. Side by side with images of
emptiness & incompletion are joyous contortions of language,
Whack-A-Mole, buttons popped open, Beaujolais and  Betty Boop. When I
first heard these poems, I was struck by how imaginative and intense
they were, and how I responded to them with understanding, with a
feeling of relief at not being alone.

Dear Poet and/or Friend of Poets and/or others,

I've probably written to you about this before. But I'm on the board of
a great organization called Small Press Distribution (the only
non-profit distributor of literary books left in the entire country). It
basically keeps US literatures alive in this bad time.

SPD is doing a celebrity spelling bee--called the "Bee-In, A Spelling
Bee to Benefit SPD--on May 14th at the Crown Point Gallery in San
Francisco to raise a little money.

If you are in the Bay Area, it would be great if you would join me there.

This year Sedge Thomson will be the emcee again and thriller writer Cara
Black returns to spell and then there will be all new spellers including
Dennis J. Bernstein, longtime front line reporter specializing in Human
Rights (and newly minted poet!), Cy Musiker, a reporter familiar to
radio audiences in the Bay Area and beyond; novelist Joshua Mohr;
Carolina De Robertis whose novel *Perla* is just out to rave reviews;
treasured Bay Area poet D.A. Powell; and John Jay Osborn, Jr., author of
recently reprinted and perennial bestselling *Paper Chase*, among many
others.

There will be tasty treats from ThirstyBear, Semifreddis and "Terroir"
gin (inspired by Mt. Tam) from St. George Spirits for genuine Bee's Knees
cocktails, along with wine from Kermit Lynch. There's also a Silent
Action with fancy restaurant certificates, theater and music tickets,
art, books,
hotel stays and much more.

The bee is Monday, May 14th. The Crown Point Gallery is at 20 Hawthorne
Street in San Francisco. Doors open at 6:30. The Bee starts at 7:30 and
goes for about an hour.

Get tickets & more info about our infamous spellers here:

http://www.spdbooks.org/pages/events/default.aspx
<http://www.spdbooks.org/pages/events/default.aspx>

If you are not in the Bay Area, please consider donating or becoming a
member. Information on how to donate is here:

Subject:      the canadian prose poem; query,

For the sake of my own interest, and to perhaps answer my own questions on
the subject, Im working on an essay on the Canadian prose poem (as opposed
to the American prose poem, which appears to have a well-known tradition
and trajectory). Im wondering if anyone out there is aware of essays,
reviews, interview and/or other works that might help me track this
elusive Canadian beast? How did we get to where we are now?

Im thinking of contemporary writers working with the prose-poem and/or
prose-line such as Meredith Quartermain, Sina Queyras, Sylvia Legris, Lisa
Robertson, Daphne Marlatt and Rob Budde. Is this a matter of 1960s-era
French-Canadian influence, translations of Nicole Brossard, for example?

Any suggestions would be appreciated. A big subject, I know.

Thanks

Hi all -

*quarter after* - A Place for Art and its Reasons - has just recently
released its issuu page, which can be viewed here
http://issuu.com/quarterafter  Our first issue up and is also on our site
http://quarterafter.org/.  Issue no. 1 features a stellar lineup featuring:

*Adam Fieled * Chad Scheel * David Berridge * Michael Farrell * Jane
Joritz-Nakagawa * Tiffany Monroe * Felino A. Soriano * Vernon Frazer * rob
mclennan * Donna Kuhn * Merlin Flower * Christina Baker-Jones * David
Harrison Horton  * Lawrence Upton * Ric Carfagna * Roger Sedarat * Seekers
of Lice * James Sanders  * Linda Neiswender
*
be sure to check it out

Also, quarter after is starting an artist interview/dialogue series which
will presented in the same way as the journal - on the site, on line and in
print - all published by quarter after press.  If any of you are interested
please let me know.  I have a couple of poets and visual artists already
lined up and one of the interviews will be up on the site shortly.  I say
"dialogue" because I don't have set questions, but would rather us have a
conversation.

And the last note, *quarter after press* has officially launched (
http://quarterafter.org/quarter-after-press/).  If you have something you
are looking to publish, send it over.

All the best in creating,
Calvin Pennix

I attempt to read a paragraph of Charles Bernstein's defense of Gertrude
Stein against Barbara Will. If I'm reading it right, this paragraph may
be claiming that poetry and history are written in different kinds of
language, with different ethical demands to make on us readers.

In a kaleidoscope of shifting voices, James Maughn embraces world poetry in
his immensely creative new collection. Maughn's poems unlock new ways for
us to think about voice, poetic interactions, and the structures of free
verse. Each poem is written 'following' the work of another poet, either a
contemporary writer or a recent translation from earlier literature. "These
Peripheries" tenderly and with great skill, create a formal and nuanced
conversation on contemporary poetics. Maughn's  poems, traversing
geographies and cultural locations, unsettle the concept of translation as
a concrete, fixed mirror and opens it up, like the door of a bird cage,  to
immense possibilities, infinitely expanding the journey of both the new
poems and the source poems. It is a stunning collection which takes a new
shape every time I  come to read it. =97*Judy Halebsky*

Announcing a reading/lecture/one-night installation, by the Organism for
Poetic Research, a newish happening in poetics. The event is sponsored by
the Hollow Earth Society at the Observatory in Gowanus.

Lab and Field Reports for the Organism for Poetic Research/ PELT 1 Release:

The Organism for Poetic Research (OPR) consists of exactly what its name
says it does. The publication PELT **constitutes its epidermal organ, its
interface with the world. Operating at the crux of empirical and humanist
methodologies, fascinated with differentiation, the OPR has been studying
the problem of the Skin of Space as an important political effort.

This event marks the release of the first volume of *PELT*, titled =91The
Skin of Space,=92 and heralds the occasion with the presentation of
additional field and lab reports on the subject, in the form of poetry,
lecture, and findings presented in printed graphic arts. Lovely limited

Beasts, Monsters, Creatures, and Cyborgs:
An Anthology of Post-Human Poetry

In the twenty-first century poetry interfaces with animal-machine. The
"human" is not a given concept, but rather is one that is made in an
ongoing technological and anthropological process. We hope to publish an
anthology of poetry that participates in technological, biological,
representational, sexual, political and theoretical post-humanisms.
We're looking for poetry that engages with or is written by animals,
beasts, monsters, immigrants, creatures, aliens, cyborgs, queers such
that it challenges western, enlightenment figurations of the "self" and
"human."

Any contemporary work in English (domestic or translated) that addresses
the post-human is welcome. Please send up to 20 pages of poetry, in
standard format (*.doc, *.docx, *.rtf, *.pdf) to Aaron Apps & Feng Sun
Chen via *[submishmash <http://posthumanpoetry.submishmash.com/submit>]*.

Previously published work is welcome; please include acknowledgements
(if any) and a brief bio with your submission. If you have any questions
please contact us at posthumanpoetry[at]gmail.com

Hi Jonathan=2C

I'm glad you posted this=2C if only because it calls further attention to t=
he Jacket2 feature on the relatively recent (to my knowledge) charge that G=
ertrude Stein was a Vichy collaborator.  For those interested=2C note that =
links appear in the Jacket2 feature both to defenses of Stein as well as to=
 the attacks which the authors of said defenses are responding to.  In othe=
r words=2C readers who are willing have all the resources necessary to make=
 up their own minds by going to the Jacket2 page=2C which you link to.

Your response to Bernstein is=2C of course=2C only to his introduction to t=
he "dossier" featured in that journal (which consists of essays by Burns=2C=
 Burns & Dydo=2C Retallack=2C Perloff. and Bernstein=2C as well as to addit=
ional materials).  While your point is well taken on Bernstein's use of cli=
ch=E9s=97 at least two=2C in that brief introduction=97 that point is a sty=
listic one=2C and ignores his main claim that "[m]ost of these [recent] art=
icles [attacking Stein] are written by authors who are hostile to Stein's
 literary works and who admit to their inability (and unwillingness) to=20
read her work=2C including the works by Stein that directly address the=20
issue at hand.  In this Stein dossier=2C key documents are provided that re=
fute the=20
sensational tabloid accounts of Stein's activities=2C views=2C and=20
affiliations during the war years."

While Bernstein here is arguably being slightly heavy handed in his loaded =
reference to "sensational tabloid accounts=2C" your analysis hardly comes o=
ff better=2C I'm afraid.  For instance=2C you write=97 presumably referring=
 to the lack of "reference" in CB's poetry=97 that "[a]s a career move=2C t=
hat has been a winner for Bernstein."  But the text you're responding to is=
n't one of his poems at all=2C so what do the signature moves of his poetry=
=2C much less his career=2C really have to do with a dossier on Stein's war=
 years?  Or are you arguing that his essay=97 and=2C by extension=2C all of=
 the essays in the dossier=97 are similarly nonreferential=2C or somehow gu=
ilty by association?  I note also that you mention at least two Bernstein p=
oems specifically=2C while avoiding discussion of any of the other essays i=
n the dossier=2C nor of any of the claims made in response to the recent at=
tacks on Stein.

While your response to Bernstein seems ultimately rooted in some of his abo=
ve-mentioned signature "moves=2C" containing as it does a punchline (c.f. h=
is poem "Of Time and the Line=2C" which you mention)=2C the subject of the =
dossier is hardly a laughing matter.  The issue is not Bernstein=2C but Ste=
in=97 and collaboration is a serious charge.  If there is equally serious e=
vidence that this great writer=2C who was at once an elderly Jewish lesbian=
 and a fairly wealthy patron of the arts=2C was indeed a collaborator=2C th=
en let it be brought forward and examined fairly.  Apart from a cryptic ref=
erence to "a powerful Nazi crook named Bernard Fa=FF=2C" you decline to bri=
ng forward or refer to any such damning evidence yourself=2C much less to t=
urn the focus of your discussion from messenger to message.

While the questions raised about Gertrude Stein's role in Vichy France call=
 for=2C and deserve=2C serious response=2C I'm sorry to say that I find you=
r post to be distracted by issues which strike me as extraneous=2C at best.

Yours in dialogue=2C

Mark DuCharme

Johnathan, Charles is right. The Steins did survive World War II in France;
but this survival did not mean surviving the concentration camp or living
in a barn in some body's farm. If I remember correctly they spent those
years in a house with a garden about which Gertrude Stein herself writes
some place outside Paris. You are write, they obtained the house through
some German "friends (is that the guy Fey?). If I also remember correctly,
in the same text, Stein underplays the threat the Germans occupying France
represent though she doesn't outright deny it.

I don't think the issue here is denying the value of Stein's writing. Her
crucial place in literature is obvious, and it is equally obvious her
stunning originality was not appreciated by publishers of her time. In that
strict sense she is like Emily Dickinson. On the other hand, in most other
ways, she lived the life of a privileged, rich person, running a salon,
admired by artists, writers and poets who later turned out to be central
historical figures and also protected, it seems, by at least one
"enlightened" Nazi collaborator.

Ciao,

Murat

You are invited to participate in
THE HUMAN MICROPOEM

SUNDAY, MAY 20th
from 11am-12pm
at the corner of Jackson & Columbus
in Chicago, Illinois

Bring one poem 5 minutes in length to be read aloud
or just come & be part of the chorus -- all welcome!

The Human Micropoem is a call and response choral form utilizing the human microphone at the occupy movements to amplify the speaker's words by those listening. The speaker says a line and then everyone who can hear repeats it.

This event is part of the March and Rally to Protest NATO
http://cang8.wordpress.com

Join in a legal, permitted, family-friendly march and rally! Starting at noon at Petrillo Bandshell, the Iraq Veteran's Against the War (IVAW) will be marching with us in solidarity. At the end of the march, within sight and sound of McCormick Place, members of IVAW will conduct the closing ceremony where they will return their medals to NATO. It will be a moving event, and not to be missed.

S=E9bastien Smirou
MY LORENZO
translated from the French by Andrew Zawacki
Poetry, 120 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 978-1-936194-08-7  original paperback $14

MY LORENZO is an elegant, funny, often sad meditation on the =
fifteenth-century Italian statesman, art patron, and poet Lorenzo de =
Medici. Obliquely and eccentrically narrated, it is as concerned with =
physical arrangement as it is with linguistic ambiguity and matters =
philosophical, political, and sentimental. MY LORENZO is striking =
visually for its justified  stanzas and tableau-like shape. Reading the =
book is akin to touring the Uffizi, its Renaissance paintings hung =
meticulously on  the walls.
     MY LORENZO combines traditional form with an unapologetically =
modern idiom that draws on pop culture and shuttles vertiginously =
between theoryspeak and speakeasy slang.
     (This work, published as part of a program providing publication =
assistance, received financial support from the French Ministry of =
Foreign Affairs, the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in the =
United States and FACE [French American Cultural Exchange]).

     S=C9BASTIEN SMIROU was born in 1972 in Niort. After earning a =
degree in journalism, he studied at the =C9cole des Hautes =C9tudes en =
Sciences Sociales, where he enrolled in Roubaud=92s course in formal =
poetics. He founded the press "=E9ditions rup & rud," coedits the =
magazine LIGNE 13, and has translated a number of American poets into =
French. Smirou is the author of three volumes of poetry, all published =
by P.O.L.: UN TEMPS POUR S=92=C9TREINDRE UN TEMPS POUR SE S=C9PARER =
(2011), BEAU VOIR (2008), and our present volume, MON LAURENT (2003). =
Smirou is a psychoanalyst, with a specialization in working with =
troubled children. He lives in Montrouge, on the outskirts of Paris.
=20
     ANDREW ZAWACKI is the author of three poetry books=97PETALS OF ZERO =
PETALS OF ONE (Talisman House), ANABRANCH (Wesleyan), and BY REASON OF =
BREAKINGS (Georgia). Coeditor of VERSE and of THE VERSE BOOK OF =
INTERVIEWS, he has published criticism in the TLS, BOSTON REVIEW, HOW2, =
edited AFTERWARDS: SLOVENIAN WRITING 1945-1995 (White Pine) and =
co-translated Ale=9A Debeljak=92s WITHOUT ANESTHESIA (forthcoming from =
Persea). He teaches at the University of Georgia.=

Thanks very much for your helpful comments, Mark and Murat. Let me
dispose of a few technicalities at the beginning and then try to make my
original point more clearly.

The technicalities:

-- Murat writes, ["Stein's] stunning originality was not appreciated by
publishers of her time. In that strict sense she is like Emily
Dickinson." Actually, at least one influential editor (Thomas Niles of
Roberts Brothers, later Little, Brown) begged Dickinson for a
manuscript, and she ignored his repeated pleas. Likewise, her childhood
friend Helen Hunt Jackson, one of America's best known women of letters
during the second half of the nineteenth century, wrote her a letter
that said,

"You are a great poet -- and it is a wrong to the day you live in, that
you will not sing aloud. When you are what men call dead, you will be
sorry you were so stingy." (Dickinson, _Letters_, ed. Thomas H. Johnson,
no. 444a)

Dickinson ignored that one too.

-- Bernard Faÿ wasn't a German but a Frenchman, and altogether an
amazing person. France's leading expert on American literature, he wrote
a very good brand of English indeed in the pages of Eugène Jolas's
_transition_ before Jolas broke with Stein, and yes it is literally true
that he saved Stein's life during World War II. In gratitude to him,
Alice Toklas converted to Catholicism after Stein's death. At the same
time, it's also true that he didn't need the house in which he sheltered
Alice and Gertrude because he was otherwise occupied with sending Masons
to concentration camps. You'll encounter him toward the end of his glory
days in Céline's _Castle to Castle_, holed up like a rat with Céline,
Pierre Laval, and the rest of the last of Vichy's bitter-enders.

And a footnote I learned from Barbara Will: after the war, among his
nest of Nazis in Fribourg, Faÿ took under his patronage Marcel Lefebvre,
later to go on to Vatican-defying, Holocaust-denying fame with the
Société St. Pius X. No Gertrude Stein, no Mel Gibson!

As to my own biographical take on Stein, I hardly have one. She was
hardly the only American author of German Jewish descent to feel
embarrassed or distressed or even pained by her genealogy. Nathanael
West had that problem and dealt with it interestingly, by hiding behind
a mask until it killed him. (Nobody expects a man named Nathan Weinstein
to be a reckless driver, so when Nathan Weinstein changed his name he
also started driving so recklessly that his friends refused to get into
his car. Not long afterward, as these things go, he drove through a stop
sign, and that was that for Nathanael West. He was 37.) By contrast,
Walter Lippmann, the father of modern media punditry, was less
interesting. He attempted to pass like Anatole Broyard, and to even hint
to him that you knew he was Jewish was to break off all communication
with him, forever. Stein may have had a similar problem, but of course
her language brings out all the complications and ambiguities.

Which is to say that she was a great poet. But surely (this is a modest
enough idea, isn't it?) none of us is going to claim that being a good
(i.e., competent) artist is the same as being a good (i.e., virtuous)
person.

And surely the example of Bernstein's language means that we aren't
warranted in reading Bernstein or Will or Stein or anybody else as if
they were journalists, uttering clichés but asking us not to listen to
them. Oh, if only the sign that Nathanael West drove through had said
not "Stop" but "Aporia."

I think it may be the same kind of micro-reading that I fasten onto
Bernstein's clichés.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Hi,

I love Charles project. I read nearly every article. What I did gather from
all of it is that it is truth that Stein was friends with Bernard Fay, she
translated text, and she and Alice moved during the war were they were
protected by villagers who they knew and were loved by. No one has provided
any information (but I'm a dense reader) as to whether Stein knew Fay's
status, supported Hitler, or why she did the translatation or if doing a
translation makes her a sympathizer (has anyone read Chronicles of the
Guaki Indians/Auster is not a cannibal to my knowledge). To me, and again,
I might be silly. To say that the infamous quote means that she was
pro-Hilter, grammatically would mean that she was utterly anti-Left and
anti-democratic, was she? I know she was republican, but anti-democratic?

There are a few things that fascinate me.

1. That when the show was in San Francisco there was relatively no hoopla.
I did find a few articles. But in New York is become a huge controversy and
was in the Daily News and CBS. It really infiltrated into popular culture.
It alarmed me tho that people all over were making a judgement of someone
whose work and life they knew nothing about.

2. I do have to say that Stein's self-preservation make me think. Could I
act the same? Could fear or self-importance lead me to sit in my house
while Jewish children and gays and disabled people and their Catholic
sympathizers where being burned in ovens?

3. Yesterday, Jeff & I went to the show to see what was up. The MET did
change the sign in the show. They folded to their benefactors. However, the
sign merely said something to the effect of Stein was friends with Fay who
helped her during the war. In the Met's defense, they kept the issue both
brief and factual. I also have to say that I was the BEST collection I've
ever seen, and made me cry. I was not prepared for it to be so great. It
closes in 2 weeks (I think) and everyone who can, should.

4. After seeing the companion show in San Fransisco, I formed the opinion
(which I am still forming) that despite her writing and the great Mother of
Us All. I cannot consider Stein a feminist. Here marriage was a patriarchy
of the worst kind, she kept the company of largely men, and other than the
Mother Of Us All, I can't see how her work advanced the plight of woman at
all. Instead, to me, she was a strong brilliant woman (a genius really) who
functioned within and perhaps even lauded the patriarchy.  A super-great
writer, yes. A feminist or kind person, not necessarily.

*Call for Submissions:

Beasts, Monsters, Creatures, and Cyborgs:
An Anthology of Post-Human Poetry*
*
*
*In the twenty-first century poetry interfaces with animal-machine. The
=93human=94 is not a given concept, but rather is one that is made in an
ongoing technological and anthropological process. We hope to publish an
anthology of poetry that participates in technological, biological,
representational, sexual, political and theoretical post-humanisms. We=92re
looking for poetry that engages with or is written by animals, beasts,
monsters, immigrants, creatures, aliens, cyborgs, and queers such that it
challenges western, enlightenment figurations of the =93self=94 and =93huma=
n.=94

Any contemporary work in English (domestic or translated) that addresses
the post-human is welcome. Please send up to 20 pages of poetry, in
standard format (*.doc, *.docx, *.rtf, *.pdf) to Aaron Apps & Feng Sun Chen
via [submishmash <http://posthumanpoetry.submishmash.com/submit>].

Previously published work is welcome; please include acknowledgements (if
any) and a brief bio with your submission. If you have any questions please
contact us at posthumanpoetry[at]gmail.com

Please feel free to forward this call via your e-mail, blog, facebook,

Robert Hogg was born in Edmonton, Alberta on March 26, 1942. When the
child was nine, his father bought a ranch in the Cariboo region in the
interior of British Columbia, where the family spent three years; from
there they moved to Burnaby, and later Abbotsford and Langley in the
Fraser Valley where Hogg finished high school in 1960. He spent the next
four years in the English and Creative Writing program at the University
of British Columbia where he came into contact with the Black Mountain
poets and their poetics and participated in the Tish poetry movement.
After graduating in the spring of 1964 Hogg hitch-hiked to Toronto,
visited the poet, Charles Olson, in Buffalo, and applied to study under
him in the graduate program of the English Department of the State
University of New York. Hogg later wrote his doctoral dissertation on
Olson under the supervision of Robert Creeley. He completed the course
work for the PhD in the spring of 1968 and accepted a position at Carleton
University in Ottawa where he taught Modern and Post-Modern American and
Canadian Poetry and Poetic Theory until his retirement in 2005.

While at Buffalo Hogg met and married Leslie Flaig, then a music major at
the University, who has since become an accomplished artist and
photographer. During the next two decades they raised three children on
their farm in Mountain Township, about 50 kilometres south of Ottawa,
where they grow organic crops and operate a commercial flour mill and
natural food distribution company called Mountain Path Inc. At present,
Hogg is working on a sixth book of poetry, and editing an extensive
anthology of Canadian poetic theory.

Robert Manery studied with Bob Hogg at Carleton University in the 1980s.
In response to Robs complaint about contemporary poetry, Bob suggested
that he should read the language poets. This suggestion led to Robs
continuing interest in the possibilities and limits of meaning-making. It
also led to his collaborations with Louis Cabri, hosting literary events,
including Bob Hoggs seminar on Charles Olsons The Special View of History,
and then publishing hole magazine and hole books. Rob has published one
book of poems, Its Not As If It Hasnt Been Said Before (Tsunami Editions).
He currently teaches academic writing at Simon Fraser University where he
is pursuing a doctorate in education.

*Big Bridge*, Call for Work:



Poetry, Prose, Hybrid Text, Photographs, Artwork, Other

 * ***

*Phenomenology of Giving: a Use Me Capitalism*

* *

Giving was not meant to be the antonym of taking; we=92re talking a
developing act that creates agency and beneficiaries on both sides of the
equation, bringing forth what matters, like some Higgs intelligence
emanating mass. Both source and filters are necessary.



Through abstractions, perspectives, mediation and other cognitive tasks,
explore the vagaries of giving as you bypass mediocrities and
socio-political norms; implore episodes that deliver it, the experience
that challenges it. Plead for thrills and chills that land you at the
shores of its aesthetic and narrative, historically, culturally or
privately. Imitate, improvise or survey to open up to the attention,
intention and cost an act of giving calls for. How do emotions play into
the act, how does love? Address the entanglements it purports and feeds,
the overlaps, the boundaries.

under sound works.  This Internet project dates from 2001--2003.  I wrote
the libretto based on the writings of Joseph Shaw (1829--1865) who was
murdered in Westminster, Maryland because of his involvement with the
Know Nothing gang of Baltimore from 1855--1859.  What ultimately brought
Shaw to his untimely end was a badly timed editorial that appeared on
the eve of Lincoln's assassination in April of 1865.  Shaw hinted that
perhaps Lincoln would make a better president below instead of above
ground.  When news arrived at Westminster, Maryland his presses were
broken, his office set on fire, etc.  Shaw left and returned one week
later to be stabbed to death at the Anchor Hotel by members of the old
Know Nothings that he had tangled with before.  The six men who did Shaw
in were brought to trial in the Westminster Court House and found not
guilty.  The State prosecutor was one Charles Webster, a former Know
Nothing and Shaw's enemy.  All of these circumstances were reflected in
the old newspapers of Carroll County, Maryland, and Baltimore, from
which I developed the narrative and the songs--found poems in fact.

The story is compelling and true, and Bumsteinas' experimental music and
use of the burgeoning Internet of the early part of this century is
highly innovative.

Please do give this sound work a listen:

VERSAL IS TEN
Fall in love with the literary journal all over again
http://www.versaljournal.org/versalten

In the first edition of Versal, published in 2002, founder and editor
Megan M. Garr wrote, "This could be the first and last Versal you ever
read."

But on May 23, 2012, the dazzling tenth Versal, the international
literary and arts annual, was revealed to a full house at Bo Cinq in the
heart of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. This edition is a gold-plated
wonder, with "Versal Ten" embossed on the front in the familiar Versal
typeface. The evening marked the journal's milestone with anecdotes from
its oldest and newest editors and with readings from contributors Ruth
Danon and Laurence Levey, both of whom traveled from the USA for the event.

Among the 168 pages of this anniversary edition are four riddles from
Ish Klein, a conversation between Michael Martone and Matthew Baker, and
a series of "photodrawings" from Irish artist Garrett Phelan. Versal 10
also includes new works from Cody-Rose Clevidence, Erin Costello, Tamar
de Kemp, Roxane Gay, James Grinwis, Dora Malech, Ben Merriman, Rusty
Morrison, Brandon Shimoda, and many others.

For the first time in the journal's history -- perhaps for the first
time in literary journal history -- no two copies of the offset-printed,
full-color Versal 10 are alike. "750 Circles" is a handmade project by
Versal's editorial team to honor the many people around the world who
have made Versal possible.

Both journal and art gallery, this beautiful gold edition of Versal
spans the range of some of today's best writing and art. It is now
available at select bookshops and online at www.versaljournal.org/versalten.


About Versal

Versal is published in Amsterdam each May. Its editors hail from Canada,
Russia, the UK, the USA and the Netherlands, and are led by American
poet Megan M. Garr.

A publication celebrating translocal intersections and cross-cultural
dialogue, Versal is internationally renowned for the quality of work
published by up-and-coming as well as established writers, and for its
strong attention to design and production values.

The Long Poem Library <http://www.revolutionpoesy.com/>

This is a brand new digital library of contemporary long poems by
contemporary poets. It is my fervent hope that the library will grow and
flourish. Aesthetically, the site is intended to be unobtrusive, in order
to showcase the poetry and the poetry alone. The most important factor is,
again, newness!  There are no  rules. There shouldn't be, especially with
poetry. You *are *the library.

Moreover, The Long Poem Library is NOT affiliated with a college or
university, or creative writing program, or to anyone who has pull and sway
within the literary establishment. You do NOT need name recognition or
impressive credentials or a fancy CV to be published here.  Everyone is
welcome.

Granary Books Announces: Bean Spasms by Ted Berrigan, Ron Padgett and =
Joe Brainard

Ted Berrigan, Joe Brainard and Ron Padgett's Bean Spasms is the defining =
publication of the 1960s literary/Pop scene in New York. Originally =
published in 1967 by Kulchur Press in an edition of 1,000, and =
out-of-print for more than 40 years, Bean Spasms is a book many have =
heard about but relatively few have seen, and which-until now-has been =
shrouded in legend.

The text is comprises collaborations between poets Ted Berrigan and Ron =
Padgett, with further writings, illustrations and cover by artist and =
writer Joe Brainard. The three began collaborating in 1960, and kept a =
folder of their works titled "Lyrical Bullets" (a humorous homage to the =
well-known collaboration between Coleridge and Wordsworth, "Lyrical =
Ballads"). As Ron Padgett describes, in his introduction to this new =
facsimile edition, their collaborations included "plays, a fictitious =
correspondence, a picaresque novel, goofy interviews and poems of =
various types and lengths, as well as mistranslations and parodies of =
each other's work and the work of others."=20

Poet friends dropping by during writing sessions would also add lines, =
and although Berrigan and Padgett also contributed visuals, and Brainard =
contributed texts, all works in the book were intentionally left =
unattributed. Full of wild wit and joy in experimentation, competition =
and collaboration, Bean Spasms is a classic document of the New York =
School.

Dear all,
I would love to get in touch with professor Willard Bohn about my bachelor
paper on Visual Poetry, entitled "Visual Poetry: a semiosphere, with its
own logic and own research domain." It is at this moment written in Dutch
but if professor Bohn, or other professors, researchers, academics, visual
or concrete poets would be interested, I could translate it into English
and send it to them.

Thank you to get in touch with the contact data of professor Willard Bohn.

Best wishes,

Crag Hill=E2=80=99s work inspires all who experience it.  I use the word =
=E2=80=98experience=E2=80=99, not =E2=80=98see=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98read=E2=
=80=99, because that is exactly what it is, a personal encounter that chang=
es us on the inside, gives us a new understanding of language, letter, syll=
able and word.  A single sentence or image cluster can speak in multiple wa=
ys; he gives us the freedom to interpret, and leads us into an alternate re=
ality forged with fire and glowing iron.

Crag and I worked together all through the 1980s, both professionally and a=
rtistically.  We used Crag=E2=80=99s knowledge of cameras and photographic =
techniques to create our shared oeuvre.  I still remember discussing visual=
 poetry in a cramped cluttered dirty little room underneath Mission Street,=
 south of Market, San Francisco.  Directly over our heads, while we babbled=
 at one another, there were the sounds of walking feet, car tires, bus exha=
ust, camera vacuum and everything else you would find in a throbbing metrop=
olitan center.  It was all totally electric.

So, on to this series:  diversity in unity, unity in diversity.  This work =
makes me go up and down on my computer screen, stopping here and there to c=
ontemplate, even to laugh with giddy delight.  What=E2=80=99s it made of?  =
Primordial stew.  Tomorrow=E2=80=99s neural nets.  Conscious bacteria.  Fla=
ming future alphabets. Beautiful tendrils.  New death.  Everything flowing,=
 reaching, sprouting. =E2=80=98Shih shih wu ai=E2=80=99- between things no =
obstructions.  One of my favorite pieces is #14 Maw.  White becomes the maj=
or focus, drawing your eyes, bursting over the space/tan background.  The b=
lack, with just the right amount of visual weight, serves to ground it all.=
  There=E2=80=99s rain, there are creatures raising their chins in both def=
iance and joy.

That=E2=80=99s Crag- defiance and joy.  You see the defiance in his work, h=
ow he refuses to follow any fad or fashion, how he bends his materials to h=
is own end, how he makes them laugh and cry.   You see the joy in- well, ev=
erything.  So check this out; all will become clear, and you will be the be=
tter for it.       =20

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CMemory Fictions=E2=80=9D by =
Lawrence Upton
=20
Description:
=20
"Memory Fictions" continues Lawrence Upton's (in his own word) restless inv=
estigation of renewing approaches to poetry. It is, in part, also a record =
of his recent formal exploration of notation (in this case of texts for two=
 voices) to disambiguate typed text without being overly directive. The wor=
k is an affirmation by Upton of the importance of performance as the full r=
ealisation of a poem; poems written and presented to support performers inh=
erently; and, in its structures and composition, it represents, though quie=
tly, a new direction in his writing.

New release from Plastique Press:=20
HONEY IS A SHE, a collection of poetry by Lina ramona Vitkauskas

"Vitkauskas=92 poems possess the intricate peculiarity of honeycombs and =
Schiaparelli dresses, as she exquisitely fashions poems out of =
scientific particulars, cinematic references ('they place the horse head =
in the bed'), and metaphors=92 associative logic. 'These girls are brave =
tailors in the blur of impossible femme,' and like her own subject, =
Vitkauskas is fearless as she navigates, interrogates, and ultimately, =
dislocates conventional gender dynamics: 'I rip the itch from gender.' =
The dynamism, humor, and marvel of her poems recall the surrealist Joyce =
Mansour, conveying a similar tenor as they negotiate desire and disease, =
ardor and animosity, with beehive fervor. Be stung and sung in the =
'golden / drip science' of her resplendent poems."

--Simone Muench, author of Orange Crush (Sarabande, 2010)

"Splendid, grotesque, violent, but always loving, Lina ramona Vitkauskas =
writes like a contemporary Marina Tsvetaeva through a landscape of the =
uncertain and surreal; the language is made from the nervousness and =
energy of every bee in the hive. Part =93rotten aorta=94 and part =
=93snapdragon wine=94, the poems in HONEY IS A SHE form a buzzing =
network of inventive beauty.=94

--Sandra Simonds, author of Mother was a Tragic Girl (Cleveland State =
University Poetry Center, 2012)=20

              Only 9 Days Left!
Comments: To: Michael Rothenberg <walterblue@bigbridge.org>

Dear Friends of 100 Thousand Poets for Change,



Good news! We have exceeded our
Kickstarter<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/377638302/100-thousand-poets-for-change-headquarters-event>fundraising
campaign goal and we still have ten more days left to keep
raising funds.



We greatly appreciate all your generous support!

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/377638302/100-thousand-poets-for-change-headquarters-event



As you can imagine it takes a lot more than $2,500 to run a global
campaign. As you know, we set our original goal for $2,500. And we set our
fundraising goal for Kickstarter pretty low knowing it is a hard time in
our economy to be asking for money.



The additional funds that we receive by the end of the campaign on June 7th
will help us expand the 100 Thousand Poets for Change event overall.



We have until June 7th, just 9 more days in our 100TPC Fundraising Campaign
and we can't wait until it's over so we can stop asking you for money!



There's a lot of work that goes into organizing 100 Thousand Poets for
Change, ie., building and maintaining the 100tpc.org website, creating and
managing the Livestream hub for September 29th, signing up new organizers
and expanding general community outreach, creating and mailing press
releases to media to over 10,000 media outlets around the world, and of
course, preparing the media archives of all of your events for Stanford
University so that September 29 will be a day documented and remembered in
history.



Please visit our
Kickstarter<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/377638302/100-thousand-poets-for-change-headquarters-event>
campaign
and donate!

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/377638302/100-thousand-poets-for-change-headquarters-event



After our Kickstarter<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/377638302/100-thousand-poets-for-change-headquarters-event>fundraising
campaign is over we will focus entirely on September 29 events,
and work directly with organizers and participants to make sure that the
world knows about all the hard work being done by everyone, and about what
is being accomplished in communities world-wide with poetry, music and art!



Here are just a few examples of the events that we will be able to
broadcast world-wide, with the help of your donations, on our 100 Thousand
Poets for Change Livestream hub.





In *Pasadena, CA* Tibetan poets and musicians will perform to bring *awareness
of the Tibetan culture* that is on the brink of extinction and to raise
concerns about imprisoned poets and writers.



Poets in *Mexico* will organize and broadcast *the first inter-high-school
Spoken Word Fest* in Mexico City.



In *Tunisia* there will be a show on the Avenue Habib BourGuiba with music
and poetry during the day. Children will participate with song as well. A
poetry evening will follow in a cultural-space along with a book
exhibition, and two musical groups.



In *New Orleans, Louisiana* musicians and poets will bring the youth, arts
and music community together, with a day and night of entertainment by *10
blues bands* performing to raise money for the Musicians Clinic, to focus
on providing health and social services support for musicians in need.



A great festival in *Strumica, Macedonia* will bring together poets and
storytellers, musicians and artists from all over the country. In Strumica
they will speak about the many problems they face as a country and *promote
a more peaceful and sustainable planetary cultural heritage* via poetic
actions, readings, workshops and music concerts.



Take a moment in the next few days and donate what you can to our
Kickstarter<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/377638302/100-thousand-poets-for-change-headquarters-event>
campaign, to help us with this year's 100TPC activities.  Together, with
your help, we can make September 29th bigger and better than ever!



Thank you again for your continued support!



Peace,

Michael and Terri

The only thing I can find is his Selected Poems from Black Sparrow.
