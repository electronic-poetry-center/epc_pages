Burt -- It's been 15 years literally since I've been in the Fuller
literature (I think I told the story publicly that doing the dictionary
of his thinking was when I knew I should go to graduate school, and once
I did I never went back).  But it seems to me it's in the opening of
SYNERGETICS.  I frankly no longer have my own materials on hi8m -- only
the books.  Why not go through indexes for "writing" "alphabet" "paper"
(seems to me he said something extremely interesting about the fact that
everyone always ignored the surface, the paper, when they thoughht about
writing).
If you find anything, please share it!

Sandra Braman

Or, hey, post the question on the Buckminster Fuller list that I seem to
have just joined out of curiosity.... want the address?

Meow Press (Joel Kuszai's inventive imprint) has recently published, as a
Meow Press Textbook, TECHNOLOGY/art: 20 Brief Proposals for Seminars on Art
& Technology. These brief proposals were made in 1984 by a group of poets
(Bruce Andrews, Charles Bernstein, and James Sherry), at the request of
Jesse Ausubel, who was then Director of Programs at the National Academy of
Engineering, to increase the dialogue between artists and scientists and
engineers. It was this book which provoked my recent consideration of the
alphabet as a technology.

But thanks for giving me credit, Maria. And the responses provoked of more
ways to look at the art/technology nexus through the writings of a variety
of women have been most welcome.

Sandra Braman, thanks for the notion to look at B. Fuller for comments on
the paper, the "surface" of writing. That appeals to me particularly as a
bookmaker who seems to talk widely about the context of the text, in my
case mostly about the physical contexts of representation. So, yes, I will
find SYNERGETICS and look for remarks on paper. And, if you send the
address of the fuller list, I may put a query there.

Are you still coming to Minneapolis this summer? Can we still get together?

all best,

The modernist focusses on her/his purity, ignoring others' responses,
is loved as unreachable by non-experts eg non-poets for a modernist
poet, non-musicians for a modernist musician, or found intense by
fellow experts - and oneself by oneself by the same logic. But there
is always the need for the "feminine" reader who can see how the
freedom to have time to listen and read and create is endangered and
must be fought for, as a social space (eg Harryman saying she loves
polemicists but can't herself be one as is too busy looking at all
the whole picture, faux polite sarcasm?). You have an intense evening
or year with Bach and feel the fullness not just of Bach as an object,
but of the time he could/did steal to make so much art, of having all
that time to appreciate it - like Joyce responded, it should take you
a lifetime to read Ulysses, it took me a lifetime to write it - but
then maybe it is easier to read something after its author's death,
just because of all sorts of reasons, prime perhaps the socially
required (it seems) need to tease the person who's really ahead while
alive. You have that intense evening or year, then you say "it's human,
albeit a brave human, who can feel like this; many more could if there
were fewer frighteners put on people for them to have to be brave in
defiance of"; and you stop making art and make utopia nearer.
        What kind of utopia, to not be a modernist yourself; to be modern,
not postmodernist either. What Derrida's work does is place itself in this
problem of wanting to, and being hugely sensitively able to, make or
teach art and philosophy; and yet wanting to express this as forever
deferred, while you get on with not becoming the freak who got through
the frighteners, and is personally ok, but instead remind people that you
aren't especially special, everyone's special, and there's too many
frighteners.

Glad to be back in my bed after three weeks in Helsinki and St
Petersburg (checking out Lyn Hejinian's take). Find still by my bed a
recent _Review of Contemporary Fiction_ and, of course, George
Stanley's _Opening Day_, which I have been reading in bed since it
came out a few years ago. A book of poems anyone could benefit from
rereading.

Subject:      Geoffrey Hill/Modernism & PoMo in England

I was intrigued when, in response to a mention of John Ashberry's exam question
comparing an Ern Malley poem to that of a modernist, someone replied "it wasn't
even a modernist, it was Geoffrey Hill". Is there a box into which Hill's
poetry can be slotted? He doesn't seem exactly modernist to me (although Ira's
remark that "The modernist focusses on her/his purity, ignoring others'
responses" could be applied to him), and not postmodernist either.

This seems a general problem with English poets - the easy categorisation into
a modernist/postmodernist tradition that appears less problematic when
considering  American poetry seems to break down for post-war English poetry
(of course, this is a problem with the categorisation rather than with the
poets). Although they followed modernism chronologically, would anyone
categorise the Movement or Group poets as postmodern? It seems rather that
they've taken the MacSpauday strand of modernism and developed a kind of anti-
modernism, whereas the US took the Pound strand and turned it into what most
would categorise as PoMo.

Perhaps postmodernism is an American/European phenomenon, and England (& hence
the Commonwealth) has been left with a more traditional mainstream. In New
Zealand, the boundaries are blurred a little by the fact that many 'amateur'
poetry-lovers complain of the prevalence of what they see as postmodernism in
the journals, when they're really talking of a kind of 'post-Manhirism'
practised by Borholdt/Johnston/Wilkins/Orsman and so on. These poets seem to me
to bear the same relationship to postmodernism as Auden or perhaps Larkin did
to modernism - the experiments of an older generation have been absorbed and
domesticated. Auckland poets such as Michele Leggott, Alan Loney and Wystan
Curnow are perhaps closer to what people on this list would see as
postmodernists, and the mainstream journals seem a little wary of their work
(viz Jane Stafford's review of Leggott's _DIA_ and Murray Edmond's _The
Switch_).

I'm not sure where this leaves me. I started writing poetry in Wellington,
where Bill Manhire is seen as God, and I still have a tremendous admiration for
much of his poetry, but moving to Auckland and joining this list have given me
some idea of what LangPo and postmodernism have to offer. I still think it's
best to read as widely as possible, not restricting oneself to one particular
movement or genre. Leigh Davis, Edwin Morgan, Dinah Hawken, Craig Raine, Karl
Stead, Cilla McQueen, Wallace Stevens, Dennis Lee, Ian Wedde and T.S. Eliot
have all left their traces in me. I've never dared to try writing like Geoffrey
Hill, but his writing moves me immensely. I hope that there will always be room
for poets who span or fall between the boundaries.

        Tom.

An Historical Reprise in Celebration of the Anniversary of Boston
ACT UP
February 26, 1989

Midnight Notes, P.O.Box 204, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts,

INTRODUCTION

WELL, WELL, WELL.  Happy Birth Day, ACT UP, and Many
Happy Returns of the Day!

The AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power has just begun to flex its
muscles.  We are all beginning to feel better in the reflection of your
struggle against AIDS.  Although you may sometimes feel like the
little boy whose thumb in the dike is all that stands between the next
breath and the deluge, your supporters gain courage by your example.

AIDS, like the pestilences before it, has been used as a principle of
division --division between genders, between the races, between the
nations and the continents.  But it has backfired, and the struggle
against it brings us greater power than we knew, for we are
beginning to understand that there is not a single question of
struggle that is not involved in yours.  The struggle against sex and
racial discrimination, the struggle of workers at our places of
employment, the struggle for civil liberties, the struggle for housing,
the struggle to chose our own life-style, the expression of solidarity
with those struggling in Africa, in Haiti, in the Philippines, and in
Latin America, the struggle against medicine-for-profit, the struggle
for education, the struggle for prisoners' rights, the struggle against
identity papers, the struggle to sleep when, where, and with
whomever, the struggle to retain some of the breakthroughs of the
1960s to create our own forms of sociality, the struggle against drug
abuse, the struggle for gay liberation, the struggle for women's
liberation, the struggle for the environment, the struggle for science
for the people, the struggle for sex and the struggle for safe streets,
have gained strength from your vigilance, creativity and staying
power.

Here is a birthday present.  It is a history of ten plagues.  It contains
warnings and danger signals.  It shows us how far we have come.
It is a collective present which could not have been written without
the help of Michaela Brennan, Silvia Federici, George Caffentzis,
Evan Stark, John Wilshire, Monty Neill, Nancy Kelly, Bettina
Berch, Harry Cleaver, John Roosa, Kate Linebaugh, and all the
"whores, sluts and martyrs" who supped on minestrone last Friday
beyond midnight.

So, as they say in San Francisco, "let us go gayly forward".

HIV made its active appearance in the late 1970s in the United
States.  At the same time, in Chicago, an economic theory was
propagated ("monetarism") that organized poverty, famine, disease,
and dislocation all over the world in the interests of the ruling
classes whose corrupt desperation was personified by an aphasic
actor, Ronald Reagan.  Chicago also became a center noted for the
adoption of free-market economic models to the interpretation of law
(Stephan Possner) which ceased to pretend to justice and quantified
instead the cost-benefit of life and death, and such jurists gained
political ascendancy.  Not long after, under the barking leadership of
William Bennett, other dogs of the liberal arts joined the howling
chorus for "Western Civilization".  A Chicago historian, William
McNeill, published PLAGUE AND PEOPLES in 1979, shortly
before the AIDS pandemic appeared.

He takes a long view, indeed the longest view he can, beginning
with "Man the Hunter" and placing "him" within a very deterministic
ecology.  He notes that our survival is contingent upon survival
against micro parasites which inhabit our bodies (bacteria, viruses)
and against macro parasites (ruling classes in their many mutations)
who raid, enslave, exploit, tax, kill, and otherwise mess us up.
Any kind of parasite is dependent upon its host, the HIV no less
than a ruling class, and therefore it is in the interest of the parasite
not to annihilate its host completely, as otherwise, the parasite too is
dead.  A balance, or stasis of some kind, must be accommodated.
The host is permitted to live only to the extent that it works to
produce a surplus for the parasite.

While McNeill does not prattle, as Hitler does in MEIN KAMPF,
about "sacrifice for the race", or "ruthless measures for survival," he
is at ease with that cool distance from events that permits him to
speak of "Nature" and our "species."  Susan Sontag warned against
the metaphorical treatment of disease, and that is a danger McNeill
has not resisted.  He retains a lay person's knowledge of disease
and a Chicago person's knowledge of ruling classes.  He does not,
for all the suggestion of a class analysis of plague and history, tell
us about the lost history of our own communism.  Nor does he
know about the lizard.

1. LIZARD TALK IN ANCIENT EGYPT

"AIDS!" her lips curl about the syllable.  "There is no such thing. It
is a false disease invented by the American government to take
advantage of the poor countries.  The American president hates poor
people, so now he makes up AIDS to take away the little we have."
--Prostitute in Port-au-Prince, quoted in LIFE, August 1987.

What about the famous plagues of ancient Egypt?  They provide an
atavistic component to the whisperings and prayers of the
bourgeoisie.  They are the "fundamentals" of the Fundamentalists.
Did not the Lord of Hosts, the wrathful Yahweh, sling down plague
and pestilence to those who got in the way of the "Chosen People"?
Listen to the voice of the chief physician of the Baptist Mission
Hospital outside of Port-au-Prince (one-third of whose beds are
unoccupied): "Fornication.  It is Sodom and Gomorrah all over
again, so what can you expect from these people?" (LIFE magazine,
August 1987).

In Lutheran, in Calvinist, in Vatican, in Zionist ideological practice,
these are the fool "fundamentals" dividing "darkest Africa" from the
"glory that was Greece", the slave mode of production based upon
the empire of irrigation (ancient Egypt) from the slave mode of
production based upon the democracy of the city-state (ancient
Greece), the ancient Third World from the ancient First World.

The plagues of the Old Testament took place in the 13th  century
B.C.E.  They are the pestilences described in the Book of Exodus.
But what is this book?  It was composed at least three hundred years
afterwards, during the reign of Solomon.  It summarizes cultic
recitation, song, and chronicle: or, the official myths of an ancient
state, and must therefore be treated accordingly.

Zora Neale Hurston speaks of them as pan-African stories.  The
pestilences are exercises of the magical machismo of Moses, a man
with a stick, a rod of power, a serpent god who leads slaves to
freedom.  He must fight the Egyptian oppressor and the Egyptian
gods.  The victory over Pharaoh is a victory of superior magic.

Moses throws down his stick, and it becomes a serpent.  He dips it
in the waters of the Nile, and the waters turn to blood.  He stretches
his staff over the streams, and frogs fall all over, even into ovens
and kneading troughs.  He strikes the dust on the ground, and
maggots spring up everywhere on man and beast.

Flies, hailstorms, locusts, eclipses, pestilences, boils: Moses and
his stick bring all of them, and Pharaoh's magicians are stumped at
every turn.  Thus does Yahweh defeat the frog goddess, the sun
god, and the cattle deities.

Such serpent-and-stick power is a living power in Haiti and in
Dahomey as Zora Neale Hurston discovered.  How did Moses, the
leader of slaves and outlaws (for these are the Egyptian meanings of
the word "Hebrew") obtain his magic?  He learned it from
Pharaoh's stable boy, Mentu.  Moses says to him, "I love you
because you know all about the beginnings of things and you tell me
about them.  You tell me such nice lizard talk."

But Mentu did not give his knowledge for nothing.  Moses brought
him scraps from Pharaoh's kitchens.  "Roast pork at Pharaoh's table
meant boiled hog head for the help."  With his new pupil Mentu
could say, "I am eating further back on the hog now."

The class relations of magic-knowledge are made clear.  It is
concocted in kitchens and stables, exchanged for a price, and only
then comes the familiar, ambiguous story of rebellion, massacre,
and new kingdom.  "'No more toting sand and mixing mortar!  No
more taking rocks and building things for Pharaoh!  No more
whipping and bloody backs!  No more slaving from can't see in the
morning to can't see at night!  Free!  Free!  So free till I'm foolish.'
They just sat with centuries in their eyes and cried."

Certainly, this is a version that only is possible after the liberation of
the Afro-American, the historic person who straddles Christianity,
Judaism, and Voodoo.  The reading of the Egyptian pestilences
supplied as a result of that experience is the opposite of Luther and
Calvin, the gods of capitalism, whose Gospel was really "Work or
be Hanged."

2. "WHAT THEY HAD FORMERLY DONE IN A CORNER ..."
"ANCIENT GREECE

Thucydides.  Let us call him "Thuc."  He belonged to the "glory that
was Greece," and no wonder for he came from an aristocratic
family.  He was the manager of a gold mine on the frontier of the
Athenian empire.  He was a failed general and an exile of twenty
years.  We're supposed to study his book, THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR
as part of "western civilization."  OK.  Let's have a look.

He praised maritime imperialism.  He recounted the Athenian bid for
Mediterranean hegemony.  He lived in the transition to commodity
production, and to the money-form of human creation.  It is the
transition from piracy to commerce (smile).

In methodology his book is no less revolutionary, as it departs from
the magic of Moses.  It is influenced by the sophist theories of
disease propounded by Hippocrates: there is the observation of
symptoms, the chronicling of the course, the identification of the
crisis, and the analysis of causes.

The idea that Olson's idea was that you stop and breathe after each
line is a little bricky. But you can or could see the lines if you
heard him. I remember in 1963, "Maximus of Dogtown II" had not been
in print, but Olson read it in Vancouver a couple times. Dan McLeod
taped him, and then a month later sent a transcription of the tape to
Olson, and it turned out that the transcription agreed with Olson's
manuscript except for 3 times, which is pretty good for such a long
poem!

    This has happened again---what I hoped would be at least an INTERESTING
    debate (or something) about "women and tech" has just turned once again

    what may perhaps be an historical "accident"--that the increased number of
    women in the work-force or service industry (a phenomenon often attributed
    to "women's lib") happens to occur just as technology (computers, etc)
    is accelerating---thus, there's a cause effect relation, right?
    Sure, at least Haraway doesn't argue an "essentialist feminist" position
    and in this sense may seem to open up all kinds of possibilities---
    BUT she does seem to erase class issues, issues of access, and posits
    some vague FUTOPIA that doesn't give a fuck about ecologic depletion

Well, if we're going to get into it, Cris S, don't be essentialist in
your reading of comments from women.  I for one have never recommended
Haraway -- you'll note the items I recommended were studies of the impact
of specific information technologies historiclly on women, and vice
versa.  For where I stand on the question of cultural critiques of the
impact of technology on society (and vice versa, again), see a review of
Mark Poster's MODE OF INFORMATION in the JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION a
couple of years ago.  And of course I should not be guilty of
over-generalizing either.  While Paul Virilio, for example, reads as
quite abstract and metaphorical, in fact his insights into the nature of
war are extremely useful in its analysis and in, again, impacts of the
development of new information technologies on the theory and practice of
war.

_scientific american_ had a recent article (june/95) entitled "from
complexity to perpelexity." it included some wide-ranging definitions of
complexity. in this century, various scientists have thought they had
found a theory that explained almost everything (but more than science

Thanks to Herb Levy for making me think about why I loved Albert
Ayler and thought Hole was a void. Maybe it is because when I first
heard the Aylers I thought, gee, I havent heard this before and it
makes me clear away the sludge of what a lot of jazz had got into
during a long time of people trying other people's riffs. But when I
heard Hole on , I think, Saturday Night Ugh, it seemed that I was
hearing some people doing what I had heard other people doing. I
remember hearing Grandmaster Flash for the first time, and sitting up
as if I had a bullet against my eyebrow, but now I sit in a hotel
room in Helsinki and watch a Finnish rap group step up and down with
baseball hats on backward and chanted couplets and think why bother.
It seems to me that when I am turned on by something in pop music,
what I am hearing is something different from its surround but
shining with something back there in the what, tradition. That's why
I do like, say, ZZ Top.

   Thank you Sandra and Maria for your responses--Though the tone of my

   was a "mindless essentialism" going on--I too find the meandering inter-

   by women of how men do science"(damon) and "the impact of specific
   information technologies historically on women" and away from the more
   depoliticized illusion of mere "writing about technology" and though
   my interests tend to be more "class" oriented (and find 'technology'
   if not a false issue at least a "vehicle" that has gotten too large
   for its tenor and thus often a huge mystifier of "social processes"
   ---which is not a critique i'd make of poetry--even if one retrospectively
   defines poets from Sir Thomas Wyatt to Emily Dickinson as "technology"
   as Fuller did), I am curious in both of your (and others') speculations
   about women and science, and what "the next phase" (if you will) would
   be, say, without the notion of CYBORG----Again, thanks. Chris

        I'd say this was extremely true that man are awarded the ability
to practice science, but women are only perceived to study the theory
enabling them to write about tech and science, but not contribute.  ( this
is a generalization)  It seems to me after talking to friends in MSC
programs that there is bias against the female ability to remain logical
at all times of the month.  Interesting theory, I'd like to see the stats
and the case study based on this observation.  I also wonder if there was
a similar study done on the male ability to retain ones senses when in
the presence of breast.

Subject:      breath rules

As long as it is clear that by "breath" Olson did not really mean
breathing, the inhalation and exhalation of air, there is no problem.
Some people, however, think that by breath he meant breath, and
imagine that his lines of poetry really have something to do with a
physical part of the poet. Actually his lines were a typographical
display on the page, which one is expected to "see."

Others are bothered by the fact that Olson simultaneously
insisted on the poem as a personal performance, and attacked the
effect of the printing press on poet, yet was much interested in
seeing his poems in print.

But to worry about things like this is to betray the foolish
consistency that Emerson told us is the hobgoblin of little minds,
and to ignore the "Do I contradict myself? Very well, I contradict
myself" of Whitman.

 Olson meant by breath the incontrovertible spirit of the poet. "But
 breath is man's special qualification as animal," he says. Even in
 praising the typewriter he saw a technical method for expressing the
 breath: "It is the advantage of the typewriter that, due to its
 rigidity and its space precisions, it can, for a poet, indicate
 exactly the breath, the pauses, the suspensions even of syllables,
 the juxtapositions even of parts of phrases, which he intends."
 Breath, like technique, is a way of asserting power:

        If I hammer, if I recall in, and keep calling in, the
        breath, the breathing as distinguished from the hearing, it
        is for cause, it is to insist upon the part that breath plays
        in verse which has not (due, I think, to the smothering
        power of the line by too set a concept of foot) has not been
        sufficiently observed or practiced, but which has to be if
        verse is to advance to its proper force and place in the
        day, now, and ahead. I take it that PROJECTIVE VERSE teaches,
        is, this lesson, that that verse will only do in which a poet
        manages to register both the acquisitions of his ear and the
        pressures of his breath.

Responses from quite a number of those who knew Olson and heard him
read make it clear that "breath" is really an inimitable transcendental
quality of the poetry and is a function of the immortal poetic soul.

Next question: Olson says that "breath is man's special qualification
as an animal." Did he allow women breath as well?

--not to get all pop-culture on y'all, but. . . I live next door to a
three-year old, and the other night I was baby-sitting, and he was
showing me his _Pocahontas_ (underlined as they are after the Disney
movie) figurines, and John Smith comes with a sword AND a compass;
Pocahontas is just/of course buxom, scantily clad, doe-eyed, and somehow

There is something here--perhaps Old/New World, but male/female, too, and
worth thinking about.
I'm not going to jump on the Disney-is evil bandwagon (was driving that

Oh please don't start me on this one. Usually I'm a big Disney fan due
only to the skill of the animation, the stories are so-so and I've never
recovered from the butchering of the original Little MErmaid story ( it's
not supposed to have a happy ending).  But Pocanhantus wins the big loser
award.  I can see how they tired to make a fair representation, but
hollywood politics of $$$$$$ won instead.  Their big mistake was choosing
a historical figure rather than opting for pure fiction.  And come on, is
MEl GIbson really that good of a voice actor,  I thought he graduated
from the 12 step facial expression school of acting, especially after
witnessing Hamlet.
        Anyway for a better recommendation I watched "MRs. Parker and the
Vicious Circle" last night and I'd give it the thumbs up.

I think that "Happy 4th of July, everyone. . ." is a little
ambitious. For some of us it should be "Happy 1st of July." Or 14th
of July.

Hey. Linz. Read thru the file of TISH. All the way thru the 60s ther
writers in TISH went on and on about the local as the most important
fact in Vancouver writing.
Then jump ahead to my essay of a decade later, I guess, in which I
explain the difference between local (B.C. consept) and regional
(Ont. concept.)

In-Reply-To:  <B2C13A501FE@fagan.uncg.edu> from "H. T. KIRBY-SMITH" at Jul 4,
              95 02:09:02 pm

Where did this strange, reductionist idea that Olson equated the
length of a line with the length of a breath come from anyway? What I
read is "the HEAD, by way of the EAR, to the SYLLABLE, the HEART, by
way of the BREATH, to the LINE".

I don't quite understand how this gets translated into "the length of
a breath should equal the length of a line".

It seems to me that what's at stake here is a fundamental prosodic
principle. Do we base our verse on verse forms abstracted
from speech and regularized (historically) in print, or do we root
them in the human voice and all of its breathy irregularities in which
we can hear, as Olson would have it, the passionate speech of the
heart. To finish the quote TH Kirby-Smith starts: "But breath is man's
special qualification as animal. Sound is a dimension he has extended.
Language is one of his proudest acts. And when a poet rests in these
as they are in himself (in his physiology, if you like, but the life
in him, for all that) then he, if he chooses to speak from these
roots, works in that area where nature has given him size, projective
size."

What seems clear to me from this is the push in poetry to get
back to language as spoken, as voice--not as a distinguishing
identity, manifestation of self, but as root of our relation to the
world. We're in Walter Ong country here, or Stanley Cavell country
when he criticizes Derrida's graphocentrism and argues for voice as
the mark of the human and the limit of the metaphysical. Because
language is breath, ontologically speaking. Or as Chaucer has it in
Olson's favorite poem of his: "Speech is nought but ayre ybroken."

Also, lest we foget, "Projective Verse" is a polemical piece. It was
written in response to specific repressive, dominant practices, and
it's concerns are with creating an opening for other work to get done.
It is not prescriptive in the same way that 18th century handbooks
were. Rather, it's meant as an attack on prescription, as an opening
up. (For a very interesting discussion on the differences between the
traditional prescriptive handbooks and the proclamations and
manifestoes of modern poets after 1795, check out Donald Wesling's
*The Chances of Rhyme*.)

There's also, I think, a whole unopened can of worms here that has to
do with the relation of poetry to this kind of expository prose. I
just read an essay by a guy named Lawrence Rainey that attacks HD and
judges her to be a "minor" poet partially because she only wrote
poetry and never engaged in the polemical battles that so occupied
many of her male companions. As if your poetry can only be interpreted
and validated in terms of these abstract arguments, rather than the
other way around.

Best,
Mike

NOw, now Chris Let's not get snarky.  I don't want to shatter everyone's
image of one big happy poetic circle.  I just like it when someone as
repsectable (not sure if that really fits) as George Bowering has had the
same observations as myself.  Funny how no one attacks him isn't it?

Not only is "Projective Verse" a polemical piece; it was written in a
flash; and I remember Olson saying he was surprised at its
canonization. Worse was the dumb response of (often unsympathetic)
academics, who started talking about "Projectivist" poets, and the
"breath-line"; a highly instructive article was written a few years
ago by a U. of T. woman who showed that Williams's lines are not oral
lines but something to read AGAINST the breath, as a tight music.

WAR'S  END?

GRIFFITH UNIVERSITY/JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY

QUEENSLAND STUDIES CENTRE ANNUAL CONFERENCE   8-9 JULY

August 1945 marked the end of the most harrowing and transforming
collective experience in the history of modern Australia.  How much of the
'old' Australia came to an end with the cessation of hostilities, and how
much continued as before? What different meanings did the war's end have
for different groups and institutions in Australian society?

The Queensland Studies Centre will be holding its annual two-day
conference, in association with the History Department of James Cook
University in Townsville on 8-9 July of this year.

The conference will be interdisciplinary in scope,  embracing military,
social and cultural history; politics and political economy; literary and
cultural studies. Papers exploring any of the following aspects of the
topic would be welcome:

* literature and the arts
* education and social policy
* Aboriginal and ethnic communities
* women's history
* military and social history
* politics and industrial relations
* journalism and the media

Venue:  Townsville, Queensland.

Date:   8-9 July, 1995.

re- write colonial history to include those people either marginalised or
subjugated by the colonial process. This two day symposium will explore a
different aspect of post-colonial discourse through the exploration of one
of the best known events in Australian colonial history. In 1836 the
'Stirling Castle' was wrecked off the Queensland coast and many of the crew
together with the Captain's wife, Eliza, were marooned on Fraser Island.
Events surrounding the rescue of the castaways, in particular Mrs. Fraser,
received international media attention. In the last 160 years the story of
Eliza Fraser has become the subject of popular myth, fiction, opera, art,
film and scholarly research in the areas of cultural studies, literature,
history, anthropology, archaeology, women's studies, and the visual arts.
(Post) Colonial Fictions will examine critically the Eliza Fraser saga by
bringing together, for the first time, an interdisciplinary team of
academics, authors, artists and members of the Fraser Island community.
Discussions will include feminist analyses of the incident, textual and
iconographic representations of Aboriginal people, and Eliza Fraser as a
creative inspiration for the arts.

Speakers on 19th century ethnography, visual arts, and Fraser Island
history include: Ian Mc Niven, Lynette Russell, Rod McNeil, Olga Miller,
Elaine Brown; on 20th century cultural studies and Batdjala representations
include: Kay Schaffer, Sue Kossew, Jim Davidson, Jude Adams and Fiona
Foley. We are hopeful that the symposium will include an exhibition of
Fiona Foley's works and a performance by University of Adelaide
Conservatorium of Music students of the theatre opera: "Eliza Fraser Sings"
(arranged by Peter Sculthorpe/libretto by Barbara Blackman).



The Centre for Australian Studies in Wales, University of Wales, Lampeter, is
hosting a conference next year entitled "Australian Studies and the Shrinking
Periphery: Surfing the Net for Australia." Organisers are calling for papers.


"In recent years the consolidation of Europe into the 15 states of the EU,
the integration of east and west within Europe, and the progressive turning
of Australia to its own Pacific backyard have furthered the impression of
periphery: one world's edge looking distantly at the other."

I am reminded of the original meaning of *inspire*--to be breathed into
by the muse. So much of Olson has to do with the visceral, and he was
let's face it a heavy breather (how could a guy as big as he not be?)
and his breaths when reading, as I recall, made the poem dramatic.

as for the visual: when we stop connecting poems to the flesh and blood
and breath and tempo, then maybe we're no longer talking about poems
but rather about painting-drawing-sculpture (paging Ms. Holzer) or
whatever but not poetry.

Really?  Are poems the only things that are poetry?  And is it even
possible, even given an emphasis on the visual, that poems *can* be
disconnected from flesh, blood, breath and tempo?  Or is there an
everpresent connection to these things that is merely reshaped by that
visuality?  Are painting, drawing and sculpture not connected to flesh and
blood, breath and tempo?  This paragraph makes me think of a lot of
questions (which probably should have remained unsaid).  Please elaborate, Burt.

Thanks,
Steve

I'm teaching an advanced poetry workshop in the fall & wld welcome any

_Norton Postmodern_, _In the American Tree_, _o blek 12_, & maybe _Chain 2_
or _Disembodied Poetics_. Curious if people have found the Messerli book
"better" in the classroom, but it lacks the critical material which I think
wld be useful. Thanks.

I really dislike it when people start proselytizing on what's poetry and
what's not poetry, what's music and what's not music, what's book art and
what's not book art, etc. Can't you just say you don't like something,
without trying to cast it out of the pool? By these standards the work of
William Blake is, for the most part, not poetry at all. Do you want to cast
him out, too? Shall we begin making lists of artists whose work doesn't fit
in?

I've enjoyed these lists, which in many cases sent me back to my own
shelves - a process which throws up Feynmann (fine drummer, yes?),
Chatwin's Songlines and Julian of Norwich has to be worth continuing.
In my case the bedside/chairside/deskside/briefcase distinction doesn't
work, because the bedside books tend to move to the breakfast table, the
breakfast books come to work and so on - i.e. they all move. Which is
what a good book should do... Here goes:
1. Active in Airtime 4 : latest ed, of Essex University based magazine
edited by John Muckle & Ralph Hawkins.
2. Robin Blaser: The Holy Forest.
3. Ulla Dydo's Stein Reader. I needed this book years ago.
4. Ian Hamilton Finlay: Brount (Peninsula, 1995). I think this is the
only bilingual English/Dutch publication I have.
        "             : Ein Projekt fur das Bankhaus Schroder Munchmeyer
Hengst & Co (Wild Hawthorn, 1995).
5. F.C.Happold: Mysticism (this penguin anthology came off the shelf when
Julian was mentioned and I began a revisiting tour of the English Mystics).
6. Eric Mottram: Selected Poems (North & South).
        "      : Blood on the Nash Ambassador (Hutchinson).
7. Michael Palmer: At Passages (Haven't got beyond the lovely Ben Watkins
cover yet).
8. Terry Pratchett: Reaper Man (Arrgh! go back three spaces! this isn't
the kind of book serious people are supposed to like!)(But I do - apart
from anything else I like the Orang-utan Librarian, who gets paid
peanuts...).
9. Micheal Tippett: Those 20th Century Blues.
10. Gilbert White's Journals v.III, ed. Mabey, found on a remainder stall.

Tom Beard writes that he's moved by G.Hill, and that he hopes there's
room for that: me too: it's always room for a multiplicity of voices that
I'm interested in. But, in our over-crowded island, it's the Hill/Heaney/
Hughes/Harrison axis (more strictly, their critical supporters) which
endangers the wide view, and becomes - willingly or otherwise - a part of
the dominant culture. The other elements of poetry in the British Isles -
and there are many - often get squeezed into the margins and neglected in
one way or another. I'm sure this isn't news to anyone. G.Hill in his
early days did indeed produce some moving poetry - but he's been taken up
by the critical formalists and used as a stick with which to beat other
ways of writing. I'd like to believe he was an unwilling victim in this,
but nothing he's said or done could support such a reading.

I'm afraid on the whole mainstream British poetry audiences like their
poets GLUM, and the 4-H gang certainly give 'em that. Years ago I went to an
RSThomas reading where he berated his listeners solidly for fortyfive
minutes, miserable sinners, clods of earth and so on, and blow me,
everyone came out saying how wonderful it was! Against that, it's
certainly the non-dominant poetries which need the attention, the room.

--just to add to this, charles is right on the mark! what's insightful
abt his statement is the underlying apprehension of _interdisciplinarity_
in art, scholarship and reseach, the whole thing. and in the final
analysis, what charles' comment reminds me of is the crucial relation
between interdisciplinarity and the real cutting edge of art.  --and that's

I don't think Charles A. was off base at all. In o blek 12 I used a line,
which I can't remember right now whether it was appropriated-- "What is
poetic is necessarily defined by what it is not."

I think the question re Olson needs to be framed in terms of --
A) did he consider his theories contingent?
& B) did he need to?
On 7/2 George Bowering cited an instance in which transcription from a
reading of an unpublished Olson poem led to surprisingly correct lineation.

Dear Rod Smith:

You're absolutely right. Poems can be written any way the writer wants
to write them. My point was simply that in all the discussions of
breath in Olson's work that I'm aware of (and specifically in the
essay "Projective Verse,") I can find no proposal that the
length of a line should equal the length of a breath. The discussion
of breath and its relation to the line is much more complex than that.

But this is not to say that you can't write poems that way if you want.

Best,
Mike

I had to go to lunch with Geoffrey Hill once, and all he did was sit
there looking glum. Not even manic. Just glum. So I read some of his
poems. Then I felt glum.

Damn, Mike, I cant remember the name of the woman who wrote it, but
it was really persuasive to me. It might have been a thesis at U. of
Toronto, say 7 years ago or so. She said that WCW sets up these (she
is mainly talking about the poems that look like, say, the poems in
CEP, ) poems that look as if they have regular short-line quatrains,
but read with different enjambments etc than the visual; says that
WCW was setting up the regular-looking and then forcing you to read
it differently, adding a complexity you might now expect. If I run
across her name I will send it along. There's a CHANCE that she's now
the woman teaching Williams-HD at Queen's, but that is a wild and
tenuous guess, sort of the way I was at my visual field test
examination at the eye care clinic this morning.

Yeah, the late great crackpot anaimateur Fred Hill a few years ago
entered me in a poetry slam in Toronto under a silly fake name and I
read some poetry I wrote while the other contenders were reading, and
I won. I got a ridiculous but beautiful sweatshirt, and gave it to
the second-place finisher, saying that his stuff was way better. That
was a frisson of some sort.

Steve,

Historically speaking, I'd say that my definition of poetry stands
(not unlike in the way that my metaphor, "stands"--actually, technically
it's a catachresis in the original sense of the word--is indeed
metaphoric because it derives from the flesh and blood human who
stands; but I am wandering off . . .).  Are we perhaps needing
to make a distinction between *poetry* and *poetic*?

In any case, visual art (versus verbal or just plain musical "art") is
spatially oriented, whereas poetry and music are temporally oriented
(notwithstanding some mixed/blurred avant-garde art and/or performance
art), which means that experiencing one or the other will be essentially
different, I think. But okay, let's divorce verse from the bard. There
has been plenty of concrete and other kinds of poetry.  But then I
gotta compare that stuff with the thrill of hearing (better yet hearing and
seeing) Olson read, and not just cause he was star either.  And
Olson subscribed at times in writing to the belief that poetry and
the human body were connected. Didn't he?

greetings,

been reading Edmond Jabes' *The Book of Questions* lately, picking up
what's available in the library, as oppose to working from vol.1 thru
to vol.7
am working on a response piece to my reading and am so stuck on a
certain concept that i cant seem to place, but i think is "real". the
reading experience is like reading the commentaries (and this is
where i get confused) on the Talmud, or the Cabala. was this done by
Rabbis or family members, marginal notes they would make, questions
and such on the text they are reading. is this sort of commentary
done? and is it done stricktly by Rabbis or is a family/generational
practice? i'm certain my ideas are coming from some where, and i dont
think it was derrida's piece on jabes. i can only think about
A.M.Klein, and maybe reading related to him.

in any case i'm slightly stuck and looking for a gentle shove or
pull. i think there is a article in *The Sin of the Book* (Gould,
ed.) that relates to what i'm vaguely trying to pin down, but i wont
have access to that book for a few weeks, and my curiosity can't
wait.

in anticipation,

graham

I do like _The Art of Practice_ but the _o blek_ has the advantage of the
statements. & actually I'm thinking interviews cld be good. Maybe the Hoover,
o blek 12, _The Talsiman Interviews_, &/or the Berrigan interviews O Books
did. I mean it seems that they usually come in w/ enthusiasm & the trick is
not to squelch that. Berrigan is great that way, his dedication to the art, I
think, is contagious.

it's an old suggestion, but maybe teach from current little magazines
rather than anthologies?  many in AoP or oblek are pretty actively
publishing; talisman would certainly be a prime candidate fr poetry
& criticism--and you could get a dozen+ chaps (frm leave, texture,
generator, potes & poets, standing stones, &&&....).  nothing to
help enthusiasm than to have hold of something fresh & new & not-
yet-known.  plus the chance to keep a press or two in the black
(or less in the red).  PLUS, the chance to point to a coupla less-
than-perfect poems, give a flavor of what can go wrong in a poem,
as well as what's right

Burt, concerning --
"Cast Blake out?! Of what?  No, no. Please, no lists. Sorry, I just thought
that I was answering someone's query.  To hell with breathing!"

not to hell with it -- I like breathing, too

As for going to definitions of poetry, its etymology, "to stand," etc., it
seems to me that we want it both ways, want words to mean something
eternally, to contain their origins, but also to allow them to evolve, to
continue to develop and change their meanings.

This morning I'm not certain whether I'm more excited by Olson's human
breath, Mac Low's aleatoric generations (which may or may not involve
breathing as a compositional idea), bp Nichol's visual  compositions, or
something else. I love the quiet of Bev Dahlen's work, where one feels (in
much of A Reading, at least) one is not so much hearing speech, as
hearing/reading "thought taking shape."

But the idea of something being poetry because of feeling the blood move --
I don't know. Emily Dickinson said she knew something was poetry if it took
her head off. I love Dickinson & Olson, but I don't know if I want to allow
that I have to either have the blood boiling or be lobotomized before I see
something as poetry.

But I do like the passion with which you speak for Olson's ability to move
one who reads or hears him.

    Dear Rod--I think the suggestion that you teach your students stuff
    from contemporary magazines (suggested by who---someone from ohio?
    lbd or byrum, i forget) is good--maybe AERIEL----
    but I tend to find all anthologies pretty limiting and have taken to
    bootlegging (though that, too, involves bootlicking)--last year
    I used the sun and moon anthology--The Creeley section is eminantly
    teachable---especially the one about the tree and the one about
    the airplane (the latter can be usefully juxtaposed with the talking
    heads song "the big country")---but this time I taught an INTRODUCTION
    TO LITERATURE CLASS and wanted a better sense of new york school stuff
    than Messerli can do, but at the same time wanted older people like
    Stevens and Stein and Riding and NON-AMERICANS (oh horrors, horrors!)
    like Gig Ryan (from magazine--actually Hoover's mag.) and many Germans
    in translation....
    Of course Rod, you should teach my CUSPS poems too. chris

      "if only I weren't feeling sentimental, but how else can you get
       passionate, and I at least know that's my devoir."(74)
     So--Rod, Joe Ross's new work seems definitely more O'Hara than Ashes
     (but I do agree with you definitgely more Ashes "compared to his other

Maybe she meant something as straightforward as her poems:
something is poetry when it makes you think/see/feel differently. It
suprises.

Must a poem surprise? And what does that have to do with "newness"? Every
breath is new, even if the air isn't fresh.

A thought on poetry=ink on a page/is a drawing?: Draw in a breath.

It shouldn't be too hard to find the answer to your question of whether it was
rabbis or generations of male family members --ask your resident talmudist, if
you have a judaic studies program or dept.  also, check out daniel boyarin's
work if you haven't done so already --he's a talmudic scholar and has a
post-sstructuralist, emancipatonist approach, thoug lately he's been into
lacanian psychoanalysis.  have fun w/ jabes, he's a dreamboat though i admit i
float in and out of relating to his work.  the stuff on being jewish, and on the
book, is absolutely yummy --the stuff on death...well, maybe it's too deep for
me.--md

Since we're talking Talmud, everybody should check out the recently
published Nine Talmudic Readings, by Emmanuel Levinas--I'm sure this has
everything to do with Jabes, but I haven't the slightest idea how to go
about saying just what that is.  I am, though, sure it's bigger than the
fact that Derrida writes essays on both in Wrtg and Diff.

I don't usually talk about this, but many years ago Michael Davidson and I did
underwater readings as part of a musical performance & event by Michel
Redolfi.  We performed in the swimming pool of Ginger Rogers' former bungalow
in Bird Rock (La Jolla), where Michael was then living.  There was a mask-like
device that gave us a minute -- maybe half a minute -- before it filled with
water.  Redolfi recorded it for playback within a longer underwater piece
in the olympic swimming pool at UCSD.  Michael's part was to read actual
written poetry set down with special waterproof ink, while I decided to go
with chanted translations of songs from (Seneca) Shaking the Pumpkin.  The
breathing part of it -- a constant struggle -- had nothing to do with
projective verse.  I think I ended up sounding like a beached whale, but I
actually looked pretty trim in the wet suit -- of which there are still some
photographs.

The naive breath notion -- of breath & line coinciding in length -- is of
course Ginsberg rather than Olson.  Allen used to be pretty boastful about
how long he could hold his breath & all of that.  (I don't mean "naive"
pejoratively, by the way -- just straightforward in the way that some of the
conversation about this has gone.  Allen is most eloquent & moving with
regard to this in the Notes for Howl.  But I don't think he ever tried it
under water.

All best

Loss,

Please list Poetry New York: A Journal of Poetry and Translation, which
comes out yearly, and which is not seeking subscriptions but encourages
people to buy it in bookstores. It is eclectic. It is archived at
SUNY Buffalo, Poets House, NYC Research Library, Brown U. and other
places. It is distributed by DeBoer. I am the Senior Editor. Tod
Thilleman is the Editor.Emmy Hunter is the Associate Editor.
We've just put the upcoming issue to bed (it will be out in late fall
at the earliest), but otherwise we welcome submissions along with
contributor's note of no more than, say, four poems and/or translations
of poems (and send in original language too if possible); but
we do NOT welcome submissions from JUne-August. Best time to send is early
spring.  I say that the magazine is eclectic but it does lean toward
the experimental (though one can find traditional verse in it too).

Any more questions can be directed to me at my email address or to
PNY, P.O. Box 3184, Church Street Station, NYC 10008.

Hmm...  By any chance, this piece wasn't called "til human voices reach us,
or we drown...," was it?  I  love the idea of stuff like this--a sort of
spectacular (in the SI sense?)  hyper-literalist performative action poem.
The possibilities are endless. An insomniac High-church prelate reading
Keats' Bright Star while out on a tethered space-walk: "And Watching,
with eternal lids apart,/ Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,/
The moving waters at their priestlike task...,"  George Burns (cigar
intact) lashed to the mast of a Carnival Cruise Line ship, reading
Sailing To Byzantium as it (the ship, with an Luau in full swing on the
Lido deck)  passes through the Hellespont, a Greek chorus of Arkansas
poultry processing  workers chanting Williams's Red Wheelbarrow as an endless
line of all-organic, range-fed gamehens whizz by on a conveyor belt.

Burt:

Sure, poetry is connected with the human body, as is dance ("poetry in
motion"), which, if I'm not mistaken, is very spatially-oriented, though it
unfolds in time as well.

I guess my questions weren't directed so much at the historical standing of
your definition, but at how sturdy its ontological "legs" are.  This
dichotomy between spatiality and temporality may have worked for Lessing in
1775 in the "Laocoon", but wasn't Einstein's contribution to point out that
trying to isolate space and time from each other is an illusion, however
historically stable an illusion it may be, and however different the
experience of different media with their differing locations within
spacetime?  When you say "(better yet, hearing and seeing) Olson read",
doesn't that indicate that there's something that's really important that's
visual about poetry even when it's not on the page?  To put it on the page
may be to move it closer to painting, etc., but I don't think it moves it
outside the realm of poetry, nor do I think its connection with the body
withers.  It simply takes a different approach to the body by creating a
simulacrum of a body, by embodying itself as writing, but with inspiration
still breathed into it, just like if there were a bard.

To belabor the point even further (sorry!)  Heidegger asserts that "all the
arts are essentially poetry" because they're all kinds of language.  Poetry
is the original art because it most "preserves the essential nature of
language."  (Origin of the Work of Art)

If it's just a matter of taste--concrete poetry vs. seeing and hearing a
poet speak--that's one thing, but to define "poetry" around such a choice
and, by implication, exclude concrete poetry, Apollinaire, Cummings, Blake
(as someone pointed out--Michael Broughton?), a possible ESL poetry, etc.,
etc., seems to me a bit rash.

If it was just an attempt to be provocative--good work!  I took the bait! :-)

Best to you and all,
Steve

A poem is a surprise, and a breath is sometimes suspended, sometimes heavy,
sometimes not taken, sometimes even visual or audible. So is ink on a page.

As I recall, Jim Rosenberg, whom I believe is on this list, had a show
at a gallery in SF back in the 1970s (and reasonably early in that
decade as well) which include a series of word imprinted on clear
plastic cards that were to be thrown into a swimming pool, so that
readers would swim from word to word, a poem in constant drift.

The same show had an "oscilloscope" (I believe that was the machine)
printout of a record of Pound reading one of his Cantos, a registration
of the voice and breath therein.

It was a pretty great show and has returned to my mind a thousand times
since I saw it.

Well, because of his cerebral palsey and related physical problems
(some of which were helped considerably by some surgery that he had in
his 30s), he was publishing his early books before he learned to speak.
His parents did not think that he even "had" language before he learned
to use a typewriter in his late teens.

The line in his work is an extraordinary physical act, given his
ability to use three fingers on one hand and a basic grasping motion
with the other. When I first read his poems on the page in the mid-60s,
I "heard" that voice too and it was not until I tried calling him on
the phone that I first realized exactly how much of a projection that
was. Eigner may in fact have been drawn to Olsonian poetics precisely
because it was there that he could in fact "speak."

Once his parents got to be too old to care for him and he first moved
to California, he was set up in a group home in North Berkeley where
his brother bought him a desk that had the drawers on the wrong side
(Larry can only reach to the right), so for him to reach a piece of
paper to get (with some difficulty) into the typewriter meant spinning
the wheelchair 360 degrees.

Those "light, airy" poems are in fact the complex choreography of one
whose total physical vocabulary is in use in the composition of the
poem.

I didn't mean to be restrictive. If you like it, good. If you want to call
it art, all well and good (I guess).  But--setting Derrida's supplement aside--
I can't help going back to Ong and to the fact of time-scansion-musical
accompaniment-sceop who was historian before writing takes hold (okay,
in China this maybe doen't and didn't hold).  But regarding E's 4th
dimension and all, doesn't art create illusions?

107 - 14th Street / Buffalo, New York 14213
edited by Jena Osman and Juliana Spahr
appears annually
$7.95
6x9, 288 pages
issn: 1076-0520
isbn: 0-922668-12-4
publication date: October 1, 1994

This first issue explores its editor's apprehension about editing. It
attempts to create a dialogic space through its investigation of the
(im)possibility of an unmediated reception and the (im)possibility of
detaching a writing from its presentational/ideological form.

Chain 1 begins with a forum on how and why journals are created and in
what ways questions of gender have informed those decisions. As such
it investigates the implications behind making taste public and the
manner in which taste presents itself in the public sphere. This
section includes an interview between Dodie Bellamy (of Mirage) and
Andrea Juno (of Research) on Angry Women and "sex positive" editing
practices; Dubravka Djuric (of Mental Space) on editing in communist
and post- communist societies; Heather Findlay (of On Our Backs) on
collaborative editing; Susan Gevirtz (of HOW(ever)) reading editing as
medical diagnosis; Holly Laird (of Tulsa Studies in Women's Litera
ture) on the difficulties and rewards of editing feminist journals in
the academy as well as pieces from a number of small press and
feminist editors.

Instead of a collection that claims over and over the ability of the
editor to know and define, Chain is a journal that claims instead
"this made itself and here is what it's made of; it is just part of
what continues." In order to facilitate a journal that could make
itself, Chain used the model of the chain letter. A number of writers
from the U.S., Canada, and England were asked to send a piece of
writing to another writer. These writers responded by writing a poem
and then send ing both poems onto a third participant, and so
forth. This section includes work by Abigail Child, Gail Scott, Norma
Cole, Sianne Ngai, Kate Rushin, Fiona Templeton and others.

Chain/2: Documentary
Edited by Jena Osman and Juliana Spahr
107 - 14th St./Buffalo, NY  14213
$10 for one issue (6"x9", 250 pp.)
Make checks payable to UB Foundation.

The second issue of Chain questions the supposed neutrality/objectivity of
documentary forms. The concerns of this issue are: in what ways does the
topical world filter through language? how do creative forms actually capture
an event, a person, a place? The work included highlights the way we use
language/image to cut up our experiential encounters so as to (re)see them.

MAGAZINES _YOU_ READ:

I wanted to also ask people to post (or send to me) names of magazines
they read, think are important, should really be mentioned!  (I
thought to compile this list for the EPC as an added resource - and to
help fill in the blanks where entries do not exist.) Maybe a word or
two, if you feel like it, about why the magazine is one you read would
also be useful.

Hello all,

Followed the recent discussion of the Ern Malley Affair with some
interest. Can anyone out there direct me to other examples  of literary
hoaxes (besides the famous ones like Chatterton & the Ossian poet),
particularily in the 20th century?

Most appreciative,

Subject:      Offsets to the Frame

The discussion of WCW's rhythm working as offsets to the frame of the graphical
line on the page interests me very much.  I've made similar observations with
respect to some of Creeley's poems.  The details can get quite lengthy, but:
I use a concept of "measure", which is not quite the same thing as the
classical concept of "foot"; many of Creeley's lines are two measures, with
the natural "grammatical framing" going from one mid-line measure boundary
to the next mid-line measure boundary.

I posted a quite lengthy article that deals with this and many other things
under the subject "Notes Toward a Non-linear Prosody of Space" to ht_lit some
moons back; it is available on the web at

http://www.well.com/user/jer/nonlin_prosody.html

If there is interest I can repost it here; it's about 345 lines long.

Folks--

I'm happy to post the "Poetics Reading List June 1995." I'm pleased that so
many people seem to think this to be a good idea. I'd like for it to be a
monthly/bimonthly feature on this list and I'm willing to do the gathering
& organization of it. All I need is your cooperation. Feel free to post
what you are currently reading or if it seems more appropriate, email me
backchannel at: kgolds@panix.com or kennyg@wfmu.org. I'll continue as long
as there is interest. I hope you won't mind if every once in a while I post
a reminder message to the group.

This month there seemed to be a couple of threads converging on recommended
reading. I've thrown 'em all in together as they all look like good reading
to me.

Peace,
Kenny G

P.S.--March's reading list is available through me. If you want a copy
email me or if there is enough interest, I'll re-post it.

work-related). The latter books are either in transition to home or are
books I read during lunch breaks.

From: Chris Scheil <cschei1@GRFN.ORG>
Subject: Re: Reading lists

Well, I've got a few books of interest I've been looking at lately--hope
nobody minds if I chime in here...


1. Raising Holy Hell (Bruce Olds) A fictionalized life ofJohn Brown, due
out in September. Amazing book--very powerful, though it bogs down in the
last fifty or so pages, after Lee and JEB Stuart crash Brown's party at
Harpers Ferry. This is by far the best review copy to cross my desk this
year...

2. Manuscript Found in Saragossa (Jan Potocki) This was mentioned in
Perec's bk (A Void) & just came out in an English translation.
Hallucinatory & dense--imagine a new Decameron co-written by Goya &
Hoffman, wardrobe by Edith Head, sets by Lautremont...

3. Exact Change Yearbook, At Passages, From the Other Side of the Century:
all part of my vacation Michael Palmer festival. Very interesting to hear
Palmer read his new Poems. I'd not imagined his voice sounding like it
does; the surprise I felt was akin to the first time I heard Creeley or
Williams read--how hearing the poets voicing radically changes the way one
reads the written work--the way theauthors diction & intonation get somehow
ingrained in yourhead & you find yourself internalizing their vocalization.
A bit disturbing, that--almost as if the very act of listening to a
recording imposes some kind of individualized canonic reading, underming
whatever tactical method of poetic speech you've brought to the written
text...

4. Passing Duration, Four Lectures: I've always gotten the sensethat
Rodefer's work is somehow out there pacing the Langpo boundaries (maybe
event horizon is a better term...). Ghosts of events in those sentences,
gesturing toward some alien narrative in hopes of arriving at
atmosphere--The same thing I feel reading Coolidge sometimes. Is there
anything available since Passing Duration that I might have missed?

Subject: Bedside reading

This is Kevin Killian. I'm glad to see this feature return, as I too read
Vanity Fair regularly tho' the book list is not my favorite. The true crime
articles are.

Here is what I've just picked up from around my bed:

"Vel" by Peter Inman-fantastic. Four stars to you, P. Inman. We printed one
of these poems in"Mirage #4/Period[ical]" but now I see, it was not the
best one after all, there are many, many just as good or better!

"Castle King Four," by Jim Reagan, who sent me this book, haven't read it
yet, don't know why he sent it. He said it was a peace offering. I don't
know who he is! Seems to be a novel that pits Nazis against the OSS.

"Sliver," by Ira Levin. I read it about every six months. Dodie wrote a
paper about it once, for Todd Baron and Carolyn Kemp's zine "REMAP," on
"narration." "A zillion times better than the movie," she says. When is the
Ira Levin Conference happening?

Claude Royet-Journoud, "A Descriptive Method," tr. Keith Waldrop-it's
small, I should have finished this last week. Didn't. Just found it.

"Berlin Diptychon" by John Yau & Bill Barrette. I'm copying one of the
poems here, "The Night Beast is Best," for my new poem, which will have a
better title. This book is very luxe, glossy, heavy ink smell, has Berlin
written all over me.

"Tender Agencies," by Dennis Denisoff. Why this book isn't a best seller
I'll never know. Dennis D. is so smart & so accessible. He is a former
member of the Kootenay School and from what I understand will be working at
Princeton this fall. Yay Dennis.

"Abusing the Telephone," by Dennis Barone. We had Dennis B. read at Small
Press Traffic where he read some of this. We were screaming, kind of. I
mean it was sedate in a way. This is a very fiction collective kind of
book, tho published by Drogue. Dennis, any one of these tales could have
been a novel, I say, expand, don't contract, be expansive like Whitman.

2 new books by Alice Notley. Haven't opened it yet.

Thom Gunn, "The Man with Night Sweats." Thom Gunn is a local hero & a swell
guy. This book is his best one yet.

"Arshile #4" ed. Mark Salerno. Arshile #4 features an interview with
Gilbert Sorrentino. I always wondered why I had never met GS since he works
at Stanford and I'm in San Francisco. Now I find that "the Bay Area is so
utterly antithetical to me that I find myself, at all times, struggling
against its cuteness, its apathy, its general air of paralysis, its
relentless small-townishness, so that it's hard to imagine being 'mellowed
out' in the throes of battle. I don't quite know what it is about the
place, but the entire Bay Area, with the source of infection being, of
course, that citadel of provincialism, San Francisco, has the air of an
amateur stage production set in sinister natural surroundings." What a
jerk. How about that "source of infection" metaphor Mr. Sorrentino? Are we
afraid of the AIDS virus at Stanford University? Anyhow Arshile #4 has this
wonderful piece in it by Yoko Ono and as usual a marvelous cover, this time
by Jasper Johns.

Bruce Andrews, "Ex Why Zee," collected, I don't know, work for the
"theater"? Black and white drawing on the front, "pathetic masculinity" as
the art forum says. "Abject art" my favorite. All these little men running
around doing disgusting things, . . . four stars for the cover alone,
belongs in the Whitney.

"Apex of the M" #3. Read it from cover to cover searching for the
explanation from the editors, why on earth they went ahead last time and
printed that work by King Homophobe Ed Dorn! No explanation, still. One
editor told me that if they explained every editorial policy they made it
would be too long a magazine. Fine. Just wanted to put in my 2 cents on
this subject. Again.

"Everything as Expected," by James Herndon. This book, from the 70's, is
the essential insider's guide to the collaboration between Jack Spicer &
Fran Herndon. Color plates. Seven of these collages were shown at recent
Blaser conference. Five stars.

"Tony & Susan," by Austin Wright. I think I got this mixed up with "Austin
and Mabel" but instead of being about the relatives of Emily Dickinson it
is some kind of literary horror novel. Check it out. I'm up to Chapter
Five.

"Esther: Her Murder Haunts a Small Town in Oklahoma." True crime book.
Esther is a schoolteacher, in her seventies I think, I think she was
murdered in her sleep by some former students, but she's just gone to bed
just now at the place I've put it down.

"Written in Blood," by Caroline Graham. She is my new favorite detective
writer. Okay, so the ends of her books are always stupid.

"Empire of Words: the Reign of the OED," by John Willensky. This guy
teaches at UBC and this book studies the use of citation in the different
editions of the OED to come to some conclusions about cultural studies.
Work it, girl.

Finally I've come to the floor. Okay and one last book I've just finished
from the library, "The Juror," by George Dawes Green. had to get this one
since it's the basis of the upcoming Demi Moore picture. The back jacket
says that Dawes Green is a poet and the author of "the acclaimed novel "The
Caveman's Valentine" and he looks about 12. Excellent! George Dawes Green
are you on this poetics list? Come on down!

I love these lists also. Although Kevin's has made mine feel inadequate. My
excuse is moving. I've been trying to refile but I've also pulled out all
these old books that I found while trying to alphabetize:

Mary Butts Imaginary Letters; Crystal Cabinet; Traverner Novels; (by the
way, any Butts fans out there, would love some info back channel about any
good criticism, I haven't found much at all good or bad, and info about the
Crowley-Butts connection and her opium addiction (?).

Don DeLillo, Libra

Keri Hulme, Bone People (which has been abandoned as unreadable)

Ben Friedlander (there is an image of a knot for the title) (this is
available from Meow Press); recommended

Rachel Tzvia Back, Litany (also Meow Press and recommended)

Prosodia / 5 (nice mix of writers, mainly west coast; put out by the
students of the New College of California Poetics Prog)

Bloo (good pieces by Dodie Bellamy and Kevin Killian and Pat Reed)

Lesli Scalapino, Defoe (I love this book and have become obsessed with it
in the same way that I became obsessed with Fanny Howe's Saving History
last year)

a large stack of fashion magazines where I have actually been spending most
of my reading time

I would like it if people on this list would just post a brief message
about something good they have read whenever they read it and how to get
it. I mean both stuff that is available at any Barnes and Noble and stuff
that comes in the mailbox. In more cases than not that usually motivates me
to obtain said item and in more cases than not I am glad that I did.

Hi all--here's what's threatening to fall on me and crush me in my sleep:

_How Things Work: Science For Young Americans_, a 1941 textbook with some
truly freaky illustrations.

_Earth and Sky Every Child Should Know_, similar, except w/a 1910 copyright.

Mark Twain, _The Innocents Abroad_.

Thich Nhat Hahn, _The Blooming of a Lotus_, a wonderful book of simple
meditations.

Levi-Strauss, _The Savage Mind_. Learned a new word ("moiety") from this
one. Means "half." Not a hapax--he uses it twice.

A stack of submissions to Antenym, the magazine I edit (#7 due out in
August, featuring [at least] George Albon, John Olson, Colleen Lookingbill,
Darlene Tate, J.R. Willems, John Taggart, Charles Borkhuis, Michael
Basinski, Brian Boury, Andrew Joron, Michael Price, Kristin Burkart, Sheila
E. Murphy, Carol Ciavonne, Larry Eigner, Mike Kettner, I.E. Skin, Jean Day,
and Bob Heman). Now if I can only figure out in what order to present them!


_Six By Seuss_. Of course.

And soon--
Buckminster Fuller, _I Seem To Be A Verb_. Soon as I can get my hands on a copy.

Okay--I'll chime in---
I'm reading these unpublished manuscripts---
I am extremely knocked out by Ben Friedlander's reading of Frank O'Hara AND
YOU BIG NAME PUBLISHERS OUT THERE ARE FOOLS NOT TO JUMP ON IT WHILE YOU
CAN----
This is the kind of "literary criticism" one does not see often-- Then I'm
reading THE FATE OF THE SELF (By Corngold--first time in paperback of a
1985 book---I'm reading this for possible "academic use" so i'm reluctant
to mention it here, as is my reading in Shakespeare criticism--Susan
Snyder, H.T. McCrary, etc. etc--- ) Also got the EXACT CHANGE BOOK---The
Stein piece (and Spahr's intro.) is great. Peter Gizzi's new manuscript has
a great poem to Mark McMorris in it...and I got the new Garret lansing
HEAVENLY TREE book...
I'm sure I'm leaving things out...I read "Marriage" by Marianne Moore the
other day---I often spend a whole night on one page! I read O'Hara's "To An
Actor Who Died" because it's original title was "To Laura Riding" and
"everybody" is telling me I should read Agamban very soon---
It would be interesting if we could talk more about why we're reading (or
what is happening why reading) than merely about WHAT--but perhaps that is
not a function of the list....chris

I "forget to mention" (or "censored") that I'm also reading a lot of
student papers in this summer class i'm teaching. A "reading literature"
course that is weighted towards poetry and the reading of "non-poetic"
texts "poetically"--I organized the course loosely around the theme of
"NOTHING" and have not used official anthologies so i could include Stevens
("Adagia"), Mayer (Sonnets and "the obfuscated poem") O'Hara, Cage, Stein,
Riding, Kafka, Beckett, Ellison, Baraka, Ferlinghetti, Dickinson,
Shakespeare, Dudley Randall, Blake in one class (also Brecht and
Rilke)---I've selfishly swept up my students in my summer reading--but I
"commit" to the list and so it's no more "free" in a way than had i gone
with a "conventional" commercial anthology---thank "god" for copy shops
that 'pirate" things--- Chris S.

I, too, really like the "bedside reading" feature of the list. Here are
some that are, actually, closer to the couch:

1) VOLCANO, by Garrett Hongo, in which he recounts his search for the Big
Island childhood he never had. An honest attempt, woefully written (he puts
Keats and Shelley in a cuisinart and pours the remains over fields of
lava).

2) THE WINGED SEED, Li-Young Lee. A memoir/prose poem about growing up in
Indonesia and rural Pennsylvania, as the son of a Chinese fundamentalist
Christian father. Interesting experiment, which most often works, except
when he addresses his beloved.

3) TURNING JAPANESE, David Mura. Yes, there's a theme here. Memoir of an
Asian-American poet from Minnesota who lived for a year in Japan;
interesting "identity" study. I like his prose better than his poetry,
which sounds more like, well, prose.

4) DICTEE, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha. Memoir in experimental pieces, which I
haven't yet finished. But there's a strong article on her by Shelley Wong
in _Feminist Measures_, edited by Lynn Keller and Cristane Miller
(Michigan)--good on the "problem" with Asian-American experimental writing
and identity politics.

5) Lots and lots of Gertrude Stein.

6) XENIA, by Arkadii Dragomoschenko. Wonderful meditative passages.

7) CANNIBAL, by Terese Svoboda. OK, so she's a friend of mine. I heard her
read sections of this book about her travels in the Sudan at our new Barnes
and Noble; they put her in the cookbook section.

8) Poems by Sudesh Mishra, a poet from Fiji who lives in Australia. Rather
Walcottesque in its metaphorical density; his claim is, however, that this
work IS experimental in his context.

I also confess to an over-fondness toward Nirvana's Unplugged cd, though
I'm perhaps too late for the rock lyric discussion of a while back. Great
rendering of a Leadbelly song.

Subject: Doom Patrols (Reading list)

As long as I'm giving out URLs, one of my summer reading books is not yet
in print and only available on-line, Steve Shaviro's "Doom Patrols." It can
be found at <http://dhalgren.english.washington.edu/~steve/doom.html>.


Based on the chapters I've read so far, I highly recommend it to anyone on
poetics list.

It's not, and not about, poetry, but it's the first prose book I've read in
a while that's given me the same buzz as the all-over, personal inner-mind
sprawl of many recent longpoems.

"Doom Patrols" is an autobiographical work of literary theory; a rich blend
of gender theory, electronic culture, comic books & films, true
confessions, (very) revisionist post-structuralist thought, rock & roll,
self-exposition, new (&old) abjectionists) and more. Chapter titles
include: David Cronenberg, Kathy Acker, Dean Martin, Daniel Paul Schreber,
Walt Disney, Cindy Sherman, et al.

You might for argument's sake teach some letterpress books from Toothpaste

_The Ern Malley Affair_ by Michael Heyward, Faber & Faber, (London, Boston)
284 pp., $12.95 US, $19.99 Canada

in paper and available through Barnes & Noble (they have several copies at
the Astor Place branch,) is notable for the clarity with which it deals
with the complexities of taste, literary identity, and experimental
writing. The book seems (from here) a subtle treatment of the literary
scene in Australia in the 40s, particularly of the self-regard of Max
Harris and the stance of his magazine, _Angry Penguins_, that so irritated
James McAuley and Harold Stewart, two poets in an OSS-sounding organization
called the Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs, that they
manufactured, with the aid of a collected Shakespeare, the Concise Oxford
Dictionary, a Dictionary of Quotations, and a US Army report on mosquito
control, Ern Malley and his poems. In an afternoon. Ahem. Anti-hegemony and
Edgar Allen (sic!) Poe take note:

Malley was born in an idle moment that afternoon in the spring of 1943.
After lunch McAuley and Stewart had the place to them- selves: there were
no urgent telegrams to deal with, no research jobs to finish on the double.
Here was their chance to do something they'd fantasized about, take _Angry
Penguins_ down a peg or two. Another issue was just out--they thought it
reached new heights of pretension. They set to work improvising Ern Malley,
their Primitive Penguin, writing his poems out on an army- issue, ruled
quarto pad, tearing each page off as they filled it.

Heyward is not _totally_ convinced of the merit of the poems, which are
collected in the book (as are Malley's Ernst-ish collages), but he does
cite defenders of the work including Judith Wright, John Tranter, John
Ashbery and Kenneth Koch. Some effects of the hoax were: to unbalance the
equation of value between a work of poetry and the name on it; to suggest,
very early on, the possibility that work generated by chance and mischief
(and with deliberate disregard for taste) can be taken for beautiful and
meaningful; and to turn public attention to poetry (albeit disastrously).

Hello poetics,
Suppose it may have been noted, but Joe Ross has poems in _Avec_ &
_Impercipient_ from something called "The Fuzzy Logic Series"-- he's
referred to them as "Ashberyan" and they do seem so. Particularly compared
to other of his work.
Re my own bed:
I'm taken at the moment by _Touch Monkeys: Nonsense Strategies for Reading
Twentieth-Century Poetry_ by Marnie Parsons. U.Toronto Press overpriced
hardcover. Interesting reading of Stein/Zukofsky/Language through Lewis
Carroll, Edward Lear, etc. using Kristeva to very good end. Though she gets
Cage wrong I think. But I would.
Also the new Hobsbawm _Age of Extremes_ very excellent.
Really wanted to like Deirdre Bair's _Anais Nin_ --more interested in Bair
than Nin, i.e. why did she choose to write about her following Beckett &
Beauvoir-- but it's fallen to the wayside.
Also I have many copies of _Aerial 8: Barrett Watten_ beside my bed which I
certainly recommend. $12.95 to Aerial/Edge, POBox 25642, WDC 20007. I'll be
posting soon a longer description of that as well as backlist info.
Lightning w/ logic: dogs bark at strangers. Not enough & too much? or Maybe
you had too much too fast. Can the Fuzzy be more than metaphorical? as
Chaos Theory was a hot metaphor in the arts a few years ago. Not to dismiss
description but I want to see it happen. I mean, The sun _is_ one foot
wide. How?

I enthusiastically recommend for a solid intro. Walter Ong's book Orality
and Literacy (re. alphabet as tech, etc.). I guess the alphabet is
inevitably to be seen as a technology since it comes with writing. You
might want to look at Hand's End by David Rothenberg who builds on
Heidegger; R argues that language is a technology (I'm only half convinced
and doubt I'll go the other half but who knows?).

Also I recommend Evelyn Fox Keller's books especially the earlier stuff
though the later is more elaborated but more hastily written and thus for
me not as satisfying a read. Also Marion Namenwirth's stuff. Both address
women and science / women and technology mostly having to do with the way
the cultures of science and tech work and showing how scientific knowledge
is "skewed" by male perceptions. Very interesting and at times even
exciting stuff.

Somebody mentioned Avital Ronnell and I think Stein was also cited.

I would add Donna Haraway's _Simians, Cyborgs and Women_ (her "Manifesto

Still the best single source on "pomo" topics there is.

Anything by Sandra Harding on feminism & science would also be of value,
tho she is, by nature, a more "normative" academic author. Meaghan Morris
(sp?) has done work on malls that would be good to juxtapose with
Baudelaire & w/ Benjamin on Baudelaire. (and, generally, I don't agree that
people have gone beyond Benjamin in writing on technology, with the
possible exception of Haraway. Benjamin's work has brought forth an
enormous amount of deritive drivel, attempts at a politicized MacLuhanism.
But it's precisely how he is NOT a MacLuhan that is of interest.

I'd add Kathy Acker and several poets whose work shows up in discussion on
this list.

Meow Press (Joel Kuszai's inventive imprint) has recently published, as a
Meow Press Textbook, TECHNOLOGY/art: 20 Brief Proposals for Seminars on Art
& Technology. These brief proposals were made in 1984 by a group of poets
(Bruce Andrews, Charles Bernstein, and James Sherry), at the request of
Jesse Ausubel, who was then Director of Programs at the National Academy of
Engineering, to increase the dialogue between artists and scientists and
engineers. It was this book which provoked my recent consideration of the
alphabet as a technology.

I've enjoyed these lists, which in many cases sent me back to my own
shelves - a process which throws up Feynmann (fine drummer, yes?),
Chatwin's Songlines and Julian of Norwich has to be worth continuing. In my
case the bedside/chairside/deskside/briefcase distinction doesn't work,
because the bedside books tend to move to the breakfast table, the
breakfast books come to work and so on - i.e. they all move. Which is what
a good book should do... Here goes: 1. Active in Airtime 4 : latest ed, of
Essex University based magazine edited by John Muckle & Ralph Hawkins.
2. Robin Blaser: The Holy Forest.
3. Ulla Dydo's Stein Reader. I needed this book years ago. 4. Ian Hamilton

7. Michael Palmer: At Passages (Haven't got beyond the lovely Ben Watkins

Burt:

Sure, the music is poetry is an absolutely crucial part of it.  All I'm
trying to get at is that the visual aspect of it is crucial *too*.  What
about the role drama played in Greek poetry and in the poetry of the man
we've come to call "The" Bard?  Certainly there's a massive visual emphasis
present as well.  And even before writing, what do we know about the role of
gesture in language (essence or history?)  Seems to me neither Ong nor
Derrida (at least in _Orality and Literacy_ and _On Grammatology_) deal with
the gestural component of language, and the role of the body and the eye in
that, and I think it might add an interesting dimension to this debate.
Anyone have any insights into this?

Sure, art creates illusion, language creates illusion, reality creates
illusion too.  But that's not all any of these things create, and I hope
it's not the intention of art, language or reality to leave us stranded in
illusion (what a bummer that would be!)

Steve Carll,

Yes! Gesture!
This has actually been the term I've been using to describe to myself recent
writings of my own. It's about duration & is a quality much Zen poetry has.
So, maybe, _through_ duration the graphic aspect is more, I almost want to
say "powerfully" or "perfectly" inscribed-- but no, it's that the illusion
(concrete &/or abstract) is more particularly revealed. The speed of it fuks
up the artifice, not to remove it, but revel/reveal it as/at-- well it's
actually making "the world" or the room or _something_. The mistake of any
writing is the given & the procedure. The mistake is doing it, not the before
or after. In recent work I think Grenier's box & Scalapino generally are
operating in this area. Sometimes Howe perhaps, but in another sense, it
seems more 'polished' yet it keeps that, to refer to another conversation,
ability to take yr top off. & Ron S. (if you're out there, what's the role of
revision in N/O? or the alphabet generally-- do you not do it?) & Carla H, &
M. Neilson, you can talk abt a lot of work usefully with these terms I think,
but there's danger of stretching the term too far. Raworth! Gesture that just
keeps going. Makes it live. God I hardly ever use exclamation marks. I'm
gonna go have a beer.

Nice post from Silliman re Larry Eigner. The wonderful nouny-ness of
Larry's Mass. poetry was also part;y aided by virtue of the fact that
he had a towerish room with windows on all sides, so he could look at
Swampscott he could not walk thru. Get it all by eye. There was an
old story that when Olson was taken up the road to see Eigner, he
could not handle Larry's condition and appearance. Gad, what a
comparison he must have felt. Eigner's poetry, so many years of it,
needs some critical work, doesnt it? Where are the young ones with

_Force_was composed almost entirely via revision. Most of the rest of
the Alphabet uses it very sparingly (most finished manuscripts are
99.99 percent unrevised, but it seldom ever gets quite all the way to
100 percent--I find spelling errors or realize an inversion that would
do wonderful things to the prosody or discover I've forgotten a word).
As I recall, O had a little revision in it, but N almost none
whatsoever, given its methodology that anything went.

Subject:      Free Verse

I'd like to ask some questions.

1. Is there a distinct difference, according to any criterion at
all, between free verse and formal verse, or is there a spectrum
ranging from most formal to most free?

2. Are there different distinguishable kinds of free verse?

3. Is free verse more visual than formal verse--does it have more
spatiality, either in the imagination or on the page or both?

4.  Does anyone talk about "cadence" any more?

5. Can there be a free-verse "foot" ?

I am not sure whether asking these questions is more like throwing
matches into a haystack or throwing matches into a pond, but I guess
I will find out.

Steve,

Okay, I'm convinced (especially since I'm a Paul Blackburn fan from way
back, and nowadays a fan of Richard Kosetelanetz).  But of course if
I were to close my eyes and just listen to the Bard, I'd get something
that possessed a sense of unity.  On the other hand what you say has
been getting me to do some serious reexaminations (timed with a piece
on NPR today about a multi-sense entry at the Biennale), and you are
convincing me, I'm afraid.

Help!

I've been "away"  a lot from my machine lately   found this in
note-book , dated 2 July, that began with various problems to do with
a narrative in progress (slow) and got round to affairs of this list,
so:

"         reverse thinking :
                   is a good EXERCISE
         but it is like EXERCISES
      not the performance itself
    unless it is an end in itself
   to improve one's aerobic capacities   "

even chance activities do not escape the Rules governing the
Space of production or performance (set by the owners of
spaces)  and    also     the "scene"  of writing for the writer is
another hidden determinant

(there was more, but there's something missing from the scribbled
entry and the above is a gist)
in a back-channel re-exercises or experiments  for writers
to Charles Bernstein some
moons ago I suggested that

the rules governing cut-up and chance procedures with appropriated
texts were applicable ONLY to the texts in hand and were not
generalizable to all and any occasions (certainly my experience
with that), so that "exercises and experiments"  or "rehearsals" as they
seemed were
in practice "performances"       the categories merge

are Chopin Studies "exercises"?   or J.S.Bach Inventions or B Bartok
Mikrokosmos?

To the question:

 Does anyone talk about "cadence" any more?

I'd say yes in the realm of open mike readings the rising of voice and
meter is essential in claiming the ear of your audience.  It is more
difficult to achieve on the page, but thrilling when heard by the author
in a live reading.  Personally I use cadence often when doing a reading;
I find using a breathless voice that allows the words to tumble out of my
mouth and land in a hurried jumble builds anticipation and appreciation for
the softer slow phonetic sounds that I like to end with, however the
trick is to still be understood and interpreted by the audience.  This
takes great skill that I haven;t quite mastered.
        Verse form doesn't matter so much as cadence is purely a live
thing. How to read a poem is purely subjective in my mind.  After hearing
tapes of Tennyson read it has greatly affected the way I read him now.

Regarding Lindz's belief that "Verse form doesn't matter so much as cadence
is purely a live thing. How to read a poem is purely subjective in my
mind."

The live utterance can certainly put its stamp on cadence, but the language
used has something to do with it as well. I know that in years when I was
teaching, reading Emily Dickinson aloud was useful, but it was meant to
bring the written magic out, not to inject something that wasn't really
there at all in the writing. So, no, cadence is not "purely a live thing."
Reading a poem is also not purely subjective, although it may be subjective
within limits established by the language of the poem.

As to your description, Lindz, of your own readings, are you talking about
a voicing of the words entirely disassociated from the writing, or are the
"words that tumble out of [the] mouth and land in a hurried jumble" and the
"softer slower phonetic sounds" represented in the language as written. If
not, I don't see why they can't be. The language is capable of
accomplishing such acts, written or voiced. Hearing it is something else,
and we're (the big WE of culture) not teaching that very well, I don't
think.

It would be useful to know, from those of you who teach poetry, what
percentage of time you take in your classes to read poems aloud, and to
have students read poems aloud. Sounds terribly simple, but I always found
it to be perhaps the most useful thing to do, at any level in the
educational experience.

re Charles Alexander's post.  I've only "taught poetry" a couple of
times, but agree that reading aloud is rather important.  Otherwise I
would be puzzled how to begin, when the poem says something, but not
very much, and too little when compared with someone actually doing
a performance of it (reciting/reading). Hearing Robert Creeley
sounding entirely like Robert Creeley, reading William Carlos Williams
a couple of weeks back gave me a lot of what I took to be the
pleasure of Williams poem. It was nice to hear Creeley enjoy it, and
that enjoyment was what got me going: (to hell with the old
subjective/objective talk). I guess an accomplished practitioner of
poetry can hear someone else's poem move off the page and into the
air, as they'd like their own to do.
   Anything else interesting  is the talk generated
by the reading and hearing it.  I can't believe in an interpretative
attempt on painting/sculpture etc that doesn't stem from a
performance of "looking", or music crit that has not been listening.
The effort, and it is a big effort of attention, is one of the
important things that makes any art-writing live.
   So if, as Charles says, this is not much done (hard to believe
people on this list don't do it!), something could be wrong with
teaching somewhere.  [Sure it's a hobby-horse and I've said this
before in similar circumstances, for which I don't apologise.]

Sure, there can be a free verse foot. In fact there cannot not be. A
foot is any principal stress with any number (say from 0 to 4) of
secondary etc stresses. Or in quantity the equivalent. Just walk
while you're reading the poem. It wasnt called an "elbow."

Subject:      LitNet Call-In Day Defending NEA

Dear Friends:

I am writing to all of you who helped with *Freely Espousing* in the first
months of 1995 with some information that I hope you will consider acting
on.

LitNet, the advocacy organization that has been struggling these past
months (and years) to preserve federal arts funding for the writing
community, has announced a Congressional call-in day on Tuesday, 11 July.
The goal of the action is to ensure that a Senate reauthorization bill
(S.856), scheduled for mark-up in the Committee on Labor & Human Relations
sometime this week, not be crippled by amendments that would adversely
affect literature.

Although the bill is not ideal, its current form does allow for individual
writers and literary publishers and organizations to apply for federal
grants; budgetary reductions are set at 2% per year over five years.  (As
most of you know,this is a much less draconian vision of the NEA's future
than the one recently articulated in the House.)

LitNet recommends the following specific messages:

1) If you live in Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio,
Tennessee or Vermont, consider using the following argument:

        I am a resident of your state and a member of the Literary Network.
I'm
calling to ask you to support a reauthorization bill for the National
Endowment for the Arts that does *not* increase the amount of money already
allocated to the state arts agencies.  Literature is a uniquely national
art form--sending more money to the states would effectively eliminate the
NEA literature program.  Also, please support federal funding for direct
grants to individual writers and grants that require small arts
organizations (such as non-profit publishers and literary centers) to raise
only 1:1 matching funds.  Thank you for your time and attention.

2)  If you live in New Mexico or Oregon:

        I am a resident of your state and a member of the Literary Network.
I'm calling to ask you to support as large an appropriation as possible
for the National Endowment for the Arts in FY96.  Also, please support an
appropriations bill that *does not* increase allocations to the state arts
agencies and that *does* continue to fund fellowships for individual
writers and grants to small arts organizations such as non-profit
publishers and literary centers.  Thank you for your time and attention.

3)  If you live in Washington, Senator Gorton is a member of both
committees.  Please tell him you wish to leave two messages and then tell
him (1) and (2) above.

If you can't call on Tuesday, call on Monday or Wednesday.  If you have
friends living in any of the mentioned states, please take five minutes and
contact them about this very important effort.

Finally, Anne Burt can only hone LitNet's efficacy if she knows what people
out there are doing:  call her at 1-212-741-9110 and let her know what
action you have taken, or fax her at 1-212-741-9112.

I could not imagine teaching a poetry course without reading the
poems aloud (as well as using tapes etc, such as the CD-ROM of
"Poetry in Motion"), but more important, reading the poems aloud. It
would be like teaching an art course without looking at any paintings
etc.

        Ron Silliman:

        Olson was actually a heavy reviser, though to be sure there are
passages in which he seems to be saying "first thought, best thought."

        I did a lot of work in the Archive at Connecticut when it was
still very primitively cataloged, and I would find a manuscript of this or
that poem, and I point it out to George Butterick who would say, "Oh, yes,
there are alot of those."

        Olson would completely re-copy or "re-vision" poems-- often
changing only  a few words or line breaks, etc.

        Later he did not so much revise as throw away. Poems begin on
whatever piece of paper at hand and frequently end with increasingly
illegible scribbles. It appears that the more or less completed poems
(always a question, of course, what is complete?) did get written
straight through, but sometimes after several stabs.

        You could say that he didn't revise much, but he wrote many poems
that were very similar to one another.

I agree that the initial play is in the writing of the poem, but a certain
life comes from the skill of the reader.  It's partciallly the personal
aspect that is added, the intimacy of the poet reading.  But I often think
I'd like to hire and direct an actor to read my poems, because I can't
always present them in the exact way I see them in my head or on the page.
I also found when friends share poems and read each other's works aloud
two very different products emerge.
         In live reading I have two goals. First,I like to make poetry less
a part of myself and more of a moment, a dramatic experience rather than a
revelations of myself.  I think the page is something we can hide behind
as writers.  Symbols on a page conveying images of thoughts and moments
that have already past.  Live readings alter this perception as they
audience thinks they are witnessing the exposure of the poet.  Which isn't
necessarily true, but an excellent form of manipulation by the poet.
        Second, how to read a poem must be taught, and among my non-post
secondary educated friends written works do not reach them.  Yet bring
them to a live experience and they are transformed.  I try to include them
in my writing.  I take the skills I have learned in my education and apply
them in a form that they will understand and enjoy.  Poems were never read
aloud in my experience until I took a 3rd year English course that
surveyed 20th century lit.  My prof did an amazing reading of Plath's
"Daddy", now that is cadence in action.  Most of my profs were too shy to
read aloud to the class.

Now this gives me a jolt!  I had no recollection of *water* being involved in
that piece, but now that Ron mentions it I do have a vague glimmer of a
proposal involving water.  Was it in a text on the wall at that show?  Was it
just something we talked about?  I'm not sure, but I don't remember ever
actually executing a piece in water.  Now days, of course, what would be fun
is holography:  project the words into the whole space.  (The person who has
done the most work with words and holography to my knowledge is Eduardo Kac.)

The show Ron is talking about (how nice to have it remembered!) was called
Temporary Poetry 10/73.  I do still have some documentation of it, and one of
these days I'm going to get a scanner and put some of that stuff up on my
web.  (Right now all I have there is a brief paragraph describing it.)

I did one other installation, at the Kitchen in NY in May of 75.

It was, as I recall, the series of cards on the floor, a word per card.

There's this overpriced "poetry magnet" game, little words on
magnetized squares for play on the refrigerator or wherever, these
days, and it was modeled after that.

(Actually, that game has never much appealed to me, but I have thought
of using computer programs to pull out characteristic vocabularies and
do Stein, Kerouac, Hemingway, Faulkner, etc. versions of that.)

Just saw the big Cage show here in Philadelphia yesterday. Very much in
that same spirit. There's a "program your own score" computer game in
it, move the mouse and click to get different effects and one of my
three year olds, Jesse, did such for about 10 minutes with a half dozen

Compound Eye, edited by poet Ange Mlinko (see a poem of hers in the

With Lawrence's *novels*, however, there was much revision.  Three
complete versions of *Lady Chatterley's Lover*.  It would be interesting
to hear some talk about revision and spontenaeity as generically
differentiated values.

With regard to Ashbery, this is from the Appendix to John Shoptaw's pretty
interesting new book, *On the Outside Looking Out*:

"Soon after finishing 'A Wave,' Ashbery articulated his poetics of
revision: 'I like the idea of being as close to the original thought
or voice as possible and not to falsify it by editing.'  (*Paris Review*
90, Winter 1983, 53).  When working not with a 'thought or voice' but
with pages of written text, Ashbery keeps to the original by keeping new
writing to a minimum.  Rather than changing the fabric of his text by
rewriting or interpolating phrases and lines, Ashbery revises from the
outside by cutting and restitching -- scrapping what doesn't work and
leaving the reconnected pieces relatively intact.  When this method
fails, he starts over with a new original performance.  Thus Ashbery can
revise heavily and still keep close to an, if not the, original.

(Shoptaw p. 343, cite added to text from endnote).

David

In Ireland the fate of modernism is also very complicated, partly by the
overwhelming "International Modernist" presence of Joyce.  But certainly
the post-Yeats Irish poet who has gotten the most play in the States
(Heaney) could be called po-mo only by the most elastic of definitions,
and some of the most startlingly experimental (Devlin, Kinsella) are
barely read at all here.  Of course, McGuckian and Muldoon are relatively
well-known, but their language practices are tamed (and partly produced)
by American theoretical discourse.

Subject:      Re: DON'T BE SO PHONOCENTRIC

Regarding Ameslan [American Sign Language] poetry, you might check the
anthology SYMPOSIUM OF THE WHOLE (edited by myself & Diane Rothenberg) for
the article "Poetry without Sound" by Edward S. Klima and Ursual Bellugi.
Bellugi has done terrific work in this area & early contacted me on the
relation of signing poetry to the way in which I and others had been
approaching oral poetry in the course of doing (so called) "total trans-
lation."  Dennis Tedlock and I then published this piece in Alcheringa
(our magazine of ethnopoetics) with my very strong sense that what was
involved touched on a dimension of poetry that made pure oralism inadequate,
however much we had then been (or continued to be) commited to a speech
model.  I made an attempt (around 1976/77) to work out an experimental
approach to a total translation from Ameslan, collaborating with the deaf
poet Joe Castronovo, who was himself a native signer.  But circumstances got
in the way & we never followed through on it, although since then I've come
on the work of performance poets composing in ASL & have been hoping to see
how much further it would go.

I'll print out the headnote I wrote for Bellugi piece, in case it's of
interest.

Jerome Rothenberg

POETRY WITHOUT SOUND.   Even in its early, tentative stages, the signing
poetry emerging as an aspect of the "culture of the deaf" challenges some of
our cherished preconceptions about poetry and its relation to human speech.
Ameslan (American Sign Language) represents, literally, a poetry without
sound and, for its practitioners, a poetry without access to that experience
of sound as voice that we've so often taken as the bedrocks of all poetics
and all language.  In the real world of the deaf, then, language exists as a
kind of writing in space and as a primary form of communication without
reference to any more primary form of language for its validation.  It is
in this sense a realization of the ideogrammatic vision of a Fenollosa -- "a
splendid flash of concrete poetry" -- but an ideogrammatic language truly in
motion and, like oral poetry, truly inseparable from its realization in per-
formance.  (Ethnopoetic analogues -- for those who would care to check them
out -- include Hindu and Tantric mudras, Plains Indian and Australian
Aborigine sign languages, and Ejagham [southeastern Nigerian] "action
writing": a history of human gesture languages that would enrich our sense
of poetry and language, should we set our minds to it.) // The reader may
also want to relate this piece to recent discourse about "written-oral
dichotomies, etc., but the revelation of Ameslan, in that sense, isn't a
denial of the powers of oral poetry but the creation of its possible and
equally impermanent companion in performance.

--------

A few additional thoughts.  We had around that time seen an extraordinary
performance of Four Saints in Three Acts by the Theater of the Deaf -- a
startling and revelaing interplay between spoken and signed language.  And
I'm remembering too that in Shaking the Pumpkin -- the Indian assemblage I
did in early 70s -- I included a signing piece (& probably compared it to
something or other, altho I'm not going to bother to check).  Also, the
Klima-Bellugi essay didn't originally appear in Alcheringa, but in the
followup magazine, New Wilderness Letter, that I had started up in 1976.  It
remains, anyway, an area of interest, and I'm hoping someone out there may
have information on more recent happenings, etc.  (And, needless to say, the
Klima-Bellugi essay is of much more interest than my intro to it.)

The recent Shoptaw book gets into his process (_On the Outside Looking Out:
John Ashbery's Poetry_ Harvard $24.00 pb geeze). Similar actually to what
Byrd was describing re Olson.
Apparently, he tends to cut more than rewrite, & when cutting doesn't work
he'll write "the same poem" over again. The body of Shoptaw's text contains
quite a bit of discussion of process. There's  also an appendix which
reprints early drafts of "A Wave."

Coolidge is another & very good question.

thanks Chris Scheil, cheering up my Tuesday.  The Debord quote is
cute. As a "historian" I'd appreciate it if them intellectuals
realised that "history" is not dead but displaced.  Yesterday, I
said, (and this is without a word of a lie, I swear on my New Mail
Folder, ) the Death of the Author must be "the displacement of the
author".  I should now add "The End of Art" must be the displacement
of  art. Is Ron Silliman (rather than T.Pynchon) the novelist of our
time?

Now, there's a historian's question?  Or should it be that a reading
of say Ketjak quickly reaches into the moment of the reader's
on-going fragmentary narrative of what she/he is doing these days and
out to a projection onto the figure of the writer of the book of a
like situation of narration.

If "history" proves to be once more no more than narration, however,
displaced, it could supercede the notion of that "history" that old
D.Bored evokes (The Onward March of Time in which our acts are
supposed to be irrevocably immersed as we muse on its telos).

The needs of one person for another have not ceased and that means
families and generations and their narratives are forever investing
in narrative, linking presents and pasts and futures. All that is
required to transfer this kind of historicising to more public issues
is the contemplation of the insubstantial but necessary artifices of
narrative.

That sense of unity is an interesting area, too, since the page also creates
one.  Is it "composed" in the brain, as I suspect, out of all the input from
all the senses  (wish I'd caught the NPR program)?  I'm told that people
blind from birth can visualize.  Do deaf people similarly audiate?

Subject: private press survey
------ cut here --------------------------------------------------------------
Purely out of curiosity, I have prepared a questionnaire for private presses.
The purpose of this questionnaire is to discover the nature and behaviour of
private presses as businesses. As an amateur printer, I am interested in how
those who charge for their wares go about doing it. I was inspired by an
article called "The Economics of Printing Limited Editions" which appeared in
"Fine Print" in 1987. If I get a reasonable sample, I may be able to
compile the information in some useful format.

Anyway, if anyone is interested in seeing the survey, mail me at
scoombs@ie.oracle.com (or scoombs@us.oracle.com, if the first doesn't work).

Note that this has nothing to do with Oracle Corporation.

Hello, David Kellogg:

How would you say Medbh McGuckian's "language practices" are "tamed"
and/or "partially produced by American theoretical discourse"? I just don't
see it. A fondness for metaphysical abstraction/surreal metaphor, maybe.
Now I'm wondering what you make of Nuala Ni Dhomnhaill.

On a different thread: has anyone seen Bunuel's film BELLE DE JOUR?
If so, would you say it was "tamed" and/or "partially produced by"
bourgeois sex fancies? (thanks for the handy formulation, David!) I was
talking with Jonathan Levin about this and we can't figure out if this is an
offensively unselfconscious film or a knowing revolt against its own
quasi-banality

From the span of my own movie seat, Scorsese's involvement in its
revival doesn't clarify the situation any!!

Bye for now--- (wondering about yr bedside movies)

I cant imagine profs not reading poems aloud. Even TA's? Gad.
Yr esp. right when you say that what the person is reading is (or shd

so why should anyone orentend that the poet is somehow using them to

It was a toss-off comment, to be sure.  As to what I meant....  I was
thinking about some reviews in American litmags of McGuckian which seemed
to connect almost gleefully to her type of experimentation.  This reaction
I attribute to her confirming (brilliantly I'd hasten to add) certain
reviewer expectations about what an experimental poet should be up to,
expectations themselves fueled by the lit-theory mindset.  Nuala Ni
Dhomnhaill hasn't yet provoked that sort of exhileration among American
reviewers.  It's not a bad thing; please don't think I'm slagging Medbh.
I actually think she's an outrageously good poet.  All I'm saying is that
"theory" is part of her context, and that we might well take into account
the local institutional consequences of that context (how "theory" is
different in Ireland and America, for example) in a transnational literary
environment.

Cheers,
David

I think the only reason the poem gets mistaken for a representation of
the poet is because writing can come from two places; experience and the
soul.  It is difficult to mask these qualities.  the artist emerges some
where in the middle.

I tend to think the writing comes from any number of places, probably more
than two. Returning to the Ashbery process discussion for a minute. In the
_Code of Signals_ interview he has a useful statement-- "I'm interested in
the way experience filters through me." You could say Cage was interested in
the same thing, he just had a cleaner filter, maybe the cleanest.

. . .a little more on this question of where it ("the writing") comes from.
Perhaps best to say: from multiplicity, through multiplicity, to
multiplicity. Even that too linear. Seems one needs to include contingency
and cognitive limits. I mean the terms "experience" and "soul" could just as
well be "assumptions" and "sensibility"-- neither set of terms telling us all
that much. This is why the gestural, again. To include the contingency, the
not knowing maybe is what makes the beauty. Which is it's own set of
problems.

I guess.

          My son, Max, is 9 years old and has been writing stories
          since he was 6.  He has about 9 stories posted at a WWW site
          called KidPub.  At the end of each of his stories is the
          chance to write to Max via my email address.   He's gotten
          about 10 responses and this is how he responded to a
          question on how he came up with his story "World Leaders
          Become Zombies":

          "I didn't really get an idea off the top of my head.  It
          just came to me while I was writing the story.  The hardest
          part was trying to think of the title.  What I do with all
          my titles is that I think of a monster like a vampire or
          some other scary creature then I give it a finishing touch."

          His response reminded me of a writing process class I had at
          UCSD as an undergraduate.  We read an article that put forth
          the idea that when we write we don't think and then write
          down what we are thinking, we simply write.  I totally
          identified with this idea but the rest of the class thought
          the author had gone Bali Ha'i.

I think the creative process is a drive, a need that I must satisfy,
therefore it makes complete sense(to me anyway) that actual thought is not
the initial element in writing.  Writing is an action, if I just thought
about it I'd never do it.
I once had to go through an interview for an advanced painting class
because I had had no formal training, the prof asked me " Why do you paint?"
I replied, " I don't know I just do, it's something that just happened."
He let me in the class.  I think the same happens in writing.  Children
are the best examplesof this because they haven't been tainted by the
thoery or the philosophy behind the process.

Subject:      Re: teaching

There have been, of late, several comments related to issues of
teaching poetry.  As I prepare for a course this Fall in Modern
American Poetry, I've found myself thinking over a few similar
issues.

First, I agree with those who have argued for reading aloud in class.
Of course.  Over the years, I have collected a good many audio and
video tapes.  I read aloud in class; the students read aloud in class
(and, presumably, at home).  And I am able to present in class a
reading of poems by the poet.  (And, at times, point out that the
poet has often read a poem aloud, over time, in different ways.)

Second issue is, for me, a practical one.  Any recommendations for
how to present Zukofsky?  I have about two weeks set aside, and cost
of books is an issue.  If you were to pick a few things by Z to teach
(to graduate students--most in the MFA program, most of whom will
have read nothing by Z, virtually nothing by Stein or Williams,
probably familiar with Eliot, passing acquaintance maybe with Pound)
what would you teach?

Third is a perhaps apocryphal story about Robert Duncan.  I heard the
story nearly 25 years ago, and it concerned the way Duncan allegedly
began a poetry (poetry writing?) class at UC Santa Cruz.  He said
that there would be two basic rules in the course:  1) they would not
be discussing students' poetry in class; 2) he would do almost all of
the talking.  When I frist heard the story, I though, what an
arrogant asshole.  I had begun to take a few writing workshops, and
thought ill of Duncan's anti-democratic rules.  Over the years, I can
see what he may have been doing.  The workshop methodology has indeed
proven to be trivial and narrow--a kind of auto repair approach to
tinkering with the unambitious and tidy poem.  And the students will
inevitably form their most important associations (for discussing
poems too) outside of class among themselves.  Duncan could certainly
meet individually with students to talk over their poems.  And
needless to say, he did have a lot to say.

Fourth has to do with the issue that Rod Smith raised about the
importance of teaching via not-knowing.  I offer the following
excerpt from Bob Perelman's fine book _The Trouble with Genius_ (p.
165):

But her [Stein's] account of first being invited to teach is
revealing.  The invitation was the result of an angry blowup upon
meeting Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler of the University of
Chicago.  This is the only place I can recall in her work where she
represents herself as losing control.  Adler's list of "all the ideas
that had been important in the world's history" causes Stein first to
get "excited" and then "violent" (EA, 205-7).  She is invited to
teach Adler's class the next week, where, predictably, she triumphs.
Afterward she explains to Hutchins: "You see why they talk to me is
that I am like them I do not know the answer, you you say you do not
know but you do know if you did not know the answer you could not
spend your life in teaching but I I really do not know ... that is
the trouble with governments and Utopia and teaching, the things not
that can be learnt but that can be taught are not interesting" (EA,
213).

I'd be very curious to hear how others go about basing their teaching
on what they don't know.  Or how various ones of you balance teaching
between an orientation toward a "delivery" of what you know and a
shared exploration of what you don't know.  Personally, I hope that
Stein is wrong.  It is, I hope, possible to sustain a career in
teaching precisely by basing that activity in a substantial amount of
not knowing.  (Though such an approach has a great capacity to annoy
and baffle some students.)  If not--if Stein's right--my career's
about over....

--ironic--have been reading MHAbrams mirror and lamp (comps!) all day to
day, and here we are rehashing what we have been since Aristotle, Plato,
et.al. . . .  MHA employes a triangle, something like this:

                                UNIVERSE

                                 WORK

                          ARTIST         AUDIENCE

Arrows point up from work to universe, and down from work to artist and
audience, implying that the work (writing) mediates between the artist
and the audience.
I would argue that in todays postmodern writing, thinking, criticism,
being, the arrows would all have to be double.  That is to say all of
these elements mediate one upon--for and against--the other.

Where does writing come from--my soul/your soul, my experience/your
experience--today I am working on a poem about Appolo, the sun, my skin,
and knowledge--where does this come from?  Partly a centuries old myth--a
work (and does that include the soul, experience, whatever of its author,
lost to us (except in this text) forever?  And his/her audience?
Universe?)--it "works" on me--

I like that!  I like to think of writing as labor--and now I can add work
to that, too!

off the top thinking of Hank Lazer and teaching. (the G Stein episode
is fascinating, I must get hold of Perelman's book) :  monologue is often
 useful as a delivery style, yes, but always seems
most useful when it is made plain at some point that it stems from a
reading that has posed questions that cannot be finally layed to rest
by anyone....announcing "I wish I knew,( or that I could know, or
could think of a way to find out") is a way of

Only from those two places?

In some senses (pardon the pun) and not in others.  There may be an actual
physical silence in reading, but I always experience an inner voice reading
"aloud" to me, as it were, so I don't experience it as silent.  But then
again, there is the silence from which all sound arises that I am sometimes
aware of (if I'm being mindful and relaxed).

I still wonder if people deaf from birth can "hear" sound in their mind

Well, I've decided to post this; apologies if the length offends anyone.  A
good half of this at least is directly relevant to recent discussions here
on prosody, and the hypertext part may be interesting to some.  Some of what
I am saying here directly echoes [prefigures?] what George Bowering had to
say about foot, though in somewhat more detail.

A few caveats.  Since I wrote this, the word "agency" has generated a good
deal of discomfort, and I'm not sure I'm crazy about it myself, but I haven't
yet thought of a better word, so I've left it in.  There is a passing
reference here to "conjunctive hypertext"; this is a concept I introduced at
the European Conference on Hypermedia Technology last fall (detail in
http://www.well.com/user/jer/NNHI.html); to make a long story very short,
conjunctive hypertext is hypertext where the components have a logical relation
of "and" to one another rather than "or" (you can choose this link *or* that
one, etc.) -- I can explain this in more detail if need be, but this
article is already long enough.

This was originally posted to ht_lit, which is a list for literary hypertext.

              Notes Toward a Non-linear Prosody of Space

I.  Linear Metrics

1.  Background:  Dimensions of inequality among syllables

The fundamental axiom of prosody in English is that all syllables are not
created equal.  (This is not the case in all languages; in Japanese,
apparently, syllables are considered equal enough, metrically, that they are
simply counted rather than being distinguished by structural patterns.)  By
plotting the time sequence of how these inequalities occur one obtains
metrics -- a double plural, meaning a multitude of metrics.  The most well
known is the stress degree metric, which forms most of the discussion below,
but there are several others.  (1) Pitch Degrees.  Although I have not
analyzed this in detail, there is a prosody at work in many American
communities, most notably in a style of reading in the black community, in
which I believe *pitch degrees* play a more important role than stress
degrees.  This forms the basis of an incredibly rich prosody, a different
prosody than the classical one, which must be analyzed on its own terms.
Whereas stress is a linguistic property, pitch is a purely acoustical
property; thus a pitch degree prosody is more absolutely musical -- in a
literal sense -- than a stress degree prosody.  A pitch degree prosody is
more free to use an absolute musical sense of time and structure; the sound
structure balance is different -- not all phonemes carry pitch.  Where a
pitch degree prosody and a stress degree prosody are present at the same
time, incredibly subtle effects are possible. Pitch degree prosody deserves
extensive analysis in its own right.

(2) Vowel Position Degrees.  Again, my impressions here are based on
intuition rather than detailed analysis.  My understanding of this goes back
to a somewhat delphic comment by Robert Duncan.  Duncan spoke often of "tone
leading vowels" in talking about Pound.  Not understanding what he meant by
this, but wanting to know more, at a reading once I asked him where in
Pound's writings I could find the discussion of tone leading vowels.  To my
total astonishment, he replied that it *wasn't anywhere*; Pound had used the
term in letters to Duncan, simply assuming that Duncan would understand what
he meant; Duncan was left to figure it out for himself.  Hearing this I
simply couldn't resist: "Well, what is it??"  Duncan said two things, one of
which was quite straightforward, the other of which was extremely obscure. He
explained that when a diphthong (a glide from one "pure vowel" to another)
occurs, the "leading tone", i.e. the pure vowel at which the glide begins,
plays a special role in terms of later reinforcement.  So far so good.  Then
he said: "When you hear a sound, it's reinforced when you hear it again.  But
it can also be reinforced when you *don't* hear it again."  Just as Duncan
was left to figure out on his own what Pound meant by "tone leading vowels",
I felt strongly that I should simply accept this remark as a gift and work on
my own to figure out what it meant; I didn't ask anything else.

I certainly don't wish to be in the business of interpreting Robert Duncan,
even less interpreting Duncan interpreting Pound; but the train of thought
that started with Duncan's remark has ended up with the idea of a vowel
position degree metric.  Vowels are sometimes diagrammed as a trapezoid which
plots the position of the tongue in the mouth.  I believe (again this is
based on intuition, not analysis) that the possible vowel positions tend to
cluster into just a few groupings, and that the plot of which grouping occurs
at a given moment forms a metric.  This metric is probably superimposed on
the stress degree metric, again giving a very fluid effect.  (I don't know if
this has anything at all to do with "tone leading vowels", but I certainly do
hear something like this frequently when I read or listen to Pound.)

2.  The Classical Stress-Degree Metric Stereotype

Before giving my own approach to the stress-degree metric, let me briefly
sketch the stereotype most people have for how this works.  If you want to
argue that the stereotype is not accurate in scanning this or that poet, I
would hardly disagree; but I think this stereotype does have a lot to do with
attitudes towards metrics.  Hopefully, by presenting a different approach,
the stereotype can be broken.

There exist -- a priori, in advance of any particular poems -- a collection
of abstract patterns of stress degrees.  These patterns may be called
*templates*.  They tend to have names, e.g. iamb ('|), trochee (|'), anapest
(|'') etc.  (I'm using ' for an unstressed syllable, | for a stress.)
*Scanning* is an activity consisting of pattern-matching template instances
against the words of the poem.  In the most formalized case, we say a line
"scans" if repeated instances of the same template, end to end, match against
the words of the line.  There is a tendency to speak of poets "writing in" a
meter, which means choosing a template in advance and writing lines which
will scan to that template.

Readers familiar with prosody terminology may note with some surprise that so
far I have not mentioned the word 'foot'.  Unfortunately, the word 'foot' is
deeply ambiguous:  It has at least two wildly different uses in prosody.
Because I believe this plays a crucial role in the widespread prejudice
against and misunderstanding of metrics by many people, I want to explain
this in detail, and will propose a different terminology to avoid the
problem. Meanings of the word 'foot':  (1) 'Foot' is often used to designate
*a type of template*.  (E.g. one speaks of "an iamb".)  As such it is part of
an a priori scheme, given in advance of the poem.  (2) 'Foot' is used to
designate the group of syllables *in the actual poem* which is matched by one
of the templates.  In this usage, a foot is a unit of meter:  just above the
syllable, which is the atomic unit for metrics, and below the metric line.
(Of course this is not meant to deny that a foot can contain just one
syllable or a line one foot.)  I.e. here foot is a living breathing part of
the poem, with a specific tangible identity in a metrical structure.

Many different strains in poetics, such as the Open Forms of the Black
Mountain poets and Improvisational Composition of the beats, have led in
directions away from the a priori, away from choosing a fixed form given in
advance.  Because the concept of 'foot' is so closely linked with a system of
a priori templates, this has led to a sad neglect of metrics generally, and
to interest in the concept of mapping the metrical structure of living
breathing poems specifically.  To avoid this problem, in what follows I will
use the term *measure* for a unit of meter intermediate between the syllable
and the line where we make no assumption in advance for what shape a measure
may take.

3.  Bonding Strength

I wish to propose yet another dimension along which syllables can vary:
bonding strength.  Actually bonding strength applies not to syllables but to
the boundaries between adjacent syllables.  Before going into the details of
how this works, it is important to note two important points about this
methodology.  (1) The methodology applies against *the sound* of the poem. In
some cases this may be difficult to infer from a printed text absent a live
or recorded reading by the poet.  This idea will be quite threatening to
those academics who believe that all there is to know about a poem is
contained in the printed text.  However, there is nothing terribly original
in the idea that prosody means looking at the structure of *the sound*:  it
was Ezra Pound who said if you want to know about the prosody, open up your
ears and listen to the sound it makes.  (2) The methodology -- and I
emphasize that it is a *methodology*, not a theory! -- is ruthlessly
empirical.  It works by examining a recitation and trying to answer the
question:  what is the metrical structure of this recitation.  It may or may
not yield useful results for any given recitation.  It is not designed to
answer what may be a fallacious question -- what meter did the poet "write
in" -- but simply to discover whatever metrical structure happens to be
there.  Because poets build a voice, there is a reasonable chance that in
many cases conclusions can be drawn about metrical structure, but perhaps
not.

Each syllable has a *bonding strength* for the syllable before it and after
it.  By bonding strength is meant:  (artificially) inject a pause at the
syllable boundary in question, and then judge how natural the pause is
against the recitation.  There will be different degrees of naturalness --
different degrees of resistance to the injection of pause -- at different
syllable boundaries.  We say a syllable boundary has a high bonding strength
if an injected pause is extremely unnatural compared to the recitation; where
the pause is natural (or already there, of course) bonding strength is low. I
will call a *measure* a string of syllables bounded on either side by low
bonding strength and having only high bonding strength in any internal
syllable boundaries.  It is this empirical, overtly sound-based concept of
measure which I wish to use as a replacement for usage (2) of 'foot' above.

Of course this will work with any recitation; it does not have to be poetry.
I propose that the speech rhythm of English prose tends toward what I will
call *The Standard Measure*, defined by the following rules:  (1) A measure
has only one major stress; (2) the stress tends to come at the end of the
measure, but (3) if there are only unstressed syllables following the major
stress out to the end of a natural grammatical boundary, those syllables will
be incorporated into the measure.  (You can think of this as an attempt to
reformulate the classical idea that English is "predominantly iambic" while
institutionalizing the counter-examples.)  The concept of "grammatical
boundary" is really the same concept of bonding strength applied to syntax.
Although I haven't analyzed this in detail, a simple explanation would relate
grammatical bonding strength to the distance that must be traveled in a parse
tree to get the closest common antecedent to two consecutive words.

This is not to say that "the standard measure" will in fact always occur.
Robert Creeley, for instance, is well known for having many non-standard
measure breaks in his poems, and many other poets use non-standard measure
breaks quite prominently.  Detailed analysis can produce some interesting
results.  For instance, in some of Creeley's poems, lines are predominantly
either one or two measures; interestingly in the two-measure lines the
internal measure boundary is a *standard* measure break.  (I.e. the
celebrated Creeley line-break is exactly that, a line-break, not a measure-
break.)  The non-standard measure boundaries are easy to hear, but the
internal standard measure boundaries do not stand out so prominently.  (Of
course you would "hear their absence" as a lifeless regularity.)  In these
poems one could say that the grammatical structure goes from the middle of
one line to the middle of the next; but the line endings are articulated
sonically by the prominent non-standard measure boundaries.  This is a
familiar metrical structure going back hundreds of years, all the way to
Anglo-Saxon poetry.

II.  Non-linear Metrics

Prosody is traditionally the study of poetic sound structure as mapped in
time.  Because of the inherent linearity of time, this poses an obvious
problem for non-linear poetry.  Shall we say that prosody only applies within
the lexia, thus punting the problem completely?  Some may take this view, but
I find it personally distasteful.  It exempts from prosody details of
hypertext structure which I think clearly need to be considered.  In Michael
Joyce's work, the names of links are so clearly musical it takes one's breath
away: they are part of the prosody.  Given that I am on record as advocating
taking hypertext into the fine structure of language, thereby fragmenting the
lexia, I simply can't accept leaving prosody as an inherently linear concept
that applies only *inside* of lexia.

It would be nice if what follows were as well worked out as what preceded,
but at this point I have only questions and some launching points for a view
of non-linear prosody.

1.  Linear prosody as a prosody of *space*

There are some concepts in prosody that are so overtly time-based that one
simply has to give up on them in non-linear poetry.  Isochrony -- the
tendency of major stresses to fall in an even musical beat -- is one such
concept.  There may be isochrony within the lexia, but given that outside the
lexia *there is no concept of time*, in non-linear prosody one can only treat
isochrony locally.  However:  In a one-dimensional structure, time and space
are very nearly the same thing.  What may appear to be a time-based concept
may in fact be a space-based concept.  The concept of bonding strength, as
articulated above, occurs between *adjacent* syllables.  'Adjacent' is
clearly a spatial concept, not a time-based concept.  I defined bonding
strength as the resistance by a recitation to the injection of an artificial
*pause* -- time language again -- but one could just as well speak of
injecting space into the poem as time.  Thus:

2.  Spatial Bonding Strength

The concept of bonding strength works in any kind of topology.  One may speak
of the bonding strength of two adjacent units as their resistance to the
injection of artificial space.  The replacement for the concept of measure
above is a *spatial clustering*.  This has some interesting consequences for
"traditional" hypertext rhetoric.  Whereas the classical hypertext link is
typically discussed using travel vocabulary, a spatial prosody would ask the
question:

What is the bonding strength *THROUGH* the link?

(This has an interesting resonance with the Kaplan/Moulthrop concept of
hypertext warping space.)  It may be objected that in trying to assess
bonding strength through the link, one is reversing the direction of the
arrow (assuming a one-directional link, and recalling Ted Nelson's caution
that *all* links should really be bidirectional).  Well, having no problem
measuring bonding strength "against" the arrow of time in linear poetry, I
have no problem doing the same thing "against" the arrow of the link.  Travel
may be the right vocabulary to use, but one can also speak of the
*attraction* of two nodes for one another; yes, there may be an asymmetry in
link direction, but there is always an asymmetry between "located here" and
"could be located there".  In discussing hypertext there is an overt tendency
to discuss following links based on *similarity* to where one is; but perhaps
not!  Perhaps one wants to take a link based on *dissimilarity* to where one
is!  (Robert Duncan:  "A sound is reinforced when it is *not* heard again
...")

Prosody may form an overt basis for following links.  I find myself following
links in Michael Joyce's work based on sound structure all the time.  Perhaps
I'm "not supposed to do that", but I do, and without having asked him about
this I think Michael wouldn't mind that I do.

Prosody must work *THROUGH* links, not just inside "the lexia" (if one has
lexia ...)

I speak about "links" here only because that is the most familiar form of
hypertext structure; this discussion generalizes to conjunctive structures as
well.

3.  Agencies

By "agency" I mean a *unit of doing*.  Because there is an overt structure
resulting from hypertext linkage, we have a bit of a tendency to focus on
that structure rather than the structure of what the reader *does*.  Consider
the familiar node/link/lexia model.  A reader follows a series of links, then
-- for whatever reason -- decides to backtrack.  That series of nodes is a
*unit of doing*.  Unfortunately, most of the software does not treat it that
way.  For instance I can't *save the series*.  Perhaps I can save my entire
history, but I typically can't *mark it* to denote the way I think the links
clump together.  Perhaps the best I may be able to do is save my history to a
text file and then import it into some tool where I can annotate it.

Doing has boundaries, has a shape, has units.  The structure of doing unfolds
against the skeleton of the hypertext structure, but it may not be the same.
The hypertext structure may appear to be disjunctive, but the reader can *do*
conjunctive things with it anyway.  (E.g.: "*These* are the links I really
like, they seem to work together ...)  In a hypertext with conventional
lexia, there is a concept of bonding strength among lexia.

When I speak of agency, I am *not* speaking of *history*.  Agency and history
are related but are not the same. The structure of history is relentlessly
linear:  "this is the sequence of what happened ..."; the structure of agency
is likely not to be linear.  There will be clusters of doing that include the
same event.  Some agencies will stand out clearly in the reader's mind; these
may clump together even though they are isolated in time by navigations that
don't stand out in the reader's mind as a clear agency:  agencies don't
always happen.

4.  The Granularity of Agency

We have, perhaps, come far afield of prosody.  I am propounding a view of
linear prosody as clustering in one-dimensional space; from this one
generalizes to clustering in a space of arbitrary topology.  The granularity
of this clustering as it traditionally affects prosody is very fine:  down to
the level of the syllable.  A hypertext prosody granularity of space can
become this fine only when hypertext is taken into the fine structure of
language.  I am always (it seems) advocating for this, but with few takers at
present.  With a more "traditional" lexia, there is a "granularity boundary"
concerning units of prosody that are inside the lexia vs. those that
transcend the lexia.  Is the poetic lexia a stanza?  Is it a line?  Is it yet
larger than the stanza?  Even I would balk at taking hypertext inside the
*word*.  The words are given to us, by and large; it does not seem reasonable
to me to intervene in that natural process with an external administration of
hypertext structure.  It should be noted that in the discussion of linear
prosody above, the "standard" speech rhythm of English does not interpose
measure boundaries inside the word either.  If I will not intervene inside
the word with hypertext structure, and the natural rhythm of English does not
intervene inside the word, that leaves the entire measure in a hypertext
context likely to be linear.  At its finest granularity, hypertext structure
relates measures.

In the large, the structure of agency extends to the *session*.  While surely
multiple sessions will associate in the mind of the reader, just as there is
a natural limit at the measure boundary -- even though measures contain still
smaller units, namely syllables -- there is a natural boundary at the large
end of the granularity of agency at the session.  You have a well defined cut
in doing when you sign off, surely.  As obvious as this sounds, there is
still a great deal of work to be done in understanding what the identity of
the session should be.  Hypertexts tend often to be large; it can take many
sessions before the reader even begins to get a feel for how a particular
hypertext "is supposed to work".  Because the number of paths is genuinely
infinite, the reader may have no help at all in deciding when a session
should end.

Shall we say as writers, overtly and explicitly, that we *want* the reader to
compose a structure of agency?  Shall we say that even if the writer does not
want the reader to do this, readers will want to anyway?

It seems the prosody of hypertext needs new terminology.  I am comfortable
with the terms syllable/word/measure/lexia, but up from there the familiar
terminology breaks down completely.

5.  Multiplicity of Agency

There are clearly multiple concurrent agencies in a multiuser hypertext that
is being used by several users at once.  An interesting rhetorical question
arises from this:  do we need to discuss multiplicity of agency in the
context of a single reader reading a single hypertext?  Put differently this
is the question:  How does a single mind apprehend a network?  Must one
simulate multiple concurrent agencies in one's own mind?  (It is interesting
to note in this regard that some theorists of mind -- notably Dennett -- have
proposed that despite the illusion that the mind is a singular stream of
agency, in fact the mind *is* a multiplicity of concurrent agencies.)

Many in the hypertext community will surely object that in this whole
discussion so far, I have spoken as if reader and writer are different people
-- i.e. the hypertext is "closed".  It seems reasonable to me to entertain
the idea that writing and reading are *separate agencies* even if done by the
same person in a single session.  Writing-as-reading simply becomes yet
another dimension to the structure of agency.

Concluding Question:

How do we -- or do we at all -- *code* the hypertext for the structure of
agency?

Tony Green's comments on this seem to me right on & are in some ways

he must also hear what the absence of himself would mean
to another. . . . The reader is implicated in the structure of the writer's
displacement, and the effaced intentions of the work are the reader being

with the rather buddhist take on Wittgenstein-- "The world is everything that

Re: Hank Lazer's question about teaching Zukofsky.

I taught Zukofsky recently in a ten-week (quarter) course--short
space!--where we read about 8 poets.  I didn't have more than 2 weeks for
Zuk either.  We read ALL and then (xeroxed) just portions of "'A'" and at
least that whetted their appetite and many of the students (incl. Susan
Vandenborg, Ming-Quian Ma) went on to work on Zukofsky.  The short poems
in ALL are really challenging for them.

As for reading aloud, yes,--but I am the one who does most of the
reading.  And as to tapes:  I don't like to use class time (so limited)
to listen but try to get the students to do so.  Or attend the readings
in the Bay area (since Stanford offers so little).

re charles alexander's post about teaching poetry/reading it aloud; while i do
have students read poems aloud in class, i also make undergrads attend at least
one poetry event of their choosing during the course of the quarter.  for many,
it's the first time they've ever done such a thing, and it seems to have an
impact that reading a poem aloud in a classroom doesn't have.  it shows them the
degree to which poetry is embodied not only in "voice" or sound, but in a social
atmosphere/context, in a particular voice and sound, in a particular body, in
the interaction between voice/presence of reader and audience, setting (bar or
lecture hall or bookstore, etc).  i also show videos.  having a great time in

Hello Burt, David et al:

Medbh (pronounced maeve) McGuckian and Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill (she
pronounces that something like Noola Nee Gonal... my apologies for the
awful phonetics here) are friends but very different poets currently
writing in Ireland-- Nuala in Dublin and Medbh in Belfast (I think) when not
seaside. Nuala writes in Irish-- she discusses that in a January 8 1995
piece in the NYTimes BookReview-- and her stuff is usually presented
bilingually; she has a selected poems called SELECTED POEMS: ROGHA DANTA
(tr. Michael Harnett, from Raven Arts Press).  Medbh's last book is
called CAPTAIN LAVENDER-- but I think her best so far is MARCONI'S COTTAGE.

My friend Laura O'Connor is writing about the colonial tensions animating
Yeats's poems and she helped me hear the same in Nuala's stuff-- it's not
hard, what with strategic leavings of certain words in English (there is
no Irish for 'Black &Decker'...) When David Kellogg said they were
writing against a context of American lit theory, postcolonial theory was
all I could think of as relevent, though the wisdom is flowing east to
west there and not vice versa.

I would rather be reading a poem by each *out loud* than trying to explain
for instance the sexual, abstract ceremonies of metaphor constituting Medbh's
poems, the tough/ready mythic acoustics in Nuala's.

Neither is quite the Iowa poet (Chris?!) that Eavan Boland's become,
though I like her work too (in small doses)

Bye----

Thanks for the great post, Hank Lazar... the remarks teaching from
'unknowing' remind me strongly of an article by Barbara Johnson in the
Yale French Studies pedagogy issue, where she uses the RIME OF THE
ANCIENT MARINER to articulate a productive pedagogy of... gapsmanship
(sorry!! it's been years).  You might enjoy it.

In what we each know, we're unequal, but in the face of the vastness of
what we don't we're properly equal

For all that I know I was squeamish about issues of power and
'discipline' when I began to teach, but sometimes I think in all
seriousness that students need to feel they're experiencing 'training'
(to see "with" before seeing "through" the pretenses entailed in teaching
as a managed activity)

In other words, Vicki Hearne, not Yale French Studies!

Flame on!!  I care too much about the subject to be shy here.

As well as going to poetry readings, a great hit and a joy for all is
bringing real honest to live poets to class and just let them do what
they want to do for however long.  Most of my students hadn't been aware
that there were local poets who write about local issues in local
voices.  A tremendous poet and very emotional in her reading, Mahealani
Kamauu, had us all crying.  She works with a lot of Native Hawaiian
prisoners.  I don't think my stduents had realized that poetry is
actually written by people who breathe and cry.  One of the people I
asked to come was the same age as my students.

I completely agree about the teaching what we don't know.  I used to be
frightened by how much I don't know but now see it as whta makes the
class come alive.  Of course all this backed by everything I do
know--just because I've lived so much longer than most of teh people I'm
teaching.

I teach a different course every semester that I teach, and always
put on books that I have never taught before, and always at least one
that I have not read. One of the best courses was one I gave in 20thC
stuff in Montreal years ago; it was ALL made of texts I didnt know,
and I let this be known when the course started, and I guess there
were some students who thought I was conning them. Started with
Joyce's _Exiles_ and went from there. We all learned a lot that term.

I wish the old Grossman "A" 22-23 was still available. That would have
been the perfect teaching text for LZ (it's perhaps the best poetry he
ever wrote as well).

I had a great experience a year ago at Naropa working hard with the
students to define the core values of their own writing processes
(first a discussion of "how do you write" then one of "how do you
really write" that went into pen vs. computer, kind of paper, time of
day, location, whether other people were around, etc, etc, then had
them all write a single word on a 3x5 card of what, once you removed
all else, was the single thing you would find in their poems (my
favorite answer was "pivot"). Then I had them do work that left that
out (and which violated all the terms of their methodologies).

Teach what you don't know is a pretty good program
Write what you don't know is likewise

Addendum  to Jim Rosenberg's long posting. Esp re Duncan's point of a
sound setting the reader up not to hear it.

I dunno, about 30 some years ago Duncan was speaking of a "scale of
resemblances, which is the story of whole rime. That is the poet is
uring what he can do with rime when he makes thinghs slound similar,
or somewhat similar or not similar at all, so:

Subject:      doing the one-two writing/teaching

Two questions lately posed to this list seem inextricably intertwined: That of
"whence writing comes" [an apparent mystery] & that of "how to teach from
ignorance" [an apparent absurdity].  To begin with the second, by way of
implicitly talking of the first, Marx comes in handy.  In "Contribution to
Critique," he configures a certain kind of critic, one who "PRACTICALLY
interests a large party" by not "confronting the world dogmatically with a new
principle: 'Here is the Truth, kneel before it," but instead by "developing new
principles for the world out of principles of the world."

[when writing, this world is writing.  and despite the language, this need not
be a tauntology.  and, by the by, experience finds its way in both these
worlds, too]

When teaching, I also find that what I have least mastered is precisely that
which comes in most handy.  I especially like taking the transparent,
ignorable, everyday as the place to most incite suspicion, or critique.  And by
using everyday materials (e.g. pop culture), it is most easy to interest a
large party, one as conflictually heterogeneous as possible.

Teaching [writing] is an extreme battle over the modes of cultural recognition,
and as such, marks "humanity's" very problematic, and entangled, relation to
temporality.  As Walter Benjamin remarks in _One Way Street_:

"The mastery of nature, so imperialists teach, is the purpose of all
technology.  But who would trust a cane-wielder who proclaimed the mastery of
children to be the purpose of education? Is not education above all the
indespensible ordering of the relationship between generations and therefore
mastery, if we are to use that term, of that relationship and not of children?
and likewise technology is not the mastery of nature but of the relation of
nature and man."

The subject of mastery, that upon which it WORKS, is not isolated to those
 "natures" supposedly distinct from "man" (or, metaphorically,
the student).  The subject of mastery is in fact the recognition (or
non-recognition) of the irreparably entangled, and mutually constituting,
relation between both.  Thus, pedagogy's site of control and co-ordination,
that upon which its power is exerted, is not that which it ostensibly
addresses--students--but instead generational recognition itself--the
continuity and contiguity of what is recognized as "man."  In the cane-weilding
case, mastery is "man's" attempt to (re)member "himself" as self-same, as
owning or possessing what is seen as "his" "nature."  The drive to order is a
drive both to map a field of recognition and a drive to mask
 the interlocked relations of these multifarious natures.
Paradoxically, or perhaps not too surprisingly, this supposed mastery steps in
precisely where these relations are beyond a controllable play of recognition.

[and I would add: the word "soul" is a dangerous way to step in precisely where
the relations of sender/addressee, me/I, spirit/text are beyond a controllable
play of recognition, that in fact to designate them as such, is to suture what
is essentially problematic & conflictual about these relations, and to likewise
suture the "drive to writing" itself]

Guess what, kids?  It doesn't even have to be "great" writing.  Have
          you heard the new San Diego Padres slogan (since they gutted
          the team of "great" players?): "Hey, it's baseball."  Well,
          "Hey, it's writing!"  A kid is a kid is a kid.  A kid who
          kids is a kidder.  A kid who writes is a writer.  I worked
          with a whole classroom of 8 and 9 year old writers this past
          school year.  I agree with Jordan, the set of poets includes
          the subset of ANYONE who writes poetry. And, beyond that,
          anyone who writes knows something about the writing process
          and can contribute to the dialogue. Even people who are "not
          qualified," such as kids.

yay.  this is what i like to see on the list.  i've started, since my visit to
albany for a conference i found very exciting but nonetheless felt like an
outsider at, to feel somewhat embarrassed about my populist orientations vis a
vis poetry --like a yahoo or something, or a cheap "culti-multuralist" (to crib
from fusco and gomez-pena) which isn't where i think i'm coming from.

another question i've been wanting to put to listers for a while now: what wd
happen if we took seriously robert duncan't dictum that "there is no good or bad

"Can we say soul here?", asked Ryan Knighton in one of his poems.
It's a good question because it makes people effulgent, or they
cringe. Some people can, and some people can't, talk about it without
blushing, or making apologies for saying it.
Isn't the soul one of the organs of experience itself, like the
intellect and the body? There are (at least) five senses belonging to
the body, all of which are wired simultaneously to intellect and
soul, which are wired to each other, and the whole damn system hums
and the humming is poetry.

Hello, all--

As many of you know from my posts, I am studying for my comps right now,
and as many of you also know from a very recent post, I am currently
reading MHAbrams _The Mirror and the Lamp_ (almost done!).  While I
certainly cannot accept TMATL as a manifesto--and indeed don't think it
was intended to be--it is a great little book in that is concisely and
coherently brings together ALL of 19th C. poetics.
My question: Do any of you out there know of a book that does this for
20th C. poetics?  I find myself making suibstantial marginalia "cf pomo",
but it would be so nice if I had a "source book" of the 20th C. to
quickly refer to!

Thanks in advance,

Dear Hank Lazer:

When I had the chance to teach Zuk, I found it fascinating to teach
"Poem Beginning 'The'" as a kind of Jewish, leftist, American anti-
"Waste Land" (which seems to be pretty much how Zuk thought of it).
Now I say *I* found it fascinating, but I'm not sure I really had
enough to time to both introduce my beginning students to Eliot and
provide a way into Zuk's equally dense and unfamiliar poem.  It
would probably take several weeks to do this right.  And oh yes,
I also taught Martin Rowson's clever and hilarious graphical (i.e.
sophisticated comic book) "Waste Land," which crosses Eliot with
Raymond Chandler (so that Christopher Marlowe goes in search of
answers to Eliotic conundrums).  I got a surprising, or not so
surprising, resistance from many of the students to the very idea
of parodying the Waste Land.  Even though they didn't know the
poem, they knew of it, were ready for a serious dose of High
Culture, and were rather offended when the course didn't present
Eliot in those terms.  As you acknowledge elsewhere in your post,
students are often heavily invested in you, the teacher, having the
answers.  Perhaps even more, they want Literature to have the
answers, and want you to "channel" them--the teacher as direct
pipeline to the mysteries of Culture.

The Stein anecdote gives a delightful take on all this.  I also
taught "Lifting Belly" to that same class.  It seems to me an
interesting exercise to ask students to imagine Stein or Zuk as
occupying that modernist cultural "center" ususally given over to
Eliot--still interesting even if your intent is not really to
propose any one new centering.

As I said, tho, I'm not sure how good a job i really did with
"The," and i haven't yet had a chance to try it again.  My most
successful Zukofskyan teaching venture, then, has probably been
using "Mantis," and "'Mantis': An Interpretation."  The sestina
form provides a recognizable way into Zuk's habitual mental and
linguistic "torsion," the clarity of the actual physical encounter
and the poem's moral imperatives shine through its difficulties,
and comparing the original poem with its poetic "interpretation"
provides useful grounds for talking about what makes a poem a poem
anyway.

Hope this helps,
steve shoemaker

PS.

I hope you'll either post your results or back-channel me when you
teach Zuk in the fall.

Yes! Leave it to Lorine. I think this woman INVENTED the space between words.

But which better expresses her silence: reading the poem aloud so as to
'hear' the silences, defined by the sounds of the words; or to not read
the poem aloud at all?

Admittedly her poems are musical and thus demand to be spoken; but on the
other hand, when I read poems I 'hear' the voice in my head, perfectly.

What is silence anyway? Is it merely lack of sound?

maria, your question brought to mind earlier comments on duchamp
and chance a while back. duchamp said something similar re good art and
bad art: it's still art. in regrads to duncan, i love what he says abt
seeing himself as a derivative poet, abt writing and adding to the
tradition. one long, long poem.

Funny that on three lists I'm on at the moment there are or have recently
been discussions of what happens to children in this society.  Is the

   dear md---what would happen if took seriously duncan's dictim may be
   actually what happens now, depending on who the "we" is (no doubt)
   --that people would read poetry that moves them and poetry that doesn't,
   that they wouldn't know what moves them until they read it,
   and perhaps all poetry (even if we take the widest possible sense of
   it) moves one--but to disgust sometimes. And if a poem moves one to
   disgust, need we call it bad--not necessarily if it's what one needs--
   and so all these notions of "interpretive communities" does not work
   for a lot of people. Perhaps no two are alike--for, in the abstract,
   we may all "marry" "high culture" and "low culture" in various, conflicting
   ways--yet, even if we all decided to call ourselves "populists" there'd
   no doubt be disagreements about the virtues of WHICH "low art" we find
   ourselves more drawn to--and most likely disagree with ourselves--
   "Why did I like THAT in 1987?" etc.
   And, it's only if we inflexibly and dogmatically claim a certain
   definite zone, draw a certain line in the sand (and I'm not saying that
   I don't find myself doing that provisionally for "academic career reasons"

   a "real need"--Or should I say "feel" instead of "believe"), that
   terms like "good" and "bad" matter. I am a GOOD person. I am married
   to a GOOD person but a have a BAD job. Rejecting the terms "good"
   and "bad" (if not "evil") may be something aspires to, and may be the
   the "ideal condition" good and bad lurk behind, playing dead. But
   when you are drowning in the ocean a shark is definitely "bad" and
   a liferaft "good" (unless, of course....) Chris

And isn't the fact that it's all so natural one of the reasons we
don't value such things very much? They've got to grow up, go to school and
have all that natural ability pounded out of them and then earn it back
inch by inch. That's when appreciation of their efforts really begins.

good point.  So how do I know if you and I are talking about the same thing
when we're using the word "hearing"?  At what point can we make the
epistemological "call" and assume we're communicating?

The inner voice, partly recognizable as my own and partly other (I've never
been quite able to put my finger on it), is speaking a language more musical
than linguistic (although that aspect is there too); no matter what language
I read in, every text has its own unique "accent".

Hear hear!  Many people have an acquired aversion to talking about soul and
spirit because organized religions hijacked the words and have been abusing
them for centuries.  And religion's replacements, science and money, don't
want anything to do with such notions because discussion along spiritual
lines points up the poverty of science and money with regard to the soul.

Much more.  Silence is the source of sound.  Sound arises from silence.  It

Shaunanne posted looking for a sourcebook of 20th century poetics.

There should be such a book, or attempt at one, but I don't think there is.
I'd be interested to hear from folks on the list re what should be in such a
book. Or even what it might begin with-- Dickinson letters? Rimbaud letters?
(not 20th c. but...) Pounds "A Retrospect"?

The Donald Allen & Warren Tallman book _The Poetics of the New American
Poetry_ (which is not available though Grove reannounced it few years ago
they never put it back out)
is a good collection though of course not up to date. Published in 1973 it
includes only 3 women-- Lenore Kandel, Levertov, & Stein. It begins with
Whitman (to Emerson), then Fenollosa, then Pound. Less historical breadth but
worth mentioning-- Waldman's _Disembodied Poetics_ , _The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
Book_, there's something called _Conversant Essays_ Wayne State put out a
couple years ago, ranges across the
current field pretty well, tho I don't  think
ethnopoetics or nuyoricans get a hearing, but
"confessionals" & new formalists (not a
very good term huh) alongside Sir Silliman
(one of his best essays I think-- "'Postmodernism':
Sign for a Struggle, Struggle for a Sign"),
I believe Bernstein, Retallack, et al.
 Anthologies of poetics anyone?

The Allen/Tallman book also of note for
inclusion of materials from Spicer's Vancouver
lectures.

Thinking more about the business of deciding to teach a book one has
not read much, I remember that when I was a graduate student and a
bunch of topics were suggested, I would always take the one I knew
least about. It made for learning instead of whatever we do with our
favourite things. Simil;ar process when teaching a book: you have to
learn something, and who wants to keep on teaching what he knows?

Gary Geddes edited an anthology called _20th Century Poetry & Poetics_
which was published by Oxford University Press (Canadian Division) in
1973.  It has a large selection of essays on poetics by poets as diverse
as Auden, Pound, Stevens, Williams, Yeats, Creeley, Al Purdy, Robert Graves,
Olson, Syvia Plath and Gary Snyder.

"soul" equals a word, that in my experience, often with a false glee, patches
over the decenteredness that centers all "passionate" activity (which I, or
Freud, or whoever before him called "drive," or Lacan who configures it as a
metonymically skating-figure eight, incited by and "circling" a vacuum, an
impossible/Real space between which there is a demand for a home, or placement,
... a resting)

e.g. "the soul of the nation"
gives a truncate to the very impossiblity of there being a uniform, embodied
nation people in the first place, the "passion" of patriotism is a "soul"-like
covering-over of the dis-ease of there never being possible an addressible
"people" as such (i've stolen this argument from claude lafort,
 _Democracy & Political Theory_)

e.g. "the soul of the lover/beloved"

But, this, I think needs no explaining..., the experience of the veiled
bullshit involved here is at-hand daily, and romantic comedies are a sure-
fire way to fill in this hole

(with the largest laugh of all, being able to --in the last and climatically--
stuff it in her)

(isn't it possible that the populace's supposed beloved, Hugh Grant, solicited
& fucked the whore less because of what she offered than to--in a truly
heroic, perhaps revolutionary way--displace his name from "he, King of Romance"
to "he, exposer of the traumatic, comedic root of Romance veiled by romancing"
and in so doing, risk sacrificing the celebrity right/rite of possesing and
gaining interest (money, otherwise) from his name/signature in the body
politic?  Although perhaps "cynical" love-wise, I should think this reading
nonetheless offers the utmost pleasure)

e.g., and finally, "the soul which inspires writing"

leave it to say, it takes no genius to figure out that everyone is always
talking far too loudly and writing non-stop, only some like to package, and
pass this on as "genuis" whereas others just keep mouthing on, in their own way

(cf. any of the talk shows which best get your gun, or to be less oral-biased,
the massive amount of "first-novels" from which I can make money editing)


and by the by, isn't e-space the ideal vent for all these vast verbal highways,
as a very convienent by-way from the world in its so sublime splitting?

yet what happens in this particular split, and perhaps all of them, is
something uniquely political,
and as such, e-space is the true seat of the "new" politics,
one that may both sit on its ass, or
get quite a many asses moving

I have no children, but a friend of mine used to play a metaphor game with
his son, who is slightly autistic.  He explained the concept of
comparison, and how many ordinary designations have metaphorical roots
(e.g., hands of a clock -- cf., of course, Nietzsche).  The boy would make
up all sorts of wonderful and 'ridiculous' metaphors for objects, people,
faces, events.

One day he looked at some stone steps that were covered in glittering
moonlit ice (they lived in Alaska and there had apparently been a thaw
followed by a freeze), pointed, and said "flight of stairs."  My friend
had NO idea if he had heard this expression before, but he's now convinced
himself that "Flight of stairs" originated in such a moment.

He later noted that his son's ability to create novel metaphor began to
disappear the day he entered school.

Likewise, I'm sure. Or, I'm not sure who it'll "screw" up. Do you feel
screwed up by exclaiming you're a poet?

to one relation, and that it's conferred from outside, by praise. If someone
says "I like that poem" to a child (what's with the word "kid" anyway?) that
mark of respect will turn them into a poet. And they'll be stuck like the
rest of us. I suspect identity is a little more flexible. A child who can
think of herself as a giant clam or as some snow, "a stretched cat on a wide
branch," may think of herself for a few seconds as a poet, or as a violinist
writing poetry, or as tough, or shy, or as not worth listening to.

Maybe that isn't the problem. Maybe you're W.C. Fields. That's fine. But I
think you're recapitulating what Charles Alexander posted about--the need to
exclude certain kinds of poetic production from the domain of poetry. Which,
as he rightly suggested, is the wrong thing to do. If, instead, you want to
talk about quality, I'll read all your posts.

Subject:      Correction RE: where it comes from

        Oops--
        Some days ago I posted a diagram purporting to illustrate a thing
that can and does go wrong in the relating of where "it" comes from,
but I attributed the schema, via wild guess, to the wrong guy.  Not
Macherey's style to posit a structure so undialectical; it really comes
from Jurij Lotman as construed (and no doubt skewed) by me.
        It came to me that night in bed beside my fishing and camping
catalogs, my _Roadside Geology of New York_, and my Proust and H James with
their looping, soporific (in the good sense) sentences; but, because I've been
singlehandedly looking after one 4-yr-old nephew (who may or may not be
properly labeled a poet but certainly makes a crack amateur ethicist), I
haven't found time to post this correction until now.
        As I say, it was meant to schematize something that happens, not to
explain the whole writing situation.  Ron Silliman zeroes in on an important
problem with it--that it looks cooked-up as job security for professional
explainers--but, fortunately or not, that's not a refutation.
        I'd love to see it redesigned according to Tony Green's specs,
but wouldn't it take an Escher or a Magritte to draw that out?  Ceci n'est
pas un conceptual schema?  One can only hope. . . .

A friend and I have been discussing this topic of child poets as well.
We came up with the conclusion that the child has no concept of being a
poet or an "artist", that is something we label them with and place on
their heads.  I think the pure fact that they are unaware of themselves
as "being" anything but a child expresses the purity of their actions.  I
agree with George that the "self" is a learned state of being, but I
don't think we can discard the creative efforts of children as merely
pretty pictures and charming rhymes.
         There is a sophistication in the lack of trained technical
expression.  The child may begin without direction but experimenting
within a medium eventually leads to a theory and a goal.  Children develop
their own patterns and aesthetic values which is why they have favorite
stories and teddy bears, etc .  Have you ever watched kids finger
painting?  They do have an idea of what they are trying to produce, but
they haven't learned the skill to translate the visions within their heads
to the paper in a form that can be interpreted by others.
        Poetry may be slightly different as children are bombarded by
language while still in the womb, while visual concepts develop later,
sound is always present.  Who's to say that that alone is not the
beginning of a poetic license

I think George wasn't objecting so much to the praising of children (in fact
he gave some in the first line), but rather, under the guise of praise, to
impose a label that the kid is then supposed to adopt as an identity and
live up to.  This can and does lead to neurosis, even in us adults.  I know
I don't want to "be a poet", I just want to write.  But I didn't aways feel
this way, and I used to be quite a nervous child until I decided it was OK
just to want to be, without predicating that being on something else.  Not
that I've succeeded in that task, mind you...

I'm back from the road with my two-bits.
I agree with George: children aare children. The attraction to
childhood as an artistic state bewilders me. It seems, among other
reasons, that it's the lack of control and discipline we, as adults,
admire and want to defend. Picasso sd something to the effect
that it took him a lifetime to learn how to paint like a child.
Or, unlearn, I guess. The process contradicts its destination.
It is still painting _like_ a child, out of a definition of "children's
painting". I find this issue alive in aleatoric comp., as well
as in Pablo's pictures. My drawings and storys, as a pre-tad,
didn't have this struggle. I guess my point is that trying
to develop a means to a child's perceptions is more the issue
than children's perceptions.

I'm not sure if this is what started this subject, or if it has
already been a part of it, but what does it mean to teach a book?
As an undergrad, oh so many months back, a book arrived in class,
occurred, became books, and we spent the rest of the semester, as
a group of individuals, trying to become a class with a book.
The book that arrived was not the one that left, usually. Sometimes
two or three or more left. Profs who played show and tell offered.
Those who engaged in the above process taught. They recognized it
as agonistic.

It's interesting this message arrives as I'm flipping
through various anthologies etc. feeling I have to call very
soon with my decision abt what books to assign for a
workshop I'll be teaching.

But isn't it a matter of how the book is used? I mean is
it possible, really, to approach teaching a book with
the understanding that it will be a different book for each
person? It may be hopeless. Yet a book can offer a basis, a context from
which to proceed. Cage left college after a
few years because he didn't understand why everyone
should read the same book. Certainly that was the
right decision for him. Maybe I'll assign Silence,
but whether to make them pay $16.95 for it. . .

Another interesting book on modern poetics (or at least poetic form,
the concrete manifestation of poetics) is Donald Wesling's *The New
Poetries*. Interestingly, he treats the whole run since 1798 (*Lyrical
Ballads*) as of a piece, rather than proposing differences organized
around "centuries".

Yes for poets, writers, or artists, disregarding age. We had to fill out a
grant application at Minn. Center for Book Arts, and one question had to do
with number of artists participating in our projects. One of our
exhibitions this year is a children's book art exhibition, and one staff
members wanted to exclude the children from being counted as artists. I
think that is NOT a good idea.

I like the emphasis that Ed gives  -  you don't teach a book you teach yourself

Arguably the processes of engagement with producing of a book are
them-selves forms of teaching the book though?

So, I'd ask the question again  -  which books that have YET to be written
would you teach?

I was hoping that responses might reveal hopes and ambitions for both
poetry and the book and therefore inevitably some optimism for
'yourselve[s]' and some marker space-cadet projects to fuel discussion -
maybe action.

Subject:      20th century poetics and child poetry

Just to connect some themes:

Does anyone else feel there's an interesting use of child-like language,
also beginner's guide to grammar type language, in modern poets like
Robert Grenier (in Sentences) or Lyn Hejinian (in My Life) or Carla
Harryman (especially in In The Mode Of), or Leslie Scalapino's early
work with its feel of lullaby and nonsense poetry quote unquote, or
Bruce Andrews' Wobbling, or Bernadette Mayer's Studying Hunger;
can this be just put down to the spirit of play, or camp? It seems
to me to be a vital distinction between some Language Writing and,
on the one hand, fifties and sixties Concrete Poetry, on the other
hand, the always urbane Ashbery? That there is a kind of defiant,
politicised, fascinating use of child-like language, that only a
forceful radical group could do, to make potentially hostile readers
frightened of it, so that it doesn't just get dismissed as childish?
Don't children also get dismissed as childish when they want to
include something normally excluded? Isn't Carla Harryman's work
in particular interested in using Language Writing "idiom" ( or
labelling or identification of her as a Language Writer) to open
up this very area of children not having the power to make people
frightened, as the Language Writers could? Isn't Harryman locating
childlikeness and play as not merely jouissance and pleasure, but
in fact a mode of intuitive purer vulnerabe being unjustly
brutalised? So that Language Writing becomes figured as not a
departure from, reaction to, but a return to, a reclaiming from?

Just some questions...

Maybe not REQUIRED, but I think students should be encouraged to write in
any poetry class. Trying to write the stuff may make poetry more alive
for them. It'll make them more interested and maybe more interestING too.
Also, you never know, there might be a beaten-down discouraged kid in the
class for whom a nudge to write poetry would open a world. (When I say
"kid" I don't mean "child" in relation to the other argument going
around.) (Or do I?)

George, Ryan, I'm sorry if anybody hurt you by praising you.

For an Apted-like review of the lives of the children Kenneth Koch praised

you'll be happy to know that he feels that the praise Koch gave him was
bewildering, and that he gave up writing poems soon after. And _I'll_ be
happy to tell you that Morley grew up to be an editor at the Washington Post,
and a reporter and essayist whose work has been in the Village Voice, The
Nation.

Here, by the way, is his poem:

THE DAWN OF ME

I was born nowhere
And I live in a tree
I never leave my tree
It is very crowded
I am stacked up right against a bird
But I won't leave my tree
Everything is dark
No light!
I hear the bird sing
I wish I could sing
My eyes, they open
And all around my house
The Sea
Slowly I get down in the water
The cool blue water
Oh and the space
I laugh swim and cry for joy
This is my home
  For Ever

I am with Charles Alexander that it is NOT a good idea not to count children as
artists.

What can we do to combat grownupism* (both individual and institutional)?

*the irrational belief that children are intellectually & emotionally
inferior to grownups.
                             ---0---

Some children are good poets and some are not. But I include the good & the bad in
the anthology I make up at the end of each workshop (this is every year, in an
urban public school where many of the students are classified as "at risk").

I have noticed that grownup anthologies do not exclude the bad either (& some
of the bad poets were never "at risk").

Anybody out there interested in the translatability of sound symbolism?

1.el murmullo de abejas innumerables works in Spanish as well as the murmuring of
innumerable bees does in English but what do you have to do if you are
translating into a language that shares nothing with yours?

2. Here is a different (and perhaps more interesting) issue:
If every poem is a bundle of symbols (and indices and
icons) on the phonological plane, how much of this bundle appears in a "normal"
translation, one that is not aiming consciously at preserving sound?

[noP;o+s%q      R?FG6"zf74Sa]Eo[;zM'<iyAnd do you get a lot of that blundle if you are aiming consciously, as in
what Zukofsky did with Catullus?)

i don't know about "should," but i often ask, at the beginning of a class, that
students write quickly, for example, a "frank o'hara" poem. they usually like
that. o'hara's perfect, of course, because he did compose off-the-cuff, but i've
tried it w/ others as well, and often, for undergrads, i ask them to keep a
reading journal in which they are required, sometimes, to imitate the author
being studied.  i was surprised at, for example, how well this worked with lyn
hejinian's my life.  students who thought the work cryptic suddenly fell in love
with it and with themselves writing and remembering.

i agree w/ charles and with others who think it's okay for kids to be considered
paraticipants in creative activity, whether you want to label them as "poets" or
not --i think that latter consideration is contextual --there are times when
it's important, as in charles's example, to be advocates for children as
artists, and then it's also at other times important to avoid labels that create
anxiety about performance and adult expectations of kids.  charles, your post
reminds me of something i heard on the radio, about a nine-year-old girl who had
invented a board game, or something like that, that threatened a major
corporation because (i may be getting the details wrong) she used one of their
advertizing slogans.  or maybe it was the other way around, they cribbed for one
of their slogans a phrase that came from a board game she'd invented and
marketed.  anyway, the fascinating and salient thing about their argument, which
became a lawsuit, was that the corporation argued that because of her age she
was too young to have a right to claim intellectual property.  or whatever--her
age became the disqualifying criterion. this seems to me to be a clear example
of discrimination against creative children as children -- a form of
discrimination i believe most people on this list find objectionable --not to
hegemonize or colonize the nature of the list's participants --i guess i mean i
hope most people on the list would recognize this as blatant discrimination.

This is wonderful.  I'm definitely going to leave a book unread in the
fall.  I do usually leave what I'm going to say unthought until I'm right
there.  This surprises my students and leaves room for lots of confusion
and enthusiasm from every quarter.

Ira,

you're suggesting that Language poetry is like language acquisition
by children, the way they come to inhabit and manipulate discourse
forms?

i acquired this aversion after abandoning the family religion, realizing
these words didnt mean, signify, anything to me.  it's one of the reasons
i hate translating "animus" in latin class.  i still cannot
find anything in these words that does not bring back the ol' immaterialism,
irrationalism...  what i find is the poverty of the soul with regard to
science.

 so i'd like to know, then, what did soul and spirit
mean before they were "hijacked" and "abused"?  was there a before, or
merely our projection in order to gain ancient authority?

maybe I'M reading "soul" too religiously--but i'm afraid to use it otherwise,
expand it, to apply it to something mysterious that was once concrete (or
definable, at least, if not material) b/c this is the history of the word
god.  --brian

In response to Brian's message of July 14:  I'm not sure of the exact etymology
 of the word "soul," and I'm too lazy to go out in this 97 degree heat to find
 out, but the word has certainly "branched out," so to speak.  What about music
 having "soul"?  Rhythm, depth from within, and so on. . .

For what it's worth, I first heard about a lot of the writing I'm now
reading (such as Clark Coolidge, Ron Silliman, P. Inman)
(I was already reading Cage and Mac Low)  from
stumbling across Marjorie Perloff's "Radical Artifice: Writing Poetry

been recommending it to people ever since. I *think* it's still in

Gabrielle Welford wrote: "Did Oppen read Wittgenstein?"

My impression is that Oppen was more affected by Heidegger & checking the
Selected Letters that seems to be confirmed. Wittgenstein is cited a number
of times, often in connection with Zukofsky, he even refers to Zukofsky as
"playacting Wittgenstein" and refers to _Bottom_ as "replete with
Wittgenstein". However there's an interesting reply to a letter from Duncan
in '75 in which he says "You were saying the recent poems are
incomprehensible   ?   I don't really think so. And was not thinking of that
which cannot be said in language-- of that indeed silent however unwillingly.
I was confused by the entry of Wittgenstein--". Apparently Duncan found the
recent work which wld've been _Seascape: Needle's Eye_ & I guess, _Myth of
the Blaze_ (which I think is his best, that work has been very important to
me personally), "incomprehensible" but mentioned Wittgenstein which seems to
me astute. It sounds, however that he was thinking of the _Tractatus_, but I
think the later Wittgenstein more accurate. In a footnote Oppen says "But I
thought that I was simply pointing to things. . ." & I think he was, & I
think you were when you made that connection. There may be others on the list
who know more about this Witt/Op/Dun thing?

Just a bit of information on this, Harryman's _the Words_ (part of which has

Shapiro's done a lot of great work with kids, maybe he inspired Padgett? so

Thank you, Joseph Zitt, for the nice plug.  RADICAL ARTIFICE is indeed in
print --in fact in paperback, out a few months ago, should be readily
available @$16.95.  And Dance of the Intellect is being reissued by North-
western which did Poetics of Indterminacy and which is doing Hank Lazer's
new collection as well as Bruce Andrews's essays.  Northwestern has an
enlightened editor of the new avant-garde series named Rainer Rumold, dept
of German & comp lit, as well as Susan Harris, editor, who is terrific.
They will be putting out some interesting things.

A query: does anyone know anything about the English poet Glyn Maxwell?
He is the guy who wrote the snidest review I've ever seen of Bernstein,
Linda Reinfeld, Anthony Easthope, Steve McCaffery etc. for Times Lit
Supplement --mixing these people in with Larkin etc. in a meaningless
hodgepodge.  What are Maxwell's own poems like?  I've only seen one or
two but gather in England he's very much "admired" by the Establishment.

I ask because I am doing a talk on the relation of literary journalism (is
there any?) and lit crit and am planning to say, among other things, that
this Buffalo net contains more useful material than the "lit journalism"
outlets, at least so far as poetry is concerned.  But it wasn't always so:
have been reading very old New York Times Book Reviews and in 1904 or so
there were actually good long reviews of Paul Dunbar among others!

Regarding use of the word "soul", I agree with Brian:

>i still cannot
>find anything in these words that does not bring back the ol' immaterialism,
>irrationalism...

Words like "soul" and "spirit" seem to be too weighed down with mystical
baggage to be useful in any other context, such as discussing whether poetry
comes from one's "soul" or "experience". A human personality is shaped by what
one experiences through one's senses, perhaps by physical actions upon the
brain, and by one's genetic material. To say that poetry can come from one's
"soul" without experience is nonsensical - in order to write a poem, one must
have language, which implies the experience of learning that language, which
inevitably shapes the poem.

I'd contend that, rather than "point[ing] up the poverty of science ... with
regard to the soul", "discussion along spiritual lines" shows itself as vapid
and superfluous, lacking in explanatory value. That is, if you take "soul" and
"spirit" to signify some essence of the self that can exist independently of
a material body. If, however, you take it to mean that "part" or "faculty" of
our mental processes that "feels" rather than thinks, then some phrase such as
"the emotions" could substitute for "the soul". This concept is perhaps too
close to the romantic conception of "the heart" for my liking, and phrases such
as "this poem comes from the heart" are all too often a code for "watch out,
tedious uncritical sentimental outburst coming up".

I prefer to use the word "mind". I'm not sure that we can readily make useful
distinctions between the part of us that thinks and the part of us that feels -
thinking and feeling may be part of the same process. What I hope for in poetry
is a tender logic, a rational passion.

        Tom.

Marjorie,
        I bought one of his books ("The Mayor's Son", I think) a year or so
ago, and read it no more than once. I guess that says something about my
impression of his work. From what I remember, it was quite formal (a lot of
end-rhymes) and vaguely satirical. Probably quite clever, but forgettable. I
might be able to look up his book tomorrow to see if that refreshes my memory.

If you want to see a snide review, take a look at Jane Stafford's review of
Michele Leggott and Murray Edmond in NZ Books. Unbelievable.

        Tom Beard.

Ira,

You are right on target with your comments on Carla Harryman's work.
Carla has spoken of P.D. Eastman's Go Dog, Go, as her "most
influential" book, and only half tongue in cheek. In a similar manner,
Margaret Wise Brown (Runaway Bunny, Goodnight Moon) clearly thought
herself influenced by Gertrude Stein (though her sense of the stanza
more often reminds me of the very early Robert Duncan (cf. the old City
Lights edition of the Selected Poems, pre-Opening of the Field).

Me too. At the big Cage exhibit at the Philadelphia Art Museum is a
"compose your own Cage score" computer program, basically a point and
click mouse and computer screen deal, with textual quotes from Cage on
screen, snippets of his works, that of others (Morton Feldman fits very
nicely in), excerpts from interviews, readings, etc. One of my
three-year-old twins got to the mouse and had about a half dozen adults
wearing headphones all nodding in total appreciation for about 10
minutes. His instincts were absolutely equal to the task.

Maxwell is certainly one of a number of 'star' poets currently being built
up by the Brit Lit Establishment. Anybody hear of the 'New Gen' Poets from
'94 - a joint puiblishers and Poetry Society opinion-forming media binge?

Here's a bit of Maxwell, speaking for himself in a selection of 'poetry &
the gulf war' from Poetry Review in '92. He's talked of sometimes as a poet
whose work signals the arrival (read as acceptable manifestation) of
'post-modernism' in British Poetry! He cites Bob Dylan as his major
influence. The Poem's called 'Queen of Mice' and I'll quote a short section
from a 'competition-tailored' 42 odd line length  - I really can't be
bothered to read him or count them that closely, sorry  he's got a vacuous
affected prosody that bores the ^ out of me so much so that I've a appended
a quick remix:-

'... hands in pouches, disabused, in the wind,
nor are they shocked who hurt and putt in the distance,

There is nothing up with the black mice in their normal

Subject:      Leaves from a Book Unbound

Texts generated by active readers of my machine modulated piece, Book
Unbound, can now be read on the world wide web. There are now 'leaves' by
James Waite, myself, Steve Balogh, Jim Rosenberg and Herb Levy. I hope to
receive more from others soon.

To go straight to the leaves, visit:

        http://www.inforamp.net/~cayley/inleaves.html

For more information about the context of this work:

        http://www.inforamp.net/~cayley/inhome.html

A brief blurb on Book Unbound follows:

BOOK UNBOUND
Indra's Net VI

When you open the book unbound, you will change it. New collocations
of phases generated from its hidden given text - a short piece of prose by
the work's  initiator - will be displayed. After the screen fills, you
will be invited to select a phrase from the generated text by clicking
on the first and the last words of a string of language which appeals to
you. Your selections will be collected on the page of this book named
Leaf, where you will be able to copy or edit them as you wish.

They will also become a part of the hidden store of potential collocations
from which the book will go on to generate new text. That is, your
selections will feed back into the process and change it irreversibly.

If you continue reading and selecting over many sessions, your preferred
collocations may eventually come to dominate the process. The work may
then reach a state of chaotic stability, strangely attracted to one
particular modulated reading of its original seed text.

 Yes, but Heidegger was much more important to him.  In letters, he

maybe music has "soul" in the sense that neither, as notes or as a word,
refer to anything but music and "soul."  (as far as music being
"soulful," that's usu. only applied to blues, gospel, and "soul" music
anyway)
        "soul" is the most concrete thing there is, and music is a lot
like concrete poetry.  they can only
derive meaning from their contexts--e.g. when a musical work quotes a line
of Strauss or whoever, when "soul" is used in either religious or poetic
discourse.  music (i mean the kind w/o words) is all play--so a piece of
christian music (say the new romantic Europeans, Part, Gorecki...) is
only christian in that it refers back to the musical tradition of the
church.  This has been a problem for me, justifying my fondness for
certain pieces whose composers I didnt agree with...like people who hate
Orff's music cause of his assoc w/ the Nazis.  there's a book called
TOWARDS A SEMIOTICS OF MUSIC or somthing, i forget the author; anyone
read it, found it useful?  --brian.

So there are untenable meanings (meanings that are given by metaphysical
structures that can be deconstructed) of the word "soul".  So many that the
mention of the word itself makes us cringe.  But why should this be?  Don't
we all as humans have a capacity to undergo experiences that can't be
captured by the physical, can't be captured by the emotional, can't be
captured by the intellectual, inclusive of all these aspects as they may be?
Why not validate such experiences, why not allow a term like "spiritual" to
describe them so we can explore them within language, which is what we have
when we're _not_ undergoing them?  Of course, such a term is not "precise".
Ultimately, what term is?  But vapid?  Superfluous?  Lacking in explanatory
value?  That depends on how wide your focus is of things to try and explain,
beard.  But is it really "explanation" of phenomena that poetry attempts?
Or is it description and an imparting of a special kind of experience of
phenomena?

I do agree that thinking and feeling are quite intertwined, and by the same
token, that body and soul are quite intertwined.  I don't think "soul" is
some "part" that can have a word like "the emotions" pinch-signify for it.
It bears, for me, an uncanny resemblence to the "moving empty center"
Charles Borkhuis describes in an essay in _Antenym_ 7 (due out in August), a
non-essentialist essence.  It is a little piece of absence around which
presence occurs, and toward which it is drawn, kinda like static cling. And
before one early historical soul-jacking during the period of lamentation
literature, it meant "breath".  And if that gives me any authority, I
breathe it all back.

See, you've made plenty of metaphorical hay out of "soul" :-)

But is there anything that derives meaning from something other than
context?  Is there even anything that escapes context so that we could test
this?

Thank you Tom Beard, and thanks, Chris Cheek for those marvelous
messages.  This is where the net really helps, yes?  In the meantime, I
found some of Maxwell's boring poems in the Bloodaxe anthology so I get
the drift.  What's interesting is that these "clever" non-poems can get
attention; it shows what a low opinion the critics have of poetry because
the assumption is that it's enough to make a clever joke or two or one
little pun and you've got a fine poem, right?

On Oppen/Wittgenstein/Heidegger:  I worked on this while writing my
Wittgenstein book and it's complicated because although Oppen thinks he's
more like Heidegger, his use of language is often much closer to
Wittgenstein's treatment of ordinary language.  But not as close as, say,
Creeley is.  Still, "Of Being Numerous," for example, is a rather
Wittgensteinian poem as Burt Hatlen pointed out some time ago.  Or at
least Witt. can help one read Oppen.

Examples?

If you mean such experiences as falling in love, I'd say this was emotional/
physical. If you mean being struck by the beauty of a landscape or a
mathematical proof, I'd say this was emotional/intellectual. If you mean the
frisson that comes from reading or hearing a poem that moves you, I'd say that
this was all three. I don't see a need to use the word "soul" to describe these
experiences.

If, on the other hand, you mean astral travel, visions of God, spoon bending,
ouija boards and suchlike phenomena, then I am not convinced that such things
exist, except as artefacts of the human nervous system. We could get into an
argument about the existence of paranormal phenomena, but this is not the place
for such a discussion.

Well, poetry doesn't usually set itself the goal of explanation, but this topic
arose, not _in_ a poem, but in a discussion _about_ poetry, and whether one's
poetry comes from one's poetry or one's experience. In this context, I still
find the word "soul" useless when trying to explain "where" a poem originates.

Even in "description and an imparting of a special kind of experience of
phenomena", I find the word "soul" fairly useless. Phrases such as "I feel it
in my soul" and "You touched my soul" reek of cheap love songs and greeting-
card sentiment. Go on, tell me _how_ you felt it: a lance through the belly, a
tug in the groin, a small fire at the base of the skull.

This still seems like some kind of perception to me, a mental process. I still
don't see a need for a word like "soul". I have a mind (or perhaps more
precisely, I am a mind), and I have no difficulty seeing myself as a
neurophysical process. I need no ghost in my machine.

Niedecker. I have loved her work for 30 years. I didnt say that she
reminds me of Loy. I never introduced the context of gender. All I
said was that Loy was really good at employing the space around
words, and that one who reads Niedecker might have a look at that
too. Lightman also put quotation marks around the words he attributed
to me. I dont get the point of that at all.

Rod, thanks for the things I didn't know about Duncan too.  And I'd say
_Tractatus_ and later stuff are not as opposed as some people make out.
All the stuff of Investigations is there, especially with that final
appeal to silence and mystery.  How many people on this list besides me
are enraptured Wittgensteinians?  Something about Witt. and what Ira said
about children and language po.  Something about a way of searching for
knowledge that is open ended--completely unHeidegger as David Antin
points out in an interview with Spanos.  Just reading Ron Padgett's piece
in _Talking Poetics_ Vol.I where he says about one kind of poetry:

"Now there's another kind, where you get in the car with a thousand bucks,
and you just start driving down the street and you don't have any idea
where you're going to go.  You come to the corner and you take a left,
right, or straight ahead, unless you want to go backwards, which is a
possibility too.  It's much more interesting, it's more exciting.  Of
course you can end up running out of gas in the middle of the desert--it
involves all sorts of dangers.  But it's wonderful to be able to go to
the typewriter at any given moment; you can wake up in your sleep and
just start writing.  And in fact that's really thrilling.  I mean lots of
times you write absolute baloney that way, real garbage.  But it's
usually more fun, and that's the kind of poetry I prefer writing."

Is this where the politics of lang po comes in?  Or should I say, maybe
this could be where the politics of lang po comes in for me--unlearning
the beaten paths of everything.  Letting language take me instead of me
taking language.  Faith in meaning--Wittgenstein of course.

I am having a problem with Ed Foster's line
"you don't teach books, chris, you teach yourself."

a. does that mean that you teach yourself to students rather than
teaching books? Well, I guess that could be interesting for a short
while, but you might wind up teaching your identity to them instead.

b. or does it mean that you teach yourself stuff? Well, that would
come to an end after a while too, because you would run out of stuff
you know.

I wd rather think that you learn from somewhere. So that if you wind

Speaking of Whorf, I was pretty amazed by the outright savaging of Whorf in
in Steven Pinker's _The Language Instinct_.  I rather liked most of that book,
and I suppose some of his criticisms of Whorf have some bite, but I was
totally taken aback by the vehemence with which Pinker went after Whorf, and
it seems to me that Pinker was guilty of setting up a straw man and then
knocking it down.  Basically, Pinker blasted what I would call "the strong
Whorf hypothesis", that thinking occurs in *nothing but* language.  He didn't
really touch what is much closer to what Whorf was getting at, it seems to me,
that the language one speaks has *an influence* on how one thinks.  I'd be
curious to hear comments from somebody else who's read Pinker's book.

Gabrielle,
Really, it's all there in the _Tractatus_? I'm not _that_ versed in L.W. but
had thought the more contextual understanding of language games etc. comes
after, late 20s? mid '30s?

Re: "unlearning the beaten paths" -- Hejinian has a great statement on that,
"Once one sought a vocabulary for ideas, now one seeks ideas for
vocabularies." Which points to possibilities, that the ideas are already
extant, within language, within contexts (which interpentrate, a context is
always multiple & in the end not defineable, I'm convinced via me Mahayana
reading (i.e. there are always more factors to be taken into account)) it is
the writer's task (& delight) to find them. So self expression finally a
problematic term? Cage used to always say that ideas were "in the air" -- how
else explain more than one inventor coming up with the same idea
thousands of miles apart. One could say, well technology had reached the
point where that idea was possible-- exactly, that idea existed, waiting to
be discovered, "in the air."

Marjorie Perloff has sd that now it is Stein/Wittgenstein whereas for the
last generation in was Heidegger/Pound, I think, or was it Whitehead/Olson.
It's a useful point I think.
Of course it's more multiple than that, but points to something actual I

I would like "to teach" a book that accepts the term "soul", through
and through. Before the mid-17th century it made sense in poetics and
in hermeneutics, because it was the term under which the anagogical
level of interpretation, the relation of God to the Soul, could be
read.

 We don't have that one anymore. Our notions of allegory exclude the
Anagogical. How can we read anything
before 1660?

The rationalisms of the 1660's deleted it and the
Enlightenment wouldn't have it and the Romantics could only be
nostalgic for it.

  Among other questions I'd ask:  Aren't there any Gnostics left in poetry or did they
all die with the Beat movement?

Subject: EZLN: CONSULTA INTERNACIONAL

July 3, 1995
Mexico D.F.

To all artist of the world
To all scientist and intellectuals
To international public opinion

        In Mexico power is hardening and the presence of military
intelligence begins to be felt in civil meetings and in governmental
decisions.

        Before having to ask for help to alleviate the disaster we want
to prevent it. The consultation that the Zapatista Army of National
Liberation (EZLN) delivers to us today is a wake-up call that can
radically change the destiny for Mexicans and probably for the entire
world.

        The five questions that Zapatistas ask, oviously refer to
their needs, resulting from social, economics and political oppresion
of which they have been victims. However in a broader sense they
speak to the necessities of all Mexicans, and as they relate to the
horrors that the neo-leberal system has wrought, they become an
issue of world-wide interest.

        We submit for your review the following proposal:

        To organiza an intense promotional campaign for the
consultation in as many spaces as possible, concert hall, theaters,
workshops, seminars, exhibits, video and film screenings, radio and
television programs, the press, magazines, interviews, electronic mail
and other contemporary media.

        In addition you can organize new activities during the  month of
July to concide with the schedule outlined by the Zapatistas; July for
the international and August for the national consultation.

        We are proposing that each country organize the consultation
in its own way, with us sharing the basic information, but allowing
you and your organizations to design the methodology and the plan
of action.

        We would like for some of you to visit our country and if
possible give concerts or public forums; your international profile can
help enormously to shape public opinion and to raise money which is
in our case very scarce.

        Therefore, it would be great to promote the consultation
through some Mexicans personality. In fact, trips to varius countries
have already been organized by members of the comission of the comission of
international linkage, and we hope to count on your support if
possible in inviting Mexican artist to perform in your countries for
the benefit of this project.

In my case, as part of the international commission and as a
musician, I can propose a simple performance, requiring only a piano
and a microphone, although I would prefer to travel with an assistent.

        We are addressing all of those concerned for democracy, justice
and liberty, to all those who in a book, a song or symphony express
their commitment to the truth. To those in your classroom, in a
conference or in your work who are everyday marking an effort so
that the world would be better.

        We want Mexico to heve its first elections without manipulation
by the authorities, we want to get rid of the impossibility of
participating in the construction of a more habitable country.

        We trust in your intelligence, talent, and sensibility, we need
you.

Fraternally
Guillermo Brisen~o

P.S. If you want more information, please contact Guillermo Brisen~o,
tel 661 8312 and 539 6548 (fax) in Mexico D.F. or the numbers and
e-mail addresses that accompany this invitation.

P.P.S. In Mexico, the non-governmental organization Alianza Civica
will be in charge of the consultation an the Convencion Nacional
Democratica (CND), of which we are a part, will undertake its
promotion. The CND is also responsible for both organizing and
promoting, with your help, the consultation on an international level.

To bring the twin trains head-on: after reading a lot of surrealist
poetry and then Lyn Hejnian (whose work SLEEPS Rachel Blau DuPlessis
called 'dreamlike without being surreal') I got convinced that the "ghost
in the machine" of language poetry was the female misreader in western
tradition, materialized in a sort of nondominance game played with(in)
characters of language itself-- the literalizing female misreader,
somehow caught poetically in the act (the way you can see a person
backspacing over typos in a spilt-screen conversation)

Like Francesca of Paolo fame... which reminds me of the article that
started all this, Susan Noakes' "On the Superficiality of Women"

Just a thought (does anyone know who this Gaspara Stampa was, that Rilke
rites about in the DUINO ELEGIES?)

Marisa writes abt the "misreader being caught in the act" and
likens it to split screen conversations typos. I like this idea
and found myself in it today thinking abt palimpsest. It strikes me
that Marisa is right on with  regards to Hejinian. But I would say
that, if palimpsest is another term for what is being described, this
is also a feature, structural and conceptual, of at least some
serial poem forms. Anyone?
Thanks, Marisa. I'm off to look at My Life.

this sounds really cool and smart but i'm not sure i know what you mean by "the
ghost in the machine" of language poetry; why a specifically *female*
(mis)reader for *langpo* specifically.  ah--do you mean that langpo somehow
"enacts" or literalizes a process of (an arguably politicized or politicizable)
"mis"reading that is traditionally associated with or practiced by women?  like
stein or jane bowles who sometimes sound as if they got the idiom just a little
bit wrong accidentally on purpose, and end up remaking language?  this may be
why i teach a lot of women language poets (in a number of courses entitled
everything from "weird books by women" to "ecriture feminine and women language
poets" to "women and the literature of trauma) and hardly any men, though i'm
beginning to appreciate the male poets (mostly through live readings).  I find
it realtively easy to associate language "techniques" and rationales with
women's "concerns," though i've thought of that as my problem, a kind of
intellectual laziness or self-interested essentialism.  I like the way you put
it --if i read you right --if i read you wrong could you clarify?--md

Oh, I didn't get that impression at all.  I think the "mis" in "misreading"
is ironic.  If I'm not mistaken, that comes from its use in the argument
over whether the reader ever really "gets" the author's "intended meaning".
Insofar as the language employed by the author is polysemic, "every reading
is a misreading" of the author's intent.  But these misreadings, because the
reader takes *some* meaning from them, become nonetheless tremendously
liberating to the reader who stops worrying whether the author intended a
certain meaning or not.  And the palimpsest is similar--the writer tries to
erase previous texts and lay a new one on top, but never fully succeeds; the
reader can always see through to the other levels, to varying degrees.  Some
writers acknowledge these freedoms of the reader and use them as a means of
maximizing the joy and freedom of writing, by allowing for the reader's
intentionality and/or playing with possible "pretexts"; and I think this is
a valid assertion to make about Lyn's work.

There's a very simple randomizing hypercard stack (therefore Macintosh
only) called Dada Poet. This has very few user definable parameters, and it
is quite random, not useful if you're interested in maintaining a semblance
of grammar or syntax, but it is capable of some interesting bucket-brigade
effects, in addition to general randomizing.

Travesty is available for IBM-compatibles. I haven't used this but based on
the book Sentences, recently published by Sun & Moon (don't forget to look
for those blue M&Ms!), it seems to do some interesting things.

If Bruce Malcolm is interested in doing some syntactic programming-level
work, there's a very powerful, and funny, program called Kant Generator Pro
that is set up to write large chunks of Kantian prose. The program also has
modules for Husserlian prose, excuses, thank-you notes and several
mathematical modules useful for programming in Pascal. It's possible to
modify any of these modules to do other kinds of random generation within a
generalized syntactic structure from list of vocabulary and/or phrases,
but, as I said above, this takes some work. Kant Generator Pro is a GNU
program, I have it for Mac, but I think it's available for other computer
platforms, too.

These are also several different anagram programs around, but that may be
more text manipulation than you're looking for.

I don't have addresses for these programs readily at hand, but all of them
should be available on the Internet with archy, gopher, or some other
search program.

I've heard of several other programs that I haven't seen in action. I'd be
interested in any other such programs people know of.

Tony Green asked, in the context of the discussion about rules v looser

These are finished compositions, but they also serve as exercises for
performers who, by playing these compositions get practice in some
particular technique, fingering, rhythmic patterns, articulation, etc.

A related kind of poem-as-etude might be text-sound pieces which, if
performed by people other than the originating writer, give the performer
the opportunity to stretch their vocal "chops" in ways they haven't
previously.

A less directly related kind of "etude" might be any poems which are so
unlike one's own thinking that to read them is to "exercise" one's
intellect.

That said, I think that because poems are rarely performed by readers other
than the poet who wrote them (except of course in those enlightened
classrooms people have been detailing in other threads), there are very few
poems that serve the same kind of function as musical "etudes" do.

people have about posting the text of other writer's poems on <poetics>.

Now I'm not a prude about this-I've dubbed and photocopied plenty of things
for myself and others. But I dont' recall anyone saying they'd send a xerox
when people posted to the list asking about the availability of a
particular book or poem.

Did this seem odd to anyone else?

In any event, I think those LP recordings of Brathwaite's were of him
reading The Arrivants, not Middle Passage, which is too recent a book to be
released on vinyl by any semi-conscious company.

Though George Bowering will be glad to note that albums by megapop stars
like Hole are often pressed on vinyl for the collector's market.

You're kidding, right?  They *should* be *required*?
Just like that?  All students?  Every class?

Every unqualified "should" and its unqualified
affirmation gets me to thinking: What is gained
and lost in this kind of conversation?

Obviously one thing that's lost is any concept of a
non-pedagogical possibility for poetry.  Who said the
students in the class were going to be teachers?
Carl's response, not to put too fine a point on it,
constructs a seemingly inevitable linear development
from student to teacher.  Just because many on this list,
including me, have moved in such a direction doesn't mean
that others might take a poetry course for a hundred other
reasons, just as valid.  And just because somebody decides
that *they* "should" teach poetry writing in a poetry
reading course doesn't mean that others "should" follow.

I'm not saying they shouldn't.  I have gone both ways,
depending on the occasion, and found benefits in
several different class-constructions.

Not all of us teach poetry as "art," either.

Apologies for the tendentiousness of this post.

Have read Pinker, will comment soon, but just to say: Pinker's not a
social scientist, strictly speaking, but a cognitive neuroscientist.  He's
very close to a biologist, in fact.  So he doesn't just hate popular
social scientists: if you read the last chapter of his book, you'll see he
hates them ALL!

david,

yes, i am serious. what i'm aiming at in my statement is the notion of
the poem as a way of knowing. several initial questions immediately come
to mind: --how could one _teach_ that? --how does one _demonstrate_ that?
my current studies are such that these questions are of immense interest
to me. i don't see this approach (and it's one of many approaches) as
linear, either

Glad to hear it.  It just seemed to me that the discussion was in danger
of turning into a seminar on what a poetry class should be; I didn't

I was reading from "Meaning Is to Be Here," A Selction from the Daybook
of George Oppen (edited by Cynthia Anderson, Conjunctions 10) to a group
of writers in a summer program here in Providence, and found a few
fragments that seemed relevant to discussions here:


I will have to say what I can without the magnificent King's x. No disclosures,
of course, that I can make, but just to say truthfully what it is to live. And
see: or begin. Because someday -- everyone will be terrified. They have so far
managed to find militant atheism or disguised atheism as comforting as militant
religion or disguised religion. It won't last much longer. The physical
scientists are giving no one any peace. The philosophers are strangely
exhilarated to be proving rigorously that their statements don't mean
anything or have no importance. Won't last long. Raises a question of
survival. We must somehow get hold of what we know and what we can't know,
and begin, to live with it. Not an abstract, nor even a private matter. Most
of our laws are theocratic: our punishments assume an absolute moral judgment.
The death penalty could not exist today without the habit of speaking of a
transcendental morality. Our judgments and our punishments are theocratic.
They will collapse. We had better start talking. We must wean ourselves from
narrative, which is everyone's art form, because everyone really knows -- it
is the most obvious of facts -- that every life ends badly. Very badly. Not
only death, but loneliness, desertions *irreparable* physical injury. Every
ship sinks. All the calamities the hero escapes he does not escape. We had
better talk. Even tho we are afraid of being overheard by the children. Or
someday we will die of despair when we overhear the children. We haven't begun
to talk, or we have talked nonsense. A simple poetic undertaking: to see if
life is livable, to make life livable. Without lying. Not that I wouldn't be
glad to: people are becoming too discerning. We are consciously lying to each
other by now. But I mean to become part of a discussion among honest people.

                    (p. 189)

               *An epigrammatic post-script:*

'Form is never more than an extension of content'
It had better not be an *extension! perhaps a compression*
                                                         Form is
what makes the poem *graspable*

Sincerity is the attention outward.
Objectification is creation
           obviously enough.

to write at the moving edge is both of these, or perhaps
more than these
                                              *the infinite*

                    (p. 199)


i do not hear the rhythm as the poem forms -- the beginning, the speed of
the poem -- rather it is a shape, in fact a silence     The shape silently
forms as if 'above' me -- the effort of the writing, the finding of the
cadence is the care not to shatter this presence -- tho often it must be
shattered and only then restored

                     (p. 200)

Cheers,

[appologies to Ira who's heard this already--]

I had read in Cixous recently that she locates the soul at the body.
Which I thought was groovy, but was still thinking on how this is.  I
mean to say that I liked the idea that the body was the locus of the
soul, but what did this mean.
Then on Saturday I was listening to a program on NPR about vocalese--how
do you spell that?--which is when the singer tries to make his/her voice
behave as closely as possible to the way a musical instrument
behaves--and I thought, THAT'S IT!!  That is writing the body (cf Cixous)--
makingthe language behave as closely as possible to the way the body
behaves-- and that is how/why the body as the location of the soul works for me.

If we make the soul of the same behaviors of the body--labor, sweat, sex,
touch (to communicate is also to touch, remember)--we can deal with it.
If soul, or consciousness--and I think they are awfully the same--are
always absent--and absence--always off, away from us in the ether
somewhere--how can we know them, or even experience them, and most
especially articulate them?
But if the body is the soul--it does become present--and a presence--we
can know it, experience it, share it--WRITE IT.

Soul is important--it is what writing has been about and after as long as
their has been writing.  But I think, I really do, that if we allow the
body to be the soul, that writing becomes a lot more successful, more
COMMUNICATIVE. . .

On the origins of poems topic I  used the word soul and I'm really
impressed with the continuing debate.  Howxever I still must say the soul
is my center of inspiration.

It has nothing to do with organized religion or or celestial sensations.
It's the part of me that exist beyond the buzzing of my neurons and the
pumping of my blood.  It is that which translates chemical  reActions and
elctric stimlations of living into the thought I pour on to the page.
The mind and the body are extingiushable, but not the soul.  The mind and
body are needed in order to function in life, but a soul is needed in
death.
        I'm not sure if poetry is really needed any where, but it does prove to
be a nice fringe benefit.  The fact that creativity is not a necessity in
the basics of life (food, shelter) but is such an integeral part of my
own being comforts me.  It is an unexplain element in my life that I must
feed and satisfy, therefore I will nurture it and label it my soul
because I can only hope it will serve a greater purpose later in my life/ or
in my death.

I was just in a fairly minor car accident the other day--i.e. i'm more or
less fine, tho' the car wuz "totalled."  Anyway, the rental i'm driving has
a sticker reading "Berglund," presumably the name of the car dealer, on its
rear, and the osteopath i wuz sent to is nambed Gelburd.  I can't get the
fact that these are nearly perfect anagrams out of my head.  This partly
has to do with the way memory works i guess--i keep misremembering the
doctor's name, and so have continually to rehearse the differance.  But
also has to do i suppose with the/my tendency/compulision to read
everything, even a car accident as a linguistic event.

Does this sort of thing happen to "you" too?

And btw, has anyone seen The Postman (Italian flick about Neruda in Italian
exile and his relationship with the titular mailman, or to be less
poetcentric, it's about the mailman's relation to Neruda).  Pretty
romanticized i guess, but i was rather touched to see some sort of
film treatment of what it means "to be a poet," and of the social fact of
being-a-poet as well (not just the tortures of the Divine and Solitary
Afflatus, like a bad case of gastroindigestion etc etc

(and even my mailman/poet centricity qualifications above are inadequate,
'cause the mailman does turn out to be a sort of poet too...

As the "list lurker" who loves Niedecker and was supposedly "attacked," I
just have to say, George, I interpreted your comment just as you meant
it. I was glad you responded to my admiration of Niedecker and suggested
another poet whose work I might like as well.

When I was researching Spicer for George I didn't come across one ( a
reading of Language, that is. And that was my central focus). The
Contemporary Lit. Collection here at Simon Fraser actually had one
or two readings, I think, besides the Vancouver Lectures. I think
Charles Watts is on the list still. He knows best. Charles?

yes, i'd in fact suggest the berkeley renaissance crowd, of which Dick was an

no, george, it means simply, for one thing, that no two people read a book the same way, or, elegantly, from emerson: "it depends on the mood of the man, whether he shall see the sunset or the fine poem." - "we see only what we animate."

Carl, wouldn't it get in the way, not knowing what the instruction
means: write a poem.  Write a what?  what counts as a poem?  finding
that out is something between teacher and student.  Do you get faced
with: I cannot do this exercise, because you have provided
insufficient protocols for me to begin.  (I got this last year from
disgruntled students who had, with some additional specifications,
been asked to write an introduction to an imaginary exhibition. How
much worse with a "poem".  What models for poem do you 1 offer,
2 propose,3 advise, 4 leave blank?)

Now that I've seen what it is, I want to thank Kenneth Goldsmith for,

people's summer/bedside reading lists. This should not be a thankless task.

After getting nearly three weeks of mail at once, I've ended up nuking lots
of posts (none of the really important, and interesting, ones by you who is
reading this now, of course-just those other messages) before really
reading them & found (oops) I'd lost a few book references I'd wanted to
keep in this way. Many of them were still around 'cause I'd saved Kenneth's
Reading List post(s).

(Just what I need, a list of more books I haven't read yet or want to
re-read.) But really, thanks, Kenneth.

i'm maria not marisa, but i know who susan noakes is cuz until just a year ago
she was dean of faculty in my division of this huge state university.  she's a
french scholar/medievalist feminist, and she's really nice, she was really
helpful in my tenure process and sympathetic to the incredible tsoris i
encountered at the hands of my incompetent and unethical departmental superiors.
now she's part time at U North Carolina and part time here, at Minnesota, in
each univ's respective french dept.  i'm sure she;d be tickled to know her work
was being read/lauded on the poetics list. she also has an essay in the jonathan
boyarin collection i mentioned a few months ago, from UMN press, on the
anthropology of reading (can't remember the main title, book's in office, i;m at
home).  is that the article you mean, marisa? (i must confess i've not read the
boyarin book, except for his own essay, and i've not read my colleague s
noakes's work either).--md

yes of course.  the person (who will remain nameless) who said this was someone

does this, perhaps, have anything to do with deleuze's hypothesis that the self
is an unstable, shimmering boundary between two becomings?  what wd happen if
the word "soul" was used here?  also, brian, the only thing that comes to mind
in your very interesting query is some big deal (though physically "slim") book
about freud that came out in the 80s, excerpted in the New Yorker, by some big
deal guy, maybe Bruno Bettelheim? could that be?  claiming that the word freud
used for ...was it consciousness?  mind?  self?  you can see these secondhand
references make a deep impression ...could actually be profitably, and
faithfully (no pun intended) translated and/or understood as "soul."  i don't
know if that rescues the word from mysticism or conversely imputes a mystical
bent to freud, but there you have it.  maybe this is as flaky an idea as
"gnostic platonism."--md

tony,

--these are important questions and i appreciate them, thank-you.
interesting: i just just talked with one of my instructors for medieval lit.
abt an essay draft. she told me it was an excellent paper, but distant.
_distant_! --i had know idea what she meant by that --> for a second. then
she noted to me that "there is no _you_ in this paper." i asked her: do
you mean there's no _poetical_ i? "exactly," she said. i suspect that it
is my unfamiliarity with the material which inspired the death of my
poetical i in this paper. but i'm going to go back to this essay and find
it. i'm not sure how but this relates to your post. we are words and our
meanings change (bp)

take care,

Steve--the Hatlen essay on Oppen's "Wittgensteinian" (as opposed to
Poundian or Imagist) aesthetic is in SAGETRIEB, one of the first issues
so I think around '83.  I don't have the reference at my fingertips--if
you can't find, I'll look at my files.  I think it was vol. 1 or 2 of
SAGETRIEB and he's arguing that Oppen and Zukofsky can't be understood
via the Pound-Williams axis.  Now that I think of it, the essay deals
more with Zukofsky than with Oppen but the point holds because Burt is
talking about the Objectivists in a broader way.

Charles Alexander asked David Kellog, and I'm paraphrasing, If we

Well, I'd  like to butt in, if I may.  I haven't taught poetry, yet.
But the first alternative that jumps to my mind is poetry as symbolic
action (Burke). Genres and formal registers as the signatures of
a or many discursive communities.  I suppose, if this is not teaching
it as "art", then this goes back to--oh god, no==poetry as politics
and authority (or authorities). I'll stop here because i don't want
to go out there today. I'm feeling fragile.

It is really such a pleasure to post to this list (esp. at 4:30AM!)--
thanks to all (Ryan, Rod, Steve, Maria, Burt, Maria, and several
back-channelers) who ask and rescue so intriguingly.

Susan Noakes' essay "On the Superficiality of Women" is in a collection
she edited with Clayton Koelb, called THE COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE ON
LITERATURE (Cornell UP 1988).  Elements of the argument may well appear
in her book TIMELY READING: BETWEEN EXEGESIS AND INTERPRETATION-- which I
haven't seen, but whose title illustrates, I'd guess, her attempt to
re-mark the dichotomous western repertoire of 'figures of reading'
(good/bad, active/passive, penetrating/superficial, legitimate/illegitimate,
male/female).  Noakes reads Bonaventure, Dante, Sterne, Rousseau, and
Flaubert for depictions of female misreaders whose "superficial reading is
an indicator of moral deficiency" (it ain't hard for her to find them
there) not jest to show that this is a privileged topos in western lit.,
but also (she hopes) to ease the impasse in the field of hermeneutics
(1988: deconstruction & its critics) by questioning the meaning of these
obsessively dichotomous signs of reading. (well, okay, 'jest' was a joke!)

As I reread the piece, I felt that it was a shame that Noakes doesn't
just recuperate this figure of the cheeky "suerficial" misreader for
feminist or otherwise devious purposes, which is what I think Hejinian
does at times, especially in MY LIFE.  Of course I would have to work a
lot harder to make this argument run smoothly (for one thing, I'm working
with a model of poetic text materialized AS a sort of reading.. for
another, I'm nowhere near my copy of Hejinian's book.)

The word 'misreading' was rescued ably by Steve-- thanks Steve!-- and
I wld like to add jazz improvisation to his suggested list of its kindred
techniques (palimpsest, serial form).  Hejinian absolutely seems to me a
'clean' writer: very careful with/in her writing, working word by word
and even syllable by syllable to create patterns and inviting drifts of
meaning. It seems paradoxically controlled-- and yet-- I saw her read at
Temple a year or so back, and was struck by the way she tossed the pages to
the side, once read.  She even called attention to the gesture as one she
picked up from watching jazz musicians perform, and it really brought the
element of purposive play from within her work.

Rod Smith's posting, then, interested me: I think when anyone mines the
less 'controllable' resources of language profoundly-- the results look
somehow 'awry,' a-miss, unmasterful... this is worse when the writer's
female and others (!editors!) all too readily question their
'mastery' of the language.  This happened with Dickinson and it happened
with Loy-- both of whom are, like Hejinian of course-- miles ahead of
their readers. Like Maria I am readily engrossed by writers who seem to
be "getting the idea just a little bit wrong accidentally on purpose"--
and end up reinventing the medium in the process.

Just to clarify my original post, then, borrowing from Maria's almost
miraculous paraphrase: "Langpo 'enacts' or literalizes a process of (an
arguably politicized or politicizable) 'mis'reading that is traditionally
associated with or practiced by women"-- 'women' understood as
discursive entities (Noakes' female misreaders: Eve, Francesca, Emma
Bovary...), as flesh-and-blood-and-soul language practitioners, and as
textual operations or characters within language itself.

Silly, probably, in these last 5AM formulations... but-- tenable?

I would love to learn more (particularly since I tend to think Fanny
among the most underappreciated poets of my generation). I love the
poetry, but my lack of the terms here always prevents me from seeing
her lyrics, even at their most openly spiritual, as Gnostic. Can you

Marisa,

Found this in _Rilke, a Life_ by Wolfgang Leppmann:

"While working on _Malte Laurids Brigge_, he became engrossed
once more in the type of unrequited love, transcending its
object, that he found represented by women like the Renaissance
poetess Gaspara Stampa..."

Reading a little in this book makes me long for an antidote of
Kafka, or at least Woody Allen: "Getting through the night is
becoming harder and harder. Last evening, I had the uneasy
feeling that some men were trying to break into my room to
shampoo me. But why? I kept imagining I saw shadowy forms, and
at 3 a.m. the underwear I had draped over a chair resembled the
Kaiser on roller skates. When I finally did fall asleep, I
had that same hideous nightmare in which a woodchuck is trying
to claim my prize at a raffle. Despair."

Hope the (Stampa) reference helps--

In-Reply-To:  <199507170403.AAA16609@gwis2.circ.gwu.edu>

Years ago I explored a little Heidegger in connection with Oppen.
I do believe Oppen was affected by H., validated in his perception of the
wondrousness of the moment, or of at least some moments of existential
focus & attunement (related to the Heideggerian notion of "clearing").
No doubt Oppen was also affected by Wittgenstein; and by modern
mathematics; and other philosophers.

When I spent a couple of weeks with George and Mary in January 1978, in
S.F., examining their library, his notes, and speaking with them several
hours a day, I found a copy of Heidegger on the table beside the reading
chair in their kitchen/dining room/living room, right beside the box of
fig newtons.  But George said to me, "I don't know what I really got out
of that [referring to Heidegger] -- I don't really understand it," -- or
words which I took to have that meaning.  He was already complaining a lot
about his loss of memory (though he actually appeared unimpeded, and to be
able to recall a great deal), and his being somewhat befuddled by his
earlier self's seeming to have been nourished by Heidegger =could=
conceivably be explained as relating to the onset of weakened intellectual
acumen due to senility.  Or it could be explained by the older man's
judgment that his younger self hadn't known as much as much as he'd
thought at the time.  Which could be correct or incorrect.

My own work focuses on poetry as a social field -- a discourse which, like
any other, has certain self-emerging rules, codes of reproduction, and so
forth.  I want to analyze this field without isolating certain things as
"art."  Rather, I analyze the very process of such isolation which goes on
very well without my help, thank you very much.  This is not to exclude
perspectives which art-ify the subject, only to ensure that other
perspectives, including my rather sociological one, are not barred from
the get-go.

For more info: I suppose this is the time to mention my essay forthcoming
in *Cultural Critique*, who knows when, this summer or fall, called
"Literary History and the Problems of Oppositional Practice in
Contemporary Poetry."  It makes an argument for the usefulness of a
concept of a social field, which I call "the poetic," bearing roughly the
same resemblance to poetry as "sexuality" does to "sex" in Foucault.

Cheers,
David

Righto!  Though we don't need the self-justification of political ends to
rationalize the analysis of the workings of a community.  If there's no
outside such communities (Burke), texts (Derrida), fields (Bourdieu), then
transcendence is a sham anyway, and political as well as artistic forms of
liberation need to be qualified.

While looking for these programs this morning, I found what should be a

in algorithmically distorting previously written text. The page is called
<Computer Generated Writing> & the URL is
<http://www.uio.no/~mwatz/c-g.writing>.

From this page you can download most of the programs previously mentioned
and many others for Macintosh, IBM, and Unix machines. There are also links
to related sites, some of which generate text while you wait. For example,
if there are any graduate students who haven't chosen a dissertation topic
on the list, there's a link to a site that generates postmodern thesis
abstracts.

I downloaded a few programs, but won't have a chance to try them out for a
day or two.

   On July 16 Lindz Williamson wrote:  "The mind and body are needed in order

 to contend with, as it implies first a strangely robotic view of living beings
, (although I know western tradition would support a kind of separation of the
 two) and second, an insistence on the Christian view of the soul, which seems
to negate what I find most vital to the line of poetry descending from the
 Imagist/Objectivist tradition.  George Oppen used the word "faith" to describe
 his poetics (and here I will quote him from Michael Heller's book on the
 Objectivists):  "faith" "that the nouns do refer to something; that it's there
, that it's true, the whole implication of these nouns; that appearances repres
ent reality, whether or not they misrepresent it."  I like this use of the
word "faith," and feel that term with strongly religious connotations can shed
light on secular poetry, and, in so doing, be reclaimed so to speak.  I guess
my point here is that I am sorry to see the word "soul" condemned to "death,"
when it has so much to offer to the living.

Subject:      Imagining Beckett's Notebooks

          Hello List,

          Lately I've been thinking a lot about the notebooks
          (journals? diaries?) of Samuel Beckett. He must certainly
          have kept some, and imagining what they might contain has
          filled a few idle moments rather roundly.

          Where are they? What has become of them? Is anyone at work
          editing them or do they languish somewhere, not to see the
          light of day for years hence? Does anyone know anything
          about this?

          I should mention that my interest in notebooks, diaries, and
          journals runs far beyond fantasizing about Beckett's
          possible jottings. My groovy, now, a-go-go lifestyle only
          allows me to read for pleasure a very little bit, certainly
          not with the sustained attention required to complete even a
          short novel read in a linear fashion in a reasonable amount
          of time. Thus I like things that can be dipped into almost
          anywhere, at any time, without the need to maintain any sort
          of continuity. (Like poetry).

          Some examples of the genre I've been through are Gide's
          notebooks, a little volume of Ionesco called, I believe,
          "Past/Present, Present/Past," a number of Antaeus devoted to
          the form, John Cheever's journal, and, and of course Kafka,
          uh....others. Can anyone recommend any of this sort of writing that I
          should know about?

          I suppose this thing could lead into a more general
          discussion (as these things seem to do) of whether the
          author should (does?) have a concious literary intent in
          journalizing. Can such a thing be avoided? Can someone write
          a journal which is REALLY not intended for another reader?

          Lurking here,
          John Krick

Someone (sorry I forget who) recently mentioned a Lawrence Rainey essay on HD
that apparently calls her a minor poet because she didn't write manifestoes or
publicly articulate a poetics outside her poetry. I'd be interested to see
this--can you please provide the full reference? If this summary is accurate,
I find it mind-boggling that this argument can still get made. But then it's
not so long ago that a highly regarded Dickinson scholar, David Porter, was
questioning ED's "majority" ("divine majority"?) for the same reason.

Gale, thanks for the wonderful, moving quotations from Oppen. Every time I
re-encounter him, which I try to do as often as possible, I'm reminded what a
great human being he was as well as a great poet.

On another subject, does the list know about Robert Sheppard's ongoing labor
of love, Pages, subtitled "resources for the linguistically innovative
poetries" of the UK? Many of you will, but perhaps some won't. It's a great
resource for texts of and information on current "experimental" British
poetries, and the arrival of recent issues on Cris Cheek and John Wilkinson
coupled with the metion of Glyn Maxwell prompted me to mention it. Each issue
of Pages is about 20-25 pages, around half or so devoted to new work by the
writer and the other half to a couple of short essays on his/her work and a
bibliography. I've found it a great way to keep in touch with and learn more
about recent interesting British work. Issues beyond those I've mentioned have
included (I'm working from memory here) Hazel Smith, Ulli Freer, Gilbert
Adair, Adrian Clarke. Robert plans twelve issues on 12 writers, and I'm not
sure where we're up to, but they're available from Robert Sheppard, 239
Lessingham Avenue, London SW17. Single issues are 3 pounds sterling, or all 12
for 12 pounds (though I paid in dollars). Talk your libraries into getting
them too!

I lost a ton of mail from around 6/30 to 7/12 in a system crash, so if anyone
wrote to me then, please try again. It's not that I'm ignoring you!

Thanks for the clarification, Ron. I was thinking mostly of the extreme
patterning of sentence-types in Garfield (if "patterning" is the right term
for what looks like pretty even distribution) or the 12 twelve-line verses
that read like parody/homages early on in Oz, but also some of the slighter
stylistic differences between months in Jones (which otherwise reads like

And where do you draw the line on something like this?

Do students have to write novels to understand the way of thinking that
novelists bring to bear on their work (Do they have to write one in the
style of Kathy Acker and then one in the style of William Gaddis and then
one in the style of Angela Carter and then one in the style of Edmund
Crispin, so they get a sense of the breadth of what passes for novels
today?)

Do they have to know how to paint to take art history classes?

For that matter, do you have to know how to sew to wear clothes or to like
the way they look? Do you have to be able to fix a car (I won't even say
build one) to be able to drive?

One of the problems people have in learning advanced math & science comes
from being expected to recreate the thinking used in labwork or proofs,
without having enough background to understand where the thinking comes
from.

& let's face it, poetry isn't much less arcane than math or science for
most people.

This is probably one of those posts for which I need the disclaimer that
I'm not a poet.

I'm not a teacher, either.

Today in the Globe and Mail, the TV reviewer in talking about a

couple of weeks ago I heard that 1955 lecture in which Leonard
Bernstein explains jazz. At one point, he compares a song done by
Bessy Smith and the same song done by an opera type. "Souless" might
be a good word to describe the second version.

Dear Alan:

Yeah, the essay is in a collection called *Representing Modernist
Texts*. It's an interesting essay. His main target is certain
tendencies in HD scholarship which, from my point of view, can use
some healthy criticism. The problem is that Rainey's miscogynism gets
in the way, he's so anxious to tar feminist criticism generally. The
attack on HD is by way of proving that all those girls are wrong and
HD's really not all that good a poet. The point about her being an
intellectual light weight because she didn't engage in polemics about
poetics is part of his making of that case.

There was recently a big faluffle about it over on the HD list. I'd be
interested to know what you think after you read it.

Best,
Mike

well, the purposes are different.   i don't do it only so that students can get
a sense of being "inside" a particular writer's process, though that's part of
it; sometimes, for the more analytically minded, it helps to illuminate what it
is they think characterizes a writer's style.  then we can discuss that, whether
it's so or not, etc.  for example, when i have students imitate a writer who is
African American, often the students use what they think is Black English in
ways tht the writer never does --in third person narration, when the writer only
uses it in dialogue, or for characters that, in fact, use standard english.  or,
for example with Lyn Hejinian's My Life, some people wrote about their
childhoods without using any other aspects of her style...in imitating ginsberg,
some use lots of "obscenities" and others simply repeat the word "holy" at the
beginning of lists of their friends and favorite hangouts.  so its a useful
exercise in several different ways.  sometimes simply by emulating the sentence
structure of, say, emily bronte students stretch their own syntactic
imaginations.

and i do envy those who can sew their own clothes and fix their own cars, and do
believe my life would be richer, or i'd be less intimidated by cars and clothes,
if i knew even a few rudimentaries. i especially wish i knew how to brawl,
physically, cuz i envy the insouciance with which people who do know how to take
care of themselves in that way enter high-risk places at high-risk times of
day/night.--md

Aristotle's location of the soul in the pineal gland ranks as one of the
great anatomical achievements of classical times, despite his having being
savaged by Allen Ginsberg almost in the same way that Steven P (in the
Language Instinct) savaged Saint Benjamin Lee Whorf (or Einstein Newton
to give an example from another field of human knowledge).

I've never seen the benefit of trying to define soul, or to try and
make it a less hazy or indistinct concept as some listers have been
trying to do--to the end of rejecting it as a meaningful idea/word.
It's a word that crops up in the presence of a sense of depth, it's a
word with no referent whatsoever except for this feeling of depth.
How, from a materialist perspective, is this a problem/threat?

It seems that we could divide the listings on the issue of soul into
two general areas--an irritated an impatient rejection of the word
along materialistic lines, and a willingness to use the word and
entertain the idea along sensual lines--that is, a willingness to use
it in situations that seem to call for it.
I like the irreverence of Filet-o-Soul and Soul train and baby's got
soul and all of that. I guess I'm having a harder time understanding
the sense of impatience that comes through in some of the postings,
the desire to banish the idea altogether as an embarassing
anachronism. Just because it's used in pop songs and sappy poetry
doesn't make it nonsense, and just because it has been used by
repressive religion to authorize repression doesn't make it any less
of a present, pressing phenomenon. And it is just for this reason
that we can't talk about it without some heat.

Yeah, I'm still on the list. Ryan, you missed it. We (the Contemporary
Literature Collection at the Bennett Library, Simon Fraser University)
have a tape of Spicer reading, with Robin Blaser and Stan Persky, at the
New Design Gallery in Vancouver in June, 1965. He reads "Thing Language,"
"Intermissions," "Transformations," "Morphemics," "Phonemics," and
"Graphemics." We have another copy of a tape on which Spicer reads all
the foregoing, plus "Love Poems." I don't know -- haven't listened to
them in a long time -- whether they are two recordings of the same
reading or recordings of two separate readings, the one at the New Design
Gallery, the other at Warren Tallman's.

Anyone can listen to these tapes here at SFU. If someone wants a copy for
her own listening, she must apply to Spicer's literary executor, Robin
Blaser, for authorization to allow a copy to be made. And we'll need a
copy of that authorization on file in order to make the copy. Charges for
fast copying and postage would apply. And the understanding would be that
no further copies of that copy would be made.

Cheers,

I guess if any sense of impatience came through in my posts, it's because the
word "soul" has so many different meanings that it leads to the risk of real
misunderstanding. If I said, for example, that "my poetry comes from my soul"
and someone replies, "ah, you mean the part of you that lives on after you
die", then that is NOT what I meant. When soul=mind, soul=consciousness, soul=
emotions, soul=body and soul=immortal spirit, communication really breaks down.

I know that misreadings and ambiguities are not only (to some extent)
inevitable within language, they can be desirable as well. It's just that when
a word has specific implications for some people, and these implications are
definitely NOT what I want to convey, then I cease to find that word useful,
either in poetry or prose.

For example, when Lindz talks of the mind and body being extinguishable, but
not the soul, then this is not what I want to say. I like Shaunanne's
formulation of the soul being the consciousness - this is closer to the
mysteries of selfhood that I think a lot of people mean when speaking casually
of the "soul". The word "consciousness" does not require the soul to live
independently of the body (a fascinating book on consciousness, including
stories by Borges and Stanislaw Lem, and essays and dialogues by Douglas R
Hofsdatder and Daniel C Dennett, is _The Mind's I_, edited by Hofsdatder and
Dennett), but does lead to a broad discourse on selfhood, subjectivity and what
it means to be an "I".

However, it's not what I'd use to describe the source of my poetry. The word
"mind", while it may seem hopelessly broad and general, sums up for me the vast
range of mental processes - from the neural structures that shape my aural and
visual perceptions, the unconscious machinations of the dream-state, the net of
language in which my ego is caught, to the conscious cognitive processes that
constitute my judgement of structure, rhythm and image - that result in words
being set down upon the page.

Moving on, I'm intrigued by the discussion of "gnostic poets". What does
everyone take the word "gnostic" to mean? My dictionary defines it as "having
esoteric spiritual knowledge" - which would include theologians, channellers,
druids, tohunga, pantheists and a slew of other mystical heirophants - but I
assume that there is a more precise definition. To me, as an agnostic, it would
mean "everything that I'm not". I remember an anecdote about Bertrand Russell
being imprisoned, and his gaoller asking him "Religion?" so that he could fill
out his form. When Russell replied "agnostic", the warder furrowed his brows,
then looked at him thoughtfully and said "Well, I guess we all worship the same
god, don't we?"

On another tack, I think it was Marjorie who said that our generation's poetic/
philosophical mentors were Stein/Wittgenstein, whereas the previous generation
had had Pound/Heidegger or Whitehead/Olson. So, for someone like me whose
philosophical mentors include Popper and Ayer, perhaps Alan Turing, or looking
back to Diderot and d'Holbach, who would occupy the poetic side of the
relation?

Just a few thoughts,

        Tom.

Since there appears to be some confusion on this matter, let me assure
all and sundry that any tape I offer to dub for anybody is either in the
public domain or has been made, by me, with the permission of the author.

The other confusion is due to my own hurry in writing.  The Brathwaite
LP's were, indeed of _The Arrivants_, and include Rights of Passage, not
Middle Passage.  The later tapes I made of Brathwaite include brief
passages from Middle Passage.  These are not for commercial circulation
or rebroadcast, but can be listened to by them's what's doing research.

By the way, I've recently discovered that there is quite a bot of poetry
available on tape from the Pacifica Archive here in L.A. at reasonable
rates.  Quite a bit as well as a bot.  Much of this material is generally
not known about, as it was never distributed through stores (nor made
available on late night TV.)  I've found one fascinating tape from a '64
poetry conference of some type held in San Francsico; the tape I've got
beginbs in the middle of things, so I'm nosing around Pacifica's
microfiche to see what else may have been taped that week.

Apologies agin for all the flubs in my posts -- the cursor keys on this
borrowed system don't do what you'd expect -- When I am in San Jose I am
able to clean up the text before I send it -- but then I miss out on the
sherr pleasures of "beginbs."

Concerning dubs of commercial recordings: thanks to the Audio Home
Recording Act of 1992, all blank audio media when purchased contain
a tariff.  These funds are intended to compensate copyright holders
for loss of royalties that may result from home recordings.  In other
words every time you buy a blank cassette you are automatically making
a royalty payment to a fund divied up between ASCAP, BMI and SESAC,
organizations which exist to collect royalties for and distribute
royalties to the copyright holder.  Distribution is, of course,
based on sales statistics.  So the chances are much better that
ASCAP will assume that the dubs being made are of Michael Jackson's
HISTORY rather that Brathwaite's MIDDLE PASSAGE and give him the
cash (give Jackson, that is) instead of, unfortunately, Brathwaite.
The point is that although the recording industry doesn't want this
to become common knowledge, you purchase the right to make a legal
dub of commercially recorded materials every time you buy a blank
tape as long as that dub isn't intended for resale.  That less
commercial "artists" will never see any of that money is an injustice,
but it is a separate issue.

        Marisa--this is kinda late, but if you're still wondering here's
a note from my copy of Duino Elegies:

        "She was born in 1523, in Padua, of a noble Milanese family, by
whom, as her contemporaries would have said, she was 'exquisitely'
educated.  In Venice, at the age of 26, she fell desperately in love with
the young Collaltino, Count of Collalto and Lord of Treviso.  After a few
years of mutual happiness, he went to France to fight for Henry II,
forgot her, and consoled himself with other beauties.  when at last he
returned, a kind of duty prevented him from openly breaking with the
woman he no longer loved.  At first she was full of happiness; then she
began to learn the truth.  He finally left her and married.  She consoled
herself partly with other lovers and partly with religion, and died in
1554, at the age of 31.  The whole story of her love for Collaltino is
recorded in some 200 sonnets..."

        And on the subject of love letters (I mean yr suggestions, and
now mine, to John Krick, and not Gaspara's):  Joyce has some really weird
letters to Molly around 1916 (?) when she was in Dublin, he away
somewhere on the continent, in which he demands she buy pretty
underclothes for herself...and something about a whip.  --brian

Re these discussions about soulsters, souling, circular solemnity. We don't

interesting essay called "On Genre as Conversion Experience" in which he

seen to mirror the behavior of religious communities. One has a "conversion
experience" to a particular form of artistic practice which one then defines
oneself with/by to the exclusion of other ways of writing/painting/thinking.
Which raises the interesting question of a seeming schism between a very real

Clark Coolidge had a program on KPFA (Pacifica) in the late sixties
that was very NY School oriented, lots of fun to listen to (and was my

What about Jack Spicer's folk music programs (also from KPFA circa
1949-50)? I didn't start listening to KPFA until around 1958 when I got
an FM radio as a christmas present, but my understanding is that Jack &
Robin used to have singers and others into the studio and read and
drink red wine. David Gitin also had a program on KPFA in the 60s. I
remember him playing Olson, for example.

Things to look for in the Archives.

Have fun with your keyboards.

Poetics,

Up late last night and hearing a terrifying story about inhalant-abuse by
native-american children it occurred to me that a better formulation for the
shrine than Wittgen(stein) might be Ashbery/Deleuze...

I _must_ have a body, it's a moral necessity, a "requirement." And in the
first place, I must have a body because an obscure object lives in me. But,
right from this first argument, Leibniz's originality is tremendous. He is
not saying that only the body explains what is obscure in the mind. To the
contrary, the mind is obscure, the depths of the mind are dark, and this dark
nature is what explains and requires a body.
--Gilles Deleuze, _The Fold_, p. 85, UMn Press 1993

So is that why we have texts (even though we write the same poems over and
over)? Or, how do we read Olson (who pretty much transliterates Whitehead and
the historical society into verse) in a Wittgenstein-flooded world? Or, can
you read Olson without turning off your hearing aid? Is that what the
excellent Creeley-edited selected Olson is for, to move Olson across the
divide?

Jest curious,
Jordan

Well Charles Mingus, for one, had a piece called My Jelly Roll Soul, on, I
think, the album titled "Oh Yeah" from the mid 1950s.

&, as long as people are dropping names right & left on the issue of soul=8A

Call me a pagan, but since McCullough & Weiner (among others) located the
mind in the body, I've always assumed that's where the soul was too.

Though I don't think they're the same thing.

I brought up my concerns about ownership & copying tapes or texts for all
the reasons you raise here.

The real issue isn't the law. Copyright law is fucked in a big way,
especially as it pertains to sound recordings. Royalty payments are
collected and redistributed by monopolistic licensing companies (ASCAP &
BMI in the United States) who as you correctly describe it, only understand
the economics of big budget pop music.

The issue is who ends up getting paid for what uses of their work and the
morality of how payments are made for the "fair use" and "individual use"
aspects of the copyright statutes.

I think when you're talking about work with limited sales potential (like
poetry or new music) following the letter of the law doesnt always feel
like it's enough.

I'm not trying to be weirdly puritanical about this. (But I realize that I
am being weirdly puritanical about this.)

Make copies of whatever you feel comfortable about, especially of those
things that Brathwaite approved. I assume that no one on this list would be
trying to make big bucks by bootlegging Brathwaite recordings. (I assume
that no one on this list would think they could make big bucks in this way,
but that's another issue.)

It's just that I've spent a lot of time working with composers who work
under a slightly different royalty situation than do writers, so I may
think about it differently than many people on this list.

As Jonathan Brannen posted elsewhere, when you're talking about something
with very little commercial potential, like spoken word or new music, how
royalties get distributed for recordings often has very little to do with
how many copies of something were sold.

To my mind, this makes the issue of what's right more important than what's
legal, but maybe I'm just funny that way. &, like I said earlier, I've
xeroxed and dubbed my share of copies and I'm sure I'll continue to do so
from time to time.

As to the Arrivants LPs; unless the record company screwed up big time on
filing the original copyright forms (to the extent that they were never
legally registered), they won't legally be in the public domain until long
after Brathwaite is dead.

As we all know, however, these recordings are long out of print, and it's
incredibly unlikely that they'll be reissued any time soon. So you be the
judge.

You've very eloquently described some of the value of having students
writing in the style of poems and poets they're studying. It's obviously a
good tool & you've gotten some really good results from it. It clearly can
help get at some levels of understanding (and misunderstanding) the writing
that may not be verbalized any other way.

My point's just that, unfortunately, there's lots of students for whom such
an exercise might be more frustrating than illuminating, and, far more
unfortunately, lots of teachers who wouldn't be able to draw useful lessons
from "unsuccessful" imitations as you have.

In the wrong situation(s), in the wrong hands perhaps, this teaching
technique could be dreadful, though. Just as some poets are "better" at
some kinds of poems than others, some teachers and some students are
"better" at some kinds of teaching and learning (not necessarily
respectively).

Believe me, I share your envy. But, as you obviously understand from the
teaching experiences you describe here, the issue in having students write
in the style of various writers isn't so they'll end up simply envying
these poet's skill.

Your last sentence has given me one more reminder to look at your book,
titled, I think, "at the dark end of the street," which I only know of from
a friend who likes Bob Kaufman's work a lot (& who, for a jazz oral history
project ended up interviewing, and pissing off, Bumps Blackwell's widow).

Re: Rainey's piece on HD (for Alan Golding): you should know that the
essay (now identified by someone else for Alan) was first given as an MLA
talk where Rainey was almost stoned for his attack.  The drawing of
battle lines is too bad because surely it should be possible to criticize
HD without using those particular arguments or lines of attack.

As for Vendler's title SOUL SAYS, in fact that isn't taken from Jorie
Graham as David Reynolds suggests but from George Herbert--can't remember
the name of the poem and there may be more than one but it goes along
with the typical Herbert strategy of Body vs. Soul speaking, or as in
"Love" ("Love says, "You shall be he").

Hey all,

A colleague and friend of mine is doing work on

        POETRY AND RADIO

as well as other forms of mechanical voice
reproduction and transmission, between the
twenties and the forties.  I don't know anything about the
subject, and I'm wondering if anybody here knows of
interesting collections or recordings related to
radio broadcasts of poetry in the period.

She is NOT a member of the Poetics list, and would

Thanks in advance for any response.

the blues vernacular term "jelly roll" for sex/vagina and its frequent
appearance w/ "soul" as rhyme word might suggest that cultures other than the
christianized northern european ones have long associated the soul, not only
with the body, but with its sexual functions among others.  not to claim that
other cultures don't have their own dualisms, but the body/soul one seems to
have had such a crippling and yet culturally forceful, and sometimes even
productive, effect on Northern Euro-American culture in particular.--md

sic: it was me, David Kellogg, and not David Reynolds, who said that.

And also: I'm sure the Herbert connection isn't lost on Vendler, for whom
it no doubt serves to reinforce her view of Graham as part of the great
Stream of Poetry, but in fact Vendler writes:

        "Lyric, from the Psalms to 'The Waste Land,' seemed, when I was
        seventeen, to be the voice of the soul itself.  This, I take it,
        is what Jorie Graham means in calling one of her poems 'Soul
        Says,' which I have borroed as the title for this collection of
        essays about lyric poetry."

                Vendler, *Soul Says*, p. 3

So while the title may be indirectly from Herbert -- one of Vendler's
favorite poets -- it's *directly* from Graham.  (The poem "Soul Says"
also provides the epigraph for Vendler's collection).

Cheers,
David

I think they are the same thing, just in different degrees. They're both=20

Herb,

I agree that when tapes of poetry readings are available for purchase
they should be purchased rather than dubbed.  Unfortunately, most
poetry readings aren't recorded, and of those that are, few are
available commercially.  I wouldn't distribute copies of a reading
I've taped without the poets consent and I assume that others who
exchange dubs of reading are also acting in good faith.  I think
because of the non-commercial nature of such recordings this is a
a fair assumption.  Poetry has to rely on informal and unofficial
means of distribution because most formal and official channels
are closed to it.  I also think it helps a poet extend her or his
audience and promotes the sales of books.

I have no problem with anyone making dubs of readings I've given
or photo-copying my out-of-print books for personal use.  I'd be
interested hearing how others view this in terms of their work.

So, the 'soul' is 'constructed'?

As 'identity' - 'culture' - 'language' - 'syntax' - 'metaphor' -
'materiality' - 'spirituality' - 'belief' - are at their least
'constructed'?

"....The phenomenon is that which shows itself, that which is

which can reveal itself therein only by remaining concealed beneath
the appearance. Something shows itself in the phenomenon and can show
itself there only by remaining hidden...." Henry Corbin, trans  Peter
Russell  "The concept of Comparative Philosophy. Golgonooza Press,
1981

The search for a location for the soul supposes that NOTHING is that
can be so concealed ( / revealed ).  EVERY THING must have a locus?
within Extension?  That sounds awfully like Descartes's problem of
mind/body  (  although  it is not the " mind "  that is the name for
what has  " passions ", it is the "Soul" that has "passions" in his
writings.

The concern I have here is that our "language environment" (remember
Tom Beckett's first number of The Difficulties, the "language
environment" questionnaire replied  to by various writers ) has
eliminated. largely, a very large thread of discourse. This results
I suppose from the Mind/Body dualities and problems of 16th/17th
century writing.  This thread is recoverable and is possibly crucial
to the fullest and widest and richest poetics so many of us on this
list evidently are moved to desire.  (It does not have to break into
any orthodox religious trot at the touch of James Joyce's wife's
whip).  It may be  situated within the continually pressing thought of
our living within our families, of generation, of succession, of
love (and anger and kindness and malice...)   and   I am reminded of
the effort to conceive of these relations also as animating the
behaviour of artists in their community, as clearly shown by Paul
Barolsky in his studies of Vasari's Lives

Oh, would that this were true.  People on this list not included, the
world that even thinks about Witt is about as microscopic as you can get,
and the continued proliferation of the dread disease, dichotomy mind,
is proof that his presence is but a trickle.  As a wittgen(stein)ian,
won't one go about asking what in fact we can and can't say about soul
to explore the boundaries of its possibility?

A couple of years back I was watching one of the lectures in Joseph
Campbell's _Transformation of Myth Through Time_ where he was talking about
the classical Vedic chakra system, which seems to make a distinction between
the "gross body" and the "subtle body", which I take to be rough equivalents
of what we commonly call "body" and "soul".  Neophytes are always
discovering the subtle body and wanting to negate the gross body, but,
Campbell said, this is missing the point, which is that the subtle body is
to be experienced _through_ the gross body.  So maybe the idea is really
old.  Or maybe Campbell had been reading Cixous.

Subject:      Re: Soul/body

   It just hit me that this discussion on the "soul" has skirted around
   a far more formidable (and perhaps familiar) terms, "the self" and
   ITS effectiveness, which poststructuralism and langpo may have ironized
   (at least in their blatant codifications). But the issue has not gone
   aaway as a site for many "responses" of varying degrees of emotional/
   intellectual/formal intensity (at least rhetorically). Perhaps because
   it is more perilous, it opens up the can of worms of art's relationship
   to life, and not in a merely abstract way, that life may be a poem and
   a poem only life and what then of the poet, the rimbaudian cork????
   tossing tossing, or willing willing, why not both? why not neither...
   and such "overcomplications of subjectivity" have a tendency allegedly
   to get in the way of the play of surfaces and the aestehtic distancing
   or, on the other hand, are accused of a certain aesthetic distancing
   by those who want the self as a given or ground, a donnee or readu-
   made, as both hardcore "straight" poets and hardcore "avant-garde"
   poetry (assuming either really exists as more than an impulse in the
   poems of most of us---cf. Zukofsky's "Shakespeare argued with no one,
   only in itself") beg the question that is the self, or the society
   or institution that takes the form as the "question which is the self"
   since there is a party in my mind and I hope it never stops, especially
   if one realizes that "to be alone in a crowd" (in the crowd that's
   also conceivably "inside one") may be the distance in which only
   thought can occur, emotionalizing intellect, the dramatizations that
   prefer to see the self strategically as a vista from which to criticize
   society cold and calculatingly even as it rages in a frustration
   beyond--or at least between-words....chris stroffolino

yeah, ron, great anecdote, meant to ask you, did your agent or translator or did
the journal itself propose in an introduction or some such a "vision" or
rationale for grouping the 3 of you together?  if so, what was it?

i once had students, in a class in which we were reading yeats, read woody's
spoof on the yeats norton headnotes in --is it without feathers? -one student,
from Cameroon, didn't understand that the piece was a joke and gave a
presentation on it as if it were a serious piece of anecdotal literary
biography.  and most students didnt even realize it was a spoof on yeats, even
though they'd read him in the norton anth. that was the object of satire.
anyway, that's minnesota for you --no sense of irony and play.--md

also, here's a proposal for community on the list (yes, the sad truth is, i'm a
die-hard addict by now --i gotta getta life!!):
 have local gatherings (mpls, buff, sfu, etc) of list people --i'm assuming this
might already be happening in places where there's more of a scene than here.
and then maybe how about a yearly list festival in some central place, buffalo
perhaps, or vancouver, where we all get to see what each other look like and
sound like in the embodied flesh?
or is that too corny?--md

I don't see any harm in telling what I know of the story, but I don't have
any juicy details and I doubt there really are any.

A Seattle writer, Paul de Barros (another one of those Seattle writers
whose creative work is published more in Canada than in the States)
produced an oral history of the Jazz scene in the Seattle area through the
mid-Sixties. (Jackson Street After Hours, published in 1994, by Sasquatch
Press.)

Blackwell was a band leader in the area from some time in the forties on.
He later was a record producer and/or manager  for various R&B performers.
Based on his research, de Barros made him less central to the Seattle jazz
scene in the completed book than his widow thought was appropriate.

It was only later that he found out that Blackwell's widow was one of Bob
Kaufman's sisters, but by then he knew from their previous communications
that he'd be unwelcome if he tried to explore the issue with her.

That's it, sorry it's so dull.

Subject:      free verse foot

Some time back Donald Wesling's "The Prosodies of Free Verse" was
mentioned as a good treatment of the subject. Finally found it in
TWENTIETH-CENTURY LITERATURE IN RETROSPECT, Harvard UP, Harvard
English Studies Series : No. 2, 1971.

So it's not exactly the latest thing.

There is this passage:

          Since, however, there is no free verse foot, and since it
          is strictly impermissible to alter typography in a genuine
          confrontation of all the linguistic features of the line,
          we must accept Zygmunt Czerny's axiom that each line in
          free verse is "quantitatively independent of the previous
          one" and Barbara Herrnstein Smith's that the line is "not
          a constant unit but the acknowledgement of a limit of
          variability." In fact, the line is the notation of how the
          poem is to be read.


I wonder if whoever recommended this essay, or anyone else, cares to
comment on those statements, especially on the assumption, "there is
no free verse foot."

How about, to use contemporary language, we try to talk about the self
by acknowledging the truth of (forgive the jargon:) "subject-positionality"
yet by going beyond that ideo-linguistic node?

Does anybody on the list know if madge herron is still writing?  Just saw
one of her poems in a wonderful collection--Love Poems by Women.  I used
to know her in London when I was doing a market stall in Camden
Town--very very long ago in my youthly youth.  Liked her a lot.  She once
told me she felt as though her face was hanging from her eyebrows.

Who made the eyes but I?
Truth lord, but I have marred them,

You must sit down, says Love, and taste my meat.
So I did sit and eat.

Mixed feelings re - copying for my own work. Basically for out-of-print
books and recordings of readings I'd encourage a proliferation of pirating.
Ye Olde Total Anti-Copyrighte Brigade. Would prefer drediting (it's a
lovely typo but I mean crediting before anyone gets a Judge joke edgeways)
but am also keen on anonymity and alias use. Guess if appropriation for
wanton profit was involved I'd like to be consulted.

Main bug is not so much the question of money as the question of abuse of
intention through manipulation of context.

Anyone read the post on Technocult  -  I'm curious about the implications
of their idea that a 'culture' could be copyrighted?

It harks back to an antique discussion but I'm of the opinion that work
produced in a format for which it was not composed is tantamount to a
translation. Hot example would be what happened to J.H. Prynne's wonderful
separate books in the mish-mash of the Allardyce Barnett collection. An
unappealling travesty of presentation. And maybe Herb this is part of the
discussion re - copying too. There's some curious and subtle demaractions
operating here and I thank you all for raising them.

Subject:      free verse foot

Some time back Donald Wesling's "The Prosodies of Free Verse" was
mentioned as a good treatment of the subject. Finally found it in
TWENTIETH-CENTURY LITERATURE IN RETORSPECT, Harvard UP, Harvard
English Studies Series : No. 2, 1971.

So it's not exactly the latest thing.

There is this passage:

          Since, however, there is no free verse foot, and since it
          is strictly impermissible to alter typography in a genuine
          confrontation of all the linguistic features of the line,
          we must accept Zygmunt Czarny's axiom that each line in
          free verse is "quantitatively independent of the previous
          one" and Barbara Herrnestein Smith's that the line is "not
          a constant unit but the acknowledgement of a limit of
          variability." In fact, the line is the notation of how the
          poem is to be read.


I wonder if whoever recommended this essay, or anyone else, cares to
comment on those statements, especially on the assumption, "there is
no free verse foot."

Been gone most of the summer, but came back to find this latest interesting
discussion on the "soul." I'm wondering if "soul"  is exactly what we do not
have at this point. The main thing that cont. conditions make impossible.
"The cry of the soul in a soulless world (sic)," doesn't mean that there
is not a soul out there, in here, but that it is irrelevant. Might as
well have a dodo residing in your abdomen.

But if we do not have a "soul" neither do we have a "body."

Does anyone know anything about Marguerite Duras? I just
finished two novellas by her and an interview.  What I'm curous
abt is Alberto Manguel's observation that she is viewed as
a "best-seller" by the French "intelligentsia". And, secondly,
her relationship to Coach House Press and its ilk. Fine writer, I
thought, with fine language. Thanks.

sexual it is, but the person to whom this stanza meant everything is the
anti-sexual, fatally anorexic Simone Weil.  it was her favorite piece of

Maybe everybody just reads too quickly on this line.  My post said that
any tape I offer to dub for someone is either in the public domain or was
made by me with the author's permission.  I never said or suggested that
the LPs of the Arrivants had passed into the public domain.  That should
leave one clear option, no?

If, by the way, anyone is willing to pay big bucks, or get their
University library to do so, the Library of Congress can dub you a tape
of Brathwaite's quite lengthy reading there, introduced by Anthony Hecht
(?!?!?@@#), which is where I first met EKB.

For the jazz fans -- Pacifica Archive has a 58 minoute tape of a parking
lot interview with John Coltrane, just about a year before Coltrane's
death.  It goes for $10.00 and is known to the Archive as A3-BC1266 --
You can order from Pacifica Radio Archive -- P.O. Box 8092 - Dept. K -
Universal City, CA - 91608-0092.  $3.80 shipping charge.  (It goes down
as you order more cassettes, so you might ask fro their current list of

Ron, thanks for the tips.  It will take me some time to find out if

for, their, etc.  correct above as needed --

Yesterday, Marjorie told me of a review of the Hoover PostMod anthology
in the current New Criterion by John Haines,,,, a more than usually
amusing bit of stupidity -- His question is, since Post Mod means anybody
after Modernism, where"s Anne Sexton, James Wright, etc. -- but, of
course, he does not ask where certain other poets born subsequent to
modeernism (_and_ modernism_) might have been left off--  Following this
logic, we might well ask why Edwin Markham has been so consistenly absent
from anthologies of Modernism, despite his clearly having been alive
during the Modernist period  (actually, you'd be surprised at some of the
Modernists who _did_ read Markham).

But then, I expect any day now to hear a ganster rap version of Markham's
"The Man with the Hoe."  what goes around, etc . . .

        probably one of the reasons she's a "best-seller" is that she's
also a filmmaker, and many of her films are versions of her plays and
novels, which always makes the latter sell.  I'm thinking of that movie
THE LOVER that she didnt direct but which was based on her book of same
name.
after that a new edition of the book came out w/ a gross glossy picture
from the movie on its cover.  (also she wrote the script to the wonderful
Resnais film HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR that i'm going to watch right now.)--brian

tho the poem may be "read" in lines, reading across them, i.e.
enjambment is nevertheless still a [necessary] option and breathing
can plainly happen in mid-line, as in the Olson piece from Maximus I
quoted for Loss Glazier going to Gloucester.  I think it is more
important at all times to hear a beat going against which the verses
are spoken, so that the ground/constant (heart, according to Pound)
can be felt, while all manner of running over and syncopation takes
place, because of the irregular way that spoken language is sounded.
The worst assumption would be that the stresses in the verse (where
they are found to be strong weak and indeterminate as in most
prosodic divisions) must be regularised and MUST correspond to "the
beat".

No, I'm not gonna put the blame on the word.  It's Helen Vendler I'd have no
patience for.  Except I'm not familiar with her.

I'm with Reginald on this (though I can certainly understand Rod's feelings
on the subject):  really, if we're gonna talk about this, we're going to
have to be more careful to listen to each other with an ear toward trying to
understand what is meant when one person uses the word as opposed to
another, because there are very fine lines and subtleties involved rather
than one monolithic "meaning" that has to be accepted or rejected.
Otherwise we could just have a polemics-fest based on reductive readings of
each other's posts, which won't be useful to any of us.

The John Haines review (I didn't even know he was a poet) is truly
astonishing, even for New Criterion.  Ashbery is dismissed as
"gibberish," Olson as "nonsense" and "posturing" and so on, down the
line.  And he sounds so self-confident.

Maria: "Love" in Herbert's Love, clearly Christ, no?  Love is the gentle
and polite host, who 'forgives" the sinning guest and offers him the
Eucharist--"you must sit down, said Love, and taste my meat. / So I did
sit and eat."  Conversion parable.  If you want to see it as sexual, well
sure, communion can always be interpreted that way but I think it's
slightly far fetched.  (it seems to me we've had this conversation...)

Dear Herb,
        The subject seems to have run its course, but here's an addendum.
.Yep, students should write poetic essays in their courses. That's what I
say. Poetic means having one.  My doubts, the problem, is with the
institutional norm, the expository essay--what is it good for? Absolutely
nothing. Say it again.  Isn't contemporary poetics  shaped by resistance to
the poetics of everyday essay assignments among other language products?
Aren't they, isn't it?

Coffee House is also publishing, next year I believe, a collected writings

overall, there's a press I can't quite figure -- but then I tend to like

Burt, I remember reading Herbert as a grad student, and there was ample
discussion of ecstatic communion with Christ being presented as a sexual
communion. I wouldn't even call it "sexual overtones" as you suggest. I
think it's pretty obvious in the poem you quote and others. And it seems
there is a fairly wide literature about religion as sexual ecstasy, and I'm
certain there have been commentaries on Herbert taking this issue on.
Seems to me that when the object of desire is Christ, the sexual
communion is bound to have homosexual overtones. I'm sorry I'm not a
student in the field and can't give you citations, but I'm sure someone on
this list can.

This is not news, as others have circled the same point, but I think
W's response would be to ask what the word means in the specific
language games in which it is used.

I think his impatience with metaphysics extended to skepticism as
well, in so far as skepticism is a kind of negative metaphysics.

I guess it depends on what you mean by "foot" and by "free verse". The
combination of these two terms here suggests to me a response to
tradtional verse forms in which the length of the line is determined
by the accretion of a regular number of syllabic units and stresses.
In this particular case, Wesling seems to want to leave the word there
in that traditional significance, so that he can use it to make
specific distinctions with irregular verse forms.

I don't think there's any reason you have to, though. Prosody ain't
metaphysics, though they tend to treat it like that over on the CAP-L
list. If you follow W.C. Williams' thinking (and though I know some
others don't treat it as actual thinking--notably the Wintersian
rearguard--I do) then the "foot" gets kicked into the 20th century,
where, along with all other forms of measurement, it becomes variable,
in which case it can be applied meaningfully to irregular verse forms.
In Williams' case he uses it as equivalent to his line. But you don't
have to leave it there, either.

I mean it comes to us from the Greeks who used it as a measure of
duration. The English changed it into a measure of stress (first known
use listed in the OED dated at 1050). Williams tried to push it toward
a measure of the fundamental rhythmic units which constitute the
founding sense of colloquial speech. Good luck trying to fix it
somewhere.

Early Duras is excellent, especially the novels _Un barrage contre le
Pacifique_, Le ravissement de Lol. V. Stein_ & _Le marin de
Gibraltar._ Early success was indeed due to the par_Moderato
Cantabile_ & _Detruire dit-elle_. The big fame
came of course with _The LOvers_, the book, which was a major
bestseller, but not the movie. There is a selected Duras out in
English, called _Outside_ (Beacon Press, 1986)Her fame, at least in
France, is also connected with her antics as war-time friend of
Francois Mitterand, & with her phenomenal bouts with alcolism. (cf.
the book one of her companions, Yann Andrea, wrote on her drying out,
under the title _M.D._)
        What I prefer of her writing -- besides the early novels -- are
smaller texts, before all _The Malady of Death_ (translated by Barbara
Bray, Grove Press 1986). A good entrance into that text & in to her
work in general is the second part of Maurice Blanchot's _The
Unavowable Community_ (Station Hill Press, 1988, translated by your
humble servant).

Subject:      free verse foot

Didn't mean to post my first message twice; I had received some sort
of electronic rejection message the first time I sent it, a day
before, and thought it never went through.

I am still hoping for more opinions on whether or not there is such
a thing as a free verse foot. I myself lean towards the syncopation
idea, with Pound's "The Return" as the pre-eminent example. As I
state it, this view may seem Jesuitical to many on this list, but I
think that it made a great deal of difference that Williams and
cummings started out, as adolescents, imitating Keats; that Pound's
proclamation, "no Tennysonianess," was based on a good acquaintance
with what he rejected; that even Ginsberg tried to write like Allen
Tate to start with; that Denise Levertov grew up immersed in English
accentual-syllabics; that way on back H. D. and Amy Lowell felt even
more constrained and oppressed by the poetic heritage than did T. E.
Hulme and Ford Madox Ford.

Maybe if I quote Mallarme it won't seem so offensive to say, "Je
dirai que la reminscence du vers strict hante ces jeux a cote et leur
confere un profit." [No way to do diacritical marks here.] I think
Eliot got his "haunting" theory of f.v. from this statement.

Just because a question has been debated for a hundred years is no
reason to quit discussing it. Chronological parochialism.
Time-blinkering. Intellectual life of the sea-anemone.

Marjorie: this is a fine point, but it was someone else who asked about the
(homoerotic) sexual overtones of the poem.  i was the one who responded by
saying it was Simone Weil's favorite piece of lit.  But, that said, i do think
there's validity to the now-forgotten-who-it-was person's question.  Yes, we
have had this conversation re Stein; i think things are sexual, you think that's
possible but far-fetched.  that conversation led to my favorite chapter in my

hiya rod, yes, david henderson and i wrote essays for it.  i only henderson's
advertized in the catalogue tho.  so i'm not sure what the scoop is.  mine was
a rewrite of the kaufman chapter in dark end of the street. the book is the
entirety of golden sardine, which is, incredibly, out of print, a few selected
from his new directions books, and a handful of previously uncollected poems.
yeah, i'm gonna snatch it up when it appears.--md

i've found this a great text to teach, esp in connection with the master/slave
dialectic...  wasn't it dictated, rather than written, because she was too out
of it (alcoholically) to hold a pen?  amazing, that it shd come out of an

I feel like one of those students in a class who leans forward listening
all semester but doesn't say anything for so long it becomes almost
physically impossible to force her voice out into the air.  Here I am,
though, delurking to enter the recording angel stream.  It was me, way
back, who offered--wrongly--to dub a tape which may still be available
commercially and which therefore may still be providing the poet and the
folks who taped him and made his sounds available some much deserved
revenue.  I apologize.

I appreciate the postings by Herb Levy, Jonathan Brannen, Aldon Nielson,
and others.  My offer to dub the tape came not from greed or
wilful criminality (she said defensively & no doubt unnecessarily) but
from haste and thoughtlessness.  It also came, I know, from a long
history of teaching and writing about and wanting to read and listen to
writers whose work has been/is out of print and unavailable through
commercial channels.  Whenever I can, I order in-print books for my
classes--of course--but I have also (are the feds listening here?  I'll
confess anyway) xeroxed bits on Stein from The Language Book without
writing away and paying a fee (or more accurately passing on to my
students a fee) for them, passed around a frayed xerox of The Bedouin
Hornbook, and copied an H.D. text published only in an out-of-sight
expensive ($375) art-book format.  For this reason, I'm deeply grateful
to Doug Messerli for the Sun & Moon anthology which makes so many
hard-to-find poems available and for Sun & Moon's intent to bring Mackey's
Hornbook into print, and for all the other small presses
and journals which keep this work circulating.

As teacher and critic, I feel an important aspect of my role is as
disseminator: to unblock access, to open things up, to
scatter widely.  Although xeroxing an out-of-print
poem may not profit in the writer or publisher in the short term, it has
long term effects crucial for all of us: it generates
readers/listeners/buyers/thinkers for books, recordings, anthologies,
journals, and performances, etc.  My bottom line, I guess, is the more
people who think about this stuff, the better.

Thanks to Herb Levy and the rest of the commenters in this stream, I see
I need to be more alert and careful in this dissemination, however--.  I
remain . . .

you must go to grolier's, on plympton st. in harvard square. legendary poetry
book store with cool lady and dog.  greet the dog as jessica pumpkin (or the
less formal "jessie p") and the lady will be nice to you. also the
busch-reisinger museum in harvard square and the gardner museum in boston.  both
very lovely, small museums (i hate big ones).  my dad used to work at the
peabody museum on "divinity" ave in cambridge, in the antrho dept, and they had
some cool mummies on the top floor.  but i think they were removed cuz they were
drawing "inappropriate" interest.  that museum has a collection of glass flowers
made by some french brothers, which are supposed to be extraordinary, but i;ve
blocked them from my memory because of the innumerable times i was dragged to
see them in tow with my parents and their visitors from out of town.  the cafe
algiers, in the brattle street building, is a long loved place of mine, though
it used to be funkier, underground, full of chess-playing pretensious wanna be
writers ("joyce is the only other writer as dedicated wordplay and etymologies,"
one said to me once when i was about 17.  other than whom, i asked.  well, me,
he replied), and plo supporters.  now it's more ordinary, but still a point of
nostalgia for me.

as for anthologies, i wasn't on the list at the time of the discussion, but i'm
spozed to give a talk at mla on that subject.  anyone care to recap the major
aspects of the discussion?  or, how cn i get hold of the "transcripts"
thereof?--md

               Reinvigorating apparently stranded terminology (of which we

intriguing functions. In the process poetry can sensitise agendas that have

The MFA in Nonfiction Writing program at Iowa has just this morning been
notified that we've been allotted three Patricia Roberts Harris fellowships
for minority students to enroll in August, so I'm writing to ask if
anyone knows of a writer who might be interested in applying.

The MFA in Nonfiction Writing is not connected with the Writers Workshop
but with the Iowa English Department.  It's a relatively small program
(about 12-15 entering students a year) for people who want to
concentrate on writing nonfiction essays. It's a two-and-a-half year
commitment ending in a thesis (a book of nonfiction essays).  The people
teaching in the program include Patricia Foster, Tom Simmons, Paul Diehl, Carl
Klaus, and Susan Lohafer; visitors have included Patricia Hampl, Terry
Tempest Williams, Gerald Early, etc.  The students are generally older, some
come from a publishing background, some are experienced writers, most are
people who've written at night after their regular job is over and want to see
what it would be to follow out a writing life.

The PRH fellowships offer a 12-month stipend for $14,400 plus (I think)
tuition.  If you know of anyone who would be interested, have him/her
contact Paul Diehl (319/335-0473 or 319/338-5754) or e-mail me at the
above address or call (319/354-0492) ASAP.  At such short notice,
people can apply by faxing a creative nonfiction writing sample and a short
letter.  Since everything here shuts down by August 4th to start
again August 21st, we'd have to make decisions in ten days or so.

If you know of anyone who might qualify--i.e. is a passionate and
committed writer interested in nonfiction essays and a person of
color--let them know as soon as possible..

        Thanks,

                Dee--

Subject:      Re: Grolier Books & the Perils of Essentialism

I want to second Maria Damon's suggestion about Grolier's in Cambridge and
make an additional suggestion that you always ask for anything you can't
find there.

Everything isn't in one alphabetical order in the general shelves. There
are a number of special interest areas (for example some, but not all,
geographic areas, ethnic groups, styles, and languages have their own
shelves) which aren't always easily marked, but where you can often find
books that don't seem to be there.

I was there soon after Robin Blaser's Holy Forest was published and it
wasn't in the general section, it wasn't in the Gay section, but there were
several copies in the Canadian section. I don't remember if all of Edmond
Jabes books were in the French section or the Jewish section, but he was
only in one or the other. What gets stocked in the Language poetry section
seems often to be determined more by a book's publisher than anything else.


This can be frustrating, but once you know to ask the number of books
available at Grolier's nearly doubles.

Barone and Peter GAnick's. I'd be interested in reviews of any and all of
these that any of you might come across. (I know Hank Lazer's piece in Con.
Lit., something from TLS, a Thom Gunn review in Threepenny Review.)

On tapes: the taping thread prompted me to mention something you might find of
use/interest. At the Twentieth-Century Lit. Conference here, we videotape the
keynote readings, talks, and performances, and copies are available for
non-commercial use (the authors have signed a release) at around 10 or 15
bucks. So there's some spectacular performances from recent years from Charles
Bernstein, Susan Howe, David Antin, Clayton Eshleman, Ed Dorn, just to mention
a few likely to be of particular interest to this list. Also Sherley Anne

Charles, Susan, and David are particular faves of mine.

Subject:      Re: the politics of dub

For the sake of a bit more than argument I'd like to take an anarchist stance
on this issue. I don't think our lurker friend should feel guilty for
offering to copy that tape. The technology exists, she has the tape, she cld
get it to M.D. as easy or perhaps easier than he cld order it. It is also
quite possible that hearing this tape wld cause listener(s) to buy books they
might not otherwise have bought.

The Grateful Dead encourages bootlegging of their music-- it ain't hurt them.
They've been consistently one of the top grossing bands since the late '80s.
Bob Dylan hates bootlegging-- but I think he has benefited from it as he
doesn't release his best work (or rarely)-- people can find out just how good
he is from bootlegs & maybe buy more albums &/or go to concerts as a result.
(He's worth seeing agn by the way, just plain didn't care for a while there).
This seems to me true of less commercial work as well. I know people have
bought books by poets that I've taped for them they would not otherwise have
bought. The propaganda goes that one is taking money out an artist's pocket
when one makes a copy. I don't think that's the way artists end up making
money. They do it largely via garnering reputation which eventually receives
monetary reward (usually institutional). You're not likely to garner anything
if people can't encounter yr work.

There are trickier questions here too which Cris C articulated well. But to
take it even further-- Why is a performance of music not as much the
"property" of the people in the room as of the musicians. It is a collective
consensual experience after all, & should be recognized as such. To get more
to the heart of it I think is that there seems some idea that there will be
justice if the rules are followed. Ain't with that. The rules are written by
a ruling elite in their interest, they will be the ones to profit when the
rules are followed. Personally, that curbs my enthusiasm for following the
rules. Kathy Acker's mess over 4 pages of Harold Robbins' which was
substantially altered is an example of this. (She has an excellent piece in
the first _Postmodern Culture_ (available via e-mail
pmc@jefferson.village.virginia.edu. it's indexed as ACKER.99) abt this that
actually also bears very interestingly on the soul thing (what abt "spirit"
anyway, let's be bald abt it, o no, maybe I've started it up agn)).

I'm NOT making a case for Pirating, I hope that's obvious.I'm not sure it is
tho,  maybe I'm arguing for A COMMUNITY OF PIRATES THAT HAVE BRAINS. However
_selling_ other artists materials w/out their consent is not what I'm
referring to. Making it available to others where it otherwise wld not be (at
no profit to the provider) is what I'm talking abt. So I don't see, in the
end, any valid moral or economic arguments against using my tape dubbing
system as I please. Or, for that matter my desktop xerox (which I just got,
FREE. Ha!) I am after all lucky enough, i.e. priveleged enough to have access
to a lot of cultural materials, which NEED to be shared, I think. If for any
reason anyone has a tape of my work they want to copy or wants to xerox
something, go for it. (Actually there are a few readings I've done I know
were taped that I never got copies). But the work, IT'S NOT MINE ANYWAY, &
I'm not sure it ever was.

Marjorie,

I was the one who suggested the sexual - Herbert connection.  But of
course the conversion thing--yet, how does sitting fit into that concept?

I of course can imagine eating (eucharist).

On the subject of free or enslaved verse and feet:

I just in the mail today got a copy of :

RETHINKING METER: A NEW APPROACH TO THE VERSE LINE by Alan Holder,
Bucknell UP.

I won't go through the entire jacket copy, but here are some snatches of it:
"the committment to the foot as a measure satisfies ad desire for a poem to
display a system"
"But that system is achieved only at the cost of [etc.]"
Holder "discards the approach" whereby on the one hand there is the ideal
line and on the other the actual line and the reader apprehends a tension"
[that was a paraphrase]
i.e., Holder's approach avoids a dualism.
also the book criticizes previous theoretical approaches including those
purporting to be non-dualistic.
Holder finally discards the notion of meter altogether and thus approaches
the line not through the foot but the phrase. Yet H. still feels that the
"line" is what marks poetry from prose.
He draws on linguistics among other disciplines to make his argument.

I would imagine Holder is looking for reviewers. He can be reached
for whatever reason at the Dept of English, Hunter College, CUNY,
695 Park ave., NYC 10021, USA.

Charles,

I can see the sex-religious thing in the Middle aGes before Luther than
in Herbert's time (I'm thinking now of Boswell's book on same-sex early
and mid Middle Ages religious ceremonies--though I will have to say that
the book is controversial, but Boswell had a good rep. over all; I'
haven't read it but heard him on the radio one day, very convincing.)


anyway, thanks. maybe you (we) are right.

Subject:      KennyG's Home Page/Visual Poetry
Comments: cc: wr-eye-tings@sfu.ca

To those of you interested in visual poetry:

I have been sending gif files to Kenny Goldsmith and he has been putting
them up on his home page. At the moment I am the only person he has listed
under visual poetry. I need some company! And I know Kenny wants a bigger
selection, or should I say, he wants a selection. Sooooo, I am encouraging
people to send him their work.

You may want to check out the page first. The address is:
http://wfmu.org/~kennyg/

If you don't have a graphics browser, like Netscape, you can get his page
but you won't get the visual files.

I am on a Mac and I'm not sure who else is. My procedure is to bring my
work into photoshop and make the necessary adjustments for the home page
there, then save the piece as a gif. After that I send it to Kenny as an
attachment.

Photoshop is the only program I know of that will save a file as a gif,
which I think is better than jpeg. I have written quite a few things in
Quark Xpress.  Unfortunately one cannot bring a Quark eps into Photoshop
with any degree of success. Contrary to what one would think, eps is not a
universal format. This means anything I want to put on the web that I have
written in Quark will need to be recreated in another program. For me, that
would be Adobe Illustrator. Illustrator eps's are compatible with Photoshop
and come in with no problem. You can work on an Illustrator file in
Photoshop should you so desire.

Failing that, a person can scan in a visual poem and save it as a gif in
photoshop. However the file will no doubt be larger than a file created
directly on the computer.

Once in Photoshop

1. Save your document.
2. Under Image choose Image Size and set the Resolution to 72 pixels/inch.(OK)
3. Under Mode choose Indexed Color and set the Resolution to 8 bits, the
Palette                        to Adaptive Color and the Dither to
Diffusion.(OK)
4. Save as CompuServe Gif.
5. Send as an attachment to Kenny.

Backchannel me (blairsea@panix.com)if you have any questions or problems.
Backchannel Kenny (kgolds@panix.com) if you want to know more about the
home page etc.

I might mention here that poems configured on the unix bulletin boards
directly, will hold there formatting if I print them out directly from the
list, but lose their formatting when I save them to my hard drive and try
to print them out in teachtext or MS Word.

This happened today when I tried to print out a post of Karl Young's with a
poem made by configurations of the word love, with an emphasis on evol. I
believe it is by bpNichol whose work I know only through these lists.
Luckily I still had the poem on my mail list and was able to print it
correctly.

Sweet dreams

Blair

PS - I forgot to say that if you are scanning in images, scan them in at a
higher resolution that 72 dpi. If possible try 300 dpi or if not 200 dpi,
then after you have saved your doc in Photoshop, reduce the resolution in
image size to 72 pixels. Keep the size at 100%. This will improve the
quality of your image.

Goodnight.

I think there is no *single* "free verse foot", though each poem or section
or line of free verse poetry has obviously some patternable collection of
beats (anyone read Jim Rosenberg's recent post of his "Notes Toward a
Non-linear Prosody of Space"?), that it sets up, ad-hoc, as it were.  I'm
not sure why it's impermissable to alter typography (whose permission does
one have to obtain?), though, or how this would constitute a genuine
confrontation of all the linguistic features of the line, so the two axioms
have to be withheld until someone can explain it to me.

Great! I've taken a look and like what I see. I'm about to start
putting a new work on the Web as a series of GIFs (since page design
is important to it, and GIFs are a whole lot more accessible and
compact than Postscript or just about anything else), and will
contact him about linking to it.

For what it's worth: I'm developing mine in Word for Windows. Once a
page is done, I use a screen capture program, SuperClip (available
from the SimTel mirror archives) to grab the window. I then trim it
to a consistent 375x490 pixels in SuperClip, save it as a GIF, then
go into LView and convert the GIF to B&W. The resulting GIFs are
running about 8 or 9 K.

Ryan, You remind me of one of my favorite arrangements:  the empty apartment
up in Escanaba (effectively a pre-life now, it seems) before the furniture
arrived.  Not what you are getting at, I know.  But is was my favorite or
among my favorite arrangements.  Felt abundant, as do many such reversals.

But as for aleatory, I might propose creating a nice tone row of your
liking, then assigning notes of the scale (chromatic, of course) to various
objects and then placing them in a row.

of course, there's always the old favorite of drawing numbers from a hat (or
crayons - but not on a warm day and not in Phoenix) and determining a nice
little chancy order in which things can be allowed to land and be awhile.

I've just gotten off a plane from LAX, which I'll blame for this odd little

I liked Haines' Wesleyan books in the 60s mildly. His neocon side (like
that of Roger Shattuck, who had one very interesting book of neosurreal
poems during that decade also) had not yet emerged. The New Criterion
is quite amazing, particularly given Hilton's stance that the function
of modernism was to establish standards and that this is the proper
role of the critic.

Are there not "feet" in all prosody? Free verse means not being
artificially bound by a set pattern thereof. Again, to recall McClure
sending his students off to the zoo to "scan the lions"...

I remember hearing this from a student who did a presentation on it in class.
she had the information from an article on duras, or from, as i recall, reviews

There is no collected writings and I'm not sure what's still in print but
a good university library--or even public library--should have two of her
more interesting pieces: The Days of Mars: A Memoir, 1940-46 (about
living through WWII in London) and The Heart to Artemis: A Writer's
Memoirs (about her life as a writer and dedicated to "my master, Stephane
Mallarme").  Unlike Mallarme, as you no doubt know, she mostly wrote
historical novels: Ruan, Gate to the Sea, Roman Wall, The Player's Boy,
The Fourteenth of October.  She also founded, edited, and wrote for Close
Up, one of the first journals of avant-garde cinema & theory, which can
be located in university libraries in microfilm.  Her poetry is here and
there in little journals of the twenties and thirties but never gathered, at
least that I know of. She also wrote a pretty interesting early
developmental novel called "Two Selves," part of which is a fierce attack
on education in England.

blind, my stuff is drab in this respect.  I like S. Murphy's jet=lagged
idea to draw numbers or use cards, but I don't have any.  My most
recent notion is to arrange my furniture and kitchen as I do
my books: alphabetically.  This is very arbitrary and Nicholesque.
Moreover, when bumping about in the dark, or in a stupor, or for fun,
I can navigate by touch translated to letter.  Ah, my couch==my coffe
table must be behind me.  Or, did I call it a chesterfield when
I was setting up shop? I think I will now backtrack to bed. Goodnight all.

I haven't used chance to produce "final outcomes" in my work for a very long
time, but I use chance as an indispensable "precompositional" aid, permuting
reservoirs of words as part of a process of making "prompt sheets" that I
write from to produce the final outcome.  The program that I use to do this is
a simple portable C program; it assumes as units whatever text is between
blank lines, and pseudo-randomly permutes these.  If anyone has any use for it,
send me E-mail and I'll send it to you.

Umm, Marjorie (and all the other folks wondering this) please *read* section
I.3 of the article I posted here not so many days ago called "Notes Toward a
Non-linear Prosody of Space."  It contains a very detailed and specific
proposal for how a concept of free-verse foot can be constructed.  I do
prefer a new term (I use 'measure') over foot, precisely because foot does
have so much baggage.  If you believe that the concept presented there is not
viable, I would be *delighted* to hear the argument.

The ideas in the first part of that article are well over 20 years old.  I
remember giving a workshop on this at Mark Linnenathal's (sp?) class at the
Poetry Center in S.F.  A couple of days later I spoke to one of the students
who was there.  He said that as I was talking, he was saying to himself "well
that all sounds nice but surely he can't be talking about poets like, say,
*Creeley*."  Then we *scanned* Creeley.  He said it blew his mind.  A couple
of the names of students I remember from that class were Keith Shein and Ted
Pearson.  (I think Beverly Dahlen was there too, but am not sure.)

I cant believe, all these years later, that some readers (listeners?)

feet cannot dance the way WCW describes his dancing in Book V) That

rtooms, put all the big things in one room till it is full, and thern
middle sized things in the next one, etc. If you have enough rooms
the last one will just have the salt shaker in it, and that is

Well, in fact there are those who see much more of a continuum between
Tractatus and PI, among them my erstwhile teacher Peter Winch.  The
argument is something like--and since it is more than 20 years since I
was immersed in this, forgive me for rusty hinges--even at the early
stage of the Tr, Witt was pursuing an internal logical investigation of
what is and what is not possible.  It was in fact an investigation of
the logical workings of language even at that stage and not an empiricist
attempt to splice language to the world.  E.g., 6.37 There is no
compulsion making one thing happen because another has happened.  The
only necessity that exists is _logical_ necessity.  Or 6.43 If the good
or bad exercise of the will does alter the world, it can alter only the
limits of the world, not the facts--not what can be expressed by means of
language.//In short the effect must be that it becomes an altogether
different world.  It must, so to speak, wax and wane as a whole.//The
world of the happy man is a different one from that of the unhappy man.

This, to me, gets dangerous again--as though the ideas like things exist
somehow within language but independent of it.  Back to the private

We speak in wonderful metaphors (I'm getting pictures of ideas like
puppies waiting for an owner to come home).  It only gets tricky if one
starts taking the metaphor seriously and concretizing it and using it to
explain the world.  Look at how people make theories out of their
feelings, then concretize the theories and make the world fit their
feelings.  It is possible to say "ideas are in the air."
That's one of the things we can say about ideas.  What does that mean,
though, about the world?

All that talk about Bruce Andrews organizing his books by the colors of
their covers reminded me of another non-alphabetic cataloging system.

When I was in college, a friend kept his records in order of date of
composition (or, in the case of jazz, pop, or world music, date of
recording). Since he was interested in most kinds of music, this made for
some nice juxtapositions.

For instance, which Be-bop records were made around the same time as
Messiaen was writing Quartet for the End of Time, which (western) classical
pieces composed around the time of the Ramayana Monkey Chant (not, by the
way, a traditional work, but a contemporary composition from the early 20th
century), etc.

Jim Rosenberg is right. Forget my  previous comments.

Clearly, any poem that has had this kind of effect on any reader, has
helped that reader to develop their own reading/perceiving techniques in a
manner analogous to a musical etude as an exercise as practise for a
particular performance "problem."

On free verse foot:  I strongly recommend Henri Meschonnic's THEORIE DU
RYTHME, unfortunately not yet translated, but about to be I think.  What
HM teaches us is that prosody most always be historicized:  one period's
"verse" is another's "prose" etc.  Now , yes, of course Creeley's poetry
can be scanned in the sense that you can count stresses (and slacks) per
line, talk about secondary sound features like alliteration, assonance,
consonance, rhyme, and come up with very definite patterns--but "foot"
implies a fixed metrical unit so I do agree with Jim that "measure" is
better but even that's not totally adequate.

I think a big project right now should be to look more closely at period
style today and determine why just about every poet on this net and other
interesting, innovative poets don't write metered verse or even free
verse, in a Williams-Creeley sense but write what's much closer to
Skeltonics or doggerel on the one hand, prose on the other and the sense
of "music" has dramatically shifted in, say, the last 20 years .  That
might be a more fruitful avenue of investigation (i.e., historicize) than
to try to define "the foot" or "the measure" which, as Meschonnic shows,
can never quite be done.

Thanks for the great feedback Gabrielle. I'm not stuck on the position I
presented (or maybe I am) but for the sake of the network of standard
stoppages I'll spin out a "defense."

Key to the differences we might have I think is this passage:
I wrote:
>. . .Which points to possibilities, that the ideas are already
> extant, within language, within contexts. . .

You responded:
 >This, to me, gets dangerous again--as though the ideas like >things exist

>image and solipsism.

I don't see how what I wrote cld be construed as taking a position which
implied the formulation "within language but somehow independent of it." What
I wrote seems to me to be saying pretty much what the Hejinian quote I cited
is saying.  Which is precisely that ideas are not private (subjective), but
rather contextual (intersubjective), in ways we don't entirely understand--
thus the "in the air" formulation. A more accurate formulation is probably
not possible because no context is _ultimately_ defineable, because all
contexts are interrelated. This is a bit of Buddhist propaganda, but it seems
to me useful. (I'm not arguing that there's never enough information in a
given situation to act, merely that there are always more elements which
could be taken into account). To boil it down perhaps what I'm saying is that
every idea is an interaction. That the "heart of an idea" is not locatable
"except in its use"!

It seems to me the viability of this articulation is only apparent precisely
when it is concretized. A good example of this is Cage's process in his later
writings such as _Themes & Variations_ , _I-VI_, & "Art Is Either A Complaint
Or Do Something Else." In this series he tried, & I think he often succeeded,
"to find a way of writing which though coming from ideas is not about them;
or is not about ideas but produces them." The manner in which he did this is
outlined in the introduction to _I-VI_ and in the interview w/ Joan Retallack
in _Aerial 6/7_, among other places. Briefly, it involved subjecting a source
text (or texts) to chance operations which then presented him with a mix of
source materials in which he then searched for ideas, eliminating materials
which allowed them to emerge. These were not necessarily semantic "ideas" but
could as well be "musical"-- i.e. related to the sound and texture, the
movement of language, as well as to the making of statements, obviously they
are always in some sense both of these.

Though one need not cite Cage to illustrate my point. Ashbery's "floating
pronouns" in a poem like "These Lacustrine Cities," or
Mallarme's famous "All Thought emits a Throw of the Dice" ("Tout Pensee emet
un Coup de Des") can't figure how to get diactical markings on this new
keyboard)), relate to what I'm saying.  More recently Carla Harryman's "Toy
Boats" in _Poetics Journal 5_ seems to me an excellent articulation of the
ways of thinking about these issues I'm forwarding. She writes: "I am an
indication of what occurs around me." & also, beautifully, "Both belief and
denial throw existence into question." She ends the piece with the following
paragraph: "A structure for writing that comes from anticipation relative to
an elsewhere, which to become a somewhere-- i.e., a writing --must borrow
from the things of this world in their partiality."

So, that's what I think right now. To respond to a few other points-- I
suspect that the idea of a schism in Wittgenstein's thought is based
partially in the events of his life, & I don't think that's an entirely bogus
point of view. In retrospect we can see the seeds of the late thought in the
early but there does seem an openness to a less proscriptive investigation in
the later work I think. It seems to me in the _Tractatus_ that he, like Pound
for so long, wanted to make it cohere.

Also you wrote:
> Look at how people make theories out of their
feelings, then concretize the theories and make the world fit >their
feelings.

It's become a bit of a cliche to say, but I'm not sure in the end we can
distinguish between emotion & intellect. That perhaps an oversimplification,
and if I were a scientist I might not say that. However, I was reading in
Alan Ryan's biography of Dewey
last night-- Dewey argued that "what scientists do when they try to
understand the world is not very different from what any of us do when we try
to decide what to do or think"-- this _feels_ right to me. (Dewey eschewed
both violent revolution & acceptance of the status quo in favor of the slogan
"Intelligent Action!" & although tagged "pragmatist" prefered the term
"experimentalism" -- i.e. find out what works and do that. Chomsky went to a
Deweyite school in Philadelphia til the age of 12.)

& finally (I didn't expect this to be such a long post, geeze, now I have to
keep myself from writing another lengthy response to a, to me, seriously
reductive comparison of Zorn & Cage by Kevin McNeilly which appears in the
Jan. _Postmodern Culture_-- don't nobody tell Bruce how much time I'm
spending on here, I'm supposed to be working on the Andrews issue of Aerial,
it's our little secret, please) Gabrielle wrote:
>We speak in wonderful metaphors (I'm getting pictures of ideas like

I'm exactly arguing that ideas don't have "owners," but we come home to them
whether we want to or not. Art's part of what makes us aware of when they're
around. & some may be puppies, some grown-up, some old, some dead dogs--
mutts, chihuahuas, pit bulls, lassies, Snoopys & Goofys (Baudrillard?) &, of
course, east german shepherds. ggrrrrawwlrrrruff! ruff! ruff!

It's good to know that Meschonnic on rhythm is as interesting as
suggested by Marjorie Perloff. There's a writer who is really engaged
with rhythm-values. His translation of the Book of Jonah into French in the
"original rhythm" and his comments on it are well worth reading. It
would be of some interest to Jewish listers. ( nrf  Gallimard,
1981).

I do not hear how a "foot" implies a fixed metrical unit. Perhaps one
may imply such a thing when using the word, but how can the word do
so?

Surely, it is to historicize the usage of the word "foot" when one
goes to histoprical figures who support the idea of a free verse
foot; and in fact does it not historicize it when one first maintains
that there is such a thing, after years of regular walking.

For the majority of my life, and it has not been a short one, I have
understood the post-Hopkins foot to be what the oldtime
linguist-prosodists called a principal stress. I have no trouble
hearing the moments when ol' Doc Wms' feet come down on his attic
floor.

I agree completely unless (and it's a big unless) we are talking
strictly in historical terms of what the academy circa the early-mid
1950s meant by that phrase.

So here is where Marjorie's argument about you must historicize prosody
makes some real sense. It's the way I understood Josephine Miles
telling Melnick and I back in '69 or thereabouts that when she was
younger she and her peers "did not know how to hear Williams," could
not fathom what it was supposed to sound like on the page.

Me, I'm waiting for someone to reinvent Adelaide Crapsey's use of math
in all of this. No?

I was browsing through the Rare Disorders database of my Family Doctor CD
Rom and came across the following entry--POEMS Syndrome.  I know there are
many poets on this list.  I hope you are aware of your own pathology!!
<grin>

My apologies to those who are really suffering from this terrible problem,
but a definition's a definition.

789: POEMS Syndrome

POEMS Syndrome is an acronym for Polyneuropathy (a disease of many nerves),
Organomegaly (the enlargement of an organ), Endocrinopathy (a functional
disorder of an endocrine gland), M protein (monoclonal immunoglobin, a type
of antibody), and Skin changes.

Symptoms

Each letter of POEMS Syndrome stands for the following symptoms:

Polyneuropathy is a disease of many nerves that causes tingling, numbness,
burning pain, deficiencies in perception and vibratory sensations usually
in the limbs. Organomegaly may affect any organ such as enlargement of the
spleen (splenomegaly) or enlargement of the liver and the spleen
(hepatosplenomegaly). Disease of the endocrine system may affect any
endocrine gland (a gland that secretes hormones directly into the blood
stream). Deficient secretion of the thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism) may
occur. Sexual functioning may be affected in POEMS Syndrome due to
dysfunction of hormone secreting glands.

Adrenal secretion of hormones may also be insufficient. Elevated levels of
M protein are usually found in the blood. Skin manifestations may include
increased pigmentation (hyperpigmentation) and thickened skin resembling
Scleroderma (see Related Disorders section of this report).

Swelling of the lymph nodes (adenopathy) may also occur.

An abnormal accumulation of fluid (edema) in the abdominal cavity
(ascites), in connective tissue (anasarca), or in cells and tissues may
also occur. Most of the patients have a malignant bone marrow disease
called Multiple Myeloma. Abnormal proteins are usually present in the
plasma. (For more information on this disorder, choose "Multiple Myeloma"
as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)

Causes

The exact cause of POEMS Syndrome is not known. It has been suggested that
it may be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders are caused when the
body's natural defenses (antibodies, lymphocytes, etc.), against invading
organisms suddenly begin to attack perfectly healthy tissue for unknown
reasons.

The abnormal proteins from the multiple myeloma tumor is another possible
cause for this multi-system disease.

Affected Population

POEMS Syndrome is a rare disorder affecting males and females in equal numbers.

Therapies: Standard

Treatment of POEMS Syndrome involves immunosuppressive drugs such as
melphalan and prednisone.

Therapies: Investigational

Plasmapheresis may be of benefit in some cases of POEMS Syndrome. This
procedure is a method for removing unwanted substances (toxins, metabolic
substances and plasma parts such as antibodies and abnormal proteins) from
the blood. Blood is removed from the patient and blood cells are separated
from plasma. The patient's plasma is then replaced with other human plasma
and the blood is retransfused into the patient. This therapy is still under
investigation to analyze side effects and effectiveness. More research is
needed before plasmapheresis can be recommended for use in all but the most
severe cases of POEMS Syndrome.

As far as I know Winters never did repent of having invented a free

someone who rebuked Hart Crane for lack of repentance (a very well-

I would need to do an awful lot of scanning before reaching a conclusion like
the one above; I'm a bit puzzled by what should constitute *the data* for a
"historicization" concerning metrics if not the actual metrical structure of
the poems involved.  I.e. it seems to me you must scan first *then* relate the
results of the data to what you know about history.  If you decline to scan --
pronounce scanning as "not being fruitful" -- then what is the basis on which
judgments like the one above are made???

Normally I tend not to be evangelical on any subject, and I certainly don't
want to get into a food fight with anyone over "x is more fruitful than y",
but I find myself totally baffled by all this negativity over metrics.  I
consider it a tool -- in the presence of many other tools -- no more no less.
It can be *very interesting* to discover how the metrical structure of a poem
works.  The a-priori-template foot methodology *does* seem inappropriate for
a great deal of recent poetry; all the more reason to seek a new methodology.
Marjorie, when you say defining the measure "can never quite be done" I'm not
sure what you mean here.  If you mean that one can not be guaranteed of being
able to produce *predictive formulas* for where the measure boundaries will
fall, I agree with that completely.  But if you mean the *concept* of measure
can never be completely defined then I don't agree at all.  The concept of
measure, as I've explained it, stands or falls on the ability of listeners to
*hear* those boundaries of low bonding strength.  My belief is that once this
methodology is demonstrated, these boundaries are as easy for people to locate
as stress degrees.

I haven't read Meschonnic -- thanks for the reference -- so perhaps I ought to
defer judgment, but having a method for mapping metrical structure seems
useful to me.

George Bowering:
> For the majority of my life, and it has not been a short one, I have

Yes!  Where I would expand on this, George, is simply to map the *direction*
the unstressed syllables go in "attaching to" the stress -- i.e. to *which
stress* does a given unstressed syllable "belong".

Ron Silliman:

I'm quite emphatic that metrics has to take place with respect to *a
recitation* -- in fact it works best if you have a tape recording you can
play over and over and even slow down if need be.  If someone believes the
role of prosody is to allow the reader to extrapolate the sound based only
on the printed page then yes, the concepts I've been presenting will be very
unsatisfying.  (Of course the arrival of multimedia makes it easier than
ever to include the sound with the text.)

What a coincidence, Ron!~ I have, as you know, just come back from
Petersburg (I am going to try to write the trip off as research in

are poets and artists): Huey Lewis, Dewey Redman, and Louis Zukofsky.
It was published by the Ducklings Press, Leningrad.

I'm not speaking for Charles but I can give you my sense of it; at
least you will have one person's thoughts.

I don't think there's a rose hanging upside down over the mainframe
that houses the list. (Though that's not a bad image...) The intention
is not to have the list listed in all the lists of lists that get
published, thereby causing a lot of casual foot traffic. This also
includes not posting the existence of the list to other lists, where
people who might subscribe to lists just because they like to
subscribe to lists might subscribe to this list. It would be better I
would think for the number of subscribers not to get too large only
because at a certain point there can't be a sense of who's there if
it's among thousands.

> well, i've already told one student about getting on the list --he's
> done so and made some remarkable contributions.

Word of mouth has always been fine, I believe. (And students would
count, I would say, unless it was an assignment say, for each student
to subscribe and be required to make make twenty postings ...)

I'd use the same instincts you would if you were at a reading and some
photocopies were handed out. It's thoughtful to ask the posting person
before recirculating, I would think (and one is usually honored by
such a request!) though you wouldn't technically break any laws by not
doing so. I think such thoughtfulness more than any sense of rules
will do the most to maintain the level of trust necessary to such a
list.

All I meant was that the word "foot" is applicable only in cases of
syllable-stress prosody (i.e. meter), where we count feet.  In the case
of alliterative verse, the basis is the number of stresses per line,
never mind how many unstressed syllables in between.  In such a case (for
instance Hopkins, a good deal of Auden)what does a "foot" mean?  See, on
this point, the Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics--various relevant
articles.

My point about free verse is different.  Strictly speaking, free verse
means no counting, a variable line, and the line as unit rather than the
foot, or number of stresses or number of syllables per line, and so on.
But in practice, of course a poet like Williams kept the variability
limited: most of his earlier poems use between 3 and 5 stresses per line
and the syllable count is not all that variable either.  Now: if Williams
writes "free verse," what does John Ashbery write?  His long lines are
purposely prosaic with very little rhythmic repetition.  To speak of free
verse in this case and many others seems misleading and I think we need
to be more specific.  But of course, as Jim says, you always start with
actual analysis of stress, syllable count, pitch, juncture, etc.

   The search for a "new" term (or conceptualization) for the kind
   of verse someone "like Ashbery" writes is intriguing in that to
   dismiss him as merely "discursive" (or to valorize him for same
   reason) seems beyond the point...Yet, reading backwards from
   the contemporaries, many modernists (Stein, Stevens, Riding)
   seem to be equally removed from "song"--either in that they have
   a plainness in their diction or a hypnotic rhythm "akin to the
   saxophone"(as Eliot said of Stein)--Of course, "The Four Quartets"
   and some Moore (who despite her rhyme was tonally) also seem to
   be important "precursors" of a certain I-don't-want-to-say-discursive
   tone. But perhaps Moore would be disqualified because of the rhyme
   (as would Stevens because of the iambs?) as an alternative to
   "free verse"--Yet, when one reads Ashbery or Perelman or Harryman
   (scratch harryman for now--it makes it too complicated), one is
   definitely not reading most of O'Hara or Mayer or Armantrout?
   Would Marjorie, or anyone else say that the latter (O,M,A,)
   would fit under the rules of "free verse" as presumably so would
   Spicer and Weiners? And if this is this case, is this distinction
   argued on any grounds other than the "lyric" vs. "Discursive"
   debate? Chris Stroffolino

Jim (et al.),

I see Marjorie's point. Anyway, let me be pollyannish and say that we don't have
the tools to quantify modern and postmodern verse satisfactorily yet.

now let me be a wet blanket and say that, thanks to grad school and beyond
(the perils of an education where I saw/read enough poetry from various
times and places to see that there is no definition of poetry which can
be applied universally), poetry has been "demystified" for me; there is no
such thing as poetry (though I'll play the scan game anytime because it is
so much fun but inconclusive).  There is only the poetic.  And there is history,
a pleasure and maybe of some use to scholar and poet alike.

Scanning only makes sense when it is bracketed historically--which is not to say
(again) that scanning isn't worth one's while--that is, if one wishes to talk
about poetry.

Bernini's Architecture was under Baroque and Christopher Wren's

that time was simply not interested in discussing the arbitrariness

I think that I am getting something od what Marjorie is feeling when
she introduces the difference between Williams and Ashbery. (Or how
about the crossbred _Ko_ as in discursive endrime?). Certainly in
Ashbery I do not hear much in the way of feet walking (though I think
I still do in O'Hara's Lunch Poems). But I still dont hear feet as
necessarily regular. Maybe this is because I grew up in the
mountains, where you cannot march.

This discussion has been interesting.  I tend to agree with Burt that we
don't know enough yet to say conclusive things about current meter.  Even
more: to talk about a "current" conception of measure as being
particularly current tends to bracket others as "less current" and thus to
install a kind of a priori evaluative axis which I don't think is
particularly helpful.  There are lots of measures at work today; that fact
alone makes "periodization" in the sense that (I think -- correct me if
I'm wrong, Marjorie) Marjorie implies hopelessly reductive, since all such
measures are by definition current.

David

Marisa & Maria--on the "ghost" in the machine, Joan Retallack has a
fascinating essay, ":RE:THINKING:LITERARY:FEMINISM:(three essays onto
shaky grounds)," where she suggests that the ghost in the machine of
feminist writing is in fact masculine.  Experimental writing may be
feminist, she argues, but much experimental writing is done by men
(Russian futurists, British and American moderns, and so on).  "It may
seem like a betrayal of the few courageous women who are our clear
'feminist' ancestors . . . to acknowledge a 'feminine' tradition
dominated by males.  But it is far worse to deny the presence of the
feminine in language (as Ostriker and others do) by missing the fact that
the feminine has never been exclusively 'embodied' in female writers."
The essay can be found in FEMINIST MEASURES, edited by Lynn Keller and
Cristanne Miller (U of Michigan Press).  There are problems with the
argument--why still call this move "feminine"?--but it is a marvelous
antidote to Ostriker et al's essentialism.  And it gives access to
Retallack's own poetry (her new book IS good, Rod), which refuses to take
easy gender-based "sides."

I think the renga on the list idea a good one. I posted a sentence assuming
that we were following "the linked verse" of responding with a line that is
as far away as possible from the preceding. If I'm wrong about this scratch
my wonk bit.

I feel an obligation to point out that it's not clear that Haraki
Yasusada actually exists. I published a group discussion in _Aerial 6/7_
called "Renga & the New Sentence" by what purported to be three Japanese
poet/critics. I suspected at the time that it might be a fake, but chose to
publish it anyway, as it was simply too good to turn down. I've since had a
conversation that *seems* to confirm my suspicions (No, I can't say more than
that). Tho it's still unclear. I've talked to at least one person that's
pretty unhappy abt it. Implication being that an American posing as a
Japanese from Hiroshima should be questioned. They're probably right about
that. What caused me to question the "authenticity" of that text was that it
was a little too good & the speakers were a little too knowledgeable to be, I
thought, never seen or heard from by anybody on the scene. I mean this poetry
gang of ours-- it's NOT that big. Does anybody out there know Tosa Motokiyu,
&/or Ojiu Norinaga, &/or Okura Kyojin? I mean _besides_ Nils Ya.

Good, I had a feeling I was misunderstanding something.

Agreed.  Your aversion to the word foot in a "free verse" context is based
on counting, mine on the a priori character of the analysis, but we come out
the same place.

> My point about free verse is different.  Strictly speaking, free verse

Agreed again.

Whoa.  I *don't* agree here.  Surely everyone knows the syllables are there,
and we all talk a lot about line-breaks, and without question there has been
a lack of attention to an intermediate level *structural* metrical unit between
the line and the syllable.  In my opinion this is simply a gap in our
methodology rather than the inappropriateness of such a unit.

To return to Creeley for a moment:  The non-standard measure boundaries at
the end of the line are *very* prominent; everyone hears them.  The *standard*
measure boundaries in the middle of the two-measure lines are much more
subtle.  They (together with the fact that some lines are indeed one measure)
are what gives Creeley's rhythm its subtlety, its fluidity, its very life
it seems to me.  If you only look for syllables and stresses and line breaks
you miss this completely.

It is exactly to give meaningful identity to a metrical unit intermediate
between the syllable and the line that I've been talking about measure
boundaries, bonding strength, etc.  In my opinion, we haven't had much to say
about an intermediate level metrical unit not because there isn't anything
useful to say but because we *haven't been looking* for these units.  (And
why?  Because 'foot' has so much baggage!)  When you do go looking for them
they are right there, in plain earshot, and pretty interesting.

> Now: if Williams writes "free verse," what does John Ashbery write?

I've never tried to scan Ashbery, but would love to try.  Is there a tape of
a reading of _Flowchart_ available somewhere?  Until actually scanning Ashbery
I would not want to predict the outcome; frankly the Creeley results surprised
the hell out of me.

> you always start with
> actual analysis of stress, syllable count, pitch, juncture, etc.
                                                    ^^^^^^^^
Now I'm confused again:  perhaps we really *don't* disagree on an intermediate
level unit of metrics???

[Since the subject came up of proper etiquette for telling others about this
list ...]

<OPINION>

I am living in what I would call an overt state of corruption regarding
whether this list should be closed or open.  I say this because I believe it
should be open, and yet I value the relatively high signal to noise ratio,
which will, certainly, deteriorate if the list is completely open.  Actually,
to be a bit more accurate:  it is technically incorrect to say the list is
closed.  The list is fully open in the sense that anyone who knows the
correct E-mail address is auto-subscribed simply by sending a message.  It is
also technically incorrect that the list is "secret".  The fact that it is
openly archived on EPC -- along with enough address stamp information to give
anyone who can put two and two together the information for how to subscribe
-- means that it the list is, in an obscure way, being advertised.  [That
happens to be the way *I* found my way onto the list; *TWO* major members of
the list (who will remain nameless) "invited" me to subscribe but didn't tell
me how!]

There is something mildly offensive about archiving the list in a publicly
available place (EPC) and yet maintaining that the list is closed.  We seem
to be saying *OUR* words are worth archiving, dear net surfer, but *YOURS*
are not, we won't tell you how to get on this list.  This is pretty much
contrary to the general spirit of the net, it seems to me.

One point that I think should be made is that there is *no* "serious"
newsgroup (that I'm aware of, at any rate) on USENET for discussing poetry.
Where are the people who are not on this list who want to have a serious
discussion of the poetries we talk about here supposed to go??

A private list should be *PRIVATE*.  That means (1) subscription only by
permission of a moderator; (2) archiving only by ftp under a non-anonymous
account with a password; etc.

One possibility would be to keep this list the way it is but start a parallel
fully public list.  It would try to enforce signal to noise ratio by sheer
netiquette, the way most of the net does it.  (Signal to noise ratio is
*excellent* on most of the USENET technical groups; ht_lit, which has some
parallel concerns to this list, is fully open and has a fine signal to noise
ratio.)  Hopefully, the open list would suck the life out of the pseudo-
closed list; if instead the open list degenerates into a mess of mindless
posturing then there is still the "closed" list to fall back on.

It does trouble me that there is no open list/newsgroup for discussions of
the kind we have here.  To put it as bluntly as possible:  Are we snobs, or
what?

Both Avery Burns and Eric Selland swear that Yasusada is a fictive

trade who's spent years over there and knows the poetry scene
intimately, should be in a position to know.

Still, the work in Conjunctions is very good. I posted an enthusiastic

I don't see anything "mild" in its offensiveness, actually. Anyone who
has checked out the Usenet groups on poetry will see how closely they
map to a vision of literature proposed, say, by Writers Digest. And I
think there's a "fear" here that there would be "contamination" if this
list were suddenly to show up in all the Listserv directories. Also,
it's not strictly true that this is the only place to seriously discuss
poetry. A somewhat more moderated group, CAP-L, maps fairly closely to
the New Formalist set of concerns (or did until it got it's address
posted here and I, Bill Luoma, Chris Stroffalino (sorry about that
spelling) and others "polluted" it).

My own sense is more openness is good, but how to go about that. I, for
one, would have no compunction about listing this list on a very
compatible discussion group (and I would include CAP-L and Joseph
Zitt's Silence (Cage) discussion groups as two examples). Frankly,
anybody who discovers the EPC and is intrigued by the Poetics archives
ought to be told how to sign up (in fact, that should probably be a
part of the archives, no?).

About the list, open or closed, are we snobs?

I never thought the list was closed, never was told that. What I was told
was that the address should not be published on other lists, and
particularly not on any directories of lists. However, there was
encouragement to tell people about it and tell them how to subscribe if
they so desired. Growth was expected, with some sense as well that the list
would work best if there was at least a general sense of knowing the people
on the list (not necessarily knowing them before they participated, but
getting to know them on the list as well). My assumption was that
eventually the list, no matter what participants did, would grow to a size
that wasn't so cozy. But it seems people drop off the list and drop on.
Some drop back off. Some drop back on. So it seems there remains (I've been
here a year or more now) a sense of knowing who one is talking with.

Admittedly the ability to reach the archived list at EPC (which I first
found while browsing the web, although I did know about EPC before that)
complicates things for me. It's so easy to find on the web (at least if one
has Yahoo to point to art, then literature, then poetry) that it makes the
list seem very open indeed.

Still, I don't know that a change is needed in how it is managed. I don't
know if we're snobs or not. If we think of it as closed, then, yes, we're
snobs. I do agree with Jim Rosenberg that there is a need for a "fully
open" place to discuss poetry & poetics. However, if there were such a
place, would I find the discussion more or less enlivening than I find it
here? I don't know; I suppose I'd try it and find out. Here I've heard
about foot, soul, and jelly roll, buffalo wings, cassette royalties, and a
little more.

            1995 SIXTIES GENERATIONS CONFERENCE

             An Interdisciplinary Conference of
               Scholars, Activists and Artists

                     October 5-8, 1995

            Western Connecticut State University
                    Danbury, Connecticut


                Proposals due: August 15, 1995


I invite you to join us for the third annual Sixties Generations Conference:
From Montgomery to Viet Nam on October 5-8, 1995.  Last year over 400 scholars
and students joined us at Western Connecticut State University to hear  more
than one hundred presentations by academics, activists, and artists.  The
Sixties Generations Conference is a showcase for intelligent and lively academic
work in a variety of disciplines and studies fields, but what makes it special
is the interdisciplinary emphasis and the collegial atmosphere.  We've
demonstrated that mixing academics with artists, crossing disciplines, and
spanning generations fosters a creative and collaborative excitement that can't
be matched.  Our evaluation forms showed that over 95% of those who attended
last year will be back in 1995.  Here are some comments we received:

    "The Conference provided a rare opportunity to not only learn from
    scholars and artists but to engage in fruitful discussion that
    multiplied the impact of the meetings many times over. The organization
    and administration of the conference was superb and the facilities
    excellent. What was most gratifying was how so many of the scholars and
    artists in their lives and work sought to cut across traditional
    boundaries of gender, academic disciplines, and even of age: there was a

    lively mix of younger students and scholars and well-established
    teachers and professors. I look forward to next year's meeting knowing
    it will be a highlight  of my academic annual activities."

    "The conference was an outstanding mix of scholars, students, artists,
    participants, participant-observers, etc. One could sample informal
    networking and heavy-duty scholarship. The interactions of panels and
    audience was lively and informative.  Keep it up!"

    "I particularly appreciated the interdisciplinary  nature of the
    conference. If not unique, it is extremely rare. Vietnam veterans,
    scholars, antiwar activists, artists, musicians, and writers all
    dealing with the same subject--in a better society, Vietnam
    Generation would be recognized and nurtured as a national resource.

We remain committed to interdisciplinary work and to seeking diverse
presentations. We particularly encourage the participation of those
traditionally under-represented in academic discourse, and we do not shrink
from controversial topics.  In addition to soliciting work from traditional
disciplines, we enthusiastically invite presentations in African American
Studies, Chicano Studies, Women's Studies, Native American Studies and other
studies programs.

We know that most of the best work at conferences is done between sessions, when
people get the chance to talk, to share stories, to set up collaborations.  So
we do our best to make sure that there is plenty of time for these activities-we
arrange for meals to be available at the conference site, set up a lounge for
refreshments, and keep coffee and tea available all day long.  We also arrange
evening events--our Sixties style coffeehouse reading was so successful last
year that we will do it again, breaking it up into two nights of poetry,
fiction, multimedia and performance art.

As usual, we are doing all this work on a shoestring.  Viet Nam Generation,
Inc., is a literary and educational nonprofit which cannot yet afford to salary
its staff. This conference has been supported entirely by volunteer efforts,
the registration fees of participants and by our book sales.  The facilities are
generously provided by Western Connecticut State University. We know that many
conferences can afford to waive fees for those presenting papers, but we cannot.
We do waive fees for those who would not otherwise be able to participate, and
we do our best to find alternative housing for those who cannot afford hotel
rooms.  We're committed to the notion that no one should be turned away for lack
of funds.  To meet this goal we rely on support from those who do   have
funds-faculty members or others with full-time positions and decent incomes.  In
fact, we encourage you, if you can afford it, to pay an extra registration fee
to cover someone else with fewer resources.

We also encourage you to subscribe to our journal, Viet Nam Generation, a forum
for interdisciplinary written work on the war.  We publish many of the Sixties
Generations Conference  papers in the pages of the journal, which is now
entering its seventh volume year.  Your support enables us to continue our
efforts.

Part of our philosophy is that we do not rank those who attend the Sixties
Generations Conference-there are no "stars" here; we don't even put your
institution on your name tag.  We have no "keynote" speakers or "special"
sessions.  Those who attend don't do it for their c.v.  They do it-and we do
it-because the work we all do is vital, because we believe in an alternative to
the rest of the deadly dull gatherings which pass for conferences in academia,
and because we are dedicated to building a community of scholars, activists, and
artists who can support each other in our work.

I look forward to seeing you in October.

What a loss! Poetry has been demystified for you and you no longer
believe in it. There's no such thing as poetry?

I think this is where Theory goes back in time and kills its mother. What
are we all talking about if there is no poetry? Come on. Of course there is.

The more I "know" about poetry, the more mysterious it becomes. The more
I write, the harder it gets.

Just because there is no universal, static definition of poetry, that
doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Though perhaps it is a matter of faith. We
don't know what souls are either, but many of us believe we have them.
Who knows what animates one pile of words and not another? But can you
deny that some word combinations do "come to life," invoke something
beyond narrative, some mystery? To me, the very undefinability (is that a
word?) of a poem is what MAKES it a poem.

I can't believe grad school can kill a great poem, because nothing can
kill a great poem. Maybe the ability to fathom mystery is wounded by
certain kinds of education. If somebody convinces you that you know that
much, maybe you ought to wonder....

Subject:      Re: Yasusada = Ern Malley

This is Kevin Killian . . . I have my own two cents to add about the
Yasusada saga, but first I want to know if I understand correctly, is
"First Intensity" publishing yet more "new" work by Yasusada?  It seems
like a nightmare from several years back.

I remember trying to get in touch with Tosa Motokiyu who for some reason
had a P O Box in Sonoma County somewhere, and was sent a phone number-it
was like a spy novel by Ian Fleming.  Anyhow late at night, say, after
midnight, a woman called me up and told me that Tosa Motokiyu was not to be
bothered any more, that he was going through a painful divorce and no, no
matter what I thought, neither the Yasusada circle nor the
Motokiyu-Norinaga-Kyogin circle had any homosexual implications.  No unlike
the Georgekreis or the Spicer group there was no homosexual taint to either
Japanese group.

"I was just wondering," I said defensively.

"You have been misled, by your own imagination," she replied calmly.  "You
don't understand the Japanese way of life."

This was so true I couldn't think of what to add.  She explained that
Japanese poets giggle at Western homosexuality.

After we hung up I had this uneasy feeling and started wondering whether or
not Motokiyu had been honest with me.

Then I heard that the whole Yasusada corpus was very much a contemporary
product of a middle-aged white male poet, well known in the US, but not
well enough known for his own self-esteem as we say here in San Francisco.
This man had come up with the idea of inventing a whole Hiroshima poetry to
test the openness of U S magazines.  He was frustrated that his own poetry
was being rejected at every turn whereas people of color no matter how
untalented were being published.  "Yasusada" was to be his revenge on the
whole idea of the "politically correct," "multicultural" range of writing
being published & preferred today.

I was sent dozens and dozens of Yasusada's poems, and like Ron, was
impressed.  This was clearly a labor of love, if a little crazy and, by
implication, way homophobic and racist.  These events took place several
years ago as I say.  But I am still smarting from that dry little laugh on
the phone from Sonoma.  If Lee Chapman is on this list perhaps she could
clear up how and when she came in contact with the poetry she printed in
"First Intensity"?  Thanks you all!

A number of folks have asked, backchannel and front(?)channel, about the taped
readings that I mentioned: details on how to get them, etc. You should contact
Harriette Seiler, the Twentieth-Century Conference director; e-mail is
hmseil01@ulkyvm.louisville.edu. Harriette will have more specific information
than I do on the exact tapes that are available, price, etc. Let me know if
you have any problems getting hold of her.

Tom Kirby-Smith and "I can't walk": Yes, Phil Collins, but if we're (I'm)
going to be scholarly about it, Phil in his post-Peter Gabriel Genesis
incarnation, not in his Phil Collins incarnation.

On "soul," "spirit," etc. (I promise I won't say a word on it after this): for
fine (in all senses) meditations on these issues by a terrific contemporary
poet, see John Taggart's slim book on Hopper, Remaining in Light, and
his recent essay collection, Songs of Degrees (U of Alabama P). The questions
involved are more complicated than those of personal "belief," I take it; and
I take it partly because even as a devout atheist who can occasionally
approach agnosticism on a good day, I've found these books v. compelling
reading.

On the free verse prosody discussion: years ago I wrote an essay on Olson that
began as an attempt to come up with some kind of system or methodology for
analyzing/discussing non-metrical prosody. Part of my argument, however, was
that one needed to approach this analysis on a poet-by-poet, case-by-case
basis; that you could generalize about an individual poet's practice (or
practices, allowing for work by the same person in different modes, different
stages of their career, etc.) but that it was awfully hard to come up with a
method that applied across different poets' work (except for something that
operated at an unsatisfactory level of generality). And I tried to illustrate
all this via what now looks like a rather pedantic and technical close
prosodic analysis of "In Cold Hell, In Thicket." I have pretty mixed feelings
about this essay now, but my excuse/defense is that at the time of writing
(late '70s) hardly anything had been done on the subject as far as I knew,
though I think Don Wesling was getting going on his work around the same time.
Anyway, for anyone who's interested, the piece was in Language and Style 14
(1981).

Can't say as I see how calling it "art" clarifys. & it's true, I hope, that
the longer you write the more you learn, but I'm with B.K. in that the
"poetic" is not finally defineable. You know it when you see it, & who sees
it where is different, I think, for different people.

Thanks for the great feedback Gabrielle. I'm not stuck on the position I
presented (or maybe I am) but for the sake of the network of standard
stoppages I'll spin out a "defense."

Key to the differences we might have I think is this passage:
I wrote:
>. . .Which points to possibilities, that the ideas are already
> extant, within language, within contexts. . .

You responded:
 >This, to me, gets dangerous again--as though the ideas like >things exist
somehow within language but independent of it.  Back to the >private
>image and solipsism.

I don't see how what I wrote cld be construed as taking a position which
implied the formulation "within language but somehow independent of it." What
I wrote seems to me to be saying pretty much what the Hejinian quote I cited
is saying.  Which is precisely that ideas are not private (subjective), but
rather contextual (intersubjective), in ways we don't entirely understand--
thus the "in the air" formulation. A more accurate formulation is probably
not possible because no context is _ultimately_ defineable, because all
contexts are interrelated. This is a bit of Buddhist propaganda, but it seems
to me useful. (I'm not arguing that there's never enough information in a
given situation to act, merely that there are always more elements which
could be taken into account). To boil it down perhaps what I'm saying is that
every idea is an interaction. That the "heart of an idea" is not locatable
"except in its use"!

> It only gets tricky if one
>starts taking the metaphor seriously and concretizing it and
using it to
>explain the world.

It seems to me the viability of this articulation is only apparent precisely
when it is concretized. A good example of this is Cage's process in his later
writings such as _Themes & Variations_ , _I-VI_, & "Art Is Either A Complaint
Or Do Something Else." In this series he tried, & I think he often succeeded,
"to find a way of writing which though coming from ideas is not about them;
or is not about ideas but produces them." The manner in which he did this is
outlined in the introduction to _I-VI_ and in the interview w/ Joan Retallack
in _Aerial 6/7_, among other places. Briefly, it involved subjecting a source
text (or texts) to chance operations which then presented him with a mix of
source materials in which he then searched for ideas, eliminating materials
which allowed them to emerge. These were not necessarily semantic "ideas" but
could as well be "musical"-- i.e. related to the sound and texture, the
movement of language, as well as to the making of statements, obviously they
are always in some sense both of these.

Though one need not cite Cage to illustrate my point. Ashbery's "floating
pronouns" in a poem like "These Lacustrine Cities," or
Mallarme's famous "All Thought emits a Throw of the Dice" ("Tout Pensee emet
un Coup de Des") can't figure how to get diactical markings on this new
keyboard)), relate to what I'm saying.  More recently Carla Harryman's "Toy
Boats" in _Poetics Journal 5_ seems to me an excellent articulation of the
ways of thinking about these issues I'm forwarding. She writes: "I am an
indication of what occurs around me." & also, beautifully, "Both belief and
denial throw existence into question." She ends the piece with the following
paragraph: "A structure for writing that comes from anticipation relative to
an elsewhere, which to become a somewhere-- i.e., a writing --must borrow
from the things of this world in their partiality."

So, that's what I think right now. To respond to a few other points-- I
suspect that the idea of a schism in Wittgenstein's thought is based
partially in the events of his life, & I don't think that's an entirely bogus
point of view. In retrospect we can see the seeds of the late thought in the
early but there does seem an openness to a less proscriptive investigation in
the later work I think. It seems to me in the _Tractatus_ that he, like Pound
for so long, wanted to make it cohere.

Also you wrote:
> Look at how people make theories out of their
feelings, then concretize the theories and make the world fit >their
feelings.

It's become a bit of a cliche to say, but I'm not sure in the end we can
distinguish between emotion & intellect. That perhaps an oversimplification,
and if I were a scientist I might not say that. However, I was reading in
Alan Ryan's biography of Dewey
last night-- Dewey argued that "what scientists do when they try to
understand the world is not very different from what any of us do when we try
to decide what to do or think"-- this _feels_ right to me. (Dewey eschewed
both violent revolution & acceptance of the status quo in favor of the slogan
"Intelligent Action!" & although tagged "pragmatist" prefered the term
"experimentalism" -- i.e. find out what works and do that. Chomsky went to a
Deweyite school in Philadelphia til the age of 12.)

& finally (I didn't expect this to be such a long post, geeze, now I have to
keep myself from writing another lengthy response to a, to me, seriously
reductive comparison of Zorn & Cage by Kevin McNeilly which appears in the
Jan. _Postmodern Culture_-- don't nobody tell Bruce how much time I'm
spending on here, I'm supposed to be working on the Andrews issue of Aerial,
it's our little secret, please) Gabrielle wrote:
>We speak in wonderful metaphors (I'm getting pictures of ideas like
>puppies waiting for an owner to come home).

I'm exactly arguing that ideas don't have "owners," but we come home to them
whether we want to or not. Art's part of what makes us aware of when they're
around. & some may be puppies, some grown-up, some old, some dead dogs--
mutts, chihuahuas, pit bulls, lassies, Snoopys & Goofys (Baudrillard?) &, of
course, east german shepherds. ggrrrrawwlrrrruff! ruff! ruff!

Subject:      ON THE CONTRARY

I think that I was advised in THE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO THE INTERNET
never to say anything ironic by e-mail.

Once Douglas Bush, lecturing at Harvard, made reference to the
discovery of Wordsorth's illegitimate child  and remarked drily, that
"This discovery has done much to enhance his reputation in some
quarters." A Boston Newspaper reported this as an example of the
degeneracy of the academic profession. After that Bush advised,
with some shade of irony, "Never be ironic!"

With ingenuous candor I would like to say that Marjorie Perloff is
 absolutely right about this business of free verse feet/rhythms. (On
the subject of John Cage, though, I'd rather observe a few minutes of
complete silence.)

Jonathan,

Nothing "tricky" or facile about my relationship to the non-existent
poetry, but rather the opposite. Like marriage perhaps. Get past the
romantic stuff and really get down to the "real" thing, which ends up
being expressed in one or another finite ejaculation that stems out of
profound doubt or whatever. Don't mean to go Buddhist of Bronk on you,
but anyway, let me say that I believe in poetry, yet cannot ever say
comprehensively what it is, and this is good because this means that
I am now looking not at the poetry but at the human beings who make/have
made it. I.e., when I contemplate poetry I am using it as a tool for
learning about, for coming to know, the human experience.

Now I'm afraid I'm slipping back into the kind of pleasurable circular and
double talk that I participated in with some others on this list not long ago
about art etc., where to draw lines and so on.

Please don't take what I said, finally, as being either nihilistic or trite.
Rather, I am sharing with you my deepest concerns. And I welcome responses to
what I say because I am listening.

As Bronk once ended an early poem of his:

"I'd talk to you if I thought I could.
Tell me. What do you know?"

Willa,

Cf. my last post to Jonathan. I did not say I did not believe in poetry. And
yes, as you say, the mystery is the thing!  Let me correct you on one point:
theory has not spoiled poetry for me--it has deepened it for me. I am not
afraid of knowledge (though I deplore jargon as much as the next gal or guy).
My demystification came about from seeing so many "versions" of poetry that
didn't conform to each other, in various times and places, that I had to
conclude that poetry was culture specific. E.g, Beowulf's meter has what tto

do with with, say, Haiku (or even Renga!). Now, as for "the poetic"--here
I think we can begin to talk consistently about a human experience that
transcends particular culture,  period, etc.

Subject:      AA/student loan protest

I thought that some of you in California might be interested in Jamie's
intention to get a protest rolling about the Affirmative ACtion cut at
Berkeley and all the other cuts that are or will be devastating students,
welfare recipients and many others.  I'm sure she'd appreciate word from
anyone who'd like to get involved.

Gabrielle


From:  jaMarchant@aol.com

A month or two ago (whenever it was) when I first heard about Republicans'
prosed cuts in the student loan program, I could not believe it was real.  I
couldn't think they would seriously cut a program so needed and long standing
while proposing more tax cuts for the wealthy and while we still provide
cooperations with billions of dollars to help them finance overseas
advertising.  I was sure there would be protests and that "they" would do
something to stop this from happening.

Then last week when Wilson in a brash (I could use other adjectives, but I
will refrain) political move eliminated all AA in the UC system despite
protests from students, administration, and faculty, I deeply hoped that this
would backfire on him, and again that "they" would protest and do something
to make Wilson regret the day that he ever made such a rash move.

Then last night after composing my second post about our common enemy--the
richest 1% who control 40% of the wealth--(I hope I didn't wax too
melodramatic in my sleep deprived state), I began to wonder who this mystery
"they" that was going to stop Wilson and the Republicans on these two issues
was.  Regardless of how any of you feel about AA, the student loans cut if
they go through we end up costing all of us in a very direct way--$1000s or
$10,000s, and I know that most, if not all of us, are already broke and
deeply in debt.  If we, including myself, keep waiting around for "them" to
do something, we may be waiting for the rest of our lives and end up in
debtors' prision (since this now seems a very reasonable next move for the
Republicans).

It was then that I got my idea of organizing a protest march on Sacramento,
protesting these two issues.  I envisioned this protest occurring on the
second weekend after Fall semester begins on the UC campuses (could someone
attending a UC tell me when this would be?).  This would give undergraduates
time to return to campus and get involved.  In my mind, this grew into a
tremendous protest by getting, in addition to students, groups such as NOW,
the League of Women Voters, Jesse Jackson and his group, the Mexican American
Legal Defense league, Senators Boxer and Feinstein, etc., involved and acting
as co-sponsors of the protest.  I envisioned simulateous, although smaller,
protests occuring in other states.  In my sleep deprived state, this grew
into the largest student protest since the 60s.

So tell me have I come up with a brilliant idea, if slightly exaggerated
idea, or do I need to go back to bed and get some more sleep?  I can't do
this alone.  If you believe that it is a good idea and that it could work,
would you be willing to help, or do you have advice as to how we should go
about organizing such a thing?  If I go ahead on this, Erik or any other
Counsel representative, would the Graduate Student Caucus give its official
support, meaning allowing us to use its name to give us creditability when
contacting other groups?  I really think that there is enough angry out there
to mobilize people if someone would start the ball rolling.

I'm leaving town tomorrow to attend a Conference in Mississippi
and will be gone for about a week.  I look forward (I think) to hearing your
responses on this matter when I get back.  You can send your responses to my
personal email if you want since I'm not sure we should be taking up any more
space on the list.

Now that's an odd question to these ears.  Jazz musicians who wrote and
published poetry include Oliver Lake, Sun Ra, Cecil Taylor, Joseph
Jarman, and even , now and then, Dewey Redman.  Don't know if son Joshua
has had a try at verse yet.

But then, the question was prbably meant to be ironic, no?

maybe Dewey didn't actually write the poem I once heard him recite, though.

Hi Susan--

Just out of curiosity, what would you suggest as an alternative to
"feminine", assuming as I am that the term "feminine" has instead here been
dislocated from "femaleness" to suggest a set of attributes possessed by
both men and women?  Or is this a misreading?

Burt,

I was responding to your phrase "there is no such thing as poetry." But
I'm glad you DO believe in poetry afterall. I don't think that knowledge
can destroy anything, nevermind poetry. Theory is just another tool,
another language, and I don't even think "jargon" is so bad; it's just
words we invent to use among ourselves. I guess people are wary of jargon
because it might seem to exclude those outside the 'circle'. But all
circles of people, sub-cultures, whatever you want to call them, make up
their own words to use among themselves. My sister and her husband and
their two-year-old daughter have their own language.

You're saying that poetry is culture-specific, but the poetic transcends
cultural differences? That's an interesting thought. (Is this where your
disdain for jargon comes from? Jargon is hyper-culture-specific, and
therefore limits the poetic?) But it seems that FORMS of poetry, rather
than simply the whole entity of a POEM, is what is culture-specific. Yes,
Beowolf's meter has little in common with Haiku, but the emotional
content of two such different kinds of poems might be the same.

What do you think?

Subject:      beowulf (willa jargon)

   Willa raises a good point when she asks is it possible that the
   emotional content of Beowulf and "Haiku" might possibly be the same--
   I've been thinking about the "two poles" of the British poetic
   tradition--that the two pieces often AT THE BEGINNING of most
   anthologies are Caedmon's Hymn and Beowulf--and though the story
   behind Caedmon's hymn is more interesting than the hymn itself
   (bear with me if i sad this before--it's kinda a schtick), the
   difference between the "lyric" and the "epic" sensibility in these
   two pieces that we see still I suppose exists today---
   One could say that if Caedmon were a character in Beowulf he would
   actually be GRENDEL (if not Grendel's mother)--I think this notion
   of the "sensitive" lyric outsider running away from society vs. the
   "representative man" in Beowulf is quite emotionally distinct---
   Yet,they are both potentially MALE COMPENSATORY fantasies--and
   perhaps the "difference" between Dickinson and Whitman is a better
   paradigm if I'd like to stress the emotional difference between
   "epic" and "lyric"--for while Caedmon wanted to see "God as a roof"
   Dickinson wanted the top of her head blown off and thus provides
   a better Anti-Beowulf strategy (if that's what you're looking for)
   ---well, enough for now--I've probably already said too much....

Yeah, it looks up this renga things opens up a whole can of hypertextual

naturally in ever-branching hyper-dendritic form.

Also: Charles Alexander, i think, points out that i started w/ a
sentence and asks if that's usual.  Well, i really don't know, but i
guess you can do it however you like.  The Yasusada, or make that
"Yasusada," selections in FI are in sentence form, so i took them
as a model.  But i notice that in at least one of Ron Silliman's
contributions, he removed the period from my first sentence, thereby
starting a more stichic branching--which seems like a good idea too.

Somebody else--I think Rod Smith--asked about/proposed a rationale of
maximal disjunction between lines.  Again, at the risk of belaboring
the point, this seems like a good idea for a particular branching....

In any event, i hope people will keep posting, 'cause i'd like to

just went back to:

_Differences for Four Hands_ by Rosmarie Waldrop
_L'Archiviste_ by Laura Moriarty
_Fermina Marquez_ by Valery Larbaud

This was a thought provoked to speech by Juan Goytisolo's mildly vehement

yes indeed.  could anyone say more?  not so much about the first half, but the
second.  what is "the (transcultural) poetic"?  a heightened sense of verbal
"power," in whatever (aesthetic, medicinal, social etc) sense ? a frame of mind
(as in,"bob kaufman was a poet 24 hrs a day, 365 days a yr", without writing a
word for 10 yrs, etc)?--md

Willa,

last first: I don't think that haiku and four stress alliterative OE verse
carry the same emotional charges. why this is is a big exploration.

now as for jargon: yes you are right that jargon includes and/or excludes,
and is defined by that function. but jargon is also a personal reaching-for,
a poeticism if you will, and way to say something that has not been expressed,
I think, and thus it can begin as not part of a group. Perhaps groups
coalesce around jargon, when people with like goals are attracted to a
discourse. My problem with jargon has to do with the fact that I wish for
there to be unity in my experience. Often, jargon is fabricated and thus is
of the present, and so the past, history, tends to get excluded.  For
instance, I may know what you mean if you were to talk to me about, say,
"subject position," but I emotionally and maybe in some respects
cognitively--certainly psychologically, feel more comfortable with the term
"self," even as I may recognize that this term is so imprecise when discussing
for example the Western sense of "self" in the twelfth-century and in the
seventeenth-century and in the twentieth-century, that I cannot get very
far with it. On the other hand, "subject-position" provides me with a
revelation about individual consciousness vis-a-vis discourse within a group,
etc., that I can begin to think deeply about the differnt senses of self
at different times in history.  Yet, damnit,
"subject-position" is clumsy esthetically and in other ways and also severely
limited. But most of all, it has very little to do with my life as a whole.
I suppose the rest of my life will have to catch-up with my use of
"subject-position" and not the other way around.

Anyway, what this all boils down to is, that, frankly, I can't imagine, say,
two people making love and using the term "subject-position" in their conver-
sation (let's presume that some people talk while they make love_. I.e.,
it feels and therefore in some sense it is, unnatural. But I guess what we
feel is natural changes?

No this will not be about "re rereading", although the subject line
implies something thereabouts.

Good question, though.  Perhaps we should add why one is rereading
something. Yes?

Anyways, I've got salinger's Nine Short Stories back in hand, for
better or for worse.  This is because of a conversation with friends
about the significance of fruit and color in several of them.

SAdly, this is it.  I don't find the time for rereading, it seems. And
now that the question has been asked, I wonder why.

Steve--yes, this is the question, isn't it?  I think your reading is
entirely right; my problem, in the context of this article by Retallack,
is that "the feminine" is defined as/through "silence."  While there's
real intuitive truth to this, I'd like to see further distinctions.  What
is the difference, for example, between Laura Riding's silence and
Gertrude Stein's?  What is the force of that distinction?  As for Stein,
she put less fine a point on it in her geographical history of America:
"in this epoch the only real literary thinking has been done by a
woman."  Susan

SYMPOSIUM: (POST) COLONIAL FICTIONS: RE-READING ELIZA FRASER AND THE WRECK
OF THE STIRLING CASTLE.

University of Adelaide, 25-26 Nov., 1995.

Contact: Kay Schaffer, Department of Women's Studies, 08 303 5267 direct,
08 303 3345 FAX, e-mail: kschaffe@arts.adelaide.edu.au

Post-colonial studies within Australia have attempted to re-evaluate and
re- write colonial history to include those people either marginalised or
subjugated by the colonial process. This two day symposium will explore a
different aspect of post-colonial discourse through the exploration of one
of the best known events in Australian colonial history. In 1836 the
'Stirling Castle' was wrecked off the Queensland coast and many of the crew
together with the Captain's wife, Eliza, were marooned on Fraser Island.
Events surrounding the rescue of the castaways, in particular Mrs. Fraser,
received international media attention. In the last 160 years the story of
Eliza Fraser has become the subject of popular myth, fiction, opera, art,
film and scholarly research in the areas of cultural studies, literature,
history, anthropology, archaeology, women's studies, and the visual arts.
(Post) Colonial Fictions will examine critically the Eliza Fraser saga by
bringing together, for the first time, an interdisciplinary team of
academics, authors, artists and members of the Fraser Island community.
Discussions will include feminist analyses of the incident, textual and
iconographic representations of Aboriginal people, and Eliza Fraser as a
creative inspiration for the arts.

Speakers on 19th century ethnography, visual arts, and Fraser Island
history include: Ian Mc Niven, Lynette Russell, Rod McNeil, Olga Miller,
Elaine Brown; on 20th century cultural studies and Batdjala representations
include: Kay Schaffer, Sue Kossew, Jim Davidson, Jude Adams and Fiona
Foley. We are hopeful that the symposium will include an exhibition of
Fiona Foley's works and a performance by University of Adelaide
Conservatorium of Music students of the theatre opera: "Eliza Fraser Sings"
(arranged by Peter Sculthorpe/libretto by Barbara Blackman).



AUSTRALIAN STUDIES AND THE SHRINKING  PERIPHERY: SURFING THE NET FOR AUSTRALIA

The Centre for Australian Studies in Wales, University of Wales, Lampeter,
is hosting a conference next year entitled "Australian Studies and the
Shrinking Periphery: Surfing the Net for Australia."

"In recent years the consolidation of Europe into the 15 states of the EU,
the integration of east and west within Europe, and the progressive turning
of Australia to its own Pacific backyard have furthered the impression of
periphery: one world's edge looking distantly at the other."

And your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash,
Then your situation's hopeless, and your system's gonna crash!

You can't say this?
What a shame, sir!
We'll find you
Another game, sir.

If the label on the cable on the table at your house
Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse,
But your packets want to tunnel on another protocol
That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall,

And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss
So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,
Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,
'Cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!

          If we could only pull up our subject positions and coalesce
around a warm discourse, make-or fabricate if you must--a few clumsy
adjustments to those self-same subject positions then we just might find
ourselves lovers of jargon after all. Certainly I'd have to class myself as

another possibility wld be for people to post only one line w/out the text to
which they were responding, from which a variety of texts cld be made. i.e.
there wld be as many rengas as participants if it went on long enough.
this is why I originally posted a line w/out the preceding line-- I thought
we were going that way. Seems the easiest way to approximate hypertext in
this format. Though what's happening with the other permutations is good as
well.

It's difficult to tell when Eliot's being positive & when he's being negative.
I read somewhere that when he first wrote of Stravinsky's music that it was
like "horns and motors" he meant it positively (& I know that he was, or at
least became, a Stravinsky fan), but my reading of that phrase in _The
Waste Land_ is negative, due to the implied comparison with "times winghd
chariot".

        Just a thought,

                Tom.

Right, which is a statement with a masculine aggressiveness to it, which
moves it back toward the other end of the spectrum.  Hmm.  You're right, it
takes quite a bit of rigor to track a lot of these questions through the
slippery landscape of gender, and only a few have really successfully
negotiated it.  And language seems to engender itself, which complicates
things that much more.

Subject:      Re: beowulf (willa jargon)

  Dear Burt K.--Well, first I don't BELIEVE you when you say you can't
  imagine someone saying "subject position" while "making love"--
  but as for Caedmon's HYMN--there IS No original, with the music--
  I mean MAYBE Caedmon had a great voice and was a Bob Dylan or P.J.
  Harvey or something. What WE DO KNOW, however, is that the "text"
  (stripped of its music) has circulated beyond mere medievalist
  "circles" and has taken on an institutional life of its own as a
  version of "the thing itself" in vulgar official narratives of
  HISTORY OF ENGLISH LIT (just as "the ballad" is called a "hybrid
  form--neither music nor poetry" but this is only true from a
  certain perspective of what literature is, or has been, only with
  the advent of the printing press, etc.)---And, because the version
  we have (whether debased or not) has been accorded a privileged position
  as if AT THE BEGINNING of a tradition, it is worthwhile perhaps to
  consider the conception of "the lyric" that is implicitly justified
  by Caedmon (for instance, "christian"; for instance, "Confessional"--
  for instance "poet as rebel-turned-seer; or rudolph the rednosed
  reindeer). I am not arguing that these "myths" do not have a place
  in poetry, and even haunt the most radical poetry that inevitably,
  at one point or another, places itself in some kind of relation to
  this voice (be it Shakespeare or Stein or O'Hara or L Poets), only
  to recognize the way the text continues to be used in undergraduate
  survey courses (if nowhere else) which, to me, seems to matter more
  than some hypothetical reconstruction of the TRUE SPLENDOURS of the
  past that may very well be the present in drag. Thanks for taking
  this seriously, chris

i was trying to stay out of this one, cuz it seemed too volatile, and more
complex than i can muster my forces for at those odd itchy moments when i hit
the keyboard, but when i read "masculine aggressiveness," i feel compelled to
enter.  these denominations, "feminine" and "masculine," it seems, are simply
ways of noting --or creating --difference.  masculinity is associated w/
aggression, femininity with docility or gentleness, without much thoughtful
attention to the empirical world.  it's just a crude shorthand for perceived
opposition.  i can be as aggressive as the next guy which doesn't mean i'm
invoking a "masculine" side of myself.  i can be warm on occasion, even demur,
which doesn't mean that i'm being "feminine" in those instances.  can we find
some other way of referring to affect and behavior without calling on facile
gender categories to do our thinking for us?  and i'm not sure "language"
engenders itself --people do --i think language is smarter than people, and can
help us find a way out of this binary impasse.

I'm still unconvinced that ED's "top-of-the-head to you" means anything more
than a threshold of feeling a text has to pass to be considered "poetry" by
ED. (Tim Davis, also of Amherst, loves to report ED's epitaph: "Called
Back"). And I don't know if a Dickinson/Whitman dichotomy for epic/lyric (ha)
introduces any new rules--"magic is a joke you pay cash for"E. Denby.

As for the great divide my train created in response to M Boughn:
the divide between Olson's famous people "for whom everything
matters"--meaning meaning--and lucky us. That is. Pound watching the cantos
fragment around him and Olson thinking it's possible to hold all of
_something_ together (wrong). Then us. (And we go off with the words meaning
something ((at best, some pretty nothing--at worst, malicious or banal))
through us instead of our having them riemann-sum-up our
"meaning"--psychology-- or, we look at the interstitial writers as somehow
_holy_, to be quoted and _understood_--religio). In the face of it I'd rather
be, what, baroque? Clear? So it seems to me that Creeley's Olson (U Cal
Selected) is an attempt to take the Olson of meaning and present an Olson
through whom meaning happens... and yes Olson was on both sides of that issue
too. That is, Mike, I think something changed.

the summer 96 fashion shows are in full swing and
we should start talking about april, which
Farrar Straus Giroux and the Academy of American Poets
and I think the Poetry Society of America
are proclaiming national poetry book month.
Bookstores will be supplied with kiosks and displays
to I think J Galassi said in a closed meeting
move the slower titles on the backlists
of major publishers of poetry. Now. We need
to co-opt this if we can. We should assemble a list
of addresses of small bookstores and names
of buyers for the bigger chains, and if at all possible
we should prepare some kind of small press packet
to make the case that the real activity in poetry
is only _marginally_ going on at the big houses

If this doesn't seem to "let's-put-on-a-show"
I'll compile the bookstore address list
backchannel--send me the names and addresses

and those on the list with any "pull" might
investigate the possibility of getting a small press
liaison on the poetry month committee
so the backlists of Roof, United Artists, Leave
et cetera can get in the publicity packets

again this may be totally naive
however I'd like to go without cringing
past what bookstores remain next April
I didn't read this much for my children

a basic feature of the Rnga is supposed to be, as Jacques Roubaud neatly
summarized it, that the links (composed of 2 & 3 line sections) follow a
syallbic count, and that "any given link of the renga must form a poem
along with that which precedes it and this poem must be different from
that which it forms with the link which follows it."  The new rules
proposed in recent postings are in the tradition of proliferating
"binding" rules from the 14th century on.  What we have going, & perhaps
the medium made this inevitable, is something quite different, though no
less intriguing.  I wouldn't call it a "wronga" -- but maybe we should
give it a name of our own devising that might cause less confusion.  It's
clearly a ringer.

I second the wisdom of keeping out of this one, Maria, but I was reading
something yesterday that seemed to fit in here.  Quoting someone else is a
way of keeping out of this, don't you think?

It's Mary Russo in *The Female Grotesque* (Routledge, 1995) writing about
Michael Balint:

In his remarks on the circus act and funfairs, however, he includes female
figures in the aerial act or in the "primitive" sideshows as essential
"showpieces":

"One type of showpiece is either the beautiful, attractive women, or
frightening , odd, and strange females; the other type is powerful,
boasting, challenging men.  Simplified to bare essentials, practically all
stage plays or novels, however highbrow, are still concerned with these
three kinds of human ingredients."

His shifting syntax here suggests that both the "beautiful, attractive" and
the "odd and strange" female finally belongs to the same "type."  But are
there two types or are there three, since they separate out into "three
kinds of human ingredients?  Here, indeed, is the sex that is not one!  In
that part of the twin category of the female/woman that includes the
"frightening, odd, and strange *females*," one assumes the presence of
freaks and other grotesque curiosities who produce in the viewer a certain
state of ambivalent *dis*traction which is somehow involved or transformed
in the attraction of the other "*women*" (emphasis mine).  The proximity of
female grotesques to their attractive counterparts has a long history in
the typology of Western art and theater, especially comedy, in which the
whorish matron, the crone, the ugly stepsisters, and the nurse are brought
onstage for comparison and then dismissal.

Conceptually, the disjuncture between the relationship of the two (male and
female) and the three (male and two female) categories provides a space of
differentiation between women which is covered over in the dominant
fictions of gender and heterosexuality.  Teresa de Lauretis has written
eloquently of the "in-difference" of much contemporary critical discourse,
including feminist criticism, to those sexual differences which cannot be
contained within or placed definitively outside the heterosexually presumed
oppositional difference of male to female.  These "eccentric subjects"
occupy a position in what she designates, following film theory, as a
"space-off," the "space not visible in the frame but inferable from what
the frame makes visible."  De Lauretis sees this as an existing
"else-where" produced by and in representational practices and by what they
leave out or cannot represent; she also sees it as "a theoretical condition
of possibility" for feminism, defined as a heterogeneous and contradictory
process, rather than (as its critics and some of its friends would have it)
a finished product built along an untroubled axis of gender (perhaps this
"finished feminism" is somewhere so simple, but nowhere I have been).

                                        The Female Grotesque, pp. 39-40

This is a mere drop of complexity.  As I was saying, I'm keeping out of
this one--I'm just sitting here typing, a secretary/transchanneler like
Mina Harker.

Subject:      "Believe"?

This belief in poetry conversation has, well, rather elided the question
of "belief."  What does it mean to "believe" in poetry -- how similar is
it to other forms of belief?  I for one wish Burt hadn't backed away from
his original loaded statement.  If we take "belief" in Pierre Bourdieu's
sense of a "circle of belief" which constructs simultaneously the object
(poetry) and the value of the object, then none of us are likely to be
OUTSIDE that circle of belief insofar as we're having this conversation in
the first place.  On the other hand, it's worth questioning our own
role(s) in perpetuating a belief-circle which constructs our own position
in it, goes on happily with or without our participation, and has effects
we can't really control.  As in: I believe I'm in a nation-state, yet do
I believe IN it?

Cheers,
David

Chris,

Hey, I love to do some anthology bashing, from time to time, too. And indeed
I agree with you. As for music, of course there is a Music per se that must
accompany a poem like the Hymn. And there is also the "music" when the poem
is spoken, rather than sung or chanted.  I recently attended a performance of
Beowulf done with instruments that we think were of the sort that the
typical OE sceop used--constructed by some medieval instrument makers
and musicologists based on two rather co-synchronous instruments, one
found at Sutton Hoo and another in Germany (I forget where).  The combination
of chanting and singing and speaking, of picking and strumming etc. on the
harp, as well as the physical gestures of the performer who delivered
Beowulf, was revelatory. I walked out of that auditorium feeling that for
the first time I had come in contact with the Anglo-Saxon sensibility, and
that until that evening I did not really UNDERTSTAND what OE verse was
about. Performance was so important to it.  Anyway, if I have a point here,
it is that OE poetry and Old Japanese poetry, if experienced in full,
which would perhaps include music and dramatic reading, would be very different.
Best,

David,

As I am writing this, it is too early in the morning, having just gotten up
and thought to get some e-mail out of the way to clean out my buffer before
going camping, I feel that I don't believe in anything. But that's the story.
By tonight I will believe deeply, in something.

Anyway, please forgive my backing away again. But I did want to acknowledge
your serious response. And I want very much to talk about belief and hope to
do so after today.  I also want to learn more about the "circle of belief"
you mention.

let me only add here, at the risk of being really corny, that for a long
time i have thought that i would title my next book of poems "Belief."
And that it seems to me that our society feels more and more that belief
is something people are not capable of. And that Yeats' line, "the
best lack all conviction . . ." continues to reverberate for me.

When I write poetry I feel that I believe (this has nothing to do with
whether the poem is any good esthetically and/or intellectually).

Anyway, I would love to hear what others have to say about belief.

Is belief, much in the way some people see love as a product of hormone
secretions, just a matter of getting the body in gear?

just kidding (i think).

First invented by the whistle of a cardinal in the popular

Why these dots? in the race with dreams, dead birds
Flew into the words inverted, sabbath, race, in, whistle, window,
And retrograde, as many forms of sap coming unglued. Chalk salt

Hi Maria:

OK, you vote to scrap the terms altogether.  Our other options are:

1.  To keep them but divorce them from gender altogether (as yin and yang
originally referred not to gender but to the mossy  unmossy side of a tree).
This is what I was trying to get to, and I didn't quite make it in my post,
which is what riled you, I think.

2.  To keep them in a concept of gender but to expand beyond a binary
opposition of genders (I just read an article last month in the S.F. Bay
Guardian [I believe; maybe it was the Weekly] about certain geneticists who
believe that, biologically speaking, there are perhaps 5 human genders, and
Dodie's quoted material seems to me to dovetail with this notion in more
ontological terms.

3.  Forget the whole thing and go back to our caves.

I don't know which one is the best choice:  I would hope it's not 3, but I
have a sinking feeling it is.  All I can say again is:  this stuff is
tricky; we're all going to get confused, but I think it's important enough
to risk saying dumb things in good faith and to assume good faith and try to
help each other figure stuff out.

Steve

dear Burt Kimmelman,

you said you are interested in what others have to say about
belief.  so: for me, it does not detract from the reality of
love or belief to say that consciousness is physical.  when i
was a christian, i felt the presence of some amalgam of the
trinity as a core physical shock.  i have since thought i
understood what Emily was talking about, the top of the head
coming off, since that's what happened in the most fervent
prayer, speaking in tongues.  now, writing a poem and feeling
the thick of love are the two experiences that make me believe
in them, belief as experience rather than external reference.
so those are the two things i believe in: love and the power of
language.

7/29/85: I sent the following yesterday morning and again last night, but
it was bounced back to me. I also asked someone to forward it for me, so I
apologize it it makes it tot he list twice. Hopefully it will make it once.

Here's a personal note which perhaps has no place here, but I'm going to
inject it anyway. It's particularly for friends (Ron, Charles, Tom, Hank
Spencer, Kevin, Dodie, Maria, Joel, Bill, Juliana, Linda, Bob, Sandra, and
there are more, including lurkers I don't know about and probably some who
aren't on the list anymore).

As of July 31 I am no longer executive director of Minnesota Center for
Book Arts. The parting of the ways is something I understand and in some
ways brought on because of how central I believe artistic leadership is to
arts organizations, but it's also something I'm not entirely pleased about
as I float between "free at last" and "where am I?," knowing full well you
can't have one without the other.

I am pleased with many things accomplished there, including developing a
literary mission within/among the book arts there, making the place
considerably more open to women (yes, there is an "old boy printer's
network") and artists/programs of diverse natures in many ways, making it
embrace a wider sense of what the printed book might mean, and involving it
more with theoretical discussions of art and culture. Also several specific
things, like the Art & Language symposium, visits by Johanna Drucker, Brad
Freeman, Amos Paul Kennedy, Kathleen Fraser, Spencer Selby (Gary Sullivan &
Marta Deike brought him, but we were happy to host him), and upcoming ones
by Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge & Myung Mi Kim, among others, and this doesn't
include the 14 writers/artists/critics who were part of the Art & Language
symposium and who include participants on this list. Also publications like
the one on press right now which is a collaged language/visual meditation
with many sculptural dimensions, and an upcoming book of essays called
Talking the Boundless Book (Linda, your & Toshiki's contribution IS now
going to be part of that book, and a few others on this list, I believe,
already know that your work is part of the book as well -- I'll post
another announcement about this book in a few weeks).

But this is not to blow the center's or my horn, just to hope that such
activities continue and that people on this list find ways to keep up with
them if they do. It's been quite a two year ride and my main regret is not
having the budget or support to do quite a bit more in terms of widening
and sharpening the focus.

And to announce that Chax Press will become quite a bit
more active once again (more about that in a post in a few weeks), and that
at this time we have no plans to move, although it will be a subject of
discussion, and the southwestern light Cynthia and I spent so many good
years in up until two years ago still is something greatly missed.

We will be away at a cabin on a lake in northern Wisconsin for a week,
beginning Sunday, and I am going to set poetics, as of this morning, on
"nomail," so please send any personal messages to my direct e-mail
addressfor the next eight days, mcba@maroon.tc.umn.edu. That address will
remain main for quite a while, and I'll notify various people, and
re-subscribe to poetics, if it changes.

Thanks to all here for making this a part of my time at book arts the last
couple of years, and for putting up with my mixing up poetics & the book
arts now & then.

love,
charles

Sorry for this, but is Joel Kuszai listening or does anyone know where he
is? I gave my card with your address to my daughter to write you a letter,
and now I can't find it. And directory assistance doesn't have your phone
number, and my e-mail got bounced back to me. So if you're reading this
message, please write a note back. Or if anyone else has an address or
phone for Joel, please send it to me at my direct e-mail address (I so much
prefer the term "direct contact" or "one-to-one correspondence" to "back
channel," which sounds like something subversive or gossipy) as I will have
poetics set on "nomail" for the next six or so days during which I'll be

Here is the message I'd love you to read and forward to poetics.
I would be forever in your debt. It's just that I want others to hear what
my current situation is before they hear it either through the grapevine or
from my ex-employers. Thank you.

Message begins here:

Here's a personal note which perhaps has no place here, but I'm going to
inject it anyway. It's particularly for friends (Ron, Charles, Tom, Hank,
Spencer, Kevin, Dodie, Maria, Joel, Bill, Juliana, Linda, Bob, Sandra, and
there are more, including lurkers I don't know about and probably some who
aren't on the list anymore).

As of July 31 I am no longer executive director of Minnesota Center for
Book Arts. The parting of the ways is something I understand and in some
ways brought on because of how central I believe artistic leadership is to
arts organizations, but it's also something I'm not entirely pleased about
as I float between "free at last" and "where am I?," knowing full well you
can't have one without the other.

I am pleased with many things accomplished there, including developing a
literary mission within/among the book arts there, making the place

o golly gee shucks...back to my corner cave to breathe quietly.
but seriously folks, sometimes i think gender is overrated as a conversational
topic.  it doesn't make the top of my head fly off. all it does is remind me
that my paycheck is less than that of my male jr colleague who works on images
of queen elizabeth in spenser. (and he --as well as those who make these
monetary determinations --can talk a great line about anti-essentialism,
feminism, and the whole megilla, with utter sincerity)--md

yeah, i guess i kinda do, at least as a temporary experiment, to see what
happens.  it seems that invoking gender mixes anger and injustice into the
question of "difference," and it'd be interesting to find out if there're ways
of talking about difference that are neutral.  maybe there aren't.  how did yin
and yang evolve from mossy/nonmossy sides of trees to gender?  that's
fascinating, i never knew that, just goes to show...something--md

Rod,
Calling poetry "art" as Thomas did, was not an attempt to "clarify" any
more than calling the mechanics of poetry "tricks" was.  The point
of Thomas' statement was as you say: "the 'poetic' is not finally defineable
You know it when you seeit, & who sees it where is different."  My point
in quoting Thomas was to clarify that knowing the mechanics of how
poetry is made is not necessarily the road to disillusionment, as
was previously stated in reference to someone's grad school experiences.
I would think that knowing the tricks and then experiencing the results
would only increase one's awareness that something other than mechanics
is afoot.  I have no problem calling this undefined "art" and I have
wondered why there is a recurring reticence in discussions on the
poetics list to say poetry is an art and one that requires talent as
well as technique.

I haven't heard a history of meaning for the terms; I'd assume it just got
metaphorically mapped onto other binary pairs as the oracles proceeded to
interpret the observed world in terms of yin/yang.  Somewhere along the
road, gender became the dominant example of duality, so they became primary
translators of each other.

Subject:      Re: beowulf

I'm quoting two poets whose knowledge of Beowulf, in particular, and
anglo-saxon poetry beggars mine -

'References within the poem e.g. ll. 1063-70 suggest a sung performance.
Against that is the typical lack of syllabic regularity in the line: the
line seems designed to produce a varied spoken rhythm. Sentences too vary
in length and structure as though to give variety to spoken delivery. There
is no stanza-structure to guide melodic planning. In fact the only regular
unit is the line. Here, of the four stresses in each line, three are marked
by alliteration: in most cases they would, when spoken, be phonetically
obvious to the listener, certainly so if given a little emphasis. Equally,
a melodic formula could be designed for the four-stress line and repeated
for each line; or each line have a melodic shape fitting the contures of
the stress-pattern, rising in pitch at the 'stress' - this is the gist of
Thomas Cable's 'The Meter and Melody of Beowulf' (University of Illinois
Press, 1974). Melody must surely be based on the line structure, and not
slow delivery too much. J.C. Pope's 'The Rhythm of Beowulf' (Yale
University Press, 1966) suggests rhythmic performance in the sense of
modern mathematical-bar-rhythm: it is achieved with damage to the obvious
line-structure. The Anglo-Saxon harp, as found at Sutton Hoo, is not a
rhythmic or even chordal instrument: it covers a limited scale of notes and
would probably double the sung melodic line.' (Bill Griffiths)

'The glimpse we get of a trained poet spontaneously creating new work out
of flexible oral formulas, rooted in basic prosodic demands of alliteration
and stress, gives some hint about the generation of the poem. The scene in
which Hrothgar's bard retells a heroic episode from the Danish past
suggests a context for the actual performance of Beowulf. The allusive
method of the work, its oblique revelations and tantalising occlusions no
less than its stunningly discontinuous structure, argue that such
composition and performance assumed in the audience an extensive knowledge
of the traditions available to the poet. Thus the text can be understood as
an action in which the audience participates, a cultural fact which tends
to exclude the modern reader.' (John Porter)

and from Porter's 1975 as opposed to 1984 translation of the poem here's
it's section on the process of composition:

'                    At times king's thane
man word-laden,      songs recalling,
he who very many     ancient stories
well remembered,     words new devised
correctly linked;    man in turn began
the feat of Beowulf  skillfully to recite,
and artfully create  a tale in keeping,
words varying;       likewise told'

The issue of rhythm is crucial. Rhythm in folk musics has been tightened by
the twin processes of military organisation and industrialisation? The
storyteller Ben Gaggarty was here over the weekend and along with
traditional singer Chris Foster and poets Jean 'binta' Breeze and Merle
Collins we got into a protracted discussion of rhythm and oral traditions.
The question remains as to whether rhythm organically follows or imposes on
pulse? Rhythm in many 'folk' musics has become 'stricter' throughout the
twentieth century. Go way back into earlier millenia and the speculation
favours a looser feel. A beguiling subtlety of pulse.

Finally I'd recommend Eric Havelock's 'Preface To Plato' 9Basil Blackwell,
1963). I got into it about 20 years back through Eric Mottram's enthusiasm.
One terrific book. Just to whet the appetite by giving some chapter
headings:

'Poetry As Preserved Communication'
'Epic As Record versus Epic As Narrative'
'The Psychology of the Poetic Performance'
'The Content and Quality of the Poetised Statement'
'Separation of Knower from Known'

It discusses habits of 'variation within the same' for example. Here's
hoping some of this list's readers can get hold of copies or already know
this marvellous read.

cris,

my experience of the oral performance of beowulf, which i recently wrote
here about, suggests that the actual enunciation of what we now have as
a written text departed quite a bit from the regularity as we see it.
thank you so much for your comments, which I am saving for future reference.

Aldon Nielsen writes:

"a basic feature of the Rnga is supposed to be, as Jacques Roubaud neatly
summarized it, that the links (composed of 2 & 3 line sections) follow a
syallbic count, and that "any given link of the renga must form a poem
along with that which precedes it and this poem must be different from
that which it forms with the link which follows it."  The new rules
proposed in recent postings are in the tradition of proliferating
"binding" rules from the 14th century on.  What we have going, & perhaps
the medium made this inevitable, is something quite different, though no
less intriguing.  I wouldn't call it a "wronga" -- but maybe we should
give it a name of our own devising that might cause less confusion.  It's
clearly a ringer."

Well, according to the exalted authority of the Princeton Encyclopedia of
You-Know-What there *is* a tradition of very complex requirements for the
renga form. But it also came, "in Mid-Classical times," to be used as a
form of "relaxation after the rigors of composition in the tanka form."
This practice "tended to frivolity," but the more "serious" tradition
persisted as well, so that a distinction was made between serious (*ushin*)
and playful (*mushin*) forms.

Perhaps we cld consider our little exercise as belonging to the *mushin*
category.  So: *mush*!

Sen. Robert Dole
Rochester Community Center, Rochester, NH.   July 30, 1995

Well first of all I thank you for coming out on a Sunday afternoon
I appreciate it very much. I'm sorry Elizabeth cannot be here but
she's just recovering from a carotid artery operation which they
had to do twice uh in the last six months. But in any event she's
back at work and she'll be out on the campaign trail soon.  They
gave me the day off yesterday, it was her birthday so they gave me
the day yesterday so I got to stay in Washington, but uh I've been
coming to New Hampshire for a long time.  In  fact I've probably
been in Rochester before anybody here was ever in Rochester.  Let's
see, maybe forty five years ago I used to come to Rochester from
time to time from the larger city of Farmington.
[laughter and applause]
And uh I so I know about Rochester.  The Mayor's here also and his
wife Pat.  We're happy to have the Mayor here.  Where is the Mayor?
He's here somewhere.  Thank you very much for coming, we appreciate
it very much.
[applause]
You know I've been in politics for some time.  And some people say
that's the trouble you've been in politics too long.  But then I
think that if I'm going to have an operation I want somebody who's
been in there for a while who's working me over. Or if I'm going to
buy anything I want somebody to represent to me, well I know you
have to get started sometime, but I don't think experience is bad.
That's the point I want to make.
And I've had a lot of experience.  And I've made a lot of
decisions.  And I'm not perfect.  But I'd like to think that most
of the votes I've cast over the years have been mainstream
conservative votes that most Americans would support.  We we can't
agree on every issue, there's some issues we disagree on.  There's
some single issue that people disagree on.  Some disagree so much
they leave the party or they won't vote for anybody who has a
different point of view. In my view that's not the way to build the
Republican party.

There's so much we agree on particularly on economic issues  It's
my view that the hope of American lies with strengthening the
Republican party and making it stronger.  Of course it's pretty
strong right here in New Hampshire.  I was asking George [Lovejoy]
how many, they have 24 senators and 18 Republicans.  18 to 6 now
that's that's a big margin.  In the U.S. Senate we have 54
Republicans and 46 Democrats.  And all the Republicans don't stick
together all the time.  So you've always got little slippage there.


But the thing that really happened that caught the attention of the
American people was in 1994.  Last November we had a political
earthquake in America.  And whether you're Democrats or Republicans
or Independents you got to believe that there was a seismic change
in what happened.  The American people by and large, Democrats,
Republicans, whatever, said, "We've had enough."  We want to return
power back to the states and back to the people.  We want to make
the government smaller. We know the government does a lot of good
things.  Probably everybody in this room may have benefitted or
will benefit the federal program while you're on this earth.  So
I'm not suggesting the government hasn't done a lot of good things,
but I watched it grow, and I voted against its growth.  I voted
against the Education Department.  I voted against HUD.  I voted
against the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  I voted against
the National Endowment for the Arts.

And I've tried over the years to try keep the government smaller
because somebody has to pay for it.  And you know who that is.
It's you.  The people in the first row and the people in the last
row and all the people in between.  So that's what this election's
all about.  We have a number of good Republican candidates running
for President.  They're all friends of mine.  I've worked with
them.  I've served with the four Republican Senators running for
President.  So I've served with them everyday, everyday they're in
town and everyday I'm in town, which is about everyday.

So I just suggest that you're going to make the choice, and a lot
of people in the other states will never have the opportunity to
make because New Hampshire is so important and New Hampshire will
have the first primary. I don't care what happens. New Hampshire
will be the first primary state. And it should be the first primary
state. And it's gonna happen.
[applause]
Iowa will have the first caucus state.  Iowa had the first, in fact
the Governor of Iowa is somewhere campaigning for me today in New
Hampshire. He's one of my supporters.

Let me also say that I understand the importance of Portsmouth's
Naval Yard to this group.  Many may work there.  Many certainly
indirectly or directly have an interest in Portsmouth.  We're
pleased that it's over.  And I would just say as an [aside,?] that
it's not based on politics.  I didn't make any calls.  But when
they had this eight member Brack commission vote to put Portsmouth
back on the list.  The vote was six to two.  The two people I
appointed voted not to even to put you back on the list.  So I
think my people who looked very objective in my view they didn't
think Portsmouth should even be looked at again.  They thought it
was a clear case.  Made a convincing case.  Certainly the Senator
and Congressman Zeliff and others in this room played a major part
in that.  But I would just say that I have I have been there many
times, know where it is and I understand its importance.

Let me also talk about leadership.  I don't know how many people
here really, really are concerned with what happens in some far off
place like Bosnia.  We watch television.  We're all compassionate
people.  We don't like to see children murdered.  We don't like to
see women ravaged.  We don't like to see older people driven down
the streets, driven from their homes.  But we also know that we
can't reach out as Americans and take care of everybody in the
world.  We know that.  As much as we feel we're a compassionate
people.  We're willing to help but there's some things we just
cannot do.

But one thing we could do in Bosnia is the thing I've been talking
about even in the Bush administration.  I must confess I was
somewhat critical of the Bush administration.  All the Bosnian
people have ever asked us is to lift this illegal embargo and let
them defend themselves.  Not send American troops.  President
Clinton promises to send 25,000 American troops.  I doubt he could
get that authority from Congress.  So what we did last week in the
senate by a vote of 69 to 29 . By law would direct the President to
lift the arms embargo.  What does that mean?  It means the Bosnians
are gonna to have the same chance as the others involved in that
conflict to defend themselves.  They're an independent nation.
They're a member of United Nations.  They have a right to self
defense under Article 51 of the United Nations charter.  And they
ought to have that right.  And the House is going to take it up on
Tuesday.  We think its going to be an overwhelming vote.  And I
assume the President may veto it.  Then we have to override the
veto which takes two thirds vote.  And we think its time the
President tried [his leadership?]
[Applause]
Now the importance not only in Bosnia is the lack of prestige and
the loss of prestige that we've suffered in the last 30 months
under President Clinton.  He made it very clear when he was running
that foreign policy was never gonna be high on his priority list.
And I would guess as we've talked to each other we don't talk to
much about foreign policy.  But sometimes it's very important.
Sometimes it could involve your son or your grandson or somebody
you know somewhere else some relative or some friend or some
neighbor.  And we've got to be prepared.  We've got to be prepared.
We've got to provide the leadership.  But it's always occurred to
me that when Americans providing strong leadership whether its
moral or spiritual or economic or military, generally good things
happen.  We've had no leadership.  And don't take it from me.  Read
the different columns.  Read Bill Safire in the New York Times, or
read anybody else who focuses on foreign policy from time to time
about this administration's lack of leadership.  It's all about
leadership.  It's all about standing up to the American people and
saying this is what we are going to do.  And then doing it.  And
not changing it because some poll says oh you shouldn't do that you
ought to do this.  And that's what leadership's about.  So let me
just conclude and then I'll be happy to take questions.

I also believe that one of the biggest issues in America is welfare
reform.  Welfare reform is very important not just to the taxpayers
in this audience but also important to the people that must receive
the benefits.  And we've had 40 years of failure.  There's no doubt
about it I don't care who they are.  You have admit we've had
failure.  We spent billions and billions and billions of dollars
and there're more people in trouble, more people below the poverty
[inaudible], more children born out of wedlock, more crime, more
drugs.  And it hasn't worked.  It hasn't worked. So getting to what
we would like to do and I'll speak about this tomorrow in
Burlington at the Governors' Conference. I speak in the morning and
President Clinton in the afternoon.  He doesn't have welfare plan,
but he'll go up and tell them he has a plan.  If he has a plan we'd
like to see it.  He doesn't have a plan for the budget, but he
talks about a budget.  He doesn't have a plan for Medicare, but he
talks about how Republicans are going to do in senior citizens,
which is not the truth at all.   We're going to preserve and
protect medicare and I hope somebody asks me that question.

But welfare reform is very important.  By giving block grants,
money to the Governors, to Governor Merrill, let Governor Merrill
make the decisions.  Let him make the decisions.  Let the state
senate and the state assembly make the decisions.  If we can do it
for about twenty percent less and save billions and billions of
dollars and have a better welfare system, which is gonna be much
more responsive to needs the people that have to have it.  And
we're going to have work requirements.  If you can work you work.
Real work, not job training, not going to school, but real work.
That's what the program's all about.
[Applause]
Now Republicans had trouble getting together on the Senate side.
We're just about there.  We hope to have a bill to introduce on
Tuesday.  And we hope to take it up.  We're gonna we're not gonna
have a, the House'll be in recess and the Senate will still be
working.  Cause we work more slowly.  Our founding fathers wanted
it that way.  And we haven't let them down.  You know it flows
pretty slow.

In fact on the balanced budget amendment, I remember we took
twenty-two days and lost by one vote.  That was disheartening.  We
had a lot of debate.  And I'm reminded, if you watch C-SPAN, you've
probably watched Robert Byrd from time to time, the Senator from
West Virginia, a Democrat.  He didn't like the balanced budget
amendment.  Said, "It was a terrible thing, we shouldn't have it."
He's also a student of Roman history.  If you've ever happened to
listen to one of his Roman history lectures.  I tried to get C-SPAN
to offer college credit for people who would listen to his Roman
history lessons.  But, I remember one day on the Senate floor he
was waxing away and he's very, and I say it with some admiration
cause he knows alot about Senate rules and alot about Roman
history.  And he was talking about the balanced budget amendment,
and he said "It was so bad that if Cicero were alive today he would
be against the balanced budget amendment."  At which time Senator
Thurmond arose and said, "Well, I knew Cicero and he was for the
balanced budget amendment."  Now Senator Thurmond's only ninety-
two.  I was with him in South Carolina, Friday.  He's my honorary
Chairman there.  He's going to run again in ninety-six.  He said
"If he's re-elected he may consider term limits."
[laughter]
He only wants to serve a couple more terms.  That's be twelve
years.  Then he wants to do something worthwhile.  So if anybody
here feels old just walk around with Strom for a couple of days and
you'll feel like a spring chicken.

Well let me say finally.  I'll talk about the three R's and then
I'll stop.  Rein in the federal government.  It's gotten too big.
Reconnect the government with the [vantages?] of the people here
today and all across America.  A lot of the things we think the
government does good, ends up doing bad.  Then reassert ourselves
as a nation wherever and whenever challenged.  I'm not just talking
about the military.  The President of the United States should use
that office as a bully pulpit.

Lots of people in Hollywood know or the entertainment industry,
that there's something more to this business than how much money
you can make.  That there are children involved.  As I see the
young man here in the third row and other young people here.  And
all we're asking is, we're not asking for censorship, I'd be
opposed to censorship.  But we're asking if you ever tried to read
the some of the lyrics. and I know probably nobody here wouldn't
even dare read the lyrics or attend some of the movies.  I believe
the President of the United States, if he has credibility and
integrity, he can provide a lot of leadership and we could have
movies that we could watch together with our children or
grandchildren.
[Applause]
Before I take the first question, everybody has a little card like
this.  It's a little card we hope you'll fill out, because that
means you're gonna help us.  And, at least we hope it means you're
gonna help us.  If you wanna have a coffee or a barbecue or
Congressman Zeliff and I'll probably be back, before the election
of course.  And we'll be back after the election too.  I know how
to get back to New Hampshire after the election as well as before
the election.  So, it's just that we hope you can help us.  We have
a great organization here.  It's gonna be run by New Hampshire
people not outsiders.  It's gonna be run by New Hampshire
Congressman Zeliff's my state chairman, Judd Gregg is my regional
chairman, Congressman Bass is gonna to be on board before long. And
we hope many we hope to announce many many others here in the near
future before.  So having said that, I'd be happy to respond to
questions.
