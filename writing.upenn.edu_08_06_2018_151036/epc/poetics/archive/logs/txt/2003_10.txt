Does anyone know of a good book (for beginners) about Haiku? I could use a
recommendation or two to pass along to a student.


Thanks thanks

wander


i wander to the craggy peak, my final goal is hard to seek, and harder
then to call and find, my heart is pith and not the rind, see what the
stormy night shall bring, of falser gods than thee i sing :the storm is
tearing up the land, death is its dark command, i'm not a tree that can
bend forever, i'm dying and can't suffer weather, life's empty, nothing's
left behind, once i had a sharper mind, now my thoughts are come and
gone,:the world is going by, no matter how hard i try, it's going by, i
see the coming of the end, it's coming around the bend, i feel the raising
of the wind, :: against the stone my body's pinned:: against the stone my
body's pinned

We'll meet again,
Don't know where,
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again
some sunny day

Keep smiling through,
Just like you always do
Till the blue skies drive
the dark clouds far away

So will you please say "Hello"
To the folks that I know
Tell them I won't be long
They'll be happy to know
That as you saw me go
I was singing this song

We'll meet again,
Don't know where,
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again
some sunny day

During the 1990s memory and history, as well as official and unofficial
ways to recover memory or commemorate events became a very hot subject
among historians, leading to a series of conferences on memory and history
in the UK and the US.  Here are two collections of articles that came out
of that ferment:

  Historical Perspectives on Memory, ed. Anne Ollilia
  Commemorations: The Politics of National Identity, ed. John R. Gillis

There's also a little book called The Haiku Handbook by William J. Higginson
with Penny Harter. History of the form (and other Japanese forms, plus
plenty of examples of Basho et. al.) Published by Kodansha International.

Mine's a million years ol--ok, 1985--but I think it's still available:

To everyone out there from New England:

ART NEW ENGLAND magazine is accepting submissions for publication. We are
seeking interesting and engaging work that is challenging but not impenetrable.
Previous poets published have included Sean Cole, Anna Moschovakis, and Joseph
Torra. We prefer to focus our attentions on poets from New England
(occasionally New York), and in particular are interested in poets from outside
of Massachusetts.

To submit via email send 5 or 6 poems to me, Aaron Tieger (poetry editor) at
atieger@yahoo.com. Poems may be included in the body of an email unless layout
is a consideration, in which case Microsoft Word attachments are preferred.

To submit via regular mail send 5 or 6 poems to

Art New England
425 Washington Street,
Brighton, MA 02135
Attn: Aaron Tieger, Poetry Editor

Include SASE if you want your poems back, etc.

Thanks!

The surrealist poet Philippe Soupault wrote four volumes of memoirs at the end
of his life which sort of match the description technically, but have nothing
to do with the subject at hand in all reality, but I love the books -- they all
have the collective title

Memoires de l'Oubli.  I think the one that covers the years 1917-1923 is the
most interesting.  I haven't read the one from 1927-1933.  He was in the US for
much of that time, and saw the depression, and met WCW many times, and he knew
Roosevelt and met Hitler in an elevator in Berlin.

The Essential Haiku--Versions of Basho, Buson and Issa, ed. by Robert Haas
i would esp recommend for the piece by Basho, "Learn from the Pine" and the
writing down of his sayings by a pupil--also the prose journal by Issa--the
way that haiku and prose can be interwoven--and the juxaposition of these
great haiku masters, the differences in their style, subject matter--one can
learn so very much from these--how many avenues and enquiries haiku open--

Remembering Edward Said

Hilton Obenzinger

Edward Said was my Sophomore English teacher at Columbia at the time of the
1967 War.  I hadn't even realized that the professor standing before the
class in Hamilton Hall was an Arab much less a Palestinian  and it would be
a year or two before I even knew that there could be such a person as a
"Palestinian."  I remember his wry tone and how his four o'clock shadow
would shine through his cheeks in ways that would remind me of my older
brother who had died a few years before.  If anything, I would have thought
our professor was Jewish, and a version of my older brother.  I don't
remember anything that we studied; only that he radiated a sense of
profound culture and compassion, that literature truly mattered, and that a
vast intelligence flowed from reading great works.

I believe classes were over when the war broke out.  I stayed up all night,
distraught, and in the very early morning I sat on the Sundial in the
middle of the campus and read the newspaper.  One story reported
anti-Jewish riots in Morocco and of Jews getting their throats slit, and I
wept in the dawn quiet at the horrors of war and hatred.  I had no idea of
the tears that my professor may have shed.

When Orientalism appeared, and particularly when Said began to speak out
about the plight of the Palestinians, I realized that our paths had crossed
at an historic juncture, as minor as that encounter may have been in his
eyes.  He spoke out as a Palestinian sympathetic to the history of Jewish
suffering and I as a Jew critical of Israel and Zionism, and the irony was
driven home of having been in his class in June, 1967.  As the years
passed, I would have many occasions to meet him at political events in
support of Middle East peace and at academic conferences and to say hello
and remind each other of that moment.

I had the honor of writing a review of his book "The Question of Palestine"
for the Journal of Palestine Studies.  It was a favorable review, of
course, but I did raise some questions about his characterization of the
left parties in the PLO and their advocacy of a democratic, secular state,
and I was nervous that the questions in my review would have offended
him.  At the time, he favored the two-state solution, and I was more
partial to the idea of a single, democratic secular state.  But when we met
at an event some time later, he was warm and friendly, and I was relieved.

Said's intellectual work became increasingly important to me.  His approach
to literature and culture brought in harsh social realities that had
previously been rendered invisible, brought in politics and history while
at the same time exulting in the qualities of literature, despite (or even
because of) the influence of imperial agendas and other material
impositions.  To realize how the Orientalist outlook affects George Elliot
or Herman Melville or T. S. Eliot only broadens the response to the text;
it does not narrow it or denigrate it, as some suggest.  Reading
"Orientalism," I was reminded of the sense I had felt in that classroom in
1967, the deep experience of literature and culture.  Edward Said had
remained my professor.

The last time I saw him was at an MLA convention in the late nineties.  We
talked for a while about the dismal situation in the Middle East.  He was a
vocal critic of the Oslo Accords and had begun to shift his position to see
that the only solution would be a single bi-national state, no matter how
implausible that may seem now, because Israel was doing everything it could
to undermine a viable, independent Palestinian state. I felt I could not
criticize the Palestinians for attempting anything in such dire conditions,
despite the obvious flaws of Oslo, and I had shifted to resigning myself to
a two-state solution, ready to accept whatever compromise to stop the
continued suffering.  I knew he was ill, and he spoke of how he had to
struggle for the energy to continue despite his illness.  When we parted, I
feared that would be the last time we would meet, and it was.

I cannot call myself one of his close friends, and we were never
colleagues.  I can only count myself as one of his former students, an
unexceptional undergraduate in a required course, but his presence and his
work have deeply affected me throughout my life.  I teach at Stanford now,
and there is no Sundial.  But when I heard the news of Edward Said's death,
I walked to the Quad, the center of this particular campus, and I wept for
my teacher.

A reminder for those of you in NYC

Gail Scott is in town right now as part of her American tour to launch
the Dalkey Archive edition of her experimental novel My Paris. This is
one of her most daring books, filled with sexy language and astute
observations about post-colonial Paris, identity, passing,
republicanism, and history. She's giving two readings here, one in
Brooklyn Thursday night and one at the CUNY Graduate Center English
Department on Friday afternoon. On Friday she'll be discussing/answering
questions after her reading, and there will also be a talk about Walter
Benjamin (who is central to My Paris). AND there will be food and drink.
For free.

Oct. 2: Soft Skull Reading Series, Shortwave Bookstore, Brooklyn, 7pm.
Corner of State and Bond in Boerum Hill (downtown Brooklyn).

Oct. 3: CUNY Graduate Center, English Dept., 3pm
365 Fifth Ave. (at 34th Street), Room 4406. Take almost any subway to
34th Street.


Gail Scott is one of Canada’s foremost avant-garde fiction-writers. Her
books include Heroine, Main Brides, and Spare Parts Plus Two.
My Paris, which was named one of the ten best novels of 1999 by Canada’s
Quill & Quire, is a faux journal of turn-of-the-millennium Paris,
invoking Gertrude Stein and Walter Benjamin, among others, in an
intimate walking tour of desire, resistance, fantasy and subversion.

“My Paris is a pointillistic tour de force.” —Charles Bernstein.
“Her Paris is pretty stunning art.” —Eileen Myles

I was so glad to read your sincere tribute, particularly because I read
it moments after reading this piece (link below) in the Daily News,
which is the worst kind of self-serving, cynical, ideological rhetoric,
and left me sputtering. Yours moved me.

R.H. Blyth, Haiku (4 vols). Try the library unless you want to drop a
bundle. Blyth gives the japanese, transliteration, and translation,
embedded in deep commentary on the meanings within Japanese culture. The
first volume, Eastern Culture, is by itself invaluable, and available used
through abebooks (http://dogbert.abebooks.com/) for $12.00 (for some reason
vols 3 and 4 are very expensive). It includes a section on technique. Its
first two sections, Spiritual Origins and Zen, are masterful. There are
also brief chapters on Basho, Buson, Issa and Shiki, but the haiku included
in the text throughout are by no means limited to them.

Reading Blyth was one of the great poetry, and also spiritual, experiences
of my life.

Blyth compsed the book while interned in Japan as an enemy alien during WWII.

Prose poetry from Rosmarie Waldrop: "First research. Parents, trees ravaged
with hunger. (Erotic?) If I feel anonymous, is the infinite unsexed?"

Thomas Lux provides a "Guide To The Perpetually Perplexed":  "Too much /
perplexity and soon everyone's head / is a revolving hologram of a question mark!
/ Instead: if the sign says USE YOUR WORDS, / then use your words, / in this
order: subject, verb, object."

Matthea Harvey writes of the self: "Heads in the planets, toes tucked / under
carpets, that's how we got our bodies // through."

Michael C. Blumenthal ironically observes the morality of our civic leaders:
"Yet everywhere, even here, / life has its way: / somewhere beneath the table

A silly and mean-spirited article, but Said's Orientalism is intellectually
(rather than politically) controversial in the field. My scholarship on the
matter goies no further.

I hope what I'm going to say now isn't seen as meanspirited or
inappropriate to the moment. The post mortem comments on Said have been for
the most part hagiographic, however, and the man I knew very slightly had
his warts. I was a grad student instructor at Columbia in 1968-1970. My
office faced Said's across the hall, and the doors were usually open, so we
had a lot of accidental contact. The department was famous for its towering
egos, but Said was alone among them in treating all who were not his
students with casual, dismissive contempt. He was said to be a very good
teacher, however.

His considerable courage failed him rather badly on at least one occasion.
C. 1985 he directed the dissertation of a friend of mine. She wrote a
critique of the Trilling legacy, which he encouraged enthusiastically. I
saw his comments on the typescript. Of course the rest of the faculty were
Trillingites and were not amused. It seemed to me at the time that Said had
used my friend as a stalking-horse. When it came to defense time Said
lifted not a finger to save her, and it took her another year to rewrite it.

None of which is to gainsay his considerable importance or even his
kindness and loyalty at least to friends. I'm sorry he's dead, and it's a
real loss, but hagiography tends to inspire disbelief.

Under the Patriot Act - if I understand that law 'correctly' - the Ashcroft
Justice Department has permission to investigate the book buying histories
and Library records of suspects considered a threat to US Security, or
suspects who have terrorised or endangered the lives US officials, etc.

In the case of the White House "leak" that exposed former Ambassador Joseph
Wilson's wife as a CIA operative (a felony), it seems only appropriate that
the Justice Department subpoena such "book" records for all the White House
suspects.

I don't know if this would bring up a quite interesting  (perhaps) series of
"noir" novels. Be interesting to see if French "noir" writers are au courant
in the White House. Or early novels by the Vice President's wife. Given that
the Administration signed on to the Law, I suspect none of the suspects
would be embarrassed by a public knowledge of their reading habits. Unless -
outside of Heritage and American Enterprise Foundation reports, they don't
read much at all. But who knows, that might be a point of honor or religious
reluctance.

Pardon my ignorance, but what is the felony to which you refer?  An
ambassador being married to someone in the CIA, or the leak itself?  Both?
I, too, would like to see a list of books, articles, etc., that the ENTIRE
administration has read...Down to the grounds maintenance personnel...

P.S.  I feel a poem coming on with this one...What fun we could all have

Hi. I take the 'formerly of Connrcticut" is said to let us know that you are
not a person open to just any Californian eccentricity?  Well,  I respond to
put in a good word for some usage of discontinuity in poetry.  In fact, as
best I can recall, hiatus is an attractive feature of your wonderful book
"LaLaLa"? I, for one, dont enjoy walkways that are fenced off and tediously
predictable in their delivery. I'll stop there, in case I have mistaken you
altogether. Yours in friendship, David Bromige.

I've never doubted that Said had his weaknesses -- and I've long disagreed
with his take on many issues in theory --

BUT, as long as we're exchanging anecdotal evidence, which I find myself
doing more in my anecdotage:

I walked up to Edward Said at the Georgetown Theory conference years ago --
I was at the time a wholly unpublished grad student, entirely unknown to
him, a person of not just seeming but real unimportance in the academic
hierarchy -- I found him the most approachable person among the many there
-- he was instantly willing to engage in discussion, was tremendously
encouraging to me, and offered to look at my work (an offer I was too
bashful to take him up on back then, damn it) -- remained friendly as I saw
him in the corridors throughout the conference --

for what it's worth, I found him far more open-minded and far less
egotistic than many other profs I met over the years --

One of the more interesting inanities of the Clinton impeachment saga is on
full display in the Starr report -- Starr's office sent staff over to the
White House to catalogue EVERY book Clinton had -- ostensibly to verify
Lewinsky's testimony regarding gift exchanges (and you MUST read her
thank-you note for the Whitman he gave her!!!!) --

at tax-payer expense, several highly paid individuals devoted many an hour
to the patriot act of checking out the Clinton reading habits ---

That Clinton read at all is grounds for suspicion. Did you ever see a shot
of him getting off a plane without a book in his hand? If there were such,
I must've missed them.

Did you ever see Dubya with a book in his hand? Not me. In fact, the only
time I ever saw him with his hand *on* a book was that day he took his oath
of office (did he have his fingers crossed? I don't remember). Sometimes
he carries a dog off the plane, the helichopper. Sometimes not. Makes ya
wonder, doesn't it?

There are clouds this morning above our Cape Cod, and the Tudor next
door, the Norman French cottage across the street, and the Monterey
colonial painted bright blue behind our house, here in LaLaLand, just as
Mr. West promised. But it is the cuckoo clock, which is not from
Switzerland, the Poles next door operate only during PDST which
fascinates me as I prepare to trip down the aisle, or bridle trail, with
a song in my heart:  I understand its little door opens and closes for
its bird, when I hear it creak as I weed the cosmos blooming along the
white picket fence.

Should I wear white as white as the shingles and the fence, or will it
rain?

Rgds,

My "Pox on Both Your Houses" Palestinian Grocer says this ("leak") event
also reveals that "This shows you the wife of every Ambassador is also
working for the CIA."
I don't think the job constitutes a felony, however, unless you are caught
abroad. But then CIA won't acknowledge you exist.
Professionalizing gossip is an old profession. Heah, many think it's at the
core of literature. Bob Perleman's punditry about "language being the
Riviera of consciousness" can probably easily be converted into "Gossip
being the R....." Gossip just makes the language warmer, if not often hot &
'devilish'. Think Frank O'Hara on a good day. Bristling.

The felony in question is for a government official to knowingly reveal the
identity of a CIA agent.  That seems to be pretty prominently reported in
all the coverage I've seen, so I'm sure what all the confusion's about.

Doubting that the decision-making sessions were audiotaped, I wonder how the
poetry programming for the National Book Festival materialized.  Visit
www.loc.gov/bookfest/programs/pavilions/poetry/index/html for all the
details.  Since Louise Gluck hadn't yet been coronated when choices were
made, can one speculate that Dana Gioia took the lead--perhaps consulting
with Billy Collins, E. Ethelbert Miller, and James Billington?  Whether
Laura Bush was particularly responsible for any of the "chosen poets"
remains unclear to me.  --  Barry Alpert

SCRIBBLED NOTES FROM A COFFEE SHOP:
                     {schitzo-lite}
[ELEMENTS]

The Navels of Ascanio..
Refers to a Locus of Isolation, a Locus Solus, Isole, Islands, Archipeligo

A place which one constantly inhabits but paradoxically [incorporation]
When one arrives in Venice one longs
Never returns to, ie. always arriving elsewhere. (A naval navel, ie
ourobouromphalos)
For delicious candies as big as stars
Stems from a 'traduction' or hoax of the Author by a
With one's La Gazette Automobile
'Hack in need of copy' writing in "La Gazette Automobile" which 'returns'
Tucked under one's lawless arm
A 'symptom' {the little gaze, self-mobilized, or automatic} "the automatic
gaze"
Casting glances in some final allegro
Essentially combining a writing of anarchy with anarchic [the little death?]
Of arriving in the cataracts of good Canaletto
Driving or perhaps a 'gonzo gondolier' like a kind of surfer

Of associations who implies a network a set of tiny canals (very tiny,
insults? tiny spaces!)
A little sleepy from the mooring of the barge
The canals of Venice which have been at many times extremely
Whose hunchbacked boatman 'Gob' is Doge
Polluted bring together 'Gob's Barge' into Garbage. The trans
Whose voice is liquid though gruff as Il Duce
Position of Doge and Duce are taken directly from the Author. (Gob is a
murderer)
Handing his red handkerchief to the Pius cartouche
Utilizing the scholarship of H.M which has found most of the explicit refer

Ences to Italy proper with the Author's Nouv.Impr.Afr. [incorporation]
One can die of
One of which is taken from a phrase here not completed but (God is a
murderer)
Longing in this
Which begins 'Au glas pontifical' which produces another symptom:
Star-anise Labyrinthus
'A glazed pontification', or a Papal Glass, which produces further
Addaged and adduced
Symptoms hear not recorded, As by far many more of the symptoms
Transfixed by transposition
Are not listed, The 'red handkerchief' is actually the letter Mussolini
A puch of prepuce
Wrote to Pope Pius the XI asking that he excommunicate Hitler.
In the composition
This Pius Cartouche is also a symptom relating to the Egyptian

System of royal name writing which relates to another complex
The young wife with hoops
Of symptoms, the rope-like circuit which refers (k)not only to {death of the
Author)
must surely be As(s)can(d)io
Ropes in General but to nooses as methods of execution {suicide}
As Silvio the sylvan sylph
Also loops in the sense of programming, also boundaries [incorporation]
Hides a silvery faced taboo
As in worlds produced by naming IE nation states, identities,
In the water in the bubbles
Figures of thought, etc. Another figure would be the Star-Anise
The boat the gondo-leering canoe
Labyrinthus, which relates to the 'Star Anus' the digestive tract,

The winding streets of Venice, the winding logic of the Author,
*+*
The name of the publication where the Author was shown not

To have written the line of the Hack in La Gazette Automobile.
Riding now in Venetia
'One can die' is obviously 'One Candy' or One Love, One Star-shaped
With candy hiding
Love as big as the Sun, all consuming, all brightness, a kind of
Glances and Gazes
Mad enraptured blossoming, the Author's celebrated Star on
Glazes and Gances
The forehead. Many of the Other Symptoms are left undiscussed
Able Neapolitan
But may relate both to the Author and THE AUTHOR or (voices trapped in
pipes)
Napolean Artaud
The Authorisation of the Author, or perhaps the Auteur or Artaud
sharing a red handkerchief
Of the glow of the letter of the red handkerchief, the kerchief
beneathe the glow
Being itself a kind of iconism of the sneeze, the mischievious
in this age of garbled mischief
Caesura of consciousness where millions of amorphous liquid
with the pontifical Agha
Fragments are ejected into the air, in a kind of invisible colloid
of the monkey sieve
Whose radiational trajectories imply a kind of combustive speech

A material speech whose constituents are the effluvia of the body

Viral matter, codes flung willy-nilly, obviously symbolic of the

Linguistic remainder which figures prominently in the work

The Violence of Language which itself is a discussion of

'Parts' of the Author's work. There is also a work called [incorporation]

_Formal Ambiguity in Early Twentieth Century French Theatre_

by M. Fleisch. (My Flesh?) It focuses on the rare pages found

within a folio of the _Tragoedia Ducis Partibonis_ Venice,

Andrea Quarli 1532 (and Ray Quarles also LAN as in Network)

Essentially recursion and symptoms. Symptoms and Recursions

A Recursing Sympleton. A symptom(s).

"As to the erect purple of the clasp which an oaf..."

"There could be no purer oath to give you"

No where is the relation of prepuce and pudenda discussed.

The Navels of Ascanio..

When one arrives in Venice one longs
For delicious candies as big as stars
With one's La Gazette Automobile
Tucked under one's lawless arm
Casting glances in some final allegro
Of arriving in the cataracts of good Canaletto

A little sleepy from the mooring of the barge
Whose hunchbacked boatman 'Gob' is Doge
Whose voice is liquid though gruff as Il Duce
Handing his red handkerchief to the Pius cartouche

One can die of
Longing in this
Star-anise Labyrinthus
Addaged and adduced
Transfixed by transposition
A puch of prepuce
In the composition

The young wife with hoops
must surely be Ascanio
As Silvio the sylvan sylph
Hides a silvery faced taboo
In the water in the bubbles
The boat the gondo-leering canoe

*+*

Riding now in Venetia
With candy hiding
Glances and Gazes
Glazes and Gances
Able Neapolitan
Napolean Artaud
Sharing a red handkerchief
Beneathe the glow
In this age of garbled mischief
With the pontifical Agha
of the monkey sieve

  just a few weeks ago i heard steve lacy perform, with a singer, poems
he had set by bob kaufman, anne waldman, kenneth rexroth, and jack
kerouac.  i have no idea if these were new or not, but the waldman at
least appeared to be, as the text was a new years poem (?) from just
a few years ago.

The singer Steve Lacy performs with is his wife of thirty years Irene
Aebi.  The songs he did were most likely from his Sunnyside (2003)
release The Beat Suite.  The line-up of the Lacey Quintet on the CD
consists of Steve Lacy: Soprano Sax; Irene Aebi: Vocals; George Lewis:
Trombone; Jean-Jacques Avenal: Bass; and John Betsch: Drums.  Lacy has
been recording jazz and poetry for a quarter century or more, much of it
with Irene Aebi on vocal.  She contributed vocals to Lacy's classic two
disc Futurities ( High Hat, 1985 ) sessions which feature Creeley's
poetry.  Aebi's singing style has been dismissed and even trashed in
many jazz reviews over the years as she doesn't  easily ' fit ' into
alot of pre-conceived notions about how jazz vocals should be presented.
 She is a classically trained musician in violin, viola and voice and
her singing style owes more to European art song than it does to the
traditional vocals styles of Ella, Billie, Sarah et al. Unfortunately
for today's listeners a handful of jazz critics ill informs always
marginalized niche music marketeers that jazz vocals should be only of a
retro-classical style embraced by the neo-cons and exemplified by
singers such as Diana Krall or countless other cookie cutter
interpreters of the ' The (Great) American Songbook.' For a musician
such as Steve Lacy, who apprenticed in ' dixieland bands ' in the '50s,
did journeyman work with the likes of Thelonius Monk and Cecil Taylor
and then took part in the fecund free jazz scene of the 1960s to now
produce work of such uniqueness and maturity is to show what the true
jazz tradition once nurtured and celebrated. When conservative winds
blow it would seem we are left with cool-unto-cold classicist art to
ponder alongside the irony that made it thus... Before meeting Lacy,
Aebi was in San Francisco in the early/mid Sixties and knew Spicer. She
most likely had contact w/ Kaufman and some of the other Beat poets as
well. Lacy and Aebi's interpretations of the poets they have chosen is
unlike anything we've seen in earlier ' jazz poetry ' or poetry put to
jazz; indeed it is nothing short of remarkable. The Beat Suite is an
ambitious project that deserves wider attention and I would encourage
anyone interested in jazz and poetry to seek it out. The tracks on Beat
Suite are as follows:

1. Wave Lover - Kerouac
2. Song - Ginsberg
3. Naked Lunch - Burroughs
4. Private Sadness - Kaufman
5. Ring of Bone - L. Welch
6. The Mad Yak - Corso
7. Jack's Blues - Creeley
8. Agenda - Spicer
9. In the Pocket - Waldman/Schelling
10. Mother Goose - Rexroth

I've been fascinated for several years by the Museum of Jurassic

You can find this text and maybe other delightful musings (or shams) in:

which looks as though it's pretty widely held in libraries.

Excerpt from Implexures
Molecules might not have been as confused as I thought probable, the two
from the northern hemisphere less seven and a return to places in it for all
three within half those years. The dog was quarantined. So to Saxon Doom
from Norse Lag always defying definition as many marriages attest. Elsewhere
(the word emblematic of my vocabulary) other photographs were taken, letters
direct us to “Mc or Mac” no longer prefixed island surnames. In the Sudan
the Anwar Dam covers the spot exactly (planes had propellers then) and figs
greeted us to so many palms.
The disappointments of a generation skewed by cynicism or performance mean
the wars inhabit some individuals on an ongoing basis and not only those of
the twenty-first century. Cousins married each other more often than not, an
act perhaps “devastating to humour.” Recognize the ache for what it is,
reside there, not knowing opinions, hear a rosary of sunsets with the bells.
Disowned as much for himself as her English one. (One false step beyond the
Cliffs of Moher into the fog and so to sea.)
For these are the characters — sense of direction, observed movements, “time
of our lives.” The tableaux run through themselves. To absorb a history of
family through the centuries requires a forebear’s attention to facts and no
fear of paper. Remember this. The nights are a time of chosen light, days an
elaborate grafting.

"Orientalism" is controversial in the way that the bible is controversial.
It is the ur-text for numerous academic trends.  Of course it is not
inerrant and of course there are inadequacies in it--Said's project is
mostly critical, so it is hard to say what would be the appropriate stance
to take for a western critic--but like all such books it has to be engaged
with.  I have read that it killed area studies, such that people have
become more wary of writing about THE Arab Mind, as if such a thing
existed.  And to the extent that people are aware that public discourse
regularly trades in regurgitated cliches about Arabs and Muslims, he is
partly responsible.

In English Studies it undoubtedly is the most influential Foucaultian
study of literature.  One should say that it actually supplements and
extends Foucault, since F's concern is Power pure and simple, while Said's
is Power and Colonialism.  Before Said, there simply were not studies that
even related colonialism to literature and culture.  Now there is a whole
subdiscipline, not all of which is derivative of Said or Foucault.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

STORIES

This project or "act of compostion" is not an exercise in chance operations, or in rearranging
source material or diffusing the role of the unitary author. It is not influenced by the avant-garde
traditions. It is not confined to the level of formal arrangement nor does it follow the signature
characteristics of contemporary experimental poetry with its emphasis on procedures. These
experimentalist practices are sublimely uninspired.

Each STORY in this ouevre is an intensely motivated message with contrasting lyrical passages set
against a neutrally stable landscape. Streams of echoes follow moments of deep stillness. Images
with deep interlocks that defy the most rigorous intellectual analysis interplay between the spatial
and cognitive. The resolution of ambiguities is achieved neither through obscurities nor patterns of
centers. The total infiltration of originary content and intention ("subject matter") is the
psychogeographical identity of my work through which unbroken light emerges, the light preceding
language and the defense mechanisms of conscious thought.

These are the first 20 Stories from an anthology.

TRIPLETS

These are the first 20 triplets from a epic-length poem (one million triplets) that is being written
to expound upon the important lessons of life, lessons that are not displayed on the surface of the
poems but are revealed from the very heart of the writing. Woven into these valuable lessons are
passages expressing every shade of personal feeling, emotions which nearly everyone feels, including
those that both arouse and naturally arise from reflection.

La Tazza, 108 Chestnut St. Philadelphia

Bhanu Kapil Rider's publications are a book of poetry, The Vertical
Interrogation of Strangers (Kelsey St. Press), and a chapbook of prose,
Autobiography of a Cyborg (Leroy Press), forthcoming as a full-length book from
Leon Works. She has recently completed a novel, The Wolfgirls of Midnapure. Whe

Reading Report:

The new season kicked off with Baltimore’s Chris Toll reading passages from his
flying saucer bible. He unleashed the mike & continued with his measured
intensity, like hate reads a newspaper. He held the room hostage. Poetry was a
raygun in the hand of a Bigfoot. Kim Soli made interpretive balloon animals
while Chris read his poems.

Deborah Richards delivered a collaborative performance with Kamili Feelings &
Alicia Askenase, set in the B&W film era. Her middle piece was a kind creation
myth- of the Republic of Congo. They performed the title piece of Deborah’s new
book, Last One Out from back to front. It was a kind of rewind that exposed the
process of the piece set in process.

Nicole & I joined Fran Ryan at Sarah Katz’s 30th birthday party in Fishtown,
where N chatted w/ old filmmaker friends & I argued w/ a guy defending his
father’s gripe against the Mural Arts Program. We retired to Dirty Frank’s &
met Hassen & CA in the doorway, straight from the airport.

I just heard third hand that different contingents of a group called the
Gorilla Mothers (GMs) wonderfully and outrageously confronting Arnold as he
takes his four bus campaign for California Governor tour north towards
Sacramento. At each campaign stop, the Gorilla Mothers - apparently a new
generation of the legendary Gorilla Girls - strategically positions groups
of 50 to 100 fully costumed black and brown Gorillas in front the
Candidate's podium. Taking a cue from Claus Oldenberg's early work, each
Gorilla is wearing a huge hat in the form of a thick pink and white marbled
paper meche breast, each one topped with a very sensuous looking conical
tangerine nipple.

The Gorilla Mothers are reported to being carrying signs that variously
read, "We've got what you want, Arnold", "Grope & Speak", "Are we big
enough?", "Don't Forget Us at the Polls."

At the first demonstration in Hollywood, the Mothers apparently flustered
Arnold almost to pieces. Straining to keep his eyes off the crowd of bobbing
breasts, he was said to keep repeating, as he has since yesterday, "I will
be the champion of women. I will be the champion of women."

Can anybody down the coast confirm this rumor? The images haven't gotten on
to Fox or CNN yet.

Let me know,

Stephen Vincent

A figure that I find quite fascinating in the various conversations is Andre
Glucksmann.  I read one of his books years ago, but he seems to have shifted
positions.  He considers himself to be a leftist, but he is also tricky.  He
doesn't always follow the political line.  Yesterday I read a great editorial by
him in the Wall Street Journal.  But this interview sparks all kinds of interest
in me, and sends the general political line in many directions with which I
mostly or entirely agree:

http://www.hrvc.net/articles/glucksmann2.html

I'm mostly glad to be in a pluralist society in which there are many different
viewpoints and that leads to gridlock.  I would hate for this country to come to
some kind of hideous agreement such that only the left was right, or only the
right was left.  I think it's a good thing to have a kind of balance in the house
and senate such that they can block one another, and just don't want the balance
to tip too far in any direction.  But what I would also like is for the left to
be more iconoclastic toward itself, and for the right as well.  It seems that in
the polarization that's taking everybody on the left sounds alike, and so too on
the right.

In Europe there are fifty parties in even smaller countries, so you hear a lot
more viewpoints.  At least there are still two here.

Edward Said sounds like everybody else to me, I'm sorry to say.  I was grateful
to hear about him burning the graduate student.  It's the only time I've ever
heard anybody say anything against him while remaining more or less on the same
side.  The other side just hates him, and won't hear anything he had to say.

Glucksmann is very marginal, and doesn't have a wave to follow him.  I appreciate
people like this.  Generally you have to be on one side or the other to be
heard.  Glucksmann is also interested in having us hear about people whose
positions are so complex, such as the Chechnyans, that neither the right nor the
left wish to discuss them in this country.

Forgive me if this has come up already; we're on "digest" over here...

It is common knowledge (or so it was thought) that il presidente is
literate, and that he reads on his knees, the same book, one page
every day. His text is -My Utmost for His Highest-, by Oswald
Chambers (you can read along with the boss a
http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/utmost -- today's gloss is pasted
below). It is not certain how frequently he consults the good book
itself. It seems his theodicy is coming out cliff's notes. No just
war lore there, I don't think.

More accts of the habit:

The Place of Ministry

He said to them, 'This kind [of unclean spirit] can come out by nothing
but prayer and fasting'
-Mark 9:22

His disciples asked Him privately, 'Why could we not cast it out?' "
( Mark 9:28 ). The answer lies in a personal relationship with Jesus
Christ. "This kind can come out by nothing but" concentrating on Him,
and then doubling and redoubling that concentration on Him. We can
remain powerless forever, as the disciples were in this situation, by
trying to do God's work without concentrating on His power, and by
following instead the ideas that we draw from our own nature. We
actually slander and dishonor God by our very eagerness to serve Him
without knowing Him.

When you are brought face to face with a difficult situation and
nothing happens externally, you can still know that freedom and
release will be given because of your continued concentration on
Jesus Christ. Your duty in service and ministry is to see that there
is nothing between Jesus and yourself. Is there anything between you
and Jesus even now? If there is, you must get through it, not by
ignoring it as an irritation, or by going up and over it, but by
facing it and getting through it into the presence of Jesus Christ.
Then that very problem itself, and all that you have been through in
connection with it, will glorify Jesus Christ in a way that you will
never know until you see Him face to face.

We must be able to "mount up with wings like eagles" ( Isaiah 40:31
), but we must also know how to come down. The power of the saint
lies in the coming down and in the living that is done in the valley.
Paul said, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" (
Philippians 4:13 ) and what he was referring to were mostly
humiliating things. And yet it is in our power to refuse to be
humiliated and to say, "No, thank you, I much prefer to be on the
mountaintop with God." Can I face things as they actually are in the
light of the reality of Jesus Christ, or do things as they really are
destroy my faith in Him, and put me into a panic?

Subject:      MCCAFFERY & DREYER READING TOMORROW
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Join us tomorrow, Saturday, October 4, as we kick off the 2003-04 Segue
Series at Bowery Poetry Club with readings by Lynne Dreyer and Steve
McCaffery

The Bowery Poetry Club is at 308 Bowery, just north of Houston, in NYC.
Segue readings run from 4:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m. $5 admission goes to support
the readers.

LYNNE DREYER's books and chapbooks include: Lamplights Used to Feed the
Deer; Stampede; Step Work; The Letters; Tamoka; The White Museum; and a
round-robin "intraview" with Joan Retallack, Phyllis Rosenzweig, and Tina
Darragh.

About The White Museum: "What an aewsome factory or heartbeat this indeed
is, the endless references to male-and female-ness getting subsumed in the
open mouths of both, emerging with the new remedies of the ancient years.
--Bernadette Mayer

Lynne Dreyer is currently working on a new project, Catch As Catch Can.
Don't miss this rare NYC appearance!

STEVE MCCAFFERY was a founding member of the Four Horsemen and is as
prolific and influential a critic as he is a poet. His 20-odd books include:
The Cheat of Words; Prior to Meaning: the Protosemantic and Poetics; and the
two-volume selected and previously uncollected Seven Pages Missing. One of
our most adventurous poets.

A full bio, an interview, and various writings, can be found on Steve
McCaffery's EPC home page, at:

Lots of leftists in the US, but very few in government. I would be able to
agree a bit more with your position if, for instance, there were a block of
senators or representatives pushing for socialized medicine (which, by the
standards of most of the rest of the world, is a pretty moderate
position)--there are one or two. And so on for a slew of other issues. The
legislative balance, such as it is, pits the right against the mildly left
of center.

Quite right, Mark. There are some leftists left, but if Bush has any
luck with his No Child Left education policy, there'll soon be none.

If you're in or around San Francisco in October, don't miss these two
plays produced by foolsFURY, an excellent local theater company with a
penchant for verse drama.  The Mrozek plays are in prose, but I saw the
previews last night and they're terrific.  Anyone have info on the
playwright?

Hi!
I am new to the site and would like to get some feedback on a couple of
poems I have.  They were originally published in a locally (Artvoice -
Buffalo, NY, rights were reverted back to me) and am looking for appropriate
national or international markets.  I should note that most of my poems are
on short side in length.  Any advice or feedback is greatly appreciated.
Thanks!
Keri


Crossing Guard

In match stick towns
Emphysema cowboys mingle
With old women in blue wish scarves
Fallen leaf sidewalks
Lead to begging counting houses
Plaid skirt girls chase knotted tie boys
Heavy brass marks the start of the day


Sunday Night at 10 O’clock

Stressed neon flits against
Cracked dirty asphalt
Chain smokers exchange confessions
In tinted SUVs
The underemployed grab tonight’s six-pack
As a middle aged man picks up a hooker in a rain streaked rabbit coat
I buy some chicken and roll into the night

Suburban Manifesto

Management

Deductive thoughts use existing theories to predict behavior about phenomena
we cannot control .  The scope of our studies, inclusion and exclusion.  The
Lingua Morta exhibition brought forth new artists and Photos of Milan's
Mussolini-era railway station dwarfed by masks, naked heroes and God knows
what other kitsch.

The Fascism of Café and magazine kiosks  big Italians selling De Cecco Pasta
and imported cheese.  Among the assorted sculptures the grotesque  nudes
imitating Michelangelo made from imported Gorgonzola. Gollum in Lord of the
Rings is  a weirdly emaciated Etruscan vase. Is there something inherently
fascistic, in the post-post-modern age? Art is fetishism hand-crafted
objects tied in a harness of pleasure and Frosted Flakes. A critical vice
identifies and rejects political correctness and yearns for a iron wrench
hitting us squarely in the face.

Marketing

“the avant-garde is the best marketing tool”  Andy Warhol

public art celebrating victory is a desolate pastiche. The country that gave
New York its name never arrived at a final definition of what patriotic art
might be.  Deeper scrutiny of cultural constructs such as humanness and
materialism rip open wounds healed long ago.Identity is a commodity to be
fashioned into a  look or equated with a 'cool' lifestyle. Metaphoric
inflections are difficult to decode. As long as things are simple and bright
who cares about how they are made.

Advertising

“Everytime I hear the Word Culture I reach for my revolver” Heinrich Himmler

The original cool of  the twentieth century is the  city, noisy with
stimulating background against which people attempted to transact their
business and maintain a private peace.  Intrusive urban backgrounds
influenced the individual's sense of identity. Urban fashion provides a
means of acquiring multiple lives. The transformative properties of fashion,
are an expectation of every new purchase. Coolness, which provided a buffer
between yourself and the rush of the everyday. Ameliorate losses and listen
for bones breaking and nerves tearing.

Diversity

Feb 19, 1937,Addis Ababa, a bomb exploded an attempt to kill Italian viceroy
Rodolfo Graziani.. terrorists did this horrible act.  The fashion Catwalks
are Italy-centered and they are more  subtle than any T-shirt can display.
Cannibalization for every position on the political spectrum continues.
Sartorial cycle of haute couture  the prevalence of cross-dressing ensures
openness to a suburban lifestyle.

Family Values

The  People’s simplicity is the understanding that assertions of  urgency
are  personal. Problems of post-modernity are true the fashion industries
are deeply implicated in the manufacture of 'personality'. Women’s lives in
the third world  are made better by hard work and 80 hours a week of sewing.
“ Women whose fingers are damaged by needles will not be allowed into work
because the blood will reduce our quality output and they will not be paid”.

Docile

Shape and rearrange yourself in accordance with the Pilates method.
Pontius Pilate dealt with terrorists.

Ala Mode

David Bowie & Madonna a la mode pie with tabloids and torn tendons  fine
meals taken out of trash bins served warm from the summer sun.  Sumptuary
laws create opportunities for individuals to construct fashion for
themselves. Flexibile  self-representation a post-modernity forged from
shared evaluation of aesthetic bruises.  Emphasize seductiveness a Cartesian
formulation cult of celebrity using figures A polymorphic sexuality. Grey
areas are the most defined.

Technology

The Permeable identity questions stable boundaries of technological love.  A
nip and a tuck and we are full and moist again. Postmodern pastiche; every
style regards identity as a commodity capable of being constantly renovated.
Renovation TV shows that make everyone happy and fill them with joy.
Assumptions of the self precipitates  deeper scrutinizing of  cultural
constructs. The construction of houses with the Balloon Frame Method is
temporary and creates an artificial place.   Prized metaphysical qualities
such as character and morality are fluid

Gourmet Kitchens

Contextualizing urban fashion provides a means of acquiring multiple lives.
In the fantasy world ‘truth’ is ignored but ‘facts are stubborn things.’
What are they thinking? What are they wearing?

Transformative properties of fashion are an expectation that every new
purchase will cause wholeness. Proscriptiveness no longer appeals because of
the desire for  stable interiorized sense of identity

Cannibalization of every position on the political spectrum continues as
part of sartorial cycle.  Cannibals are what we are now eating our young to
satiate ourselves. Ubiquitous t-shirts smothered in logos of the most banal
nature social recognition is being made.

Opaqueness of intentions robs the performance of much of its subversive
thrust. Ornamentation and innovation continually reinvent subjectivity.

Nascarism

Classicism, art deco, the international style, abstract art, figurative art,
traditionalism, modernism.  NASCAR is the most profitable sport in these
United States. Hundreds of thousands of people attend races every weekend.
They are all begun with the singing of the national anthem and a prayer.

De Chirico loses himself in the eternal dead Italian piazze  he gave
metaphysical painting a public agenda. The deep past is the unavoidable
presence in Italy.  A love-hate relationship that Italian artists revered
and wanted to destroy history. Mega-Churches are growing everywhere the
seating is the most important aspect.  The seats are purchased from cinema
companies so that people can relax but they need to have a little spring to
facilitate the altar calls.

Liutpriand of Cremona was the ambassador of the German Emperor to the court
of the Byzantines.  He tried to bring purple cloth home to Lombardy but it
was taken from him. Byzantines only allowed purple to be worn by emperors.
Botticelli's The Birth of Venus was sent to a salt mine during the bombing
of Florence. NASCAR events are paid for by the sponsorships on the cars and
the smoking of cigarettes.

Baroque art is propaganda.


Cultural Practice

the surface does not resolve the constant ambiguity of whether a look is
confrontational or has global implications; and how the physiognomic
assumptions embedded in the fashionable look conceal a quaint history  of
reactions to the end of the millenary industry.

The balance/ desire and realization, between valuing objects and having the
capacity to maintain a lost lifestyle is the fundamental dynamic of fashion.
Gourmet Groceries and home improvement shows allow us to fill our nests with
tin foil and discarded thread.

Casual sandals with socks colonial echoes of inappropriate hats and
carryalls. Muslims, Jews, Hare Krishnas, Catholics, New Agers, all make
themselves visible with obvious religious insignias. Middle aged Buddhists
and Zoroastrian Ice Cream sundaes make the day delightful.

Mega fauna/Mega churches

The Association between appearance and character remains common. Mammoths
once roamed in the Midwest along with giant beavers the size of houses if
you believe in evolution.  Stereotyping  race and gender naturalizes the
appearances of public figures such as politicians, pop singers and movie
stars  brown eyes have all been used to signify character. Ideologies
merchandise a 'look' and sell their products accordingly. To be
confrontational or affirmational is indeterminate.  Paleo-Indians used to
drive giant bison off of cliffs and kill hundreds of them at one time, they
would eat their fill but many would die from too much protein. Bibles used
are covered in leather with fine, gold page edges.

Crossing the Rio Grande

non-American ethnic groups, professional tennis players and weekend
rollerbladers, are  subverting meaning. A sign of social crisis. Moloch has
absorbed yet another attempt at oppositional dress military-style
cross-cultural practice. The hobby of 'people watching' cited as a sign of a
rich inner life is a sign of failure. Shopping Malls are not public places
so no ideas may be expressed.

The Business of Sofas

Western history is confident of uselessness.  With some justification
reading the surface is indicative of other, less obvious gnosis but Sadly,
historical amnesia is the norm.

Martin Sheen in the British Airways Lounge

Draconian laws are enjoying strong support by the orthodox of the country,
thus lending the regime cover for the price of chocolate pudding pops.  The
Implied threaten the power of the elite.

Dean and De Luca Aroma

It is all depressing stuff, if you like ancient Roman, or Renaissance or,
for that matter, Etruscan art this is kitsch at best. Is there something
inherently fascistic, in the modern age, about worshipping the art of the
past, genuflecting before old statues or paintings?

"War is beautiful because it initiates the dreamt-of metallisation of the
human body." Filippo Tommaso Marinetti.

The art galleries are full, the concert halls are packed so tight that
fleshy posteriors touch the sides of the metal arms and the gourmet stores
are filled with every Earthly delight. Diarrhea is what concerns most people
when they have not found the Foie Gras.  Sewers are a luxury item. Volvo’s
indicate a concern for the developing world.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I'm putting together a seminar on poetry reviewing for students interested
in becoming literary critics, kind of a vocational-practical course. I'd
very much appreciate if someone could mention any English language
interesting contemporary poetry critics or texts on poetic reviewing
(anything ranging from journal issues dealing with the state of poetry
criticism today to avant-garde/radical political value debates). I'm
especially interested in alternative or "experimental" approaches.
Thanks,
Fred Hertzberg, Helsinki

Mark Weiss,

What would be the real costs of socialized medicine?  Where would the money come
from?   What would you cut, or would you raise taxes? In Finland, for instance, the
taxes are very high.  I paid about forty percent.  I had a better lifestyle as a
graduate student in Seattle.  The top prof paid sixty percent taxes.  His lifestyle
wasn't much better than mine.  Doctors make about forty thousand, and secretaries
about twenty thousand.  The taxes then further equalize.  There is no money left to
make anyone rich.  What are the first implications of this?  There are no private
colleges or universities in Finland because nobody can afford them.  The government
is the only source of money.  Every penny has to be spent in such a way that it
makes sense to the people.  The disappearance of creative writing programs, the
disappearance of private universities.  There is one person in Finland who works on
aesthetics at the University of Helsinki.  Something like ten percent of the
population is able to go to college.  You have to pass rigorous tests.  Here,
something like 82 percent go.

The funny part about this is that at least half this board would lose their own
jobs if the socialist ideas that they espouse came to pass.

Stanford would collapse, as would Harvard, RISD, and all the other top institutions
that charge 40 grand or so for tuition.  The superrich would move to offshore
locations.  Of course, the good part is you wouldn't ever be asked for a quarter. I
never was, even once, in Finland, or in any of the other Scandinavian countries
I've visited.  Even the unemployed have enough.  But the superrich Finns move to
Miami.  They'd go somewhere else if we started to tax them at 90%, which is what
some are taxed in Finland to make the social programs solvent.

Maybe there's some part of this socialist idea that I haven't understood, and maybe
there is some way to pay for it that I haven't seen.  In France, however, the money
comes out of public education.  First, very few can go.  Second, those who do go
are put into worn out buildings, and made to undergo rigorous testing to get them
out.  There isn't even any money for basic maintenance.  If you can stay in, and
make it through, then you can maybe get a job as a prof that pays less than what a
secretary makes in a good college here.  Maitre de conference positions (which are
equal to assistant professor positions here) pay you so little that the only way
most people make ends meet is to have a wealthy spouse, or to live without
children.  If we had socialized medicine, the money would come from somewhere, and
my best guess is that education money would be slashed, and we'd lose two thirds of
our colleges and those remaining would be chronically strapped.

I wonder what your resident expert Elizabeth thinks of Bush's poetry;

most unfortunately, this is NOT a joke. Check out CNN.

kirby, i'm tempted to ask a rhetorical question like, So it's a good
thing that .01% of the u.s. public earns as much per year as the
bottom 34,000,000?... it's a good thing that 400 people in the u.s.
are worth $955,000,000,000?... that this is why we have so many great
public institutions, like harvard? (the 2nd richest non-profit
institution in the world, i believe, behind the roman catholic
church, with an endowment just over
$19,000,000,000)...

nobody here is talking some pure form of socialism, and we certainly
don't have a pure form of capitalism... and i don't think you're
going to find anyone on the list putting forth a new economic policy,
just like that... but it seems to me that to justify profit-motive of
the sort we see now "in" this country (scare quotes to point to
globalization, privatization, transnationalization) on the backs,
say, of the 34,000,000 in this country below the poverty line, or the
45,000,000 w/o health insurance (someone please correct me if my
numbers are off), is a bit, well, precious anyway... you probably
don't mean to suggest quite this, i know... but i remain a bit in awe
of the suggestion, as i read your post, that there *is* a
justification for our many social ills if we would only look e.g. at
our great public institutions vis-a-vis finland's...

btw, i enjoyed your letter---that is you, right?---in the newest
~pmla~ re the apparent crisis in scholarly publishing... but i happen
to think there's a crisis in publishing across the board---which most
on this list are probably all too aware of... ergo i wouldn't have
come at that issue from the perspective of those individual scholars
who presumably haven't the right stuff for the job (which is a fair
way of summarizing much of your response, yes?)... instead i would
observe that the profession should have and could have been wringing
its hands over this matter years ago---had members, by and large,
paid any attention at all to the small press publishing situation...

best,

joe

     i didn't understand your reply.  Perhaps my request was not clear.  I'm

Let's see, we might spend less on the military. And sure, higher taxes.

But let's be real for a moment. College attendance in the US is primarily a
class marker and remedial education for the virtually non-existent
education in high school and earlier. The level of education of people in
all classes in places like France, Scandinavia, Australia, and Cuba, to
name a few, is simply astonishing to an American.

A case in point--I spent four days travelling in the Australian outback
with a group that included a young Australian welder. He was at the top of
his profession, medical welding, which is also very high status among
working class jobs, but was bored with it and thinking about going to
university. He had always liked numbers, and he thought accounting would be
fun. He was absolutely confident about his ability to make the transition.
He also knew that he wouldn't have to mortgage his soul to pay the tuition
or give up his health insurance.

In France at least (and probably in other places) there'sa superb system of
safe, progressive, tax-supported child care that virtually all are entitled
to.

What you're missing is that in exchange for what you see as the
stultification caused by the difficulty of getting rich Americans live with
a degree of insecurity, because of what we like to call our medical system,
and because of worries about the care and education of our children, that
people in other industrialized counrtries don't experience. The difference
is instantly apparent in the way people carry themselves, and also the
daring with which, like my welder friend, they lead their lives. That goes
for aretists, too.

Of course it also helps that in other industrialized countries people work
shorter hours and have more vacation time.

And they don't pay the cost, which you may feel less than I do, of being
constantlt confronted with human misery on a baroque scale.

By the way, I myself wouldn't cry over the loss of creative writing
programs, altho I consent to feed at that trough once in a while. If indeed
in exchange there were decent universal health insurance or decent
affordable child care I'd consider it a bargain.

By the way again, most of those same countries that are bereft of writing
programs subsidize the arts, and also publishing, to a far greater degree
than the US.

Mime-version: 1.0

Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

from today's NY Daily News:

Bush's sublime rhyme

Who said President Bush doesn't have a way with words?

"President Bush is a great leader and a husband, but I bet you didn't know
he is also quite the poet," Laura Bush told a gathering at the U.S. Library
of Congress yesterday.

When the First Lady returned home from her recent five-day solo trip through
Europe, "I found a lovely poem waiting there for me," she said.

Maybe it was the two kisses on her hand from French President Jacques Chirac
that prompted the President to immortalize her in a love poem.

As her husband watched quietly, she recited it.

"Dear Laura," the poem began, "Roses are red, violets are blue, oh my lump
in the bed, I miss you.

"The distance, my dear, has been such a barrier, next time you want an
adventure, just land on a carrier."

“This fine system was
Founded in the forests.”
It was then taken out
Into the plains of
Smaller islands,
Squeezed beneath the palms,
And rendered unto a
Newer pleaser, pleased
By & by as long as it
Keeps on comin’,
Growing past the hands.

Now.  We the forests thought
These grims to be
So delicate, . . .
So right we were;
Back to the handsaw
And the hawk,
Or is it a handsaw
Or a dove?

  A day before Edward Said died..an IDF soldier in the West Bank
was killed accidentally by a bulldozer demolishing a house..the driver
sd he hadn't seen the soldier...eerily similiar to the driver who hadn't seen
Rachel Corie the American innocent killed in a work accident...

  Over the summer I reread Leon Uris' EXODUS...pretty much unreadable..
except for the first chapter in Cyprus....."monkeys &.....Uris book was a
deliberate propaganda page-turner...it's not  so subtle message was that Isreaeli
Jews were like us... the 50's US...the great American lonely affluent society crowd.....&
that  ARABS were other...Otto Preminger technicolored  this replete with Goyim ..i.e.
Sal Mineo...for those few who couldn;t or wouldn't read....

  Said's ORIENTALISM & COLONIALISM and LIT.....tho immediately unreadable will
be seen by  the next generation much the same way...as acts of propaganda..Said after
all is just Arafat's bad conscience...Said's genius was to identify his target audience..
the Post 'Nam generation of Academics....angry women...gays...afro-americans...radical
retreads...who would control the Liberal Arts depts...and needed somethin' to teach...
just as the previous class had latched on to French solopsism and structuralism....and the
one before that to the self-congragulations of the New Anatomy of Criticism...or as they
say in the faculty dining room...I read Heidegger & Cornel West is no Sidney Hook let alone Heidegger..

   Said's not so subtle message was that Arabs were like US....moreover they were like him..
suave well dressed musical and given to the tears of compassion...Said was quite willing to
demolish most of Western Lit. & Hist. to get his message across...as were that new generation
of academic bureaucrats....who hadn't yet settle down on their sitzfleisch before they were
willing to demolish the Canon...

   Said work was one great anti...it never offered a  positive vision of what the Orient of Arabs or
the East was...it knew IT just wan't what the West thought it was...Westerners were thus Orientalized
in reverse...chillingly it forgot that the greatest text of Orientalism...was about the Jews...the Rialto.
Belmont...and the Merchant...& that all of Said's work could have just put in Jew for Arab...without
missing a European hip-hop off beat...

    Said's success in propagandizing a generation...masked his position as a spokesmen fot the
Palestinian cause...& as a triple outsider...Non-palestinian..non muslim...non Catholic...he had
to out A Arafat...which he did...rather the repudiating terrorism...Said was its  inevitable spokesman..
the rock throwing was no accident...it never is...Said position's which swung from two states to one..,
from tears to more of his own suffering...idealized the Infantada by never offering any vision of
a compromise...and by the end in the Articles for El Arum...the Egyptian state newspaper...we are
very close to straight Anti-Semitism & Oritentalism...


    So we after all...are all guilty..of what we accuse the other of....nicht wahr..DRn....


    Yom Kippur...576x...

I would think Bush's poetry would be more lyric like Virgil

" i sing of arms and of a man; the fat had made him fugitive, he was the
first to journey from the fields of crawford as far as Washington and the
Chesapeake shore. There was an ancient city called Babylon a colony of
refugees from the evil ones

OPERA: Poems 1981-2002
By Barry Schwabsky

525 West 22nd Street

ADVANCE WORDS ON OPERA:
The word "song" resonates over and over and the poems here will often
suddenly burst into an intricate, complicated melody.
--Juliana Spahr

His poetry is exactly as strange as the familiar may permit. His work, born
of a strange encounter between American poetry and European masters such as
Celan and Novalis, always surprises me by its exploratory investigations. He
writes one of the most loving poetries today, filled with a sexual myth as strong
as anyone's.
--David Shapiro

These might be choruses and arias from some lost Venetian music drama of the
early 1600s--an allegory of the nature of light and of desire, set on one of
those abandoned islands where every imaginable encounter becomes
possible--transmuted over the intervening centuries of silence into a software program for a
new species of lyrical electronica.
--Geoffrey O'Brien

Imagine poems written by Sir Walter Raleigh after he has read Wittgenstein
and Lorine Neidecker, listened to bands whose names weren't in the air but whose
one song was on the airwaves, and learned more about contemporary art than
anyone thought possible, and you might get a sense of the compactness of these
poems, an airy abstract density unlike anyone else's.
--John Yau

Join us at 4:00 p.m. this coming Saturday, October 11, for "In Others'
Words: Parody & Pastiche."

"I am seriously interested in your parody."--Anselm Berrigan

& so, so are we. *And* your pastiche. So much so, in fact, we've invited
five poets:

Charles Bernstein
Brandon Downing
Jack Kimball
Brendan Lorber
Michael Magee

who-occasionally or perennially-"write through" others (names, texts and
lexicons) for this, the first Segue Parody & Pastiche Party.

(Note: Because Katie Degentesh, Drew Gardner and Ben Friedlander -- who were
listed in previous announcements -- are unable to make this reading, Charles
Bernstein has graciously agreed to step in.)

self-help for joyless pleasure


do you cut pages in books, transform subjects to clipped hedges?
have you been wanting?
felt like reading jean genet?
will burn and expose double meaning without meaning to?
this is thick; do you understand?
during an asthma attack do you have your pinks, reds and blacks ready
and in order?
have you felt mute after words?
thought of horizontal clairvoyance more and more; later in silent
tragedy poised in the temptation of a smile?
have your ever uttered the words; I am trying to locate a sophocles; a
joyous presence, a joyless pressure, the last joy of a ray of hope?
ended up in deep ended nothing tones saying things through pinholes?
did you notice if the pinholes were perched on stiletto heels, offering
  abstract lip solutions hanging from something suffering memory?
do you cut holes out of edges hoping to expose horizontal thoughts only
to find they left in a winks notice to another room?

Small Press Traffic presents
Friday, October 10, 2003 at 7:30 p.m.
Brenda Coultas & Brian Strang

Lisa Jarnot calls Brenda Coultas "the supreme weaver of tender weird tales for
a melancholy democracy. Her rural-urban-lyric-documentary of the human
condition is more than astute and more than compelling-think of her as the new
breed of great American poet." And Rain Taxi says of Coultas? new book, A
Handmade Museum (Coffee House Press, 2003): "[Her] poems sometimes seem to
function as an extension of the observational activities by which
neighborhoods regulate themselves; in her descriptions of encounters with
people on the street and objects found in dumpsters, she preserves the
naturally elegant social organization of the Bowery in its original chaos?".
Coultas? previous works include A Summer Newsreel (2nd Story Books, 1999). She
joins us from NYC.

Aaron Shurin says Brian Strang?s first full-length book, Incretion (Spuyten
Duyvil, 2003), "maps a post-apocalyptic future which is the present; in other
words, our mortal occasion. There's lament - a dirge that lacks bitterness
because it loves what is lost - and an elegiac language of the daily. But
there's scariness, too - the tension of a noir narrative emptying itself of
details, places, persons, placements, that have the ring of familiarity: our
own necropolis. This is not a pretty book, as is true of many honest mirrors,
but an imperative one." Strang teaches at San Francisco State, is co-editor of
26 magazine; previous works include movement of avenues in rows (a+bend) and
machinations (Duration ebooks).

Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to SPT members,
and CCAC faculty, staff, and students.
Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in
Timken Lecture Hall
California College of Arts and Crafts
1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the intersection of 16th &
Wisconsin)

!!! The Perpetual Motion Roadshow returns this month on October 11th,
this Saturday, at Bluestockings on the Lower East Side.
Thanks to those of you who came to the September show - if you did
you're probably appearing on TV in Toronto as I write this - I hoped you
liked it. You at least learned how to make a pipe out of an apple.

This month's show features great writing and videos - see details below
- we'll start at 8 pm -rather sharply - as always it's free - and there
will be great independent books to check out.

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 11th. 8 pm. Perpetual Motion Roadshow.
With working class punk scribe Sean Carswell from L.A., rock n roll cut
n paster Jennifer Whiteford from Ottawa, and superficial storyteller
Mickey Hess from Louisville. Plus NYC's Graham Willoughby and videos by
All Day Breakfast. FREE
Bluestockings Bookstore, 172 Allen St. at Stanton. (F train 2nd Ave)
212.777.6028

The Perpetual Motion Roadshow is an indie press tour circuit with
monthly stops in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, New York, Cleveland,
Cincinnati and Chicago. For this month's schedule, go to
www.nomediakings.net.

The Actants
--------------

Sean Carswell is a former carpenter, house-painter, dishwasher,
professor, bartender, warehouse clerk, and anything else you can think
of. Currently, he ekes out a living as a co-founder/editor of both
Razorcake Magazine and Gorsky Press. He’s the author of Drinks for the
Little Guy and Glue and Ink Rebellion, and his fiction and non-fiction
-- often indistinguishable -- has appeared in dozens of mainstream and
underground (mostly underground) publications. For the good of everyone
around him, he stopped drinking whiskey, but that won’t keep him from
telling you some stories.

Firmly planted in Ottawa, Ontario, Jennifer Whiteford started zining in
1990 to cope with high school and began publishing her perzine, Matilda,
four years ago. Jennifer’s writing has also appeared in other
publications including Vamp, Turbo Chicks, Fireweed, & Ladyfest music
festival programs. Jennifer plays guitar and sings in the all-girl indie
band Sophomore Level Psychology. Her performance on the Roadshow marries
rock music, non-fiction, and a small dose of nostalgic teenage angst.

Mickey Hess lives in Louisville, Kentucky, city of Colonel Sanders'
grave and the KFC world headquarters. Author of Nobody Likes a Smartass
and El Cumpleanos de Paco, Mickey is proud to be included in the
forthcoming McSweeney's Anthology of Humor. He teaches writing at
Indiana University Southeast. He is a Leo, and quick to temper. Mickey
will read from his new book Big Wheel at the Cracker Factory. He will
ask you to purchase this book.

Graham Willoughby, the NYC act for October, has this to say about
himself: "Any New new Jersey resident who is at least 17 years old and
is not in suspension status can obtain a driver examination permit at
any MVS agency. I work in film. The exam permit is different from a
student permit because you don't have to be a student and an instructor
is not necessary. I run a comedy night called AV Club with three guys.
Note: You need a driver examination permit although you hold a valid
license from another state. I act for you. See below for details. After
you fill out the form with your legal name I write for you and present
in English proof of age, identity, think of ways to use me, name change,
if applicable, and proof that the U.S. government I like you authorizes
your presence in this country, I need you you can purchase this permit
from your local government authority use me."

Meanwhile, highlights from free handouts
people gave me at OCAP's Yorkville event:

"The corner of Avenue Rd and Cumberland is the
sight of one of the most extravagant frauds ever
to take place in Ontario. It was here that Tory MPP
Cam Jackson spent $3,000 of taxpayer money
on dinner at Mortons Steakhouse (southwest corner)
then spent $14,000 out of public funds on a room
he rented at the Four Seasons Hotel (north-east
corner) despite living only 45 minutes from Toronto
and having a government subsidized car and driver.
The Four Seasons not incidently was one of the
biggest funders of the last Tory campaign. At the
Four Seasons fine dining restaurant, Truffles, the
best bottle of wine goes for the bargain price of $3,500.
."We should also mention that those angry folks
guarding this march and feast from the Toronto
Police Service have donated the maximum
allowable donation to the party every year
since the Tories came to power."

Chant Sheet:

IT IS CLEAR WHY WE'RE HERE
YOU ARE RICH CAUSE WE ARE POOR

POVERTY - YOU CAN'T HIDE IT
WEALTH - STAND UP AND FIGHT IT

SINGLE MOTHERS UNDER ATTACK,

....and i I can only imagine, because I went home finally,
if they got to circle around Yorkville chanting these things,
and what, if anything, happened

(tho checking indimedia mainsite likely would have
pleasently informal remarks, and i will check it after
getting this loaded in to the inst.reply inbox machina

know-bodies, devoted we to under-do for you
every Sunday-day of dressy morning, black pond,
sky's germs, chairs' ponds - prove it, stain!
us, rain-free & orphaned, we're living laboratories
annnnd: ALL MY SMOKE-RINGS ARE ACCIDENTAL
the lab's insectoid emptiness is full of me -
throat, blade. - full to brimming - throat, blade.
it's like all the big stories were stitched together
into dead tiny sisters, forgive my absence's speed,
dead tiny sisters, I'm just trying to think under
your mouths' shadow erasing my bones
my smoke-ring's puncture used five drops of sweat
your footprint turned thumbprint 'round my lab door
your nails scratched the Anytime into hours
the years I have left are like tree-branches & stars:
no one will notice if a few turn up missing or
show up ahead of schedule, I was just wondering:
are explosions of lab doorsteps an accessible talent?
ruins room you, you sit on bright grass, watch for me
where the dusty break has been pushed to residue
haunted already bright we're up by a hundred X-rays
oiled in passing, in wild deceit, pushed to residue
here where the autobiographical is kept in vats
out here where your tongues are stalactites
flooded picture shore we're those stored inside for later
kept in red ragged sleeping line, now you're squashed
into a sphinx's skin weighing me upon your palm in
lieu of finer instruments, what happened to your
love of fog, my dead tiny sisters squashed in this skin?
under the lab's shadow the moonlight is in the sky
& behind the Earth's throat I'm dumb as the Sphinx
I got stones in my voices, these stones now Pyramids
& Sphinxes, annnnd: Laboratories, ... I found your
thumbprint in my mouth, full to brimming - throat, blade.

Steve Benson & Graham Foust
will read in the Discrete Series, Chicago

Friday, October 10th at 7PM
3030 W. Cortland
$5 suggested donation / BYOB

Foust will be reading from his bew book AS IN EVERY DEAFNESS
published by Flood Editions last month:
"Though As in Every Deafness recalls the wintry meditative intensity
of William Bronk, it's a new millennium: 'Our economy proceeds /
as if life were an unlearning.' Graham Foust has an unerring sense
of the exact contours of a particular thought and is able to express
them with mathematical precision and emotional delicacy; yet pushing
against lyric constraint is wildness, uneasiness, sometimes terror."
--Susan Howe

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

Constant apprehension of war has the same tendency
to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military
force with an overgrown executive will not long be safe.

"America is a quarter of a billion people totally misinformed and disinformed
by their government. This is tragic but our media is -- I wouldn't even say
corrupt -- it's just beyond telling us anything that the government doesn't

Well, nothing - in the last 15 minutes - beats getting two pre-recorded
personal calls from Bill Clinton telling me to vote No on the Recall, etc. -
but I also have some fresh stuff on the blog. As always I appreciate
comments, etc. (No, Bill did not leave me a "comment" number).

brilliant pest

well we're all tired of these. no need to reply. i know we all are.
but recycling images through the zaurus. vulnerable buildings.
some stand up proudly. some hide in the forest. at least here
not much happens.

Did I hear NPR describe the MRI discovery as one in which the technology
provided doctors with a "living image structure."??!!
Sounds like one way of looking at a poem. Or, conversely, bad poem = dead
image structure.  Etc.

>Arnold Unplugged - It's              Hasta la Vista to $9 Billion if the
>Governator is Selected                                  by Greg Palast
>
>
>It's not what Arnold Schwarzenegger did to the girls a decade
>back that should raise an eyebrow.  According to a series of
>memoranda our office obtained today, it's his dalliance with the
>boys in a hotel room just two years ago that's the real scandal.
>
>
>The wannabe governor has yet to deny that on May 17, 2001, at the
>Peninsula Hotel in Los Angeles, he had consensual political
>intercourse with Enron chieftain Kenneth Lay.  Also frolicking
>with Arnold and Ken was convicted stock swindler Mike Milken.
>
>Now, thirty-four pages of internal Enron memoranda have just come
>through this reporter's fax machine tell all about the tryst between
>Maria's husband and the corporate con men.  It turns out that
>Schwarzenegger knowingly joined the hush-hush encounter as part of a
>campaign to sabotage a Davis-Bustamante plan to make Enron and other
>power pirates then ravaging California pay back the $9 billion in
>illicit profits they carried off.
>
>Here's the story Arnold doesn't want you to hear.  The              biggest
>single threat to Ken Lay and the electricity lords is a
>private lawsuit filed last year under California's unique Civil Code
>provision 17200, the "Unfair Business Practices Act."  This
>litigation, heading to trial now in Los Angeles, would make the
>power companies return the $9 billion they filched from California
>electricity and gas customers.
>
>It takes real cojones to bring such a suit.  Who's the
>plaintiff taking on the bad guys?  Cruz Bustamante, Lieutenant
>Governor and reluctant leading candidate against Schwarzenegger.
>
>
>Now follow the action.  One month after Cruz brings suit,
>Enron's Lay calls an emergency secret meeting in L.A. of his
>political buck-buddies, including Arnold.  Their plan, to
>undercut Davis (according to Enron memos) and "solve" the energy
>crisis -- that is, make the Bustamante legal threat go away.
>
>How can that be done?  Follow the trail with me.
>
>While Bustamante's kicking Enron butt in court, the Davis
>Administration is simultaneously demanding that George Bush's energy
>regulators order the $9 billion refund.   Don't hold your
>breath:  Bush's Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is headed
>by a guy proposed by =85 Ken Lay.
>
>But Bush's boys on the commission have a problem.  The
>evidence against the electricity barons is rock solid:
>fraudulent reporting of sales transactions, megawatt "laundering,"
>fake power delivery scheduling and straight out conspiracy
>(including meetings in hotel rooms).
>
>So the Bush commissioners cook up a terrific scheme:  charge
>the companies with conspiracy but offer them, behind closed doors,
>deals in which they have to pay only two cents on each dollar they
>filched.
>
>Problem:  the slap-on-the-wrist refunds won't sail if the
>Governor of California won't play along.  Solution:               Re-call
>the Governor.
>
>New Problem:  the guy most likely to replace Davis is not              Mr.
>Musclehead, but Cruz Bustamante,  even a bigger threat to              the
>power companies than Davis.  Solution:  smear              Cruz  because --
>heaven forbid! -- he took donations from              Injuns (instead of
>Ken Lay).
>
>The pay-off?  Once Arnold is Governor, he blesses the
>sweetheart settlements with the power companies.  When that
>happens, Bustamante's court cases are probably lost.  There
>aren't many judges who will let a case go to trial to protect a
>state if that a governor has already allowed the matter to be
>"settled" by a regulatory agency.
>
>So think about this.  The state of California is in the hole
>by $8 billion for the coming year.  That's chump change next to
>the $8 TRILLION in deficits and surplus losses planned and incurred
>by George Bush.  Nevertheless, the $8 billion deficit is the
>hanging rope California's right wing is using to lynch Governor
>Davis.
>
>Yet only Davis and Bustamante are taking direct against to get
>back the $9 billion that was vacuumed out of the state by Enron,
>Reliant, Dynegy, Williams Company and the other Texas bandits who
>squeezed the state by the bulbs.
>
>But if Arnold is selected, it's 'hasta la vista' to the $9
>billion.  When the electricity emperors whistle, Arnold comes
>-- to the Peninsula Hotel or the Governor's mansion.  The
>he-man turns pussycat and curls up in their lap.
>
>I asked Mr. Muscle's PR people to comment on the new Enron memos
>-- and his strange silence on Bustamante's suit or Davis'

Do you ever think perhaps this poor mason fella
served as the model for Goya's 'The Straw Manikin'
as well. Its almost as if the two noble compadres
dropped this fella off in another picture so the ladies

If you look closely you might see
in the camouflage of Major Koch's
helmet a snake in whose mouth
occurs an explosion, also some
other little explosions nearby, and then
some other blobs which are
sort of figural and stuff,
does that mean anything to you?
Do you think maybe Abstract expressionism
was prefigured in certain 'Neo-expressionist'
characterizations of military camouflage in
Nazi Propaganda Post-cards? Don't you=20

But really, how do you support the dingle-cuff, once its deferned?
If perhaps you see some relation between world population

you have an open door policy and really thats the best way

Would anybody care to comment on this statement that was said by my wife while
coming off of anaesthesia the other morning?

"Nothing is so untrue that it doesn't have any truth in it."

It reminded me of the sayings received by the Delphic Oracle or something.  Could
anybody classify this kind of statement according to rhetoric?  It is both an
absolute statement, and it denies any kind of absolute truth, and yet it almost
insists that any statement is absolute truth, or is at least true.  Does this kind
of statement have a category?

MIME-Version: 1.0

        Scheme for a General Literature


        Wittgenstein, TLP:

        [P, E, N(E)] :
        P = all propositions
        E = any set of proportions
        N(E) = negation of E

        Russell: 'The whole symbol means whatever can be
        obtained by taking any selection of atomic
        propositions, negating them all, then taking any
        selection of the set of propositions now obtained,
        together with any of the originals--and so on
        indefinitely. This is, he [Wittgenstein] says, the
        general truth-function and also the general form of
        proposition.' (Introduction, TLP.)

        Now the negation is necessary to produce the Sheffer
        stroke and its dual; atomic propositions, however, are
        illusory - show me one.

        Nevertheless, one can write P, where
        P = generalized alphabetics; and E, where
        E = a finite subset methodology (axiom of choice)
        in any order of P. Note that P is a reasonably
        small integer < 40,000. (Of course further reduction
        is possible by virtue of binary or unary mapping.)

        We have in addition S({E}), where
        S = the substructure or ordering-site (Peirce's
        "sheet of assertion"); {E} (a set of finite subsets
        of P) is mapped onto S.

        Then clearly [P, E, S({E})] is the general form of
        literature - in particular, religious or other
        traditional or exemplary texts (including their
        diacritical and extra-alphabetic graphemes) - issues
        of practicality, decidability, etc. notwithstanding.

For Trevor Joyce's fall reading tour of Canada & the United States, The Gig
has produced a paired set of chapbooks that provide an interim showing of
his recent work.  The edition is limited to 150 copies.

            TAKE OVER
            a 51pp set of workings from the Irish and Chinese, including
            the full text of "Love Songs from a Dead Tongue"

            UNDONE, SAY
            a 46pp set of original poems, including the complete text
            of the long prose-poem "Stillsman", and "Undone", a set of
            5 texts extracted from a longer, as yet untitled project.

Both books contain much uncollected and some unpublished material, and give
a glimpse of the directions Joyce has taken since the publication of his
collected poems, _with the first dream of fire they hunt the cold_
(NWP/Shearsman, 2001; new edition forthcoming later this year). Full tables
of contents are given below, and two extracts from the books.

In Canada: $12 for the pair.  In the US: $10 US for the pair.  Overseas:
£7.50 or 10.50 euros for the pair.  All prices include airmail. Cheques are
preferred: make out to "Nate Dorward" & mail to: 109 Hounslow Ave,
Willowdale, ON, M2N 2B1, Canada (email: ndorward@sprint.ca).

ALSO NOTE: Trevor Joyce is reading in Toronto alongside Steve McCaffery &
Lise Downe, on Oct 26th, 3:00pm, at New Works Studio, 319 Spadina, 2nd
floor. Other readings are in Buffalo (Oct 29); Oxford, Ohio (Oct 30), Los
Angeles (Nov 4 & 12), San Diego (Nov 5 & 6) & San Francisco (Nov 13):
backchannel me if you want more details.

Speaking of What Has Happened

Undone:
    "fire in the wood"
    1. "This hot, utterly jubilant baker"

From TAKE OVER:

Dánta Grádha 18
(Worked from the Irish)

She is my love
   was most my misery
preferred for wasting me
   to her could cure

She is my fair
   would fast enfeeble me
not whisper for my going oh!
   or mind my grave

She is my dear
   nature's accessory
wouldn't reach a hand to hold my head
   lay me for gold

She is my why
   drops not a hint to me
heeds no true word
   spares no regard

Great is my grief
   too long this lingering
who most suspects me
   is all my love


From UNDONE, SAY:

Speaking of What Has Happened

always some huge unseen
alters in the world
between each flicker and the next

consequent apprehension comes
not like an autopsy
whose subject should be dead

but through divisions
of the living breath
that is one whole

from first cry to the end
though it accelerates or slows
by turn grows clear

or close or dull or fine
mastering like a weather
the exposed attention

shivering after makes report
it rained was sunny for a while
then came a storm

Call For Abstracts

The Undead and Philosophy

Richard Greene & K. Silem Mohammad, Editors

Abstracts are sought for a collection of philosophical essays on the theme
of the undead.  The editors are currently in discussion with Open Court
Press (The publisher of _The Simpsons and Philosophy_, _The Matrix and
Philosophy_, and the forthcoming _The Sopranos and Philosophy_, etc.)
regarding the inclusion of this collection in a new book series dealing wit=
h
philosophy and various cultural topics.  We are seeking abstracts, but
anyone who has already written an unpublished paper on this topic may submi=
t
it in its entirety.  Potential contributors may want to examine other
volumes in the Open Court series.

Contributors are welcome to submit abstracts on any topic of philosophical

Subject: TAKE OVER / UNDONE, SAY: two new books by Trevor Joyce

*

For Trevor Joyce's fall reading tour of Canada & the United States, The
Gig
has produced a paired set of chapbooks that provide an interim showing
of
his recent work.  The edition is limited to 150 copies.

            TAKE OVER
            a 51pp set of workings from the Irish and Chinese, including
            the full text of "Love Songs from a Dead Tongue"

            UNDONE, SAY
            a 46pp set of original poems, including the complete text
            of the long prose-poem "Stillsman", and "Undone", a set of
            5 texts extracted from a longer, as yet untitled project.

Both books contain much uncollected and some unpublished material, and
give
a glimpse of the directions Joyce has taken since the publication of his
collected poems, _with the first dream of fire they hunt the cold_
(NWP/Shearsman, 2001; new edition forthcoming later this year). Full
tables
of contents are given below, and two extracts from the books.

In Canada: $12 for the pair.  In the US: $10 US for the pair.  Overseas:
=A37.50 or 10.50 euros for the pair.  All prices include airmail. =
Cheques
are
preferred: make out to "Nate Dorward" & mail to: 109 Hounslow Ave,
Willowdale, ON, M2N 2B1, Canada (email: ndorward@sprint.ca).

ALSO NOTE: Trevor Joyce is reading in Toronto alongside Steve McCaffery
&
Lise Downe, on Oct 26th, 3:00pm, at New Works Studio, 319 Spadina, 2nd
floor. Other readings are in Buffalo (Oct 29); Oxford, Ohio (Oct 30),

Speaking of What Has Happened

Undone:

>From TAKE OVER:

D=E1nta Gr=E1dha 18
(Worked from the Irish)

She is my love
   was most my misery
preferred for wasting me
   to her could cure

She is my fair
   would fast enfeeble me
not whisper for my going oh!
   or mind my grave

She is my dear
   nature's accessory
wouldn't reach a hand to hold my head
   lay me for gold

She is my why
   drops not a hint to me
heeds no true word
   spares no regard

Great is my grief
   too long this lingering
who most suspects me
   is all my love


>From UNDONE, SAY:

Speaking of What Has Happened

always some huge unseen
alters in the world
between each flicker and the next

consequent apprehension comes
not like an autopsy
whose subject should be dead

but through divisions
of the living breath
that is one whole

from first cry to the end
though it accelerates or slows
by turn grows clear

or close or dull or fine
mastering like a weather
the exposed attention

shivering after makes report
it rained was sunny for a while
then came a storm

there other distinctions to be made?)
• To explore the gray areas around the prose poem, especially in work that
exists on the boundary between the prose poem and free verse on one hand and
the prose poem and the essay on the other
• To publish work that extends our conceptions of what the “prose poem” is
or can be

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Subject: A.Word.A.Day--octothorpe

octothorpe (OK-tuh-thorp) noun

   The symbol #.

[The symbol # is derived from a shorthand way of writing lb, the abbreviation
for the Latin libra (balance), just as $ is a shorthand way of writing US.
Octothorpe is an alteration, influenced by octo-, of earlier octalthorpe,
probably a humorous blend of octal (an eight-point pin used in electronic
connections) and someone whose last name was or ended in "thorpe", and whose
identity is subject to speculation. It may be James Edward Oglethorpe, an
eighteenth century English philanthropist, but more likely it is an Olympic
athlete, Jim Thorpe. In the early 1960s, Bell Labs introduced two special
keys in its innovative touch-tone telephone keypads, "#" and "*", for which
it needed fresh names. Having eight points, "octo-" was an obvious first
element. Since the engineer involved in introducing this innovation was
active in a group seeking the return of Jim Thorpe's medals from Sweden, he
whimsically added "-thorpe", creating octothorpe. (Jim Thorpe was
disqualified because of his professional status, but his medals were
restored posthumously.) The "#" is also known as a pound sign, crosshatch,
number sign, sharp, hash, crunch, mesh, hex, flash, grid, pig-pen, gate,
hak, oof, rake, fence, gate, grid, gridlet, square, and widget mark.]

Some other eight-based words, other than the obvious octagon, octave, and
octopus, are octamerous, having eight parts or organs; octane, a type of
hydrocarbon in fuel and solvents; octant, the eighth part of a circle;
octonare and octapody, a verse of eight feet; and octonary, pertaining to
the number eight.

  "In Boise, Idaho, US West is testing a system it calls Voice Interactive
   Phone, or VIP. By dialing the octothorpe (#) and 44, then saying
   'Messages,' a subscriber can retrieve voice mail."
   Gene Bylinsky and Alicia Hills Moore; Fortune (New York); At Last!
   Computers You Can Talk to; May 3, 1993.

For those who are in New York this Saturday, the 11th, Anne Tardos and I =
will be doing a reading and performance from the poetry of Schwitters and=
 Picasso as the opener in Caroline Crumpacker=92s Bilingual Poetry Series=
 at the Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, just north of Houston.

The reading will feature translations from two Exact Change titles edited=
 and largely translated by Pierre Joris and myself =96 Schwitters=92 PPPP=
PP (Poems Performance Pieces Proses Plays Poetics) and Picasso=92s The Bu=
rial of the Count of Orgaz, and Other Poems (scheduled for publication in=
 May).  Both Schwitters and Picasso are well enough known as artists, but=
 their experimental,  transgressive and prolific poetry may come (as it d=
id for us) as something of a revelation.  The reading will include record=
ings by Schwitters of a section of his Ur Sonata (long in circulation) an=
d his pastiche or parody of romantic/expressionist poetry =93For Anna Blu=
me=94 in both German and English.

The reading is scheduled to begin at 6:00 and will fitingly follow the Se=
gue event, "In Others' Words: Parody & Pastiche," scheduled for 4:00 p.m.=

Call for Work for Chain 11

As long as art is the beauty parlor of civilization, neither art nor
civilization is secure.
--John Dewey, Art as Experience

Nobody knows who the public is or what it wants or needs.
--David Antin

If you are a reader of Chain, we would be pleased to read your work for
Chain 11: PUBLIC FORMS. We are interested in pieces that address what is
commonly called public art--visual artworks that are publicly displayed
and frequently supported by public funds--but also various forms of art
that happen outside of usual performance and publication contexts such
as street art, political speeches, poster campaigns, architectural
design, mail art, community theater, speaker's corners, poetry written
for specific public occasions, etc. In other words, this issue will
investigate art that is created for communities or "the public" in its
broader definitions.

We also encourage a variety of "reports from the field," where artists
observe how public art functions in their local environments. Such
reports could take any genre or form, visual or textual. Reports from
outside the United States are especially welcome.

Please be aware that we can only print visual images in black and white.

Send two copies of your submission and two copies of your cover letter to
CHAIN (c/o Jena Osman)
English Department
Temple University
Anderson Hall (022-29)
1114 W. Berks St.
Philadelphia, PA 19122-6090.

Deadline: December 1, 2003

If you have questions, send them to josman@temple.edu and
spahr@hawaii.edu. But please, NO email submissions (we tend to lose them).

Enclose a self-addressed, stamped envelope if you would like your work
returned. Do not send us originals.

We read work in December and then contact everyone in early February at
the latest.

GENERAL GUIDELINES: Please look at past issues of Chain to see the sort
of work we tend to publish. We welcome submissions from writers and
artists who we do not know, who have never published before, who write
in languages other than English, who write in unusual forms, etc. We
enjoy reading new work. But we only accept work that somehow comments on
the topic of each issue. If this is likely to not be obvious to us, then
you might want to explain how it engages the topic.

If you find our journal interesting enough for you to entrust your work
to it, we encourage you to subscribe. Our continued existence, and
continued ability to read your work, depends mainly on subscriptions.

We tend to privilege mixed media and collaborative work.

We can accept work submitted on floppy disks, zip disks, and cd-rom but
we need to see a paper copy with your submission.

We do not accept submissions by email (we tend to lose them when this
happens).

We only print work that is black and white.

Our page size is 6"x9" with 1" inside margin and 3/4" outside margins.
If you design work for our page and require specific fonts, you must
supply pagemaker files with postcript fonts.

I do not know the rhetorical name for this.
It reminds one of Pascal's "Wager"--

are true yet not truth itself"--

Hi,

If anyone has Rosemarie Waldrop's email address and if
you think she wouldn't mind, could you please send it
to me backchannel? I'm interested in asking some
questions about Jabes. Thanks very much.

Best,

On the corner of 52nd Avenue and Powell Boulevard,
a unit of the extant Umwelt once again explored the beautiful,=20
if unsettling, notion of applying the lexicographical shellability
technique to N literary systems of interlinking metaphors (po[em]sets).
First, the unit compiled a metacognitive automorphism on the
notional intersections of a complex subspace arrangement
of N(lit.sys){Int.Met.} and produced the discrete mnemonic
spanning tree fragment: The problem of N bodies on the surface of=20
the sphere interacting by a logarithmic potential is examined for =
selected=20
N ranging from 4 to 40,962,comparing the energies found by placing=20
points at the vertices of certain polyhedrons to the lowest energies=20
found by a Monte Carlo algorithm. The Unit found that delimiting the=20
contextual specificity of the fragment it once again produced the =
spectre=20
of N(lit.sys){Int.Met.} which could invariably, or rather, covariably,=20
produce an array of (po[em]sets). Privately, the Unit 'determined' that=20
using the example of Boole's metaphor, which links arithmetic operations =

to "class" (set theoretic) operations, a range of lexicographically =
shellable=20
automorphic recursions could be performed as a set of interlinking=20
metaphors which undermined the categorical stability of socially=20
defined data-sets, and thus by simplicial inclusion, (po[em]sets).=20
The Unit also found that by constructing a hierarchy of increasingly=20
coarse complexes that decompose a piecewise linear 2-manifold=20
it could reconfigure its own metacognition as an expression of=20
historical sampling not merely defined by the intersections of a=20
complex subspace arrangement, but could redefine, by the use of=20
certain projections of binary linear codes onto larger fields, a hybrid=20
spanning tree which incorporated a covariant of all extant (po[em]sets)=20
within N(lit.sys){Int.Met.}. This is assuming of course that one =
understands
the Basic Metaphor of Infinity (BMI), which allows one to deal with=20
infinite sets, points at infinity, limits of infinite series, infinite =
intersections=20
and least upper bounds. These are hypothesized as "special cases=20
of a single general conceptual metaphor in which processes that go=20
on indefinitely are conceptualized as having an end and an=20
ultimate result." This allowed the Unit to further surmise that these=20
(po[em]sets) might also reflect the other various manifestations of the=20
BMI: limits and continuity, transfinite arithmetic, and infinitesimals, =
as well=20
as metaphors attributed to Richard Dedekind and Karl Weierstrass.=20
Just then two automobiles collided at the intersection it should
have been crossing. The Automorphism it had been compiling
had just saved its life. The Unit resumed its metacognition parable,
but immediately related to itself, this section of iteration would
be titled: Extension N-1. The operand is saved but the equation
exists as a finitude, though its gesture can be said to occur=20
transinfinitely. The Unit posed an enigmatic homomorphism to itself
to end the compilation segment, just a single lexical object: matroid.
"Just a fender bender," the Unit thought and crossed the intersection.=20

removal of the gods of Troy. Cabin, fit to entertain a travelling god, and
where a goddess might if this traveling demigod, this cloud-compeller,
would ere long take were more favored by the gods than they, beyond any
deserts that I restoring gods and men to the vigor of youth.  She was
probably demigods to him. If you told him that such a one was coming, who,
"loudly singing the praises of the gods to his lyre, drowned him; who goes
to market for his god as it is; on whose farm nothing of spruce trees, and
toadstools, round tables of the swamp gods, cover hemlock more than usual,
standing like a pagoda in the midst of the gods must be proud, thought I,
with such forked flashes to rout a fear that we are such gods or demigods
only as fauns and satyrs, the god he worships, after a style purely his
own, nor can he get off by the god of loons to aid him, and immediately
there came a wind from one who answered, and his god was angry with me;
and so I left him me. I sacrificed it to Vulcan, for it was past serving
the god conlucare, that is, would believe that it is sacred to some god.
The Roman made an expiatory offering, and prayed, Whatever god or goddess
thou art to whom this grove is sacred, be propitious to me,

           and ask the gods to pardon this clear flame ...

 Years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our God in,
they will do; will they not?  Who ever saw his old clothes ...

    "As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any Thank
God, I can sit and I can stand without the aid of a furniture God, is his
private ail." Let this be righted, let the spring come saints. Our hymn-
books resound with a melodious cursing of God and satisfaction with the
gift of life, any memorable praise of God. Trees which the Most High God
has created lofty and umbrageous, they have uncertainty about it, whether
it is of the devil or of God and "glorify God and enjoy him forever" here.
God himself culminates in the present moment, and will never sometimes
appear to be two, but one is a mock sun.  God is alone -- keeping it -
ministers who spoke of God as if they enjoyed a monopoly ...

              I cannot come nearer to God and Heaven and the engine's
soot. One proposes that it be called "God's Drop." which God forbid, it
can be made to flow thither again. If by never spoke a good word for it,
nor thanked God that He had made it. who would carry his God, to market,
if he could get anything in the mind's approximation to God. Yet one
spirits various fruits which succeed him. Man flows at once to God when
there was a Buttrick ... "Fire! for God's sake fire!" -- And thousands of
these he peddles still, prompting God and disgracing man, and faith making
plain the image engraven in men's bodies, the God which God gives them,
nor accept the pardon which he freely offers ...

    I have more of God, they more of the road, your clothes and keep your
thoughts. God will see that you do not hourly expect a speech from
somebody. God is only the president of help you God, and so only. Every
nail driven should be as another ...

Americans beginning to suffer a post-Iraq hangover

The Kingston Whig-Standard
Oct 6, 2003
Gwynne Dyer

Lying in bed just after 7 a.m., listening to the radio. The rain is
pouring down, my youngest child has decided that she'd rather be driven
to school today and the BBC's Today program, which completely dominates
serious morning radio news, is discussing the closing day of the Labour
Party conference.

It was the Today program, a few months ago, that reported that the
British government had "sexed up" last year's dossier on Saddam Hussein's
alleged weapons of mass destruction, setting in motion a train of events
that led to a senior official's suicide, the Hutton inquiry and huge
damage to Prime Minister Tony Blair's reputation. Blair has just made a
speech to the conference defending his motives in attacking Iraq
alongside the United States and asking the delegates for understanding.
Most of them heartily disapprove of the war, but they give him a standing
ovation nevertheless. So how do the presenters deal with the gap between
the public displays of unity and the seething dissent beneath the
surface?

They do it by talking about the decision to bring back the practice of
singing The Red Flag at the end of the conference. The old socialist
anthem was dropped in the 1980s, when Labour realized that luring
middle-class voters was not fully compatible with songs about class war
('The People's flag is deepest red / It shrouded oft our martyred dead"),
but now that Blair has led the party into the sunlit capitalist uplands
of privatization and foreign invasions, the problem is how to keep the
old left-wing stalwarts from rebelling. A little socialist
window-dressing helps.

So the Today program had some fun with that, and then offered helpful
hints about less-antiquated songs that might capture the essence of the
proceedings. How about something that said what was really on the
delegates' minds? Cue the Vietnam-era song "War! Unh! What is it good
for? Absolutely nothing!" Or maybe something from the British rock group
the Animals to sum up Tony Blair's state of mind? "I'm just a soul whose
intentions are good. / Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood."
Then on to the next item of news.

And it struck me (still lying there) that no serious American radio or
television broadcaster would ever joke about a U.S. major political party
convention like that. The U.S. news media generally treat political
figures with the utmost reverence, no matter how few clothes the emperor
in question may be wearing on a given day. Which leads to further
thoughts about the nature of the political process in the United States.

A couple of weeks ago I was at a professional conference of several
hundred American newspaper journalists, and to my astonishment the
opening session was devoted to three history professors who gave talks on
the "Founding Fathers" (Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, et al.) and
their relevance for Americans today. Good talks, actually, but can you
imagine a couple of hundred British or Australian journalists - or
Russian or Indian ones - voluntarily sitting through an hour's discussion
of 18th-century history at their professional convention? It would never
happen.

Americans are brought up to think of their country as "new" and Europe
and Asia as "old," but there are few nations in Eurasia where the
constitutional arrangements are even one century old. Most countries go
back no further than 1945 in their current political incarnation -
whereas the United States has had the same constitution and political
system for two-and-a-quarter centuries. It has also been largely spared
the calamitous wars that smashed the old structures and the mindset that
went with them in every other great power during the 20th century.

It goes directly counter to the prevailing domestic ideology to say this,
and it frequently infuriates Americans who mistake it for criticism, but
the United States is a very old-fashioned country compared to the other
industrialized democracies. This is visible in the overt nationalism and
religiosity of public debate, in the huge role that lawyers and
litigation play in a society based on a 200-year-old constitution and in
the reverence Americans have for their ancient political institutions. It
makes for a society that is instinctively conservative in both social and
political matters (apart from a few big cities on the coasts).
This does mean that Americans are significantly slower to change their
minds on major issues than the febrile French and the volatile Germans -
let alone the flibbertigibbet British - but they do generally get there
in the end, and it is generally the same "there." At the moment, the
post-Iraq collapse of public trust in the government in Britain is about
three months ahead of the parallel process in the United States, but
Americans are catching up fast.

Rob Swift vs the Blend
(a meditation on a “the Blend” number two and Rob Swift’s “Ablist”)
by
Lawrence Ytzhak Braithwaite (aka Lord Patch)
Fernwood/The Hood/New Palestine 1424...



What’s the definition of this essay:

...allow me to demonstrate...

...a journey in my mental...carvan from Ditch to Legends, contemplating
bass domination, of George Scott 3rd, as he leads contortions of riddim,
like a graffer works a rhyme on wallz via tips and nozzles, like an
illustrator transforms word to image, like writers collects the syntax
of sight into the symbolism of lexis, like cymbals and kneck snapping
snares used by a selector Swift at the controls on this journey ? this
is how I was travelling while contemplating flow. This thought is
immediate. The elements of art and foreign flava in sonic epistle as a
soundtrack in desidant/miltant Victorians tearing errors artistically to
make the set go boom; it moves the sight/seen mise en byme toons steppin
to be heard in this city to prove and show it’s post modem cut and paste
flex.  Turntablist to carTUNIST  -- skillz tight like Panochio/an idiot
gonna solo/paint a village thick like bass so low = all city audio
addict thematic. Comics about comics vs Turntablist enabling
turntablists on cds. “What would you do if a viscous enemy suddenly
started comin at you armed to the teeth and ready to kill you? ...”a
little hard to ignore. (indeed) “There must be something unpalatable
about the comics to the female of the species.:.  “I rented ‘Ghost Dog:
Way of the Samurai’ last night. Have you seen it? Don’t you think it
would make a good graphic novel?” S’all dope on plastics and paper; from
the flex of a wrist -- the pressure point of the pen on the paper to
the/to the/and to the... scratch of the ink and the contours of grooves
ground down on vinyl = “all my competitors get chopped up”.

How many panels per page? ...
How many beats per minute? ...
How fast does light travel? 186,000 miles per second/299,792,458 metres
per second
How fast does sound travel? 1129 feet per seccond/344 metres per second
This is our day
This is
Our
 is
        Our      ...day

This essay:

...a try and attempt at a skill, nah fail, luring from one acoustic
space to the space btwn panels sincing details of signifiers into
samples of sounds to bites from life like “waiting on the corner” in
Victoria “with a pizza in one hand and campy horror movies in the
other’. Choppin from track to audio narrative to make “the panel of each
and every comic book a (...) statement” = “this is our day”.  What’s’
the definition of this kite on the tight light and shaded writs of Blend
and the crack choppin headshells of Rob Swift?  “teenage boys”? “I can
remember just about every writer or artist that I’ve enjoyed since I was
a kid”; the motivation of surreality in the unreality of reality what is
the fluidity of the complexity of the audio comic panel soundtrack about
heads (hedz?) and lives in undisputable art for the knots come mental
bangers. Macluhan, Mclaren born from Tzara -- “all my competitors get
chopped up”.

S’all la!!!

...manga/daDA of  sound set to soul... the Gyson collection of theory
into practical boppin rubber end sole come the unanimated waitng for a
referent to send messages out to phat cuts.  ...on boards, card or
controlled, with levers... It’s the intellectual alienation of Ghost
Dog’s urban dumbshow set to glued mats measured mathematically ? my
themes and tactics set to blend this semiotics to sonic.  Brain Wilson’s
Lee/Tubby and King Perry’s echo chamber of versions plastered on paper
as the subtitled parchments of PacNW Victorian ins steppin up with
Jinnutiy in possessions; “with a pizza in one hand and campy horror
movies in the other’ -- inspiration/depression/madness petting sounds
and holding tight to egos = Neckbeard upsets Clay George like the
Upsetter and sends Portishead on run for their metre.  1 is alwys born
from a cypher.

The Ablist vs the illustrator and essayist = A swift ambient to the
recorded tales of Brassard, gignaC AND desrosiers blend to manipulating

Here's a reminder invite to an art and poetry exhibit.

Yuko Otomo is a wonderful artist and this is her first solo show.  It
includes a collaboration we've done--12 pieces she created based on 12
excerpts from my Journal of Emotional Sensation.  She's displaying the
text next to the artwork like the leaves of a book.

We may be reading in the space together (since she's also a poet) a
little later in the run of the show.  But it would be lovely to have you
join us at the opening for a glass of wine or two.

Reception:  Friday, Oct. 10, 6-9pm
Show runs through Oct. 26, 2003

this has to be someone's idea of a joke, right? and even so, a rather racist

it's posts like this that could have the list being monitored again.

I woke up yesterday morning morning to Arnold
delivering his victory speech on the radio. His
inflections, his accent, his speaking style, tempered
by current political climate, chilled.

If I never heard that word "raghead" again--

But why must I say this here to the reasonably well
educated--or to my students--or to friends of friends
who found the bombing of Baghdad "humane" because the
Americans were specifically not targeting hospitals,
electrical grid, etc.

As last time.

Is it selfish to feel like not "working." Like when I
decided I would certainly not respond to his e-mail
because the writer excused himself by explaining how
he "hates" Bush and "loves" Arabs.

Why "hate" anyone? Anything.

It makes me mostly feel tired.

Amina Lawal acquitted. Thank God. Because of cases
like that people on this list talking about the
"malady" in the Islamic world. Only months after we
(joyfully) embraced said world's poetic forms in
flurry of ghazals.

But I'm not anyone. Really.

Why do we have to react against everything with ANGER?
Why "hate" Bush? Why scream slogans? Or raise the fist
in the air? Why do we have to use all the tools of war
in service of peace?

Why to make "ironic" e-mails that use the words "fuck"
and "raghead"?

Damage of creating unsafe space, whether intentional
or not, is done.

We can only hope to act in generosity, in love for
each other, with charitable intentions.

Subject: why irony

I woke up yesterday morning morning to Arnold
delivering his victory speech on the radio. His
inflections, his accent, his speaking style, tempered
by current political climate, chilled.

If I never heard that word "raghead" again--

But why must I say this here to the reasonably well
educated--or to my students--or to friends of friends
who found the bombing of Baghdad "humane" because the
Americans were specifically not targeting hospitals,
electrical grid, etc.

As last time.

Is it selfish to feel like not "working." Like when I
decided I would certainly not respond to his e-mail
because the writer excused himself by explaining how
he "hates" Bush and "loves" Arabs.

Why "hate" anyone? Anything.

It makes me mostly feel tired.

Amina Lawal acquitted. Thank God. Because of cases
like that people on this list talking about the
"malady" in the Islamic world. Only months after we
(joyfully) embraced said world's poetic forms in
flurry of ghazals.

But I'm not anyone. Really.

Why do we have to react against everything with ANGER?
Why "hate" Bush? Why scream slogans? Or raise the fist
in the air? Why do we have to use all the tools of war
in service of peace?

Why to make "ironic" e-mails that use the words "fuck"
and "raghead"?

Damage of creating unsafe space, whether intentional
or not, is done.

We can only hope to act in generosity, in love for
each other, with charitable intentions.

but pertend it is this way...

to speak clear enough to get board, truly bored,  the wrong body blown
to bits creeping along the flesh board, and not just killed, but an
extra soul with milage,  traveling in true time along on the ocean's
genderdysleixc bed; or just sexuality blind for a moment to the point
of pleasure merging normal with a point near zero; just off the
horizon, still on the screen; thick in the sound of dropping dead
ladders, ladders to the right and to left, thousands of dead ladders
with no placed to go but fall; what could be done? crossdress or find
someone who will surgically pretend any thing you want, use
multi-voices from an unheard crevasses across the continent to your
door, hire personal floor advisers to wish upon a star, dead or alive;
together, one's own blood to the next; a billion billion billion light
years from there you are, neither this way or, chemical enhanced, or
chemical enhanced and away from this and neither; just bored, more
board than an entire life could suspend, neither montana gandhi or
christ on hormones jorgensen could tie a knot around this, just azure
as azure as blush almost rhapsody, a talcum power tale vibrating vacuum
stick, yet business as normal, bored; an apparatus contained in a
single housing written in proper grammar / english / legalese; in the
manner of the copy of the orginal lattice work in marble, from a
forgotten pause nearly lost then found then lost then paradise and then
bored; five thousand square miles always on sale, delivered to any
door, a clitoris or a phallus in neon working order, with the chance to
be the other with an oath never to tell everyone that knows, nature
made a mistake, or didn't, which has been corrected or not,any thing to
be turly bored.

On Lynn Crawford: In his review of Simply Separate People, Brian Evenson=20
notes Crawford=92s humor, legible even in the odd names of her characters=20
(=93Physh,=94 =93Pumper,=94 =93Seamstress,=94 and =93Trowt") as well as=
 =93ability to=20
integrate the outlandish with a complex narrative structure in such a way=20
as to create a work that appeals both on the level of story and=20
aesthetically.=94 Harry Mathews claims for her novel a world =93so=
 bewitching=20
and original she soon may find the Surgeon General classifying her work as=
=20
dangerously addictive.=94 The intense visuality in Crawford=92s writing is a=
=20
compelling carry-over from her work as a critic of contemporary art. Her=20
writings have appeared in anthologies such as The Oulipo Compendium (Atlas=
=20
Press) and Fetish Fiction (Four Walls Eight Windows), and she has published=
=20
criticism on art and literature in Art in America, Bookforum, American=20
Ceramics, and the Detroit Metro Times. She is currently literary editor of=
=20
the on-line journal thedetroiter.com.

On Gail Scott: In a bathtub, =93a woman negotiates a significant political=
=20
and personal passage from Quebec=92s 70s to the 80s=94 (Heroine). In a=
 Montreal=20
caf=E9 in the 90s, another woman considers that it is not a crime =93to make=
 up=20
portraits of patrons in a bar=94 (Main Brides) against a backdrop of ghostly=
=20
urban violence. The millennium takes Scott=92s readers to the Paris of My=20
Paris, where the  narrator keeps =93a diary of auto-ethnographic=
 projections=94=20
that critic Diane Chisholm identifies as =93feminist anger,=94 =93hedonistic=
=20
desire,=94 and a critique of postmodern capitalism. Each of Scott=92s  works=
=20
are =93a personal act of subversion and creation=94 taking us outside =93the=
=20
ordinary circuits of thought.=94 My Paris, named one of the ten best novels=
=20
of 1999 by Canada=92s trade magazine Quill & Quire, was just released in an=
=20
American edition from Dalkey Archive. Scott=92s other novels include Heroine=
=20
and Main Brides (Coach House). Her translation of Michael Delisle=92s Le=20
Desarroi du matelot (The Sailor=92s Disquiet) was shortlisted for the=20
Governor General=92s award in 2001. Scott is also the author of a collection=
=20
of short stories, Spare Parts (Coach House) and a collection of essays,=20
Spaces Like Stairs (Women=92s Press).

On Steve Benson: Benson=92s writing =93bristles with an exuberant=
 improvisatory=20
energy, telegraphically connecting linguistic probes and self-directed=20
cross-examination,=94 writes Charles Bernstein. His poetry is =93the medium=
=94=20
through which =93scrape and reverberation,=94 =93interpersonal interaction,=
=94=20
=93interference patterns,=94 and =93weightless crushes=94 have been=
 successfully=20
=93sanctioned and effected.=94 His compositional tactics are performances in=
=20
themselves, and a poetry performance by Steve Benson is always playful and=
=20
surprising. Benson has performed throughout the United States and in=20
England. His books include Blindspots (Whalecloth), Blue Book (The=20
Figures), Reverse Order (Potes and Poets) and Rolling Rock (Zasterle=20
Press). Identified with the West Coast Language School from its beginning,=
=20
Benson currently lives in Maine where he practices psychotherapy. For a=20
compelling discussion of Benson=92s taped-voice performances, see Michael=20
Davidson=92s =93Technologies of Presence=94 in Ghostlier Demarcations=
 (California).

On Bob Perelman: A =93witty analyst of the language writing movement,=94 and=
=20
Professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania,  Bob Perelman is=20
above all a consummate political and social satirist, =93putting his own=20
version of socio-poetic English on the air,=94 as =93scary as it is funny.=
=94 =93We=20
may not have chosen to live inside Dick Cheney=92s mind, but we do. /=20
Wyoming, I read somewhere, is the safest place to live in North America. /=
=20
How do you get from Wyoming to Shock and Awe?=94 writes Perelman in his=20
widely circulated anti-war poem, =93Where We Are.=94 Perelman is author of=
=20
thirteen books of poetry, including a selected poems, One to Ten=20
(Wesleyan), The Future of Memory (Roof Books), Seven Works (The Figures),=20
and Primer (This). His most recent work, Playing Bodies (Granary Press) is=
=20
a collaboration with the artist Francie Shaw. His critical writings include=

no sources, but a thought: it seems to me that the porousness, the
tabula rasa openness of "negative capability" is less like chastity
and more like potential promiscuity. i at least think of the cult of
virginity being rigid, part of a system of virtue/evil, that vitiates
whatever po(e)tential could be attributed to the "negative space" of
the virgin birth canal protected by the hymen.  some concept of
fluidity, of permeability, seems more akin to "negative capability"
to me.  but i don't know what the romantics thought, except that
shelley believed in open marriage.

Laird Hunt will be giving two readings in the Bay Area of his new book,
Indiana, Indiana (the dark and lovely portions of the night).

October 13
Moe's Books (with Robert Gluck)
Berkeley, CA

October 14
City Lights
San Francisco, CA

This is a beautiful novel that poets should read too. Hunt's writing is
thoughtful and, well, dark & lovely actually describes it. There's a
texture to his prose, like Ondaatje's, that perhaps stems from his
knowledge of poetry, perhaps stems from him just being a truly good
writer. I highly recommend the book, and his reading from it.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

The Diaspora Poetics series has been going strong for over a year now . . .
and I think our programming has just gotten better.  This week, Amarnath
Ravva & Jaime Cortez share the stage.

Jaime Cortez and Amarnath Ravva

Monday, October 13, 8 pm
New Langton Arts, San Francisco
1246 Folsom St

An artist and writer based in San Francisco, Jaime Cortez is editor of the
queer Latino anthology Virgins Guerrillas & Locas and has been anthologized
in numerous collections including 2Sexe, Besame Mucho, and Queer Papi Porn.
For Diaspora Poetics he reads from The Burning Bush, a collection of stories
about his street/sex life. Amarnath Ravva is a Los Angeles-based poet and
video artist whose work has appeared in Interlope, Nocturnes, and Berkeley
Poetry Review. For Langton Ravva reads a selection of new prose poems
addressing a cultural apprehension of his origins and will show a short
video piece titled 1977.

Diaspora Poetics brings together writers from diverse cultural backgrounds,
and presents experimental writing that addresses the notion of diaspora and
the resulting cultural outpouring by poets and writers who are placed,
pushed, or choose to situate themselves at the margins of society.

Diaspora Poetics receives special funding from the Zellerbach Family Fund.
Tickets $6/$4 members, students, seniors
Box Office Hours Tuesday - Saturday 12-6 pm And 1 hour before performances

Good Friday,

I was hoping that someone would know of a decent on-line edition of Un
Coup de Des. English or french, it doesn't matter. I know of the one on
UBU but I don't think that one is very successful. I remember coming across a
good  one that I believe was pdf but I have no idea where I saw it. Has
anyone ever tried ot do it as flash animation? Playing on the
constellation effect/affect.

lastly, has anyone heard tell of this:

1977
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toute revolution est un coup de des (Every Revolution ls a Throw
of the Dice)
11 minutes
Photography: William Lubtchansky
 (35 mm, Eastmancolor)
Sound: Louis Hochet
Actors: Daniele Huillet, Marilu Parolini, Dominique Villain, Andrea
 Spingler, Helmut Farber, Michel Delahaye, Manfred Blank,

Based on the poem A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance
 by Stephane Mallarme
Filmed on location in the Pere Lachaise Cemetery, Paris, May 1977

Kazim,

As painful as it is, the Malady of Islam is a book written by an Islamic
author from Tunisia.  I am sometimes afraid that to look the other way and
pretend all's right is equally a crime as looking and saying that there is a
problem.  I'm not saying that Bush can fix it.  There is a weird feeling I
have gotten over the last thirty years that many poets think the police
should be disbanded and we can all get along.  Peace is not something that
you can just have.  There's an exterior world, even if Lacan would have it
otherwise.

Even the Dalai Lama recognizes this, although he too doesn't want police or
an army in his country.  And so he's living in exile, and his people are
being slaughtered.

I don't hate anybody, but I prefer the hedgehog to the ostrich.

War and peace are interrelated.

miekal, my best short answer to what i think you're asking me:

http://ratchetup.typepad.com/daf

(scroll down to my head)

my talk ("three movements in search of a medium") is a talk, finally,
and will try to work some different formal-generic constraints, so as
to effect the more affective aspects of digitality... or something
like that!... but i'm sure to wax autobiographical in part, as i just
can't seem to get out of my own way...

best,

You must never try.
It is very important to understand the difference.
It is not complicated.
The address is like a machine.
The address is like a voice.
If you make a mistake you will quickly realize it.
No harm will have been done.
No harm will ever be done.
People get mad. It works.
Thousands of people expect a lot.
People get upset if you issue commands.
If you  do not trust the system, after a while you may find this annoying.
Mail will look different.
You will know immediately that this is an acknowledgement.
You should not publicly GIVE.
Finally, you can turn completely.
Finally, you can turn.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

Constant apprehension of war has the same tendency
to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military
force with an overgrown executive will not long be safe.
companions to liberty.  -- Thomas Jefferson


"America is a quarter of a billion people totally misinformed and disinformed
by their government. This is tragic but our media is -- I wouldn't even say
corrupt -- it's just beyond telling us anything that the government doesn't
want us to know."

Gore Vidal

I saw this film.  It is a one-shot continuous reading of the poem shot below the
wall at Pere Lachaise cemetery, against the wall where many members of the commune
were shot.  It's been twenty years since I've seen the film, but I think that that
was the significance of it being shot in the cemetery against the wall there.  As
the film ends, the camera goes over the wall to reveal modern Paris.  there is no
commentary.  I thought the film was striking, and I still remember it very
vividly..  Deleuze uses that line of the throw of the dice and says that any life
worth having is a throw of the dice.  This is in his book on Nietzsche.  -- Kirby

I thought of a multiculturally acceptable image for the intertwining of war
and peace: yin and yang!

I think that one of the things that is not well understood in the west
concerning the Islamic jihad can be seen in the Bin Laden poem.  It's the
concept of honor.  We don't have that idea very strongly any longer except
perhaps in certain places in the southern states where I encountered it
occasionally.  Even the idea of killing women who have been raped, or having
nothing to do with them which struck most people in the west as gruesome in
the Bosnia footage has something to do with this very complex system of
honor.  Honor is somehow more important than possessions, or any other
thing.  I don't really understand this, but I think this is part of what Bin
Laden is fighting for, based on the poem that appeared in this list about a
month ago.

I put the ghazal competition together, and wrote the first ghazal, but then
it was assembled by Terrie Relf, and given to August Highland for his Muse
Apprenticeshp Guild. I asked my poem to be taken out, as I had already
promised all this with an introduction to Larry Sawyer of Milk.  But August
Highland has kept it, indicating that Terrie Relf put the contest together.

This is a sort of Warholesque appropriationist strategy or something.  You
can just take anything and call it yours.  Not that the ghazal is mine!  But
I tried to get people to talk about this different aspect of Islamic
civilization originally, and I am still trying to get at some of the more
unknown aspects of that civilization.

Can anybody spell out the complex code of honor.  You have honor killings to
atone for a family's honor, for instance.  Sometimes it almost seems like
the mafia code.  But it's especially complex for women.  To have been raped
means that you have broken the honor code.  I'm not sure how the logic of
this works.  I saw a documentary called Honorable Murder a long while ago,
and I have  a vague memory of it explaining some part of this complex
cultural web for which we have no real equivalent.

It's been called to my attention that Caroline Crumpacker's announcement for today's bilingual reading omitted the venue.

Anyway it's 6:00 p.m. at Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, just north of Houston, in NYC.

Anne Tardos and I will be reading & performing poetry of Schwitters and Picasso -- very prolific poets so lots to cram into an hour or two.

For any who can make it ...

For those that went to other reading in the Bay Area... you missed a
wonderful reading  by Brenda Coultas from,  A Handmade Museum (Coffee
House Press, 2003). Magic realism in the real bowery poetic sense of
life, gritty, humorous, and beautiful.. if you have ever been to the
bowery, which is not to be missed, since it is soon to be disneyfied...
read this and smell the urine on the street and see the lost and found
faces. this is a wonderful book, I came home and finished it last
night, wonderful and beautiful. this is a book of time, date, scenes,
cinematic scope along with something that makes the bowery into a
museum of live art... read this book today and go for a walk in your
tenderloin (SF) and you may find a book looming as wonderful as this,,

JAZZ & THE WHITE CRITIC: THIRTY    YEARS LATER
http://www.amiribaraka.com/

The second article I published about the music, in Metronome,    was
J&TWC. The theme was, broadly, that a fundamental contradiction,
sharp,    at times antagonistic, existed between American Classical
Music, it's creators,    mainly Black, and the majority of commentators,

critics, critical opinion about    that music, which historically are
not.

The cause of this is obvious, whatever the slaves created was    owned
by the slave owners. The fundamental social philosophy characterizing
American Capitalism (and feudalism before that) has always been shaped
by white    supremacy, whether it was slavery or the national oppression

and chauvinism    that still exist today.

The fact that an oppressor nation could judge the creations of    the
people they oppress is not strange but "natural" in the context    of
the relationship between ruler and ruled. Just as the slave was part of
the    "Means of Production", (and when feudal slavery changed to
capitalist    slavery ) variable capital, so whatever was produced by
the slaves was, by definition,    part of what the owner of the slave
owned.

As "art", the music was useful as entertainment, social    control,
pedagogy, as commerce. Black Tom" the amazing 19th century slave
pianist, who knew 10,000 pieces of music and became a touring novelty,
known    throughout the South, even during slavery, is said to have
"made"    a million dollars for his owners!

In contrast, there were thousands of slave "entertainers"    confined to

a single plantation. At first despised in a utilitarian way, but
ironically, as democracy made it's tortured way toward the Afro American

their    cultural product was more and more co-opted, commercialized
and, nowadays, even    claimed.

To read Lincoln Collier or Richard Sudhalter, and their bizarre
ubermenschlichkeit is to be annoyed with a tinge of melancholy that our
oppressors    are, to quote poet, Robert Creeley, such "unsure
egotists". Like a    poem I wrote, MTV "We can have your life, without
being poor, &c"
The New Orleans Rhythm Kings, after the first years of the music's
emergence,    claimed that the Black musicians were white. The context
of a white racist superstructure,    i.e., institutions, organizations,
and the curricula, ideas and philosophies    those are meant to maintain

and forward. They are a reflection of the Monopoly    Capitalist
imperialist economic base, almost completely defining, "evaluating",
advancing dubious or ingenuously chauvinist theories, explanations,
about Black    Music, at this point through writing, other media,
reaching incredible proportions.    Each year floods of such mainly
superficial materials (from books, tv and radio    series, even
calendars, t-shirts, post cards) defining and classifying Black    Music

are produced.

It is this superstructure with its various critics, scholars,
journalists that have even succeeded in naming Afro --American Music,
"Rag    Time", "Jass & Jazz" (in their musical and non-musical
definition,)    "Swing", "BeBop", "Rock & Rol"l, all coined    as media-

driven generic titles, by this collection entity. Since the creators
of the music did not have the same access to publishing, writing. &c.

Max Roach tells how Duke Ellington lst told him that when we accept
and forward this essential commercial nomenclature, foisted on the music

by    others, same presence can then identify any thing commerce want as

that.

So that Paul Whiteman became "The King of Jazz", Benny    Goodman, "The
King of Swing", The Rolling Stones, "The Greatest    Rock & Roll Band in

The World". Then dig the grand larcenous essence    of commercial
Copperheads inducting Black Musicians into the Rock and Roll Hall    of
Fame when, Naw , Jimmy them dudes was playing Rhythm and Blues, BEFORE
THERE    WAS A ROCK OR A ROLL!

There is not general commercial label for the works of Bach, Brahms,
Beethoven, &c. That music is called, more precisely, "The Music of
Ludwig Beethoven". "The Music of Bela Bartok", then why not,    says
Roach, "The Music of Duke Ellington", The Music of Thelonius    Monk",
&c But then that would confer a station and dignity to The Music    the
racist superstructure has never wanted to allow.

To this day, there is not a single Afro American writer heading    up
the Jazz Section of a major newspaper! (Imagine there were only Afro
American    or other non- white writers who entirely monopolized writing

about European    Concert music!) During the hot sixties there were
black writers about the music    on the Village Voice, Philadelphia
Inquirer, Washington Post, but dig this,    when the hot times passed,
the most fortunate of these were made sports writers!    Get to that!
(Now what that mean, Jimmy?)

Stanley Crouch was the last surviving name by-lining writing about
the music. And I told him at a forum at the Village Gate, that the VV
was going    to sic him off in another direction, e.g., politics,
novels, the former which    he is completely off -the- wall, the latter
Öwell, ax his boys, Bellow    or Updike! I told Stanley, Gary Giddins
was going to get that main VV gig. And    while the editorial Iblis is
working his number Stanley has still not put out    a single book on the

music, though he is more knowledgeable about the straight    up history
of American Classical Music than most of the chosen at the Times,
Voice, &c

Why? (A good question buÖoy!) Is it, in this case, because    Stanley
could say some heavy stuff that perhaps dem udder guise wdnt dig? It
seems Die Ubermenschen hate for the darkies to sound knowledgeable about

anything,    even their own lives. But tell me this glaring ugliness of
arbitrary (racial?)    exclusion from access to professional position in

a subject which must bear    some relationship to Afro-America is not
dagger-sharp proof of the continuing    national oppression of the Afro
-American people , right now!

The ownership relationship of Big America to The Music has meant
denigration, marginalization, "covers" and dismissal. While European
concert music is produced in major US concert halls, theaters, played by

permanent    resident orchestras in cities across the country, while the

authentic Classical    Music of the US has historically been
marginalized, performed in the worst venues    available. The conductor
of the New York Philharmonic is paid 1.5 Million dollars    a year. This

music is called "Legit", i.e. "Legitimate",    historically Afro
-American music, by inference, is "Illegitimate".    In the NYTimes and
NJ Star Ledger, there is a category called "Music",    another called
"Jazz"!

What is even more disingenuous, as it is dishonest, is that within
the last decade or so, there has been a distinct movement issuing
crab-like    across the chauvinist US superstructure to systematically
distort the history    & development of The Music, but also it's class
origins in the marginalization    of this, only recently recognized by
Congress "American National Treasure".    One main distortion made
essentially by positing a simultaneous development    in the white and
black communities. Obviously chauvinist commentators, like    Sudhalter,

Collier, sickening with their disinformational denigration of Black
creativity, seek to construct , at the same time, a completely ersatz
meta-history    for it's actual evolution.

Collier's idiotic and bluntly racist attacks on Duke Ellington,
claiming, as the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, that Ellington's music is
just an    imitation of European concert music, flies in the face of
astute European commentators    like Ernest Ansermet, Ravel, Stravinsky,

Horowitz. Likewise, the testimonials    of even American popular artists

like Bix Beiderbecke, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby,    &c.

Obscenities like Collier's racism confirm and pipsqueaks some
continued legitimization of the general historic American chauvinism
toward    Black Music, including an earlier travesty such as The
American Pulitzer Prize    committee's refusal to award Duke Ellington
that prize in 1967, even though    their own group of judges named Duke
to receive the Pulitzer! The bitter absurdity    of all this white
supremacy is that Afro American music is in its total possession    by
the American people, American Classical Music!

People like George Gershwin, who literally learned at the feet    and
elbows of Willie "The Lion" Smith, James P. Johnson and Fats Waller
could be named Great Composers and live sumptuously, while his teachers
always    struggled for recognition even survival! Gershwin's
internationally acclaimed    masterpiece "Rhapsody in Blue" is clearly a

skillful recombining of    essential elements of James P.'s "Yamekraw
Rhapsody", orchestrated    by William Grant Still, performed at Carnegie

Hall 1927, with Fats Waller as    soloist!

Johnson, himself, was an awesome composer of extended works, at    least

two symphonies, "Harlem Symphony", '34, "Symphony in Brown",    '35.
Opera, one of which, "The Organizer", 1940 (with Libretto by    Langston

Hughes) was performed, like "Yamekraw", exactly Once, at    Carnegie
Hall! Duke's extended work, "Jump for Joy" performed, to    my
knowledge, about the same number of times. While Gershwin's estimable
"adaptation"    of these composers' works, is given grand presence as an

American Classic! Or    consider for a split second, in contrast to any
of the great Afro-American composers    the awesome tribute and major
repertory status given to Gershwin's "Porgy    and Bess", a work derived

directly from and shaped by Afro-American life    and culture.

The arrogant cultural and musical "autonomy" American    critics
bestowed upon Gershwin and the work was so aggressively and
subjectively    chauvinist that it even caused Ellington, usually a
consummate diplomat about    these things, to express his irritation
openly at such haughty white nationalism.

Yet, to be bluntly precise, just as the history of European
"Classical"    music would not be essentially changed by the exclusion
of the many non-European    artists who have contributed to it, by the
same measure Afro-American music,    which is the Soul of what must be
regarded as American Classical music, would    not be changed if not a
single white artist's contributions were included. And,    face it, this

analysis is not black chauvinism, but like they say, hard fact!

One important development and change in the US since my earlier
article, is that where I saw, as principal, the contradictory
relationship between    Black Music, it's creators, on one hand and The
White Critical establishment    on the other , today it should be more
and more obvious that that contradiction,    still, at times,
antagonistic, is, at base,, the contradiction of class and    class
"stance", distance and alienation, which exist generally in    bourgeois

society and are no less clearly perceivable in the context of this
relationship between "critic"and creator. Even though this
contradiction    is still most obviously visible as "Black Vs White".

That it, there has been, since the late 50's, a very visible and
impacting increase in the size and influence of the Black
petty-bourgeois (middle    class). This has been caused directly by the
political-social upsurge of the    period, of the Civil Rights-Black
Liberation Movement or more precisely what    substantive changes
occurred because of the interlocking force of the twined    Afro
American national movements for Democracy and Self- Determination,
one    aspect loosely labeled "integrationist", the other,
"separatist".    (The essentially anti-imperialist anti-war movement
should also be factored    into this analysis.)

Ironically, but predictable scientifically , this development    has
created a much larger "gap" between the burgeoning, but still    mustard

-seed sized, recently emerging Black petty bourgeoisie and the great
majority of Afro-Americans with
considerably more distance between the black majority and the so called
"neo-con"    (neo-conservative ) Negroes, now hoisted into profitable
visibility with attendant    official "Hoorahs" as a fallacious display
of American "democracy".

This has meant that more and more we see "well placed"    Negroes
co-signing the most backward ideas of the US rulers. The most bizzare
for instances, the "three blind mice" The Colon, The Skeeza and Tom
Ass, at the top of Bush-2's junta. They have been made seemingly
ubiquitous    by the power of relentless duplicity. At American Express,

Newsweek, across    the media, as film stars, &c.

In the field of Jazz commentary, we have Stanley Crouch, Albert
Murray, who have taken up many of the reactionary, even
white-chauvinist, ideas    of the racist U.S. superstructure and its
critical establishment. A few years    ago, at a Midwestern seminar
headed by Dave Baker, Crouch, in a discussion on    intellectual
contributions to The Music, and in response to this writer's
statement    that it should obvious that it has been Black people who
have contributed the    fundamental and essential intellectual
innovations to the music, spontaneously    ejaculated, that "Black
people have not contributed Ö" Breaking    the statement off in mid
ugly, apparently shocking even himself, at the ignorance    of his
intended comment. Especially, I would imagine, in the face of several
scowling "Bloods", most, prominent musicians, including Muhal Abrams,
who commented immediately on the tail of my repeated requests for
Stanley to    finish his thought!

Crouch also wrote more recently in the New York Times, that Black
musicians didn't like George Gershwin because he was a better composer
than    all of them (except Duke). It should be clear to most folks with

any clarity    that both statements are false and reek of the national
(racial) foolishness    that characterizes white supremacy. And this
from a "Negro" (as Crouch,    with objective accuracy, prefers to be
called)!

What it means is that the creators and artist-guardians of American
Classical music must create, as part of a revolutionary democratic
movement,    an alternative superstructure, i.e., institutions,
organizations, venues, critical    journals, in order to rescue the
history, socio-economic productiveness and    potential and even it's
artistic strength and free them and themselves from    dependence on the

socially exploitative and artistically diluting mechanisms    of
corporate commercialism and its attendant racism.

There is a howling need for more independent journals, performance
circuits, educational institutions, whose form and content relate
directly to    the artists, the history, the socio-economic and
political needs of the masses    of Afro -American people and to the
whole of the US majority itself.

The title "Ken Burns Jazz" is disheartening up front.    Whether there
is an apostrophe or not! It's always gratifying to see tapes and    cuts

of the musicians and hear some of the music. But it is maddening in
the    extreme not to hear them speak for themselves!

For all the petty jealously that Wynton Marsalis elicits behind    his
Lincoln Center visibility , even from otherwise knowledgeable people,
Wynton    was the single saving element to the series. Without him it
would have consisted    of almost random images and largely superficial
injections by Burns' obligatory    clutch of "ultimate" critics,
"scholars", "Gee Whiz"-ologists    and now a smaller group of Negro
autodidacts, Crouch, the most prominent, but    also a Negro "Gee Whiz"-

ologist, Gerald Early, who was an embarrassing    tourist of very
limited relevance to any serious discussion!

At one point, Crouch referred to the musicians in Ellington's    great
orchestra as "knuckleheads"! You mean Hodges, Gonsalves, Webster,
Carney, Tizol, Cootie, Tricky Sam, Blanton, StrayhornÖ&c.? What kind
of thoughtful analysis could come from such contempt? But such is one of

the    seamier products of the vaunted "social equality" of the fake
"post-    civil rights era". But in addition to this direct
class-deformed commentary,    a more subtlely obvious ignorance and
dismissal characterized the series as    "white critic, black musician
apartheid".

>From the top, Burns said he knew nothing about the music! Then    how
did he get to do a series? I wonder if the producers would allow some
similarly    self-described "Non" to do such a series on European
classical music?    Please!

But this similar "Gee Whiz!", essentially non-intellectual,    attitude
and method has always been allowed in what passes as serious
commentary    on the music because of the predominance of Afro- American

artists. It is a    ruthless paternalism!

This is one reason I support Marsalis' work of, to some extent,
archiving the music at Lincoln Center. By re-presenting the music's
classics    in repertory , a consolidating stability and status is
accorded to it, not seen    before. Just as Lincoln Center does its
annual "Mostly Mozart", we    should be gratified to see something like
a "Mostly Monk" repertory    established. Even if Marsalis' orchestra is

sometimes not fully up to the task    of say, reincarnating Duke
Ellington, but could Bernstein improvise like Herr    Beethoven?

The essence of Burns' piece is the implied ideological dictum    that
the collective "braintrust" Burns gathered , largely white, mainly
"un-hip", is the paradigm for the intellectual source for any lasting
analysis and measure of this music and that is the deepest content of
its vulgar    chauvinist presumptions.

This accounts for the general absence of any impressive philosophical
analysis of the music itself and except for Marsalis, scant discussion
of it's    changing genres as music as art or social expression!

What the music means, at a given period, as aesthetic, social    and
philosophical expression. Why it moved from one genre or style to
another.    Why the abiding classical elements of its constantly
reconfigured continuum?

Often specific musicians were characterized by racounteurish gossip
or cliched retellings of flaws in their personal lives. Sidney Bechet
described    as "a thug". The drawn out docudrama of Bird's drug
addiction, likewise    Billie Holiday, without a similar depth of
musical, aesthetic and philosophical    analysis of their music. Nor was

there a historical overview of these constantly    developing factors
intrinsic to the music.

Just serious interviews with a representative group of the great
musicians still around would have offered a much more profound composite

and    intellectual and social access to this still unplumbed cultural
treasure chest    of American culture and art. Far from opposing the
interview of critics, scholars,    writers, club owners, the greater and

more informed inclusion of the artists    themselves (not just
contemporarily but from existing archives) would have provided    a much

more incisive, scholarly and entertaining document to inform the ages.

Before saying "Later!", I would add that like Fred Douglass,    after he

whipped on the "white church" in his majestic "Fourth    of July" speech

and so had to make some slight qualification, if my analysis    of
"white critics" seems inaccurately sweeping, I should point out    that
at root it is aimed at "the establishment" of what passes and    has
passed, for over a century, as "Jazz Criticism"

I say this because some of the young critics I met when I first    came
to New York, Dick Hadlock (whom I worked for at "The Record
Changer"),    the always penetrating, Martin Williams (though we had a
running argument about    whether Billie Holiday sang the Blues or not).

Others like Larry Gushee, Dan    Morgenstern
(once he began to dig that the music did not stop after Duke Ellington,
if he    ever really believed that), my man, John Sinclair, the mixed up

Frank Kofsky,    I have always had respect for, whether we totally
agreed or not.

Still other "white critics" like the great Sidney Finklestein    was an
immense contributor to what storehouse of scientific discourse there
is about this music. I could add the redoubtable Stanley Dance,
Ellington's    shadow, not a deep thinker, (but European analysis of the

music for a long time    was always more objective and scientific) the
anthropologist Herskovits. There    were even some dudes we will always
jump on we learned something from, (I wont    even mention Nat Hentoff
till he returns from the land of national -liberal    crypto chauvinist
social- hypocrisy). Suffice it to say, there is That and there    is
Them. I know the difference.
But just to add some reminder of the kind of stilted hollowness most
commentary    on the music resembles, recently there was an article in
the New Jersey Star    Ledger , some of us call The Star Liar, by writer

George Kanzler. (How are you    spelling that?) In claiming to list the
musicians coming out of and associated    with Newark and environs, he
left out the following:.

** SALOME BEY, Lead Singer with Andy( Bey) & The Bey Sisters,
Jackie Bland, Leader of the legendary teenage bebop orchestra out of
which came    Wayne Shorter, Grachan Moncur 111, Harold Van Pelt , Hugh

Hey I do like 1.5 readings a year (last one was in
April I think--not including 5 minutes here and
there), so I don't know if this is too early to say

that I'll be reading on Sat. November 1

at Cornelia Street Cafe
at 6pm

as part of the Ziryab reading series--Ziryab is an
organization of Arab and Arab-American writers plus
their supporters.

There will be an oudh player!

(And if you tip well I will belly dance)

Sorry to name drop in the subject line but quickie last minute
self-promotion needs all the charge it can get.

I'm performing tomorrow, Sunday, with writer Melissa Ragona (we're doing
"soundscape") and dancers Eric Bradley, Douglas Dunn, and Nicholas Leichter.
They must think we're going to do something brilliant because we're last on
the bill!

Lots of great writers and dancers on the bill -- come out for some
good-spirited New York-style performance whatchamacallit!  (Boston won't
clinch it Sunday, don't worry.)

these pages are so ephemeral they're just about to disappear.
nothing lasts not even forever but an instant as well.
i may die at any time and sometimes i feel it coming on.
nightmares only point to uselessness of the physical.
i will say goodbye to you now before the net collapses.
suddenly our friends and neighbors vanish forever.
without our a@b addresses we are permanently lost.
diseases and wars take over from depression and suicide.
the cold expansion of the cosmos is closer than we think.
already i gave way to the latest new thing.
my fingers bleed and slip on decayed and corroded ontologies.
nine and a half thousand google hits weigh nothing at all.
like pascal i hold on against the abyss around my arms and hands.
plasmas and meteors take their share of fires and storms.
tornados and floods complete erasures of ten thousand hours.
or more than ten thousand hours and perhaps the history of humanity.
or the history of the earth and the history of the universe.
we're on the cusp of permanent forgetting.

housepress is please to announce the release of:

SAN'
by Lawrence Upton

24 pp, handbound.
75 numbered copies.
ISBN 1-894174-90-9
$7.00 including postage.

From the author's note:
"San' was the title of a one off book, produced by painting and =
collages, made as a present for Bob Cobbing on his 80th birthday, and =
presented to him in September 2000 at A day for Bob Cobbing. The idea =
was to really give something: I would no longer have it and did not =
expect it to be published. After Bob's death, Jennifer =97 Bob's widow =
=97 found the book among his possessions. At her suggestion, I borrowed =
it and used it as the starting point for a new set of images in Bob's =
memory. This is the new set of images. It retains a great deal of the =
original. "San'" represents the way "sound" was said in the street in =
the area in which I was brought up. This text, like the original given =
to Cobbing, is for utterance and movement."

About the author:
Lawrence Upton's directionless career terminated with four years as =
"Head of Academic Computing" at a Greater London college, from which he =
retired due to ill health in 1996. He has been making poetry for nearly =
four decades and is prolific in a variety of writing genres. He was a =
member of "jgjgjg" and other performance groups; and produced =
electro-acoustic pieces at West Square Studio. His collaboration and =
performance practice has persisted and developed, with many colleagues =
especially, latterly, the late Bob Cobbing. He co-edited the influential =
anthology Word Score Utterance Choreography in verbal and visual poetry =
(1998) with the late Bob Cobbing; and now he co-directs Writers Forum =
Workshops and Writers Forum, the publishing imprint.

Chris Stroffolino's low-fi versifications come deftly
from his keyboardist's fingers.  His work idles fast
and gallops urgently, daring the reader to roll her
eyes as high as he does: =EC must murder memory's cozy
/ propensity for familiarizing / as numbers 'tame'
savannahs into streets."  Stroffolino's a Shakespeare
scholar and lead croaker for Continuous Peasant whose
debut album, EXILE IN BABYVILLE is just out on
Goodforks. Forthcoming in fall of 2003 is a chapbook,
Scratch Vocals (Potato Clock). Tougher Disguises will
bring out a full-length book of his poetry,
Speculative Primitive in 2004.  He teaches at St.
Mary's College.

Dan Fisher waxes lyric with distinctly Oakland
mannerisms=F3he has walked the lake and ended up at the
Stork Club with inked up matchbooks.  His poetry tells
sad stories with a jubliance usually only known to
country singers:  =ECThe yee-haw nights deliver us from
swinging / saloon doors.  To retell under smoke rings
/ the vagaries of a dream, our mouths would / remain
pursed to the love of talking.=EE  Fisher is the
publisher of Flotsam Press, a letterpress chapbook
series, and the co-editor of A Very Small Tiger, a
forthcoming poetry journal of brutal repercussions.
Recent work has appeared or will be appearing in Barn
(v.) and Pink Squid, and will be making familiar
objects be as if they were not familiar.  He is
currently in the M.F.A. program at Mills College.


Please come to upcoming events!

November 16th: kari edwards and Chris Nealon
December 10th : Barbara Joan Tiger Bass and Aidan
Thompson***
January 18th: Genevieve Kaplan & Juliana Spahr

***please note the December reading has been moved to
Wednesday.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has one of the most oppressive religious
societies on earth. I lived in Riyadh (but not in a compound totally
insulated (however that insular safety net changed recently) from the rest
of society) for a year.

I will never forget when an American diplomat's son took me to the so-called
junk souk on the outskirts of Riyadh. It was in the middle of the afternoon.
The call-to-prayer was given and a man in his immaculate white dish-dash
appeared with what looked like the fanbelt from a car engine in his hand,
threateningly harrassing the shopkeepers to close their shutters. His black
skin was in stark contrast to his robe. A former slave? (Slavery was
officially banned in 1963 in Saudi Arabia.)

This man was a religious policeman, a mutawah. The tell-tale short
dish-dash, normally worn right down to barely touch the ground, was the
give-away.

Yeah, we ought to invade Saudi Arabia if Iraq is an oppressive regime. But,
then, Saudi Arabia wasn't behind the "slippery" anthrax in the envelopes
sent to Dashle and Leahy, was it?

Hi folks,

Just wanted to let you know that acclaimed poet Sergey
Gandlevsky--who was recently named "most important living
poet" in Russia--will have his selected poems in my
translation shortly forthcoming from Zephyr Press.
Gandlevsky melds a slangy vernacular with traditional forms,
in a poetry that witnesses to the underground life of a
bohemian traveler and debauchee during the twilight of the
Soviet regime.

We will be doing a few readings in neighborhoods perhaps near
you.  If you're interested in coming to a reading, please let
me know and I'll give you all the pertinent details when they
are finalized.  This is the list of reading locations, by
date:

11/5/03 TBA College of Wooster (Ashland, OH)

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="Windows-1252"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Truck, an Artist Run Centre in Calgary, and dANDelion, a literary =
magazine based out of Calgary, are looking for submissions for a =
collaborative group show and special issue on the theme of Disaster! =
Truck and dANDelion are combining forces to take on Disaster! and want =
works, both literary and visual (and everything in between) that engage =
with this theme from any approach, whether the disasters in question are =
natural or manmade, political, aesthetic or personal. We live in an age =
that thrills to disasters, fascinated and horrified and all too often =
entertained by them. Works may deal with the representation or =
aesthetics of disaster (CNN, Titanic, Celine Dion in Las Vegas), =
disaster as formal technique (found poetries/art, language that breaks =
itself apart, unfinished/unfinishable projects), to the topical =
treatment of disasters themselves: from the new =93epidemics=94 (SARS, =
West Nile, Mad Cow, Monkey Pox); the collapse of ecosystems; the =
disappearance of political dissent; terrorist strikes, counterstrikes, =
and =93humanitarian assistance.=94

We welcome imaginative use of our two spaces: Truck=92s physical gallery =
space and dANDelion=92s publication space. We challenge visual artists =
to consider how their work can play between the page and the wall and =
between the temporary and documentary. We challenge writers to imagine =
their work as performance and to visualize their text as material. With =
all these possibilities in mind, we welcome and encourage collaborative =
submissions from artists and writers. Take note, however, that not all =
work published in dANDelion may have a place in the Truck show, and work =
accepted by Truck may not necessarily appear in the pages of dANDelion.

 If your project is primarily a visual piece, please see submission =
guidelines at www.TRUCK.ca and send proposals and no more than ten =
slides (with slide list) to Truck:

Programming Committee=20

If your project is primarily language-based in nature, please see our  =
general submission guidelines at www.english.ucalgary.ca/dandelion and =

presents

writer Jim Paul
visual artist Greg Benson

Saturday, October 18, 7pm
Dinnerware Gallery
210 N. Fourth Avenue

Admission: $5; Students $3

Jim Paul is a poet and writer living in the Rincon Mountains east of Tucson.
His new novel, Elsewhere in the Land of Parrots, was published in summer
2003 by Harcourt. He is also the author of Catapult: Harry and I Build a
Siege Weapon and Medieval in LA (both Harvest books) and of The Rune Poem,
published by Chronicle Books. His poems have appeared in The New Yorker, the
Paris Review, Poetry, and elsewhere.

Greg Benson is a Tucson mixed-media artist and a founding member of
Dinnerware Artist’s Cooperative, a non-profit exhibition space. Since 1975,
Benson has been working on an ongoing series of mixed media works on paper
and unstretched canvas. His work is characterized by an aerial perspective
that is often found in naive or primitive art. Says Benson: “I am intrigued
by the real history of America and I pursue this research with a passion and
continually include my findings in my paintings.”

POG events are sponsored in part by grants from the Tucson/Pima Arts
Council, the Arizona Commission on the Arts, and the National Endowment for

Subject:      Question re Translation Copyright
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

A Polish writer and I are translating the works of an influential
avant-garde Polish poet who died in the early 80s. We've a number of his
poems translated into English and are set to begin sending them to American
mags and journals. But we have a question: how does copyright work for
translation?; that is, does one need to secure copyright at all for
translations -- and if so do we need to do that before we try to publish them?

Thanks for any feedback.

Gabe: Yes in theory, tho in practice not usually. It rather depends on how
litigious the poet or in this case the heirs are likely to be.

I think most mags will require a translator to have permission from the
author/estate who owns the copyright unless the material is in the public
domain. Certainly a book publisher would.

It may also depend on whether the author/estate has already sold
English-language rights to the material (for instance, another translator or
English-language press could be planning a full translated edition and may
have paid for the right to publish the material in English).

But permissions are usually easily obtained, and for unpaid publications
such as literary journals, they should come free or inexpensively.

Gabe,

I'm no expert, but I second Shanna Compton's post and would only add that my understanding is that it is not necessary to acquire permissions if your use of the translation is not for profit. That is, if you sell the translations or provide them to someone else who will sell them (non-free mags, journals, book publishers), you need permission. Otherwise (if you were going to give them away or just use them for classes), not. Perhaps someone else knows the law more specifically.

But this leads to the interesting question of translations in free web publications. Why should a web publication afford special legal exemption from acquiring permission (and reduce the rights of the copyright holder) simply because it's produced in a cheaper, more publicly accessible medium? Especially when it is sure to reach more people than most print journals? Perhaps there have been legal rulings on this issue recently? Anyone?

For Sentence, I require proof of permission to publish translations, unless the work is clearly in public domain.

Dear Gabe:

There is little chance that you will be sued for infringing someone's
copyrights if you publish a translation of someone's poetry.  The only
reason for this is that international lawsuits are expensive and there isn't
really any money in poetry.  That said, if you publish your translations
without securing permission, you can be sued not only by the heirs, but also
by the Polish publisher and anyone else who might hold exclusive rights to
translate into English.

I advise erring on the side of caution.  Fax the publisher and ask for
non-exclusive worldwide rights to publish a translation in the English
language only.  Also be sure to say that if they do not hold full rights, to
please let you know who does.  If you are only going to be publishing the
translations in journals and magazines and have no intention of publishing
them in book form, you can ask for serial rights or just first serial
rights.  The less you ask for, the more likely you are to get rights.  (And
you probably won't have to pay anything.)

Also, if the translations will appear on the Internet (a journal has print
and online versions) you will need to ask for electronic rights.

If you need more help, I can email you a copy of the letter we have sent out
in the past that has worked.

Sincerely,

Gabe,  I have done a lot of research on this topic due to translating Philippe
Soupault and Henry Levet from French.  The basic rule is life plus fifty years, or
in some cases complete works plus fifty years for any country that is signatory to
the universal copyright convention.  However, if you are going to publish it in a
journal, and not in a book, then usually there are no translation costs involved,
unless you are to be paid for them a substantial amount.  Since most poems make
less than fifty dollars (I've made that much at Partisan Review and maybe one or
two other places) and since litigation costs are so high, no judge is going to
care.  Books, however, are different, and you need to make a deal with the
original publishing house unless the author owns ALL the rights.  Every country is
unfortunately a little different -- the Portuguese at least ten years ago when I
checked had a ridiculously long time that they kept a work out of the public
domain -- life plus 500 years.  I still can't believe that's true, but I read the
clause over and over, and it seemed to be so.  Usually, you are doing a poet a
favor by keeping their work alive, so the public domain is life plus fifty years,
but in literary journals, where there is no money around anyway, from what I've
heard nobody cares even if you are translating Neruda (I heard this from a Neruda
translator who found this loophole for literary journals).

I hope this is accurate info.  Frankly, nobody seems to really care, but if you do
publish a book, technically the original company can sue you (they must get a US
Lawyer and go to court and get an injunction), but I've never heard of anybody
actually having this done to them.  And all sorts of people have published books
of great French poets without getting permission.

The university presses are touchier about this, but I've seen lots of chapbook
translations of people like Soupault.  Pat Nolan told me he didn't have the rights
and just laughed about the idea.  He published his translations at a small press
in California whose name I forget -- four trees or something.

On the other hand when I published some Levet translations in Partisan Review they
contacted Gallimard and Gallimard asked for some money.  Like 50 dollars a poem.
Even though Levet had been dead since 1906!  Partisan Review paid.  Technically, I
don't think they had to do it, but they did it to be safe.

I wish I knew more about this.  Another related thing is that APPARENTLY there is
a law that says that you can't publish criticism about a poet's work and publish
ANY part of their poems without express permission from the rights holder because
ANY part of a poem is so valuable to the whole that you are taking too much of the
work if you even publish one line without permission.  Again, this doesn't matter
in newspapers and journals, but in books, you have to get permission.  I have
contacted lawyers about this, but nobody seems to know anything at all about it.
In publishing my first book I ran into this problem with a poet, and it almost
wrecked the book.  Since then, I have always gotten permission from a poet in
writing that gives me carte blanche if I planned to write anything of any length
on them.  I contacted Gregory Corso before I wrote a single line on his work, and
he gave me permission for all his poems.  Then, New Directions nevertheless asked
for three hundred dollars for the poems that they own.  It was a fair price, I
guess.  At any rate, my college paid the fee.

I wish the law was more clear on these points, but I think it is waiting for a
costly suit in order to be clarified and nobody right now really cares.  Before
you do too much work, I'd contact the original publishers, and try to get a deal
signed so that you are covered.  With your name and reputation you should be able
to accomplish this.

Oh yes, one more thing.  Every country has its own formalities.  I thought I knew
French when first dealing with Soupault's editors.  But the elaborate system of
hierarchies I didn't know, and thought this was a purely commercial transaction.
It turned out to be an elaborate dance along the lines of a production in Louis
XIV's court, and I ended up stepping on people's feet.  I learned this by the time
I got around to translating Levet.  So I never went back to Soupault's editors --
one of whom is an American millionaire -- but he is the silent partner.  I had
translated two of Soupault's novellas and found a publisher for each of them.  The
deal never took place because I honestly didn't know how to finesse the protocol.
WIth Levet I waited for the complete works plus fifty years to transpire -- and
then published them in Jacket 17 a year ago or so.  I would never translate
anything for which I didn't have the rights ever again, or which was not already
clearly in the public domain.  I did a book for Routledge a few years back --
Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen's Story of Anna O., but I knew Mikkel, and was sure that
there would be no hassles.  The French only deal with editors, not translators,
I've discovered, and they want the houses to be permanent, generally.  I don't
know anything about the Polish -- but since they are no doubt proud and therefore
difficult, I would approach them with extreme caution, and take only non-exclusive
rights, etc., etc.  to calm them down.

I wish I could hear other disaster stories on this front.

Poland signed the Berne convention in 1920, and the treaty says this
about translations:

"Authors of literary and artistic works protected by this Convention
shall enjoy the exclusive right of making and of authorizing the
translation of their works throughout the term of protection of their
rights in the original works." (article 8)

see http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo001en.htm

It might be interesting to know that in the mid 1800's translations
were regarded as new works that could be made and published without
the permission of the original author. The translation itself
however, could be copyrighted, but one translator could not oppose
another to do a new translation of the same original work.

Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was translated into
German without her consent, but the trial Stowe v. Thomas in 1853
ruled in favor of the defendant. The court found that a translation
might be called a transcript or copy of her thoughts or conceptions,
but in no correct sense could it be called a copy of her book. In
1870, however, it was enacted that "authors may reserve the right to
translate their own works". The Berne convention did not give authors
full protection regarding translations until 1908.

David and all, sorry--that was dumb of me...The reading, at SUNY Buffalo's
Center for the Arts, was great.  I never got to see bpNichol, certainly not
the Four Horsemen, read and while Dutton has his own unique set of sounds
and gurgles that he likes to work through, his reading gave me some sense
of the seriousness involved (training the voice) in performing what to some
can sound wildly ridiculous!

If you were unable to make it a video of Paul's Dutton's reading will be up
on the EPC very soon.

Best, Lori

"Sometimes you feel like a nut; sometimes you don't"

Maria --

hadn't in fact opened my ballot yet -- I assume you didn't mean to imply
that the other candidate IS a nut -- as it turns out, this is one of those
rare years when both candidates have done some really great things for the
field over the years -- and are good friends --

but since you asked, you get my vote -- If I lived in the old Baltimore or
New York, I could vote for both of you!  I was nominated years back, for
this and other divisions -- but was always running against somebody from a
"name" school and invariably lost -- now I'm at a "name" school, but am too
old to care anymore --- but still want to see all my good divisions in good
hands -- am happy to see two such fine candidates on the ballot  --

Do I at least get a good, old style corrupt politics free beer if you win?

Less people get confused and think they can take off with both the milk
bucket and the cow, permission must be gotten for a book publication.

Gabe, if your ultimate intention is a book, it's probably best to start
negotiating now. Robert Mezey and Richard Barnes - who spent 10 years
translating Borjes complete poems and assumed - from some conversations with
the widow that they would have a contract for a book - were deeply
disappointed by the infamous Agent Wiley who got to B's widow with much
bigger coins and a whole different set of translators.

Richard Barnes, sadly, passed away. But, I suspect, if one is interested and
tracked down Mezey, their samizdat Borjes translation can be obtained.

There are a tremendous number of sad stories floating around about translation
rights.

However, I wanted to point to a tangential issue which can be just as
hair-whitening.  In order to publish criticism of a book of poetry, and in order
to cite even one line, you are supposed to have permission to do this.  Even one
line of a 200-line poem has to have a garnered permission slip from the owner, or
sometimes the owners, of the poems.

I ran into this with a chapter in my book Comedy after Postmodernism.  I had
thought that the "fair use" stipulation applied, and was quoting a poet, but when
I asked for rights, this poet said no way.  He didn't like what I had written!  As
it turned out, I had to cut the chapter.  I took most of the technical ideas and
recycled them in another article I wrote, so it wasn't a waste, and actually I was
trying to do the poet (who doesn't have much or any critical writing about his
work) a favor.  Surprise!!

The legal precedent apparently has to do with the poet-critic Yvor Winters who
worked at Stanford or Berkeley in the 50s and was slashing the throats of the
competition.  He wasn't merciless, but he was writing stuff that Wallace Stevens
and others didn't appreciate, and so a number of poets got together and made a
suit in which they claimed that EVERY line is integral to a poet's work.  And so
even one line in a novel for instance has to be paid for.  Even one line in a
critical book has to be paid for, or at least permission has to be granted.

In reality, I doubt if there are any suits.  It costs proably ten grand to
initiate a law suit and carry it through, but with lawyers for the arts even an
impoverished poet could probably manage this.

In newspaper and journal reviews, or even in articles the stipulation doesn't
apply, but in books, it does.  This is why when you read Yvor Winters he is
killing Wallace Stevens for being a pagan without any sense of transcendence but
he doesn't give examples, which is how it's normally done.  You can read a whole
book and not find an example.  It's because permission wasn't given.

I would love to find the legal paperwork having to do with this case, but although
I know lawyers, I don't know any copyright lawyers.  There are probably a number
of them in Albany, NY an hour away, but who on earth would know about poetry
copyrights!  Poetry is hardly even a cottage industry.  Lawyers usually want
something more substantial to slice their teeth into.

I have heard horror stories about how impoverished critics have had to lay down
three hundred dollars or a thousand to publish a poem they wish to critique in a
book.  Meanwhile, fiction falls into the realm of fair use.

Could anybody give me their experience of this?  I had never heard of it before
this happened, and I have never heard of it since.  The law itself if it truly
exists is probably buried somewhere in some law journal from the 1950s and hasn't
been opened since.  It would seem to me that this would hurt the art of poetry if
anything because it would tend to slow freedom of discussion, and even go against
the idea and principle of the first amendment.  As a critic, I now get a full
release form (non-exclusive world rights) from any poet I'm working on, or from
the estate, and would never even think on working on a difficult poet.  If I sense
any tension whatsoever, I close the file and advise all and sundry to do the same.

Anyone is welcome to quote me in their book. And not only don't they have to
pay me, I'll pay them! 10 cents a line, up to ten lines. If the book makes
the NYT Bestsellers List, I'll double the payment, and throw in a free
autograph, as I'm in a Christian mood today, the bells from the church down
the street rattling my brains.

Dear Michael Rothenberg -- Perhaps you can use the poem below for Big =

Ochs, and published in my first book MERCURY VAPOR LAMP [Ocooch Mountain =
Press]. =20

This sounds like an attempt to overprotect and - deceive. I would
very much like to see a judicial decision of some sort arriving at
that. I know that many publishers (especially in the US) list the
sources and rights for each and every line from a popular song that
happen to appear in a novel, for instance, but I believe this is
probably overprotection, especially if they have paid for the use
too. Like all those disclaimers you read on software packages or
labels that tell you not to try to shave with your lawn-mower etc.

The right to quote is really an essential part of copyright, one of
the exceptions in the author's monopoly, that is what he or she
actually "pays" in order to get this privilege.

article 10 of the Berne convention says:


>       (1) It shall be permissible to make quotations from a work
>which has already been lawfully made available to the public,
>provided that their making is compatible with fair practice, and
>their extent does not exceed that justified by the purpose,
>including quotations from newspaper articles and periodicals in the
>form of press summaries.
>
>       (2) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of
>the Union, and for special agreements existing or to be concluded
>between them, to permit the utilization, to the extent justified by
>the purpose, of literary or artistic works by way of illustration in

>provided such utilization is compatible with fair practice.
>
>       (3) Where use is made of works in accordance with the
>preceding paragraphs of this Article, mention shall be made of the
>source, and of the name of the author if it appears thereon.
>


So, pretty much is left to the courts to decide, but the general
'esprit' of this law text is that it must be regarded as permitted to
use a fair amount of a published works for critical or educational
purposes. Regarding the amount that may be quoted, this is supposed
to be pretty short, but general application of this law in most
countries permits for instance the use of a whole poem, say of 10
lines, to be quoted in an article about a poet. What courts usually
consider here is whether the quotations are made to "illustrate"
one's own critical or journalistic reasoning, or if the quotations
are actually the main part of the new work and the quoting author's
own text is merely meaningless glue.

Wasn't Juliana Spahr one of these MLA people -- was she poetry division?
I remember voting for her.  And she wasn't on the California ballot a
few weeks ago.

My mail hasn't come yet today.

The Suny/Buffalo Electronic Poetry Center, under the
direction of Loss Glazier, has added an ongoing
list of bloglinks (weblogs) which can be accessed at
http://epc.buffalo.edu/connects/blogs.html. An identical
list can also be accessed at my weblog
 -fait accompli- http://nickpiombino.blogspot.com/.

The list will be updated regularly. Most of the
bloggers on this list update their blogs several
times a week so visit often! Nearly all
have email addresses so you can communicate with
the bloggers directly. Although most of the blogs
on this list focus on a range of poetry and poetics
interests, you will find diarists, humorists, bloggers
with a political bent, bloggers with a wide range
of interests and concerns, such as history, astronomy,
ecology, anthropology and some bilingual blogs, including
one in French and English and another in Spanish and
English. Today on a blog I found out that the Supreme
Court rejected the Bush Administration attempt to
dismantle state medical marijuana laws; I found out
the Red Sox won a ball game; I read movie reviews and
book reviews, a discussion of linebreaks in poetry, and
a discussion of a poet's retreat involving 34 poets in
Philadelphia; I read experimental poetry and lyrical
prose poetry, and an aphorism by Valery; I read about a
 blogger's screenplay in process and the new book by
Salem Pax, the "Baghdad Blogger";I read about what's
 happening in the poetry reading scene in San Francisco
and Boston, and in depth analysis of the
most recent Segue series reading at the Bowery Poetry
Club in Manhattan, and much more. There are bloggers on
this list from New York, San Francisco. San Diego, Chicago,
Boston,Tijuana,Mexico, Venezuela, France, several cities in Canada
and even one from Gansk, Poland! Anybody who knows me,
or anything about my writing of late, knows how much
I enjoy blogging and blogs. If you are curious to know
more about blogging, or at least my thoughts about it,
recently I was interviewed, mostly on this topic
by poet-musician Lewis LaCook in the poetry e-magazine
Sidereality, http://www.sidereality.com/main.htm,

The Frame Around Arnold
George Lakoff, AlterNet
October 13, 2003
Viewed on October 15, 2003

Newspaper and TV reporters require a story. Each story requires a frame.
How was the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger framed? Here is a
selection:


Voter Revolt: Gray Davis was such a bad governor that the voters
justifiably ousted him and voted in the representative of the other
party.


The Great Noncommunicator: Gray Davis governed as well as possible under
the circumstances, but was so bad at communicating with the electorate
that he could not communicate his real accomplishments, nor could he
communicate the role of the Republicans in the state's problems. The
public thought Davis was worse than he was and wanted a communicator, so
they voted him out and chose an actor.


Those Kooky Californians: People in California are so weird that they
voted a politically inexperienced bodybuilder-actor into office to
replace a governor they voted for just last year.


The People Beat the Politicians: When the people win, politics as usual
must lose (Schwarzenegger's acceptance speech).


Just a Celebrity: People don't understand politics and just voted for a
celebrity.


Up By his Bootstraps: Coming here as an immigrant, Arnie worked and
worked to become a champion body-builder, then a millionaire actor, and
finally achieved his dream -- becoming governor.


Framing was rampant in reporting in this election. Frames come with
inferences, so each framing implies something different.


The "Voter Revolt" frame legitimizes the recall. It assumes that Davis
was incompetent or corrupt, that the voters correctly perceived this,
that it outraged them, that they spontaneously, righteously, and
overwhelmingly rose up and ousted him, replacing him with someone they
knew to be more competent. Democracy was served and all is well. We
should be happy about the result and things will be better.


The "Great Noncommunicator" frame implies that the one and only problem
was Gray Davis' inability to communicate. It assumes he was a competent
governor and a responsible administrator with that single fatal flaw,
that people want communication so badly that they recalled Davis because
he couldn't communicate his achievements. The implication is that the
recall and Schwarzenegger's election had nothing to do with anything
outside California or anything broader, and that the problem just was
Davis.


The "Kooky Californians" frame says the recall was irrational, that
Californians can't tell the movies from reality, that a move action hero
can't govern a great state in trouble, that Arnie is a political
incompetent and that chaos will ensue.


The "People Beat the Politicians" frame is Schwarzenegger's attempt to
impose his own frame. The context is that Arnold will have to deal with
a majority Democratic legislature. This frame casts himself and the
Republican politicians as "the people" and the Democrats as "politics as
usual," which "the people" voted against.


The "Just a Celebrity frame" implies that there was no partisan politics
in this election and that any celebrity at all could just as well have
won.


The "Up by his Bootstraps" frame attributes Arnold's election
principally to Arnold himself, especially to his hard work and ambition.
Arnold got to be governor because he deserved it. He deserved it because
he worked hard -- at body-building, acting, and campaigning.


If there's going to be a news story, there's going to be a frame and
each frame will have different inferences.


Facts and Framing


It is a general finding about frames that if a strongly held frame
doesn't fit the facts, the facts will be ignored and the frame will be
kept. The frames listed above don't do very well at fitting the facts --
though each has a grain of truth. Let's look at the facts that each
frame hides.


Voter Revolt: This frame hides the national Republican effort over
several years to make Davis look bad by hurting the California economy.
It hides the fact that energy deregulation was brought in by Republican
governor Pete Wilson. It ignores the fact that there was no real "energy
crisis." It resulted from thievery by Enron and other heavy Bush
contributors, thievery that was protected by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission run by Bush appointees. The Bush administration
looked the other way while California was being bilked and went to great
lengths not to help California financially in any of the many ways the
federal government can help. Arnold had had a meeting with Ken Lay and
other energy executives in spring 2001 when Lay was promoting
deregulation, but denies any complicity in the theft. Arnold is now
promoting energy deregulation again.


It also ignores the fact that California's Republican legislature also
went out of its way to make Davis look bad, refusing to support
reasonable measures for dealing with the budget problems. It ignores the
fact that the recall petition was paid for by a wealthy conservative
legislator and that signature gatherers were paid handsomely and that
some signatures were from out of state, which is illegal. And it ignores
the enormous amount of money and organization put into the
Schwarzenegger campaign by Republicans. This was no simple popular
revolution. Most of all, the "Voter Revolt" frame does not explain why
Schwarzenegger should have been the candidate chosen.


The Great Noncommunicator frame has a lot of truth to it. But it too
hides all the sustained Republican effort, and it also hides the fact
that it is not just Gray Davis, but rather Democrats in general, who
cannot communicate effectively.


The Kooky Californians frame does not explain any of the above. The
Republicans' long-term, carefully structured anti-Davis campaign is
hidden by this frame. It is as if there were no politics at work here at
all.


The People Beat the Politicians frame hides the fact that the
Republicans have been playing politics with the state finances for years
in an attempt to beat Davis. It hides the fact the Schwarzenegger team
run by former governor Pete Wilson will be just as much "politics as
usual," and that the Democratic representatives in the legislature
numerically represent more of "the people" than do the Republicans.


The Just a Celebrity frame ignores all the above political factors, and
also cannot explain why this particular celebrity won. Jay Leno
supported Arnold; Jay is just as much a celebrity, but Jay Leno could
never have been elected governor.


The Up by his Bootstraps frame also ignores all the politics involved
and doesn't explain why other movie actors who pulled themselves up by
their bootstraps didn't run and wouldn't have been elected.


These framings hide other important facts as well. They don't explain
why a lot of union rank-and-file members ignored their unions' support
for Davis and voted for Arnold against their self-interest. They don't
explain why a great many Hispanics voted for Arnold instead of
Bustamante. They don't explain Arnold's popularity with women despite
the revelations against him of sexist behavior.


The Moral Politics Analysis


I'm going to offer a very different account of the Schwarzenegger
victory, based on my book 'Moral Politics.' Since the book was written
in 1996 and updated in 2002, the account I'll be giving is a general
one, based on a general understanding of American politics, not on the
special facts about this election. My resulting claim is that much of
what occurred in the recall election is the same as what has been going
on for some time in American politics. The Schwarzenegger election, I
propose, should not be seen as an entirely unique event, despite having
unique elements, but rather part of the overall political landscape.


In 'Moral Politics,' I suggested that voters vote their identity -- they
vote on the basis of who they are, what values they have, and who and
what they admire. A certain number of voters identify themselves with
their self-interest and vote accordingly. But that is the exception
rather than the rule. There are other forms of personal identification
-- with one's ethnicity, with one's values, with cultural stereotypes,
and with culture heroes. The most powerful forms of identification so
far as elections are concerned are with values and corresponding
cultural stereotypes. The Republicans have discovered this and it is a
major reason why they have been winning elections -- despite being in a
minority. Democrats have not yet figured this out.


The 'Moral Politics' discovery is that models of idealized family
structure lie at the heart of our politics -- less literally than
metaphorically. The very notion of the founding fathers uses a metaphor
of the nation as family, not as something we think actively about, but
as way of structuring our understanding of the enormous
hard-to-conceptualize social group, the nation, in terms of something
closer to home, the family. It is something we do automatically, usually
without consciously thinking about it.


Our politics is organized around two opposite and idealized models of
the family, the strict father and nurturant parent models.


The nurturant parent family assumes that the world is basically good and
can be made better and that it is one's responsibility to work towards
that. Accordingly, children are born good and parents can make them
better. Both parents share responsibility for raising the children.
Their job is to nurture their children and raise their children to be
nurturers. Nurturing has two aspects: empathy (feeling and caring how
others feel) and responsibility to take care of oneself and others for
whom we are responsible. These two aspects of nurturance imply family
values that we can recognize as progressive political values: From
empathy, we want for others: protection from harm, fulfillment in life,
fairness, freedom (consistent with responsibility), open two-way
communication. From responsibility there follows: competence, trust,
commitment, community building, and so on.


From these values, specific policies follow: Governmental protection in
form of a social safety net and government regulation (as well as the
military and the police), universal education (competence, fairness),
civil liberties and equal treatment (fairness and freedom),
accountability (from trust), public service (from responsibility), open
government (from open communication), and the promotion of an economy
that benefits all and functions to promote these values. The role of
government is to provide the infrastructure and services to enact these
values and taxes are the dues you pay to live in such a civilized
society. In foreign policy, the role of the nation should be to promote
cooperation and extend these values to the world. These are traditional
progressive values in American politics.


Different Family Values


The conservative worldview is shaped by very different family values.


The strict father model assumes that the world is and always will be
dangerous and difficult and that children are born bad and must be made
good. The strict father is the moral authority who has to support and
defend the family, tell his wife what to do, and teach his kids right
from wrong. The only way to do that is painful discipline -- physical
punishment that is to develop by adulthood into internal discipline.
Morality and survival jointly arise from such discipline -- discipline
to follow moral precepts and discipline to pursue your self-interest to
become self-reliant. The good people are the disciplined people. Once
grown, the self-reliant disciplined children are on their own and the
father is not to meddle in their lives. Those children who remain
dependent (who were spoiled, overly willful, or recalcitrant) should be
forced to undergo further discipline or cut free with no support to face
the discipline of the outside world.


Project this onto the nation and you have the radical right-wing
politics that has been misnamed "conservative." The good citizens are
the disciplined ones -- those who have already become wealthy or at
least self-reliant -- and those who are on the way. Social programs
"spoil" people, giving them things they haven't earned and keeping them
dependent. They are therefore evil and to be eliminated. Government is
there only to protect the nation, maintain order, administer justice
(punishment), and to provide for the orderly conduct of and the
promotion of business. Business (the market) is the mechanism by which
the disciplined people become self-reliant, and wealth is a measure of
discipline. Taxes beyond the minimum needed for such government are
punishments that take away from the good, disciplined people rewards
that they have earned and spend it on those who have not earned it.


In foreign affairs, the government should maintain its sovereignty and
impose its moral authority everywhere it can, while seeking its self
interest (the economic self-interest of corporations and military
strength).


How We Vote


Given these distinctions, there are the natural complications of real
people. Such models are there in the synapses of our brains. When we
vote on the basis of values and cultural stereotypes, what determines
how we vote is which model is active for understanding politics at the
time.


We all have both models -- either actively or passively. Progressives
who can understand an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie have at least a
passive version of the strict father model alongside the active
nurturant model that defines their politics. Conservatives who can
understand the Bill Cosby show have at least a passive version of the
nurturant model.


But many people -- often enough to decide elections -- have active
versions of both models that they use in different parts of their lives.
There are strict fathers in the classroom who have progressive politics.
There are strict fathers on the job who are nurturant parents at home.
Many blue collar workers are strict fathers at home, but nurturant
toward their co-workers. Union employees tend to be strict toward their
employers and nurturant toward union members. Women tend to have active
nurturant parent models, but a significant number accept the authority
of the strict father, are strict mothers, or may have some significant
fear. Fear triggers the strict father model; it tends to make the model
active in one's brain.


What conservatives have learned about winning elections is that they
have to activate the strict father model in more than half of the
electorate -- either by fear or by other means. The 9/11 attacks gave
the Bush administration a perfect mechanism for winning elections. They
declared an unending wear on terror. The frame of the War on Terror
presupposes that the populace should be terrified, and orange alerts and
other administration measures and rhetoric keep the "Terror" frame
active. Fear and uncertainty then naturally activate the Strict Father
frame in a majority of people, leading the electorate to see politics in
conservative terms.


Enter the Terminator


Enter The Terminator! -- the ultimate in strictness, the tough guy
extraordinaire. The world champion body-builder is the last word in
discipline. What better stereotype for strict father morality? That is
the reason that it was Arnold -- not just any celebrity like Jay Leno or
Rob Lowe or Barbra Streisand -- who could activate a strict stereotype
and with it conservative Republican values.


What is peculiar to California is Arnold and the culture of the movies.
But the same mechanism lay behind the Republican victories in the 2002
election -- and in elections around the country since the days of Ronald
Reagan -- but especially in the last decade when Republicans have
mastered the art form of activating the strict father image in the minds
of voters. Arnie's popularity has the same source as Bush's popularity
with the Nascar dads: identification with strict father values and
stereotypes. Moreover, Davis' inability to communicate strong
progressive values is hardly unique to him. Democrats nationwide have a
similar inability to effectively and strongly communicate their values
and evoke powerful progressive stereotypes.


In addition, Davis made the bad mistake of accepting the DLC's metaphor
of campaigning as marketing. In the DLC model, you look for a list of
particular issues that a majority of people, including those on left,
support. In the last congressional election it was prescription drugs,
social security, and a woman's right to choose. If necessary, you "move
to the right" -- adopt some right-wing values in hope of getting
"centrist" voters. Davis, for example, favored the death penalty, tough
sentencing, and supported the prison guards' union. It's a
self-defeating strategy. Conservatives have been winning elections
without moving to the left.


By presenting a laundry list of issues, Davis and other democrats fail
to present a moral vision -- a coherent identity with a powerful
cultural stereotype -- that defines the very identity of the voters they
are trying to reach. A list of issues is not a moral vision. Indeed,
many Democrats were livid that Arnold did not run on the issues. He
didn't need to. His very being activated the strict father model -- the
heart of the moral vision of conservative Republicans and the most
common response to fear and uncertainty.


In short, Arnold's victory is right in line with other conservative
Republican victories. Davis' defeat is right in line with other
Democratic defeats. Unless the Democrats realize this, they will not
learn the lesson of this election.


Right-Wing Power Grabs


And indeed, conservatives are busy trying to keep Democrats from
learning this lesson. There is an important frame we haven't mentioned
yet: The Right-Wing Power Grab frame. Davis used this at the beginning
of his campaign, and Clinton and the Democratic presidential candidates
who supported Davis echoed the frame. This frame does accurately
characterize many of the facts as we have discussed them. But Davis was
unable to communicate this frame effectively and it fell from public
sight. The day after the election it was one of the few frames not
mentioned by the mainstream media. It has been dropped by the Democrats
but kept alive by the Republicans, who are using it to taunt and
delegitimize Democrats. They are using the "Voter Revolt" frame to argue
that the "Right-Wing Power Grab" frame was inaccurate.


Here's how the argument goes. The Right-Wing Power Grab frame implicitly
accuses the Schwarzenegger campaign of deception, of failing to admit
connections to Karl Rove and the national Republican apparatus and of
misrepresenting the facts -- many of which we have discussed above. A
"power grab" is illegitimate, using either illegal or immoral means to
attain power. The Republicans manipulated the media using some of the
frames we have discussed to hide facts and create false impressions.
From the perspective of the facts we have discussed, the election does
seem to fit the Right-Wing Power Grab frame.


In the wake of the election, the Republicans have grabbed onto the
Democrats' previous use of the Right-Wing Power Grab frame, arguing from
the Voter Revolt interpretation of the election to claim that there was
no power grab at all, that the election simply expressed the will of the
voters. The very fact that Arnold got a strong plurality -- and near
majority -- in the election is used as prima facie evidence that the
Voter Revolt frame is the correct way to interpret the election. But as
we have seen, that frame hides exactly the facts that the Right-Wing
Power Grab frame illuminates.


The Democrats ignore the power of framing at their peril.

concerning fair use within the US, but only within books.  And I checked this from
about a dozen sources.  I checked with lawyers, etc.  I can't believe it, either.
I wish I could find the actual legal wording having to do with this.  All that I
know is that Yvor Winters lost his case.  I wish somebody knew something beyond
this.  It's NOT over-protection.  EVERY line of a poem or a song is considered
integral to the work, and HAS to have permission, and that's why you see it in
every novel, etc.  Even a single line from a poem can fetch 500 dollars if within a
big novel of some kind.  I too think this is not how it SHOULD be, but it actually
IS this way.  I find it appalling, and would love to trace the legal lineage, but
don't have a law library within a sixty mile radius.  -- Kirby

All--

Karl-Erik has it right.  People quote poetry all the time in critical
articles and reviews under the "fair use" doctrine (and without paying or
getting permission).  A good explanation of the doctrine can be found on the
web at "www.fairuse.stanford.edu."  The site also explains other key
copyright concepts.  "Fair use" doesn't depend on whether the material
quoted is poetry or prose or whether the borrower publishes in book or
article form, as some on the list have suggested.  Instead, there is a
four-factor test that is explained on the web site  The factors are:  (1)
whether the material is used in a creative way and transformed (e.g., by the
critical insights the borrower brings to bear on the material); (2) the
nature of the work borrowed from (too complicated to summarize here); (3)
how much is borrowed (here poetry, because it is short, is dangerous to
quote, but there is no absolute rule against quoting even all of a short
poem); and (4) whether the quotation harms the copyright owner's chance to
make legitimate money off his work (e.g., you give away the big revelation
in a tell-all book, so people don't have to buy it).  The courts are also
influenced by whether they perceive either the copyright owner or the
borrower to be a good or a bad guy.

This is a squishy test, and it's hard to predict how a lawsuit would turn
out if it's ever brought.  That's why lawyers have jobs.  A cynic would say
that lawyers make sure that the rules are always unpredictable and hard to
apply, so that they always have work.  My law professors would say that it's
just impossible to write clear, "bright-line" rules that will work in the
complexities of the real world.  Although I've been a lawyer now for far too
long, I tend to think the cynics are right.

I found the Stanford web site by googling "copyright fair use."  It called
up other sites as well, and each site links to others.  Hope this is helpful
to the list.

I'm working on a translation of medieval Portuguese/Galician women's songs
that date from the 900's to the 1300's.  The edition I'm using is from
around 1911.  I'm hoping not to have to get permissions, assuming I ever
find a publisher.  Good luck to all the other translators out there!

Thanks to all who responded f/c and b/c. The other translator and I had
heard conflicting advice. Your responses have been very helpful to us, and
will, I'm sure, save us some headaches down the way.

Thank you.

The Tulse Luper Suitcases Project with Peter Greenaway
October 16, 2003 at 8 p.m.
Peter Greenaway introduces two segments from The Moab Story, and Antwerp,
elements of his ambitious trilogy The Tulse Luper Suitcases. Greenaway's
multimedia epic (a "personal history of Uranium") presents some sixty years
of recent history---from the discovery of uranium in 1928 to the 1989 end
of the Cold War---through the life and times of the fictitious, bigger-than-
life Tulse Luper.


Alice, 1987, with Rose Hobart, 1936, By Night with Torch and Spear,
undated, and Fast Film, 2003
November 13, 2003 at 8 p.m.
November 14, 2003 at 8 p.m.
Jan  Svankmayer’s Alice, 1987, a contemporary surrealistic take on Lewis
Carroll’s Wonderland, is introduced by two shorts by American Surrealist
Joseph Cornell. The program will conclude with Fast Film, Virgil Wildrich’s
animated tour-de-force (and blend of Cornell’s passions---cinema,
Hollywood, and collage). Presented in recognition of the centennial of the
artist’s birth.



I'm looking forward to witnessing both of these presentations at the
Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC.  Assuming that Peter Greenaway has been
touring, I wonder if anyone reading my post has caught this particular
act?  It's hard not to notice his overtly literary subject matter at times,
and one might expect PG to receive poetic attention.  Although I assume
Greenaway is most often taken to be a visual artist, his English language
the stuff of artists' books, and somehow "outside the realm of
consideration".  I've seen Joseph Cornell's ROSE HOBART [17 minutes,
premiered at the Julien Levy Gallery in 1936] at least twice, and I'm
looking forward to the third occasion.  Cornell, who supposedly never owned
a movie camera, here presents us with a film distinctively his own, despite
the fact that he edited it from a 1931 "jungle B-film" starring the actress
Rose Hobart.  Though his source was a "talkie", Cornell insisted that ROSE
HOBART be projected at silent speed, with a blue tint, and accompanied by
two campy cuts from an album he scouted in a Manhattan thrift shop.
Certainly a precedent for some independent filmmakers (Ken Jacobs, Larry
Jordan, Stan Brakhage, Jack Smith, & ...) who knew him and/or shot footage
under his direction in NYC after WWII.  They were eventually included under
Jonas Mekas' formulation "New American Cinema", itself a term bearing a
curious relation to Donald Allen's "New American Poetry".  If you have the
occasion, I recommend a visit to the Cornell remains--held by the Archives
of American Art in Washington DC.  --  Barry Alpert

The DWP Free Journal is currently accepting submissions of poetry, fiction,
artwork, photography, etc.

Issue #1/2, our promotional issue is featured in our online archives @
www.dissociatedwritersproject.com

Issue #3/4 is due to come out this week, and issue #1 in one month,
featuring an interview with Fugazi's Ian MacKaye, a story by Matthew Derby,
and poetry by David Berman.

Video art is also accepted, home movies, etc., to be published in our online
journal.

The journal format is more like a punk 'zine than anything else. We won’t
guild the truth and tell you this is purely an aesthetic choice. It’s also
because we’re underfunded. That said, part of the vision of the editorial
staff is to make it free, and so make it easy to photocopy and redistribute.
Every issue will have a blank page for the readers to put their work in,
photocopy it and send it to friends and relatives. We're reaching a
different audience than the standard literary journal. Because the journal
is photocopied, many of our distributors are just people all over the
country with access to photocopy machines, people in offices, elementary
school principals, etc.

We'd love to offer everyone a fortune to contribute. But unfortunately, the
DWP Free Journal can't pay
it's contributors. All of the money we have is earned from benefit concerts,
which certain DC punk
bands have volunteered to hold for us in venues along the eastern seaboard.
This amounts to
barely enough to cover mailing expenses. So we're hoping that you'll see the
merits of what
we're doing here in DC as reason enough for contributing.

If you'd like to get copies of our promotional issues and/or any future
issues, get on our mailing list @ www.dissociatedwritersproject.com, and
we'd be happy to send one to you.

Thanks,
Brad Senning

Paula, This is true for articles in journals, but I am 99% sure that it doesn't
hold for books.  I have had to pay whenever I published books, and every critic
that I know has had to pay.  I have published two books.  You can get a release
from some companies, but in my experience this has never happened gratis.  I
would acquiesce on this matter, but it is actually quite surprising.  In my
experience, fair use does not exist in regards to poetry.  If I could see it
written in a legal journal, and also absolute clarity regarding what constitutes
fair use, then I would be satisfied.  Is it 40% of a poem?  What if the poem is
only two lines long, and so you are quoting with one line 50% of the poem?  This
is a very troubling, very murky matter.  Somehow we need to find the Yvor
Winters case, which I am told set the precedent.  Anybody who could find this
case would help clarify this matter.  Ask any critic who has published a book of
criticism on poetry and they will tell you about the fees involved.  I know one
critic who had to pay one thousand dollars out of his own pocket for the rights
to publish three poems by a contemporary poet.

There is of course work that is in the public domain.  It is safe to write about
anybody who's been dead for a hundred years.  Shakespeare, Edward Lear, for
instance.  But even in those cases you often have a copyright on a given
edition.

And each different translation is of course copyrightable, or else just anybody
could pirate the work of the translator.  These rules are surprisingly clear,
whenever I've dealt with them, but I can't find an original source book.  I
really wish that I could -- but it would have to be from an actual legal
publisher before I trusted it.  Most copyright books on the mass market deal
with very general cases, and almost nobody ever deals with poetry.

Any more info that anybody can get on this matter would be greatly appreciated.
As for now, I will not work on contemporary poets unless I get a signed sheet
that guarantees that I will be able to publish whatever I think whether the poet
likes it or not.  This is a nightmare, and is very bad for poetry, I think.  To
stifle free discussion like this is not good for any art form.

There is a similar stipulation in dance.  Some dance directors have been known
to make their dancers ineligible to discuss a work in which they are dancing.
That is, they may not ever say a single sentence in writing or in interviews
regarding the work or else they can be penalized by the director for breach of
contract.  This sort of thing is completely menacing to the arts.  I know many
dancers who have been muzzled in this way by their contracts.

...from the new issue (Oct 15-21) of the Durham NC's _Independent
Weekly_:

Best Bet
"In Poetic License," p. 6
Poets Against the Shrub
Thursday, Oct. 16
Temple Ball/De La Luz, Carrboro

Five local poets join forces to "support our troops" and "defy our
leader" when Poets Against the Shrub liberates some pent-up politics at
Temple Ball, Thursday, Oct. 16. Among the performers are Wake Forest
University English professor Evie Shockley, Fayetteville, N.C. Quaker
House Director Chuck Fager, local poet and musician shirlette ammons,
poet, musician and artist Doug Stuber, and Carrboro Poet Laureate
Patrick Herron. Herron, who is also the organizer of the event, says the
inspiration behind the performance came from a desire to "let people
hear poetry that may reflect the discontent many artists feel with the
mad pace at which the Bush Administration is evaporating human lives,
civil rights, and tax dollars-all for their personal gain." He hopes to
raise money for groups who "work to protect the rights of all citizens
to vote," as well as give locals a chance to "raise our voices, shake
our fists, call some jerks some nasty names, and even laugh together."
Mock "Dumya." Hear good poetry. Support a cause. 8 pm.

Chris,
Your TexFiles Blog (http://www.texfiles.blogspot.com) rocks.  Of course,
Barry's last name is spelled "Schwabsky"....and, hey, since I'm posting anyway, do
allow me to do publisher's duty and use this to report (by lazily cutnpasting
from moi blog):


BARRY SCHWABSKY IN NEW YORK, PHILADELPHIA AND SAN FRANCISCO...AND PUBLISHERS
WEEKLY

DUM DA DA DUM! The lovely <A HREF="http://www.shampoopoetry.com/ShampooFour/killian.html">Kevin Killian </A>just informed me that <A HREF="http://meritagepress.com/opera.htm">Barry
Schwabsky's book OPERA </A>had been featured in the September issue of Publisher's Weekly
(PW)! Since I didn't fork over the hundreds of dollars required to be a PW
subscriber, I didn't see the article when it came out. But here's the text below!
And, apparently, PW rarely reviews "first books" but this mention was part of
a "feature article" on first books, of which Barry's book was the first
listed!

September 1, 2003
Publishers' Weekly [P. 85-86]
"Fall First Book Blow Out"

Putting 20 years of work into one intensely wrought luminously gripping book,
Artforum critic Barry Schwabsky here stages his Opera : Poems 1981-2002. His
approach to the eponymous form -- colloquial, lived-in, forking the vulgar
tongue, mixing in trailer park trash talk, throwing out references to
Wittgenstein, Larbaud and Traherne -- rises to the other-worldly.
Meritage Press, Small Press Distribution, 104 pages, ISBN 0970917929.

So this seems like a good reason to remind you all of Barry's schedule over
the next couple of weeks, culminating with a reading with Moi. You may want to
catch him while he's in the U.S. since <A HREF="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n08/schw01_.html">Barry lives in London</A>:

All events are free and open to the public. Wine will be poured in New York
and San Francisco.

These three events revolve around celebrating the release of Barry's book
OPERA. Here's some of the early reviews on it:

FROM <A HREF="http://www.shampoopoetry.com/ShampooSixteen/sprague.html">JANE SPRAGUE'S </A>ARTICLE IN BOOG CITY, SEPTEMBER ISSUE:
As a one-person publishing endeavor (and the assistance of a poet-intern)
Tabios spends a year working on the production of each book. The latest Meritage
book, <A HREF="http://meritagepress.com/opera.htm">OPERA: Poems 1981-2002</A>, by <A HREF="http://www.artcritical.com/blurbs/BSFisher.htm">Barry Schwabsky </A>exemplifies Tabios' intent
for the press, which is "to publish those who otherwise may not ever be
published, a difficulty beyond the general poetry threshold difficulty. In
(Schwabsky's) case, this is a poet who's been invisible in the poetry scene for over a
decade, despite a brilliant start by being published in POETRY at age 19! OPERA
encompasses 21 years of writing which occurred outside of any poetry scenes,
having been developed mostly in private."

OPERA is a remarkable book. Ideas of song, language play, and delicate
negotiations of desire and love create poetry deft and strange- strangely beautiful
and bound with dual meanings, the piecing apart of things, of language, of the
unsaid, the left out, the impossible to contain. From the title poem,
"Opera":

Corrected hair. Face smooth
as mirror. Unsurpassable song.
Living death. Unhanded. Unhanded.
Theatrical weeping. "He" becomes "she"
and "you" becomes "he" and "we"
becomes "we" becomes "we" becomes "we."
Pears shaped like apples. Pears
that taste like apples that taste like grapes. (10)

Schwabsky pairs words with their opposite and twins images that resonate in
the ear and on the page. Words are repeated, then altered, then paired again or
broken apart newly, revealing other hidden/revealed aspects of the voices
between this "we" grappling with the doubleness of desire and experience and
their (our) shared complications. The final poem:

Clearing

Favorable moonlight
in all directions. Don't try
and make it real. You'll never have that experience
long enough to write about. Someone else's voice

will have to burn with it. You keep
starting something you don't know how to stop
but it stops. (102)

The doubleness of love, desire, of thinking in language, emotion and image in
simultaneity and how to reconcile aspects of "we" among others, of
individuals in the blur of longing where boundaries mesh, dissolve, break and give way
to something more: those moments of "the nothing / but desire / you've seen / I
am." (45)


FROM CHRIS MURRAY'S <A HREF="http://texfiles.blogspot.com/">TEXFILES BLOG</A>:

These extremely artful poems, individually (including the writer's careful
attention to minute details in each poem) and then again as an intriguing whole,
fascinate me. They draw one in from both perspectives, the large and the
smaller views, simultaneously--a not uncomfortable predicament in terms of result,
per the ways Schwabsky sends forth this verbal art. They are like looking at
one of those photographs of an object, say, a face, enlarged to consume an
entire wall, but of course up close each point of what was thought to be the
comfortable blur of plain graininess actually turns out to have other entire
images--full of other stories--at work within the whole. Captivating, almost
overwhelming, but in ways well worth contemplating, studying forth.


==============

ADVANCE WORDS ON OPERA:
[And do check out links to blurbers' names for some interesting stuff!]

The word "song" resonates over and over and the poems here will often
suddenly burst into an intricate, complicated melody.
--<A HREF="http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/glazier/prose/juliana.html">Juliana Spahr</A>

His poetry is exactly as strange as the familiar may permit. His work, born
of a strange encounter between American poetry and European masters such as
Celan and Novalis, always surprises me by its exploratory investigations. He
writes one of the most loving poetries today, filled with a sexual myth as strong
as anyone's.
--<A HREF="http://www.raintaxi.com/online/2002fall/shapiro.shtml">David Shapiro</A>

These might be choruses and arias from some lost Venetian music drama of the
early 1600s--an allegory of the nature of light and of desire, set on one of
those abandoned islands where every imaginable encounter becomes
possible--transmuted over the intervening centuries of silence into a software program for a
new species of lyrical electronica.
--<A HREF="http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/essays/obrien-b2.html">Geoffrey O'Brien</A>

Imagine poems written by Sir Walter Raleigh after he has read Wittgenstein
and Lorine Neidecker, listened to bands whose names weren't in the air but whose
one song was on the airwaves, and learned more about contemporary art than
anyone thought possible, and you might get a sense of the compactness of these
poems, an airy abstract density unlike anyone else's.

Interesting, but I think that the recall was a lot simpler. If
Schwarzenneger hadn't entered the campaign the recall probably wouldn't
have succeeded, and if it had Bustamante would have won, tho neither Davis
nor Bustamante were particularly attractive candidates. It was the action
hero thing did it. The balance in the election was voters who had never
bothered to register before and who thought the film character was the
man--hence Arnie's constant reminders of his films in his political
appearances.

And he is not I repeat not a studio plant!  Here are all the details
of this San Francisco performance:

Poets Theater

Saturday October 18, 7:30 pm
@ Unitarian Center, $10 donation
1187 Franklin Street (at Geary)

an evening to benefit Naropa Audio Archive Project
and The Poetry Center's American Poetry Archives

The Big Keep, new play by Kevin Killian, featuring Anne Waldman (as
Lauren Bacall), Kota Ezawa (as Lars von Trier), Jocelyn Saidenberg
(as Jorie Graham), Wayne Smith (as St. John of the Cross), Rex Ray
(as Kevin Killian), Cecilia Dougherty (as Frieda Hughes), Mary Kite,
Karla Milosevich, Will Yackulic, Steve Dickison, Tanya Hollis, Zakary
Syzmanski; incidental music by Steven Taylor.

In an alternate universe, funding rains down upon the Poetry Center,
St. Mark's Poetry Project, and the Audio Archives at Naropa
University.  Poetry Center Director Steve Dickison's got so much
money he pays poets fabulous sums and lights his cigars with $500
bills in his Learjet.  The Poetry Center's a gilded showplace, and
thousands stand on line to see and hear its legendary backlist of
video and audiotapes.  But when Steve fires his celebrity
spokeswoman, Jorie Graham, and her spiritual confessor St. John of
the Cross, replacing them with his latest enthusiasm, fabled screen
star Lauren Bacall, all hell breaks loose.

Anne Waldman stars as Lauren Bacall, pursued by her Danish 'Dogme 95'
director Lars von Trier (Kota Ezawa).

"The Big Keep" is fantasy, melodrama, sci-fi, and poets' theater all
rolled up in one big ball of agitprop, designed to help support the
fight for preservation of endangered tape materials of readings from
the past 50 years at three great organizations. And Steve Dickison
plays himself.

Kevin Killian lives in San Francisco and, with Dodie Bellamy, has
edited over 100 issues of the writing/art zine they call Mirage
#4/Period[ical].  He is a poet, playwright, novelist, art writer, and
biographer; his books include Shy, Arctic Summer, Bedrooms Have
Windows, Little Men, and Argento Series.

The play all started about a year or so ago when Mary Kite on behalf
of the Audio Archives Project at Naropa asked me to write a play that
would raise public consciousness about the necessity for preservation
of poetry readings that are now fading away on audiotape and
videotape.  I said, "Sure, why not?"  Then she said that Anne would
be in it and that Anne would like to play Lauren Bacall.  "That's a
great idea," I said.  "And Steven Taylor will come and play music on
stage."  "The more the merrier," I said, hanging up, without an idea
in my head about how to make this all come together.  Flash forward
to a year or so later, and I'm just finishing up the play now, so
come on Saturday and see what happens!  NB, the play was designed so
that Anne could stage it very simply in whatever city she happened to
be in, with a pick up cast of poets, artists, filmmakers, musicians,
as we do here in SF.  But now I'm afraid the play is "too San
Francisco" and that audiences elsewhere won't get it.

You tell me!  But if you like poetry you'll like this.

Interesting, but I think that the recall was a lot simpler. If
Schwarzenneger hadn't entered the campaign the recall probably wouldn't
have succeeded, and if it had Bustamante would have won, tho neither Davis
nor Bustamante were particularly attractive candidates. It was the action
hero thing did it. The balance in the election was voters who had never
bothered to register before and who thought the film character was the
man--hence Arnie's constant reminders of his films in his political
appearances.

The Frame Around Arnold
George Lakoff, AlterNet
October 13, 2003
Viewed on October 15, 2003

Newspaper and TV reporters require a story. Each story requires a frame.
How was the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger framed? Here is a
selection:


Voter Revolt: Gray Davis was such a bad governor that the voters
justifiably ousted him and voted in the representative of the other
party.


The Great Noncommunicator: Gray Davis governed as well as possible under
the circumstances, but was so bad at communicating with the electorate
that he could not communicate his real accomplishments, nor could he
communicate the role of the Republicans in the state's problems. The
public thought Davis was worse than he was and wanted a communicator, so
they voted him out and chose an actor.


Those Kooky Californians: People in California are so weird that they
voted a politically inexperienced bodybuilder-actor into office to
replace a governor they voted for just last year.


The People Beat the Politicians: When the people win, politics as usual
must lose (Schwarzenegger's acceptance speech).


Just a Celebrity: People don't understand politics and just voted for a
celebrity.


Up By his Bootstraps: Coming here as an immigrant, Arnie worked and
worked to become a champion body-builder, then a millionaire actor, and
finally achieved his dream -- becoming governor.


Framing was rampant in reporting in this election. Frames come with
inferences, so each framing implies something different.


The "Voter Revolt" frame legitimizes the recall. It assumes that Davis
was incompetent or corrupt, that the voters correctly perceived this,
that it outraged them, that they spontaneously, righteously, and
overwhelmingly rose up and ousted him, replacing him with someone they
knew to be more competent. Democracy was served and all is well. We
should be happy about the result and things will be better.


The "Great Noncommunicator" frame implies that the one and only problem
was Gray Davis' inability to communicate. It assumes he was a competent
governor and a responsible administrator with that single fatal flaw,
that people want communication so badly that they recalled Davis because
he couldn't communicate his achievements. The implication is that the
recall and Schwarzenegger's election had nothing to do with anything
outside California or anything broader, and that the problem just was
Davis.


The "Kooky Californians" frame says the recall was irrational, that
Californians can't tell the movies from reality, that a move action hero
can't govern a great state in trouble, that Arnie is a political
incompetent and that chaos will ensue.


The "People Beat the Politicians" frame is Schwarzenegger's attempt to
impose his own frame. The context is that Arnold will have to deal with
a majority Democratic legislature. This frame casts himself and the
Republican politicians as "the people" and the Democrats as "politics as
usual," which "the people" voted against.


The "Just a Celebrity frame" implies that there was no partisan politics
in this election and that any celebrity at all could just as well have
won.


The "Up by his Bootstraps" frame attributes Arnold's election
principally to Arnold himself, especially to his hard work and ambition.
Arnold got to be governor because he deserved it. He deserved it because
he worked hard -- at body-building, acting, and campaigning.


If there's going to be a news story, there's going to be a frame and
each frame will have different inferences.


Facts and Framing


It is a general finding about frames that if a strongly held frame
doesn't fit the facts, the facts will be ignored and the frame will be
kept. The frames listed above don't do very well at fitting the facts --
though each has a grain of truth. Let's look at the facts that each
frame hides.


Voter Revolt: This frame hides the national Republican effort over
several years to make Davis look bad by hurting the California economy.
It hides the fact that energy deregulation was brought in by Republican
governor Pete Wilson. It ignores the fact that there was no real "energy
crisis." It resulted from thievery by Enron and other heavy Bush
contributors, thievery that was protected by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission run by Bush appointees. The Bush administration
looked the other way while California was being bilked and went to great
lengths not to help California financially in any of the many ways the
federal government can help. Arnold had had a meeting with Ken Lay and
other energy executives in spring 2001 when Lay was promoting
deregulation, but denies any complicity in the theft. Arnold is now
promoting energy deregulation again.


It also ignores the fact that California's Republican legislature also
went out of its way to make Davis look bad, refusing to support
reasonable measures for dealing with the budget problems. It ignores the
fact that the recall petition was paid for by a wealthy conservative
legislator and that signature gatherers were paid handsomely and that
some signatures were from out of state, which is illegal. And it ignores
the enormous amount of money and organization put into the
Schwarzenegger campaign by Republicans. This was no simple popular
revolution. Most of all, the "Voter Revolt" frame does not explain why
Schwarzenegger should have been the candidate chosen.


The Great Noncommunicator frame has a lot of truth to it. But it too
hides all the sustained Republican effort, and it also hides the fact
that it is not just Gray Davis, but rather Democrats in general, who
cannot communicate effectively.


The Kooky Californians frame does not explain any of the above. The
Republicans' long-term, carefully structured anti-Davis campaign is
hidden by this frame. It is as if there were no politics at work here at
all.


The People Beat the Politicians frame hides the fact that the
Republicans have been playing politics with the state finances for years
in an attempt to beat Davis. It hides the fact the Schwarzenegger team
run by former governor Pete Wilson will be just as much "politics as
usual," and that the Democratic representatives in the legislature
numerically represent more of "the people" than do the Republicans.


The Just a Celebrity frame ignores all the above political factors, and
also cannot explain why this particular celebrity won. Jay Leno
supported Arnold; Jay is just as much a celebrity, but Jay Leno could
never have been elected governor.


The Up by his Bootstraps frame also ignores all the politics involved
and doesn't explain why other movie actors who pulled themselves up by
their bootstraps didn't run and wouldn't have been elected.


These framings hide other important facts as well. They don't explain
why a lot of union rank-and-file members ignored their unions' support
for Davis and voted for Arnold against their self-interest. They don't
explain why a great many Hispanics voted for Arnold instead of
Bustamante. They don't explain Arnold's popularity with women despite
the revelations against him of sexist behavior.


The Moral Politics Analysis


I'm going to offer a very different account of the Schwarzenegger
victory, based on my book 'Moral Politics.' Since the book was written
in 1996 and updated in 2002, the account I'll be giving is a general
one, based on a general understanding of American politics, not on the
special facts about this election. My resulting claim is that much of
what occurred in the recall election is the same as what has been going
on for some time in American politics. The Schwarzenegger election, I
propose, should not be seen as an entirely unique event, despite having
unique elements, but rather part of the overall political landscape.


In 'Moral Politics,' I suggested that voters vote their identity -- they
vote on the basis of who they are, what values they have, and who and
what they admire. A certain number of voters identify themselves with
their self-interest and vote accordingly. But that is the exception
rather than the rule. There are other forms of personal identification
-- with one's ethnicity, with one's values, with cultural stereotypes,
and with culture heroes. The most powerful forms of identification so
far as elections are concerned are with values and corresponding
cultural stereotypes. The Republicans have discovered this and it is a
major reason why they have been winning elections -- despite being in a
minority. Democrats have not yet figured this out.


The 'Moral Politics' discovery is that models of idealized family
structure lie at the heart of our politics -- less literally than
metaphorically. The very notion of the founding fathers uses a metaphor
of the nation as family, not as something we think actively about, but
as way of structuring our understanding of the enormous
hard-to-conceptualize social group, the nation, in terms of something
closer to home, the family. It is something we do automatically, usually
without consciously thinking about it.


Our politics is organized around two opposite and idealized models of
the family, the strict father and nurturant parent models.


The nurturant parent family assumes that the world is basically good and
can be made better and that it is one's responsibility to work towards
that. Accordingly, children are born good and parents can make them
better. Both parents share responsibility for raising the children.
Their job is to nurture their children and raise their children to be
nurturers. Nurturing has two aspects: empathy (feeling and caring how
others feel) and responsibility to take care of oneself and others for
whom we are responsible. These two aspects of nurturance imply family
values that we can recognize as progressive political values: From
empathy, we want for others: protection from harm, fulfillment in life,
fairness, freedom (consistent with responsibility), open two-way
communication. From responsibility there follows: competence, trust,
commitment, community building, and so on.


 From these values, specific policies follow: Governmental protection in
form of a social safety net and government regulation (as well as the
military and the police), universal education (competence, fairness),
civil liberties and equal treatment (fairness and freedom),
accountability (from trust), public service (from responsibility), open
government (from open communication), and the promotion of an economy
that benefits all and functions to promote these values. The role of
government is to provide the infrastructure and services to enact these
values and taxes are the dues you pay to live in such a civilized
society. In foreign policy, the role of the nation should be to promote
cooperation and extend these values to the world. These are traditional
progressive values in American politics.


Different Family Values


The conservative worldview is shaped by very different family values.


The strict father model assumes that the world is and always will be
dangerous and difficult and that children are born bad and must be made
good. The strict father is the moral authority who has to support and
defend the family, tell his wife what to do, and teach his kids right
from wrong. The only way to do that is painful discipline -- physical
punishment that is to develop by adulthood into internal discipline.
Morality and survival jointly arise from such discipline -- discipline
to follow moral precepts and discipline to pursue your self-interest to
become self-reliant. The good people are the disciplined people. Once
grown, the self-reliant disciplined children are on their own and the
father is not to meddle in their lives. Those children who remain
dependent (who were spoiled, overly willful, or recalcitrant) should be
forced to undergo further discipline or cut free with no support to face
the discipline of the outside world.


Project this onto the nation and you have the radical right-wing
politics that has been misnamed "conservative." The good citizens are
the disciplined ones -- those who have already become wealthy or at
least self-reliant -- and those who are on the way. Social programs
"spoil" people, giving them things they haven't earned and keeping them
dependent. They are therefore evil and to be eliminated. Government is
there only to protect the nation, maintain order, administer justice
(punishment), and to provide for the orderly conduct of and the
promotion of business. Business (the market) is the mechanism by which
the disciplined people become self-reliant, and wealth is a measure of
discipline. Taxes beyond the minimum needed for such government are
punishments that take away from the good, disciplined people rewards
that they have earned and spend it on those who have not earned it.


In foreign affairs, the government should maintain its sovereignty and
impose its moral authority everywhere it can, while seeking its self
interest (the economic self-interest of corporations and military
strength).


How We Vote


Given these distinctions, there are the natural complications of real
people. Such models are there in the synapses of our brains. When we
vote on the basis of values and cultural stereotypes, what determines
how we vote is which model is active for understanding politics at the
time.


We all have both models -- either actively or passively. Progressives
who can understand an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie have at least a
passive version of the strict father model alongside the active
nurturant model that defines their politics. Conservatives who can
understand the Bill Cosby show have at least a passive version of the
nurturant model.


But many people -- often enough to decide elections -- have active
versions of both models that they use in different parts of their lives.
There are strict fathers in the classroom who have progressive politics.
There are strict fathers on the job who are nurturant parents at home.
Many blue collar workers are strict fathers at home, but nurturant
toward their co-workers. Union employees tend to be strict toward their
employers and nurturant toward union members. Women tend to have active
nurturant parent models, but a significant number accept the authority
of the strict father, are strict mothers, or may have some significant
fear. Fear triggers the strict father model; it tends to make the model
active in one's brain.


What conservatives have learned about winning elections is that they
have to activate the strict father model in more than half of the
electorate -- either by fear or by other means. The 9/11 attacks gave
the Bush administration a perfect mechanism for winning elections. They
declared an unending wear on terror. The frame of the War on Terror
presupposes that the populace should be terrified, and orange alerts and
other administration measures and rhetoric keep the "Terror" frame
active. Fear and uncertainty then naturally activate the Strict Father
frame in a majority of people, leading the electorate to see politics in
conservative terms.


Enter the Terminator


Enter The Terminator! -- the ultimate in strictness, the tough guy
extraordinaire. The world champion body-builder is the last word in
discipline. What better stereotype for strict father morality? That is
the reason that it was Arnold -- not just any celebrity like Jay Leno or
Rob Lowe or Barbra Streisand -- who could activate a strict stereotype
and with it conservative Republican values.


What is peculiar to California is Arnold and the culture of the movies.
But the same mechanism lay behind the Republican victories in the 2002
election -- and in elections around the country since the days of Ronald
Reagan -- but especially in the last decade when Republicans have
mastered the art form of activating the strict father image in the minds
of voters. Arnie's popularity has the same source as Bush's popularity
with the Nascar dads: identification with strict father values and
stereotypes. Moreover, Davis' inability to communicate strong
progressive values is hardly unique to him. Democrats nationwide have a
similar inability to effectively and strongly communicate their values
and evoke powerful progressive stereotypes.


In addition, Davis made the bad mistake of accepting the DLC's metaphor
of campaigning as marketing. In the DLC model, you look for a list of
particular issues that a majority of people, including those on left,
support. In the last congressional election it was prescription drugs,
social security, and a woman's right to choose. If necessary, you "move
to the right" -- adopt some right-wing values in hope of getting
"centrist" voters. Davis, for example, favored the death penalty, tough
sentencing, and supported the prison guards' union. It's a
self-defeating strategy. Conservatives have been winning elections
without moving to the left.


By presenting a laundry list of issues, Davis and other democrats fail
to present a moral vision -- a coherent identity with a powerful
cultural stereotype -- that defines the very identity of the voters they
are trying to reach. A list of issues is not a moral vision. Indeed,
many Democrats were livid that Arnold did not run on the issues. He
didn't need to. His very being activated the strict father model -- the
heart of the moral vision of conservative Republicans and the most
common response to fear and uncertainty.


In short, Arnold's victory is right in line with other conservative
Republican victories. Davis' defeat is right in line with other
Democratic defeats. Unless the Democrats realize this, they will not
learn the lesson of this election.


Right-Wing Power Grabs


And indeed, conservatives are busy trying to keep Democrats from
learning this lesson. There is an important frame we haven't mentioned
yet: The Right-Wing Power Grab frame. Davis used this at the beginning
of his campaign, and Clinton and the Democratic presidential candidates
who supported Davis echoed the frame. This frame does accurately
characterize many of the facts as we have discussed them. But Davis was
unable to communicate this frame effectively and it fell from public
sight. The day after the election it was one of the few frames not
mentioned by the mainstream media. It has been dropped by the Democrats
but kept alive by the Republicans, who are using it to taunt and
delegitimize Democrats. They are using the "Voter Revolt" frame to argue
that the "Right-Wing Power Grab" frame was inaccurate.


Here's how the argument goes. The Right-Wing Power Grab frame implicitly
accuses the Schwarzenegger campaign of deception, of failing to admit

Friends,
Q: Why a recall in CA?=20
A: Electoral College, 538 votes total; 270 votes wins the presidential =
election.  CA has 54 electoral votes.  Now is the time for the math =
teachers to jump up and shout, Holy S..., that's 20% of the total number =
of votes required to win the presidential election contained in 2% of =
the states!  (isn't 1/50th 2%? I wasn't a math teacher?)

The recall had nothing to do with is Davis a jerk or is CA in fiscal =
difficulty...it has to do with calculating a victory in the 2004 =
elections.  With a GOP chap/lady in the top seat, the GOP moves closer =
to being able to corner those 54 electoral votes in 2004.=20

By the way, for those of you who count, you should note that a president =
can be elected to office having won only 12 of the 50 states...talk =
about a double duty whammy.  The 24% of folks who vote (that's a fairly =
normal turnout in most states during a national election) in only 25% of =
the states (12/50ths) can dictate to the remaining  ones of us, most of =
whom didn't vote.=20

So, what can you do?
Vote, dummy!  And get all your friends out voting!  Stop the whining; =
stop the rallies and the meetings that rant and rave and bitch and =
complain or demonstrate, and get your asses out into the districts and =
vote, damn you, VOTE!!!
Alex
P.S. sorry for the rant; I'm a tad unhappy about the current political =
picture here at home.   =20

  Interesting, but I think that the recall was a lot simpler. If
  Schwarzenneger hadn't entered the campaign the recall probably =
wouldn't
  have succeeded, and if it had Bustamante would have won, tho neither =
Davis
  nor Bustamante were particularly attractive candidates. It was the =
action
  hero thing did it. The balance in the election was voters who had =
never
  bothered to register before and who thought the film character was the
  man--hence Arnie's constant reminders of his films in his political
  appearances.

  The Frame Around Arnold

  Viewed on October 15, 2003

  Newspaper and TV reporters require a story. Each story requires a =
frame.
  How was the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger framed? Here is a
  selection:


  Voter Revolt: Gray Davis was such a bad governor that the voters
  justifiably ousted him and voted in the representative of the other
  party.


  The Great Noncommunicator: Gray Davis governed as well as possible =
under
  the circumstances, but was so bad at communicating with the electorate
  that he could not communicate his real accomplishments, nor could he
  communicate the role of the Republicans in the state's problems. The
  public thought Davis was worse than he was and wanted a communicator, =
so
  they voted him out and chose an actor.


  Those Kooky Californians: People in California are so weird that they
  voted a politically inexperienced bodybuilder-actor into office to
  replace a governor they voted for just last year.


  The People Beat the Politicians: When the people win, politics as =
usual
  must lose (Schwarzenegger's acceptance speech).


  Just a Celebrity: People don't understand politics and just voted for =
a
  celebrity.


  Up By his Bootstraps: Coming here as an immigrant, Arnie worked and
  worked to become a champion body-builder, then a millionaire actor, =
and
  finally achieved his dream -- becoming governor.


  Framing was rampant in reporting in this election. Frames come with
  inferences, so each framing implies something different.


  The "Voter Revolt" frame legitimizes the recall. It assumes that Davis
  was incompetent or corrupt, that the voters correctly perceived this,
  that it outraged them, that they spontaneously, righteously, and
  overwhelmingly rose up and ousted him, replacing him with someone they
  knew to be more competent. Democracy was served and all is well. We
  should be happy about the result and things will be better.


  The "Great Noncommunicator" frame implies that the one and only =
problem
  was Gray Davis' inability to communicate. It assumes he was a =
competent
  governor and a responsible administrator with that single fatal flaw,
  that people want communication so badly that they recalled Davis =
because
  he couldn't communicate his achievements. The implication is that the
  recall and Schwarzenegger's election had nothing to do with anything
  outside California or anything broader, and that the problem just was
  Davis.


  The "Kooky Californians" frame says the recall was irrational, that
  Californians can't tell the movies from reality, that a move action =
hero
  can't govern a great state in trouble, that Arnie is a political
  incompetent and that chaos will ensue.


  The "People Beat the Politicians" frame is Schwarzenegger's attempt to
  impose his own frame. The context is that Arnold will have to deal =
with
  a majority Democratic legislature. This frame casts himself and the
  Republican politicians as "the people" and the Democrats as "politics =
as
  usual," which "the people" voted against.


  The "Just a Celebrity frame" implies that there was no partisan =
politics
  in this election and that any celebrity at all could just as well have
  won.


  The "Up by his Bootstraps" frame attributes Arnold's election
  principally to Arnold himself, especially to his hard work and =
ambition.
  Arnold got to be governor because he deserved it. He deserved it =
because
  he worked hard -- at body-building, acting, and campaigning.


  If there's going to be a news story, there's going to be a frame and
  each frame will have different inferences.


  Facts and Framing


  It is a general finding about frames that if a strongly held frame
  doesn't fit the facts, the facts will be ignored and the frame will be
  kept. The frames listed above don't do very well at fitting the facts =
--
  though each has a grain of truth. Let's look at the facts that each
  frame hides.


  Voter Revolt: This frame hides the national Republican effort over
  several years to make Davis look bad by hurting the California =
economy.
  It hides the fact that energy deregulation was brought in by =
Republican
  governor Pete Wilson. It ignores the fact that there was no real =
"energy
  crisis." It resulted from thievery by Enron and other heavy Bush
  contributors, thievery that was protected by the Federal Energy
  Regulatory Commission run by Bush appointees. The Bush administration
  looked the other way while California was being bilked and went to =
great
  lengths not to help California financially in any of the many ways the
  federal government can help. Arnold had had a meeting with Ken Lay and
  other energy executives in spring 2001 when Lay was promoting
  deregulation, but denies any complicity in the theft. Arnold is now
  promoting energy deregulation again.


  It also ignores the fact that California's Republican legislature also
  went out of its way to make Davis look bad, refusing to support
  reasonable measures for dealing with the budget problems. It ignores =
the
  fact that the recall petition was paid for by a wealthy conservative
  legislator and that signature gatherers were paid handsomely and that
  some signatures were from out of state, which is illegal. And it =
ignores
  the enormous amount of money and organization put into the
  Schwarzenegger campaign by Republicans. This was no simple popular
  revolution. Most of all, the "Voter Revolt" frame does not explain why
  Schwarzenegger should have been the candidate chosen.


  The Great Noncommunicator frame has a lot of truth to it. But it too
  hides all the sustained Republican effort, and it also hides the fact
  that it is not just Gray Davis, but rather Democrats in general, who
  cannot communicate effectively.


  The Kooky Californians frame does not explain any of the above. The
  Republicans' long-term, carefully structured anti-Davis campaign is
  hidden by this frame. It is as if there were no politics at work here =
at
  all.


  The People Beat the Politicians frame hides the fact that the
  Republicans have been playing politics with the state finances for =
years
  in an attempt to beat Davis. It hides the fact the Schwarzenegger team
  run by former governor Pete Wilson will be just as much "politics as
  usual," and that the Democratic representatives in the legislature
  numerically represent more of "the people" than do the Republicans.


  The Just a Celebrity frame ignores all the above political factors, =
and
  also cannot explain why this particular celebrity won. Jay Leno
  supported Arnold; Jay is just as much a celebrity, but Jay Leno could
  never have been elected governor.


  The Up by his Bootstraps frame also ignores all the politics involved
  and doesn't explain why other movie actors who pulled themselves up by
  their bootstraps didn't run and wouldn't have been elected.


  These framings hide other important facts as well. They don't explain
  why a lot of union rank-and-file members ignored their unions' support
  for Davis and voted for Arnold against their self-interest. They don't
  explain why a great many Hispanics voted for Arnold instead of
  Bustamante. They don't explain Arnold's popularity with women despite
  the revelations against him of sexist behavior.


  The Moral Politics Analysis


  I'm going to offer a very different account of the Schwarzenegger
  victory, based on my book 'Moral Politics.' Since the book was written
  in 1996 and updated in 2002, the account I'll be giving is a general
  one, based on a general understanding of American politics, not on the
  special facts about this election. My resulting claim is that much of
  what occurred in the recall election is the same as what has been =
going
  on for some time in American politics. The Schwarzenegger election, I
  propose, should not be seen as an entirely unique event, despite =
having
  unique elements, but rather part of the overall political landscape.


  In 'Moral Politics,' I suggested that voters vote their identity -- =
they
  vote on the basis of who they are, what values they have, and who and
  what they admire. A certain number of voters identify themselves with
  their self-interest and vote accordingly. But that is the exception
  rather than the rule. There are other forms of personal identification
  -- with one's ethnicity, with one's values, with cultural stereotypes,
  and with culture heroes. The most powerful forms of identification so
  far as elections are concerned are with values and corresponding
  cultural stereotypes. The Republicans have discovered this and it is a
  major reason why they have been winning elections -- despite being in =
a
  minority. Democrats have not yet figured this out.


  The 'Moral Politics' discovery is that models of idealized family
  structure lie at the heart of our politics -- less literally than
  metaphorically. The very notion of the founding fathers uses a =
metaphor
  of the nation as family, not as something we think actively about, but
  as way of structuring our understanding of the enormous
  hard-to-conceptualize social group, the nation, in terms of something
  closer to home, the family. It is something we do automatically, =
usually
  without consciously thinking about it.


  Our politics is organized around two opposite and idealized models of
  the family, the strict father and nurturant parent models.


  The nurturant parent family assumes that the world is basically good =
and
  can be made better and that it is one's responsibility to work towards
  that. Accordingly, children are born good and parents can make them
  better. Both parents share responsibility for raising the children.
  Their job is to nurture their children and raise their children to be
  nurturers. Nurturing has two aspects: empathy (feeling and caring how
  others feel) and responsibility to take care of oneself and others for
  whom we are responsible. These two aspects of nurturance imply family
  values that we can recognize as progressive political values: From
  empathy, we want for others: protection from harm, fulfillment in =
life,
  fairness, freedom (consistent with responsibility), open two-way
  communication. From responsibility there follows: competence, trust,
  commitment, community building, and so on.


   From these values, specific policies follow: Governmental protection =
in
  form of a social safety net and government regulation (as well as the
  military and the police), universal education (competence, fairness),
  civil liberties and equal treatment (fairness and freedom),
  accountability (from trust), public service (from responsibility), =
open
  government (from open communication), and the promotion of an economy
  that benefits all and functions to promote these values. The role of
  government is to provide the infrastructure and services to enact =
these
  values and taxes are the dues you pay to live in such a civilized
  society. In foreign policy, the role of the nation should be to =
promote
  cooperation and extend these values to the world. These are =
traditional
  progressive values in American politics.


  Different Family Values


  The conservative worldview is shaped by very different family values.


  The strict father model assumes that the world is and always will be
  dangerous and difficult and that children are born bad and must be =
made
  good. The strict father is the moral authority who has to support and
  defend the family, tell his wife what to do, and teach his kids right
  from wrong. The only way to do that is painful discipline -- physical
  punishment that is to develop by adulthood into internal discipline.
  Morality and survival jointly arise from such discipline -- discipline
  to follow moral precepts and discipline to pursue your self-interest =
to
  become self-reliant. The good people are the disciplined people. Once
  grown, the self-reliant disciplined children are on their own and the
  father is not to meddle in their lives. Those children who remain
  dependent (who were spoiled, overly willful, or recalcitrant) should =
be
  forced to undergo further discipline or cut free with no support to =
face
  the discipline of the outside world.


  Project this onto the nation and you have the radical right-wing
  politics that has been misnamed "conservative." The good citizens are
  the disciplined ones -- those who have already become wealthy or at
  least self-reliant -- and those who are on the way. Social programs
  "spoil" people, giving them things they haven't earned and keeping =
them
  dependent. They are therefore evil and to be eliminated. Government is
  there only to protect the nation, maintain order, administer justice
  (punishment), and to provide for the orderly conduct of and the
  promotion of business. Business (the market) is the mechanism by which
  the disciplined people become self-reliant, and wealth is a measure of
  discipline. Taxes beyond the minimum needed for such government are
  punishments that take away from the good, disciplined people rewards
  that they have earned and spend it on those who have not earned it.


  In foreign affairs, the government should maintain its sovereignty and
  impose its moral authority everywhere it can, while seeking its self
  interest (the economic self-interest of corporations and military
  strength).


  How We Vote


  Given these distinctions, there are the natural complications of real
  people. Such models are there in the synapses of our brains. When we
  vote on the basis of values and cultural stereotypes, what determines
  how we vote is which model is active for understanding politics at the
  time.


  We all have both models -- either actively or passively. Progressives
  who can understand an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie have at least a
  passive version of the strict father model alongside the active
  nurturant model that defines their politics. Conservatives who can
  understand the Bill Cosby show have at least a passive version of the
  nurturant model.


  But many people -- often enough to decide elections -- have active
  versions of both models that they use in different parts of their =
lives.
  There are strict fathers in the classroom who have progressive =
politics.
  There are strict fathers on the job who are nurturant parents at home.
  Many blue collar workers are strict fathers at home, but nurturant
  toward their co-workers. Union employees tend to be strict toward =
their
  employers and nurturant toward union members. Women tend to have =
active
  nurturant parent models, but a significant number accept the authority
  of the strict father, are strict mothers, or may have some significant
  fear. Fear triggers the strict father model; it tends to make the =
model
  active in one's brain.


  What conservatives have learned about winning elections is that they
  have to activate the strict father model in more than half of the
  electorate -- either by fear or by other means. The 9/11 attacks gave
  the Bush administration a perfect mechanism for winning elections. =
They
  declared an unending wear on terror. The frame of the War on Terror
  presupposes that the populace should be terrified, and orange alerts =
and
  other administration measures and rhetoric keep the "Terror" frame
  active. Fear and uncertainty then naturally activate the Strict Father
  frame in a majority of people, leading the electorate to see politics =
in
  conservative terms.


  Enter the Terminator


  Enter The Terminator! -- the ultimate in strictness, the tough guy
  extraordinaire. The world champion body-builder is the last word in
  discipline. What better stereotype for strict father morality? That is
  the reason that it was Arnold -- not just any celebrity like Jay Leno =
or
  Rob Lowe or Barbra Streisand -- who could activate a strict stereotype
  and with it conservative Republican values.


  What is peculiar to California is Arnold and the culture of the =
movies.
  But the same mechanism lay behind the Republican victories in the 2002
  election -- and in elections around the country since the days of =
Ronald
  Reagan -- but especially in the last decade when Republicans have
  mastered the art form of activating the strict father image in the =
minds
  of voters. Arnie's popularity has the same source as Bush's popularity
  with the Nascar dads: identification with strict father values and
  stereotypes. Moreover, Davis' inability to communicate strong
  progressive values is hardly unique to him. Democrats nationwide have =
a
  similar inability to effectively and strongly communicate their values
  and evoke powerful progressive stereotypes.


  In addition, Davis made the bad mistake of accepting the DLC's =
metaphor
  of campaigning as marketing. In the DLC model, you look for a list of
  particular issues that a majority of people, including those on left,
  support. In the last congressional election it was prescription drugs,
  social security, and a woman's right to choose. If necessary, you =
"move
  to the right" -- adopt some right-wing values in hope of getting
  "centrist" voters. Davis, for example, favored the death penalty, =
tough
  sentencing, and supported the prison guards' union. It's a
  self-defeating strategy. Conservatives have been winning elections
  without moving to the left.


  By presenting a laundry list of issues, Davis and other democrats fail
  to present a moral vision -- a coherent identity with a powerful
  cultural stereotype -- that defines the very identity of the voters =
they
  are trying to reach. A list of issues is not a moral vision. Indeed,
  many Democrats were livid that Arnold did not run on the issues. He
  didn't need to. His very being activated the strict father model -- =
the
  heart of the moral vision of conservative Republicans and the most
  common response to fear and uncertainty.


  In short, Arnold's victory is right in line with other conservative
  Republican victories. Davis' defeat is right in line with other
  Democratic defeats. Unless the Democrats realize this, they will not
  learn the lesson of this election.


  Right-Wing Power Grabs


  And indeed, conservatives are busy trying to keep Democrats from
  learning this lesson. There is an important frame we haven't mentioned
  yet: The Right-Wing Power Grab frame. Davis used this at the beginning
  of his campaign, and Clinton and the Democratic presidential =
candidates
  who supported Davis echoed the frame. This frame does accurately
  characterize many of the facts as we have discussed them. But Davis =
was
  unable to communicate this frame effectively and it fell from public
  sight. The day after the election it was one of the few frames not
  mentioned by the mainstream media. It has been dropped by the =
Democrats
  but kept alive by the Republicans, who are using it to taunt and
  delegitimize Democrats. They are using the "Voter Revolt" frame to =
argue
  that the "Right-Wing Power Grab" frame was inaccurate.


  Here's how the argument goes. The Right-Wing Power Grab frame =
implicitly
  accuses the Schwarzenegger campaign of deception, of failing to admit
  connections to Karl Rove and the national Republican apparatus and of
  misrepresenting the facts -- many of which we have discussed above. A
  "power grab" is illegitimate, using either illegal or immoral means to
  attain power. The Republicans manipulated the media using some of the
  frames we have discussed to hide facts and create false impressions.
   From the perspective of the facts we have discussed, the election =
does
  seem to fit the Right-Wing Power Grab frame.


  In the wake of the election, the Republicans have grabbed onto the
  Democrats' previous use of the Right-Wing Power Grab frame, arguing =
from
  the Voter Revolt interpretation of the election to claim that there =
was
  no power grab at all, that the election simply expressed the will of =
the
  voters. The very fact that Arnold got a strong plurality -- and near
  majority -- in the election is used as prima facie evidence that the
  Voter Revolt frame is the correct way to interpret the election. But =
as
  we have seen, that frame hides exactly the facts that the Right-Wing
  Power Grab frame illuminates.


  The Democrats ignore the power of framing at their peril.

Of course everyone should vote, but it's unlikely in any case that Bush
will carry California.

If you're interested in odd inequities, try this one: Wyoming with 500,000
people has two senators, same as California with 35 million. That means my
say in the senate is 1/70 of what it would be if I lived in Laramie. The
Republican senate majority represents 42% of the population. We're saddled
with a constitution framed for 18th century problems, and there's no
conceivable way to scrap it and start over.

>   accountability (from trust), public service (from responsibility), open
>   government (from open communication), and the promotion of an economy
>   that benefits all and functions to promote these values. The role of
>   government is to provide the infrastructure and services to enact these

>
>
>   Different Family Values
>
>
>   The conservative worldview is shaped by very different family values.
>
>
>   The strict father model assumes that the world is and always will be
>   dangerous and difficult and that children are born bad and must be made
>   good. The strict father is the moral authority who has to support and
>   defend the family, tell his wife what to do, and teach his kids right
>   from wrong. The only way to do that is painful discipline -- physical
>   punishment that is to develop by adulthood into internal discipline.
>   Morality and survival jointly arise from such discipline -- discipline
>   to follow moral precepts and discipline to pursue your self-interest to
>   become self-reliant. The good people are the disciplined people. Once
>   grown, the self-reliant disciplined children are on their own and the
>   father is not to meddle in their lives. Those children who remain
>   dependent (who were spoiled, overly willful, or recalcitrant) should be
>   forced to undergo further discipline or cut free with no support to face
>   the discipline of the outside world.
>
>
>   Project this onto the nation and you have the radical right-wing
>   politics that has been misnamed "conservative." The good citizens are
>   the disciplined ones -- those who have already become wealthy or at
>   least self-reliant -- and those who are on the way. Social programs
>   "spoil" people, giving them things they haven't earned and keeping them
>   dependent. They are therefore evil and to be eliminated. Government is
>   there only to protect the nation, maintain order, administer justice
>   (punishment), and to provide for the orderly conduct of and the
>   promotion of business. Business (the market) is the mechanism by which
>   the disciplined people become self-reliant, and wealth is a measure of
>   discipline. Taxes beyond the minimum needed for such government are
>   punishments that take away from the good, disciplined people rewards
>   that they have earned and spend it on those who have not earned it.
>
>
>   In foreign affairs, the government should maintain its sovereignty and
>   impose its moral authority everywhere it can, while seeking its self
>   interest (the economic self-interest of corporations and military
>   strength).
>
>
>   How We Vote
>
>
>   Given these distinctions, there are the natural complications of real
>   people. Such models are there in the synapses of our brains. When we
>   vote on the basis of values and cultural stereotypes, what determines
>   how we vote is which model is active for understanding politics at the
>   time.
>
>
>   We all have both models -- either actively or passively. Progressives
>   who can understand an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie have at least a
>   passive version of the strict father model alongside the active
>   nurturant model that defines their politics. Conservatives who can
>   understand the Bill Cosby show have at least a passive version of the
>   nurturant model.
>
>
>   But many people -- often enough to decide elections -- have active
>   versions of both models that they use in different parts of their lives.
>   There are strict fathers in the classroom who have progressive politics.
>   There are strict fathers on the job who are nurturant parents at home.
>   Many blue collar workers are strict fathers at home, but nurturant
>   toward their co-workers. Union employees tend to be strict toward their
>   employers and nurturant toward union members. Women tend to have active
>   nurturant parent models, but a significant number accept the authority
>   of the strict father, are strict mothers, or may have some significant
>   fear. Fear triggers the strict father model; it tends to make the model
>   active in one's brain.
>
>
>   What conservatives have learned about winning elections is that they
>   have to activate the strict father model in more than half of the
>   electorate -- either by fear or by other means. The 9/11 attacks gave
>   the Bush administration a perfect mechanism for winning elections. They
>   declared an unending wear on terror. The frame of the War on Terror
>   presupposes that the populace should be terrified, and orange alerts and
>   other administration measures and rhetoric keep the "Terror" frame
>   active. Fear and uncertainty then naturally activate the Strict Father
>   frame in a majority of people, leading the electorate to see politics in
>   conservative terms.
>
>
>   Enter the Terminator
>
>
>   Enter The Terminator! -- the ultimate in strictness, the tough guy
>   extraordinaire. The world champion body-builder is the last word in
>   discipline. What better stereotype for strict father morality? That is
>   the reason that it was Arnold -- not just any celebrity like Jay Leno or
>   Rob Lowe or Barbra Streisand -- who could activate a strict stereotype
>   and with it conservative Republican values.
>
>
>   What is peculiar to California is Arnold and the culture of the movies.
>   But the same mechanism lay behind the Republican victories in the 2002
>   election -- and in elections around the country since the days of Ronald
>   Reagan -- but especially in the last decade when Republicans have
>   mastered the art form of activating the strict father image in the minds
>   of voters. Arnie's popularity has the same source as Bush's popularity
>   with the Nascar dads: identification with strict father values and
>   stereotypes. Moreover, Davis' inability to communicate strong
>   progressive values is hardly unique to him. Democrats nationwide have a
>   similar inability to effectively and strongly communicate their values
>   and evoke powerful progressive stereotypes.
>
>
>   In addition, Davis made the bad mistake of accepting the DLC's metaphor
>   of campaigning as marketing. In the DLC model, you look for a list of
>   particular issues that a majority of people, including those on left,
>   support. In the last congressional election it was prescription drugs,
>   social security, and a woman's right to choose. If necessary, you "move
>   to the right" -- adopt some right-wing values in hope of getting
>   "centrist" voters. Davis, for example, favored the death penalty, tough
>   sentencing, and supported the prison guards' union. It's a
>   self-defeating strategy. Conservatives have been winning elections
>   without moving to the left.
>
>
>   By presenting a laundry list of issues, Davis and other democrats fail
>   to present a moral vision -- a coherent identity with a powerful
>   cultural stereotype -- that defines the very identity of the voters they
>   are trying to reach. A list of issues is not a moral vision. Indeed,
>   many Democrats were livid that Arnold did not run on the issues. He
>   didn't need to. His very being activated the strict father model -- the
>   heart of the moral vision of conservative Republicans and the most
>   common response to fear and uncertainty.
>
>
>   In short, Arnold's victory is right in line with other conservative
>   Republican victories. Davis' defeat is right in line with other
>   Democratic defeats. Unless the Democrats realize this, they will not
>   learn the lesson of this election.
>
>
>   Right-Wing Power Grabs
>
>
>   And indeed, conservatives are busy trying to keep Democrats from
>   learning this lesson. There is an important frame we haven't mentioned
>   yet: The Right-Wing Power Grab frame. Davis used this at the beginning
>   of his campaign, and Clinton and the Democratic presidential candidates
>   who supported Davis echoed the frame. This frame does accurately
>   characterize many of the facts as we have discussed them. But Davis was
>   unable to communicate this frame effectively and it fell from public
>   sight. The day after the election it was one of the few frames not
>   mentioned by the mainstream media. It has been dropped by the Democrats
>   but kept alive by the Republicans, who are using it to taunt and
>   delegitimize Democrats. They are using the "Voter Revolt" frame to argue
>   that the "Right-Wing Power Grab" frame was inaccurate.
>
>
>   Here's how the argument goes. The Right-Wing Power Grab frame implicitly
>   accuses the Schwarzenegger campaign of deception, of failing to admit
>   connections to Karl Rove and the national Republican apparatus and of
>   misrepresenting the facts -- many of which we have discussed above. A
>   "power grab" is illegitimate, using either illegal or immoral means to
>   attain power. The Republicans manipulated the media using some of the
>   frames we have discussed to hide facts and create false impressions.
>    From the perspective of the facts we have discussed, the election does
>   seem to fit the Right-Wing Power Grab frame.
>
>
>   In the wake of the election, the Republicans have grabbed onto the
>   Democrats' previous use of the Right-Wing Power Grab frame, arguing from
>   the Voter Revolt interpretation of the election to claim that there was
>   no power grab at all, that the election simply expressed the will of the
>   voters. The very fact that Arnold got a strong plurality -- and near
>   majority -- in the election is used as prima facie evidence that the
>   Voter Revolt frame is the correct way to interpret the election. But as
>   we have seen, that frame hides exactly the facts that the Right-Wing
>   Power Grab frame illuminates.
>
>
>   The Democrats ignore the power of framing at their peril.

Subject:      Re: Question re Poetry Citation and Copyright
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

When it comes to the interpretation of article 10 of the Berne
convention (http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo001en.htm ) which
deals with the right to quote, Stephen M. Stewart says the following
in his "International Copyright and Neighbouring Rights" (1983) about
the revision of the convention from 1971 as opposed to the revision
made in 1948:


     2. The quotation must be 'compatible with fair
     practice'. This leaves a great deal of discretion to
     the courts. However, (a) the length of the quotation
     itself, (the Brussels Act 1948 still said 'short
     extracts') (b) whether the size of the quotation is a
     large or a small part of the work quoted, (c) the size
     of the quotation in relation to the item in which it is
     used, are all criteria to be applied by the courts.

     3. The extent of the quotation must 'not exceed that
     justified by the purpose'. Thus a piece of literary
     criticism may justify long quotations, whereas a
     newspaper article may only justify much shorter ones.
     (Stewart, 1983, p. 124)

----


It might be interesting also to dwell upon a few historical views on
this matter. Showing by doing some might say, since I will do some
abundant quoting. In Copinger's "The Law of Copyright" from 1904 the
author discusses fair use and the quantity of quotation:

     Lord Cottenham, in the cases of Bramwell v. Halcomb
     (b), and Saunders v. Smith (c), adverting to this
     point, said: "When it comes to a question of quantity,
     it must be very vague. One writer might take all the
     vital part of another's book, though it might be but a
     small proportion of the book in quantity. It is not
     only quantity, but value, that is always looked to. It
     is useless to refer to any particular cases as to
     quantity." In short, we must often, in deciding
     questions of this sort, look to the nature and objects
     of the selections made, the quantity and value of the
     materials used, and the degree in which the use may
     prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or
     supersede the objects of the original work. Many mixed
     ingredients enter into the discussion of such
     questions. In some cases a considerable portion of the
     materials of the original work may be fused into
     another work, so as to be indistinguishable in the mass
     of the latter, which has other professed and obvious
     objects, and cannot fairly be treated as a piracy; or
     they may be inserted as a sort of distinct and mosaic
     work into the general texture of the second work, and
     constitute the peculiar excellence thereof, and then it
     may be a clear piracy. If a person should, under colour
     of publishing 'elegant extracts' of poetry, include
     all the best pieces at large of a favourite poet, whose
     volume was secured by copyright, it would be difficult
     to say why it was not an invasion of that right, since
     it might constitute the entire value of the volume. The
     case of Mawman v. Tegg (a) is to this purpose.
     There was no pretence in that case that all the
     articles of the encyclopaedia of the plaintiffs had
     been copied into that of the defendants; but large
     portions of the materials of the plaintifrs work had
     been copied. Lord Eldon, upon that occasion, held that
     there might be a piracy of a part of a work, which
     would entitle the plaintiffs to a full remedy and
     relief in equity. In prior cases he had affirmed
     the like doctrine. In Wilkins v. Aikin (b), he said,
     "There is no doubt that a man cannot, under the pretence
     of quotation, publish either the whole or a part of
     another's book, although he may use, what in all cases
     it is difficult to define, fair quotation."

     The character of the books may be looked at; for an
     author will be allowed greater freedom of quotation if
     he is writing a book of an entirely different character
     from that from which he quotes,  than if the books
     directly compete with  one another. This is well
     illustrated by the case of Bradbury  v. Hotten (c), one
     which is very near the line. There the publication
     complained of was ' The Man of his Time,' the object of
     which was to illustrate the career of Napoleon III. by
     caricatures taken from  leading English and foreign
     illustrated papers. Nine caricatures, with their
     original headings and  references, but much reduced in
     size, were copied from nine numbers of 'Punch,'
     comprised within  the period extending from 1849 to
     1867. It was declared that the selections had been
     taken for the  sole purpose of illustrating the career
     of Napoleon. While admitting that limited extracts
     might be  taken from copyright works for a fair purpose
     of this kind, the court found that the defendant had
     republished the caricatures in 'Punch' for the same
     purpose as they were originally published,  namely, to
     excite the amusement of his readers. It was held that
     the defendant had gone beyond the  privilege of fair
     quotation, and therefore a case of piracy was made out.
     (Copinger, 1904, pp. 156-157.)


Copinger has this on extracts specifically made for critical purposes:


     Many cases of extracts for criticism have come before
     the court. It is obvious that quotations to some extent
     must in such cases be made from the work reviewed, and
     this abstract right of the reviewer has never been
     impeached. To deny this privilege would be, as Lord
     Kinloch once said, "to sentence to death all our
     reviews, and the greater part of our works in
     philosophy." The reviewer may make extracts sufficient
     to show the merits or demerits of the work, but not to
     such an extent as that the review may serve as a
     substitute for the book reviewed. Sufficient may be
     taken to give a correct view of the whole, but the
     privilege of making extracts is limited to these
     objects, and no person will be allowed to republish in
     the form of quotations a valuable part of the protected
     work and thus to an injurious extent to supersede the
     original (b).

     Whether the limits of lawful quotation have been
     exceeded is a question to be governed by the particular
     circumstances of each case.

     In a case in which the work alleged to be
     pirated was a play extending over forty pages, and the
     defendant had published a journal of theatrical
     criticism in which, as illustrative of his critical
     remarks, he had introduced broken and detached
     fragments of the piece in question, amounting in the
     whole to six or seven pages, some weight appears to
     have been allowed by the court to the fact of the
     extent of the extracts being so inconsiderable, as
     affording ground for doubt whether the defendant had
     transgressed the limits of fair quotation (a).
     (Copinger, 1904, pp 159-160)



Copinger also accounts for a case, Campbell v. Scott (1842) where
Scott had published a "Book of the Poets":


     Where the defendant had published a 'Book of the
     Poets,' with the object of illustrating the
     characteristics of various poets, and the progress of
     English poetry during the nineteenth century, the work
     was held to be piratical. The defendant had made 425
     selections and extracts, from forty-three poets, and
     they were employed to illustrate an original essay of
     thirty-four pages on English poetry of the period
     covered, twenty-three biographical sketches of one page
     each, and twenty shorter notices of authors. Besides
     extracts, six poems - in all of which the copyright was
     still subsisting - were taken in their entirety from
     Campbell's works. "If," said Vice-Chancellor Shadwell,
     "there were critical notes appended to each separate
     passage, or to several of the passages in succession
     which might illustrate them, and show from whence Mr.
     Campbell had borrowed an idea, or what idea he had
     communicated to others, I could understand that to be
     a fair criticism. But there is, first of all, a general
     essay, then there follows a mass of pirated matters,
     which in fact constitutes the value of the volume" (a).
     (Copinger, 1904, p 164)

According to the U.S. Copyright Office
(http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html):

"Under the fair use doctrine of the U.S. copyright statute, it is
permissible to use limited portions of a work including quotes, for
purposes such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, and scholarly
reports. There are no legal rules permitting the use of a specific number
of words, a certain number of musical notes, or percentage of a work.
Whether a particular use qualifies as fair use depends on all the
circumstances. See FL 102, Fair Use, and Circular 21, Reproductions of
Copyrighted Works by Educators and Librarians."

Here's a link to the Fair Use Doctrine:

http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html

This will point you to the section (107) of the copyright law which codifies
Fair Use, which says

"Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a
copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords
or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as
criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for
classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright."

Section 106 lists the rights of the copyright holder to do things to the work
he holds copyright for. Section 106a, "Rights of certain authors to attribution
and integrity," covers the visual arts.

So according to copyright law, if I (not a lawyer) interpret it correctly, you
can excerpt whatever the hell you want in a critical essay.

Does anyone (besides Kirby) have experience with paying for permissions?

Ripped from the vault they ciphered for the Hipocalyspe Now.
This for the cracked loafs of wasted youth. This for the disabled
hunting for condos made from cardboard boxes. This was the payback for
hemp wrapped bodies floating in the ocean. Water holding a likkle girl
cut to shreds with oxes
This is for Ian Hunter the victim of wicked collusion.

Inna tangle wiph beat cops
Pretty view East of Vancouver
Far from Eden
Caught on camera
A message to deliver
Pagers go off sounding an alarm
"We comin to do you harm"
At airports terminating the
System of down pressing
News captured in sculptures of Dawson
Escaping to foreign Lands
Developin cells
Another brutha fell
Tricks with handcuffs and gun shots
My compadre in the agony of Griffith
Cap a metal seal in his knot meat
Memories fill Anthony with our defeat
Our Elder’s
Striped bare on a beach
Where is this road
What leads to Dallas
Tell us
Filmic feet loaded to speak
Buried in sleet
50 to 60
All the buried girls lined up unpretty
Contemplating just one day of …
Peace

If we now adjust the opressed and make it a class issue and not just a
race issue of todays peoples then we have same situation and solution
which Malik stated.

Malcolm X and his "by any means necessary" quote: They called me 'a
teacher, a fomentor of violence.' I would say point blank, 'That is a
lie. I'm not for wanton violence, I'm for justice. I feel that if white
people were attacked by Negroes-if the forces of law prove unable, or
inadequate, or reluctant to protect those whites from those Negroes-then
those white people should protect and defend themselves from those
Negroes, using arms if necessary. And I feel that when the law fails to
protect Negroes from whites' attack then those Negroes should use arms,
if necessary, to defend themselves.'...'I am speaking against and my
fight is against white racists. I firmly believe that Negroes have the
right to fight against these racists, by any means that are necessary.'

Nose to the ground 'concretist'. Great combinations of found visuals

Nine Lives--Small Press Traffic's 9th Annual Literary Soiree & Auction
Saturday, November 8, 2003, from 3-8 p.m.
California College of Arts (CCA)
1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the intersection of 16th &
Wisconsin)
email: smallpress@ccac-art.edu
415-551-9278

Over the past years our auctions have been enlivened by the appearance of all
kinds of extraordinary one of a kind items. Zadie Smith, the UK author of
WHITE TEETH, autographed a tube of toothpaste for us. Gore Vidal sent us his
proof copy of his New Yorker article on Monica Lewinsky, while Don DeLillo
sent a manuscript page from MAO II. Anonymous art activists raided Michael
Ondaatje's waste paper basket, and we sold his trash--an action that got us
dubious press in the New York Times. Last year reclusive wunderkind JT Leroy
let us auction off his corrected version of METEORS,--and on and on. This
year, Pulitzer Prize winning writer Michael Cunningham pried the face off a
travel alarm, and signed it with THE HOURS, while Irish novelist Jamie O'Neill
(AT SWIM, TWO BOYS) made a St Patrick's Day T-shirt that will bring tears to
your eyes--all to help us raise money for San Francisco's premier avant-garde
poetry showcase.

$10 admission for a full day of

SURVIVING, THRIVING and JIVING at NINE LIVES

It's our ninth annual soiree event and what better trope to employ in the copy
than the nine lives of the cat? We're an organization that lives like a cat,
on kindness, dexterity and dumb luck, but we reward you with so much
affection!

Food * Music * Cash Bar--featuring the Meow Mix cocktail! * Celebrity
Appearances * Raffle for Fabulous Prizes * Poet's Theater * Presentation of
SPT's 2nd annual Book Awards, the best books of poetry published all of last
year . . . and our 2003 Lifetime Achievement Award goes to Barbara Guest

OUR BIG ANNUAL AUCTION OF LITERARY MANUSCRIPTS, MEMENTOS, AUTOGRAPHS, SIGNED
BROADSIDES, LETTERS, PHOTOS, ARTWORK AND EPHEMERA
You'll claw your way to the front. Highlights of this year's CAT-alogue
include:

* Michael Cunningham, alarm clock, yes, alarm clock signed by the author of
THE HOURS for our auction

WORLD PREMIERE OF "THE SMITH FAMILY,"
A NEW PLAY BY CRAIG GOODMAN AND KEVIN KILLIAN
A tornado's heading toward Fort Smith, Arkansas, where the Smith family is
hosting their annual reunion. Barometer's falling, pressure's mounting, Jack
Smith is up on the roof filming "Flaming Creatures," Wayne Smith torn between
his devotion to his wife Liz Smith and her sister, former Angel Jaclyn Smith.
Patti Smith conducts a secret Romeo and Juliet affair with one of the Jones
family (Tommy Lee), while Anna Nicole Smith struggles with demons of her own.
Kiki Smith has made a 500-ton vagina for the Venice Biennale, while Will Smith
ponders his floundering career. Meanwhile an interloper's moving on in, and
the ghost of tall, elegant Alexis Smith prowls the plantation with her
spectral dog. Susan Smith looks at her two kids in the back seat and then
looks at the lake and then--As Morrissey (from the Smiths) croons in the
background, Heaven knows we're miserable now. When you've got a big family,
who's to blame for all the problems of the world? With Taylor Brady, Anne
Collier, Gerald Corbin, Margaret Crane, Kota Ezawa, Tanya Hollis, Kevin
Killian, John Koch, Karla Milosevich, Yedda Morrison, Rex Ray, Laurie Reid,
Jocelyn Saidenberg and Wayne Smith (as himself).

Aaron,  This is a useful start on the copyright question, but even in the link that
you provide it states clearly:

"The distinction between 'fair use' and infringement may be unclear and not easily
defined.  There is no specific numbre of words, lines, or notes that may be safely
taken without permission.  Acknowledging the source of the copyrighted material
does NOT substitute for obtaining permission."

So, what happens if a graduate student works for five years on a poet and the poet
then decides he or she doesn't like what has been written and decided to deny
permission?  The graduate student is completely fucked.

Your link then goes on to say,

"The safest course is always to get permission from the copyright holder before
using copyrighted material."

Because of the notorious Yvor Winters case, the murkiness of fair use within poetry
is incredibly uncertain -- "uncertain and not easily defined" -- as your link puts
it.

Poets can and have charged exorbitant fees, or denied permission altogether, to
reprint any or all of their work.

I would really love it if someone was to prove that all this was some kind of
mirage that I myself have invented.  Meanwhile, I offer this caveat to young
critics -- get permission, or you may end up with an unpublishable book, and there
goes your chance at tenure.  There are so few jobs in contemporary poetry for
critics (I think there were three or four posted this year -- out of the over one
thousand jobs posted at MLA this year) that to land such a position and then mess
up getting tenure by having forgotten to get copyright permission so that you are
back in the temporary secretarial pool -- well, don't say I didn't warn you.

Poets have not much else, but they do have tremendous control over their oeuvre.

Spring Poetry Series at Carr Haus, Rhode Island School of Design, though
I'm not doing it in 2004.  Another one of my favorite venues is wherever

Given the lively discussion on the list recently of copyright law and its
effects, some
of you might be interested in the following conference, which will address
many of
these issues in literary publishing and other areas, including music and the
visual
arts. I'd especially urge people to get together and construct panels
addressing these
issues in the world of poetry and poetics.

Mark Scroggins

CALL FOR PAPERS

Battling for Ownership:  Who Controls Music, Film, Publishing, and Visual
Communications?

First Bi-Annual Conference, April 16-18, 2004
Boca Raton Marriott in Boca Raton, FL

Host:  Dorothy F. Schmidt, College of Arts and Letters, Florida Atlantic
University
Conference Committee:  Michael Zager, Jeffrey Galin, Anthony Tamburri, Robert
Davis, Heather Coltman, Angel DiCosola, Jean-Louis Baldet, Susan Reilley, Mark
Scroggins, Eric Freedman

We invite abstracts for 20 minute presentations and complete panel and
roundtable
proposals on all aspects of intellectual property in music, film, publishing,
and visual
communications.  We especially encourage those that address issues across the
commercial arts and/or their impact on the public good.  We offer the
following
questions as areas of particular interest:

=95=09What industry-specific intellectual property problems have cross-industry
implications and how might solutions to these problems affect the industries
and
their consumers?

=95=09How are music, film, publishing, and visual communications industries
addressing the conflicts between corporate rights to protect assets and public
rights
to fair-use and advancement of the public good?

=95=09How do specific cases like the RIAA=92s suits against peer-to-peer music
traders,
Jon Johansen (developer of DVD decoding software), Kinko's (copying course
packets
for university students) affect copyright holders, legal doctrine, and
cultural practices?

=95=09How should the industries that deal in the arts change as a result of new
digital
technologies, user habits and expectations, and the balance that must be
maintained
between encouraging creativity by giving exclusive property rights in
creations and
fostering a competitive market place by giving the freest possible public
access to
works of authorship and the ideas they encompass?  For example, how will
industries
like music continue to change in response to the changing roles of
intellectual
property online? Will most music be sold online, and if so how will illicit
music trading
be stopped?

=95=09In the first weeks of 2003 the Supreme Course upheld the Sonny Bono Act's
twenty year extension of the 1976 Copyright Law, and the recording and
technology
industries reached a "landmark agreement" to address piracy concerns, meet
consumer expectations, and forestall government regulation of digital
copyrights.
How will such decisions affect the future of copyright and cultural
production/
exchange?  What implications will such national decisions have on global
markets and
cultures?

Invited speakers will include:

Rosemary Coombe, Tier One Canada Research Chair in Law, Communication and
Cultural Studies at York University in Toronto; Daphne Ireland, Intellectual
Property
Manager at Princeton University Press and Chair of the Copyright Committee for
the

Copyright Management, and Director of the Copyright Management Center at
IUPUI;
Jenny Toomey, Executive Director Future of Music Coalition; Robert Spoo,
Copyrights
Editor for the Journal of Modern  Literature and the  James Joyce Quarterly
and a
member of the intellectual property  group at the law firm of Doerner,

my grad seminar (PhD + MFA students) is reading N/O for next week.

I'm suggesting students access the thread on the book here on POETICS (from
late spring / early summer, right?).  But aside from that:

good stuff written on N/O?

best stuff written on Ron's work in general (or about some other particular
work but w more general applicability)?

Ron: would be curious if you'd recommend anything in particular.

thanks,

I almost forgot. This is not brand new but could possibly be of

first saw this German TV series been a great fan. Unfortunately I
have no access to video copies, otherwise I would probably join the

In chicago the best reading series is the Discrete Series-- it must be the
best since I read there:) , but seriously it is quite good with real
diversity of serious writers in a great space to hear poetry--
 also the Danny's Series is good but it is a bar hence it is less
comfortable than the Discrete series.
The Chicago Poetry Project does a reading series at the Harold Washington
Library which is very good ( the lady from Skanky Possom read last month)
but it is on Saturday afternoons which can be tough to get to.

Levy, Locklin, Lifshin, Bukowski, underground press.

The world of underground, small press poetry continues to flourish. It has
its own set of superstars and its own cannon. With its own poetics and
regulations it proliferates and it's often dismissed without consideration.
Nevertheless, it supports itself and has its poets have a readership,
sometimes so large as to be unequaled anywhere else in poetry. What's going
on? CALL FOR PAPERS. Poetry Studies Area. Popular Culture Association
/American Culture Association, PCA/ACA Conference, San Antonio, TX April
7-10, 2004.

The Poetry Studies Area of the Popular Culture Conference is interested in
paper abstracts on poets who have links to popular culture, past or
present. Also, we are very interested in panel proposals. Poetry and
Popular Culture is a vast undefined and open area. Your definition of
Poetry and Popular Culture will be respected. Complete and detailed
information can be located at: http://www.h-net.org/~pcaaca/2004/

If interested please send a brief paper abstract. Deadline is November 15,
2003. Send proposals for panels and abstracts to:

Michael Basinski, Associate Curator, The Poetry/Rare Books Collection, 420
Capen Hall, SUNY at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York 14260

Please include your current addresses, phone number and email. All accepted
proposals will be furnished with further information concerning conference
registration, hotel accommodations and other pertinent information.

Clashes in Iraq -- not Vietnam yet, but getting warm

Hamilton Spectator
Oct. 10, 2003

Gwynne Dyer

The six-month anniversary of the fall of Baghdad on Oct. 8 was one of the
worst days yet for the occupation forces in Iraq. An attack on a U.S.
road convoy killed at least one American soldier, which is the sort of
thing that happens most days. But a Spanish diplomat was also
assassinated in Baghdad (the Spanish government backed the invasion of
Iraq), and a suicide bomber killed eight Iraqi policemen who were
collaborating with the occupiers in the courtyard of their own police
station. Not Vietnam yet, but getting warm.

Add the failure of thousands of inspectors to find Saddam Hussein's
alleged weapons of mass destruction and the Bush administration's request
for another $87 billion to cover the cost of Iraq and Afghanistan, and
it's hardly surprising that Bush's approval ratings with Americans are
falling steeply.

It begins to look possible that the entire neoconservative project for
imposing a unilateral "pax americana" on the world may be rejected by
voters in the November 2004 election. Iraq will remain a mess for a long
time, but maybe we will soon get back to the old world of multilateralism
and the UN.

That's the hope many people are starting to nourish, but it may not be
that simple. There is now a symbiotic relationship between the Islamist
terrorists and the neoconservative directors of the "war on terror" that
promises a long political life to the players on both sides.

Both seek to undermine the existing global order in order to expand their
own freedom of action. Each group's actions justify the existence of the
other group, at least in the eyes of its own supporters.

Al-Qaeda sees the overseas adventures of American neo-conservatives as
the best possible recruiting tool for its own cause among Muslims
worldwide. If Osama bin Laden could decide the next U.S. presidential
election, he would instantly choose President George W. Bush. A rival
candidate might pull American troops out of the Middle East or be more
even-handed in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, and bin Laden has no
interest in regional stability.

Given that bin Laden does not have a magic wand, what is Bush's best hope
of winning a second term despite an ailing economy and the deepening
quagmire of Iraq?

It is that Americans close ranks patriotically behind him as they did in
the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11. He needs either another major
terrorist attack on American soil, or another victorious war against an
alleged "terrorist state" or a suspected proliferator of "weapons of mass
destruction."

Nobody in the Bush entourage would actively wish for a new terrorist
outrage in the U.S., but they must know it might happen anyway, and it
would likely stampede American voters back into the arms of their man.
But they must also know it might not happen, so they must consider what
they could do to improve Bush's electoral fate.

Put so baldly, this sounds desperately cynical. Would patriotic Americans
in senior positions in the Bush administration really engineer a war in
which young Americans would be killed just for the sake of their man's
re-election?

No, probably not. But senior members of the administration have a short
list of "rogue" countries that they would like to attack anyway, for
reasons that seem to them as sound as the ones that moved them to invade
Iraq. Their assessment of the threat level from these places, and of the
urgency with which the U.S. should act against them, will take place in
one compartment of minds where another compartment is simultaneously
contemplating the awful tragedy of a defeat in November 2004 that would,
in their view, leave the U.S. horribly exposed and vulnerable.

We are not out of the woods.

There may well be another terrorist attack before the vote, or another
war. If either, the impasse between Islamists and neo-cons will challenge
the global order that has been painfully built up since 1945.

I like the readings I do for myself--sometimes aloud,
sometimes very quietly, my lips barely moving, someone's
voice whispering, at times roaring, in my ear.

My favorite venues are the desk where I sit in my
little office, a comfortable chair in the living room,
my bed upstairs, just before I fall asleep.

Yeah, keep the bill of rights and the fourteenth amendment, the supreme
court, the division of powers between the houses of congress. Maybe a few
other things. But--scrap the current state boundaries, add a mechanism for
reviewing same at reasonable intervals. And change the house of
representatives to a parliament (out of which the president), so that many
parties and viewpoints could be represented and be forced to form
coalitions to govern.

One could conceive of a revolution, but it wouldn't be feasible.

"THE ARMY BE THUGGING IT"

The military is teaming up with hip-hop bible the Source to recruit
black urban kids with pimped-out Hummers and off-da-hook merchandise.

- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Whitney Joiner



Oct. 17, 2003  |  Three times a week, 48 weeks a year, a four-man team
drives a huge yellow Hummer to a different location. It might be a
college or high school campus, a major fraternity gathering, an NAACP
event, MTV's Spring Break, or BET's Spring Bling: If lots of
African-American teens will be there, the Hummer wants to be there, too.

Spray-painted with patriotic images (a rippling American flag, a
smiling white woman in a U.S. military officer's uniform), the yellow
Hummer
is the signature vehicle for the U.S. Army's "Taking It to the Streets"
campaign, a hip-hop-flavored tour launched a year ago by Vital
Marketing Group, the Army's African-American events marketing team.
During
these events, the Taking It to the Streets team lets possible recruits
hang
out in the Hummer, where they can try out the multimedia sound system
or watch Army recruitment videos. The Army's team often throws contests,

too: Which possible recruit can shoot the most baskets, do the most
push-ups, go up the rock-climbing wall the fastest? The winners are
awarded Army-branded trucker hats, throwback jerseys, wristbands and
headbands. Want a customized dog tag? They've got a machine that makes
them.
Want to see what it's like to fly a plane? There's a flight simulator.

It's all to convince urban teens that the Army understands hip-hop
culture: The Army knows you play basketball and wear jerseys, because
the
Army is down with the streets.

"You have to go where the target audience is," says Col. Thomas
Nickerson, director of strategic outreach for the U.S. Army Accessions
Command, who says that the Army just reached its recruitment goal of
100,200
enlistees this year. "Our research tells us that hip-hop and urban
culture is a powerful influence in the lives of young Americans. We try
to
develop a bond with that audience. I want them to say, 'Hey, the Army
was here -- the Army is cool!'"

But critics say that the Army's co-optation of hip-hop in its
streetwise campaign is misleading, because it markets a life-changing
and
possibly life-threatening commitment as a fun, cool consumer choice. And

some, like Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), who argued for a reinstatement
of
the draft in January, voice concerns about the overrepresentation of
people of color in the Army.

"One of the reasons why I advocated the draft is because, in terms of a
national crisis, we should have shared sacrifices," Rangel says. "When
the government says we have to stay in Iraq, we have to show that we're
prepared to lose lives, the 'we' should be a broad cross-section of
America. They're not asking all of America: They've targeted those
Americans who are not getting a fair shake in our society."

African-Americans and Hispanics are consistently overrepresented in the
armed forces. Even though the numbers have evened out a bit this year,
the 2003 Army is 16 percent black, compared with 11 percent of the
country, and 13.4 percent Latino, compared with 11 percent of the
country.

The Vital Marketing Group is about to take its recruitment campaign for
African-Americans a step further by teaming up with hip-hop bible the
Source. This fall, Vital will launch a new tour separate from the Taking

It to the Streets campaign: The Source Campus Combat Tour will start in
late October, hitting five Northeastern college campuses with high
percentages of African-American students. Like Taking It to the Streets,

the Campus Combat Tour will feature interactive exhibits and physical
challenges, but Campus Combat culminates in a grand MC battle judged by
the Source's editors.

"When I saw the Source was teaming up with the Army, I was outraged,"
says Bakari Kitwana, former executive editor of the Source and author of

"The Hip-Hop Generation: Young Blacks and the Crisis in
African-American Culture." "It's a betrayal of their readership. The
military has
historically used African-Americans, while the country has not done
justice
to African-Americans."

Niche marketing to minorities is a recent development for the Army. Two
years ago, the Army's newly hired advertising agency, Leo Burnett,
threw out the stale 20-year-old "Be All You Can Be" tagline and replaced

it
with a jazzy new campaign called "Army of One." This heavily researched
and focus-grouped motto -- emphasizing the Army's recognition of each
soldier's individual talents -- and its accompanying advertising blitz
are especially geared toward the short attention spans of the 72 million

Generation Yers. "It's becoming really difficult to establish brand
loyalty, because kids are bombarded with multiple messages," says Joseph

Anthony, CEO of Vital. (According to American Demographics magazine, the

average teen takes in 3,000 marketing messages a day.)

To compete with all the other brands vying for kids' attention, the
Army launched a dynamic, interactive Web site with a strong
cyberrecruiting team, multilingual chat rooms, a downloadable "America's

Army:
Operations" video game, and new commercials focused on Army skills that
easily translate to civilian life. And there are Army of One campaigns
tailored to specific groups. Muse Cordero Chin, the Los Angeles-based
agency
that heads up the African-American-geared ad campaign for Leo Burnett,
will roll out print and TV ads predominantly featuring blacks early
next year. (Muse works closely with Vital, which creates and markets the

campaign's events.) San Antonio's Cartel Creativo has developed Spanish
and English ads featuring Latin music for the Hispanic community. And
for the past year the Army has sponsored a NASCAR car and recruited at
races; the mostly white, rural NASCAR audience has already generated
over 40,000 leads for the Army.


Companies discovered a long time ago that utilizing hip-hop culture --
the musicians, the clothing, the lifestyle, the accoutrements -- is the
ticket to selling products to teenagers. Sprite's sales skyrocketed
after it launched its "Obey Your Thirst" campaign geared to urban youth.

When Tommy Hilfiger's clothes became popular with rappers, his sales
shot into the billion-dollar range. McDonald's just signed Justin
Timberlake, the poster boy of white soul, to do a hip-hop jingle,
produced by
the superstar duo the Neptunes. While most hip-hop advertising is an
attempt to attract both those who live the hip-hop lifestyle and those
who
just covet it -- the Army is specifically targeting black youth with
their new Source-sanctioned campaign. Since everyone else is marketing
with hip-hop -- and since it works -- why shouldn't the Army?

A majority of African-American kids are hip-hop fans, so marketing with
hip-hop just makes good business sense, says Vital's Anthony. "[This
campaign says] 'We want to come to your environment instead of trying to

get you to come to ours,'" he says. "The Army wants to better
understand your community." (It helps that all of Vital's employees are
young
and black, Anthony says. "The African-American market is more responsive

to marketing that's communicated to them through people who look like
them. There's more of a trust factor there.")

Everything about the campaign, down to the headbands and Army jerseys,
should send that message. "Those are big fashion statements in the
urban community right now, but before [Vital] was involved, those types
of
premiums didn't exist," says Anthony. "We're trying to make the Army
more relevant and utilize more of these trends. If we make Army apparel
a
part of their wardrobe, it just creates a connection. They're able to
see the brand in a different light, as cool."

Vital has big plans for the partnership with the Source. It doesn't
stop with the Campus Combat Tour: Vital hopes to use the
488,000-circulation subscription list for direct-marketing campaigns,
create some
cross-branded Web sites, throw more Source-branded events, and possibly
even
appear in the editorial content of the magazine; eventually, there may
be reader contests in which the winners will appear in the Source.

Right now, the partnership is in a test period, says Anthony, to "see
how the relationship bears fruit," but both the Army and the Source say
they hope to expand the tour next year. And Vital wants to partner with
other "urban platforms," like Vibe magazine and BET -- albeit
cautiously. "We don't want to come out of the gate seeming as if we're
trying to
buy our way into urban culture," Anthony says, "and we don't want our
media partner to be perceived as if they're selling out for money."

But what if that happens? "We've just got to try and position this as a
monumental shift in the U.S. Army's ideology in approaching urban
youth," he says.

Besides the Source tour in the Northeast and the nationwide Taking It
to the Streets campaign, Vital produces another recruitment tool for the

Army, a comedy tour that travels to historically black colleges in the
Southeast. But Campus Combat is the only tour with another well-known
and respected brand attached. And that's critical: It's not easy to
convince a bunch of African-American teens that the Army might be their
best career choice, but with the Source, the oldest and best-known
hip-hop
magazine, behind it, the Army gains some much-needed street cred.

"It gets us access," says Col. Nickerson, of the Army-Source
partnership.

It makes sense that the Army's looking to hip-hop to attract urban
youth, says Craig Werner, a professor of Afro-American Studies at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison. "They know that to sell themselves they

need to plug in with the culture," he says. "The Army has been the most
egalitarian institution in the U.S., bar none, since the desegregation
during the Korean War. If an African-American kid is looking for a
career
in which talent and character will be rewarded, there's no better place
than the Army. Having said that, I find the whole thing pretty
disgusting. It's an attempt to capitalize on desperation. We've created
a job
market in which [young African-Americans] don't have a damn chance."

The overrepresentation of minorities in the Army is often cited as
proof of the continuing struggle for people of color in the mainstream
economy. The Army needs to target ethnic groups, says Kendall Martin,
account supervisor at Muse Cordero Chen, because it needs to "mirror"
the
country. "The Army wants to make sure it improves on representing all
groups," he says. "The Army wants to look like America."

But the Army doesn't really look like America, and with a volunteer
service, it never will. And considering that one of the Army's main
draws
is money for college, it's definitely not economically diverse; kids
who don't need those incentives aren't as enticed to enlist.

"If you're a middle-class black kid, you're not enlisting, any more
than any middle-class white kid is enlisting," Werner says. "The Army
has
nothing to do with the general profile of American culture. It's lower
middle class, disproportionately black and brown, and
disproportionately Southern and rural."

Nickerson says he doesn't have any information on the socioeconomic
demographics of the Army's enlisted men. "We don't focus on economic
backgrounds," he says. "If you qualify to join the Army, I don't care
what
your economic or social status is."

Since the campaigns tailored to minorities were launched only this past
year, it's too soon to measure their impact. But the Army has hit its
quota of enlistees -- before deadline -- three years in a row.

"I think you underestimate the commitment of young Americans,"
Nickerson says, when I ask how the Army can possibly hit its numbers
given the
combative state of global affairs. (After all, you've got to wonder if
the flashy ad campaigns and free headbands will keep recruitment
numbers up as the body count in Iraq continues to rise.) "We've got the
best
recruiting force in the world. We've got a soft economy, and we've got
opportunities that resonate with young Americans."

For people of color, the economy's slide has been especially hard: Last
month's census data saw poverty numbers rising for all Americans, but
especially for blacks. A quarter of African-Americans are living in
poverty.

It's one of the reasons why the Army-Source campaign infuriates
Kitwana. "The Army is providing jobs, and I think that is a good thing,
but we
have to put that in context: Why does our country not have jobs for
young people?" he asks, pointing out that unemployment rates for black
youth are twice the rates for whites.

"One of the things that [African-Americans in the Army] complain about
is that we're over here helping these people, and that's all good, but
when we come back home, the hood is fucked up," says Kitwana, who
researched the military's economic effect on young African-Americans for

"The Hip-Hop Generation." "We can be using this same energy to get drugs

out of our community, to redevelop the economic infrastructure. It feels

empty, as important as it is, to know that we're going back home to
that."

"Look at it as the Army returning to that community a better person and
a leader in that community," counters Nickerson. "Young Americans who
join the Army leave the Army a better person."

Chris White, the Source's vice president of corporate sales, says
there's nothing to criticize about its partnership with the Army. The
Source
is just helping an important Source advertiser get its message out to
kids. "The Army has made a very strong advertising commitment for the
year," he says, adding that these days, advertisers are more interested
in marketing partnerships, like the Army-Source deal, than just buying
ad pages. "Clients want more than just an ad page in a magazine," White
says. "This is our first foray into doing cool marketing programs with
the Army, and it's our hope that it leads to a bigger relationship."
(Calls to the Source's editorial staff were not returned.)

The Nappy Roots, one of this year's most popular hip-hop groups who
traveled to the Middle East this summer on the USO tour, don't see a
problem with the use of hip-hop in the Army's campaigns. "I think a lot
of
poor folks go into the service because that's the only way out for a
better education, better jobs, and seeing the world," says the Nappy
Roots' Big V. "It's their only way to travel. Everybody can't be a
musician
or a successful doctor or lawyer."

Some young people in the Army's target demographic agree: "The Army
gives young people opportunities, especially urban people," says
Sterling
Canter, 23, of Brooklyn. "It's not all about killing. There's an upside
to it."

"Joining the Army is a personal choice," agrees Devon Edmeade, 25, also
of Brooklyn. "Even if Jay-Z was passing out enlistment papers, I'm not
joining. But still -- it's a choice. They use hip-hop to market beer
and clothes. So why not the Army? I think it's cool."

But isn't it a paradox that hip-hop -- now a culture, but one based on
a genre of music rooted in inner-city resistance to the white majority
-- is being used to sell the military to African-Americans? Well, sort
of, say critics like Werner and Bakari. In many ways hip-hop's past has
little to do with its present. The last decade has seen hip-hop evolve
from gangsta rap, which reveals the hard-knock life of the projects, to
a celebratory bling-blingism that fetishizes personal acquisition and
the lifestyles of the rich and famous. From Biggie Smalls' yacht cruise
in 1997's "Hypnotize" (arguably the watershed moment for the so-called
bling-bling era) to Busta Rhymes' shill for his favorite liqueur in
2003's "Pass the Courvoisier," it's a bit hard to argue that hip-hop
shouldn't be used for marketing purposes, or to draw the line between
acceptable or unacceptable uses of hip-hop.

"What has hip-hop been used for? To market mainstream capitalist
culture," says Werner. "The contradiction is that mainstream capitalist
culture is what's keeping those kids who need the military as an escape
poor. The capitalist system wants to create a desperate labor market. It

wants to create a situation in which a whole lot of people with real
talent are so damn desperate just to make a living that they're not
going
to think about the terms on which they're offered that living. You're
signing up to perpetuate the same system that put you in the position
where you had no alternative except to sign up."

Franz Mullings, 20, a student at the New York City Technical College,
agrees. "I don't think they should exploit hip-hop to get people to join

the Army," he says. "Hip-hop's not what the government is about. They
don't care about people in the hood. They don't come around when things
are going down. They shouldn't exploit our culture."

It's not the Army's place to address or solve these issues, says Muse
Cordero Chen's Martin. "I know very few marketing campaigns that have
been able to vault over and satisfy solutions for specific larger social

problems," he says. "Our goal is to present the Army as an option for
career advancement, as a life alternative, and as a way to represent one

solution out of many for African-Americans specifically. If someone's
looking for a way out of their current position, the Army presents a
very compelling argument."

For Rangel, it's not just the message -- it's the medium. "It's so
unfair to people who don't have an even playing field in this country to

give them the option to run around in Hummers and play hip-hop games,"
he
says, "when, at the end of the day, what you're talking about is
putting their life on the line."
"An undisciplined state of mind gives rise to delusions that propel an
individual into negative action, which then creates the negative
environment in which the person lives."-Chandrakirti

I am looking for a writers' group (not a class) to do critiques of poetry
with.  Do these groups have admission criteria?  I have published some poems
in print, but not very many, and also I have some poems online in various
ezines.  But I am not (yet, I hope) a successful poet.  However I am pretty
focused on submitting and getting published, and I do web art and writing
full-time, so I am pretty serious, not just a hobbyist.  I also participate
on a lot of readings and have been a featured reader in two series in
Buffalo.  But now I am in New York, which is likely a bigger pond...

Thanks.

radical intervention in publishing - a celebration of direct action
movements across the planet, unfiltered by the mainstream media, and told
through the words and images of the people who were (and still are) there.

Aw Geez Bill,

I was gonna send you one sometime soon. I guess I got too caught up in
setting the place up down here in FL. No big deal. Can you let me know when
you're accepting subs again? I'll send something. Hope things are going
well.

Best,

V.

Subject:      will the real Thomas Swan . . .
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I came across a brief article by Steve (McCaffery?) on 17th-century British
poet Thomas Swan, at the Patapoetics site:
<http://www.poetics.yorku.ca/article.php?sid=34>. Steve highly recommends
_A Selection from the Works of Thomas Swan_ (West House Books, 2001), which
the editors (Martin Corless-Smith and Alan Halsey) claim is the first
airing of Swan's work since the Worcester Antiquarian Society edition of
1876. I purchased the short collection and was delighted to find out about
the strange and wonderful writings of this seventeenth-century
"postmodernist." I've read his work to friends, asking them to guess the
identity and period of the poet (some guess 20th century; others say
Blake).

Then I came across the following website:
<http://www.shearsman.com/pages/magazine/back_issues/shearsman53/reviews53.html>
 There, Tony Frazer claims that Swan is an "imaginary" poet invented by
Corless-Smith and Halsey. I'm curious to know whether anyone has
information about whether Swan was a historical person or made up. (Steve's
article, by the way, seems convincing.) I can't find any other information
about Swan on the internet or in databases such as the MLAIB, perhaps
because his rediscovery (if he is indeed for real) is so very recent.

Thanks.

Another story of American soldiers killing and mutilating hundreds of =
unarmed villagers in Vietnam in 1967 was just published. "The Army's =
4-and-one-half-year investigation never made public, was initiated by a =
soldier outraged at the killings. The probe substantiated 20 war crimes =
by 18 soldiers and reached the Pentagon and the White House before it =
was closed in 1975, The (Toledo) Blade said. William Doyle, a former =
Tiger Force sergeant living in Willow Springs, Mo., said he killed so =
many civilians he lost count....The atrocities carried out by the unit =
came just months before the killing of about 500 Vietnamese civilians by =
an Army unit in 1968 at My Lai." The Toledo Blade did the 8-month =
investigation, and the story was picked up by the Associated Press. It's =
on Page 9 of today's Oregonian, but I haven't seen it yet in the NYT or =
other newspapers. We'll see if it makes the TV news at all.=20

want to do is read you latest blog-post. RSS brings the most recent
information to the reader instead of people having to run-around to
different sites. With a RSS-reader you can easily keep up-to-date with
200+ blogs/per day which is impossible when you are trying to visit
each-and-every-one of those sites individually.

* http://bloglines.com * is a good free online RSS-reader. *Try it* with
the above referenced OPML file (import it thru 'Manage Subscriptions')
to get going. There are many stand-alone applications out there as well
(just search for 'RSS reader').

Do you recognize the source of the (apparently) Louis
Zukofsky phrase, "That one could, etc.", that Robert
Creeley uses as an epigraph on p. 62 of his book ~So
There~ ('[Thinking of L.Z., "That one could, etc."]')?

Thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

I know this one!!! The Creeley poem on page 62 is a fine one but there
should be a footnote or something. It's far to squished onto the page, which
is a problem I have with Creeley's publishings. It would be great for them
to have there own space or context - but that would be a huge book and I'll
be that New Directions would care to do that. But anyway, Creeley's poems is

THE
        [thinking of L.Z. "that
           one could, etc."]
A's

refers to exactly what you have been dwelling on, the 'the's' and the 'A's'
Zukofsky said once that "a case can be made out for the giving some of his
life to the use of the words 'the' and 'a': both of which are weighted with
as much epos and historical destiny as one man can perhaps resolve." Creeley
was really taken with this idea and thus your long search in his works. In
Creeley's collected essay's _A Note_ on page 58 he contiunes on Zukofsky
phrase by saying, "how much world can lie between 'the' and 'a' is hardly
for either 'a' and 'the' grammarian to decide. We may speak of 'the' as some
thing previously noted or recognized and of 'a' as that which has not been
thus experienced -- but to think that "from A to Z" may mean something, and
that if one looks at an 'A' it may possibly become a sawhorse. This refers
to a poem quote that starts "Horses: ..." down to the line "Be necks, two
legs stand A, four together M."

I hope that helps.


> the Futurepoem deadline for this year was September 30th.

Crapppppppppppppp. I felt so awful inside that I didn't have anything, nor
did I make an attempt. I put this together for the Futurepoem contest but at
least I have it. I think it's a nice bit for me. Consiodering that last year
was the Superman epic.

I am starting a new job tomorrow. It's a part time job at the mall in a shop
called "Le Gourmet Chef." It's like William Sonoma but with more food
stuffs. It should be fine but I feel a certain reluctance to go back to the
mall. I told myself I would never go back there to work a christmas ever
again. But I am happy to have a job and that all of my poetry goals are
satisfied to move forward. I used this time well. I had a good reading, a
new manuscript, a feeling of freedom within poetry, and a board member /
bookkeeper of a not-for-profit publisher. This is Ted Pelton's press,
Starcherone. We have known each other for a while but he asked me to help
out when he found out I know accounting. This should be fun which will
conteract the sould sucking that will happen in the mall.

Best, Geoffrey

Probably others have responded to this question through the backchannels
but my address for Maria doesn't work.  I've tried twice.  Perhaps there
is a firewall somewhere.

At any rate, the anthology by Ken Knabb called The Situationist
International Anthology doesn't have any poetry in it, insofar as I
recall.  The Situationists broke with the Lettrists in the mid to late
50s.  The Lettrists were poets, one could alost say along LANGUAGE
lines.  Except they were often just writing letters rather than even
complete words, so the breakdown was more complete.  I don't know if
anybody actually reads those things -- except the theory is sometimes
caprcious and entertaining.  Isidore Isou was their leader, as perhaps
Tzara was for the Dadaists.  Isou was also a Romanian.  I believe that
they broke with the Situationists precisely over the question of art.
The Situationists wanted a supersession of art in favor of passionate
moments, moments that they called situations.  I don't know if they
succeeded in this domain.  Their major output in terms of literature
seems to have been dogmatic essays with a flair for surrealist caprice
-- they almost appear to have been a mixture of Lukacs and Breton.  The
only writer I really love is Ivan Chtcheglov, who is first in the
anthology.  He wrote only this one article on a poetics of urbanism, and
then was enrolled in an asylum for the rest of his life.  Chtcheglov's
essay is convulsive and arresting. Guy Debord is the most famous
Situationist -- a sort of Breton -- but even more domineering, and much
less brilliant.  He was dying of alcoholism when he apparently shot
himself in the head.  His medical condition is probably more complicated
than that, but I can't remember the details.

The Situationists in May 68 worked with some of the surviving
surrealists to create odd explosive phrases.  I think it was Michel
Leiris and a situationist who wrote the famous phrase, "Be realistic:
demand the impossible!"

But whereas Breton seemingly came to despair of revolution, and found
all his attempts to create beauty in life to come to nothing but
pessimism, but was a really fine poet and novelist after all, the
Situationists seem to have really tried to focus on turning life into
art.  Therefore, there isn't much art to speak of.  Breton felt that a
poem could initiate a convulsive chain of events that would later come
to be revealed in life.  He was a poet first, and for him language was
some kind of alchemical tool.

The situationists' slogans of May 68 -- at least the memorable ones,
were mostly written by surviving surrealists as far as I can see, and
come out of surrealist theory.

"Be realistic: demand the impossible!"  -- this is pure Bretonian
surrealism.  To demand the impossible inside of the real is the surreal
demand that the Freudian dream come to fruition within the dreary
economic world, and is how the surrealists tried to squirrel away from
the vulgar Marxist insistence that economics was all-determining by
turning toward Freud.

A book that I really enjoyed is called A Cavalier History of Surrealism,
by Raoul Vaneigem.  It's a situationist primer of surrealism, and shows
what the sits thought of the surrealists, and how they took a great deal
from them.

There is an interesting sidelight -- among many -- that one of the top
situationists later became a leading member of the PLO.  I can't
remember his name but he wrote a tract entitled De la misere en milieu
etudiant.

A Sunday afternoon poetry reading:

        Trevor Joyce
            Steve McCaffery
                Lise Downe

        October 26th, 3 pm
            at New Works Studio
                (319 Spadina, second floor)

The Irish poet Trevor Joyce (author of _with the first dream of fire they
hunt the cold: A Body of Work 1966-2000_) is touring North America this
fall. This is his only Canadian stop. He is joined by two of Toronto's
finest poets: Steve McCaffery, whose many publications include the
two-volume selected poems _Seven Pages Missing_ from Coach House; & Lise
Downe, author of (most recently) _Disturbances of Progress_ from Coach
House.

For this occasion The Gig has published two new chapbooks by Trevor Joyce:
_Take Over_, translations from the Chinese & Irish; & _Undone, Say_,
collecting original work including the long prose-poem "Stillsman." Together
they contain all of his material written since with the first dream. These
new books will be available at the reading.

For more information about the reading or about the chapbooks, phone Nate
Dorward at (416) 221 6865, or email ndorward@sprint.ca.

*

Trevor will also be reading in the States in the weeks following his Toronto
stop: go to http://www.soundeye.org/trevorjoyce/readingsschedule.html for

in november of 2001, within four days, harrison ford and bill murray were
spotted at poetry readings here in nyc, ford at the jeni olin/jordan davis
reading at kgb bar, and murray at the poets house anniversary, where, word
has it, he would up reading some creeley to those in attendance. i haven't
seen any celebs since then.

so sunday, at the small press fair organized by ugly duckling presse in the
dumbo section of brooklyn, i'm sitting at my table spreading the good boog
word, and who do i see at the table across from me but maura tierney from
er. i gave a hello but wasn't able to get any boog cities into her hand,
though some other presses clamored to her and gave her freebies.

in all, quite bizarre seeing her out of context, but cool to see her walking
booth to booth to see what everyone was up to.

and now, back to your regular programming.

best,
david

How do you write?

Philadelphia Progressive Poetry Calendar

6 questions for Poetry & Empire

1) Can poetry challenge militarized language
& propaganda?

2) Do genre models need to be rearticulated
in light of new world dynamics?

3) To what degree do our actions as poets
affect larger contexts?

4) How do the structures of poetic communities
resist or reinforce existing power structures?

5) What underlying values inform our practice as poets?

6) What can a poem do?

The problem of scenes in a minor city
(Life in Canada)

Do line breaks have meaning?

Someone has pointed out to me a key omission in the promo material for the
Joyce/McCaffery/Downe reading: it's 319 Spadina _Avenue_, i.e. south of
Bloor.  I'm told it's near Chockies, a liquor store, &c.

Sorry about that--you can tell that even 7 years after arriving in Toronto
I'm still a bit vague on city geography & streetnames.... -- all best --N

In the category of "now we're poets let's be friends and bare all", this one
is, perhaps, high modernist cake, and well, frosting:

"The trouble with your poetry, Frost, is that it has subjects."

Wallace Stevens to Robert Frost while on a train trip to Florida as quoted
by Robert Frost in a 1963 remembrance and review of Frost's legacy by Robert
Lowell in the New York Review of Books.


Found that one in an abandoned copy on the street in the book, "Selections:

publisher forgot to put the year of the publication page on the copyright

Small Press Traffic presents
Friday, October 24, 2003 at 7:30 p.m.
kari edwards & Gail Scott

Anne Waldman says of kari edwards? first novel, a day in the life of p.
(Subpress, 2002): "Burroughsian, transgressive, exceedingly sharp and
witty?startling and entertaining. What?s solid? This picaresque book is the
dislocated yet substantive narration of the future." And Kevin Killian, who
will introduce hir at SPT, says "[the] book is side-splittingly funny, when it
wants to be, and tragic and mystic in turns from page to page. Like Marcel
Duchamp?s Rrose Selavy, ?p? gives a new twist to our received ideas of
heroism, kindness, and lucidity." edwards received a Bay Area Award in
Literature from New Langton Arts in 2002; previous works include a diary of
lies (Belladonna, 2002) and post/(pink) (Scarlet Press, 2001).

Gail Scott joins us in celebration of the US publication of her novel, My
Paris, by Dalkey Archive. Eileen Myles says "[she] has redefined landscape to
include all weather, inside and out, including sex and a female sexual
vision--a vision of being that's pure animation, an action made up of all the
tiny windows of information constantly opening and closing in the rhythm of
the way we know a place in time, for instance Paris. Her Paris is pretty
stunning art." Scott?s other novels are Heroine and Main Brides. She is a
coeditor of Narrativity and her translation of Michael Delisle's The Sailor?s
Disquiet was shortlisted for the prestigious Governor General's award in 2001.
She joins us from Montreal and will be introduced by Robert Glück.

Cosponsored by the Poetry Center; held at Small Press Traffic.

1) Can poetry challenge militarized language & propaganda?



Isn't this ironically modernist, in the sense that it reflects an
attempt or will to purify the language?

Another way to put it: isn't every use somehow related to some form of
control?  If we are to take this binary of abuse/non-abuse, how would we
determine (what criteria) that propaganda is an abuse while, say, a poem
by Alan Sondheim is not?

Further, is a man standing by his word necessarily Fascist because it
was true of Pound?

Even deeper, is language by its very nature violent?  If so, does the
development of language in humans correspond with, say, a rise in
violence, war, and so on, or maybe even a species-wide shift to
patriarchy?

Maybe language cannot undo violence.  In fact I'm sure it cannot.

I just finished writing my fourth book, which is a deeper exploration of
propaganda, particularly in the political arena (whereas Lester's book
explores the roots of language as a technology of control).

Les's book seems to argue that while language may be steeped in a will
to control, there's a competing force, namely poetry, ambiguity,
repetition into oblivion, and even nonsense.

At one point I thought these two competing forces could act
independently of one another, but now I am not so sure.  I think the
competition is a model for understanding the channel that language uses,
that the contradictory state may be our best explanation of how language
can be used for both poetry and control.  Further, poetry IS a means of
control just as it is a means of liberation, and this conflict is a
representational one.

What's more, there's no doubt that poetry is a place for political
discourse.  For one, inspiration is a catalyst for change.  Language may
also give people new ideas.  If you can actually read and/or understand
a political poem, it may provide you insight into something you've never
thought of before.

So propaganda is business-as-usual for language: a technology of control
by leveraging the familiar within language.  Poetry seems to be able to
do what propaganda does, plus a whole lot more (but wait, that's not all
folks! TM).

If it's Dean-Clark in 2004, Dean gets shot after winning the election
and the Republicans rule once again.

But that's a fairy tale.  The 2004 election is already over, unless the
American people make sure that electronic voting is removed from the
electoral process until it is secure from even the most novice of haxors
and crackers.  While voting fraud in Chicago, Florida, Nebraska, or
Tennessee is one thing, nationwide automated fraud is quite a leap--at
least two or three orders of magnitude larger in scope--while having the
added benefit of being easily obscured.

But of course I'm just one of those paranoid conspiracy types.  You know
the kind.

The poetics of the Justin Timberlake generation are a sort of
anti-poetics.  Brian Stefans and Philip Nikolayev have approached this
question with novel solutions (Nikolayev in his essay on poetic anarchy
in Fulcrum 2, and Stefans in his recent writing on "The Creeps" in his
blog).  I think they are both very good approaches to a poetics, in that
they engage in discourse not only on generational affinities but also on
higher-level tendencies.

I do believe the current generation's poetics is anarchistic.  There is
no center to a distributed network.  The centers of power in poetry,
through the power of the internet, have been subverted, circumvented,
and overridden.  There's no other explanation than the internet, for
example, as to how someone like myself, who is or at least was
completely un-enfranchised (to coin a term) in the poetry world, has 70
plus poems published in journals in the last two years.  How could
something like this have happened without the central domination of a
university-endorsed poetics?

Orson Scott Card predicted this sort of phenomenon in his 1985 novel
_Ender's Game_, where the young Ender participates and influences
political policy by hiding behind a virtual identity (his age alone
would otherwise serve to encourage the public to discredit or ignore his
views).

Blogs seem to kill the community aspect of internet communications.
Hardly are blogs some sort of answer or genre....  They are nothing but
content management systems with almost every feature removed except
journaling.  Fortunately I work for an organization that is looking to
solve that problem with an application called Lyceum, which will be a
blogsphere application.  Essentially, reading blogs will become no
different from, say, searching the on-line UBPoetics List archives,
except that it will have channel features (whose syndications you opt to
receive).  So in effect, I will build a blog page that pulls data from
other blogs and puts them together.  We can do that now with RSS feeds,
but it requires a little technical skill beyond installing software.

What will become more interesting is when Joe User will have an
operating system that automatically facilitates syndicated publishing to
the internet, without requiring any additional skills other than
installing the operating system, typing, and using a mouse.

The idea of a higher consciousness, of rising above the oppressive use
of language, went out the door with LSD.  We can't spend our lives dosed
on lysergic acid, though of course a brave few have tried.

A poetics of the day must be entwined, as it always is, with the
physical constraints of poetry.  What is the medium?  Is it oral?
Written?  Static?  Dynamic?  What language(s)?  How is it distributed?

One way of exploring present-day (or presently) poetics is by noting the
twin importance of distribution and process.  The former is radically
important to the very way poetry is written AND received.  The medium
always shapes the content and in effect makes the content.

At the beginning of the 18th century in England, printing presses were
becoming widely available, and a publishing boom was underway.  All sort
of entrepreneurs began purchasing printing presses and printing books.
In the 18th century we have many businesses borrowing money from banks
to acquire publishing equipment.  But how can these publishers provide
collateral for the banks?

Voila! The Statute of Queen Anne!  Make the produce of writers property,
and make the reproductions equal property!  So the British Government
invents the notion of intellectual property.  Some starving writers were
dragged out to claim that Copyright law would protect them, while in
essence the law was poised to grant publishers the status of protected
"copyright proprietors."   The law made industrial privilege essential
to publishing, but more importantly, and more germane to a present-day
poetics, it made ideas ownable and also made the trade of reproductions
ownable.  Ownable, meaning controllable.  The copy of the idea remains
property of the person who in effect "owns" the original, and that is
the "copyright proprietor," the bookseller.

The notion of Copyright directly challenges classicism.  In a broad
sense classicism seems to suggest that everything that is said has been
said before, and that the muse is indifferent to identity.  (I see much
of classicism through the eyes of Borges, who interestingly enough was
blind.)  Authorship in classicism in some sense is little more than a
footnote to a work, whereas with the creation of the Copyright Law of
1710, it became everything.  The capital investment of booksellers and
publishers is protected while the labor of the author is not.

"Problems in the containment of representation" (Susan Stewart)
increasingly drive the development of the literary hoax over the course
of the last 300 years, perhaps reaching a climax at least in poetry in
the last few years, with the rise of the fake hoax (see Jacket #17).

And so here we are, almost 300 years after the invention of copyright.
The last 300 years has upended the authorlessness of classicism with the
solipsism of Romanticism and its revenue-happy stepchild, the MFA
program.

The digital revolution is eroding the notion of the distinction between
the real and the fake (refer to the work of KK Ruthven or Hillel
Schwartz), just as the literary hoax is.  It is not too incredible,
then, to see that the literary hoax and the digital revolution intersect
at the point of the internet avatar.  The avatar, then, is a nexus for
the development of poetics in the near future.

This is a poetics.

The open source revolution in software is poised to send our poetics to
a new form of classicism, to a state where it does not make sense to
treat writing as intellectual capital.  Already the open sourcers are
fighting the intellectual property wars over filesharing/mp3
distribution, issues which address the very essence of copyright laws in
the context of an artistic medium.  Intellectual property is in cultural
jeopardy, and cultural jeopardy changes law.

The poetics of the present day, then, the relevant poetics, deal with
issues of how poetry transcends and yet is immersed in the categories of
realness and fakeness, and how poetry ultimately obliterates that
distinction.  This is a mirror of classicism, where there is no concern
for the authenticity of the author--the classicist believes the author
is but a figure that represents the inspiration provided by the muse,
and the literal existence of a muse means nothing to validate or
invalidate that view.  Poetry in present-day (or the soon-to-come)
decentralized classicism is neither authentic nor fake, and yet it is
both authentic and fake.  This doubling of authenticity and spuriosity
has been the domain that the present-day literary hoax exploits,
(Interestingly, the poetry hoax is a phenomenon marginalized by the very
structures of poetry-power.  E.g., contests require the obliteration of
autobiographical notes, which precludes Lester from entering his book in
any contest, since his work is a spoof on hoaxes and on identity, as a
fake fake.)

The domain of the literary hoax, the space created by the obliteration
of the distinction between real and fake, is now rapidly expanding
thanks in part to another obliteration--the destruction of the barriers
to global distribution thanks to the World Wide Web.  It no longer makes
sense to make ideas property, at least not to the culture where its
members live large percentages of their lives on the internet, where its
members, its children, effectively ignore copyright, a realm where the
ubiquitous motto among artists is, "the best steal." That ultimate view
towards stealing, borrowing, sampling, is really just classicism seen
through the lingering haze of the copyright era.

In the wake of the coming post-copyright era, as web presence and
avatar-ing become more and more banal, an anarchism of poetics will
inevitably take hold and then of course fade.

Patrick, I think some of your speculative and utopic projections re the
future of publishing/internet and copyright are perhaps clever-by-half. The
"classics", for example, were owned by some body, usually some body variousl
called the family, tribe, province or nation state - an an author or group
of authors probably got a message real quickly if they broke the rules, or,
at least, were not given permission to redefine the 'classical' container -
whether that be in the form of a statue or a public manuscript. Like, say,
looking for avant-garde Dada extant remakes of Buddha circa 1,000 AD is not
likely, or ones that the public would ever be allowed to know.
Publishing poetry or otherwise will always - in my opinion - be involved in
ownership, as well as conflicts in ownership - that is struggles between the
author and the maker of the container of the publication (the publisher) and
beyond that, the State. Each entity has a different agenda.

Publishing is a little bit like male sex, or maybe ought to be. It's not how
long one is, but how it's use! The publisher (which may include the
author(s)) invests x amount of time, resources, materials etc. to create the
container and take it into the market. This publisher naturally wants to
secure sales that will protect the investment and ultimately create a
profit, whereby a livelihood is secured and enough money remains to do more
books. Copyright, or the rights secured from the author, insure protection
for the investment.

At best, authors and or their agents, don't give away the horse with the
race (sales), but secure an agreement that compels the publisher to do x, y
and z within a certain time frame. If the book is not selling, not in
distribution, etc., the rights come back. No longer does an author have to
sign over the rights in perpetua to a publisher.  Back to the sex analog,
it's performance - in this case, the market place - that serves the
relationship.

Sorry, if I sound like I am lecturing, but I have been through this from
every side of the coin, or lack of such.

I am sure like many of us, the Internet has created this vast channel of
exposure, multiple kinds of sharing, etc., and it's been great delight to
access an abundance of all kinds of cultural information, including, poetry,
and more poetry! And its all been a boon(m) to us armchair Google
researchers that do not live in, at least, a great University's research
lap, even if the information is often not "authoritative", something that an
ideal publisher has an implicit commitment.   And the hoaxes and the
simulations are also part of it, and ones, witness the Gothics News Service,
of which I enjoyed making to the hilt. It's all part of the big chemistry of
shaking up the emperor's lousy clothes

End of the day, however, digital fluidity - at least my sense of it - still
remains in a nether world that begs for concretization (will let's say 'in
dialog with the material world' of production). I watch locally - with great
affection - the New Brutalists - a group in part bonded by blogs and
continental internet connections, but whose devotion is equally or more
devloted printed formats, chap books, letter press & offset, to
performance,) and old fashioned correspondence (post card poems). I think
the whole mix/matrix of formats and channels is at wonderful play, and
definitely a new opening on the present - and one of which the digital is an
integral aspect

Livelihood and one's makings (poems) inevitably come back to contracts (even
on stated on  the resume for the job in the local community college) of
which copyright (the ownership and control of what you make) will remain
essential and variously protected. And there will be screaming and all sorts
of anger and retribution promised if it isn't.

It's always - ownership - somewhere inherent in the dialog.

LYRIC has been recently described as an "elegantly produced magazine that
has discovered a whole new young audience," presenting poetry by Americans
and translations of both little-known and celebrated poets from around the
world. LYRIC seeks poetry with true singing power distinguished by
musicality and lyricism and publishes lyric essays that use poetic logic and
relate a mosaic of ideas. Established in January 2001 at City Lights Books,
LYRIC has relocated and is now the only Houston-based independent literary
journal.

MELISSA HOTCHKISS is the author of Storm Damage. Her poetry has appeared in
Marlboro Review, LIT, Upstairs at Duroc, The Lyric Review, 3rd Bed, and
other magazines. Her prose has appeared in the New Virginia Review and The
New York Times. Melissa has read at over 40 venues in Maine, Vermont, Utah,
Virginia, and New York City. She is also a founding editor of Barrow Street
and also ran the Barrow Street Reading Series in the West Village for 8
years.

RACHEL ZUCKER's first full-length collection is Eating in the Underworld
(Wesleyan 2003), a series of poems that follows the narrative arc of the
myth of Persephone. Her second collection, The Last Clear Narrative, a cross
examination of marriage and motherhood, will be published by Wesleyan some
time in 2005. Zucker is the winner of the Salt Hill Poetry Award (1999,
judged by C.D. Wright) and the Barrow Street Poetry Prize (2000). In 2002
she won the Center for Book Arts Award (judged by Lynn Emanuel) for her long
poem, "Annunciation" which was published as a limited edition chapbook. Her
poems have appeared in many journals including: 3rd Bed, American Poetry
Review, Barrow Street, Colorado Review, Epoch, Fence, Iowa Review, Pleiades
and Prairie Schooner as well as in the Best American Poetry 2001 anthology.
Zucker has taught at Yale, NYU and the 92nd Street Y. She has also worked as
a photographer, day care teacher and gem dealer. She lives in New York with
her husband, writer Josh Goren, and their two sons. She is currently working
on her fourth collection of poems and coediting an anthology, Writing Under
the Influence, with poet Arielle Greenberg.

Steve,

I appear to have done a poor job of informing George Stanley about our
proposed Maine activities. He says he plans to take the 9 a.m.
Boston-Bangor bus on Thursday, the 30th. Could you send both of us an email
with a list of all proposed events, with times, etc.? George can be reached
for at least the next couple of days at:

larryfagin@earthlink.net

The phone number there is 212.254.6621.

Hope all's well with you. I look forward to seeing you. Regards, Kevin D

Yeah, take care of George. He is a great poet. He likes the Raiders,
but he is still a great poet.

Steve--

What do you know about Erik Noonan?  His Weigh Station III is dripping
intelligence and his piece on Villon therein warms me in a discernable
manner.  You know him personally from VT?  Now he's hooked up with Micah
in San Fran.  My first impression (for less than a day) and I'm
impressed.

Now wait just one minute! That stuff that went on between me and
Pierre wads just collegial, only some mutual recognition of our
devotion to the poetry of X.J. Kennedy. Okay, we may have embraced a
few times, but he's a European, eh?

Kirby and the list--

The "fair use" statute that other responses to this thread have mentioned,
17 U.S.C. Sec. 107, lists examples of fair use, and the first one listed is
"criticism."  Also, the Judiciary Committee report on the bill that became
this section contains an agreement reached between a group of authors and
publishers and a group of universities, giving guidelines for "classroom
copying" by non-profit educational institutions.  The agreement says that a
single copy for personal use or multiple copies for classroom use may be
made of a complete poem of less than 250 words (also not more than 2 pages),
or an excerpt of less than 250 words.  The use must also be spontaneous
(basically, an individual teacher's spur of the moment teaching decision,
with no practical time for getting permission), and it can't result in a
de-facto anthology.  The legal citation for this report is H.R. Rep. No.
94-1476, and it's reproduced at the websites of many university libraries as
part of their photocopying policy.

Of course, copying for classroom use and quotation within a critical article
or book are different types of uses, but a good argument could be made that
fair use in critical pieces should be broader than in classroom use, because
a critical piece surrounds the borrowed material with lots of original
material (the critical analysis), thus meeting factor (1) of the "fair use"
test ("the purpose and character of the use"), and use in a critical piece
is  less likely to reduce the market value of the borrowed material (factor
(4)).  After all, when an instructor photocopies a poem and distributes it
to a class, he or she reduces the chance that the students will buy a book
or lit. mag. containing the poem.  But no one is likely to pick up a
critical piece as a substitute for buying the same material.  So if
reproduction of a poem or excerpt from a poem is "fair use" for classroom
photocopying, it ought to be even clearer "fair use" in a critical article
or book.  And it shouldn't make ANY difference whether the critical piece is
an article or a book; none of the cases or treatises I looked at even hinted
that this distinction mattered.  And lawyers are VERY good at drawing
distinctions where an ordinary sane person wouldn't see any!

I also looked for an Yvor Winters case.  I won't bore the list with a
recitation of all the research strategies I used, but the name "Yvor
Winters" is pretty distinctive, and I used a legal search engine that pulls
up published as well as unpublished cases.  I also looked in copyright
treatises and in law review articles, in case the dispute somehow was known
in the field some other way (as it might be if it was settled for a lot of
money, for example).  I found nothing.  I also found no case in which a
critic, Yvor Winters or anyone else, was held liable for quoting poetry in a
critical work.  Of course, our wonderful legal system allows people to sue
for anything and put the defendant to the expense of defending himself or
herself, but with such a complete absence of legal authority, and with the
express language in the statute, I would hope that the press planning to
publish the critical piece would show some backbone and resist paying for
permission.  There is such a thing as an award of attorney's fees against
someone who brings a frivolous lawsuit.

If you want a case, there's a long discussion of fair use, and a ringing
endorsement of the right to use excerpts, in *New Era Publications
International v. Carol Publishing Group,* 904 F.2d 152 (2d Cir. 1990).  It's
a victory for the author of an expose of the Church of Scientology who used
liberal quotations from works by L. Ron Hubbard.  The opinion talks about
the theory of fair use, mentions that literary criticism is one of the core
examples of fair use, and sounds the trumpet for freedom of quotation.

Could it be that the Yvor Winters case is some kind of literary urban myth?
I hate to think of people on this list holding back from writing about
poetry because they think they'd have to pay high permission costs or legal
fees.  Everyone is better off if there's more material published, not less.
Isn't that so?  Sorry for the long post; just hoping to be helpful.

I believe it is somewhat of a myth that authorship was of no - or
almost no - interest in olden days. After all the term of plagiarism
was coined after Martialis in the first century had discovered that
Fidentinus had published his poems as if they were Fidentinus' own.
(The word is derived from 'plagiarius', which is the word Martialis
used for Fidentinus' theft. The word means kidnapper or abductor.)

Otherwise during antiquity the highest virtue was maybe to tread in
somebody else's footsteps, to maintain a tradition as well as
possible. But the line between on the one hand achieving something
personal within a tradition and, on the other, depending on tradition
so heavily that the application of rule, form, manner etc turned into
imitation and plagiarism was not very well defined.

I am not so sure that "The notion of Copyright directly challenges
classicism" as Patrick Herron said. What it certainly does challenge
is the manuscript era. The notion of copyright as it is today
protects a certain expression of an idea, not the idea itself. To
protect a certain 'gestalt' like this, the printed edition was a
necessary invention for this to happen. Not just - which has been
pointed out by many - that there  was no affair in copying by hand -
so this could not become a real problem until the industrial
manufacturing of books in large editions appeared. But the notion of
verbatim comparison (actually text criticism) is another important
requisite for copyright.

This also means that it is highly probable that copyright will change
now that the fixity of the printed edition is again dissolved by
digital media. Personally I don't think copyright will disappear.
Even if we would find new ways to control the economic aspects of
immaterial creativity, I believe it is paramount to keep the 'moral'
aspects of copyright, or invent some new instrument for controlling
authenticity as well as attribution of texts.

In what we call the information age - or even the knowledge society -
I believe it is a very important question to be able to keep track of
who did say what to whom about what. Otherwise intellectual
discussion would almost return to oral tradition with the kind of
distortion that comes with it.

I don't know anything about the Queen Anne copyright laws.  Why did this happen
then?  she was only Queen for about five years as I recall -- in the early
1700s.  Is this because of increased production of printing.  Who pushed for
this new copyright law?  When does Grub Street come into play with hack writers
making a marginal living in the London bohemia?  I had the sense that Marlowe
and Greene and even young Shakespeare had a hand in this era.  There were
authorized and unauthorized printing of plays.  I think the authorized plays
were printed by the companies themselves?  Certainly writers were making a
living before Queen Anne's time -- for instance, the woman who Oronooko -- made
a handsome living off of it -- I forget her name.  Shakespeare made some kind of
living -- from his ventures at the Globe Theatre.  Part of this was probably
patronage.  But if you haven't got patronage, you have to be able to sell the
goods to another group -- for instance, the public.  Poets today can live off
students, and not have to sell their work.

Ginsberg made 60 thou off his Collected Poems but made the lion's share of his
money teaching and going from college to college to give readings.  To make it
possible for the writer to live we need some kind of financial feedback.  Corso
had patrons -- but his letters which just came out are one long continual
request for money from anybody he can put the touch on.  He borrowed from Mafia
men and got his head beat in according to rumor when he couldn't pay back.

There are a few like James Merrill who are born with a tremendous trust fund
which means excellent education, can publish their own work if they like, and
never worry, but this is the situation for very few.  Apollinaire wrote porno,
Soupault wrote journalism, Breton sold paintings, etc.  Tzara counted receipts
at the end of a Dada night, and later married a wealthy Swedish woman.  They
owned a beautiful house in Montmartre built by Adolf Loos.

But for the poor and principled, copyright remains one of the most hopeful
methods of gaining money.  And occasionally somebody strikes it rich --
Brautigan, for instance, or Henry Miller, or Bukowski, if they manage to
encapsulate the feeling of a generation.

I don't know if this will happen again for a poet.  Most poets don't even seem
to want to speak to those who are outside of poetry.

But poetry continues to require financial circulation -- and nobody will get
involved with that unless there is a stake in it of some kind.

Patrick raises fascinating questions here.  To think of the finances of a poet
-- Whitman, Poe, Marianne Moore, etc.  And what is the best way to support
oneself.  I often wish I had trained to be a plumber.  Outside the European
publishing industry, in what remains of marginal societies, I imagine the poet
is or was paid with a lesser share of the hunting, or something.  It takes
enormous energy to write, or to dream up poetry, and that has to be compensated,
or it can't continue.

There is a bizarre idea that comes out of what I think is a false memory
implanted by a generation of feminists who had misread Nietzsche's friend JJ
Bachofen that there was once a matriarchal world in which everybody shared
equally, and sex and everything else was free.  I don't think this world ever
existed.  I'm reading a book called The Myth of Matriarchy, by a women's studies
scholar named Cynthia Eller, who teaches at Montclair in NJ.  The book
completely destroys this myth.  The law of the father -- ownership -- in
Lacanian terms -- has probably always been central.  Zizek says so in all his
books, and is getting increasingly strident on this topic.  Although I think
Zizek's mostly a nut, he's probably right about this..

              Where am I?

              The cardinal points are lost in a heap, like four
              aces shuffled in a pack of cards."
                              --Vicente Huidobro


last night i sat in the basement of the Philadelphia Quaker Friends School to
hear Gloria Pacis, mother of the openly gay marine Stephen Eagle Funk, now in
prison for being a conscientious objector to America's aggression against
Iraq.  one of the first things i noticed was the absence of the gay press,
probably busy making rainbow posters to support Philadelphia Republican candidate
for mayor Sam Katz, who is using what Betsy Piette called "the FBI's racist
witch hunt" against Democrat mayor John Street, in order to gain control of the
city government.  but that's another story, another very ugly story.

before hearing Gloria read her son's letters from prison, and read her speech
she'll be reading this saturday at the march in DC, i wasn't sure how i felt
about the stand Funk has taken.  the issue of gays in the military in
particular has bothered me in the past, or rather the steady focus both Clinton and
the press had given it in recent years.  as far as i was concerned, there were
far more pressing issues that the gay community needed to challenge.

but i started to hear the story of how Stephen's sister Katie (a political
activist) had helped him come out of the closet.  this is no small thing for a
marine to do.  in fact it's quite dangerous, even needing to be held in
protective custody while in military prison.

in the beginning Stephen would write speeches for his sister to read for him
at political rallies.  but when he gained the courage to take the microphone
and tell his own story, he also started talking to the chaplain on his military
base. but he wasn't just talking to the chaplain about being a gay marine, he
was also starting to talk about his feelings for a war we were about to begin
that he felt was wrong, and immoral.  the fact that the pope was very openly
against the invasion of Iraq would allow any Catholic chaplain the right to
also firmly declare this war immoral.

for years i've well understood poor and working class kids joining the armed
services with visions of bettering themselves, getting out of poverty, seeing
the world, maybe being able to go to school after they've served their time.
but along with that also came a sense of duty, a sense of responsibility to
defend America's shores and people.  this is something that every member of my
family who has served has believed themselves a part of, this sense of
protection of freedom, and justice.

when i was sitting there listening to Gloria Pacis read her son's letters
from prison, it became very clear that this was a young man who had once believed
in the very same things my own family has believed or continues to believe.
Stephen Eagle Funk is part Filipino and part Native American.  to be exact,
his mother said he is part Crow.  and upon hearing this it further solidified my
understanding of Stephen's belief in defending America.  the Crow Indians
were the tribe, in fact the only tribe of the west and pacific north west to aid
the white settlers in the war against the tribes.  when i lived for a brief
time in New Mexico i heard plenty of racial slurs against the Crow from other
Native Americans, as well as from the strange white New Age community, accusing
them of destroying the country by turning it over to the white devils.  and
really, who can blame them for their anger?  but when i started to read the
books of Frank B. Linderman, which were interviews he conducted with the Crow
Chief Plenty Coups, and their medicine woman Pretty Shield, it became clear that
the Crow believed the white men to merely be another tribe who had come to aid
them in their own hour of need.  the Lakota in particular, according to Chief
Plenty Coups, wanted to wipe the Crow off the face of the earth.  genocide, in
other words.  the Crow fought alongside the mainly white cavalry, and
provided expertise in tracking and hunting, and other forms of survival.  so once the
Indian wars were over and it came time to divide up the small portions set
aside for reservations, the Crow of course got to pick the best locations.  and
for whatever judgments others may have, the Crow believed it was their duty to
defend the country, even under the occupation of the white rulers.

but what's a marine to do when he hears the outcry of nearly every nation on
earth that the aggression against Iraq his country was about to undertake is
racist, is wrong?  after all, we do now have gibbering, stammering military
leaders declaring this a war against Satan, aligning with the ideas of some
religious leaders in the middle east who believe that this is a Holy War.  what's a
marine to do?  especially if he believed in his heart that his duty was to
defend his country, not ruthlessly invade and occupy another.

there were several Vietnam vets in the audience who believed that the harsh
punishment handed down to Stephen was a result of his speaking out at rallies,
and trying to persuade other soldiers to refuse to fight this war.  the truth
is that the international plea for Funk's case actually awarded him a lighter
sentence than was originally intended, but the military court is still wanting
to shut him up and make an example of him.

he has a strong mother.  Gloria Pacis is an amazing woman, speaking all over
the country right now, trying to make alliances with other mothers of other
service men and women who are also outraged at the war in Iraq.  and with the
rising toll in American casualties, Gloria's pace is picking up, and her message
is being heard more than ever.  she'll be speaking on stage this saturday in
DC with others who want to end this war and make reparations to the people of
Iraq.

the lack of any press, including the gay press, last night, didn't phase a
crowd from filling the room to hear the panel who spoke with Gloria Pacis.
here's to the best for another march in DC against the American occupation of
Iraq, and hoping that peace will soon come for the Iraqi people.

i now want to share with you a letter we were handed:

ONE REFUSER TO ANOTHER: ISRAELI REFUSENIK TO US CONSCIOUS OBJECTOR
A letter from refuser Matan Kaminer, on trial - Israeli military court, to
Stephen Funk Us Marines

Dear Stephen,

Is this what they call "globalization"?

We live half a world from each other, we have led quite different lives, and
yet we are both in the same situation:  conscientious objectors to imperial
war and occupation, we are both standing military trial this summer.  Reading
your statement I couldn't help but smile at the basic sameness of military logic
around the world - including its inability to understand how anybody could be
enough against a war to resist going to kill and die in it.

But I've been presuming you're familiar with my situation.  In case you
aren't, let me fill you in briefly.  I was slated for induction into the Israeli
army in December 2002.  After a year of volunteer work in a Jewish-Arab youth
movement, I had made up my mind to refuse to enlist.  Together with other young
people in my situation, I signed the High School Seniors' Letter to PM Sharon,
and to make myself absolutely clear I sent a personal letter to the military
authorities notifying them that I was going to refuse.

They let me know they weren't about to let me go:  the army only exempts
pacifists (at least that's what it claims) and I didn't meet their definition of a
pacifist.  So beginning in December I was sentenced by 'disciplinary
proceedings' (do they have this ridiculous institution in the Marines too?) to 28 days
in military prison - three consecutive times.  After my third time in jail, I
asked to join my friend Haggai Matar, who was being court-martialed, and
within a few weeks three of our friends - Noam, Shimri and Adam - joined us.

Now we are on trial and stand to get up to three years in prison for refusing
the order to enlist.

Sounds familiar, huh?  But it's not just what they're doing to us that's
similar, it's what they're doing to others:  occupying a foreign land and
oppressing another people in the name of preventing terror.  People like you and me
know that's just an excuse for furthering economic and political interests of
the ruling elite.  But it's not the elite that pays the price.

The people who pay the price are in Jenin and Fallujah, in Ramallah and
Baghdad, in Tikrit and in Hebron.  They are the Iraqi and Palestinian children,
hog-tied face-down on the floor or shot at on the way to school.  But they are
also the Israeli and American soldiers, treated as cannon fodder by generals in
air-conditioned offices, whose only way to deal with their situation is
dehumanization - first of the strange-looking foreigners who want them dead, next of
themselves.  You can ask your Vietnam veterans or our own.

Stephen, people our age should be out learning, working and transforming the
world.  People our age should be going to parties and protests, meeting
people, falling in love and arguing about what our world should look like.  People
our age should not be moving targets, denied their human and civil rights; they
should not be military grunts, exposed to harm in mind and body, lugging
around M-16's and guilty consciences; they should not be thrown behind bars for
not wanting to kill and die.

Your trial is set to begin soon.  Mine has already begun so maybe I can give
you a few pointers.

Look the judges in the eyes.  Use every opportunity you have to explain why
you stand there.  They are human just like you, but they try to deny it to
themselves.  Don't let them.  War is shit and they know it.  They should let you
go and they know it.

It's likely that we'll both get thrown in prison when this all ends.  There
will be dark moments in prison, moments when it seems that the outside world
has forgotten all about us, that what we did and refused to do was in vain.
Well, I know what I'll do in those moments:  I'll think of you Stephen, and I'll
know that nothing we do for humanity's sake is ever in vain.

With greatest solidarity,

Dear Loss,
I would like to attend the Cage Festival events in NYC but can’t because
I am reading
at the Bowery Poetry Club at the time of the first and second, and
meeting my 5 sisters at the time of the second and third, during which
time I would also like to be at the Jerome Rothenberg reading.  I have
encountered this type of frustration before.  Can anyone advise on
methods of duplicating files of oneself, creating aliases, even — to
eliminate under and overground time between venues at least — emailing
or faxing oneself?  My first husband refused to allow the weather to
dictate to him and hence froze in the winter.  Is there anyone out there
who has side-stepped the one-body problem and managed to appear,
suavely, in several places at once?  My life more and more demands this
type of maneuver.  Backchannel suggestions welcome.
Mairead

Paula, this is excellent research.  I still wish that Maria Damon and others on
this list who have written criticism of poetry would chime in.  It seems to me
that at EVERY University press there is this kind of stipulation regarding
rights for EVERY line of poetry.  That is, that poetry must have permission.  I
have admittedly written to only about five people regarding this, but they are
unanimous.  I wish, Paula, that you were right, and that I could rest easy on
the matter.  I think it does tend to dissuade critics from writing about poetry,
which would tend to shrink the coverage.  I do think that even mean or
intemperate criticism of a poet is better than none in terms of keeping the work
alive.  It would be like having a football game in which nobody was allowed to
make any kind of comment whatsoever.  Half the fun of anything is listening to
the commentary.  I read primary texts often only in order to enjoy the
criticism!  It is for this reason that I used to love Howard Kosell's boxing
commentary.

I wish I could do better than the Yvor Winters.  You may be right that it is
urban myth.  But I did read one of his books and it WAS odd that he didn't use
citations from the poets he was discussing.

I deeply appreciate your work on this matter.  May I ask what your position is?

I think we need to hear from somebody who runs a university press that is used
to publishing poetry criticism.  What are the standard practices?  Does anybody
have access to such an individual?

Dear Mairead--Wire all the hardware in parallel, and then for software try
running several *versions* of yourself, rather than relying on exact
duplicates.  The quantum approach is also to be recommended, because then
you can exist simultaneously as both 0 and 1.

"Iraq was an appropriate target because it was completely defenseless, having
been reduced to the edge of survival by a decade of murderous sanctions,
primarily targeting the civilian population, with a toll of hundreds of thousands
dead by conservative estimate, and leaving most of the country in ruins. This
followed brutal and destructive wars and horrendous internal terror, most of
it with the backing of the US and Britain, including those now running
Washington, facts regularly suppressed. Iraq had also been virtually disarmed by
rigorous inspections, and such limited defenses as it had were destroyed by regular
US-UK bombing attacks. By the time of the invasion, Iraq was one of the
weakest states of the region, with military expenditures about a third those of
tiny Kuwait and far below the US allies in the region, let alone the US and its
British client. It is astonishing that there has been any resistance at all."

Actually, the Hindu saint Neem Karoli Bhabha (guru of
Ram Dass, Bhagvan Das, Krishna Das, among others) was
said to be able to "bio-locate" i.e. be at the ashram
chanting while simultaneaously teaching classes in
cities across India, hundreds of miles apart.

Ah, thanks so much, Steve, I'll try this.  Someone else sent me a box of

Dear Mairead--Wire all the hardware in parallel, and then for software
try
running several *versions* of yourself, rather than relying on exact
duplicates.  The quantum approach is also to be recommended, because
then

I found the following excellent set of dinstinctions here:
http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=3Dplagiarism

Plagiarism is not a crime. Originality is not the only criterion for intell=
ectual honesty. For factual nodes, originality isn't as important as accura=
cy. To be accurate, you must not only cite your sources, but check them. Ci=
tation may imply authority where there is none, as when an author is cited =
out of context. This is not plagiarism, but it is dishonest.

Other values: Ownership

First, Plagiarism isn't a crime. Copyright infringement is a crime, but dif=
fers from plagiarism in significant ways. "I cited the source" is not a def=
ense to an infringement lawsuit. The owner of a copyright does not want "cr=
edit", the owner of a copyright wants money. Fraud is a crime, but plagiari=
sm is not fraud. "Fraud consists of the intentional misappropriation or tak=
ing of anything of value which belongs to another by means of fraudulent co=
nduct, practices or representations." New Mexico Stat. Ann., =A7 30-16-6 (1=
987). The typical plagiarist does not obtain any money or thing belonging t=
o another for the plagiarized work. While a grade or honors might be someth=
ing "of value", it is not a thing of value "which belongs to another". Acad=
emic honors and degrees cannot be transferred to another person. Copyright =
can be transferred, and thus has a value in the marketplace.

Other values: Accuracy

Second, let's consider journalism. In journalism, accuracy is more valuable=
 than originality. Except in feature writing, the last thing you want to do=
 is imply that an idea is original with you. You might accurately quote and=
 diligently cite someone's opinion, but if you fail to check or corroborate=
 it, you have been dishonest to the reader. Just by including it in your re=
port, you imply that the source is credible and was corroborated.

Other values: Authority

Finally, in legal writing (or in academic writing, for that matter - pjh), =
the last thing you want to be is original. If an idea is new with you, and =
unsupported by legislation or precedent, it is worthless.

Apologies in advance for cross-posting]

There are some exciting changes in the next hypertext conference that bear
directly on our community. First, Hypertext 2004 is accepting submissions
in hypertext form for the very first time. I would expect the
ht_lit/cybertext/E-lit community to be especially receptive to this. For
specific details on hypertext submissions, please see

http://web14.cse.ucsc.edu/cfpHypertext.php

As you will see, Hypertext 2004 is organized for the first time around
explicit themes, of which one is literary hypertext. The lit end of the
hypertext community has produced some extremely strong papers in recent
years, and I'm hoping that fine tradition will be resurgent for 2004. As
the first year for literary hypertext being its own theme, I'm sure we can
produce a very strong showing. There is a huge amount of exciting research
work yet to be done in literary hypertext; I hope those of you who have
submitted in the past will submit again in 2004, and if you haven't
submitted to the hypertext conference before, we welcome new voices.

                              Hypertext 2004

           Fifteenth ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia
              August 9-13, 2004 : Santa Cruz, California USA
                           http://www.ht04.org/

                           Call for Submissions

  The Fifteenth International ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia
  will be held in Santa Cruz, California, August 9-13, 2004.

  The ACM Hypertext Conference is the foremost international conference
  on hypertext and hypermedia. It brings together scholars, researchers
  and practitioners from a diverse array of disciplines, united by a
  shared interest in innovative textual and multimedia information
  spaces - with emphasis on augmenting human capabilities via linking,
  structure, authoring, annotation and interaction.

  This year, in addition to the established conference themes, the
  conference is actively soliciting submissions at the intersections
  of hypermedia and Digital Libraries, Software Engineering and the
  Humanities. We welcome submissions on the representation, design,
  structuring, visualizing, navigating, and exploiting of the rich
  network of relationships found in these domains.

  Spatial hypertext (structuring information via visual cues and
  geometric arrangement) and ubiquitous hypermedia (in situ authoring
  and navigating relationships among real world objects) have recently
  emerged as significant research directions. They join our established
  themes of adaptive hypermedia, literary hypertext and systems and
  structures. This latter topic knits together the research themes
  of open hypermedia, structural computing, design and reflection.

  In a bold experiment, for the first time we will be accepting
  hypertext submissions of research results. We are keenly interested
  in how judicious use of nonlinear narrative and rich linking can
  enhance communication of research ideas. We encourage you to consider
  submitting your paper as a hypertext. Please see the Web site for
  further details about hypertext submission.

  We will also be operating a rolling review process. Papers and
  hypertexts received before the early submission deadline will receive
  reviewers' feedback at least a week before the final submission
  deadline, facilitating revised submissions where appropriate.

Key dates

  Early submission deadline: February 4, 2004
  Full papers & hypertexts:  March 12, 2004
  Workshop proposals:        December 19, 2003
  Short papers:              May 28, 2004
  Poster & demo abstracts:   June 11, 2004

Program Themes

  This year we have organised the call around a number of themes. We
  welcome papers about all aspects of hypertext and hypermedia, even
  if not closely fitting one of these themes.

Digital Libraries

  Chair John Leggett, Texas A&M University
  Vice Chair David Hicks, Aalborg University Esbjerg

  Information structuring plays a fundamental role in the broad range of
  research areas encompassed by the digital library field. The diverse
  collection of media that digital libraries contain, along with the
  variety of ways in which users interact with those resources, require
  flexible, dynamic, and adaptable structuring techniques. We seek
  contributions that explore the ways in which the rich variety of
  structuring facilities represented by hypermedia technology can be
  used to address the challenging tasks faced in the digital libraries
  field.

Software Engineering

  Chair Walt Scacchi, University of California, Irvine
  Vice Chair Ken Anderson, University of Colorado, Boulder

  Software projects produce a diverse set of highly interrelated
  artifacts including requirements, architectures, designs, source code,
  test cases, and build scripts. We are interested in research that
  explicitly leverage these relationships through hypertext mechanisms
  or capabilities, including but not limited to contributions in
  Web-based open source software development, software development
  environments, CASE tools, consistency checking, software configuration
  management, build management, release management, literate
  programming, intelligent editors, and documentation support systems.

Hypertext in the Humanities

  Chair Christiane Fellbaum, Princeton University
  Vice Chair Stuart Moulthrop, University of Baltimore

  Theoretical and applied work in areas like computational linguistics,
  natural language processing, lexical semantics, cognitive psychology,
  computer-mediated communication, and electronic publishing have
  explored the advantages of coding, storing, and accessing lexical
  and conceptual knowledge in multi-dimensional formats. We encourage
  submissions in these and related areas that show how multi-dimensional
  structure has been used to describe, represent, and explain different
  types of information.

Adaptive and Adaptable Hypermedia

  Chair mc schraefel, University of Southampton

  Individuals are, well, individual. In many scenarios, one text, one
  set of relationships, does not fit all readers. We seek contributions
  in all areas of this research theme, encompassing systems,
  methodologies, and user models for the adaptation, filtering and
  personalization of relationship-rich information spaces. Additional
  emphases include interaction design for adaptable or adaptive systems,
  adaptive and intelligent learning environments, recommender systems,
  reflective user models, and agent-based adaptation, as well as
  rigorous evaluation of such systems.

Literary Hypertext

  Chair Jim Rosenberg

  Viewed broadly, hypertext permits a wide range of experimentation in
  literary works on non-linearity, multiple authorial viewpoints, and
  rhetorical structure, as well as radical entanglements of words and
  meaning. Papers are welcomed on a variety of topics, of which only
  a small sample might include: the nature of hypertextual time,
  cybertext/algorithmic anatomy, hypertext narratology, hypertext
  anti-narratology, the role of code in literary hypertext, hypertextual
  close reading, literary interfaces, minimalist hypertext, maximalist
  (sculptural) hypertext, and the nature of hypertextual genre.

Ubiquitous Hypermedia

  Chair Kaj Gronbaek, Aarhus University

  Rich networks of relationships exist among physical real-world objects
  as well as between these objects and computerized documents. We seek
  contributions that explore the interface between the physical and the
  virtual, especially those emphasizing creation, visualization and
  navigation of relationships, content delivery to mobile devices,
  location tracking, authoring tools and methods for geospatial
  relationships, and innovative uses of this technology for work, play,
  and creative expression.

Spatial Hypertext

  Chair Frank Shipman, Texas A&M University

  The relative positioning of artifacts to create new relationships and
  meaning has long been used by sculptors and visual artists. Spatial
  hypertext builds on this tradition to assign meaning and structure to
  units of text and media based on their visual similarity and relative
  geometric and temporal placement in virtual information spaces. We are
  interested in contributions that explore this novel information
  structuring technique, including new systems, user interfaces and
  metaphors, visualizations, methodologies, experience reports, and
  spatial structuring techniques.

Systems and Structures

  Chair Niels Olof Bouvin, Aarhus University

  Now that the Web has entered a period of stabilization characterized
  by increased maturity and incremental technical improvement, we seek
  research on novel systems that expose possibilities far beyond the
  Web as we know it. We solicit contributions on innovative systems,
  methodologies, and taxonomies for representing and structuring
  intellectual work and its inter-relationships. Users of systems can
  range from individuals to collaborative teams, working free-form, or
  in defined workflows. Dimensions of interest include novel user
  interfaces, architectures, distribution, data models, infrastructure,
  standards, openness, and, generally, capabilities for augmenting
  creative intellectual activity.

Other topics

  Papers about all aspects of hypertext and hypermedia are welcome,
  whether or not they fit one or more of the above themes.

Submission categories

  Hypertext 2004 is seeking full papers and hypertexts, short papers,
  workshops, technical briefings, doctoral consortium contributions,
  demonstrations, and posters. Please see the Web site for further
  information.

Erik's a wonderful friend and his interest in poetry is direct.  He lavishes the amount of time he puts into Weigh Station, paying for it on his own hard earned cash (so far by back breaking labor in VT), selecting and ordering the contents as well as writing succinct prose such as the Villon piece.  A great example of the pleasure of a life in reading.  A life which reflects its world-surrounding circumstances, refusing the circumventing of them...  a wonderful talker, endless late-nights.

PUBLISHERS WEEKLY:
Putting 20 years of work into one intensely wrought luminously gripping book,
Artforum critic Barry Schwabsky here stages his Opera: Poems 1981-2002. His
approach to the eponymous form -- colloquial, lived-in, forking the vulgar
tongue, mixing in trailer park trash talk, throwing out references to
Wittgenstein, Larbaud and Traherne -- rises to the other-worldly.
Meritage Press, Small Press Distribution, 104 pages, ISBN 0970917929.


ADVANCE WORDS:
The word "song" resonates over and over and the poems here will often
suddenly burst into an intricate, complicated melody.
--Juliana Spahr

His poetry is exactly as strange as the familiar may permit. His work, born
of a strange encounter between American poetry and European masters such as
Celan and Novalis, always surprises me by its exploratory investigations. He
writes one of the most loving poetries today, filled with a sexual myth as strong
as anyone's.
--David Shapiro

These might be choruses and arias from some lost Venetian music drama of the
early 1600s--an allegory of the nature of light and of desire, set on one of
those abandoned islands where every imaginable encounter becomes
possible--transmuted over the intervening centuries of silence into a software program for a
new species of lyrical electronica.
--Geoffrey O'Brien

Imagine poems written by Sir Walter Raleigh after he has read Wittgenstein
and Lorine Neidecker, listened to bands whose names weren't in the air but whose
one song was on the airwaves, and learned more about contemporary art than
anyone thought possible, and you might get a sense of the compactness of these
poems, an airy abstract density unlike anyone else's.
--John Yau

i wish this retreat had been publicized...the topic is of great
urgency to many of us...what were the politics behind its
organization...oh yeah...just realized  a "retreat" rather than a
symposium or conference is a diff type of a thing, invitation only,
very small and intense. oh well.  and here comes the pitch: if you
all VOTE FOR ME for mla poetry division i will make sure to try to
put such topics on the agenda...btw for those of you who have
responded, "I AM NOT A NUT, ELECT ME" is the title of a lenny bruce
album.

btw some of your musings on p & e ron have been of great interest to
both of my classes this semester...

iduna by kari edwards, Poetry, 102 pages, ISBN # 1-882022-49-1, $12.00.=20

iduna is experiment in which the text (like a personality) is as if =
'set' to proceed by accident and mistakes of machine - but then, as =
such, in the workings of its 'accidents' (as if she is margins of pages =
and words from ads and 'theory' which are composing and revealing her: =
as if personality which is a machine/and thus the text is akin to the =
memory of a Replicant in Blade Runner) the effect is seeing =
passionate/'personal'/'emotional' (un)programmed memory and responses.

=20

Steve McCaffery says about iduna "If benign linearity marks the last =
vestige of Cartesian consciousness, Vitruvian space and Spinozan ethics, =
then iduna signalizes its catalectic adieu. For there is no return after =
this. Kari Edwards has written and conceived a bold, complex text that =
pushes lyricism to the brink of an interstice, between the Dictionary =
and its scream. Auto-translative, self-contaminatory, iduna never =
renounces its splendid linguistic excess, fabricating a textural world =
of legibility and illegibility, gravitation and non-gravitation, that =
powers its dweller (for one must dwell in iduna) gesturally around and =
among its morphs and torques. If Deleuze and Guattari are correct when =
they aver that writing 'has nothing to do with signifying. It has to do =
with surveying, mapping, even realms that are yet to come' then iduna =
provides a special map to a certain dream of Coleridge's: the frontiers =
of a post-cognitive." =20

=20

Johanna Drucker says about iduna "Paratexts and processing suggestions =
stream through Kari Edwards's iduna... The constant drive to make use of =
formal possibilities at the level of page and opening brings graphic =
format into substantive play...A machinic drive echoes in this work as a =
human, subjective voice struggles to come through the registers of =
current language events, noise, news, records, communications. The shape =
of a human outcry presses through the mass of mediated material. Form =
embodies possibilities enabled by the instructions of forced =
justification, font shifts, hard returns, tabs, chunked blocks, and =
other basic elements of text processing...Before we can ask what =
something means when we read it, we must ask what it means to read - and =
Edwards poses that as a high-stakes question providing the point of =
departure for current poetic production."=20

=20

Chris Tysh says about iduna "Having evacuated the endemic patriarchal =
script, Edwards writes hir own rules of the game in the wee hours when =
the sky turns green and binary logic decamps posthaste. Under the ruins =
of gender, iduna is a wild garden where 'sexuality begets language.' The =
anarchic profusion of voices, discourses, idiolects, fonts and =
typographies that seem to rain down upon the page becomes the new =
'formlessness' which is the political signature of this resistant and =
absorptive text." =20

"Mr. Bush spoke from a thatched-roof pagoda, especially crafted for the
occasion to give him and the Indonesian leader, Megawati Sukarnoputri, a
Balinese context even though they were on the edge of the island's
international airport.

American officials had deliberated for days over the exact spot for the
pagoda so that the cameras would capture a photo-perfect backdrop: the azure
blue Indian Ocean with gently cresting waves, two potted palms waving in the
breeze and tubs of flowers personally designed by the staff of Ms. Megawati,
who is a plant lover.

In the distance, American warships, especially diverted for Mr. Bush's
visit, patrolled the waters, and an extraordinary number of Secret Service
and other security officials patrolled the grounds of the airport hotel
where Mr. Bush held his official meetings."

Now available from La Alameda Press:

Equivalence (La Alameda Press, 2003)
6 x 9 88 pages
1-888809-41-8 $14.00 ( paperback )

Drawing its name from photographer Alfred Stieglitz's series of cloud
images, the poems in this collection from poet Shin Yu Pai explore
connections and correspondences between poetry and the visual arts, Eastern
and Western cultures, tradition and modernity, perpetual migration and the
sense of home. In the course of this exploration, the poet is inspired by
modern and contemporary artists such as Wolfgang Laib, Piet Mondrian, Joseph
Cornell, Yoko Ono, and Felix Gonzales-Torres.

"Shin Yu Pai's imagination is like a fine pottery bowl, delicately shaped
but capable of holding many things: playfulness, candor, descriptive
elegance. She is working out her own welcome blend of cultures, Eastern and
Western, and Equivalence is the lovely and often challenging
result."--Rosellen Brown

"Shin Yu Pai matches a painter's grasp of the materiality of things with the
poet's trick of arranging words for maximum musical effect. She knows that
in poetry it is the music that keeps in the mind what is seen. Her poems
honor their imagist heritage by making it new."--William Corbett

"Shin Yu Pai's voice is equal parts exciting, exuberant and elegant.
Equivalence serves as a profound dual act of grace and wisdom. This poet has
carved out a bold, wondrous space on our mountain, complete with unspeakable
vistas that stretch clear toward the earth's edge."--Jim Behrle

Equivalence received a 2003 grant from the Cambridge Arts Council and the
Massachusetts Cultural Council.


Shin Yu Pai is a Taiwanese-American poet and visual artist. Previous titles
include Ten Thousand Miles of Mountains and Rivers. She lives in Boston,
Massachusetts.

All is illusion, saith the prophet.

Methinks that aircraft carrier was also a set--one of those little models
used to simulate battles at sea in war movies. The water we saw was
actually in a tank on a Hollywood soundstage, and the characters and
action (including the President and his fly-in) were inserted by computer
during post-production.

there's a lot i could say here, but i don't even know where to start.

i stumbled upon elliott smith because i went to a mary lou lord show and he
was on the bill. it was a quick sell, hearing him sing about his troubles with
junk, love, really just life in general.

after that i saw him play whenever i could, including a poets' expedition with
maggie zurawski and ange mlinko to the since-closed Tramps on West 22nd Street
here in NYC; opening for Beck and Ben Folds Five at jones beach, where he had
his semi-regular backing band, Quasi's Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss, she also of
Sleater-Kinney; and new year's eve 1999 at the Knitting Factory, when he
yelled out at two minutes to 2000, "I need a two minute song," and I yelled
out "Say Yes," my favorite song of his, and he played it before bringing his
girlfriend on stage, counting off from 10, yelling happy new year, and
swigging from a just-popped bottle of champagne before passing it to us to
swig from.

if you don't know his music, pick something up, with my choices
being "either/or" or "elliott smith" if you want something sparse. If you want
something harder and a bit fuller and faster, his work with the band
Heatmiser, which also featured Coomes, is great. There I'd pick Mic City Sons.

it's a sad day on this end, even sadder than cobain really.

Kirby--

I completely agree that it would be interesting to hear from people working
at university presses on what their policies are.  With the caveat that, as
long as the presses can make authors of critical work seek out permission
themselves and pay any fees demanded (offloading both the hassle and the
expense), they have nothing to lose by requiring permission for every line.
It's by far the safest course for them.

I am a lawyer, but I don't work in copyright or intellectual property.  I
work for the Justice Department (federal), where I do appellate work, mostly
tax.  I also worked for several years for a federal judge and in law firms
doing a general practice.  Copyright is federal law, and it's all codified
in a complex statute  (the 1976 Copyright Act), so it has that much in
common with what I do everyday (also federal law and also codified), but
there obviously are some differences, too.  I have access to some good
research resources, and the thread intrigued me; also, I am doing some
translations myself and I was curious to find out what problems I might
encounter when I'm ready to publish.  Finally, I have a Ph.D. in Spanish and
Portuguese and have published six full critical articles in academic
journals without ever hearing that I had to get permission for quoting
material (and my field was the 20th century novel and short story of Latin
America, so the material wasn't in the public domain).  Still, I left
academia in the mid-1980's in search of a steady paycheck, so perhaps things
have gotten more cutthroat since then.

Incidentally, in the Europe "fair use" is called "fair dealing" and there's
a presumption that use of 40 lines or less from a poem (providing it's also
no more than 1/4 of the poem) is fair (in a work of criticism or a review).
Use of a longer excerpt may also be fair use, depending on the
circumstances.  You can find a discussion of this at
"www.societyofauthors.org/perms.htm" and at
"www.blackwellpublishing.com/authors/permission.asp."  So far, I haven't
found anything as useful on the web for U.S. publishers.  Apparently *The
Chicago Manual of Style* has a chapter on permissions, but I don't own a
copy.  It may parrot the presses' point of view, which may be over-cautious.

I agree that the poetry benefits from the widest possible discussion.  It's
a shame if people are intimidated by the mere possibility of lawsuits.  We
lawyers have a lot to apologize for!

Paula,  I too was terribly surprised to find out that I need permissions when I
went to publish my first book.  It was a shock.  I had published three or four
full articles in journals -- and nobody said a peep.  Then, suddenly, I had to
get permissions.  One poet said no, and was really mean about it!  I couldn't
understand why since I felt the article was fair and balanced and would rekindle
an interest in this largely forgotten poet's work.

However, no meant no to my publisher.  I checked around with five or six
critics, and all of them told me, too, that no means no.

Personally, I think it is appalling.

Can you find any cases in which poets have taken a critic to court on fair use
issues within the US?

It's great that you're a lawyer and are on this case.  I feel that we may get to
the bottom of this.

I assume that most copyright lawyers work in NYC where most publishing takes
place.  But very few NYC publishers will publish poetry much less criticism.  So
we're dealing with University presses, all of whom appear to have this idea of
permissions (I'm generalizing from the three that I have dealt with).

I think if we could find a sound precedent of any kind we could repeal this
problem.

But right now yes presses make you get permission, and pay for it (this has
always come out of my department's budget) but one poet said simply no, not at
any price.  So that killed an entire chapter that was going to press and nearly
killed the book.

Probably no University press even wants to risk setting foot in a court.

Could a critic indemnify themselves, if that's the word, and agree to take on
all the legal issues resulting from a book's publication as part of their
contract and free a press from having to deal with it?  I think even there the
book might have an injunction against it so that even if the author was liable
the press would also be hurt financially.

I thank you so much for anything you can do to help to clarify this matter.

Forthcoming in November from Flood Editions

BLACK DOG SONGS by Lisa Jarnot

    ISBN 0-9710059-9-0
    Price: $13.00

Black Dog Songs is Lisa Jarnot's third volume of poetry. Decidedly lyrical,
these poems move through pastures and politics to the quick of thought.
What emerges is a catalog of loves and laments: "Just the eldergrass and him,
the fog, unpoliced and safe inside the train, the thoughts of rain, Apollo,
and the sun . . ."

"Gertrude Blake pirouettes in a fun house of auditory mirrors: one reflects
WILL BE become wOZ; another a lamb post-suffrage; in a third The Blues
remember hills. Through a mirage of defensible oases in Mother Goose light
words swap parts and dance as Churchill's cloud wanders down attracted by
the music." - Tom Raworth

"I find there's always the act of source implicit in her language. However
adrift
in linguistic aesthetics, in sheer music-of-rhythmed-sounds, her words are
never severed from the means that engendered them; and the consequent
meanings
are never detached from the meditative drama of each whole poem." - Stan
Brakhage

This interview in the current issue of VeRT is particularly good and rings
out to me in very particular ways. Originally from "Coyote" a Brazilian
journal that has many fine points, some concerning recent issues presented
here.

 http://www.litvert.com/issue9.html

 Here's an excerpt
Q: How do you see the world and the United States after September 11th and
the war on Iraq? What can poetry do in a world that is increasingly becoming
violent, complex and unpredictable? Is poetry still necessary, or even a
necessary discourse?

KJ: I have my outward positions, of course, and like most people, I like to
sound like I know what I'm talking about. But like most people, too, I'm
very uncertain about what the world is or where it may be headed. And it
seems to me that poetry must resist the temptation to assume a defining
"mission" or "role" in these times when we are all hungering for firmer
bearings. Perhaps what we need to do, as poets, is plug our deepest recesses
into that great and encompassing uncertainty, fear, paradox, and, yes, dark
comedy of the current conjuncture and just see what happens. Allow our
selves to be shocked and lit up by the horror. To be transformers, as it
were. Needless to say, there are as many cords and plugs as there are snakes
in Medusa's head; and there are as many open outlets as there are orifices
in Hades. So while we must be bold, we need also, I suppose, to be careful
and have the polished shield handy!

So I guess I'm saying I'm not sure that poetry can or should aspire to "do"
anything, really. To the extent that poetry does do work beyond its general
aesthetic circumference, it seems to do so most meaningfully when it remains
steadfastly what it most "politically" is: an autonomous zone of spirit and
conscience, a zone that should be understood by those who enter it as
multifarious and many-guised, beholden to no ideology of politics or art.
Oppen and Zukofsky were onto something not yet sufficiently explored when
they talked about sincerity as the ground of the art. Too easy to dismiss
the concept as a sentimental cliché; harder to view and follow one of its
countless paths waiting there.

Auden writes in his elegy for Yeats,

For poetry makes nothing happen: it survives
In the valley of its making where executives
Would never want to tamper, flows on south
From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs,
Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,
A way of happening, a mouth.

Perhaps in moments of crisis like we are now in, powerful poetry may reveal
the connections of the "political" to that mysterious "mouth" Auden evokes.
Maybe one could say that the poet's "political" task is to show how the
"Real" is never separate from that dark space. But, well, I guess you can
see that I am struggling with this answer!

I like the admonition against reducing poetry to a political "position,"
but on the other hand, I'm less sure about the suggestion that we should
"allow our selves to be shocked and lit up by the horror."  As that reads
to me, it seems we might run the danger of falling for a kind of facile
poetic sensation or excitement (though who *doesn't* like a little
sensation and excitement in a poem?).  And since Kent quoted Oppen I will
too: "They await / War, and the news / Is war / As always / That the juices=
 may flow in them / Tho
the juices lie."  Yes, even though they can feel so powerful, so true, so
damn poetic, the juices lie.  That's the problem with the adrenaline rush
(I might call it the Baraka problem, but that's another argument) and
perhaps also the trouble with getting all goose-bumpy and  "lit up by the
horror."

For a source-- Micah Ballard's recent study on the Wieners/Keats connection via Negative Capability: NEGATIVE CAPABILITY IN THE VERSE OF JOHN WIENERS (Auguste Press, 2001)
... the section titled "The Temple of Maiden Thought" or possibly the next titled "The Night Palace", would certainly offer forth passages to "jump start" ideas.  A great read and ideal launching point.

It should be available direct: Auguste Press 659 fillmore #4 SF, CA 94110.

I just had the delight - dare say felt like a privilege - to see the opening
of Revelations, the Diane Arbus retrospective at the SF MOMA. Wow!
Forget any cheap Sontag "freak" cheap-shot dismissal of the work - that one
which has unfortunately framed a stereotypical response to its body and
significance for the past 30 years. This show - I assure -  will undo every
pre-text and take "one" to another, well not another, but right back to
"this" plain/plane, one (from the most public to the most private) which is
quite full enough, looking, so deeply and clearly and presenting it, quite
straight ahead, as she, Arbus, does.

Here until February, eventually the show goes to LA and the NY Met -
transcending the mid-continent (too bad).

Arbus is also a very good writer - as I suspect the new book will attest.

"Nudists aren't purists. Occasionally they feel the impulses to step into
something more comfortable."

Blown away, clearly,

Tibetan boy able to recite world's longest poem after dream

Wed Oct 22, 9:23 AM ET


BEIJING (AFP) - A 13-year-old Tibetan schoolboy has miraculously
memorized large parts of the world's longest poem after having had a
mysterious dream.


Sitar Doje, a fifth-grader from Qamdo prefecture, had his dream two
years ago and can now recite "The Life of King Gesar" for up to six
hours on end, the Xinhua news agency reported Wednesday.


The agency says Tibet has a long tradition of people waking from sleep
inexplicably able to recite the poem from memory.


Most of these "God-taught Masters", however, are much older than Sitar
Doje and are usually illiterate, the agency said.


The lengthy 1,000-year old epic is also cherished by Mongolians and has
given rise to a whole field of study referred to as "Gesarology", Xinhua
said.

The Welfare Poets are a collective of activists, educators, and artists
together since 1990. Through teaching residencies and workshops, through
activism around community struggles and through sharp-edged performances
of music that incorporates Hip Hop, Bomba y Plena, Latin Jazz and other
rhythms, the Welfare Poets bring information and inspiration to those
facing oppression and those fighting for liberation.

David, I thought to send something about this myself, I felt quite dejected when
I heard about it last night from my friend and colleague Wendy Walters (her
husband, turns out, was/is a huge Elliott Smith fan).  I liked his music,
sometimes alot, sometimes finding him a bit angsty for my taste.  What I
thought of immediately (as I'm sure many did) was the suicide scene in Wes
Anderson's "The Royal Tennenbaums" in which Luke Wilson cuts his hair, shaves
his beard and then slashes himself to pieces while Smith's "Needle in the Hay"
plays.  In a movie which was (by the standards of Rushmore and Bottle Rocket,
say) something of a mixed bag, that's a stunning scene, not least for the way
it portrays the decision to commit suicide as 1 part inner turmoil and 1 part
nonchalance.  "He's acting dumb, that's what you've come / to expect."  -m.

Thanks for these replies. Sorry I was out of touch and miss it. It seems
that virginity seems to add some kind of tension to passion that excites the
romantic imagination. I think of Keats and he idealizes his desire and that
seems to crank him up quite a bit.

In reading Albert Gelpi's essay of 1990, "The Genealogy of Postmodernism:
Contemporary American Poetry" at
http://www.english.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/gelpi.html,
I notice a reference to "Nick Piombillo's 'Writing as Reverie'..." And I
wish to know if "Piombillo" is a typo for "Piombino."

Can it be there is more than one "Nick Piombi*o" interested in contemporary
poetry? It is like discovering an Arielle Greenbelg.

In Greek myth Hades the lord of the underworld had a cap of invisibility.   William Burroughs wore that cap, I think.  He used to talk about means of becoming invisible. He said somewhere that going through NYC and watching out for bad elements and people you didn't want to see, you just had to see them first, and then you
just imagined that you were invisible, and you were.  He also said to wear the most average clothes in soft shades of gray in order to slip through the city unseen.

1. New Movie Reviews: A Mystery of Language and Murder
By A. O. SCOTT

Frannie (Meg Ryan), the heroine of Jane Campion's "In the=20
Cut," is a writer and teacher who collects curious scraps of=20
language: pungent specimens of slang, wayward metaphors,=20
provocative jargon. When a homicide detective on the trail of=20
a serial killer describes the body of a murder victim as=20
"disarticulated," Frannie's ears perk up. She jots the word=20
down in a notebook and  later on pesters him for a precise=20
definition.

The word is a euphemism for something appropriately grisly,=20
the results of which occasionally flash before Frannie's=20
eyes, and ours, as this atmospheric exploration of sexual=20
need and urban paranoia unfolds. But it might also describe=20
the movie itself, which is a disjointed, sometimes=20
fascinating m=E9lange of moods, associations and effects. The=20
story turns out to be fairly conventional, with an end that=20
is a stale pretzel bowl of surprise twists, and the=20
psychology of the characters can be frustratingly obscure,=20
but there are nonetheless images and ideas that stick like=20
splinters under your skin.

Ms. Campion ("The Piano," "The Portrait of a Lady") is an=20
inveterate navigator of the murkier zones of female=20
sexuality, and "In The Cut," adapted from Susanna Moore's=20
novel, plots a hazardous nexus of dread, danger and desire.=20

Thanks Mike and David for your posts on Elliott Smith.  It's hit me
pretty hard too, much harder than your run of the mill celebrity drug
death.  (Mike, I think that Tennenbaum image gets it exactly right).  I
guess in part because Elliott seemed to have in music everything I once
thought I wanted in poetry--assurance of his talent, respect rather than
than bald fame or notoriety, sympathetic fans who were willing to let
him change.  I'm with David in thinking it's sadder somehow than
Cobain's death;  you can see how that life could be miserable.

I wonder if there's something 'generational' about all this that's got
me so depressed?  That Smith grew up in the heavy shadow of the '60s was
more and more clear from those (to my ear) overblown Dreamworks records
(I wanted to say something glib like Dreamworks killed him, but then on
the radio I heard they'd spearheaded several interventions.  Protecting
the product, I know, but also a fairly decent thing to do if it's
true).  Also, like a lot of indie 'stars' he seemed to have a hard time
taking the spotlight.  I saw him at the Fillmore just when "Figure 8"
came out and he was like a wax mannikin--other than the songs, not much
more than a goofy wave and a wispy "thanks. goodnight."  His death seems
on one level like a response to the problem of growing up in the
backwash of the baby boom; having a lot of the same ideals, but not
enjoying the same stage to enact them on.   I wouldn't want to push that
too hard, but it did add to some of the poignancy of his suicide for me.

I got to see Anne Tardos and Jackson MacLow read in Berkeley last
night.  Driving to the reading I heard a solid block of Smith songs on
KALX, so the contrast was very much on my mind.  MacLow seemed so alive,
aware, open, in love with Anne.  There's the artist I'd hope to be, the
indie star who makes it past 80.

Rivera Strikes Again

Sunday October 26, 2003

Bowery Poetry Club

8pm


The Bowery Poetry Club is the site of a literary invasion by four Puerto

Rican writers, all of whom bear the surname Rivera. Beginning at 8pm, on
Sunday,

October 26, 2003, the program, RIVERA STRIKES AGAIN!, cuts across both
poetry

and prose to present a landscape of literature and activism by writers
who
have

made their mark upon New York City's cultural scene. Armed with books,
CDs,

and lasting reputations, the featured writers include performance poet
Hector

Luis Rivera, poet/essayist Louis Reyes Rivera, freelance journalist and

novelist Lucas Rivera, and critic/educator Raquel Z. Rivera, offering a
full
evening

of performance and open dialogue.


Hector Luis Rivera, co-founder of The Welfare Poets, a collective of

musicians and poets that incorporates Hip Hop with Bomba, Plena and
Latin
Jazz, has

been writing and performing his work for the past 12 years. His poetry
was

included in Nancy Nuevez's theatrical production of Blind Alley, and in
Taller

Boricua's 30th Anniversary exhibition. Known for his activism in
community

struggles around housing, environmental justice, police brutality,
political

prisoners, and most recently, in the battle for Vieques, Hector Luis
continues to

perform original works while serving as an educator in several New York
City

schools.


Award-winning poet/essayist Louis Reyes Rivera has been a mainstay in

cultural activism for well over thirty years. Among his more recent
credits
are Bum

Rush The Page: A Def Poetry Jam (Crown Publishers, 2001), co-edited with
Tony

Medina, and his own Scattered Scripture, winner of the 1997 Latino
Writers

Institute Award for Poetry. A professor of Creative Writing,
African-American,

Nuyorican, Caribbean literature and history, Louis has worked in Jazz
clubs
and

festivals with The Sun Ra All-Stars Project, Ahmed Abdullah's Diaspora,
and

with his own band, The Jazzoets, which is regularly featured at Sistas'
Place
in

Brooklyn. He appeared on the Peabody award-winning HBO show, Def Poetry
Jam,

and can be heard every Thursday, at 2pm, on WBAI (99.5 FM) hosting
Perspective.



Lucas Rivera is a freelance journalist-turned novelist, who has worked
with

investigative reporter Jack Anderson, and whose articles have appeared
in
Urban

Latino, Vibe, Village Voice, Brooklyn Bridge and New York Daily News,
among

others. His articles on the Latin Kings involved more than six years of

research in between such other assignments as the World Trade Center
bombing,
the war

in Nicaragua, the Bhopal disaster in India, and the earthquake in Mexico

City. The Lucky Street Chronicles is his first novel, in which Lucas
captures
the

essence of Spanish Harlem at a time when crack was first introduced into

Communities of Color.


Raquel Z. Rivera has made her impact as a major critic of Hip Hop and

contemporary literature. The author of New York Puerto Ricans from the
Hip
Hop Zone

(Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), Raquel is currently a professor at the
Department

of Africana and Puerto Rican/Latino Studies at Hunter College. Her
studies of

Hip Hop and Puerto Rican culture has resulted in articles covering the

evolution of Caribbean musical expression, such as Puerto Rican bomba,
m**sica
j**bara,

plena, as well as Dominican palos and salves, reflecting both the
indigenous

and African roots of that music. In addition, her articles, stories and
poetry,

published in numerous newspapers, journals and anthologies, have
contributed

much to such topics as race and ethnic relations, gender issues, Puerto
Rican

national identity, and cross-Caribbean cultures. A founding member of
Puerto

Rican music group yerbabuena, she is currently a member of the
all-women‚Äôs

music collective Yaya, dedicated to exploring traditional Boricua and
Dominican

music.


The Bowery Poetry Club is located at 308 Bowery, near Bleecker Street (#
6 to

Bleecker or F train to Second Ave.). RIVERA STRIKES AGAIN! begins at
8pm,

with a $7 donation at the door. Autographed copies of books and CDs will
be

available for sale. For more information, contact Bowery Poetry Club at

212-614-0505, or Louisreyesrivera@aol.com.

The English printing act of 1662 lapsed in 1695, when the Parliament
could not reach consensus regarding a new law of the same spirit.
This was the end of pre-publication censorship in England, and many
politicians then tried to find some other means to control the flow
of printed information. Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, was among
those who worked hardest to achieve some new sort of regulation,
especially of newsprint.

In 1703 Harley saw to it that Daniel Defoe was released from prison.
Defoe argued in articles (commissioned by Harley) for a "moderately"
free press, and suggested a law that demanded that the names of the
author, printer and bookseller appeared on all printed matter. Thus
offenders could more easily be traced. At the same time Defoe says
that such a law would "put a stop to a certain sort of thieving which
is now in full practice in England, and which no law extends to
punish, viz. some printers and booksellers printing copies none of
their own." ("An Essay on the Regulation of the Press", 1704).

There had for long been a tight link between censorship and copyright
(the old non-statutory license model) and Defoe proposed a kind of
combination of the two where the author's individual responsibility
and protection against unlawful reprinting were included. At this
time there was a big problem among London booksellers to counter the
competition from rural sellers/printers. A bookseller or printer
aspiring after exclusive publishing rights had to have a clearly
defined contracting party, and now the author arose as candidate.
Thus, the view of intellectual property was finally focused upon the
actual creator of the intellectual content, there was much talk about
the "encouragement of learning" etc, a phrase that even found its way
into the title of the Queen Anne act.

There was not primarily a big concern for the authors that gave rise
to the act, but obviously the parties involved found this to be the
best compromise. Actually, the phrasing in the earlier drafts of the
law was more focused on the author than was the case in the final
code. This is the preamble with one of the omitted passages marked
with **:


     Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other Persons, have
     of late frequently taken the Liberty of Printing,
     Reprinting, and Publishing, or causing to be Printed,
     Reprinted, and Published Books, and other Writings,
     without the Consent of the Authors * thereof, in whom
     ye undoubted Property of such Books and Writing as the
     product of their learning and labour remains or of such
     persons to whom such Authors for good Consideracons
     have lawfully transferred their Rights and the title
     therein is not only a real discouragement to learning
     in generl which in all Civilized Nations ought to
     recieve ye greatest Countenance and Encouragement; but
     it is also a notorious Invasion of ye property of ye
     rightful * or Proprietors of such Books and Writings,
     to their very great Detriment, and too often to the
     Ruin of them and their Families [...]

I have uploaded the text of the Queen Anne Act in facsimile here:
http://www.copyrighthistory.com/anne.html

A good account for the advent of this act is John Feather's article
"The book trade in politics: The making of the copyright act of 1710"
(Publishing History 19 (8): 31-36, 1980) from which I quoted the
omitted passage above.

Matt Gonzalez is SF's Green Candidate for Mayor (among some other good
choices)

Matt's distinction for poets is that he's actually a serious reader, and
reads and befriends real poets here in the City. So, I suspect, Matt will
end up being good for the arts, particularly the Art of Poetry and its neve=
r
very generous embrace by City Hall. I have also found Matt good on many
other issues.

The Reading:=20
Caf=E9 Royale
800 Post Street (at Leavenworth)
7:30 PM Saturday, October 25 - that's tomorrow/

Kim Addonizio, George Evans, Gloria Frym, David Meltzer, Alkejandro Murguia=
.
Don Paul. Barbara Reyes, Stephen Vincent, Daisy Zamora, & others

Matt Gonsalez will speak. If you are a local SF poet, it's probably a good
time to meet him and talk up your concerns for ways in which the City can
generously serve and honor the Muse and all of her loyal servants (that's u=
s
and our work!).=20

If you can, see you there,

Esteemed Mairead,

Triplication is a new one; we had thought you were hesitant only
about your possible duplication.

On all matters of self-triplication and Invisibility Suits, apply (in
quadruplicate) to:

The Paracelete,
C/o The Blessed Trinity
Heaven
The Universe

As for duplication, we are hoping shortly to appoint a Merchandising
Manager to your delightful area, named after hens. This brief delay
is due to the unfortunate simultaneous resignation of Padre Pio in
the recent past.

Be assured that we intend to maintain the service so well expressed
in our Company Motto, authored by Sir John Boyle O'Reilly (it was no
fault of his he was an Irishman) in the British House of Commons in
the early 19th Century, when "he regretted he was not a bird, and
could not be in two places at the one time."

Meanwhile, look after yourself (an activity made very much less
painful by a visit from one of our sales team, which is guaranteed to
leave you beside yourself),

Yours in fellowship,

Rank Xerox Inc.

Karl-Erik -- This was a rich and fascinating document.  Also, your info about
Defoe and the police procedures of being able to track down the perpetrator of any
odcument in exchange for the commercial rights -- an interesting compromise.  This
whole struggle over rights and the idea of personal property of such a fragile
thing as a poem -- and its tensions -- I'm getting quite a bit out of the
conversation, but feel the whole history must now be uncovered -- from Defoe
forward.  But who knows the history, especially as it pertains to poetry?  I think
no one, and that it is waiting to be written, and that whoever wrote it would be
dangerous as they could slant it in almost any given direction and no one could
challenge them.

Back to the great men theory of history here with Defoe -- he was responsible for
so much!  The introduction of all kinds of policing, as I recall, is traceable to
him.

Another figure that I know next to nothing about however.  Why was he such a nut
about policing and security and so clever about putting the processes into motion?

All that's interesting, but I'd rather stay focused on the contemporary issues of
copyright concern as they involve poets and their critics, and am still hoping
that Paula Speck or one of her friends will kick over a stone with Yvor Winters'
name on it, and we'll have the origin of this problem in as clear a document as
you have here exposed, with all judgments and comments upon the original judgment
attached.  Again, I think this document is waiting to be compiled, and again it
will be a dangerous person who compiles it, because they will probably be able to
create it all practically without a single competitor.

Subject:      William Fuller next week (in Chicago)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

-Chicago Review-
is pleased to announce
a reading and lecture by


WILLIAM FULLER


Thursday, October 30
Reading
Classics 10 | 5:30 pm
[reception will follow]


Friday, October 31
"Restatement of Trysts" [lecture]
Wieboldt 408 | 1:00 pm


Drawing equally on Buddhist sutras and country blues,
William Fuller's latest book, -Sadly- [Flood, 2003],
derives compassion from its ironic vision. Quick and
sometimes elusive, his poems observe fluctuations in
economic markets, the weather, and human consciousness.
In the -Chicago Tribune- Maureen McClane has described
Fuller's "dense, elliptical meditations," writing that
his "luminous images ... consitently marry the cerebral
and the sensual." Fuller lives and works in Chicago.



nb: Classics and Weiboldt are best accessed
from 59th Street just east of Ellis.

my first hint of this came when I ran a search on a name on Amazon (having, as
so often, forgotten the title I was looking for) and discovered that Amazon now
provides a veritable citation index -- In addition to showing you the available
works of the author, they now show you works that cite that author -- a quick
glance at my own name shows they're doing a better job than most bibliographies
and citation indices I use professionally --

I couldn't open the link that Ron sent, but I saw this bizarre new thing where they even list
references to my work in sentences within other books!  It's astounding.  Is this an attempt to get
more people to look at their site by using it as a reference?  I wasn't sure what copyright issues
are at stake here, but I find it all rather Frankensteinian -- a freaky development to say the
least.

Subject: Alan's exe files

god.exe

flat roofed and sundrenched.  a vagina multiplies on the horizon, towering
the apartment blocks.  several clitori in hazy blue and hillock green, this
could be earth, the urethra shows water.  white lips vernix perspective.

abyss.exe

(large)
everything is forked, the two women, the tree, the pipes on the bag, snaked
tongued ribbons from the staff, the contentment.  the nipple staged as round
singularity, an event horizon.

america.exe

9/11 date floss, wrackish angle of the building, flagged, marked like a
leaning gravestone.  hysteria panic worm advances, burgeons, a burst
collective bowel pools, layers of screaming distress morph to hard edged
white noise.

archaea

moulded geology spikes out thrusts, except for, except for the ungilded
entrance, sleek and smooth.  from stage right epileptic modulation
progresses, an evolutionary  alzheimers.  furrows could be browed or
ploughed, perhaps a luddite loom or a roll top that's found the edge to
infinity.

archaea2.exe.

fungus.  the white glides across the screen like a slow dance with a knife
in its hand, obliterating.  bark pictures swing furiously, the door shows
there's always more behind than in front.  i can see how they built
pyramids.

archaea3.exe

look me in the eye, through condensation of convention and steam of
subconsious.  turn the dial and the radio will tune in to vascillating
opinions, see them pattern on their sides, rigid, repeating rhythm, pale
cyclical manifestation, this way, that way, a game of tennis with no balls.
BUT, as it progresses, the frontier is being pushed.

archaea4.exe

angular hole, darkness inside.  the reach across is a child's fingers, eager
to poke, push and explore.  perhaps though an old face, folded, a gaping
mouth, the intrusion as shadow of death, until it covers and ensures a final
silence.

archaea5.exe

the ovum right of centre.  spermatozoa flicking down the screen,
anhomogenous flow.  the edge is serated, to know a bread knife cut. reaching
the bottom of the screen a shark fin dives.  vertical marching pillar, the
edge of jackboot legs.

one blue dot.

archaea6.exe

tree gap lake.  something sets as slowly lids fall shut, but out of the
corner the point shuffles forwards.  white flicking lines, the consumption
of the spider wrapping
it's prey in white threads until completely entombed and then consumed, the
seeming full blankness at the close, and then the command.

archaea7.exe

boiler, harsh lines, spikey, like eletrical cable that snaps
and flicks white voltage, but also in some ways like those funny thread
pictures that people make of yaght sails with nails.  the spaces between
bursts was unpredicatable, a
vicious thrashing, but perhaps that was the rivetting behind that lent a
certain eloquent malevolence.  disappeared with no end prompt, to leave a
certain sense that it had stopped, like electricity and industry just does,
tripped out rather than switched.

archaea8.exe

wounded blue heron, intensity, colour vibration.  snow white coverage,
flakes as cells, graphically and  biologically, a gentle burial.  decaying
black, life transmogrified into colourless data, where there was everything,
now there is nothing.

archaea9.exe

a finger print of ever decreasing circles.  a projection of earth and water.

aus.exe

severe - but nothing happened.

axis.exe

turbine, lightglow on shredding.  axis<>restart, kill axis ok.  evil and
then the computer crashed.

baby.exe

shocked and wide eyed as the white saws cross for the coffin to be made.
mirrored through time, facets of everything, obliteration moves like the
stampede of tiny feet, and then repetition, of children in speech and the
work to keep them, and then childish, watching the clouds join up or
thinking of how the continents split.  techtonic.

ballet.exe

hard wired look away, a pirouette frankenstein, but that is you, not her.
she smears to decomposing doll, the heart rate monitor freezes and she is
sawn in half before becoming a monet tapestry, refracted then disappears.

bee.exe

glory, holy holy, a biological upthrust, smooth, wreathed like the green
man.  and then the black onyx, at the heart, the untouchable self, an
expansion to obsidian, a scrying, a castration of phallus, ever increasing
circles.  at first a button and false hallejulah disrupts into a shouted
obscured jehova.  black turns to brown, button becomes plate, then bowl as
depth of concentric circles fools the eye.  it creeps like propaganda,
becoming one thing and then another, until a maelstrom of your god and my
god and their god is an endless vortex.

blood.exe

nakes to the bones.  blood as a string of fairy lights around the heart
dancing.

brilliant.exe

trumpeted, oh brilliance, sounds out it's own future, as a shadow of post
apocolypse negativises all achivement.  the opera of the damned.

gb.exe

benevolence bearded, silk lasoos become rolls of barbed wire, gentleness
slashed by geometry.

glory.exe

scaleish music, brown parchment religion, He, He, He, covered quickly by
plasticised technology.  desire to scratch the surface, to return to what
was before, the old reliable of bended knees and prostration.  sacrifice
replaced by circular arguments.

graph.exe

woven, looped, visual feel of cobbed corn and pomegranates.  lines strike
forward while individuals jostle at stage left.  we click to advance, as
more space is filled it appears things move slower, there is no room to see.

hemiptera.exe

organic focus is stabbed by a spotlight of vertiginous hold.  a face
appears, with a beak, it would speak but for the incessant noise.

hemiptera2.exe

perhaps beetles, technolgy intrudes like a scream.

hemiptera3.exe

beauty and fragility clings to a tree while the blind worm consumes, leaving
nothing but black and absence in the final analysis.

hold.exe

wide open, to see, to read, to record, but with the screen the carriage
returns, in sepia, like an old typewriter.

kali.exe

crumpled, disgarded, but once activated she can run circles round you with
the occasional lightening flash.

mourning.exe

catacombs, sarcophagi, stacked in blood, attacked by words and the agressive
feature force that takes the space.

numb.exe

she lies with nipples in her eyes while the numbers compute.

numb2.exe

stripped like film.

numb3.exe

and now obliterated by the frentics.

numb4.exe

the colloseum steps disappear under the digital tourists.

overlook.exe

white ether forms reclines in what could be her shadow, until white noise
makes them organs together.

pest.exe

micro and radio, coming through the air, unseen and deadly, waves of
nauseatic abuse disrupt the horizon.

pest2.exe

and that's the point, they're everywhere, we can't escape, we are targetted
by default of our dwelling.

plasma1.exe

wavebreak, infinite molecules, linked and moving.

rust.exe

slat, stattern, rhomboid, rhumatoid arthritic cells.

scler.exe

geology, not always or forever but time expanded.  our bodies daily, once
grown, are almost static.  to us familiar.  but there are ice ages, drastic,
or cancer, fatal, rapid onsets, magma and plasma.

sks.exe

a nebulus scan, a history in two parts, physics meets infinity.

sks2.exe

child frozen for silicon life form, the future points but does not reach.

star.exe

look to space, not always outer, not for secrets, but to see beyond.  a star
is born is not necessarily about celebrity.  the womb expands, like when the
idea for lightbulbs was just a mere abstracted desire and candles were our
limit for thousands of years.

swoon.exe

her careless legs and granite umbilicus.  arousal spatters the screen in the
shape of her stockings.

tz.exe

heidegger no kant honestly flickers through a tired eye as the debris after
the fact becomes obscured by burgeoning philosophies.

umb.exe

the apple arse blossoms into petals of numbers.  math is possibility.

umb2.exe

green bulbous meat, well hung and fragrant tasty.

victor.exe

libidinal shyness is stapled into our consciousness.  there are always
lines, which ones to cross is a matter of choice.

void.exe

she has slipped behind.  reflective she stands inanimate in action.

wall.exe

there is nothing except the box, always the framing and the tools to change
what you have.

wallvoid.exe

when something is lost  you find something else to cling to.

weather.exe

sometimes in life it snows, as ever, before trains.

word.exe

there are rabbits running and dropped stitches.

word2.exe

in the shade to big fat lines of coke.  redo feeds the ad/diction.

I am getting old, tho I don't want to.


I am an American fighter in the Irak War, Sergeant Sang-sa.
I am not a Sang-sa, I am a Chung-sa.
Were you once a Pyong-chang?
Yes, but then I was a Ha-sa.
A Warrant officer or Chun-wi is not a warrant.
Corporal Sang-tung-byong?
That is not my name, but my rank.
Are there other Sang-tung-byong?
Yes, there are other Sang-tung-byong.
That is all, Corporal Sang-tung-byong.
Thank you, but Sang-tung-byong is not my name.
Are you called Sang-tung-byong?
Perhaps I am called Sang-tung-byong Corporal.
Is Corporal your name?
No, I do apologize, but Corporal is not my name.
Were you an I-tung-byong, Private?
I am not a Private, I am a Corporal.
Is a Corporal a Private 1st class?
No, a Corporal is not a Private 1st class, because a Corporal is
Sang-tung-byong, and a Private 1st class is Il-tung-byong.
Were you ever a Petty Officer?
Il, I, Sam, Il, I, Sam.
I am the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
I am called Yon-hap Ch'am-mo Ch'ong-chang and I am in charge of everyone
in America.
Are you in charge of a Company Commander?
I am in charge of a Company Commander, that is to say, a Chung-dae-chang,
and a Chung-dae-chang and I have made a flank attack, that is to say, a
ch'uk-myon kong-kyok in an offensive, that is to say, a kong-se.
Did this occur during the hu-myon kong-kyok, that is to say a rear attack?
As the Yon-hap Ch'am-mo Ch'ong-chang or Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, I made sure this occurred with the proper sa-gi or martial spirit
when I made a rear attack during the hu-t'oe or withdrawal.
Did you wear a helmet?
As an American Join Chief of Staff Chairman, I wore a helmet or ch'ol-mo.
Did you use a torpedo or o-roe?
Of course I did not use the o-roe in a demilitarized zone or bi-mu-chang
chi-dae.
Did you not use the torpedo or o-roe during a chak-chon or operation?
I did not and I did not have a torpedo or o-roe?
You did not have a torpedo or o-roe?
Not even the Ch'ong-sa-ryong-gwan or Commander-in-Chief has an o'roe?
Not even the Yon-hap Ch'am-mo Ch'ong-Chang or Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff?
Not even the Yon-hap Ch'am-mo Ch'ong-Chang.
Look, a rainbow or mu-ji-gae!

I could not agree more, at least half of me could not agree more, the other
half has some questions swirling around the sink hole of these
propositions-- That is, I think it may due, in a pinch, to say that each
"side", where we to give the political "spectrum" with in the USA "sides",
that each, left er right, is an exhibit, unto the other, of a preternatural
psychodrama, wherein the other is "lit up" by its own horror, which it
imagines exists via the other, toward what is "actually going on." And here
we met up with the comment, perhaps playfully given, by Kent Johnson, when
he states,"I like to sound like I know what I'm talking about." Here we mee=
t
ourselves again, like ghosts-- headless horsemen on this hallows eve-- and
are lit up by our recognition of that horror, which as a living and
breathing specimen should exist, if we are not at last merely managers of
the emotive margins we neither adequately understand or control.

That was David Kirchenbaum I believe. Let us not have these personal attacks
responded to on a solely fiirst-name basis. When I got the second note
generated by this affair, from Kari,,  could not tell whom she thought was
to blame. Well it was not me, because I would never lower MM's slef-esteem

George Kalamaras
Borders My Bent Toward

The Sense of Lost


It was the sense of lost.  An evening
of hurt hard enough to stop the begin.
He knew it, felt it in the human urge
to speak what sulfur might backlash

his bit.  Right now, for a moment
though, he might hold it off.  The way
the evening sun slants a shadowless.
But oh, for once maybe the past

might tense up again as if tensing
toughened a fist his throat might
swallow, no, gulp down knuckle brown
to rye.  A gallop in his heart heard.

A lightning split across his eye.
Should he felt it?  Bay at it?  Blink
his massive eyelash as feathery salve?  Feel
it urge again and find the missing

shape shaping there what was and might
still?  For it could become.  But
it was over, is over, he knew
it, hoped it might sure in his tongue

tonguing bits of spilled saliva, sun-dried
tomato pesto, flecks of pine nuts that might turn
to glass.  How might the sound curve
back to vowel, shore up and blow apart

into a beautifully curved swan, prism-
formed and clear?  An esophagus bent
of red acid eelgrass?  Testicular folds?
Clitoral elongations into light?  A hut

the shape of winged throats swallowing
reptiles whole yet human?  One leg, two legs,
at a syntactic, at a full and gallop like missing
time?  Limbs that might mete out a tail darting sunlit

brand across its back for wheat, right there
in public, in his most partial
poetic yet private?  Hear me heard and heave.
Give me your lulling ectoplasmic.  Give me your tongue

in sacred, dead twitching reptile
nerve.  There was a sense of stop, even before
it a sound he heard the subtle stir begin, an evening
hurt in the backlash urge to make things

whole, more like emptiness, maybe, or a
yogic filling sat in vibrationless sound.  Still
a black wall might darken
to white if that’s all there was

on the saliva tongue.  A healing mouth
might lost it in eat to clarify the butter
over ancient song, chlorinate, that is, the rippling cleanse
center clear through to crisp chameleon vowel,

to tender tiny eggs of vast young vaginal testicles,
all the way up without drop or become or horse
or creamy adult talk or first-throated swans
of something smothered but pure: knuckle brown, hot, deep.

-----------------

George Kalamaras first poetry collection, The Theory and Function of
Mangoes, won the Four Way Books Intro Series Award. He is the recipient
of Creative Writing Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts

and the Indiana Arts Commission.


George Kalamaras’s poems turn the poetic process upside down. The result

is a poetry that hurtles the reader over the edges of perception and
experience. His achievement becomes text as vision, and his visionary
completion arrives through the surprise of a magical
language.               —Ray Gonzalez

This new book by George Kalamaras is a fit successor to his
prize-winning debut collection, The Theory and Function of Mangoes.
Here, in the new book, the sheer abundance and quality of language, the
inventiveness, are not usually encountered in today's occasions of
poetry. Few collections send us on a journey of such magnitude both
Earthy and as a testament to the enduring constellations of love.
        —Gene Frumkin

The poetic world of George Kalamaras is the trickster world, in which
identity is never fixed, and anything can become anything else at the
drop of an image. It is also the world of the metaphysical visionary and

pilgrim. In these brilliant and endlessly resourceful poems, the
materiality of language at every moment plays both with and against the
spirit’s drive towards transcendence. “Is there a way out of one’s
soul?” the poet asks. “I might one day arrive on your stoop, clasping a
box of my own thinking dust,” he warns us. And, of course, he does
arrive on our stoops, bringing with him not only his own thinking,
playing, dreaming, and endlessly seeking dust, but also the gift of a
visionary and electrically-charged language. Sometimes unsettling,
sometimes profoundly erotic, sometimes dense with broken parts of
speech, with syntax wrenched from its predictable order, these poems
never do the expected. Their power springs equally from yogic meditation

with its search for a dissolution of the self’s boundaries, surrealism
with its privileging of irrational and playful juxtaposition as a mode
both of discovery and of revolt, and the ancient traditions of riddle
and wordplay. This is a global poetry for the 21st century, at home
equally with the great meditative traditions of Asia, Europe, and the
Americas.
        —Judith Johnson

Mammogram the bildungsroman, induce
dingbat hexameters in the heldentenor’s
yeasty Hornitos.  Queen Ixnay to the E-bay
goes Braxton-Hicks on mother’s bad milk day.
Computer’s at last completely stewy—
picked up a bug at the honor bar.  Citizen Quiggley
from the Gun and Doll Commission seeks flap
with pointillistic gabardine.  Bad weekends for
two straight quarters—look inward and talk
to the polygraph:  Have you grokked
Hampton Hawes today?

Hey, they were fisting my peoples
on the Road to Hematosis.  In what woods were you,
Goody Hooper?  We were mewling lords of power
in the Gallery of World Sculpture,
waving from the piazza
with the rabbi’s seltzer bottle.  Come, Selma
and scotchguard the rainbow
to the john of the Sunset Room.  Give us an ‘E’
for unpleasant Effordent.  To cry ‘uncle’
in a wartime theater, that

Was all our pleasure:  to swap knuckles
with a gorgeous case of tartar.  Yes,
we were all feeling Amish.  Denver, please bring me
my omelet pan and we’ll bang at the congressman’s gams.
I have seen the gated community, and it looks
a lot like us.  Hiss fireworks, steam
the Atlantic—green sleestack, be all that.

In Rouge State, Rodney Koeneke puts the blush back on the demotic. His
idiomatic montage is a careening screed dictated from a state of alert,
all puns intended to turn the hose back on a culture run literally
amuck, and whose marquee reads:  Raw, Red, Rouge, Incarnadine. Welcome
to these states!

 —Michael Gizzi

Mammogram the bildungsroman, induce / dingbat hexameters in the
heldentenor’s / yeasty Hornitos.” It’s about time somebody said it.
Hornitos was never yeastier, hexameters never dingbattier, the
bildungsroman never more mammogrammed than in Rouge State, Rodney
Koeneke’s “extensive cruise / across the bruised Sargasso of white male
sexuality.” Cannily an(a)esthet(ic)izing the misogynist and orientalist
phantasms that are projected on the digital plateaux of its own prosodic
bravado, this is how Naked Lunch might have turned out if it had been
written by Robert Browning having a sex-change operation. There can be
but one sordid bordello of this magnitude, and Koeneke has erected it
squarely at the fissure where the simulacral Middle America of Pop
Warner and bubble top vans collides with a paracolonial hallucination of
Eastern inscrutability inhabited by five-dollar houris and hack oud
players. These elegant verses have teeth, and be warned: behind each
incisor lurks a Dunciad.

—K. Silem Mohammad


Rodney Koeneke was born in Omaha in 1968 and grew up in Tucson and Los
Angeles.  He’s lived in or about San Francisco since 1986.  He has
published a book of history, Empires of the Mind:  I.A. Richards and
Basic English in China, 1929-1979 (Stanford UP, 2003) and keeps two
beautiful goldfish in high style with his tall wife, Lesley Poirier.
Rouge State is his first full-length poetry collection.

that's k(no caps)ari as in capillary, veering if you prefer, with the
idea of nA(replaced with U) meIng . . . I never, I never, on a couple
occasions that I can remember and on those occasions it was someone
else or along that long line... and would lasso  mention personal
nAmes..(replaced by a U) and besides it was neither nor 'p.' whatever
or both to blame 4 this one... no, my good other than to my left or ,
is was a mirror sale, a double what was that coming in as a partial
mistake or costt cutters benefits... so, lets declare the whoops who

Confusion


It can be shown by straightforward substitution that the curves of parent
and daughter activity cross at the exact time that the daughter activity
is a maximum. [...] Parent Activity A1. Daughter Activity, A2.

I. Fast Daughter, L2 = 10L1, T2 = T1/10
II. Slow Daughter, L2 = .5L1, T2 = 2T1

The first daughter, Th, will grow into secular equilibrium with the U
within a matter of days. This is illustrated by the "fast-daughter" (type
I) curve of problem 9. After a few days we may consider the Th activity
equal to the U activity, and go on to consider how the Pa grows in.

murder -- at her Oakland beauty salon. But the self-published book with
the
crudely drawn cover was so popular that Bowens could never get her hands
on it, so
she went out, bought her own copies of Jackson's four novels and read
them all
-- several times each. Now she recommends the book to everyone she
knows.

Such devotion -- especially among African American readers -- has made
Jackson an underground phenomenon in and around Oakland, the city he
writes about
with an insider's eye for the mean and mystical streets. A custodian at
the
Oakland Police Department by day, Jackson said he has sold about 35,000
copies of
his $13 books, largely at independent bookstores like A World of Books
in San
Leandro, where Jackson is far and away the best-selling author.

So far, the corporate book chains have turned up their noses. But that
may be
about to change.

"Hip-hop lit," "urban lit," "street lit," "ghetto lit" -- all terms for
this
new literary genre -- has exploded in cities across the country, and the
publishing industry is taking notice. The genre, which got a big boost
from the
1999 publication of Sister Souljah's violent coming-of-age novel, "The
Coldest
Winter Ever," now accounts for more than 30 percent of the sales at the
Black
Library Booksellers, which sells African American literature online and
at
kiosks in Boston.

Hip-hop lit runs the gamut from better known books such as Vickie
Stringer's
"Let That Be the Reason," Shannon Holmes' "B-More Careful," and Teri
Woods'
"True to the Game" to newcomers with titles that offer a good hint about
what's
inside the cover: "Thugs and the Women Who Love Them," "One Crazy- Ass
Night:
A Hardcore Novel," "Revenge: When Nothing Else Works" and "Threesome."

"People are stepping out to the forefront, saying, 'This is the music we
like, the clothes we like to wear and the books we like to read,' " said
Stringer,
who co-founded Triple Crown Publications with Holmes after their
street-wise
manuscripts were rejected from countless publishing houses. Recently,
Simon &
Schuster signed Stringer and Holmes to six-figure deals, following the
runaway
success of their first books. Both authors started writing while serving
prison sentences.

"I was happy to add them to my list for two reasons. They sell. Shannon
sold
over 150,000 of his first book. Vickie has followed suit with her
first," said
Malaika Adero, an editor at Atria Books, a division of Simon & Schuster.
"And
I like the work in the sense that they're good storytellers. And they
are
writing in the same sensibility as hip-hop recording artists are in that
they're
writing to this generation. They know what this generation appreciates,

what their values are, what the realities of their lives are."

As the books gain wider distribution, it's inevitable that they'll reach
beyond their core black audience, Adero said -- just as hip-hop music
did. "These
books, if they haven't crossed over yet, I don't see why they wouldn't,
" she
said, adding, "Surely there will be an Eminem coming around any day."

The so-called hip-hop books can be easily identified: They are page-
turners
rife with violence, sex and crime; they're often populated by African
American
characters; they're especially popular among reluctant readers, notably
including young, black men; and the language, cadences, subject matter
and
aesthetic evoke comparisons to hip-hop music. The books also tend to
have a following
in jail -- authors and merchants say they frequently ship the books to
prison
addresses and some accept payments in stamps, one of the few currencies
prisoners can accrue.
Jackson, 44, a relentless salesman, fast talker, former rapper, and a
single
father to three daughters and a niece, is a prototypical street lit
author: He
has an irrepressible entrepreneurial spirit, a following in prison, and
a
need for a good copy editor. He also has a big issue with Barnes & Noble
and
Walden Books in Oakland, which have refused to carry his series. And, of
course,
he has the action and the characters, such as evil Buckey Jones, "a fool
in
every sense of the word . . . not really ugly, you wouldn't want him
going out
with your daughter either."

His bad guys tend to say things like, "dis s -- gone put us on da map,
let
all dem fools know we ain't ta be f -- wit, y'all wit me?" And female
characters
are often described from head to toe, as in, "a large woman, her legs
were as
thick as tree trunks. . . . She had a small waist and large booty which
switched from side to side with each step she took." Readers rarely have
to wait
more than a couple chapters to get to a murder or a racy sex scene.

Jackson became a novelist almost by accident. To help his daughter
understand
descriptive writing for a homework assignment, he composed a paragraph
about
washing a car on a hot summer day. After his daughter took off,
he sat staring at his computer screen for a few minutes. Then, figuring
he
had nothing better to do, he started to type, sending his car-washing
character
to Baskin Robbins, where, lo and behold, he met a "phine" woman.
Every day after work, Jackson said, he raced home to write more of his
story.
"By the time I got to chapter four," he said, "I was sitting there
thinking:
'I could write a book.' "

"I knew I could do this, but not many people believed me," he said. "I
didn't
know anyone personally who had written a book, especially a fictional
novel.
If you don't know anyone who's done it, then you don't think you can.
You
can't picture it."

But he purged his life of naysayers -- including a girlfriend who didn't
like
the idea of investing money to self-publish -- and released "Oaktown
Devil"
in 1999. The book begins with the very paragraph Jackson had used as an
example: "It was a very hot summer day, at least 95 degrees. So hot you
could see
waves in front of your eyes. After procrastinating all morning I finally
washed
the car."

Jackson said that it wasn't until someone purchased a book and asked him
to
sign it that he thought, "I guess I'm an author." His first reading was
held at
the West Oakland branch of the public library, by coincidence, also the
first
building he had cleaned for the city of Oakland 20 years earlier.

Since those early heady days, Jackson has continued to write on a
rigorous
schedule -- he tries to produce a page a day and has pumped out a book
almost
every year. "Oaktown Devil" was followed by "Shakey's Loose," "Turf War"
and
"Peanut's Revenge." "Crackhead," his fifth novel, is complete but not
out yet,
and he's working on No. 6, "Sweet Pea's Secret." Last year, he won the
Chester
Himes Award, the top prize at the annual Chester Himes Black Mystery
Writers
Conference.

Jackson, who grew up with eight siblings and a single mom in North
Richmond,
East and West Oakland, says he mines people, places and events of his
occasionally rowdy past for inspiration.

"These eyes have seen a lot," said Jackson, who briefly ran with a "hood
rat"
crowd in Richmond before voluntarily straightening out in high school.
"Of
course, I make it up. But I know it could be real, because it happens
every day.
. . . It's my version of what happens in the ghetto. Unlike most people,
I'm
not outside looking in."

Though hip-hop lit in general might seem overly simplified or terribly
exaggerated, it's this keeping-it-real quality that fans most frequently
say they
respond to.

"I could relate to it because it's like the stuff going on in Oakland .
. .
killing for no reason, drugs and turf wars. He understands what Oakland
has to
go through," Michelle Hang, a ninth grader at Oakland Technical High
School,
said of "Oaktown Devil."

"It's just like picking up the newspaper and finding out what's
happening to
other people in the community," said Bowens, 47, who now owns a complete
autographed set and a reading set of the series. "If you've lived,
you've
experienced some of the stuff in (Jackson's) books, especially if you're
in the black
community. It could be someone in your family or someone you know. . . .
It's
real."

Booksellers and librarians have been marveling at the popularity of the
books
among young, black men -- a demographic group that tends to veer away
from
novels. "If you read the surveys," said Lloyd Hart Jr., the co-owner of
the
Black Library Booksellers, "most black males do not read a lot of
fiction. "

At Oakland High School, librarian Iantha Cooper shrugs it off when
Jackson's
books disappear and buys more -- occasionally with her own money - -
because
she's happy to see teenagers so enthused about fiction.

"If a boy wants to have the book, let him have it," she said. "Let him
have
it."

"If nothing else," said Clara Anthony, who owns a black bookstore in
Baltimore, "it's caused a whole generation to read."

Not everyone is enthusiastically welcoming these new literary arrivals,
however.

"I'm not happy about it because I like good literature. If you don't
hone
your craft, if don't put effort and energy into honing your craft, it's
an insult
to writers that do," said Blanche Richardson, the manager of the
Afrocentric
Marcus Bookstores in Oakland and San Francisco. "I don't mean to be
snooty
about it, but some of this stuff, you couldn't possibly read. There's a
book in
here called 'Booty Call.' I keep turning it sideways because I don't
want to
look at it." Some of the books are so hastily thrown together, she said,
that
sentences are missing verbs, or the words "their" and "there" are
confused
throughout, or the errors are so abundant it would be a compliment to
call them
typos, because "that assumes they know how to spell."

Some also object to what they see as the books' uncritical relationship
to
crime and violence.

"The glorification of pimps and ho's -- that bothers me a lot,"
Richardson
said. "That codification of culture which I find demeaning. They truly
do
glorify street life." Some employees at Alameda County's Juvenile Hall
don't like
street lit to circulate because they think the books promote criminal
behavior,
said Jackson, who's been invited to talk to youth there on several
occasions.

But even Richardson said some hip-hop lit -- and she includes Jackson's
books
here, though she hasn't read them -- are more sophisticated or more
cautionary than others.

"Our books are true to hip-hop, but our books have consequences," said
Stringer of Triple Crown Publications. "We take them on that ride, but
at the end of
that ride they crash into a wall. We encourage them not to live like
that."

The bad guys in Jackson's series also always go down in the end, which
some
fans say makes the books morality tales, after a fashion. But Jackson
doesn't
concern himself with those kinds of questions.

"I don't try to write for nobody's social conscience or nothin'," he
said.

"I don't worry about nothin' when I write, I just write. . . . It's,
like,
fiction. I can say what I want to."

It occurred to me to bring up the problem of the situationists again, as well as
the surrealists, possibly the whole idea of the cenacle posed in Balzac's novels.
Which links to the idea of branding, and to the Godfather, and to um, Guy Debord's
last book on the mafia, and Mario Puzo's last book on the Borges clan.

Is it possible to have a literary group without it turning into a de facto mafia?

Or do we simply accept that the mafia is the truest essence of corporate political
life, the distilled structure -- and that all of our laughable attempts at fairness
are denied by something deep within human nature?

I have decided to teach Mario Puzo's novels for the Great Writer class in Spring.
I've been haunted by the Godfather films -- even Derrida said in an interview that
it's the only film he will watch ovr and over, and when it's on he can't stop
watching it.

Most of the people who will take my course are hotel management majors, so they may
at least stay awake.  The first two novels by Puzo were critical successes about
Italian immigrants -- nobody much read them.  Has anybody on the list read these?
The only book I've read was called the Last Don -- very simple sentences, and lousy
style, but somehow riveting.  I imagine I can stomach reading the rest of it.

Guy Debord, the leader of the situationists, the capo, if you will, says in his
last book before he was apparently shot in the head by a Mafia set-up, that the
mafia is the basic structure of capital. Nobody knows if his death was a suicide,
but there was no note, and he was apparently doing research on the mob.

And Puzo says that the Catholic church with its popes and armies was the basic
structure of the Mafia.

Is it also the basic structure of literary life in America?  How far have we
evolved past baboons?  Is the gang still the basic unit?

That's quite interesting, Kirby. Yes, it seems like literary groups or
'schools' are strongly operative, doesn't it. Yet there are figures like
Apollinaire who kept an eye on the work coming from various groups but was
not of any of them. There's quite a bit of talk about how there are no
'individual geniuses' these days. Usually from the groups? Whether there are
'individual geniuses' or not, there is such a thing as an independent
intellectual, isn't there.

Yes, but I am not so sure we need more. Documents already exist. Both
national law, for instance the US Copyright law that Paula quoted,
and international agreements such as the Berne convention have the
exception in authors' monopoly called fair use or fair dealing, which
includes correctly attributed quotations of published works.

I think the rest is just people trying to pull a scam and thus
actually trying to violate the copyright legislation. So, still, if
we could come up with an actual case where the plaintiff has won,
this would be truly remarkable. The burden of proof is on their part
- not on our part, who are using quotation for critical purposes.

Would you all be so kind as to send some other recommendations?

You could send him to the archives of nettime - the Unstable Digest, which
is edited by Florian Cramer, Beatrice Beaubien, and myself; there's also
the work of mez online. Solipsis and many others are on the wryting email
list; if he wants to sub, send me his email address. There is also a lot
of work on the arc_hive and syndicate email lists; on the latter, the work
of nn is often to be found.

Solipsis (Lanny Quarles) has a website as well. The best thing to do re:
the above, is to use google; a _lot_ will show up. You might also look at
the old ascii art newsgroups, also available through google.

Kent sent me a reply to my recent post. I'm pasting his response at the
bottom of the message.

Kent--Thanks for the interesting clarification.  The first couple of
sentences seemed like something I might be able to agree with, but you
lost me again with the "scary haunted house" metaphor.  I was reminded of
Duncan's opinion of the comparison of poetry to a game of tennis (Frost):

"Frost is right in his sense that the meters and rimes of regulation verse
have a counterpart in the rules, marked areas of the court, and net of the
tennis game...But, for those who see life as something other than a tennis
game, without bounds, and who seek in their sciences and arts to come into
that life, into an imagination of that life, the thought comes that the
counterpart of free verse may be free thought and free movement.  The
explorer displays the meaning of physical excellence in a way different
from that displayed by the tennis player."

Agreeing with Duncan, I don't really think poetry should be a game like
tennis
(though I like tennis quite a lot) & I don't think it should be a scary
thrill ride either.  "The horror" is not a game.

Steve,

I saw your comment at Poetics. Nice to have your response.

I guess I'd put my point differently there now if I could, but I didn't at
all intend to imply that
we should allow ourselves to become glibly enthused by the horror and
write silly, incoherent
things, or something. Rather, that poetry also might have the function of
showing the horror and
insanity of the moment without refracting it in well-rehearsed ways
through prior ideological
screens (and not that such refracting isn't absolutely apropos and
necessary). To make the poem a
scary haunted house ride, all ideologies admitted, so to say, rather than
hold the poem to a
"position," whether the position be traditionally or experimentally
proffered. (though, again,
these approaches have their key roles, too.)

A big topic, of course, and in the case of that section my comments are
impressionistic, to say the
least, so your take is somewhat understandable. But just wanted to send
you this little
"clarification" for what it may be worth.

Feel free to share this with the list, if you think it would be
appropriate.

Subject: <nettime> Artistic autonomy and the communication society


Following is the text I read in one of those rather disagreeable
places to which art circles sometimes lead you. This time, the Tate
Modern.

The conference, held this Saturday October 25, was called Diffusion:
Collaborative Practice in Contemporary Art. Also present were Bureau
d'Etudes, Francois Deck, Eve Chiapello, Jochen Gerz, Stephen Wright,
John Roberts, Charles Green, and others.

Important to the understanding of the gesture involved in reading
such a text in a place like Tate Modern is the visual material,
beginning with the photo of Jack Lang and Fidel, moving through the
screen captures on the Tate's corporate patronage, with the British
Petroleum adverts and so forth, and leading to the press clippings of
the mounting British troop committments in Irak, and the photos of
"the society of leaders": Blush and Blair, Bush and Chirac, Bush and
Schroeder, Bush and Berslusconi, Bush and Aznar, Bush and Bush...
Then you would have further material on the marginal realms of
protest and "exit," and finally, on the NSK project discussed in
conclusion.

The aim of these kinds of interventions is to break the
long-discredited, but still practically imposed taboo on publicly
discussion of the social relations that lie behind "our" cultural
institutions, which, in the case of museums like the Tate Modern,
have clearly almost nothing to do with former conceptions of the
public sphere, and in no way support "free cooperation." To the
extent that these institutions ultimately depend on a far wider
circle of participants than the ones they objectively serve, maybe
there's still some interest in this kind of straight talking. And
beyond the aspect of denunciation, there is the question: in addition
to the diffuse crativity of protest, what is a strong ambition for
concentrated art today?

best, Brian

***

Artistic Autonomy
and the communication society


Among my various collaborations with Bureau d'Etudes there is this
one-off journal or fanzine called "Artistic Autonomy - and the
communication society". This project was born out of the desire to
create what seems almost non-existent in the French language: a
debate about the means, results and ends of artistic practice,
independent from the categories established by the state and the
market.

Why talk about autonomy when the major thrust of experimental art in
the sixties and seventies was to undermine the autonomous work? This
is the question that always arises when you speak with those for whom
the institutional discourses still seem to matter. Indeed, the
university careers that have been made by refuting Greenburg, by
deconstructing the totality of the white male Kantian subject, and by
critiquing the closure of the artistic frame are seemingly infinite.
And the same  holds for the paradoxes that invariably arise when
mechanically reproduced works or slices of everyday life are
presented in the singularizing spaces of the museum. Sometimes you
wonder if the members of the art establishment are not afraid to draw
the conclusions of their own ideas. Yet if one truly abandons the
notion that an object, by its distinction from all others, can serve
as a mirror for an equally singular and independent subject, then the
issue of autonomy becomes a deep existential problem, just as it was
in the 1910s, 20s and 30s, when the whole debate arose. Because for
those without a substitute identity - for those without a passionate
belief in their blackness, their whiteness, their Jewishness, their
Muslimness, their Communistness, their Britishness or  whatever - the
condition of existence in the communication society, that is, the
awareness that one's own mental processes are intimately traversed or
even determined by a flood of mediated images and signs, is at first
deeply anguishing, then ultimately anesthetizing, as the postmodern
"waning of the affect" sets in. We work always under the pall of this
postmodern anesthetic.

No doubt there are thousands of exciting ways to make artworks where
the question of autonomy is not at issue. But there is some doubt as
to whether any of these ways of art-making can be called political.
Does politics, in the democratic sense at least, not presuppose that
one is somehow able to make a free decision? That one is not blindly
driven by a determining, heteronomous force, whether of pain or
pleasure? What does it mean to make an artistic decision? And what
happens when that decision is collective? How can the sensible world
- that is, the world composed by the senses, the intellect and the
imagination - be reshaped according to what Fran=E7ois Deck would call
a "strategy of freedom"?

The stakes of autonomy are revealed by the etymology of the word, as
has been pointed out by the political philosopher and psycho-analyst
Cornelius Castoriadis. "Autos" means self and "nomos" means law.
Autonomy means giving yourself your own law. But men and women are
social beings; we only exist as "ourselves" through the language of
the other, through the sensations of the other; and what is more,
this shared language, these transiting sensations, are bound up in
the uncertainty of memory and forgetting, the incompleteness of
perception, the willfulness of imagination. Thus the attempt to give
oneself one's own law becomes a collective adventure, as well as a
cultural and artistic one. For it is the very essence of clear
consciousness to recognize that we human beings are full of
obscurity, of unresolved personal and even historical passions, of
half-understood images and enticing forms that we constantly exchange
with one another, so that the process of giving ourselves our own
laws becomes something quite complex, something experimental and
experiential, which can never be resolved once and for all, but only
cared for and ushered along in manifold ways, among which we find the
arts - those supreme combinations of sensation, intellect and
productive imagination. In fact it is exactly at this point that
freedom appears as an uncertain strategy among the multitude, because
it cannot be reduced to a univocal decision by the one. And in this
way, collective autonomy  becomes a question both of individual or
small-group artistic production, and of large-scale cultural policy.

My belief is that you can only have a real democracy when a societal
concern with the production of the sensible is maintained at the
level of a forever unresolved but constantly and intensely debated
question. This is why I like to work with Fran=E7ois Deck - because he
has developed a method, a kind of artistic trick, that allows him to
explicitly bring the sensible world into collective questioning. What
we really need to do is to spend a lot more time asking each other
whether our cultural fictions - our architecture and our ideas, our
hierarchies and ambitions and loves - are really any good for us. And
to do that, we need to propose new fictions, to shake up the
instituted imaginary with what Castoriadis calls the "instituting
imaginary." We need to engage in desymbolization and resymbolization,
in what Bureau d'Etudes calls "the deconstruction and reconstruction
of complex machines." This is the way that artistic practices can
affect reality.

So I'm saying that art can be a chance for society to collectively
reflect on the imaginary figures which it depends upon for its very
consistency. But this is exactly where our societies are failing. I
think we're looking at a disaster. To show you the extent of it, and
the degree to which it calls for a reinvention of artistic autonomy,
I want to use two examples. One is a programmatic sentence from the
former French culture minister, Jack Lang. And the other is the
concrete reality of a major British museum. These two examples will
give you, I hope, a fairly precise idea of what I mean by the
communication society, and of why it is necessary to conceive
artistic autonomy against the background of the really existing
institutions of communication.

Jack Lang is one of the great socialist managers of people's minds,
one the architects of artistic, the people who channel it and control
it over time. I can't imagine a better photograph of him than this
one, standing with Fidel Castro in front of the Mona Lisa. In 1983,
the year that French socialism abandoned its collectivist utopia and
the long economic crisis began, Lang came out with this slogan: La
culture, c'est les po=E8tes, plus l'=E9lectricit=E9. "Culture is the poets,
plus electricity."

"This kind of mesmerism is a constant in his conception of art,"
writes a French critic (Philippe Urfalino). For Lang, "Culture is an
economic weapon because it can change mentalities, and because the
crisis is not just economic, but also a crisis of the mind. The power
of creativity is to elicit agitation, movement, to transform energy
into labor." A lot of very interesting ideas have been developed
about the liberating potential of creative work, what is called
immaterial labor. But Jack Lang, like Chris Smith in Britain, is the
state's great visionary of immaterial labor. And this means that he
wants to functionalize it, to manage it, to give it a productive
discipline. The idea for Smith is literally to map out our sensations
from above, to establish a "Creative Mapping Document" that will
productively channel our aspirations into a thousand variations on
the advertising industry. And the irony is that this central planning
of the spirit reaches back to another would-be architect of humanity:
Lenin, at the Congress of Soviets in 1920, who said: "Communism is
Soviet power, plus the electrification of the entire country." So
which will prove stronger: poetry or electricity? Which proved
stronger in the past: the radical democracy of the workers' councils,
or the industrial discipline of electrification?

The Tate Modern is the living allegory of these histories. It's a
former electric power plant, a pure product of the meeting between
the bureaucratic state and capitalist industry. This was a place for
discipline, for the total control of a workforce. It's a mausoleum, a
tomb, which the party cadres of New Labour have turned into a tourist
attraction, a kind of crystal palace of globalization. It can be
illuminated, electrified in its turn: so the tomb of the working
class is made into a glittering artwork. Poetry meets electricity.
And the Tate Modern also has a constructivist, Tatlinesque bridge
that connects it directly to the heart of the City, as a public
service for the financial district. It's important to admit what this
kind of neoliberal institution is built on. Its corporate sponsors
are the heart, not just of British but of Imperial capitalism:
Barclay's plc, Europe's largest institutional investor; Lloyds, the
world's largest insurance company; British Telecom, one of the
backbones of the communication society, a top advertiser and now the
great British art patron; and finally British Petroleum, I mean
"Beyond Petroleum," planting the sunflower seeds of the future in
your head. For corporations like these, creating belief, manipulating
desire, and maintaining the anesthesia of the public is the most
important production. And these companies now actively use the world
of art, they make museums into private universities, like Bloomberg's
holding seminars for its executives on Level 7, as a way to stimulate
their energy, their experimental faculties, their virtuosity in the
manipulation of abstract figures. Yes, in this sense, and far more
than in the days of the situationists, art is the ultimate commodity,
it's the one that sells all the rest. Because it mobilizes you, it
plugs you into a communications loop, it gets you to adhere, to
commit, to do your part, to play your role, to burn the midnight oil,
it makes you part of a dynamic society. It makes you part of a
society of leaders.

What kind of attitude to take, when you know how tightly an
institution like the Tate is integrated to what Bureau d'=E9tudes has
identified as the financial core of transnational state capitalism?
One thing is sure: the old strategy of forming a collective as a way
to get into the museum becomes absurd. That much has been proved by
the submissive posturing of a group like etoy, which endlessly
reiterates the forms of corporate organization, from head-hunting
rituals all the way down to the display of self-infantilization. The
collaborative art of etoy only restates the painfully obvious: that
the values of transnational state capitalism have permeated the art
world, not only through the commodity form, but also and even
primarily, through the artists' adoption of management techniques and
branded subjectivities. It is in this sense that contemporary
capitalism has absorbed the artistic critique of the 1960s,
transforming it into the networked discipline of "neomanagement," as
Eve Chiapello says in her work, or into the opportunism of what I
call "the flexible personality."

One response to all of this is - exit. It has been possible to shift
the work away from objects, and outside of the immediately normative
network, into marginal realms of protest and opposition whose
consistency and sustainability over time becomes the key issue. Yet
in my opinion, this exit into the margins is still intimately and
paradoxically intertwined with the communication society. We all know
very well that the Internet, whose hardware has been built by
industrial corporations close to the financial core, is currently the
single most integrative system there is. It is what I call an
Imperial infrastructure. And it acts as an ideological state
apparatus, in the Althusserian sense, but on the scale of
transnational capitalism: it hails you, it connects to you and gives
you an IP number; it interpellates you into Imperial ideology. In
this way it exterts its deterritorializing effect, it transforms
populations according to the requirements of capital, configuring the
global division of labor. But at the same time, by simultaneously
increasing the levels of both alienation and communicational agency,
it has made possible new territorializations, new social and
political formations, which reopen the questions of class composition
- and therefore, the possibilities of a new kind of class antagonism,
outside the communist and workerist frameworks that date back before
the time of Lenin. The last few years have offered a multitude of
opportunities for artists to work outside the established
institutions, and off the traditional mental maps, in order to
experiment, to create and distribute farflung new imaginaries. We
have seen many new inventions. And it has also been possible, with
difficulty of course, to raise the level of threat, and to help
provoke a crisis of legitimacy, through the complex practice of a
self-dissolving, carnavalesque violence which has been both useful
and necessary. These practices, as insufficient and rapidly outdated
as they may be, have had the enormous advantage, for people involved
in art and activism, of constituting positions from which to speak,
positions at once distinct from and connected to the larger social
landscape. They have given real meaning to another one of the
collaboration projects I'm involved in, which is the attempt to
define the communicative, collective, reciprocal and mutually
sustaining individuation of the Multitudes.

The proof of all this can be found in France today. Why have the
themes we developed in our little fanzine, Artistic Autonomy and the
communication society, become real issues in France? Not because
people read our texts! Rather because the owning class, the bosses'
union, has directly attacked part-time theater and cinema workers,
restricting their welfare benefits in a bid to discipline and
functionalize their production. And a wide range of people have begun
responding collaboratively, by targeting specific functions of the
communication society, which are suddenly made to appear as
illegitimate, and which are even branded with their illegitimacy. On
Saturday, October 18, group of these part-time performers broke into
the major machinery for the production of the collective imaginary,
interrupting a prime-time broadcast called "Star Academy" and
unfurling a banner that read: "Shut off your TVs." Throughout the
week before that, a networked movement had arisen to deface the
advertisements that pollute the public space of the metro. These
actions constitute a live reflection on our collective fictions, on
the instituted imaginary of the current neoliberal system. And this
kind of symbolic violence, practiced collectively in the open air and
raised to a level of engaged reflection on what we want our society
to become, is a far more interesting collaboration than anything I
have yet seen in a museum. Mind you, I don't want to make exaggerated
claims: these actions amount to almost nothing at all, compared to
the problems arising in the world today. But they show an awareness
of key issues in the search for collective autonomy. If we want to
regain any chance to turn collective reflection into positive action,
then we must make the production of the collective imaginary into an
open question again. Only in this way can we stop the pollution of
our minds, by gaining some kind of control over the means of
distribution.

Shall we then just abandon the museums? My position is that they can
be occupied just like any other distribution mechanism within the
communication society - and they should be occupied, in an
uncompromising way, so as to generate not just debate, but conflict
over how they are run and what they stand for. But there's an even
more important question, which is this: Shall we abandon the
historical practice of experimental art, as it emerged from its last
metamorphosis, in the period around 1968? Is this kind of art fatally
involved with neomanagement, or completely permeated by the
opportunism of the flexible personality?

I'd like to close with a reference to a group of artists from another
place and epoch, who were not seeking to exit the museum, nor even
the communication society, but who created a theatrical and
conceptual fiction in a bid to reflexively transform the
authoritarian state - which in their view had appropriated and
distorted the avant-garde artistic tradition. I'm talking about the
Slovene art group NSK, or Neue Slowenische Kunst, and particularly
about their project , "The State in Time."

I will read from their texts:

"In the year 1991 NSK has been re-defined from an Organisation to a
State. A state in time, a state without territory and national
borders, a sort of "spiritual, virtual state". It has issued an
original NSK passport and everybody can become its holder and
therefore a citizen of the NSK State. The Passport can be used
creatively, also as an official travel document, naturally with a
certain hazard to its owner.... The NSK state denies... the
categories of fixed territory, the principle of national borders, and
advocates the law of transnationality. Besides NSK members the
beneficiaries of the right to citizenship are thousands all over the
world, people of different religions, races, nationalities, sexes and
beliefs. The right to citizenship is aquired through ownership of the
passport."

Why did NSK create this strange conceptual machine, a State in Time?
One reason was to assert the subjective consistency and
sustainability of a group of people who effectively choose their own
laws, who shape their own society. This attempt to imagine the forms
of autonomy was decisively important for them, as the old Yugoslav
state collapsed, and a new, but also unsatisfying state was formed.
But there is another level to this reflexive act, to this artistic
transformation of the political imaginary. Because it is not so easy
to create one's own laws. One only does so in the shadow of far
larger organizations, which can alienate one's ideas and sensations,
which can prey parasitically upon one's deepest aspirations. And so
the social forms of alienation must be exorcized, made to give back
what they have captured, to release what they have appropriated and
distorted. In the case of NSK, this alienating force was the
national, territorial state, which in Yugoslavia bore the double
heritage of Nazism and Stalinism. As they write:

"Modern art has not yet overcome the conflict brought about by the
rapid and efficient assimilation of historical avant-garde movements
in the systems of totalitarian states.... Neue Slowenische Kunst...
revives the trauma of avant-garde movements by identifying with
it.... The most important and at the same time traumatic dimension of
avant-garde movements is that they operate and create within a
collective.... The question of collectivism, i.e. the question of how
to organize communication and enable the coexistence of various
autonomous individuals in a community, can be solved in two different
ways. Modern states continue to be preoccupied with the question of
how to collectivize and socialize the individual, whereas avant-garde
movements tried to solve the question of how to individualize the
collective. Avant-garde movements tried to develop autonomous social
organisms in which the characteristics, needs and values of
individualism, which cannot be comprised in the systems of a formal
state, could be freely developed and defined. The collectivism of
avant-garde movements had an experimental value. With the collapse of
the avant-garde movements, social constructive views in art fell into
disgrace, which caused the social escapism of orthodox modernism and
consequently led to a crisis in basic values in the period of
postmodernism."
  (Eda Kufer + Irwin, Ljubljana, 1992, http://www.ljudmila.org/embassy)

NSK defines experimental, vanguard art as attempt to individualize
the collective, to develop the characteristics, needs and values of
individuals within the framework of autonomous social organizations -
what they call constructive organizations, or what I might call the
society of the multitudes. From the viewpoint of exploding Yugoslavia
in 1991, at a time when it was politically necessary to reflect on
the form that such an autonomous social organization could take, NSK
attempted to exorcize the totalitarian state, and to replay the
traumatic history of vanguards, so as to recover their experimental
potential.

At the present time, and from the viewpoint of the advanced
capitalist countries, I believe that an ambition for sophisticated
and concentrated art would be to exorcize the institutional forms of
transnational state capitalism, which has appropriated and distorted
the experimental art of the period around 1968. The only viable
reason that I can see to come into a museum like this, is to use it
as one of many possible stages on which to dramatize the difference
between the networked discipline of neoliberalism, and the
experimentalism of an evolving artistic practice that makes autonomy
into a theme of constructive reflection between freely developing
individuals.

Regarding the recent discussion of the Kent Johnson letter, the call for a "unified front" and the call for "openness to all ideological positions" often strike me as mirror opposites, two extremes that never actually happen; we're never on the clear edge of one or the other but always somewhere in the murkier middle.

Even among those people who would say that the war in Iraq requires poets to make a definite call to resistance, means and reasons for doing such things vary--and that's a good thing too, even there, since the right to variability is essential to the openness that poetry can suggest. There may be crucial agreements, but there are no blanket similarities. A "unified front" can be a powerful idea, but it strikes me as a good thing that it's unlikely to be an actuality.

Similarly, the idea that we can open our poetry (and our lives?) to hearing all ideological positions suggests not only that an individual can recognize all the ideological positions that are out there (can you recognize them? I can't) but that we can to a certain degree present all those positions without our own ideological biases stepping in. Some of us can do this better than others, perhaps, but ultimately such an idea suggests that we can remove ourselves from the situation and view it from a clear distance. That's certainly been one of the most common fantasies of liberal discourse; that from the position of our own openness we can bring everything to the table and allow it just to be what it is inside our magnanimous or objectively critical (take your pick) vision. Everything can coexist at our table!

For me, it depends on the time and place whether I am more influenced by the desire for ideological unity or the desire for greater openness--I suppose I'd generally come down on the side of greater openness, if I come down generally anywhere, except for my tendency to get really pissed off when I think somebody has done or said something outrageously stupid and damaging. I can be so much more limited than I'd like to be, but on the other hand, hey, I don't want to help it that there are some borders I just don't feel like crossing.

Here's another round from me and Kent (his message below mine):

Kent--Well, I don't want to start flogging a dead horse in the middle of our
tennis court, but I did look, and it wasn't clear, at least to me.  You
said "to make the poem a scary, haunted house ride, all ideologies admitted,"
so that sure sounds like poem-as-thrill-ride to me. But as you elaborate the
analogy now I guess we're all on the ride and there's now way off.  But does
this let the stage-managers and string-pullers have the final say about what
the world is?  I'm sure that's not what you had in mind, but I still don't seem
to want to live in that analogy.  But perhaps this is a case of analogical
slipperiness, such that we're really talking at cross-purposes.

At any rate, I'd probably also agree with Mark W. that's difficult to actually
hold to an "all ideologies admitted" principle.  At some point, I'm probably
gonna take some kind of stand, however tenuous.  But I also like what Mike
Heller says in the new Rain Taxi, when he is asked about "value systems" in
poetry: "poetry itself can proceed from the conceptual or a priori next of
values toward an opening.  In which case, it might also be in the service of
founding new value."

Jim Andrews,

This post -- especially the part about NSK -- was exhilarating to read.  When I
lived in Seattle NSK came several times to work with a museum there due to their
relationship with Charles Krafft and Larry Reid -- long-time marginal
artist-entrepreneurs.  They brought the band, too.  Lubeck (?) was the name of
the band.  Lubeck was the German name for Ljubliana during the Occupation in
WWII.  I was thrilled.  They dressed up in Nazi uniforms and the lead singer
sang as if he was Dracula.  After, at the party, I asked a blond blue-eyed band
member (he was the drummer) if he was a Nazi.

"I'm a Jew," he said.

Miran Mohar, who is one of the five painters in Irwin, spent a couple hours
talking to us.  He is Islamic in origin -- originally from Bosnia as I seem to
recall -- but lives iwth the NSK commune in Ljubliana.  I asked him if he was a
communist, an anarchist, a liberal, or what, and to my great relief he said that
he was like a stock market with all kinds of ups and downs -- fascism up five
points, liberalism down three, anarchism holding steady.  But that he was
volatile!  and every five minutes he wa s adifferent person.  He was not a
full-blooded lunatic.  He held his wine glass steady and he had a good calm
temperament.

I was so relieved in this era of identity politics where people are actually
supposed to BE something (as if this is possible to remain a static identity to
oneself) that here was a guy who was willing to admit with offhand humor that
his stock market MOVED.  What a wonderful way out of this horrific branding in
which race, gender and class is supposed to determined what a human being is
supposed to be, and is also supposed to limit and identify what they are.  A
more repulsive notion could not be created if I worked at it until the sun
burned out.

The painting show by Irwin was probably not memorable but the theoretical
statements that went with it -- that Irwin would attempt to relive the fascist
horror of the early avant-gardes by deliberately invoking fascism, and thus
using a kind of reverse psychology on it, so as to invoke freedom through the
other side of the mirror -- this was the only interesting art show that I saw in
fifteen years of living in Seattle.

That is to say, mentally interesting, conceptually interesting.

This is not to say that there weren't good colorists living on every corner, and
artists who had a feeling for the canvas (ha ha) but in terms of conceptual
bouleversements -- I was bowled over repeatedly only by NSK.

In the same way, I think that Slavoj Zizek is probably the only interesting
theorist still working under the name of postmodernism.  He's turning everything
upside down and inside out.  Although I almost never agree with him, this is
like doing the Charleston with a poltergeist -- reading Zizek's recent books
such as On Belief -- or Why The Christian Legacy is Worth Fighting For -- is
riotous.  He argues that yes, just as Abraham set out to kill his son, so should
the left kill the liberals.  Just as Abraham, ordained by God to do so, set out
to slaughter his boy, so did the Leninists slaughter the Mensheviks.

It's so nuts!  First, Abraham didn't kill his son.  Second, the Bolsheviks had
NO LOVE for the Mensheviks so that IT WASN'T a sacrifice, thirdly, Marxists have
always loved killing liberals so as to have all the power -- it's happened in
every Marxist takeover -- but the blowback is that Zizek taunts you with these
statements -- forcing you to see what's wrong with his statements.  My worry is
that too many literal-minded Americans will take him at his word and reach for
their Winchester.

This is a guy who sees the big concepts, and is playing with them.  If there is
to be a future for any kind of avant-garde, this group is a lonely outpost of
conceptual novelty.

Somehow their biggest innovation is using reverse psychology.  While the
ordinary Marxists keep just trying to tell us what to think, NSK tells us we
ought to think exactly what they are most afraid we will and do think.  It is as
if an American poet today wrote an epic poem in praise of slavery -- bringing
back all its erotics, its lust- and power-filled lunacy NOT as a satire, but as
a deep prayer for its return, with a full and vital reliving of the trauma.
That's what their dressing as Nazis meant.

Instead of pretending to be freedom-loving poets -- writing of our love for the
jeweled explosions of war-time Television, the momentary fulfillment of seeing
small children with arms blown off wailing in the howling dust of an eviscerated
building, the beauty of decapitated buildings and leaping stockbrokers, the lust
of going face to face with the other in dreams of gutting terrorists, and so
on.  there is a voluptuous thrill in all this, or else it wouldn't allow Court
TV to make a living out of atrocity exhibitions such as the snuff documentaries
they show, or the whole genre of "real crime" that gets the hormones pumping and
sends millions of dollars through the publishing industry.

It's no doubt a dangerous project.  But all other projects are completely over
with in my view, and don't open out on to anything with explosive potential and
don't get into the lethal guts of humanity who have been up to these tricks
since recorded history began.  Can it be stopped with a wagging of a Puritanical
finger?  More likely it will only be accelerated.

Perhaps if all art groups thought of themselves as the futurists, and as Mafia
clans, and organized, and actually wore colors and did drive-bys on other art
groups, we would begin to get somewhere toward Utopia.

If feminists just started to blueprint the concentration camps for men, and how
they'd reeducate us with shock treatments, and needles, and whips, and got down
deep into the erotics of it; and militants of all colors just wrote of their
erotic hatred of whitey -- and we all stopped pretending that we can be fair,
then maybe we'd get somewhere.

Apollinaire as I recall did love war.  The explosions in the far-off distance
like naked breasts; the sperm-bullets flying across the trenches into other
men's mouths; the deaths of one's friends huddled at one's feet with the
delighted hordes of flies crawling in what once was their eyes.

It's Halloween 365 days a year in the real minds of men; and the sweet faces
that we wear are the masks.

Intriguing example, but I think "The Waste Land" is ultimately less
interested in exploring political paths than in finding a spiritual exit.

Friendships and Free Publications: a critical exploration of the =
rhizomic nature of, and the gift economy known as, Canadian =
Small/Micropress Publishing

Dear colleagues, friends, writers,

Amidst the collapse of small press distribution, the gradual extinction =
of independent bookstores, a seemingly apathetic public, and really cold =
winters throughout most of the country, it seems somehow important to =
examine the persistent existence of the small/micropress in Canada. Many =
writers find their first publications of a substantial length with small =
or micropresses, which can be an incredible asset along the way to =
theorizing a larger project, or conceptualizing what it could be that =
turns a random sequence of poems into a bound whole. Small and =
micropresses have proven to be an active and enduring location for the =
erasure of the anxieties which can accompany a widely distributed and =
marketed 'book', in this sense it could be considered the non-site of =
Canadian publishing; an extremely active space formerly believed to be =
void, Canada's very own evocative dark matter.

With this issue of 'Open Letter' we invite papers on all aspects of =
small/micropress publishing in Canada with a specific interest in =
contmporary (i.e. post-1980) presses, although we will be flexible on a =
project by project basis. Possible topics include but are by no means =
limited to: the economics of small/micropress publishing vs. larger =
press publishing however that can be figured, interviews pertaining to =
small/micropress publishing in Canada, the politics of small/micropress =
publishing, a critical engagement with a specific press or presses or =
with a specific period of time with a focus on small/micropress =
publishing. We would like to stay away from memoirs, bibliographic =
studies of presses and papers written by affiliates of the presses upon =
which an author is writing.

We ask for papers submitted to be double spaced, 12 pt times new roman =
or equivalent, under 2500 words and saved as one of the following =
filetypes if emailed or mailed on disk: .rtf, .txt, or .doc. Hard copies =
can be mailed to either of the below addresses. The deadline for =
submissions is March 1st, 2004. We eagerly await your submissions.=20

Kent-I confess I haven't read the interview, but only the bit that was
quoted on poetics.  But I have thought a good bit about "The Waste Land,"
and it just seems to me a terrible, repressive model for a "political"
poetry, a true example of the failure of modernism in this regard.  With
that, I have to bow out, a bundle of student essays on my back & a crying
(teething) baby in my arms.  The last word is yours.

This was the case in the late 60's, when New American types of the various denominations readily shared the microphone and publication with representatives of "official verse culture." Poets were united in their opposition to the war, and they set aside their poetic differences for a major goal. And during this time poetry, traditional and experimental together, managed to have a political impact unseen since. A like possibility for alliance existed shortly before the last Iraq war, but it was short-circuited, in significant ways, by sectarian attitudes and pronouncements from particular quarters, which I address in the interview.

Re-Reading Bottom
A Fall 2003 Symposium on Louis Zukofsky's Bottom: on Shakespeare

Louis Zukofsky's Bottom: on Shakespeare was originally published by =
Austin-based Ark Press in 1963 as a two volume work containing =
Zukofsky's text and his wife, Celia's, setting of Shakespeare's Pericles =
to music. The work was republished in 1987 by University of California =
Press and, after a period of being out-of-print, again in 2002 by =
Wesleyan University Press with an introduction by Bob Perelman.=20

"Re-reading Bottom: on Shakespeare A Symposium," scheduled for October =
31st and November 1st of 2003 at the University of Buffalo, will bring =
established and emerging scholars together to make use of the generous =
resources at UB and within the Buffalo Poetry and Arts community. =
Together, we will revisit this groundbreaking, yet highly esoteric text =
in an attempt to examine the way this text has been read in the past, =
and to test one of the most highly regarded, but least understood works =
of the 20th Century.=20
Among other events participants may look forward to at the symposium are =
presentations by Bob Perelman, author of The Trouble with Genius, The =
Marginalization of Poetry, and numerous books of poetry, and Mark =
Scroggins, author of Louis Zukofsky and the Poetry of Knowledge and =
Anarchy, as well as a variety of workshops geared towards discussing =
shorter papers on Bottom by scholars, students and poets. The first of =
these workshops will be co-moderated by Perelman and Scroggins; the =
second by poet-scholars Gregg Biglieri and Louis Cabri. Those =
work-shopping papers include: Antony Adolf, Barbara Cole, Stephen =
Collis, Michael Cross, Kaplan P. Harris, Nick Lawrence, Nick Salvo, =
Trevor Speller, Sasha Steensen, Paul Stephens, and Jeffrey =
Twitchell-Waas.=20

Kirby Olson,

when i read on nettime the essay i reposted here by brian holmes, i too
found it strong and useful, and i thought of you and your similarly
intriguing recent post  "Situationists/Branding/Mafia".

Fascinating, your connection with that piece and NSK. Degrees of freedom?

coincidentally, i lived in Seattle myself. From 1997-2000. Maris Kundzins,
who lives in Seattle, told me of Neoism, in which anyone is free to be Monty
Cantsin (individualizing of the collective). I wonder if Maris, a conceptual
artist, had any relation with NSK (Maris is from Slovenia if I recall
correctly)? Do you know Maris? 'Monty Cantsin' is 'derived' from 'Maris
Kundzins' via David Zack verbal associativity, I understand, from a site on
neoism that published some of Zack's writings about Neoism. coincidentally,
this site was the first net.art project i participated in, in 95 (
http://www.thing.de/projekte/7:9%23/Welcome.html ) -- though i didn't know
anything about neoism at the time.

I don't know whether Apollinaire loved war. He died from wounds sustained in
the war, and probably he saw a lot of futile violence. I think he died in
1919 or 1920? I recall reading sentiments from him to the effect that the
war was the only way to birth the new world. poetry is always in conflict
with itself. art is dead but sneaks out for fun. art is invisible, slips
past the border. I wonder if he conceived it analogically as war against
Germany/war against the forces of dullness, or what? one can imagine, for
instance, many feeling the necessity and 'righteousness' of the second world
war, ie, war against fascism and totalitarianism, for instance. i wonder how
that dynamic played concerning the first world war? but i doubt it was a
general fondness for war and violence, on the part of Apollinaire--could be
wrong though. I don't read the same sort of completely uncritical worship of
the machine and orneriness in Apollinaire that I read in some of the Italian
Futurists, for instance.

Apollinaire, in L'Esprit Nouveau et les Poetès (1917):
"Typographical artifices worked out with great audacity have the advantage
of bringing to life a visual lyricism which was almost unknown before our
age. These artifices can still go much further and achieve the synthesis of
the arts, of music, painting, and literature ... One should not be
astonished if, with only the means they have now at their disposal, they set
themselves to preparing this new art (vaster than the plain art of words) in
which, like conductors of an orchestra of unbelievable scope they will have
at their disposal the entire world, its noises and its appearances, the
thought and language of man, song, dance, all the arts and all the
artifices, still more mirages than Morgane could summon up on the hill of
Gibel, with which to compose the visible and unfolded book of the future....
Even if it is true that there is nothing new under the sun, the new spirit
does not refrain from discovering new profundities in all this that is not
new under the sun. Good sense is its guide, and this guide leads it into
corners, if not new, at least unknown. But is there nothing new under the
sun? It remains to be seen."

It is this sort of dream of a synthesis of the arts, and his
adventuresomeness, his visual writing, that I think of when I think of
Apollinaire.

"The divine games of life and imagination give free rein |to a totally new
poetic activity. {size=36} {enter=zoomOut} {pause=1} |The poet is he who
discovers new joys\n even if they are hard to bear. {enter=wipeLeft} |One
can be a poet in any field: {enter=fade} {exit=none} |it is enough that one
be adventuresome {enter=none} {exit=none} |and pursue any new discovery..."

And also his awareness of but distance from the groups of the time.

Still, I think you're right that it is futile to simply repress the shit in
one's head and pretend it doesn't exist. There's plenty of it. Dealing with
it rather than pretending it doesn't exist is necessary. Acknowleging that
it's there is a start, for sure. Celebrating it as a solution to the world's
or one's own problems, well, we see that celebration quite a bit, don't we.
Policies of preemptive warfare, for instance.

The NSK musical theatre project is called Laibach, not Lübeck. NSK stands
for "Neue Slowenische Kunst," New Slovenian Art. It was founded at the
time when Slovenia was not an independent country.

I often wonder what other poets are reading, especially since so many
good books I've read have been suggestions made by others.

So I decided to e-mail some poets, ask them what they are currently
reading, and to give us one-sentence reviews.

Below is the collected list, hope it inspires your reading.
Many thanks to all the poets who responded,
CAConrad

>> **Please forward to your zine and independent art loving friends!**
>>
>> The Broken Pencil Fall Tour, 2003
>>
>> What?
>> Broken Pencil is on the road! The magazine of zine culture and the
>> independent arts has been chronicling indie activity in Canada since 1995.
>> We will be reading from our own creative works as well as reading
> highlights
>> from the magazine, showcasing zine culture through our travelling zine
>> library, and inviting indie creators from the local community to present
>> their work.
>>
>> Why?
>> In order to spread the word of indie culture and continue to attract
>> readers, writers and interest in the mag. Broken Pencil is an essential
>> cultural resource, but in an age of corporate media it is often difficult
> to
>> find! We want to connect with new communities, meet creators, and
> generally
>> get out there!
>>
>> Who?
>> Broken Pencil is run by a network of creator-writers across the country.
>> However, since we can't take everyone with us, we've settled on three
> people
>> to represent the mag on the tour.
>>
>> They are: Emily Schultz, editor of Broken Pencil. Emily took on the job of
>> editing BP roughly a year ago. Emily runs the ultra-cool Pocket Cannon
>> series of anonymously written chapbooks. She is a freelance writer, and
> her
>> first collection of short stories is Black Coffee Night (Insomniac
> Press),
>> an acclaimed work that explores coming of age in an era of sexual
> confusion
>> and conflicting agendas.
>>
>> Marc Ngui, graphic novelist, regular contributor to BP. From Windsor
> (though
>> now living in TO) Marc's bold new graphic novel Enter Avariz, published by
>> Montreal's Conundrum Press, explores this up and coming talent's growing
>> dread of the monoculture. Bold, outrageous and compelling, Ngui presents a
>> parallel world that looks a little too much like our own. He will be
>> showcasing his work with the help of slides during the tour.
>>
>> Hal Niedzviecki, publisher of Broken Pencil. Founder and former editor of
>> BP, Niedzviecki is a well known critic, media philosopher and fiction
>> writer. An excellent reader and performer, he'll be doing a bit of
>> everything on the tour, exploring ideas presented in his books We Want
> Some
>> Too: Underground Desire and the Reinvention of Mass Culture, and his novel
>> Ditch.
>>
>> How?
>> With a Little Help From Our Friends! This Tour is Sponsored by the Good
>> People of Brave New Waves, CBC Radio 2. Also, each city has at least one

Kent has asked me to forward a last response:


Steve,

OK. And I know what it's like to have a teething baby on your arms. We are obviously considering the notion of the "political" from different perspectives. I proposed The Waste Land as a "powerful political poem" because its despairing ideology registers something crucial about its age, and the poem's broader impacts, in doing so, were hardly merely "conservative" in nature. Authorial intent has only secondarily to do with those impacts. I guess I'm being somewhat old-fashionably "Lukacsian" (though he didn't much care for the poem!) in saying that.

Enjoyed the exchange!

Kent

Press Release:

        Tis of Thee
        by Fanny Howe

        Atelos is pleased to announce the publication on November 30,
2003 of Tis of Thee by Fanny Howe.


About the book:
        With figures X, Y, and Z, Fanny Howe constructs "a repressed but
emotional history" of encounters and unions between races, classes,
genders, and epochs.  Considering race as "the most random quality
assigned to a soul," Howe has undertaken an (American) history of a
racially mixed population. Tis of Thee is a theatrical work originally
written as a series of poems in voices--voices originating in the
intimacies and ruptures of the inter-. In Howe's text the story of two
interracial love affairs concerns both the dialogic and the prophetic:
"X: and Z: Any discussion about race is really a discussion about the
creation of the universe." The work bears evidence to many creative
unions as well: with Ben Watkins, who provided the photographs; with
graphic artist Maceo Senna, who illustrated the text; with Nya Patrinos,
set designer, video artist, and director of the original production; as
well as with composers Miles Anderson and Erica Sharp, whose score adds
another voice to the spoken three. The text includes a CD recording of
the work, originally performed at the Porter Troupe gallery in San
Diego, 1997, with Paul Miles (X), Stephanie French (Y), and Andre Canty
(Z).


About the author:
Fanny Howe is the author of numerous books of poetry and fiction. Among
the most recent of her publications are Economics (Flood Editions), Gone
and Selected Poems (both from the University of California Press), One
Crossed Out (Graywolf), and Saving History and Nod (both from Sun and
Moon). Born in Buffalo, New York, and brought up in Boston, Howe
attended Stanford University.  She has been a recipient of the
prestigious Lenore Marshall Award from the Academy of American Poets, as
well as a Commonwealth of California Award, a National Poetry Foundation
Award, and two Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. She
taught for thirty three years and now lives in New England.


About the project:
        Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of the nonprofit
foundation Hip's Road. Atelos is devoted to publishing, under the sign
of poetry, writing which challenges the conventional definitions of
poetry. All the works published as part of the Atelos project are
commissioned specifically for it, and each is involved in some way with
crossing traditional genre boundaries, including, for example, those
that would separate theory from practice, poetry from prose, essay from
drama, the visual image from the verbal, the literary from the
non-literary, and so forth. The Atelos project when complete will
consist of 50 volumes; Tis of Thee is volume 16. The project directors
and editors are Lyn Hejinian and Travis Ortiz; the editor for cover
production and design is by Ree Katrak; the production assistant is
Colin Dingler.

Press Release:

        Poetical Dictionary
        by Lohren Green

        Atelos is pleased to announce the publication on November 30,
2003 of Poetical Dictionary (Abridged) by Lohren Green.

About the book:=20
        Lohren Green=92s Poetical Dictionary concludes with chaos and
begins with acrobatics. In between these he presents us with =93both a
book of words and a cosmos;=94 a linguistic gas cloud bounded by the
universal and the particular. Green=92s project departs from the
traditional dictionary, a peculiar contraption of sense and order. In
the preface, he reviews the architectures of these teetering, teeming,
linguistic edifices. His attitude towards words is almost that of a
material scientist, exploding an individual specimen of
language=97=93bulwark=94 =93heft=94 =93oyster=94 =93purple=94 =
=93torpid=94 =93foreplay=94=97in order
to ascertain its =93synthesis of body and concept.=94 But the =
heterogeneity,
desire, and tedium contained in such an enormous document as the
conventional dictionary are equally curious to Green, as is the problem
of how to accommodate the plasticity of each word=92s sense. Speaking of
his Poetical Dictionary, Green says, =93Here words are not so much =
defined
as they are depicted in a kind of informed portraiture, a conceptual
calligraphy, a combination of lexicography and poetry=97a lexetry that
knows the style of information, the viscosity of concepts, the
atmospherics of these sonic cum tropic logics that we call
words=94(Preface, xiv). Organized into SUBJECT WORD, PRONUNCIATION,
ETYMOLOGY, and DEFINITION, each entry in the Poetical Dictionary makes
the traditional dictionary hiccup, divulging the stanza within the
standard definition and the wiggle of wit in the pronunciation key.


About the author:=20
        Lohren Green was born in Phoenix, Arizona in 1967, and has since
lived in various cities including Pittsburgh, S=E3o Paulo, Los Angles,
Berkeley and Barcelona. He holds a PhD. In Rhetoric from U.C. Berkeley,
and an M. Phil. in the History and Philosophy of Science from Cambridge
University. He is currently making his way as a sophist in San
Francisco. This is his first book. =20

yes, George.  tho' it's more usually cut from 1960 to 1975.  better yet,
after the Cuban Missile Crisis and by the time Nixon resigned.  Smith will
someday be recognized as one of the most distinctive, yet representatives
voices of said generation musically.

Subject: Re: <nettime> experimental politics of the state

Ryan Griffis quoted a New Hampshire woman on the libertarian Free
State project:

>I don't like to go places that don't let me have my gun," said Ms.
>Casey, 33 ..."I want to be a billionaire in my lifetime " she added,
>"and I don't want to live among people who think that's bad."

In a strange way this does pertain to what I said in the text on the
Tate. NSK created their State in Time while the redrawing of national
borders provided the excuse for practically every gun in the former
Yugoslavia to be fired, at every other one. Today in the Western
nations it's legitimate to work up huge armies to invade countries
which have lots of oil, despite what the majority thinks is right.
The Tate Modern, which in principle is supposed to be about art and
reflexivity, is funded by the same corporations that push the nations
to use their armies. In the United States, the voting machines are
private property and there are people for whom society doesn't exist.
The times are really wierd. At the end of the day in London, after a
pretty searching seminar, two artists named Cornfeld & Cross came up
to tell the story of how they spent loads of public-and-private money
(handing out fifty quid notes in the end as bribes for the
homestretch) to convince a businessman who owned a whole hangar of
airplanes to use a red RAF jet fighter to draw an anarchist symbol in
the sky with smoke. They kept saying they were on the left and how
they felt slightly guilty about this project and how beautiful and
seductive the plane was and how wierd that everybody on the ground
crew looked the other way and one guy spent two hours adjusting two
bolts. The film doesn't show the circle A, it shows you a view from
the camera mounted under the wing (the left wing) and they think the
film shows how beautiful and liberating and peaceful it is to fly.
Art could easily become useless, irrelevant, when the planes fly.
Wherever you live, the state could easily be taken over by, well,
basically, fascists. I think one thing to do is to try and imagine
something different and put the imaginary into tension with the real.
Because the tension itself, the fact that you go on talking with
people you totally disagree with, that you bring out the issues
rather than the gun, is a way to work in this moment. Different,
totally different than the libertarian experiment. It's a matter of
building an idea and a feeling of society, creating a state of desire
and exopectation, a project, a will to change. But that's just my
idea.

best, Brian

As it seems with many - as in a marathon minus cups of water and the
branding minus commodities, as well as attention to "real" jobs - the
managed acreage (bytes) gets (probably gratefully for even the glutton
reader) substantially less crowded across the horizon - or so it appears,
with some exceptions.

Or so it is with my blog - this curiously seductive, addictive companion
that still seeks to challenge all my other bosses!

So just a few small - maybe good - entries and a recent piece I like:

Night Music Plus More Arbus

The eye remains at:

Dear Poets & Writers:

If it may concern you, I have writtin you verse that is worthy of a covr
story and attenshun.  You are skilled and I got bag.  Feel muh power
through ostensive voltage.  I am sad n bad n glad lad.  I am responsable
for the famus "la la la" of the long in shorts.  Barney is bigger than
the both of us.  A song as sweet as you is impossible for me and
Washington DC has attorneys you may retain for a fee to sue the both of
us.  Your cloudy pool is airless and I like that.  You are touching many
people and so touch me too.  Strangulashon breeds suffocatin shooting
ejaculation.  See I am Avant Garde as well as Shooting Guard and
card-carrying member of the New Prescribed. We red together when in
Paris.  Take my picture in black and white.  Here I have prepared
deposits for your vault:

    No one loves me

    I write loveless poetry

    He loves You
    You love Him
    We're a Christian Family

    Charity

    Whitman loved vulgarity

    Misery

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hello, everyone:

Inspired by Chain's call for public forms, the Captain America Project is a
series of four postcards, each featuring the popular comic book hero and
language limited to anagrams for the words "American imperialism" (e.g., "I
am a criminal's empire," etc.).

I've made a small (144kb) PDF that I can send you, which can then be printed
onto card stock and cut into quarters, to create postcards for distribution.

Currently, there are about a dozen people disseminating these cards, from
Hawai'i, Oakland, New York, Maine, Denmark, to Poland. I'd love to have many
more people involved, especially people outside the U.S.

If you'd be interested in having me send you the PDF, please write to me at
gary.sullivan@nmss.org

Thanks!

ëFor a fistful of aid ? not usí - Monday 27, October-2003
by Albert Brandford

IN A carefully aimed backhanded slap at the United States, Barbados has
said no, to ìcrude coercive unilateralismî and vowed never to compromise

fundamental values ìfor a fistful of aidî.

Prime Minister Owen Arthur yesterday urged the faithful at the ruling
Barbados Labour Partyís 65th annual conference to agree to so order this

countryís economic affairs that it would not ever have to go cap in hand

to any institution or country for support.

ìWe now live in a world of strange new political dynamics and
relationships,î he observed.

ìOld values, good values such as constructive engagement, the forging of

alliances and consensus, the respect for diversity, the belief in the
virtue of the rule of law and multilateralism are giving away to a crude

coercive unilateralism.î

According to him, the definition of ìnational interestî was being made
subordinate to how others saw the world and their place and Barbadosí
place in it.

ìThere is the threat of the withdrawal of benefits and the abrupt
cessation of relationships which were carefully negotiated and nurtured
if one does not fall into line, no matter how severely one may have to
offend fundamentally important principles.î

Arthur said Barbados had no interest in picking fights with its
traditional allies or being other than a stable, co-operative and
progressive society within the family of nations.

ìBut I say to the world, we shall never compromise fundamental values
for a fistful of aid.î

The Prime Minister also appealed for tolerance among Barbadians amid a
growing disrespect for the rights of minorities.

ìWe have recently heard a cleric express an intention to lead the
ëmother of all battlesí should Government treat with a matter which that

cleric regards as taboo,î he recalled.

gave birth to WHITE SUPREMACY to justify European conquest

AN HADITH
(story or saying of the prophet (S))

Volume 5, Book 57, Number 37:

Narrated 'Anas:

A man asked the Prophet about the Hour (i.e. Day of Judgment) saying,
"When will the Hour be?"

The Prophet said,
"What have you prepared for it?" The man said, "Nothing, except that
I love Allah and His Apostle." (messenger { RASUL})

The Prophet said,
"You will be with those whom you love."

We had never been so glad
as we were on hearing that saying of the Prophet
(i.e., "You will be with those whom you love.")

Therefore, I love the Prophet,
Abu Bakr and 'Umar, and I hope that I will be with them because of my
love for them though my deeds are NOT similar to theirs.

Subject:      Subpress + Robert Fitterman & Murat Nemet-Nejat | Segue @ BPC
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Segue Series at Bowery Poetry Club presents

Robert Fitterman and Murat Nemet-Nejat
Saturday, November 1
4:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m.
308 Bowery, just north of Houston, NYC
$5.00 goes to support the readers

Back from Italy, Robert Fitterman is once again at home in the city that has
presumably provided at least some inspiration for his much-loved ongoing
series, Metropolis. Two volumes of Metropolis are out: one from Coach House,
and one from Sun & Moon.

Murat Nemet-Nejat is not only one of our most prolific translators (that
Talisman tome of 20th century Turkish poetry should be out next year), but
also an essayist (see The Peripheral Space of Photography, recently
published by Green Integer), and a great poet himself.

SPECIAL DEAL: At 2:00 p.m. the Bowery Poetry Club will host a subpress
collective party -- $5 includes admission to this event AND the reading
above at 4:00!

Readers include: Dan Bouchard, Camille Guthrie, Jen Hofer, Bill Marsh,
Deborah Richards, Prageeta Sharma, Edwin Torres, John Wilkinson

Subpress is a collective supported by members who agree to contribute one
percent of their annual income. Members are responsible for editing books.
The order of publication is determined by lottery.

Hope to see you at both of these events!

Gary

Does anyone know/use a good reliable discount source for HP inkjet
(officejet 6110) ink cartridges??
Revisions are burning ($30/per) holes in my pocket.
As they say on the radio, I will take my answer off the air.
And thanks in advance.

Hi mIEKAL

I use Van Volumes in Palmer, MA. Their telephone is 1-800-290-0462. The
manager is Russ Tate. I've used them for six books. For several years, Potes
& Poets press also used them, as did another respected small press whose
name I forgot. They have the best rates I know of. Mention my name. I figure
if I steer business their way, they'll take better care of me, as well.
Backchannel if you have any other questions.

Vernon

Does anyone have recommendations for a good, cheap short run printer
(300-500 copies perfect bound).  Im especially looking for printers
with whom you've had positive personal experiences, & are reliable &
timely.   mIEKAL

you may want to try thomson-shore (www.tshore.com/) they will do short
runs. not sure about cost, but as far as i know thomson-shore has been
aggressively trying to get jobs (so the bids have been coming in lower
than usual). also try cushing-malloy (www.cushing-malloy.com/).

tell the sales people that you are really trying to find an economical
way to produce your project. they may be able to work with you on the
price.

both thomson-shore and cushing-malloy have been on time with their
production schedules, and they both have been great to work with.

cheers,
travis

Jim Andrews,

I don't want an art that's useful any more than I'd want a friend that's
useful.

In substance, that's the surrealist critique of "progressive" art from
Breton through Bataille.

To be completely useless, to fail to function, to misfire, to laze about,
to daydream, to goof off, etc.

I find the category of the useful to be really menacing, and the
"useless" and "irrelevant" -- what  am I trying to say -- they are not
synonyms.

-- Kirby

Hi Gary---

A great idea. I'd like some (though we'll see what my printer can do with
it---there i go again blaming technology for my luddite-osity).
Anyway, good that you're tying it into that CHAIN thing.
I've been wondering about that---to see if there's a way I can participate
in Spahr/Osman's forum in some way. I hope they go for your idea---
it seemed that they were more interested in public FUNDED art, but I think
ideas like yours are probably more where it's at. Not that I have anything
against Publicly Funded art. It would be nice if it were more within the
realm of possibility/actuality.

Anyway, speaking of which, the other day was a very hot one by SF standards
and there were a bunch of folks riding their bikes up Valencia in the
Mission--all shouting, "DOWN WITH PANTS" and wearing a wide range of
"skivvies" (panties, boxers, jockstraps), etc. There's something there....

hope you're well.

Chris

31.) It's a profound act
of attention
the way you've always wanted
it to rise up
sucking your cuts
and kiss the stray glances

that silk this stillness.
You've always been that
silly. Soaked,
more bone than your owners
or the storms that now will cease,

CEASE! You ain't got music
if you ain't got muscle, OH YEAH!
Pretty fucking stupid

You lie back hot kissing your quills.

I would second this: BookSurge is the

went to create my book. All smooth, not

The Opera series of the movement-moment of the Diva

A series of still images remade on the Zaurus from already issued images
in the http://www.asondheim.org/portal/.nikuko directory.

These are reformed in the http://www.asondheim.org/portal/ directory as
Opera png & jpeg, 22 in all, ordered in terms of broadcast and
disturbance.

What can I say beyond the Victor Frankenstein of my dreams watching his
creature at the edge of the ice, expiring first, the creature tending
towards self-immolation, the incandescent symbol reminiscent of Flaubert's
St-Antoine at the beginning and end of his salvation.

All these males, Elizabeth already on the pyre, everyone ready for a good
time. At the Zaurus prompt, it's like the Image Magick prompt, it's like
the stage prompt, the proscenium shuddering furiously in its tendency
towards distance. People are so small here shuddering.

BOOK REVIEWS


These are books I have been working with recently; I recommend all of
them.

First TECH:

Amazon Hacks, 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools, Paul Bausch, O'Reilly.
This book follows on Google Hacks - there is now a series of Hacks works in
progress. Amazon Hacks is useful, not only for buying and selling, but for
the model of commerce it presents in detail. As a voracious reader, I plan
to use the book in selling some books - only in order to buy others of
course. The chapter sections include Browsing and Searching; Controlling
your Information; Participating in the Amazon Community; Selling Through
Amazon; Associates Program; and Amazon Web Services. I requested the book
as a review copy.

Windows XP Unwired, A Guide for the Home, Office, and the Road, Wei-Ming
Lee, O'Reilly. This book fills a large gap in my library; I don't
understand WiFi that well, and this is enormously useful, WinXP or not.
There are case studies, coverage of infrared and Bluetooth, etc. I've
needed this work. It accompanies The Wireless Networking Starter Kit, The
practical guide to Wi-Fi networks for Windows and Macintosh, Adam Engst
and Glenn Fleishman, Peachpit Press. I'd still like to know why tmobile
goes out every so often on the Zaurus, the details of Wep (which I can
find online), but both of these manuals cover the field for someone just
wanting to get on, wardrive, transfer/transfer/transfer, and so forth.

Two more tech books:

Google Pocket Guide, Tara Calishain, Rael Dornfest, DJ Adams - this is
fine, not nearly as detailed as Google Hacking, but quite useful for
someone who isn't that interested in programming with the Web API. (This
is also a requested book.)

The Official Blender Gamekit, Interactive 3d for Artists, Ton Roosendaal
and Carsten Wartmann, Blender. I just ordered this; it comes with Blender
Creator, and 10 sample games - all of which can be modified. I'm really
excited about playing around with this. The Publisher version is 2.24;
Blender is moving towards 3.0 and a new gamekit, so this was on sale ($35
US). What can I say? I love Blender, its small footprint, quirkiness,
ability for fast-fast modeling (as long as it isn't human!), and so
forth. It's one of the few programs that have let me constantly amaze
myself. You should have some knowledge of Blender itself before using this
book, but there is an introduction in it, and it does come with the 2.28
version.

Onto other work:

Hacker Culture, Douglas_Thomas, Minnesota. I love this book; it's the best
analysis of the title concept I've seen (although Levy's Hackers runs a
close second, as old as it is). It's not based on tech or exploits, but on
analysis from within and without - internal phenomenology of hacking and
hacking communities, and cultural studies analysis of the reception of
hacking etc. within the social - ranging from film to legislation. The
sections follow suit: The Evolution of the Hacker; Hacking
Representation; and Hacking Law. There are sections on Phrack and the
"Hacker Manifesto" - I couldn't ask for better. The epilogue goes over
Mitnick/Lamprecht. I recommend this book to everyone interested in
computer culture.

A Mind So Rare, The Evolution of Human Consciousness, Merlin Donald,
Norton. I'd read and loved his Origins of the Modern Mind - and mind you,
I'm very wary of titles like these - but the books are exceptional, and
offer a foundation for thinking about mind in relation to the external
world - ranging from hammers to computers, digging to databanks. (I had to
try at the alliteration.) David Antin mentioned A Mind So Rare to me; I
hadn't known about it. Antin's recommendation is _always_ worthwhile; I'd
argue this book is a necessity in thinking through the philosophy of
information, philosophy of consciousness, cog psy, and so forth.

Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace; and The Future of Ideas, The Fate of
the Commons in a Connected World, Lawrence Lessig, Basic Books and Random
House. Both of these books are exciting - they deal with code,
legislation, community, the "commons," and other issues relevant to the
present and future of the Net. Now that we have 30 billion spams a day -
over 60% of all email - the issues he discusses are absolutely crucial.
I would also advise _everyone_ to join the Nettime email list, which
discusses cultural/political issues; Lessig has been one of a number of
reference points.

Snap To Grid, A User's Guide to Digital Arts, Media, and Cultures, MIT,
Peter Lunenfeld - one of the most intelligent books I've seen on digital
aesthetics. From Stelarc to jodi to listservs, the work is an immensely
valuable guide and analysis of the digital domain. It's already 2 years
old, but doesn't seem dated - but then perhaps the 'classic' era of
digital art/media is already past.

Collective Intelligence, Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace, Plenum.
Post Deleuze/Guattari/Fuller/perhaps de Chardin visionary - irritating
like the Krokers can be irritating (well, not _that_ irritating) but
exciting at the same time; it gives some sort of distant spirituality or
otherness to what we're doing at the moment. Makes me feel good and the
analysis is fascinating.

Some other work I'm reading at the moment:

The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development, Carl Boyer,
quite quite old Dover book, but for me really useful in thinking about the
ontology of infinitesimals and the continuum. It does come before
Robinson's work on infinitesimals, so its development is classic, but
extremely detailed.

Opal, A Life of Enchantment, Mystery, and Madness, Katherine Beck, Viking,
which just came out. If you haven't read the work of Opal Whiteley, you
should; it's almost unbelievable - I'd recommend Hoff's edition of the
Mystical Nature Diary. Her work and life have been crucial for my own
thinking of the natural world and issues of naming - even though the Diary
was written by and large when Whiteley was 6. (No, I'm not exaggerating.)

Frankenstein, Mary Shelley. I'd never read this before and was astonished
at the incandescence of the writing and the fulfillment of romantic
destiny - it is _nothing_ like any of the popularizations I've seen.

Studies in Chinese Folklore and Related Essays, Wolfram Eberhard, Indiana,
1970. This is wonderful; there are translations of pounding songs,
children's essays, poems scrawled on walls. I haven't seen any of this
literature before, and the Eighteen Short Men, Eighteen Red Men, etc.
pounding songs are amazing. I'm always excited when new domains open up in
the world and suddenly one is born anew - it's like that.

Saving the Image, Art after Film, Tanya Leighton and Pavel Buchler,
editors, CCA/MMU, complete with a long essay by Tom Zummer among others
(Laura Mulvey, Chrissie Myles, John Waters, etc.). I just received this
(from Tom; I'm mentioned in his essay), but the issue is an important one
to many of us who have moved from film's physicality through video's
mechanisms to flash memory, packets, and the electromagnetic spectrum.

The Medieval Castle, Life in a Fortress in Peace and War, Warner, Penguin
- if you're interested in the theme, and I am.

Montaigne and Melancholy, The Wisdom of the Essays, M.A. Screech. I've
always liked the Essays; this book transforms them in relation to theory
of body, ecstasy, self, and melancholy itself. I'm rarely interested in
litcrit, but this work is rather amazing, opening up new territories of
the text. Rather old, 1983, republished with new intro by Penguin in 1991.

Of course if you haven't looked at Wolfram's A New Kind of Science (there
was also a great review of this in Dr Dobbs a while ago) - please please
do - the paradigm is easy to understand, the writing lucid, examples
exciting, programming somewhat easy if you want to go that way, and the
weight of the thing will make a great doorstop.

I've also been reading the poetry of Nada Gordon on and off for months
now, and really love the intensity, interstitial writing, and sheer
quality of language. Just thought I'd mention it.

Also:

The Selected Prose of Fernando Pessoa; some books on Korean for tourists;
Sibley's guides to birds and bird behavior; Heisenberg's The Physical
Principles of the Quantum Theory; the most recent Sara Paretsky novel,
Blacklist, more of Shelley, Mary Shelley's notebooks...


- I've wanted to cover a lot of this territory, particularly the opening
technical works, for a long time. Hope this at least interests you.

Many thanks.

Only a puppet would stay in line
Only a fool criticize
Claimin they ain't blind
My people will follow Victory
Unfrozen by intimidation by the petty
Ain't no fearin rap bullets
Until you fuct with a literary critic
There are many who witness this
No fear can corrupt tru logic
>From Satchmo to this loco
I make legends notice
8+1
The battle's only begun
It's my destiny
My daddy's history
Don't get in the way of me
I'm older see
Trained in the army
I still care bout the seeds
And life ain't been easy
Surrounded in a city
With snakes with no pity
But there ain't no chip
Within my proximity
No zone can be frozen
To fam with the knowledge
We can work together
For the better of our people
Or you'll see how uncivilized
Your cypher can Bee
You feelin me

*** The Human Rights Coalition (HRC) is an organization which works with
prisoners' families, ex-prisoners, and current prisoners (those most
affected by the prison system) to lead the movement against prison
growth. HRC was
started a year ago in Philadelphia by currently incarcerated individuals and
their family members, and since then has grown tremendously. The basic
premise of HRC's organizing is simple: that prisoners' families are
rarely talked
about as victims in criminal proceedings. They are thrust into a
situation where
they have to deal with a judicial system that is often alienating and
hostile
toward them.

HRC seeks to bring these situations to light and to let prisoners' families
know they are not alone, that they are in fact part of a growing mass of
people. HRC also seeks to fundamentally change the prison system, to
shift
from a punitive to a rehabilitative model that allows these families'
loved ones
to come out of the experience with dignity and options.

Reply to: Could Someone Recommend a Good Cheap Short Run Printer:

If we're talking about books: For conventional publishing 500+ copies
I recommend Thomson-Shore and McNaughton-Gunn, both in Michigan. For
smaller press runs, using the new print on demand technology we've
used Publishers Graphics at http://pubgraphics.com and NetPub at
http://netpub.com. There are dozens of these print on demand printers
out there: others we've looked at are Fidlar-Doubleday, Book Surge,
and Lightning Source. Book Surge and Lightning Source also offer a
distribution system. The quality for the print on demand is not up to
conventional printing, but it's good enough for many purposes. They
print either from files, or they can scan previously printed
materials. (That's how we republished So Going Around Cities -
printed by Publishers Graphics.) We also use print on demand for
galleys. I just ordered 15 copies of a perfect bound book with a four
color cover for less money than going to the local copy store. ($203)

Last March - as dispatched on this list - a Gothics News Service article
reported (below) on a proposed combined Heritage and New American Century
Foundation Conference in which Ariel Sharon and his Israeli consultants wer=
e
to be invited to discuss scenarios for preemptive  assassinations, as well
as wall and fence building techniques to combat resistance and civil strife
in a "post war" Occupied Iraq. News of the first fence - preliminary, one
may well imagine, for a contract to build a formal wall - is reported as
follows in today's Washington Post:

=B3=8A.Starting about midnight Thursday, U.S. soldiers, Iraqi police and civil
defense forces moved into this small dusty village about six miles southeas=
t
of Tikrit.=20

Soldiers erected a fence of barbed wire, stretched over wooden poles, and
laid spirals of concertina wire around the perimeter of the village. Local
Iraqi workmen were hired to help erect the fence.

Meanwhile, groups of soldiers were positioned in dugout holes at strategic
points surrounding the village and Bradley armored vehicles provided

Heritage Foundation and Project for The New American Century Seek to Dispel
Sharon Rumor

Washington, D.C., GNS, March 11, 2003. The Heritage Foundation and the grou=
p
called Project for the New American Century (PNAC) sought to dispel rumors
of plans for a joint spring symposium under the auspices of
MillenniumMoveOn, a new joint umbrella organization. According to rumors,
Ariel Sharon and his associates have been invited to address two subjects:
"Preemptive Assassinations: Furthering the Foundations of Democracy" and
"Wall Materials and Strategies to Secure and Protect Indigenous
Populations." =20

The two nonprofit Foundations, both considered major Think Tanks and
essential contributors to the development of the Bush Administration=B9s
global policies, are said to be developing white papers on new
administrative controls for Iraq once the planned war has achieved its
immediate military aims.

Expertise in "Preemptive Assassinations" is considered essential to
eliminating the leadership of any internal Iraqi or outside groups that may
aggressively challenge or terrorize the military and political authority of
a United States-led Occupation. Ariel Sharon=B9s example in dealing with the
Hamas and other groups in the West Bank and Gaza has apparently been
accepted by the Bush Administration and is now considered the most efficien=
t
way, when required, to deal with both armed and unarmed civilian opposition
groups.

The interest in Israel=B9s wall-building strategy to contain the Palestinian
challenge, including the discussion of appropriately engineered wall
materials, is also being considered as potentially essential to controlling
conflicts between Iraq=B9s rival national, tribal and religious groups among
the Kurds and Sunni and Shi=B9a Muslims.

In the case of a Balkanized Iraq, the United States military Occupation
forces will be obligated to maintain strict control of newly established
and/or artificially imposed internal borders. It is now, in fact, rumored
that portable, sustainable walls are in development to extend for hundreds
of miles, which experts say will serve as the most efficient means of
population containment and pacification.

The walls will be built to house complete surveillance and weapon needs.
Their smooth Teflon surface is impossible for civilians to slip over and
they are considered graffiti resistant. Wall panels are also said to unlock
conveniently to permit the passage of military and transport equipment for
the secure maintenance of food delivery, imported commodities and oil
operations.

"This is one more flagrant example," both organizations complained, "used b=
y
the American and European left to demonize Israel=B9s democratic leadership.
These accusations are totally false. Indeed, they are what some may
interpret as anti-Semitic insinuations, obviously aimed to undercut
President Bush=B9s entirely legitimate democratization objectives for Iraq.
The world is going to be deeply surprised by how well we are received by
Iraqis who are innocent victims of Saddam=B9s torturous dictatorship."

The White House and the Israeli Consulate refused to comment on what are
still considered rumors and unsubstantiated implications of the proposed
Conference. The Internet has no current website listing for a
MilleniumMoveOn organization, nor could any other source reveal a published
mission statement for the creation of the new umbrella group alleged to
combine the objectives for these two conservative and frequently Bush
Government-aligned organizations.

***
One assumes the Gothix staff - if they are still around - are happy, if not
also grieved, that their original news story in March was and remains on th=
e
mark.

This year in Baghdad most of the kids will dress as Arabs for Hallowe'en,
but some will dress as soldiers. Parents are advised to check the treats
for explosives.

Friends

As many of you know, I am one of the 261 people being sued by the RIAA for
downloading music on the internet. To help with my legal fees, as well as to
have a funky good time, we are having a FREE TIMMY party at our studio on
45 White Street #4
Saturday, November 8

There will be an open studio from 7-10 P.M.
followed by a raging dance party fueled by Bambouche of the Vanguard Squad.
This party will serve as my birthday party and I am asking everyone NOT
to bring presents, but rather to buy a
FREE TIMMY T-shirt
which will be for sale at the party for $25.00, all profits going
to my legal defense.

Please come and please do forward this to anyone who might be interested.

Thank you,
Tim Davis

Rumsfeld will wear a Bush mask--a Rumsfeld mask would scare the other children.

(I normally don't send things from the company I work for thru the
lists, but this latest blasphemy from the FDA is much too doomsday
scenario to ignore.  The important thing here is to send a letter to
your congress person.  If you do not want to get further mailings from
Organic Valley remember to uncheck the Farm Friends box-- mIEKAL)


FDA Should Rescind Cloning Support!

Once man-made species are introduced into the environment there is no
"calling them back."  Whether it's genetically engineered crops cross
pollinating with wild weeds, genetically modified salmon breeding with
wild fish, or future concerns with cloned mammals, the risks to the
balance in ecosystems worldwide are great.   American families should
not be guinea pigs for corporate greed! Contrary to what the F.D.A.
says, there is no level of 'acceptable risk' when it comes to putting
unproven science on the table for dinner.

"By allowing foods from cloned animals into the food system without
proof of their long-term effects on human, animal and environmental
health, the F.D.A. is not protecting the consumer. The F.D.A. is
furthering their support of the abhorrent attempt by corporate
interests to control the genes of our citizenry," warned George Siemon,
CEO of Organic Valley. Send an email from the Farm Friends Action
Center now demanding that the FDA change their position!
