Anything by Lydia Cabrera. Susan Levine has translated some of the stories.
If you have Spanish go to Cabrera's _El Monte_, as close to a bible as
santeria has, and the source, alas, for almost all of the "original" work in
English since the 50's. Also check out Verges (I've forgotten first name),
the great student of Condomble in Brazil. For that you'll need French.
Thompson's Flash of the Spirit is readily available, but highly unreliable.
Susan Sherman translated a Cuban play about santeria possession years ago,
called, if I remember her spelling, Chango de Ima. Also check out Barbara
Myerhoff's _Peyote Hunt_, and a look at Victor Turner's performance theory
stuff would probably be helpful. I second the Hurston--a great book. Maya
Deren also wrote about this at about the same time.

mystification. I do think that most complex poetry (take the term as you
like) is for most people an acquired taste. The product of a Rousseauean
education that no one is likely to receive anyway, may chant his native
woodnotes wild, but that may not help him a whole lot with, say, Pound, or
Stein, or (fill in whoever you like). But that potential reader is more
likely to have his/her curiosity peaked to make the effort if she/he has a
memory of pleasurable associations with the idea of poetry. Like, maybe that
person will want to look at the poetry section in the bookstore, or even
share discovered poems with friends. But the theme cunningly hidden in the
foliage idea of poetry as expounded by HS teachers who likewise are not
particularly excited by poetry--any poetry--is not likely to facilitate that
response.

>But let's call a spade a spade here. All teaching has an authoritarian
element. We teach what we know, but also what we think the students should
know, whether it's computer skills or the three rs or fly fishing. And the
arts, any art, is also of necessity authoritarian--we hope, I think most of
us, that our poems will act upon the reader and listener, perhaps not always
in predictable ways, but it's us who lay out the parameters (not to slight
the reader's part in this--no matter how active the reader may be, if I
don't at least join him in saying play ball he'll play in someone else's
field, if at all), and it's us who are saying, "look at this, look at that"
out of the limitless field that's available. I'm aware that I may be both
poet and audience, but I don't think that changes the dynamic) We do this
because it's important to us, for reasons that are both various and obscure.
Not everyone feels the need or desire to do so.

check out the Maria Sabina material, the Mazatec shamaness who used mushrooms to get
into a healing trance & thus "possessed" (silly word) composed & performed her chants
-- I don't know if the book is still in print, but you can find extracts in a number of

& throw in this jumble of books anything by ethnobotanists Richard

entheogenic plants & ritual--

& our group, The Driftless Academy of Botanical Apparitions has a 45
minute video called "The Lady of the Gourd, & her Fertility" of a
fertility ritual we performed as Minneapolis College of Art & Design.
We went to the space in may of the year, built a 25 foot log tower
(looked kinda like a boy scout signal tower) & planted gourds when spent
the summer growing up it & covering this huge tower.  Later in oct we
invoked a fertility ritual with Lyx as the nascent gourdess coming into
being as the gourds are harvest & the tower in brought down.
(Unfortunately the Minneapolis fire department wouldnt give us a permit
to burn it down, so we got this crazy pyrotechnicist instead.)

Aldon & others who responded to my original post--thanks for the other
titles.I couldn't respond sooner--computer problems at home. It was the
image of Sonny Rollins that made me try reading the proem "to Brooklyn
Bridge" in the first place--I mentioned him first, his woodshedding there,
then read the Crane over the Mingus (band's selection) & went into Paul
Blackburn's poem "Listening to Sonny Rollins at the Five Spot" (CP 316).
That poem tries to catch the way Rollins fragments a melody in a solo, by
fragmenting the lyrics to "There Will Never Be Another You." Jay Bregman,
sax, played it. Last poem was Blackburn's "Barrel Roll," one of my
favorites, also with gulls, the East River, the bridge, and the feel of a
jazz solo. The set worked pretty well, though I didn't do well by the Five
Spot one--that should be more sung, more melodic than I did it.
     As for the other post, yes, I see Crane down there listening to
Rollins ("Under thy shadow by the piers I waited,") & I can almost make out
what he's doing in those shadows with Whitman!

Comments: cc: jrothenb@ucsd.edu

As a followup to Pierre's note regarding Maria Sabina and the above query,
it surprised me that while he mentioned my own anthologies, he forgot to
say that there's an excerpt from her veladas (night chants) in his and my
Poems for the Millennium.  I also have excerpts in the revised Technicians
of the Sacred and in Shaking the Pumpkin, both of which should still be
easily available.  The Maria Sabina book in question (gathered by fellow
Mazatecan Alvaro Estrada and translated into English by Henry Munn) was
published by now defunct Ross-Erikson Publishers and is, I suppose, now
only available through libraries.

Technicians of the Sacred was my own opening shot on questions of this
sort, which seemed to me then (& now) as very much tied up with the sources
of poetry etc. & persistent even among many of us who pretend a distance
from such matters.  I think here of David Antin with his overt denials
of the sacred and the dream, say -- & his retreat in the latter case at
least after that strategy had run its course.  (Since David is my oldest
friend in all of this, I know whereof I speak.)  But I would also suggest,
among others, that Robert Duncan remains an outstanding guide on matters
of that kind, although the performance question was never that much
central to him.  Dennis Tedlock's works (& Barbara Tedlock's too) would
be good examples of dealing with the traditionally (ethnopoetically)
spiritual and not descending into any version of new-agism.

Anyway it seems to me that this is touching on a crucial problematic of
twentieth-century poetry (and much of the 19th before it) -- certainly
on the question of poets' and artists' relations to other times & places
& to their own workings & concerns.  Take as intros to the twentieth
century such works as Kandinsky's Spritual in Art or Mallarme's The
Book, Spritual Instrument.  And the title of the latter is also that of
the latest publication I've attempted -- a gathering of works &
specuations on contemporary & ethnopoetic (traditional) approaches to
the book (including, let me add, the book as an instrument of
performance).

The books (from my own workings) that are still in print are Technicians,
Shaking the Pumpkin, Exiled in the Word (retitling of A Big Jewish
Book), and Symposium of the Whole (essays & poetics by various hands,
co-edited with Diane Rothenberg).  Notably out of print are Revolution
of the Word (where the theme remains beneath the surface) and America
a Prophecy (co-edited with George Quasha) where it's very much writ large.
And the new anthology with Pierre gets at it from Blake to Jabes, say,
& in the second volume brings it toward the present.

Okay & greetings.

JERRY

Deren also, not surprisingly, made a film also titled "Divine Horsemen"
-- It IS available on video, though probably not at your local
Blockbuster --

Two students just gave me the video of "Pull My Daisy" as a gift -- Not
sure what I think of it as film yet -- but Kerouac's narration (adapted
from his "Beat Generation" play) was much better than I'd expected --

will provide title of that Baraka story Maria mentions later today --
it's in my room across campus

(Yes, I'm actually living ON campus this semester -- never did it when I
was a student -- Now I can see why it might not have been such a good
idea at age 19)

i just picked up mouth=maul=betrayer, it's fantastic! thanks herb.  one thing
that strikes me as very charming and strange is the fascination with the
minutiae of jewish gangster life, obviously carefully researched and following,
it seems, walter benjamin's all-too-well-founded alarmist dictum that no piece
on information or detritus of a culture is too negligle to saved --all glossed
with the note that the compositions "evoke a side of Jewish experience perhaps
best forgotten."  typically hebronic logic!  md

I'm sending this message a second time, as I have no idea if it's getting
through--it's not getting back to me. I'd appreciate if someone on the list
would tell me if it's been posted.

Anything by Lydia Cabrera. Susan Levine has translated some of the stories.
If you have Spanish go to Cabrera's _El Monte_, as close to a bible as
santeria has, and the source, alas, for almost all of the "original" work in
English since the 50's. Also check out Verges (I've forgotten first name),
the great student of Condomble in Brazil. For that you'll need French.
Thompson's Flash of the Spirit is readily available, but highly unreliable.
Susan Sherman translated a Cuban play about santeria possession years ago,
called, if I remember her spelling, Chango de Ima. Also check out Barbara
Myerhoff's _Peyote Hunt_, and a look at Victor Turner's performance theory
stuff would probably be helpful. I second the Hurston--a great book. Maya
Deren also wrote about this at about the same time.

All them christian mystics, incl. Sts Teresa and Francis and tons and tons
of others. There's also a pretty extensive sufi literature, also some Jewish
esoteric, but someone else onthe list will have to give the details on this.
If this thread continues we might produce a master bibliography. We also
might use up a lot of gigabytes.
Whatever blurs the boundaries. Beware the man from Porlock.

Hi Luigi,

Since you sent this to the list, I'll respond here too.

I don't have an address for Tzadik at hand, but the label is distributed by
Koch International and should be available at many larger record stores:
Tower, HMV, Borders, etc.  In the US you can call 800 688-3482.

or there's a Web site

<http://kochint.com/tzadik.html>

As I mentioned to most of the folks who back channelled me on this, if you
go to a store, you'll probably get better results if you start out asking
about John Zorn's label Tzadik, rather than about Zeena Parkins or
Rotwelsch.

As to the review, I probably don't have time, but,  Luigi, is TRR branching
(sorry) out further into new music now, or is this a one time offer?

Bests

Herb

There's a recording of Blackburn reading this on an old Folkways disc (New
Jazz Poets Folkways 09751) & he doesn't sing it.  He does try to capture
some of the rhythmic quality of the song, though.

 ANY of the old Folkways recordings can be obtained on cassette from
Smithsonian Folkways Mail Order, 414 Hungerford Dr, #444, Rockville, MD
20850, or (800) 410-9815
or check the Web site:

<http://www.si.edu/folkways/start.htm>

They have a lot of amazing stuff (not just music and poetry either - Sounds
of the Junkyard, Tony Schwartz' great field recordings of New York City,
and much more).

Does anyone know the correct tonal pronunciations for "gung hay fat choy"?
I'm reading some stuff to some people in a room on Saturday night in DC
and I want to welcome them to the new Ox Year but don't want to tell a
roomful of people by mistake that their mothers eat army boots, or
something. If I were going to do that I'd want to do it on purpose.

Can anyone help?

The Baraka story Maria mentioned is titled "The Screamers" -- first
collected in _Tales_, subsequently reprinted in _Three Books by Amiri

as Maria said, not exactly an instance of spirit possession, but
certainly about getting the spirit -- suggest listening to Sun Ra live at
Montreaux whilst reading this tale --

The address for Tzadik is:

61 East Eighth Street
Suite 126
New York, NY  10003


I believe they've also released a disc by Ben Goldberg's "New Klezmer
Trio," a group based in the Bay Area and composing/performing music similar
to Zorn's and Parkins'in its sources, though the outcome differs somewhat.
They also, incidentally, released another of Parkins' discs a few years
back -- one which I don't have and the title of which I can't recall
(though I'm hoping Herb or someone can refresh me here) -- that's
absolutely extraordinary. The base material is North African...

Nathaniel Mackey's recent books -- and particularly the two novels thus far
published from the trilogy "From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still
Emanate" -- deal with possession in music (referentially) and in writing
(performatively -- the text seems quite possessed at times by the music it
invokes). These might also be good sources for some of the Sufi experiences
that Mark Weiss mentions...

This may not be exactly the information that was being asked for, but:
Would it be going too far to suggest that Jack Spicer's writing by
dictation and Hannah Weiner's clairvoyant poems are in some sense texts of
possession? (I'm sure there are others who could be included in this
question...

        Whoa! what galloping screeching halting turn-on-a-dime and kiss my ass
stanzas make up Dominique Fourcade's Click-Rose, new from Sun & Moon,
rendered to us American English readers through the hypersensitive alembic of
Keith Waldrop's ear.  It's a clinodromic booklength sequence.  His rose a
sthenic, moving target of surprises in syntax diction tone and pulse.
 Hilarious.  And lovely in its inclusiveness of friends, art, history, books,
what a rich broth!  It's like ladling yourself a bowl of soup and a horse
spills out.  No, that's a simplifying metaphoric wholesale error: it is roses
that spill out, "blatently howling roses."  And it is the only rosary I will
ever count on to restore my soul.  If you ain't yet read it, what an
electric/eclectic/clitic pleasure awaits you.

I have been teaching _Mumbo Jumbo_ since it came out; and recently read

 I dont know whether anyone here has mentioned a terrific new mag called
_Collapse_. Calling it a magazine isnt doing it justice. It is more than
that. The second issue, called "The Verbal and the Visual", has several
works on Robin Blaser, including articles by Charles Watts and Charles
Berstein. It also includes a CD with the voices of Blaser and Roy Kiyooks.

It's Kevin Killian.  I second the recommendation by George Bowering is
"Collapse 2, The Verbal and the Visual."  It's really fine from cover to
cover.  Besides the features on Blaser and Kiyooka, there's a long article
on Emily Carr (a transcript of a round table discussion by many eminent
Carr scholars); as well as an interesting never before printed manifesto by
Robert Smithson.

However I should point out one error . . . in the section about Blaser I am
given the credit for bringing the Helen Adam collages from Buffalo to
Vancouver in 1995.  This credit belongs to the poet Kristin Prevallet.  I'm
sorry, Kristin!  This seems to be happening to you all the time!  This
wasn't my fault either!  (The coffee table book "Women of the Beat
Generation" by Brenda Knight has a lengthy account of Helen Adam almost
entirely lifted from Prevallet's pioneering research into Adam's life and
work, yet signed by Knight.)  More on this later.  In the meantime, order
"Collapse."

Fourcade's fans will also want to read "Compact pour Claude," his lengthy
catalogue essay printed at the end of "Laque sur Polaroid," the collection
of Claude Royet-Journoud's painted-over photographs (Michel Chandleigne,
1996).  The photographs themselves are quite startling, anatomical
close-ups of a vagina in the Hustler style.  L'Etat vs. Larry Flynt.  I was
so impressed by "Laque sur Polaroid" that I wrote to Paris and offered
Royet-Journoud the use of my own genitals for a sequel.  He demurred.
Pourquoi pas?

Thinking about poetry and possession brought to mind poor Yeats in the
classroom, realizing that, despite the watchful eyes of the nuns and his
desperate desire to behave properly, he is falling into a sexual revery
about a little girl. And suddenly he gives into the revery and finds himself
transported to a brutal figuration of generativity and destructiveness, of
the erotic refusing to be tamed to the appropriate. The life built by the
public man can be torn apart in a second, and the whole world with it. It's
Red Hanrahan, the hero of his early stories, being carried off by the
fairies all over again, the victim of their inhuman purity of impulse. And
where does that leave you?

I don't know if all poetry is a form of possession, but I think it is, even
the set-pieces of the Augustans. There's the sense that no matter how we try
to train ourselves we can become at best receptive--the poem seems to come
when it wants to and to leave when it wants to, unless we try to constrain
it to our preconceptions, in which case we certainly lose it. And it's no
respecter of occasions, so that those who have the weakness or good fortune
to be on the receiving end often find themselves less than well-fitted to
the time-constrained, appropriate world.

I don't for a minute think that we relinquish choice in the moment of
possession--I'm not sure how completely humans ever do. For one thing, the
field in which our possessed selves operates is the field we bring to the
experience. And the momentary changes and impulses are directed, by what
comes before, but also by the changes in a chemistry whose stability is
always fragile. We learn, we enlarge the field, but it's still the field,
and the physiology, we brought to the game.

Even when we sleep we make choices. On the crudest level, it's no accident
that Freudians have Freudian dreams, Jungians have Jungian dreams, and
Pharaohs dream about sheaves of corn. What we relinquish is the conscious
awareness and direction of choice.

Rituals, whether it's parlor-game tarot readings or the I Ching or the more
serious committment of the otherwise decorous old woman in a NY or Havana
barrio who becomes the horse of Shango and insists on throwing up her skirts
to show the crowd how much bigger her cock is than theirs, are about choices
faced in what Van Gennep called a liminal or marginal state--between
statuses, in transition from known to knowable, a place without rules. The
known and the knowable are always under seige, because it's not so much that
we're on occasion in a stable place as that the rate of change slows down.
Change is the constant. The poem is situated in that awareness, and to the
extent that we have the courage to stay there it inhabits the liminal, which
is by its nature formless. And the poem grounds itself in the particular
because that's all there is to hold onto, and the only clues offered.

It's the willful relinquishing of resistance to liminality. And it differs
from the ritual practice of possession because, unlike the ritual, which, if
done properly, always brings the participant out the other end (imagery of
rebirth is inevitable her)it has no preordained pattern, no liferope, no
social structures surrounding it that announce when the participant has
reached the new place and what place that is.

This sounds like the fugue state of psychosis, but in fact the crazy rarely
will themselves to relinquish the inhibitions to behaviors seen as crazy and
to the internal states that drive those behaviors. They really know that
they may not be able to come back. I once asked a group of for-the-moment
stable schizophrenics about a fantasy. They exchanged a few panicy glances
and then assured me, one after the other, in the manner of well-behaved
school-children, that they didn't have fantasies.

Somewhere the poet has the sense that there's an internal structure to
escape to when the game gets too wild, and it's that faith that gives him
the courage to dive in when he's able. Yeats, for instance, knows that he's
not about to throw himself on that little girl, although he may allow
himself to court the danger. The internalized self-definition as Poet, which
contains within it the privilege to depart from the everyday to bring back
news from the margins, is a part of that structure.

That's as far as I can rant tonight. Prednizone does loosen the tongue, but
it doesn't grant much staying power. Not my drug of choice.

Hi Julie: On the spirit possession thread: Felicitas Goodman, Speaking in
Tongues: A Cross-Cultural Study of Glossolalia, and Ecstasy, Ritual, and
Alternate Reality. Also Marghanita Laski, Ecstasy, and any work by Erika
Bourguignon. And I second the reference to Nathaniel Mackey, whose
communications with the Angel of Dust perform/theorize spirit possession.
See Pedro Pietri's work, too.  The "History & Ecstatic Speech" special session
I organized at the MLA followed through some threads from Susan Stewart's
"Lyric Possession" (in a recent Critical Inquiry) and Nicolas Abraham's work on
transgenerational haunting. Houston Baker & Mae Henderson have done interesting
work on conjuring, tongue speaking. --Kathy Crown

kathy and julie:  it seems that you're both working with similar paradigms of
'inspiration," etc, but in different arenas: kathy in high modern/postmodernist
poetry, julie on the popular front.  how exciting that your work is
complementary.  maybe put together a coupla panels for our Xcp conference? or
future mla panels? this stuff is great, tres hot, and you both deserve a lot of
support and encouragement!

_Heirs of Columbus_ is a great novel -- have taught it ever since first
reading it some years ago -- would also point readers towards Vizenor's
book of essays titled _Manifest Manners_ -- which has much of interest to
say about recent appropriations of American Indian spirituality (and lots
of other stuff besides) --

Am using _The Vizenor Reader_ in a class this semester -- it's OK, and
represents his work in fiction and essays as well (& includes hunks of
his autobiography) -- but find the individual novels and essay books more
satisfying -- (perhaps this is just BECAUSE I've read the books excerpted
in the READER and am thus less happy with less of the text?!)

Gerald Vizenor used to write more poetry too -- but the prose works are
actually more poetic than his haiku in my opinion

Subject:      gold bug

There's been some mention of Richard Power's mind-boggling _The Gold
Bug Variations_ in the past few weeks. I have what I think is an
interesting anecdote.

I've begun reading Shawn Rosenheim's _The Cryptographic Imagination:
Secret Writing from Edgar Poe to the Internet_, and Rosenheim
discusses Powers's book in the introduction. Apparently, *** Beadle
(can't recall his first name), the non-fictional winner of the 1958
Nobel Prize for his research in genetics, enters the novel at a key
point in the story, when Jan O'Deigh learns about an (actual)
encrypted letter sent to Beadle by Max Delbruck. The letter leads to
a kind of epiphany for O'Deigh, which Rosenheim describes as a key
moment in the novel (as you can see, I haven't read it, though I
have read _Galatea 2.2_, which makes me certain that Powers is from
another planet).

Anyway, here's my anecdote: Beadle's grandson, John, was my
roommate in Milwaukee for three or four years in the 70's when the two
of us were working as freight car mechanics on the now defunct
Milwaukee Road and, as members of the Socialist Worker's Party,
trying to win over rail workers to the principles of revolutionary
Marxism. We weren't very successful at this.

John's mother, Joyce, had a Master's in Spanish Literature, and when
she died about three years ago, John called to ask if I would like to
have all of her old Spanish lit books. I said sure, and I soon
received three boxes of (mostly) diligently notated paperbacks, with
stuff ranging from Gongora and San Juan de la Cruz, to Vallejo and
Neruda. About a week ago, I went down to the boxes in the
basement and pulled out a '65 Dell _Lorca: Obras
Escogidas_ and, opening it, found a short and undated holograph
letter from the geneticist Beadle to his daughter. At the end of the
letter Beadle writes the following: "And thank you for the beautiful
old edition of Poe! Reading him again, I am as delighted and riddled
as I was when I first discovered, at 15, 'The Gold Bug' and 'The
Murders in the Rue Morgue.' Poe is full of secrets, and my guess is
that most readers have no idea what he's _really_ up to. Let me know
when you get news on the application. love, Dad."

I'm going to be going down and going through everything in the boxes!
Maybe there's more.

there is the bad 'desert storm' film with Meg Ryan as hero (in) Courage
Under Fire. Also 'Beyond Rangoon' with one of the arquette sisters in Burma
- has the recent Burmese international media star whose name elludes me
right now... Or the Alien films - i realise these amy not exactly be epic -
but Beyond Rangoon at least follows the ol' hero's journey (not very well i
admit). Perhaps also interesting is Hearts of Darkness the Making of
Apocolypse Now which was shot by Copolla's wife - a lot of her work is
comment on life as the hero's wife - makes a nice contrast. & I haven't seen
the new Evita but... ? & i haven't seen the euro pic set in 'Nam with
Deneuve  can't remember the name either sorry , butsomeone may know if this
is worthwhile. Jan Schwankmeir's (sp?) Alice (from alice in wonderland) very
much agendas gender vision, so too i guess would the wizard of Oz but i am
babbling so i will stop,.

also Nikita - read made as 'the assassin' i think, with brigit fonda, about
a female assassin. There are also heaps of Indian & Chinese films that 'use'
a woman's perspective to entertain audiences in epic surroundings.

     Gun laws in Tasmania have tightened post-Port Arthur. But here the new
     restrictions can largely be by-passed by applying for a $5
     authorisation to shoot on both private and government-owned forest
     property. Its a welcome return to sanity, say gun owners. It's a back
     door to by-passing the new regulations, argues the Green movement.

     Part of my job is issuing the authorities to shoot. A chap signing the
     form last week could barely control his pen.  "The bunnies'll be safe
     from you" I joked. Others simply want to preserve family heirlooms.
     "It's for a .303, it was my fathers', I'll never go shooting but I
     don't want to lose it" is a typical response.

I've argued long and hard for the possession of personal nuclear weapons.
New technology with red mercury makes this possible - baseball-sized dirty
limited range bombs to stop them from coming "over the hill." These would
replace the Davey Crockett small atomic arms, basketball sized, heavy, and
extremely difficult to hide.

Perhaps the epic desire for epic is escalating the arms race.

Perhaps not.

Poetics friends and colleagues, a number of responses I've never had time to
type out to various threads in the recent postings have become tangled, or
maybe woven, already in my mind. So I'll share them with you as they are
before I start trying to "craft" them ...

Re: LISTENING: two CDs I want to highly recommend. They also tie in with the
"SPIRIT POSSESSION"  query, in that they are both, in vastly different
musical genres & vocabularies, about expanding or transcending one's
isolated sense of Self, both as musician and as listener:
1) "Ocean of Remembrance" Sufi improvisations and Zhikrs (it's from
Interworld Music in Vermont, but I found it at the Stanford mall so how
obscure can it be?) these are several Turkish musicians and the music
(vocals, oud, rebab, flute etc.) consists of "recitations of the names of god."
2) "Simulated Winds and Cries"  Electronic music by Jim Horton, hauntingly
beautiful, melodic, brash; in the tradition of process music of the 60s,70s
as the pieces are cybernetically generated,  but also profoundly mystical in
that Horton (who lives in Berkeley and has been an invalid in great pain for
years now) says "the programs, running autonomously and slightly beyond my
comprehension, play music I wouldn't have thought of if left to my own
devices." Artifact Recordings, Berkeley.  info@artifact.com

When I need my head "cleared", my chi charged, or whatever, I also listen to
Joshua Redman's "Mood Swing" especially the piece called Sweet Sorrow, to
John Lee Hooker and of course the ever-true Franz josef Haydn.

Re "OTHER PEOPLE'S BOOKS" lining our rooms/heads. No kidding. Being slightly
compulsive, I have a list of every book I've read since high school (a very
long time ago) Every year one or two standout: here is the top of the charts
for the past 12 months or so.
* The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human
World. David Abram. Pantheon, 1996.
* Coming to Our Senses: body & spirit in the hidden history of the west.
byMorris Berman
* THE GIFT: Imagination & the Erotic Life of Property Lewis Hyde
* Jihad vs McWorld Benjamin Barber

I will say a little more about what is so specials to me in these books in
the context of other comments below  ( as I said, it all got braided together)

First, Re "the language that never sits stil"l: I churned up a nifty
neologism this week: the form of society we live in is aptly described as
Demo-Crapitalism.  (Dont get me wrong, I wouldn't trade it for anything else
around at present.)  The word "crap" may offend some, but let's face it ...
even by any other name, this is "the age of stuff", we are all in the Junk
Tribe and consumer goods and global capital is the Game. This game requires
a certain (limited) cognitive mobility of the players (that they have at
least the illusion of making "choices"), hence the "demo" part (as in
demotic.) But the two, as the "collapse" of communism illustrated, are
inextricably linked -- if you want elections, you gotta take coca-cola too.
Barber's thesis is that both Jihad (ie any fundamentalist religious
ideology) and McWorld (global mass-produced corporate product especially
cultural product, e.g.disneyfication) seem to be in conflict but are both
forces that ultimately work against true democracy. Poets will not have dark
satanic mills to point to as the culprit, but a diffuse and intoxicating web
of seductions whose down side is located in other landscapes (Bhopal, the
Tex-Mex border town where babies are born with birth defects due to toxic
dumping ...)

What ties together the above books or seems most crucial about them is the
combination of something "global" with something local -- presence in one's
body. To Miekal's phrase, "terrestrial reclamation" I would add "corporeal
reclamation." That is crucial to my sense of what poetry is and does.

[Given that, I must put in a mention of the book that's on my all-time top
list : Mindfulness in Plain English, flawlessly logical explication and
gentle hand-holding combined. by Ven. Gunaratana (dont let the
unpronounceable name put you off it. I gave it to several friends in Europe
this summer, it has been translated all over the place.) if you are ready to
vaguely consider any kind of meditation or just leaning in the direction of
wondering about what gives with buddhist philosophy and practice, this is a
good straightforward beginning. ]

Oh dear, I see that I have already violated several American taboos, having
brought in both "religion" and "politics", two obscene things we keep
"separate" in America. But with the way literacy rates are going, it wont be
a "problem" for long. "Books just make people unhappy, darling."

This leads me to the more pivotal point. Something triggered  insight this
week as a result of the discussion about LANDSCAPE and its effects upon
poetry and/or thought processes. I find the distinction suburban vs. urban
to be most un-skillful;  it makes a dichotomy out of what is in fact a
continuum -- at what point does city become suburb? the city limits? at x
number of miles from "downtown" (already a fairly ambivalent notion in many
cities. ) And a place like "silicon valley" as this area is now called, does
not meet the former definitions, ie that one worked in the city and lived
out in the sub-urb. So where does the definition go then??

Some months ago my family & I moved "down the peninsula" from San to Menlo
Park, after five years of resistance on my part. All my SF friends bemoaned
my exile to "suburbia". For once, I thought, I'll have a Reason for feeling
like an Outsider. Gradually, I re-rooted, thanks to friends, colleagues,
acquaintances, but especially to non-human allies such as a giant redwood,
ponderosa pines, magnolias and other trees towering over our slightly
ramshackle but harmoniously fen-shui-ed 1920s house, and the crickets and/or
tree frogs that fill the blessedly dry and sage-scented air and encircle us
with their sounds on summer nights. (having a garden 4 times the size of the
one we had in SF is great, especially for our five year old son, the hot tub
in the gazebo and the fireplace are also bonuses tied to being in a less
densely populated area.

I have always been interested in and sensitive... over-sensitive even [see
my article "post-Immunnity or the Princess and the Pea" on my web-site] to
place. This mayu be due in part to having lived in my lifetime in so many
different places including Milan, the Italian Alps, Boston,San Fernando
Valley, Hollywood, New York city, San Diego, Berkeley, British Columbia,
etc.] So I began exploring the local terrain.

We live in menlo Park, just one block north of Palo Alto. Our neigborhood,
the Willows, is bounded by the San Francisquito creek, which wends its way
down from Jasper Ridge ( which the San Andreas Fault straddles), alongside
Stanford University's vast land holdings, and eastward ,to pour eventually
into the San FrancsicoBay alongside the Dumbarton Bridge. It happens (far
from accidentally) that this creek marks, for most of its length, the
boundary between Palo Alto and Menlo Park and between the two counties
(Santa Clara and San Mateo) in which they they are situated. With steep
banks and a wide bed, pale and bone dry in summer, t serves as a discreet
homeless encampment in places. Recent rains turned it into a surge of
mud-brown liquid; then it returned to its usual sinuous green. At one point
alongside the Stanford campus the county linie moves north a half mile (or
the creek slips into Palo Alto, as it were.)  Tis piece of land to its north
is currently the subject of major hot debates in these parts between the
multi-million dollar proposed development of that land and widening of Sand
Hill Rd. to a major artery (it currently sort of dead-ends into the Stanford
Mall's parking lot. But with a newly opened Bloomingdales... well.) versus
the Menlo Park homeowners, the conservationists (open space groups, etc. )
and the claim that the Ohlone Indian burial site nearby must be considered)
and activism by some of those pesky types who don't take things lying down,
whom civilization extinguishes at its own peril.

Well, enough local geo-politics. My point is that landscape to me is a
living and changing thing; in some places we can be more aware of its impact
upon our lives, but the effects are always there.  I loved San Francisco,
but it is mainly the buildings and human history and rich collage of culture
one experiences there.  The hills, the fog, the Bay even, they are
background.  Where you are is Haight Street or Chinatown or on the Bridge or
in the Mission or the Castro, each with its odors, sounds, smells, its
human-scape.

I was in Hawaii recently for the first (in Maui, named after an indigenuous
trickster figure who coerced the sun into making longer days for half the
year. ) Took my son to look at the primordial confrontation of lava fields
with ocean at LaPerouse Bay. Watched with a sense of uplift one afternoon a
whale sporting itself quite close to shore ... great surge of interest by
all at poolside, ooh aah, an enormous wild mammal so nearby, so far, so
powerful, so vulnerable. (I thought of Berman's premise in Coming to Our
Senses. In a chapter called "The Wild & the Tame", he proposes that the loss
of a sentient Other to reflect us back to ourselves is a great spiritual
impoverishment for our civilization. He cites zoos and even pets as poor,
sad substitutes for that lost crucial experience.)

There I was in the middel of the Pacific Ocean. I could feel it, how benign
nature felt, yet how at any moment it could wipe us out with a typhoon or a
tsunami.  The songs of the different species of birds, extravagant flowers
growing everywhere, with names like hibiscus, cymbidium, protea ...  and
yet, it was all so ... normal.  The beauty of Hawaii hit me most strongly
when I got home. The environment we live in is partly by necessity,
taken-for-granted, and also maybe because we (I) live so much in our heads,
that memory is more affecting than the things itself. David Abram's in his
book, The Spell of the Sensuous, talks very articulately and beautifully
about the co-extensiveness of our cognitive apparatus with the world around
us, a reciprocity developed over 2 million years.

The trip was followed by an extremely cold and wet period here in northern
california, in which numerous plants died in my garden, alas. The Creek was
flowing amply. As I walked by it on one of my first days back, I felt again
that little frisson I get from knowing as I cross over the creek to walk
along it on the Palo Alto side that I am crossing out of Menlo Park over a
county line, and that this creek is passionately discussed every day in the
local papers, including the SF Chronicle and San Jose Mercury.  And for me,
I realized that the mystery and attraction of the place also has to do with
this quality of being a boundary. (for more on this see my web site and the
essay "The Home Page as Literary Form", which looks at questions of boundary
in relation to identity and some of my other reference points and
connections to this. ) That I am most comfortble at the boundaries of
things, sometimes blurring them, often just hovering, fluid, where one thing
transforms into another. Sometimes these are borders, edges margins, just as
often they are flash-points for creativity. "The image which seems to me to
best represent the work of a writer at the point of his  highest commitment
is that of a threshold. The true writer moves continuously back and forth
(trans-gressing), across one or the other thresholds that separate the
different languages or cultures or mentalities or states of consciousness."
[Paolo Valesio "Writer Between Two Worlds" in Differentia: Review of Italian
Thought Number 3-4, Spring-Autumn 1989.]

Anyway, the landscape of the Peninsula has been for me a way of
re-discovering an existing and very fundamental structure in my persona and
my writing.  Thanks for a place in which to think this out.

I'm hesitant to go on for too long about new music here, but Stephen Cope wrote:

That'd be Isabelle, a suite "about" Isabelle Eberhardt, a European woman
who travelled around North Africa often dressed as a man.

The disc actually isn't on Tzadik, but Avant, Zorn's Japanese label
offering similar material (though not broken up into series like "Radical
Jewish Culture" etc.)  As a Japanese import it'll probably be harder to
find and expensive (US$20-25)

This disc also includes a nice series of duets with percussionist Ikue Mori
inspired by women super heroes from comic books of the 1940s & '50s.

I suppose I'll add to what seems to be really a new kind of genre, the
reading witness reportage, which, if this list did not invent, surely it
gave it sustenance.

Upenn has perhaps one of the few and well-funded "middle-spaces" left in
the world, a space which is half in the academy and half-run with
pragmatic anarchy by the undergraduates and surrounding community.  This
place, the Writers House, finds itself in relative autonomy to the cuts
and jabs of both the business (we need not make profit) and the academic
institution (the decisions of what to program and which writers to bring
always, so far, remain in the hands and help of undergrad students).  The
House here takes its own heat from the students who both run and think of
the house, but so far that has lead to further understanding rather than
further neglect.

So, amid this space these past few days were the wonderful writers Lee
Ann Brown (great smile, a less noticeable accent in person than on the
phone, will sing you out of what you thought you heard, and deeply
thoughtful), Jennifer Moxley (the grace and attack of a writer who always
has more to say, who asks considerately about the names and ideas of the
people she meets, and asks the right questions then and before, in
writing and in person), and with much welcome, Steve Evans (who has the
energy of many poets, the theoretical acuity to engage the hours into
options, and the friendliness to think this through with you).

They arrive Thurs. afternoon, and I help unload them in the guest suite,
with short orientations over brief beers.  Then a reading, with a room
filled more than usual, but less than we should want or need.  I give a
scattered intro of clips of email conversations from students.  Lee Ann
reads first, all pieces I think from her excellent and
back-and-forthcoming *Polyverse* (which we need in print Sun & Moon!).
This book looks to be a stunning collection of what Lee Ann has collected
up to recent, with substitute pledge of alliegences, thangs, oddly
familiar songs, fellowed collaborations, catchy daily observations, and
great short verse pieces.  This is quite a book and quite wonderful to
hear from.

Jennifer Moxley then reads, and varies from her wonderful newest
*Imagination Verses* to even more recent work.  The book is brilliant and
needs more than immediate encounters as perhaps finally a way of knowing
there is great poetry even according to the young.  And the newer work
is, maybe, even better, which just means you'll need to hear more of this
yourself.

After the reading a few writers and visitors make way to a local Japanese
dinner.  The Sake is melted and we drink but I linger back with a
headache from skipping breakfast and lunch.  Finally now I get to ask
Steve about that legendary panel this past summer in Orono on race and
O'hara, and what he says is right, that given the politics of O'hara's
time one has to read into O'hara's work the politics of dealing with that
time, which O'hara does, and so does Steve.  More food.  Lee Ann wields
her tape recorder and goes roundtable asking with good humor for oral
documentary of everyone's experience of first orgasm.  More food.

Some reconvene at poet's accomodations.  Major Jackson, there at the
reading and dinner and on tape, says goodbye.  I stay about and we talk
on and about, with late tea and cookies (for what poets do is eat).  Next
day is again filled with talking and ideas.  The writers all visit a
seminar carried inside the House.  Jennifer hopes there are spaces to be
made where poetry doesn't have to be immediately defensive always
explaining itself.  Steve argues well with intensity with Al Filreis
about the remains of poetic spaces.  Lee Ann speaks more about her way of
writing, and the making of forms for poetry, which anyone can read and
write with.  Then, downstairs with a ready audience, both poets read from
talks and essays.  Jennifer has a piece still going on "poetic labor" which
we can read soon from a next great wave of Impercipients, these ones a flight
of essays.  Lee Ann reads some on "ballad notes" and induces smiles with the
old drinking song which Francis Scott Key shifted into an anthem, then
later we sing group-wise a piece from Helen Adam.

Dinner is ready then, assortments of kugel, one batch by me.  More food
and more talking.  Jennifer says a bit about prose, a bit about memoirs.
Louis Cabri imagines more with the layout of a baroque reprise.  The
writers ask Louis about more from his journal *Hole* and what more from
Canada and Louis says there will be more.  We shift to couches.  Steve
talks further about what scenes seem as, now and before.  I hear more
from Jennifer about her translations and relations with Jacqueline
Risset.  Lee Ann talks some about her press.  Lee Ann falls barely into
sleep, wakes some and combs the cat, who responds curiously to her
pocketbook and scratches at the money inside.  Lee Ann grabs her recorder
in time to tape our witnesses of near death moments.  Steve remembers a
time in school when Bill Luoma came in to a reading swearing he just saw
death on a bus.  Time passes late so we crash our separate ways to sleep.

Next day just early stuff, brunch with the poets.  Bob Perelman is there
and we talk of magazines and groupings and workshopping poetry back when
Bob studied at Iowa, then now when he taught at Iowa.  Shawn Walker
begins a house meeting with input help from the writers on future writers
to bring.  Soon the writers have to get back and gather their stuff,
needing to leave on time for sandwiches and family.  The visit was a
wonderful time, and it's late now, so here is another log in the
furthering genre of reading accountings.

Small Press Traffic presents

Susan Howe

Saturday, February 8, 7:30 p.m.
New College Cultural Center
766 Valencia Street, SF

The last time Susan Howe read for Small Press Traffic was three years ago,
and mobs of people jammed the tiny space of Canessa Park--thrilled,
delighted, awed.  Simply put, Howe is one of the greatest readers we=B9ve
ever heard, AND WE=B9VE HEARD THEM ALL--as well as a great poet, thinker and
archaeologist of =B3marginalia.=B2

Howe is a Professor of English at the State University of New York,
Buffalo. She is the author of My Emily Dickinson, The Europe of Trusts,
Singularities, The Birth-Mark: Unsettling the Wilderness in American
Literary History_, and _The Nonconformist's Memorial. Her latest book is
_Frame Structures: Early Poems 1974-1979_ (Sun & Moon). Geoffrey O=B9Brien
has written, that Howe=B9s work is =B3a voyage of reconnaissance in=
 language, a
sounding out of ancient hiding places, and it is a voyage full of risk.
'Words are the only clues we have,' she has said. 'What if they fail us?'"

the rather recent, lovely film BANDIT QUEEN comes to mind as one to
consider -- not all too sure abt. female perspective in that per se,
would need to see it again -- also, as for epic? hmmm, certainly an
action film w/ some epic dimension (not to mention killer music) --

the film, as you perhaps know, is based on the real-life tale
of Phoolan Devi, who became a popular Bonnie w/o Clyde sorta
bandit-heroine in local mythology of 1980s Maharashtra, India (before
she was captured & jailed, as depicted in the film).  Her violent
& sexual mistreatment in early life -- and her "heroic struggle"
against both gender and caste strictures -- to become (as noted) a
kind of queen of the bandits -- are all integral to the tale --

Yeah, i should have thought of that. I think she has just been arrested for
something.  Although i am glad films like that are made i don't know that i
would call it 'lovely'. It's interestingly problematic though, euro
audiences seemed to lap it up, while Indian audiences (well middleage & up)
were not able to cope with the graphic sex of it, so i think it failed to
reach a sector of it's potential audience that could have benefited from
discussion of it - that's in this country anyway. I couldn't speak for
anywhere else ( can't actually speak for anything outside my personal contacts)

anyway,

Ah, thats better. just cleared my computer of shrum virush oopsh. . . lets
try again. yeah, thats fixed it.

the reason i'm feeling so good, good and silly, is that the group i'm with,
who have brought a lawsuit to make the city council appear in court to
defend their approval of an absurdly inadequate set of mitigation measures
in an enivronmental impact report concerning the annexation of an apple
orchard so that a man named o'reilly can turn it into a 16-acre business
park (there are adequate business parks just 4 miles down the road
already), held a fundraiser from 4-7 this sunday p.m., and this event was
better attended than i'd feared it wd be. we also held a silent auction and
my friend and collaborator mark perlman gave us a print for which someone
pd $150 (it's worth $1100, but what can you do), so we probably raised net
abt $1500, which means we now have abt 50% of the $18 grand we need to pay
our attorney by the end of the month . . . hope dies last.

I like living in a town small enough (or it has been) that small groups can
make a difference politically. today's m.c., Buzzy Martin, musician and
curator of music at jasper o'farrell's bar, ran for city council last fall
and without campaigning at all (his sole lawnsign was on my lawn, and i say
'my' because my wife supported another candidate and put her lawnsign on
'her' lawn) polled over 800 votes, and it only takes 1500 to get a seat. we
hope (, , ,dies last) his increasing visibility will get him elected 2
years from now. he's needed there because pro-development forces rule since
november, including a mayor, Sam Crump (Mister crump dont 'low no
barrelhousin here), who had the gall to observe re-the o'reilly (whom some
of us refer to as Oh, really?) project was probably unpopular with more
than half the electorate, but "what kind of message would that send to
developers?" Gee, Sam, stay away, I'd say . . . Since retiring, i seldom
appear in public so am now tired but wired and roaming the virtual streets
looking for wedding guests. I dont t h i n k  there was a target in my epic

A marinated town is by definition more an exburb than a shruburb. Down here
in San Diego, where the powers that think to be are trying to convince the
voters to bribe the football team to stay by spending 78 million on a
stadium expansion _and_ promising to buy all the seats needed at each game
to make it come out to 60,000 (I suppose they could give the empty seats to
welfare mothers), there aint much left to save, but the developers talk
about the american way while fighting over the poor scraps like a bunch of
hungry dogs. Not my best sentence, but you get my drift. And the very rich,
as if to demonstrate that they didn't have to be real smart to get that way,
build their houses on the edge of cliffs with no bedrock support, no
vegetation to hold them together, and the surf pounding at the bottom--and
they really do seem surprised when the place falls in. Sometimes the city
helps things along by undercutting the cliff with a new road, thereby
killing two birds with one stone--you get a mudslide _and_ stop the traffic.
Actually, shruburb was my attempt to remind the list that there are suburbs,
and then there are nasty suburbs where all of the bad stuff that cities tend
not to want visible get zoned out to--refineries, rust-belt workshops, all
that stuff, and a lot of lost kids with no prospects and bored to tears. But
I couldn't think of a good name for that kind of place--gruburbs? Doesn't
exactly roll off the tongue.

Sad news from Maine. Mitchell Goodman died Saturday at his home in Temple,
Maine, of pancreatic cancer. Poet, novelist, anti-war activist all his
life. He was 73, and when I saw him last, at the Poets of the 1950s
conference in Orono in June, he was full of life. We exchanged books & had
a good talk. Here's a poem from his book More Light: Selected Poems (Dog
Ear Press 1989).

this was a terrific review josh, of writers who (for once) i know something
about and it's so nice to read of them thru you/the list. a year ago i knew lee
ann but not steve and jennifer; steve i met thru his indeed tour de force o'hara
paper and then i met jennifer but just a week ago received imagination verses in
the mail from spd. what a treat.  also having met you and shawn and al f at the
writers' house last yr i had a warm memory...sorry to get so sentimental all,
but january is over and that is a moment of great feeling and rejoicing in
minnesota.  the sun is out for dramatically longer each successive week, and

I'm with Stephen Cope on Spicer.  _After Lorca_ would be a great,
complex object to bring to the class because its next to impossible to
pin down. the pretence of spirit possession/communication is
elaborate but also at various points punched through with humor,
openly denied, even mocked, & then perpetuated anyway.

just to continue on this thread, i have some discomfort with the wording of your
sentiments, which i take overall as expressing the kinds of concerns i brought
up in my last post --namely, "indian audiences were not able to cope w/ the
graphic sex of it, so i think it failed to reach a sector of its potential
audience that could have benefited from a discussion of it..."
it sounds kinda, a little, like,...patronizing, as if indian audiences fell down
on their job of spectator and thus the movie failed to "enlighten" those who
"most needed it" or some such. the "civilizing mission" foiled thru the
backwardness of the Other. etc. this post isnt hostilely or "policingly"
intended. just sharing my impressions.

Dan,

you might try Dreyer's "Passion of Joan of Arc" or Bresson's "Trial of Joan
of Arc," though the latter may be unavailable on video. Jacques Rivette has
a 1994/95 film on Joan called "Jehanne la Pucelle," but it's yet to be
released in the States.

this film has been the subject of much controversy, including an attempt on
phoolan devi's part to suppress it, as it does her sense of her own story a
disservice.  if i were going to teach this film, i'd familiarize myself w/ this
controversy so i'd have some sense of whether or not i was violating the
subject's wishes.  one of my students who is working on hindi film, gender, and
censorship followed this pretty closely, and ended up wishing that she had not
seen the movie, which, even before the controversy,, she found voyeuristic and
sensationalistic.  having not seen it myself i can't comment, but thought it
important to pass on word of its controversy.  -md

From a performance angle as well as textual:
Try Maya Deren's films and writings. And L.A. performance artist Rachel
Rosenthal.

Also do some research into how artist Matt Mullican came up with his world
of signs (he WENT there, hypnotised in performance).  His accounts of
how he got to that stage are a wonderful performanec too; my favorite part
was when he looked at three drawings of stick figures, one on a blank
page, one (I think) standing on a line, and one in a corner (3 lines
behind); and he asked himself, "which stick figure can feel pain most?"
The answer, to everyone present as well as to him, was the one in the
corner.  Dimensionality.

And Nathaniel Mackey re possession/performance in Bedouin Hornbook etc.

I'd always thought "exurb" better applied to those hollowed out areas at
the center of most major cities where all that we value in the urban used
to take place, but whose place will next be taken by identical sports
palaces and shopping malls once the speculators get the prices down and
the tax breaks up --

AND

re: reviews of readings as genre:

for several years I have asked students to write reviews of poetry
readings -- the "student-authored" "reading review" appears to have a
generic introduction:

"When my professor assigned a poetry reading I didn't expect to enjoy the
experience, but much to my surprise poet X captivated me."

At first I thought this simply a transparent effort to captivate the
professor's higher grade range -- but it occurs so often that I now think
it a measure of just what the students' prior educational experiences
have taught them to expect of poetry and poets -- The non-English majors
among my students are uniformly surprised to find that they enjoy
listening to poetry --

will probably not make it to see all my San Francisco friends at Small
Press Traffic this weekend, but will catch Howe's South Bay reading at
Stanford -- maybe we can compare notes here afterward --

About the copy of In the American Tree that was never checked out:  a VERY
LARGE number of titles are acquired by research libraries (and to a lesser
extent this is true of public libraries as well) that never get checked
out.  Strange but true.  Of course this indicates that there should be a
lot more work done on resource sharing, coordinated collection
development, inter-library loan, etc. etc.  And under the current economic
pressures these things are indeed speeding up...(I've been involved with
them over the years at a number of libraries).  But believe me, research
in the library literature shows that such a fate for any given title in a
given library, is not statistically unusual.  It was not by any means a
unique event caused by the unpopularity of non-mainstream poetry!

Despite the fact that I have made reference in print to the fact of a
text's never having been checked out of the UCLA library -- none of us
should equate that with the book's not having been read -- PARTICULARLY
in research libraries people often use books without removing them FROM
the library.  This is a practice in my own work -- I'm one of those
annoying people who disregard the signs posted by the librarians and
reshelve books myself (BUT I DO make sure to shelve them correctly!) --

The one exception --  from time to time our library keeps records of the
usage rates of journals they are considering for elimination -- In those
instances I not only leave the journal on the reshelving shelf so that my
use of it may be tabulated, I go get it several more times so it will be
counted again and again --

i don;'t think i actually laughed at you.  i just didn't quite know what to make
of you.  it ws at mla 2 yrs ago, at the panel on poetries of the isles of
california, where ed dorn railed against the "bootlicking fascists of
multiculturalism" and i had to get up after that, the unknown and only chick on
the panel, and talk about jessica hagedorn, ntozake shange, and the bay area as
multicultural heaven.  afterward someone (mdavidson?) introduced us. it was
myfirst experience w/ the "poetry division" and w/ many of the folks i now know
thru poetix list etc.

funny-but-true Freud) Artaud to that list. Eshelman's Translations in
Conductors of the Pit is the best I have seen. This subject is a bit like

Might also check out Mead and Bateson, "Art, Grace, and Style in Primitive
Art in Bali."  And there's a "modelling" study of French-Canadian actress
Viola Legere.  I can hunt it down if you're interested; it's a remarkable
act of attention. Backchannel, since I'll have to go back to lurk-mode

Dolores O'Riordan
When I once, on the television, saw her in some program on PBS which
featured Pavarotti, Bono and The Edge from U2, Michael Bolton, and a few
others, Dolores sang Ave Maria. One person listening thought at first that
it was Minnie Mouse -- but I think she's actually a very good singer,
although true that hers is a fairly thin voice.

Agreed. Woman's p.o.v. my kiester..  Though the last before that I walked
out on was a pseudo-hip Demme film.  Name escapes me for good reason.
Came close to walking out on The English Patient but my s.o. wanted to see
it out.

Yes, and I often sit on the floor in the stacks for hours after stumbling on
a trove of books I know nothing about, sometimes in fields I know nothing
about, because I found my way there in search of the one book that I may

beth,
what would an 'indian film' be?
isn't all film 'voyeuristic'? all'seeing'?
interestingly,  'voyeurism' implies 'seeing' that's directed _in_ from
the _out_ side, which warps (perverse: 'to turn about').
best, dan featherston

let me just add to Mark's post that an item which is not checked out
of the library is not necessarily going unused. I spend a good deal
of my time (probably too much) reading, strange as it may seem,
right here on the premises--& that includes poetry.  in fact, in
light of this discussion, I'm thinking maybe I should check the
buggery things out after all, just to boost their circ statistics.
hell, maybe I'll check them all out, over & over--I could develop a
rotating, year-long schedule, maybe even organize this as a group
activity.  see, there is something to be learned from the folks at Dianetics.

It's true, Paul wrote on all those topics (like self-refuting onanism).
I'll try to type the poem, but I'm not sure I can control the spacing,
Chris. It's on page 316 of Blackburn's Collected Poems, or send your
address & I'll send a copy. Come to think of it, I must have your address
somewhere.

Praise to you,  Sylvester,  for actually typing in a Blackburn poem!
And, yes, it seems that you got the spacing right.  It never ceases to
amaze me how Blackburn's open form immediately captures MY breath and
spirit,  catches me up in its vitality and freshness of articulation.
Isn't this what Blackburn finally mastered--a vitality of
articulation?  And in doing so,  a unique and individualized
presentation of truth.  Long live Blackburn the Word!

This afternoon a man called Small Press Traffic and said, "It says here
that you're having Suzy Howe reading at New College.  Is that Susan Howe?"
And when I told him that is was indeed Susan Howe, he said that it said
Suzy Howe in the paper.  He added, "This is *terrible*."

I wish I had asked him which paper it was in!

doctors..." etc.

        Julie: a very few suggestions:

        1. *Untold Sisters, Hispanic Nuns in their Own Words,* Electa
Arenal & Stacey Schlau, U. of New Mexico Press, 1989. Full of remarkable
documents.I cite just a very few representative quotes. For example,
citations from the Venerable Madre Isabel de Jesus (1586-1648):

  "While I was looking at a carved figure of the Most Holy Christ, He
beckoned me with His holy head, and looking at me with His eyes, He pointed
to the wound in his Most Sacred Rib: He ordered me to enter Him through it,
He performed this gesture of love with me, by means of His own portrait."

 Arenal/Schlau: "Jesus appears as mother; Isabel sees Him nursing dogs from
his engorged breasts.... Madre Isabel explains that Christ's milk-filled
breasts are his mercy, but their engorgement (his pain)  is a result of his
children's refusal to accept his divine word; this refusal is their
illness...  [Isabel's vision makes] inextricable connections between
herself and Jesus through the imagery of his milk of mercy and
body-blood..."

        2, *Lame Deer, Seeker of Visions*, John Lame Deer and Richard
Erdoes, NY:Touchstone, Simon & Shuster, 1972. For instance, from the
Chapter on "Looking at the Sun, they Dance.":

"Staring open-eyed at the blazing sun, the blinding rays burning deep into
your skull, filling it with unbearable brightness...Many people do not un
derstand why we do this. They call the sun dance barbarous, savage, a
bloody supersitition. The way I look at it our body is the only thing which
truly belongs to us. When we Indians give of our flesh, our bodies, we are
giving of the only thing which is ours alone....It is [at acute
moments]that the visions occur--visions of becoming a medicine man, visions
of the future.... Insights gained at such a price are even greater than
those that come to a man on a hilltop during his vision quest; they are
truly wakan--sacred."

        3. *The Shaman Aningatchaq* by Tom Lowenstein, Shaman's narration
presented in transliteration and translation and commented on by Lowenstein
from Tikiraq, Alaska.London: Many Press, 1981 (address: 15 Norcott Rd,
London N.16) :

A shaman's anecdote: "In the early days, shamans living on the west side of
the village used to visit (in spirit flight) the people who lived on the
east side. Once one was travelling in a ball of fire: and when someone
strujck a whale's jaw bone, the shaman fell. It was forbidden to touch a
whale's jaw wlhile a shaman was flying."


And another: "And once Tigautchialuk (another shaman) was doing "ulimaq" (a
practice in which the shaman turns his clothes inside out before flying).
He left Tikiraq; he flew off, and when he was near the cliffs, he met
someone coming from the south. And the shaman flying from the south made
Tigautchialuk's spirit fall to earth. His "inuusiq" (life force) failed,
and he died. I don't know where Tigautchialu, was heading. Ulimmaq was
something the shamans used to do before spirit flight."

        4. *KA PO'E KAHIKO, The People of Old* by Samuel Kamakau,
Honolulu:Bishop Museum Press 1964.

"Noha Ana--Medium Possession: Spirits often return and speak through a
"maluna," a person who is inspired because he has become possessed "Ma ka
uluhia ana mai a noho iluna." Some possessed persons speak crazily. Some
speak as inspired prophets "uluhia kaula" or prophesiers "uluhia wanana",
some just talk, and some give inspired help. There are many kinds of
spirits that help for good and many that aid in evil. Some lie and deceive,
and some are truthful; it would not be possible  for a man to do these
things without the aid of his possessing spirit." [Originally published in
Hawaii in 1871.]

Visions and Dreams: Dreams are of two kinds: dreams at the moment of
falling asleep "hihi'o"; and dreams in deep sleep "moe 'uhane." A vision,
"akaku," is unlike either of these. It is what one sees when one is really
awake..."

        5.*Le Vodou Haitien* by Louis Maximilien, Port-au-Prince,
Haiti:Imprimerie de L'Etat, 1945. "La crise de Loa se developpe sous
l'influence de l'idee d'une possession d'un etre humain, par l'esprit d'un
dieu." With photos, sketches, presentation of priestly function in detail,
ceremonies, rites and the language of rites.

        6. *Tales of the Hasidim, the Early Masters* Martin Buber,
NY:Shocken 1947.

                               The Coat

"Whatever the rabbi of Koznits said sounded as if he were praying, only
weaker and in a lower voice. He liked to hum to himself proverbs and
sayings current among the Polish peasants. After a Purim feast, which he
had presided over in great happiness, he said: 'How right, what the people
say: Take off your coat, dear soul, and prance with joy at feast and
dance.' But how curious a coat is the body!' Sometimes he even spoke to God
in Polish. When he was alone they would hear him say: 'Moj kochanku,' which
means 'My darling.' "

        *Breakthrough: Meister Eckhart's Creation Spirituality in New
Translation*, by Matthew Fox, with commentaries.Garden City: Image Books,
Doubleday, 1980. A big anthology of the Christian mystic whose writings are
suggestive of Zen experience and writings.

"You should love God mindlessly, that is, so that your soul is without mind
and free from all mental activities, for as long as your soul is operating
like a mind, so long does it have images and representations. But as long
as it has images, it has intermediaries, and as long as it has
intermediaries, it has neither oneness nor simplicity. And therefore your
soul should be bare of all mind and should stay there without mind."

Dear Aldon: Thank you for sending me THREE copies of LLS, your beautiful
magazine available in fine bookstores everywhere...
aside from the mention of your book and the very funny satirical (collage)
piece by Steve Tills and the visuals by Spencer Slby and Jacques Debrot,
there was also Mary "interrupted puppet" Winters who has a great piece called
"What I like Best About A Relationship is its Potential FOr Narrative" and
the lost glacier. Loss Glazier has a line about the "TExt's ability to DOPE
the given situation" and there are some bittersweet 'nostalgic' type poems
too--
Richard Flynn "Feeling and form/(a yesterday I/ find almost impossible"!!!!!
and qeoffrey jacques' "California"--
"nothing's sweeter or lovelier/ than the acquantaince I'm pleased to
make/alongside this tinkling/tinker toy/if only i knew what hearts meant as
we sit staring over coffee/talking about sublime occupations/.---etc. or as
Michael Bassinski says (on a similar topic): "the mouth of the heart is/not
near the heart/ who is"------

The only thing I hate about the issue are those terrible poems "Society's
Child" and "Things People Say While Dancing"---
I can't believe you'd publish such dribble, but I'll forgive you.

maria, it's beginning to filter back to me . . . twilite zone soundtrack,
please . . .but i (I) wasnt on the calif panel, i was on alan golding's
brit poetry panel talking abt allan fisher. its funny that mdavidson made
this introduction thats elusive to my memory, because he has always
maintained that he first met me "coming round a corner" of my house in the
country, but i didnt move to the country till 1970, and met md first at his
apt in bkly in 68 or 69. but i know this matter of mixing up a striking
impression of a person with meeting him for the first time: i "first met" g
bowering coming around the corner of brock hall (in whose basement the
campus-newspaper staff held chain-smoking contests), and surely that
meeting did take place, because i remember him that moment,against that
backdrop, pale and shaking and somewhat surly, but he told me once that we
met first in creative writing class, playing footsies with the same third
party.
the first time i met anselm hollo (having corresponded with him slightly a
decade before) was when he was visiting san fran, and staying with bob and
francie (perelman and shaw). i then lived in sAn fran and bob came by to
take me over to meet anselm. i was a little bit the better for wear and
began to obsess as bob drove and spoke, that i wd say something dumb when i
at last met the great finn. I decided I'd say, "I've wanted to meet you for
a long time!" Up the stairs and into the kitchen and there sat hollo, the
sunlight falling directly onto his eyes, which were an incredible blue and
with almost no pupils, like a cat's. struck by this sight, i cd only
stammer "Anselm, it's been a long time!" Anselm, not missing a beat,
replied "Eternity." db

Sign of the Times (one of a series). One doesn't have to be an
advocate of the Great Books approach to literature to be
saddened by this. I know the building well; it's within
walking distance of where we live. You need only imagine the
likelihood of such a fate befalling the house of, say, Morike,
to realize what we Anglo-Saxons are allowing to happen to our
literary heritage. Ezra Pound's birthplace in Hayley, Idaho,
is also falling to bits. At least it has a peeling wooden
plaque on the wall, but the town's little publicity hand-out
doesn't even mention him.

It will ultimately depend on the enthusiasm of one of those
World Cultures which we now so warmly embrace. Perhaps the
Japanese will endow Keats' house before it becomes a pile of
rubble.

The [London] Guardian  February 4 1997

ODE TO RACK AND RUIN

Sebastian Faulks

KEAT'S HOUSE is falling down.  It is the most perfect memorial
to any English writer - exactly preserved, full of important
papers, open to the public, delightful to visit, charged with
atmosphere - and it is coming apart.  The beautiful Regency
cottage is in Hampstead, north London, and was built by
Keats's friends Charles Brown and Charles Dilke in 1815-16.
Part of the problem is that the house is built on clay and
seldom stays still; the curator, Christina Gee, says that an
entire wing has parted from the main house and many of the
supporting walls are easing away from the chimney flues.
Plaster has fallen from the ceilings and the chimneys are
wrapped in Polythene; the collection of manuscripts and books
is threatened by water and the walls of Keats's bedroom are
stained by damp.

Andrew Motion, the writer who has just finished a biography of
Keats, used to watch water run down inside the walls while he
was researching in the library.  As a matter of fact the house
was always prone to leak.  Brown and Dilke did not spend much
on the construction of the building and Keats's biographer W J
Bate records that even in Keats's day the basement kitchen and
dining room were damp for much of the year.  Although houses
in the street are now very expensive, 1815 Hampstead was in
the countryside and the house, though pretty, was small.  For
full board Keats paid L5 a month.

He moved in with Brown in the winter of 1818.  After years of
intense apprenticeship, of many trials and many errors, Keats
was at last on the verge of something magnificent.  Bate's
restrained biography puts it like this: "The year ... from
about mid-September 1818 ... may be soberly described as the
most productive in the life of any poet of the past three
centuries."

I used to visit this wonderful museum frequently in the
seventies, partly because I loved Keats's poetry but also
because I was fascinated by Charles Brown.  What must it have
been like to live with a genius during his most productive
period - a period, as Bate reminds us, almost unmatched in
literary history?

Brown was in his early thirties, a former merchant with an
inherited income of about L300 a year, which was enough to
lead a life of literary leisure.  He was of a type not much
seen today: a businessman whose passion was for admiring and
encouraging the creative gifts of others.  What everyone said
about Brown was that he was practical and "down to earth".
Mind you, so, in many ways, was Keats.  Small, voluble,
pugnacious, he had impressed his teachers with a belief that
he would achieve something in the world, but probably "in some
military capacity".

Did he talk to Brown at dinner about his poetry?  Perhaps he
talked about Fanny Brawne, whose mother had taken Brown's half
of the house the previous summer.  She was a sharp-featured
girl of 18 whom Keats initially thought "ignorant", minx-like
and lacking modesty, but in the summer of 1819 she began to
receive his sumptuous love letters.  And what can she have
made of them?

After one of his characteristic periods of recapitulation in
early 1819, Keats cleared his mind.  The planets moved into a
favourable conjunction and he began to write again: first the
Ode To Psyche; then one May morning he went and sat beneath
the plum tree at the front of the house and wrote the entire
80-line Ode To A Nightingale.

When Keats came in at lunch time Brown noticed that he had
some pieces of paper in his hand.  They had a maid at that
time who was a keen tidier and throweraway, and Brown saw that
Keats stuffed the pieces of paper down behind some books: he
had thought them worth saving.  When Keats went up to his
room, did Brown go to the bookshelf, pull out the scraps of
paper and read them?

A few days later Keats wrote Ode On A Grecian Urn.  He
followed this with the Ode On Melancholy.  Although the Ode To
Autumn would not come until later in the year, he had, as Bate
puts it, "within about three weeks written four of the
greatest lyric poems in English".

And now the house is falling down.  The curator of the museum
says that 60 per cent of her visitors are from abroad; British
schoolchildren rarely visit these days because Keats is no
longer on their syllabus.  They do not have to study pre20th
century writers at all, and if they do, then, according to
Christine Cayley of the Cambridge Examination Board, "Many
British children choose an author such as Jane Austen, with
popular video versions available." As Andrew Motion puts it:
"If children are not studying these poems then something has
gone drastically wrong."

Keats's reputation has suffered a kind of literary subsidence,
partly caused by the fact that today's children are protected
from exposure to anything old or, God forbid, "difficult".
Motion hopes vigorously to reinvent Keats for today's reader
and thinks it more likely that this can be done through
biography than by merely hoping that the texts will be read
again.  Even a decade ago the idea that such drastic critical
repair work might soon be necessary would have seemed to
belong to some illiterate nightmare.

The house meanwhile has just become a charitable trust and has
passed from the care of Camden council's leisure services to
that of the City of London.  Christina Gee is hopeful that the
corporation will do all that is needed - though the relevant
department, alas, has just been asked to make cuts of L3.8
million.

Within a few months of his astonishing summer Keats was dead
of TB in Rome at the age of 26.  This self-taught son of a
stable keeper had driven himself to compose four of the
greatest lyric poems in English - but he had no video tie-ins.

The important thing is that the City of London does its duty,
but donations are welcome at Keats House, Keats Grove, London,
NW3 2RR (telephone: 0171-794 6829).

Wow, a whole lotta walkin out goin on. I don't think I've ever walked
out on a movie. I guess I'm an unreconstructed voyeur. I can't stop
looking. I loved the English Patient. Did anybody notice how Olson's
Special View of History got worked into the Herodotus business?
That's Ondaatje for you. Bob Creeley once showed me a letter from
Michael Ondaatje in which he talked about rewriting In the Skin of a
Lion 4 or 5 times in order to work into it certain important points
from the Olson/Creeley correspondence.

The Globe and Mail, Canada's right wing business rag, has recently
tried to stir up an attack on the English Patient by comparing it
unfavourably to--get this--Casablanca. They ran an essay by some
philosophy professor from Calgary who claimed that Casablanca was a
"moral" movie and TEP was an "immoral" movie based on their respective
orientations toward "self-sacrifice". When a number of very articulate
letters came in calling into question the rather simple minded sense
of "morality" being deployed, the Globe ran a 20 column inch editorial
trying to connect the English Patient to the Kim Philby spy scandal,
and claiming that it seriously undermined patriotic Candians' will to
go to war for their country. Should the need arise.

O those neo-cons. Ya gotta love em.

I tried replying to Maria's post, but it seems to have disappeared in
the void. (Useful if you're a Buddhist, but not so good for messages . . .

Anyway, Maria, I was confused by your epic/pubick connection, couldn't
quite make your point out (perhaps there was none?), but did think it
could work as a description of HD's wonderful poem, Helen in Egypt,
a classic post-Pound take on the epic.

Aldon,
I'm rather fond of Chet Baker's version of "There Will Never Be Another
You," sung in that achingly pure, hurting, tender, fundamentally YOUNG
voice, or at least that voice just at the moment of discovery and change.
His "My Funny Valentine" the same . . . And Sonny Rollins' album "Live
at the Five Spot" has a small part of Blackburn's poem on the liner
notes, if I remember rightly.

What with sampling and all, maybe we should talk about favorite versions
of works. I was a little surprised, to use a mundane example, that none of
my students had ever heard the Stevie Wonder original of the Coolio cover.
It seems to me that the concept of "plagiarism" is undergoing a sea change
these days, what with borrowings left and right; I remember a quote -- was
it Eliot? -- who said "mediocre poets imitate; the best steal outright."

         I have to confess, c., that I've been doing that for some time now:
checking out books and not reading them. I check out seven, read one, return
five, get heavilyfined on two, check out five, read two, return seven, begin
the cycle again. I consider it doing my part to assist in the up-keep of
such institutions: my method usually generates an average of $20 in fines
per book read. About the cost of the book did I buy it in a store.

        All this, too, might be learned from Dianetics.

        Oh yes. You will find a hill the shape of a woman. Her back.
Reclining. Nude as the sand. Occasionaly she will rise from bathtubs, etc.
With greater frequency than ever before I have found myself absolutely
disgusted while watching movies I thought would be stupid but entertaining.
        The E. P. for all its immaturity (what was a line? "the map of the
body, the map without boarders?) was at least nothing like the new line of,
as you say, pseudo-hip films a la Demme, Tarintino and whoever made that
"Seven."
        But I suppose this is a useless complaint...

        Form, IMO, especially generic form, may assist content (subject
matter) but it should not be used to excuse it, no matter how warping it is.
        Nor do I recall the above-discussed film using a particularly
self-referential or dialectical approach.

Although I didn't walk out on the Bandit Queen, I did find it to be a
classic example of limits of propaganda. The director, who was at the
screening where I saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, was so busy
trying to get his audience enraged at the abuses of the Indian ruling
classes, that he ended up pounding us over the head with images in
which "good" and "bad" were so sharply delineated I felt like I was
trapped in an old Bob Steele western where you always can tell who's
who by whether they wear white or black. Or maybe some Manichean comic
book. The so-called gratuitous sex was just part of that manipulative
mechanism, so evil that when Phoolan Devi goes back and guns down all
those guys who raped her, you're supposed to sit in the dark muttering
"right on", like when Sally Fields gets Keifer Sutherland at the end
of that terrible movie that came out last year (which I didn't walk
out on, either).

1. All groups, associations, and credentialled professionals in poetry
are the reader's adversaries and enemies, no matter what artistic

2. Poets themselves do not realize what poetry, and the reader, together

The rest is scholarship and "food for thought".  Poetry lives on the other
side of death.

3. Every poet who sacrifices heart and soul for the sake of poetry

literary professionals, as well as by the reader and by poetry itself.
Sacrifice is an illusion, mercy is sacrifice, poetry is against idolatry.

I didn't get to attend the big plagiarism conference of some years back,
and couldn't talk anybody at San Jose State into copying the idea --

Some years ago, though, I gave a paper at ALA titled "Citation, Use and
Sampling" which used examples from Perelman, Harryman and others to
comment on debates between Searle and Derrida about the topics listed in
my title -- Sent it to _Sagetrieb_, but their reader, who had never read
the Derrida essay cited & used, wanted revisions that I did not want --
so it's been here in my desk ever since -- I've thought I should make it
available as some kind of counter to Lehman's mean-spirited and inaccurate
account of the Harryman/Derrida lines in _Signs of the Times_ -- If I can
relocate the disk that essay is on, maybe I'll ask Loss if I can add it
to my pages at EPC --

Odd footnote -- Copy shops around the country have grown more paranoid
since the last court decision that should have made things easier
(perhaps an inverse response to the rampant illegalities of copyright
infringement the same shops once practiced), and now I am frequently told
that I cannot copy myself -- Three shops in the past year have refused to
make copies for my students of printed materials that I authored and
whose copyright I own --

Though I have on occasion received small checks because professors at
USC, where they will not interview me, have copied my works for their
classes  (I KNOW IT'S NOT THE SAME PEOPLE COPYING ME AND NOT INTERVIEWING
ME -- But how am I going to work up a good case of ressentiment if I let
details like that get in my way!)

and what about titles -- titles apparently cannot be copyrighted on their
own -- At least twelve people have appropriated "Reading Race" as a title
for a publication (let's not even start to count conference panels &
papers) -- So far Dana Nelson, bless her heart, is the only one who
acknowledged the origins of the title in her book -- Shoulda trademarked
the thing, like the coach who trademarked "threepeat" a few years ago --

If I ever have a collected poems I'm going to title it _Gone with the
Wind_ and hope for big sales --

This post, by the way, was adapted from a text by David Bromige, who
wrote _My Poetry_ -- I even copied his birthday -- I even own a pair of
red suspenders -- and Maria once laughed at me in San Diego -- I've grown
a beard and started wearing glasses, but I can't get that accent right --

as we said in grade school, accept no substitutes --

yours,
aldon -- or maybe somebody standing in his place --

>Guess Jeans is proceeding with its libel and slander lawsuit against several

>January 30.
>As the lawsuit moves forward, Common Threads, one of the organizations being

>Midnight Special. The event will take place on Sunday, February 2, at 2 pm.
>Among those reading will be Luis Campos, Alexis Krasilovsky, Julia Stein and
>Merrihelen Ponce. Edna Bonacich will give an update on the fight between
>Guess and UNITE. Midnight Special is located at 1318 Third St. Promenade in
>Santa Monica.
>The lawsuit was filed against UNITE, the Union of Needle trades Industrial
>and Textile Employees and Common Threads, a woman's group working to improve
>working conditions for garment workers. Also named in the lawsuit are David
>Young, national director for UNITE, fifty unidentified individuals ("Does 1
>through 50, inclusive") and fifty unidentified associations.
>Some of the charges in the lawsuit are based on a "Justice for Garment
>Workers" reading held at Midnight Special on Sept. 8, 1996. The reading was
>sponsored by the L.A. local of the National Writers Union, and Common
>Threads. At the reading, Enrique Flores, a former employee of Kelly
>Contractors, one of the contractors which sewed clothing for Guess, described
>his working conditions. Edna Bonacich, a professor of sociology at UC
>Riverside, described the Common Threads campaign against unfair working
>conditions at Guess. Other writers, including Julia Stein and Carol
>Schwalberg, read writings about garment workers, none of which mentioned
>Guess specifically. Only David Young and Edna Bonacich have been served with
>papers.
>The lawsuit is based on the claim that "false and defamatory" statements were
>made about Guess during the reading and in publicity for it. The specific
>statements objected to were that Guess uses sweatshops and home labor in
>southern California to produce its clothing. Guess denies these allegations.
>The defendants have characterized the lawsuit as a S.L.A.P.P. (Strategic
>lawsuit against public participation) suit, a form of legal harassment used
>to silence critics. California has an anti-S.L.A.P.P. statute. UNITE and
>Common Threads have asked that the lawsuit be thrown out under the
>anit-S.L.A.P.P. statute. No ruling has yet been issued on this.
>Recent developments involving Guess throw light, direct and indirect, on the
>lawsuit. One firm tenet of Guess' defense is that appeared on the U.S. Dept.
>of Labor's "Trendsetter" list of clothing manufacturers actively improving
>the working conditions of their employees. However, on Nov. 27, 1996, the DOL
>removed Guess from the Trendsetters list, following a DOL investigation which
>found Guess had used contractors which violated minimum wage and overtime
>regulations.
>Recently, Guess announced, perhaps coincidentally, that it is moving more

I have a list of every book I have read since I was 14. After I have read
10 books by someone, I make up a little list for his/her name and staple it
to the cover of the notebook I keep my main list in. I always thought I
must be the only person tight-assed enough to do this.

I even list Bromige's books!

Comments: To: POETICS@LISTSERV.ACSU

There is a rapidly growing amount of worthwhile literature concerning
that spirit worker amoung spirit worker--the shaman (or to use Eliade's
term "the technician of ecstasy")--and performance/poetics.  A good place
to start might be Andreas Lommel's Shamanism: The Beginnings of Art
(1967) and J. Rothenberg's Technicians of the Sacred (esp. his Pre-Faces,
both 1967 & 1984 eds.).  As P. Joris has already pointed out, the Mazatec
shaman Maria Sabina is certainly an interesting case study. Robert
Gordon Wasson's Maria Sabina and her Mushroom Velada and the Folkways
Records recording of one of her 1956 curing ceremonies (Mushroom Ceremony
of the Mazatec Indians of Mexico) are both exceptional documents.

Also worthwhile: Joan Halifax has produced an interesting compilation of
shamanic narratives called Shamanic Voices and Mark Levy has produced an
excellent study of shamanic influences in modern art (Technicians of
Ecstasy, 1993) that includes an engaging take on contemporary performance
artists such as Karen Finley and Rachel Rosenthal. (I would also humbly
suggest a much neglected source, my M.A. thesis--The Shaman's Voice: Anne
Waldman and Marina Sabina(University of Texas at Dallas 1992)--which deals
with Waldman's conscious use of shamanic themes and techniques, including
substantial borrowing from Sabina.)

I could go on...I'm very much intrigued with the idea that the poetic act
often, if not always, consists of a type of opening up to an exotic
Other (whatever that may consist of--spirits, mythology, chance
associations, natural phenomena,etc.) and that a poetic tradition, whither
it be Bantu, Mazatec or that massively unstable ritual we share called
contemporary American poetics, gives the poet the tools to bring it back
alive.

Can anyone help me?  I have this print out from RLIN that tells me where
all the Spicer manuscripts are lodged throughout the country in what
different university libraries, etc....  however, they use a code I find

Pierre, tell your friend there's an organization in Hailey, Idaho called
The Ezra Pound Association, trying to raise money to buy the Pound house.
In October, the town celebrated "Ezra Pound Week,' with a play, lectures,
slide shows of Italy, performance readings, etc. He can get details about
the organization on the National Poetry Foundation Bulletin Board at

who wonders if we maria & I will ever get time to work on our hypertext
collaboration again

and here's me, having taught a class here last night and lost my composure cuz i
hate teaching in front of friends (miekal) i babbled about lenny bruce, blaser's
cups, and ginsberg.  we listened to bruce tapes, the younger ones were shocked
("did he perform this to a mixed audience?  or an allwhite, behind-closed-doors
kind of thing?")  anyway today is the reading day, miekal and i will go to my
office and work on our hypertext, then at 3:15 is the reading in the dark
ING-GLITCH department of the soul.  send good vibes at 3:15 cetral standard
time.  last nite miekal told the class about bern porter and passed books
around.  it was cool, the highlight of the evening.  epik/pupik not heavy, just

I took my son up to Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin for a swim meet a few
weeks back. Had dinner at
Club 26, a fine supper club there. On the wall, in frame, amidst a
smattering of old jazz photos from the 50's and 60's, is Lorine
Niedecker's poem, "Club 26," celebrating the place she dined at with
her husband every so often.

I understand that the Niedecker house is still standing by the
lake, and I was wondering if anyone knew of any efforts to preserve
it? Of course, if Pound's house is up for grabs and Keats's house is
falling down, maybe it's a lost cause. But maybe not: If Niedecker's
work adorns the wall of a smoky supper club bar, maybe there's some
community pride that could be tapped into? I'd be interested in
trying to help if the effort seems feasible... about an hour and a
half away. Anyone know anything?

This goes back to Hebronics again.  Maria's original post said pupik, not
pubik.

Your pupik is a couple of inches above your pubic area, it's your belly button.

Can't you Xtians ever get our language right?

Great idea of Helen in Egypt bringing the epik & pubik together though.

Subject:      Re: Bandit Queen

i haven't seen Bandit Queen, but i confess, i'm a little puzzled.  Mike
Boughn seems to be having trouble with a scene where a woman shoots a
number of men who gang raped her after it is clear that they will not be
punished for their crime by any other force.  this movie is based on a
real woman's life who really _was_ gang-raped by villagers and then blamed
and treated like a whore because of it in a class-rigid, woman-hating
rural society.  um, so, what is so bad about an audience feeling some
satisfaction to see this continued threat to her existence, people who
have done one of the most abusive, contemptuous things imaginable to a
person and feel no remorse, killed -- and killed instead of her, because
in the accounts i have read of this woman's life, post-rape, she received
death threats...

at the start of this thread, i wasn't sure what was being objected to
in the movie, and i'm still not clear on it.  but no, i wouldn't find it
a problem that i'm expected to feel pleased, as an audience member, when
a woman who has been mass-raped, beaten, disenfranchised, refused justice,
and had her life threatened finally fights back against her rapists...  i
WOULD find it a problem if i were expected to see her mass-raped, etc.,
then expected to excuse the people who did it ("oh, she was wearing
tight clothes," "oh, what was she doing out at night if she didn't want
it," "oh, they are poor, ignorant, down-trodden men who were just taking
their anger at their oppression out on her" etc.).

speaking of movies one walks out on because of content, i have a movie i
can't even bring myself to SEE because of content.  a reviewer mentioned
horror at the way "Breaking the Waves" is being given critical acclaim,
given that it is what sounds like an appalling glorification of oppression
and victimization of women... a woman's husband has an accident which makes
him unable to perform sexually, so he orders her to have sex with other men
as a way for him to have sexual pleasure third-hand.  evidently, the film
maker appears to think she is really as Good Woman, the Right Kind of Woman,
becuase she does.  even sex which becomes increasingly violent, till a
sailor who has raped, beaten, and mutilated her tells her to come back for
more, her husband orders her to do so, she does (that good, Griselda-myth
of a woman) and is murdered.  because she has been so dutiful, according
to the filmmaker, the last scene shows her ascending to heaven...

no one seems to be objecting to the appalling message of this film, its
extreme and even approving presentation of violence against women, the notion
that a good woman should do whatever her man tells her to, should be a
sade-like submissive (filmmker says, in interviews, that he read de sade
and was impressed.  used it as one of sources/bases for film!  he actually
BRAGS about that!) even if it, quite literally, kills her.

i dunno about you all, but i have so little stomach for violence against
women that i am not sure i could ever see even phoolan devi, where at least
it sounds like no one is trying to say its a great thing that she got raped...

Hen ry Gould had me by more than the lapels with his propositions today.
True, true, true, i felt, but i cant agree to the addenda. Just take New
Hampshire alone, an academic setting if ever there was one: brilliant
fucken poetry, HG, from Allan Fisher (an academic as far as employment
goes) to Chris Stroffolino (has darkened academic doorways) to Rae
Armantrout (educates La Jolla) to Bob Perelman (breaks out of the Penn) to
Peter Middleton (pedagogues in Old hants) to Barrett Watten (author of
Waning StAtes) to Tony Lopez (teaches college in Devonshire), and a number
besides who may or may not or who definitely dont teach, but who were going
to the far side of death and bringing back poetry into dread academic
context--Randolph Healy, Lisa Robertson, Deanna Ferguson, cris cheek, Miles
Champion, Denise Riley, Kathleen Fraser, Tom Raworth, Invidious
Distinctions, If Your Name Is Missing I Meant You,et al, et al, believe you
me, pal. It was poetry up there with John Keats and some dont even have
houses to fall apart, sad as that surely is. But true, true, true, Henry G,
until you began to crab out on us. db

george's posting today reveals to all the remarkable  b a l a n c e  of his
mind, as leftbrained as it is rightbrained. i'm afraid my own attempts to
emulate him by keeping a list of  h i s  books fell apart 'round about #50,
but i  d o  know that his most recent jeu d'espirt (sic,and as we canadians
say) should be appearing before too much longer, the wonderful
roman-a-clef-novel __Piccolo Mondo__, as funny as it is serious, as tall as
it is long, as broad as it is deep. You might send advance orders to the

doubt.  db

Maria -- I think "jivaro" is another version of "jibaro" -- Spanish
originally for "rustic or uncultured," as my DC friends used to describe
people who were, in their opinion, hopelessly "country" -- came to have
certain ethnic connotations in the New World --

Felipe Luciano, of the "original" last poets, has a famous poem that
begins "Jibaro, my pretty nigger," --


when will we see the last last poets?

hates books, but likes to read.  She only likes poetry - but she hates

ALL the rest are too sentimental.  She hates agendas.  Books are for
pure laziness; not even decadence, not even vulgarity - laziness, pure
and simple.  She hates everyone who's trying too hard.  She writes
poems herself - secret put-downs of ALL her suitors. She would never
be caught dead at a conference, a school, a coffeehouse, a library,

I'm pleased to announce the publication this week of "Poetry, Community,
Movement," a special double issue I've guest edited for Diacritics
(fall-winter 1996, vol. 26, numbers 3-4).  The issue is the first in the
journal's twenty-five year history devoted exclusively to contemporary
poetry.

Contributions to the opening "Text/Context" section include: Jonathan
Monroe -- "Poetry, the University, and the Culture of Distraction"; Rachel
Blau DuPlessis -- "Manifests"; Rosmarie Waldrop -- "Form and Discontent /
Four Prose Poems"; David Kellogg -- "Perloff's Wittgenstein: W(h)ither
Poetic Theory?";
Aldon Lynn Nielsen -- "Black Deconstruction: Russell Atkins and the
Reconstruction of African-American Criticism"; and Marjorie Perloff --
"Whose New American Poetry? Anthologizing in the Nineties."
The second half of the issue includes in its "Symposium" section: Jonathan
Monroe -- "Syntextural Investigations"; Ann Lauterbach -- "Misquotations
from Reality"; Bob Perelman -- "Poetry in Theory"; and Charles Bernstein --
"Community and the Individual Talent."  The issue concludes with "Poetry,
Community, Movement: A Conversation" (Charles Bernstein, Ann Lauterbach,
Jonathan Monroe, and Bob Perelman).

To order copies of the double issue ($12 each), write via e-mail to

Subject:      Re: Bandit Queen

I just wanted to make a humble suggestion that people actually --experience--
for themselves films/books/paintings before destroying them based on
potentially rigid feminist/or/otherwise interpretations.  Breaking the Waves
is one of the most aesthetically interesting and emotionally powerful films I
have ever seen. It does disturb your gut, and I spent the last hour of it
clenched in a tight spasm of tears, but I don't find that kind of visceral
emotional reaction offensive...I could see, on the other hand, how one might
be (if he/she didn't appreciate kitsch, that is) the cartoonish and tacky
qualities of something like "Baywatch."  Yes, Breaking the Waves is about
oppression, but I don't think Bess's husband can be so swiftly and cleanly
pinpointed as perpetrator.  The strict, island community, which is the
centripetal force of the film, and the notions of goodness versus evil/sin
therein, are more accurately the culprits.  I understood it less as a plot of
male/female sexual dynamics than as one of, yes, "goodness" in the face of
anti-Christian hypocrisy.  The husband's influence is also more ambivalent
than what you think; it is not entirely clear that his actions are not
sincerely motivated by a wish to liberate her from him, to free her from her
compulsive and (also unclear) psychologically-unstable love..."love so much
it hurts."  It takes a party pooper to spoil the end of the film, but since
the final scene is out of the bag, I think it worth noting that another way
to read the "heavenly ascent" is as an image of redemption and love's
justice...that the purity and goodness of unconditional, generous, unguarded
love that Bess strives for throughout the movie in her own dialogue with God
finally comes to her, and her wish is granted.  I understand  disgust at the
exploitation of violence, especially violence against women, but I would hope
such valid concerns would not keep us from appreciating the full
dimensionality of strange and human stories.

     The scene is long and clearly delights in showing the rapes. If memory
serves it even has slow motion sequences. It is a scopofilic (sp?) gaze to
be sure.

 this movie is based on a
>real woman's life who really _was_ gang-raped by villagers and then blamed
>and treated like a whore because of it in a class-rigid, woman-hating
>rural society.

     It is also about a *revolutionary* who has battled with the existing
social mores and the government and largely gotten away despite the odds for
years. The movie reduces Devi's life to nothing but an unending string of
rape scenes. And the only major plot development apart from her being raped,
the only thing she is depicted as doing for herself (apart from an early
scene of beating the crap out of her first rapist, her decidedly-ex husband)
is falling in love. Essentially, the movie's "dialectic" is that poor Devi
is constanly being raped and all she ever really wants is to fall in love.
Consequently, when she kills the rapists she is not, in the movie, seen to
be striking out against her society (the obvious aspects of which you
mention--class-rigid, woman-hating, rural, to which I would add colonized
and capitalistic) but against personal enemies.


>then expected to excuse the people who did it ("oh, she was wearing
>tight clothes," "oh, what was she doing out at night if she didn't want
>it," "oh, they are poor, ignorant, down-trodden men who were just taking
>their anger at their oppression out on her" etc.).

I think it could be argued that aspects of this movie's cinematography (sp?)
do just that: Devi is often made to appear particularly sexual before and
you could argue even during the rape scenes. This is to say that, as
mentioned above, it would not be too hard to argue that the camera has a
particularly male gaze.

i generally DO hesitate to dismiss without seeing, but in this case, since
seeing feeds into the box office figures, i think hesitation is warranted.
i find it hard to imagine how "purity and goodness of unconditional,
generous, unguarded love" can be distilled from a woman letting her husband
order her into increasingly violent and unpleasant sex which she doesn't
want because he finds it titillating.  the reviewer described, in particular,
a scene where she emerges from the hold of a ship after being raped by two
filthy, knife-wielding sailors, with her face beaten and cut into a jigsaw
puzzle.  anything that tries to make a claim for that being a good way, for
ANY reason, for a woman to be, seems to me far from having any possibility
of a redeeming dimensionality of strange and human stories.  considering that
she is sent back for MORE of this by her husband and is murdered by the same
two sailors... what could possibly redeem THAT?  the, uh, "freedom of speech"
governing larry flynts' "chester the molester" (a cartoon of a pedophiliac
molesting children by a man later convicted of molesting his own children),
woman in a meatgrinder, woman raped on a pool table, and tied and bloody
women offerings?  perhaps the true belief in a deep religious epiphany
available through suffering that "informed" the inquisition as they killed
people and just happened, oh yeah, to confiscate their land and holdings
along the way, along with any jewelry and money on the bodies of the, uh,
"redeemed"?

i don't mean to rant, but i think a line MUST be drawn making violence against
women glorified and used as subtext to sell and excite absolutely unacceptable.
i am concerned about making it illegal to print, since censorship is a bitter
and treacherous rally, but one can practice censorship of the pocketbook by
refusing to support, even by boycotting, anything attempting to sell or promote
violence against women.

also, i wouldn't call the review i saw narrow at all -- it is often fashionable
to deem any feminist document "narrow," but in fact, given that the dimensions
of effect on real-life, breathing, you-and-me women in most things of this
culture is routinely overlooked, subsumed, unexamined, and/or supressed, i've
found feminist criticism a very useful "second look."  think, for example, of
drug trials -- "oh, we've done extensive testing, so this is safe" IF you are
a white, college or middle aged male.  i've actually HEARD researchers say they
didn't test on pregnant women, or women, because the hormone cycles made it too
difficult to determine/write up results.  yes, those narrow, narrow feminists
noticing that since pregnant women and women were assumed to BE part of the
population affected, it might be nice if they were part of the testing... or
a myriad of other examples, but i think of feminist criticism as a determined
bringing to light of what we are made, by our society/culture/world, only too
wiling to not see...

ok, off my soapbox now...

After reading Kevin Killian's post the other day, I got Kristin's Helen

-- Clearly 50% of Knight's intro is directly lifted from Kristin
Prevallet's paper -- It would not have been enough simply to identify
Prevallet's essay as the source for the information in the intro., as
Knight has done much more than take information, but Knight didn't even
do that much -- Since she at one point quotes KP, and might therefore
expect that readers might look up the source of the quote one day for
further info, I don't know what Knight could have thought she was doing
-- I do think it's now time to examine the other "knight-authored"
sections of the book to see if more of this form of "scholarship" was
done --

aaahhhhhh, NOW i'm beginning to see...  one of those lets-make-the-violent-
shots-sexy kinds of movies.

bleCH!!!   and you are very right -- devi did much more than avenge her rape.
organizing a massive groundlevel resistance seems no mean feat -- how does
the movie get around that one?  oh yeah, the sex scenes.

i remember in clint eastwoods "Unforgiven" there was the most horrific scene
of violence against women, but i remember it being filmed in what felt like
a very sympathetic, woman's-point-of-view way and i could never say quite why
it felt like that (the rape and murder in "Platoon" had that same quality)
but i'm wondering, now, if it is a matter of camera shots -- if the shots are
taken, at least a significant number, from the "gaze" of the victim?

i just remember, from "Unforgiven," a sense, rare in movies, of the violence
not as quick and oh-isn't-this-a-fun-special-effect, but rather, chaotic,
hard to parse, TERRIFYING, and unforgivingly terrible.  one saw the utter
horror of such an act, its brutality.  i guess part of this was not flinching
away or glossing over the appalling aftermath -- the other women trying to
sew the wound, pack it with dressing and stop the bleeding, the raw masses
of cotton that could not contain the disaster and the clear swelling and
pain, the devastating effect on her of the scars, the pain and sympathy and
anger, and worst of all, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness her
injury invoked in everyone around her, even people who didn't, initially,
like her that much...

perhaps it is violence-in-context, as well, rather than violence-violence-violence
with no context?  some of later shots in "Unforgiven" seemed a mocking parody
of shoot-em-up cinema, where you got the "pretty" shooting scene, then you
got the decidely unpretty result, the ambiguities of what was supposed to be
simple revenge, the victims trying to move, their pain -- not just a quick
snappy gloss of them with gory special effect, but again, the unswerving look
at the simple, human, "this hurts" and bodily damage...

     If I may speak not only for myself but - sorry - for others on the
list: who do you think you're addressing? I think most people on her are
considerably open-minded; if anything they (we, I) err on the side of giving
too much weight to aesthetics compared to ethics. This isn't the Christian
Colition reading list. Furthermore, just as you can accuse people of not
"experience[ing]" films, etc. because of the imagined (guessed-at) moral
(representational) content, so also there is a certain complicity in going
to see such a film, since usually most people have a pretty good what
they're about to see... so from my perception of it, _Breaking the Waves_
does not look like enough of an "art film" to justify my attention in spite
of the apparent violence and sexism. I would take the risk of not seeing it
(for the cost of nearly an hour's wage) for the same reason I might risk not
seeing the latest...van Damme movie. Of course I could be convinced
otherwise, ie that the movie handles its subject matter in an intellectual,
sophisticated, artistic, righteous, complicated and/or "truthful" manner
rather than what I assume, which is a fairly simplistic, not very
complicated or -(sorry)- dialectical method. However, you have not convinced
me that it does. (As below.)

 Breaking the Waves
>is one of the most aesthetically interesting and emotionally powerful films I
>have ever seen.

     What does it mean to say "aesthetically interesting"? Leni Rosenthal's
films might be "aesthtically interesting" but it is still not difficult to
understand some people walking out of them; there is an aesthetics of
content too, if I can put it that way, and it may be something more than
"taste".

It does disturb your gut, and I spent the last hour of it

     Perhaps I don't appreciate kitsch. That is, its never held me in
tearful spasms.

 Yes, Breaking the Waves is about

     1.) Are you or is the film suggesting that "'goodness' in the face of
anti-Christian hypocrisy" is worth being humiliated, sexually abused, beaten
and killed? 2.) Occam's razor.

 The husband's influence is also more ambivalent

 Well than, he's an angel. This kind of disgustingly uneven pairing of
"opposites" on an ethical scale is exactly what makes me walk out of films.
"We had to destroy the woman to save her..."

It takes a party pooper to spoil the end of the film,

     The film described does indeed sound like a party...

 but since

     Please explain what is meant by this phrase.

     I for one am extremely tired of going to movies that looked interesting

almost nothing to say to their audiences other than "look at me, arn't I

both like that and also the ones by David Lynch. From your defense of the
film I'm putting it in a category with those.

My initial paracomments re Bandit Queen aren't/shouldn't be based on
the rape sequence (alone), nor on, what someone suggest, not seeing
it (for rigidly feminist or whatever whatevers) or dismissing it
(seen or unseen) (based on rigidly feminist or whatever whatevers).

I've seen it. I see a whole lotta films. I like a whole lotta filsm,
movies too. Et cinema, brute'.
I speak/know several South Asian languages. Lived in India. Didn't
take Bandit Queen as if I thought I was going to the Travels In India
series at your local community college.

What I mean is this:
as whatever kind of movie you take it as,
spaghetti westerns, pee wee;s big adventure, freddie's back part lxiv,
the piano pianissimo, verite, austin's workout tapes, whatever...
Bandit Queen is bad. It is bad. It's a bad bad bad movie. It's a really
bad film. Bad.

ok Aldon, you can enjoin me anytime at all. and thanks for the info, which
i'll follow up--usually interesting to see a scholar writing about people
one knows & their works: works which one has "incorporated" until (though
one couldnt have done them) they feel like a part of oneself.Its like
getting yr drivers license in the mail, or passport photo. Now its official
and you dont look happy any more. But then again, it  h a s  to be you,
too, its just that the lighting and the equipment arent your usual visuals.
And after all, you always  w a n t e d  a drivers license and a passport.
They make it easier to get around, a n d  they signal arrival. I come to
realize the partiality with which I had been reading these associates, that
I hadnt glimpsed the look their work turns towards the camera. Its like
going into an unknown restaurant and spotting a photo of lorinne niedecker.
Does that niedeckerize the restaurant more than it restaurantizes
niedecker? Feelings that shimmer like that are those some among us prefer,
and they depend upon the certainties of other parties for their
origination. What can be given in return is an open question, I daresay,
like Robin Blaser's "Whatever".

Armand Schwerner (who never answers his email [well, hardly ever]),
recommends *Tales of the Hasidim, the Early Masters* Martin Buber,
NY:Shocken 1947. It's a classic, but I think _must_ be read with Gershon
Scholem's critique and corrective, "Martin Buber's Interpretation of
Hasidism," in his _The Messianic Idea in Judaism_ (Schoken pb). Buber's
_Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism_ (same publisher) bears looking at, too.
And Eliade, _Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy_ (Princeton/Bollingen
Series LXVII) is a locus classicus. Incidentally, and lest I bring down the
wrath of the Schwerner, who has powers of his own (I've heard that the mere
hint of a flame has been known to bring down immolation on the flamer),
anyone interested should run immediately to his ongoing and I hope
never-ending masterwork, _The Tablets_, for as good an example of multiple
possessions as one could hope to find. To the uninitiated I say no more, for
fear of ruining the surprise.

Jibaro is a term I've seen (or heard) in much Puerto Rican song -- with
distinct, often celebratory, ethnic connotations. My sense is it's similar
to gitano (gypsy) in Andalusian culture. Not sure, however, if it's the
same as "jivaro"...

Another person who might know about Niedecker's home is Glenna Breslin
of St. Mary's College. She is working on a biography of Niedecker and read
a lovely paper on her relationship with her neighbor, Aeneas McAllister at
last spring's Orono poetry of the '50's conference. It sounded like she
has been tracking Niedecker's living situations.

Well, I don't know why Phoolan Devi wanted the movie suppressed. If
the events the movie represents occurred in the way they are
represented, I certainly would understand why she, personally, might
want to blow all those guys away.

Nevertheless, I still have a deep suspicion of individuals who
manipulate images in such a way as to incite homicidal feelings in
large numbers of strangers. Call me an old anachronistic Enlightenment
goof.

It probably comes from hanging out with Maoists in the olden dayes,
and seeing the way that a passion for justice can be manipulated so
that very nice people end up doing very cruel things--exactly the
opposite of what they thought they had set out to do--all in the name
of justice. It's like all those people running through the
streets looking for Jews to kill because somebody told them that the
Jews drank the blood of Christian babies.

Who wouldn't want to kill them?

intentional fallacy. but it brings up an interesting question: does a film
maker's decision to show violence necessarily mean that s/he's condoning
violence? or can it be a critique of violence?

her husband doesn't tell her to go back; the reasons why she goes back are
several and complex. one could also argue that she chose to go back,
knowing she would die.

actually, you don't see her "ascending to heaven": you see church bells

again, how can we assert what the "message" of the film is? this argument
seems to privilege authorial intent.

de sade:  i'm gonna risk an avalanche of invectives thrown my way and ask
some questions about de sade: what do you mean by saying the film-maker
was "impressed" by de sade? does reading de sade mean yr a "bad" person?
i'd be curious to know how many people on the list have read de sade. how
many have read de sade's work in the academy? has anyone noticed how
conspicuously absent he is from the academy-endorsed 18th century canon?
is this because he was a hack, or does it have to do with a timidity among
scholars in grappling with these "morally problematic" works? is ignoring
de sade a critical, informed, and intelligent stance? i don't think so.
while the acts depicted in de sade's works are, yes, _horrible_, it's also
horrible to categorically censor art based on hearsay. i know people
who refuse to read freud because his work is reported to be  "misogynous
and phallo-centric." yes, his work is phallo-centric; but what if kristeva
had come to that conclusion and refused to read him? this sort of
censorship breeds ignorance and mis-information. it is to art what
turning off the evening news is to the world: turning away from violence
doesn't "make it go away."  whatever happened to know-thy-enemy?

"breaking the waves" can also be seen as a critique of back-woods,
patriarchical societies that base their authority on judeo-christian
precedent (i.e., continuing the patriarchical traditions found within the
bible). because the protagonist doesn't rise above her oppressive
conditions doesn't mean that the film is condoning oppression.
if she had transcended the patriarch, it would have smacked of the
it's-a-wonderful-life b.s. that hollywood feeds us. sadly, these
heroic-fantasy films are the ones that gross millions, because so many
people are afraid to face art that addresses violence without lapsing into
unrealistic heroism. this is also why westerns and the whole post-viet nam
rambo stuff went over so well: we'll solve our problems on hollywood stage
sets. those who censor art because of its "graphic depictions" of
violence, sexuality, would have art be a way of turning away from the
world, refusing to aknowledge how horrifying it can be. that, to me, is
the real danger.

But isn't your argument similar to

"I haven't read Ezra Pound, but he's a fascist anti-Semite, so the poetry
can't be any good."

Doesn't the way in which these situations may be presented within the
context of the films count for anything?  Can't you trust that someone
who's seen Bandit Queen can have a problem with this presentation? Is a
film that has been perceived, to be inartfully manipulative, a good film if
you believe in the idea they're shilling for?

To bring it round to a film I HAVE seen, a lot of the praise for John
Sayles' Lone Star seems to be based on the political sentiments he projects
(which, for the most part, I agree with) and not the film itself, which I
think is no better or worse than most network television programs.  But
maybe that's just me.

It's great that there are filmmakers with progressive values who are able
to work within the film industry, but intentions alone do not make a good
art.

Does anyone out there now if "Jivaro" is the name that group of Indios
gave themselves, as heard and transliterated by colonizers, or if the
Portuguese named them that?  I suspect the latter, which is why I also
suspect the relationship to "jibaro," but I know neither enough "Jivaro"
history nor enough Portuguese -- and wouldn't you know it, budget cuts
have pretty much removed Portuguese expertise from our campus, despite
the rather large population of speakers of that language in the state --

When more than 50 messages are posted to the list in a single day, the
listserv program automatically shuts down the list. We then must manually
restart it, which usually happens quickly but can take up to a day.
        This is a good occasion for me to thank Joel Kuszai for his
extraordinary help in managing the list: mostly sorting through hundreds of
error messages (bounced poetics posts) and helping with various subscription
problems. The list could not function without his generous commitment.

        But in what manner no better or worse? are objecting to the "style"
of the filming: the framing (or lack there of), the colors (or absence), the
relative stability of the camera, etc., or to the acting or what?
        I thought Lone Star one of the best movies of the last several
years--and not just because its general politics were agreeable, but because
its artistic merit seemed closely on a par with its political stance, its
statements about the perception of regional and personal histories.
        Perhaps its a leap, but I guess I'm tempted to compare its style as
roughly comparable to a novel by Dostoevsky (in translation! (sadly)): that
is to say, the "art" of the thing is less in its style than in its content,
but the two inescapably influence each other. I also suggest Dostoevsky
because I think Sayles' method of analysis of the society in Lone Star is
similar to Dostoevsky's in, for example _The Devils_ (or _Demons_ in the
latest English trans.): the society is seen from the standpoint of human
interaction, and the film's method seems to be to reiterate the
circumstantial influence on the character's perceptions by bring the same
group of people into contact at different times in different places with
different sorts of knowledge.
        I thought that Sayles' handling of this, and his script, and the
unobtrusive clarity of the camera and acting was of the highest order.
Certainly much better than the tube, IMO.

        I think you pose an interesting question, an area for someone to
examen closely, given the violent content of most movies today. Violence is
certainly the pin holding together american (contemporary foreign films are,
I believe, from what few of them I have seen, no exception) films of of all
kinds of genres: not only the old "gangster" and "western" genres, but many
"romance" films, comedys, "arthouse" films: the fascination with guns and
their effects seems unending, in Hollywood and out. What are the various
circumstances of modern film violence? How are acts of violence shown?
        The scopofilic gaze coigned, I believe, by Laura Mulvey, and
borrowed, I believe, by Frederic Jameson concerns those moments in which the
"forward" motion of the film (the plot, the events, the interactions between
charactes, the scenes that give modern film its almost relentlessly forward
moving narrative) is halted, usually in order to give a better view of the
female body. So when the femme fatale arrives the camera pauses on her
thighs and the forward motion of the action is halted. Then later some of
the more college-educated directors started playing with the idea and you
get Scorcese or DePalma or whoever pausing the film (often with the
technology of slow motion) on depictions of violence. The beauty of violence
this suggests.

        Yes. Its interesting though about the circumstances around the
filmed act of violence. Showing the aftermath seems effective at times, but
at other times (eg, say, "Resevoir Dogs") it seems merely gratuitious: the
film hoping to make a greater aesthetic shock by "showing more." And then,
as you mention, there is also the context of the plot of the film to take
into account:

>
>perhaps it is violence-in-context, as well, rather than
violence-violence-violence
>with no context?

 I see this as how the characters react to this violence in their world. I
think when I am in the theater this is the most effective strategy, both for
making the violence truly horrific and effectively "realistic" (which people
might object to but I particularly enjoy films that come as close as
possible to documentary styles: this has always seemed the most effective
use of film, to me (ie, rather than special effects, etc.)) (cinema verite,
almost). For example, I am thinking of two films by Werner Herzog with
similar names: "Woteck" and "Strozek". The depiction of violence in these
films (in one a soldier murders his wife, in the other a woman and a man are
beaten up) is strikingly different, but I would argue equally effective. In
one the violence is done shown in slow motion and is beautiful and
horrifying at once; in the other it happens quickly and is barely seen in
the dim light: but in both the effect of the violence on the participants:
the murder, the victims, etc., is central to all the following scenes.



 some of later shots in "Unforgiven" seemed a mocking parody
>of shoot-em-up cinema, where you got the "pretty" shooting scene, then you
>got the decidely unpretty result, the ambiguities of what was supposed to be
>simple revenge, the victims trying to move, their pain -- not just a quick
>snappy gloss of them with gory special effect, but again, the unswerving look
>at the simple, human, "this hurts" and bodily damage...

        Then of course too is the fact that many of the earlier westerns
show almost no violence at all. The final shoot-out in "Stage Coach" for
example, when the camera cuts away just as the Duke fires first... But then
that movie more than compensates for such "lack" by gunning down in open
view several dozen Indians, the blink of an eye...

      What are more examples?

Lone Star was certainly enjoyable (I watched it with some buddies while
quaffing a pint of Wild Turkey at the Flatirons Theater), but I didn't find
it as noteworthy as you did Matthias. For me, Sayles is a filmmaker who
thinks he's at his most poetic when he's merely being baldly schematic. I
worked with him briefly on a project about Ellis Island for Propaganda Films
a few years ago -  nothing came of it, sotry of my life - but he's a nice
guy. Still, there were some wonderful grace notes in the film.
Unfortunately, it dissolved into a lot of froth.

This response from resident software architect.

Re actual nuts and bolts:

Initialization, of, I assume, a session with a computer system.
There's what's known as transient state associated to such a beast --
you will find hidden underneath in the deep dank basement a set
of running software programs that are needed to keep that connection
alive. They have state, data, that needs to be set in order for the
programs to function. Things like where this connection is coming from,
the port number etc etc etc. That set-up, and getting these programs
going, is called initialization.

There is an opposite to initialization; when the session is dropped and
all that transient data is forgotten. Of course, some of it may get
logged, so that Big Brother can keep track of his minions.

Establishment: when the connection is actual, live, and ready to go ---
both endpoints are there, know about each other and can start yammering
away.

Authentication. To do with computer security ---- is Mr. DB at the
end of the line really Mr. DB, or some other sinister influence?
How would the system know? How would we ever know? The protocol for
authentication usually involves exchange of protected/encrypted data,
such as passwords.

Dear members of the list:

At publishers weekly, where I work, we are preparing a poetry feature
for an upcoming issue. The approach is to devise a piece that will assist
booksellers (and others) in knowing what the different
disciplines/schools/programs/ aesthetics are across the poetry spectrum
in the U.S, and connect, where possible, each segment to the houses
that publish them, the companaies that  distribute them, the journals that
keep their authors' new work out there, or the writing programs that fuel
them, or the influences that are their foundation.

At the moment, we are thinking of such segments as Language poets,
multicultural poetics, or latino and black and asian, gay and lesbian
poetries, spoken or performance poetry, St. Mark's of New York School,
formalist, mainstream perhaps, experimental maybe, classical, poetry in
translation, etc.

Although I realize that some may see such reckoning and partitioning a
woeful disservice, i think that, for the purposes of knowing how to stock
a poetry section and keeping it both deep and contemporary, such an
approach can be helpful.

I would appreciate hearing from anyone who agrees that this may be
useful, and who might have advice to offer on the various
camps/alliances etc.

Of course, i welcome comments from those who wish to dissent as
well.

My suggestion is that for poets who are still alive, to ask them what
category they wish to be in.  My choice for myself would be mainstream,
because lawd knows, Ive been spending my life trying to fit into the
mainstream.

just a note to thank everyone who attended the inaugural poetry reading of the
"alternative verbal arts" series and, for non-attendants, to describe the event.
miekal and was wearing a coat made of scraps of cloth with words on them,
entirely handstitched by a friend, zebra-striped pyjama pants, and an earring
that was a tiny book of pen and ink designs.  that about sums up the atmosphere.
he read some poetry, then played some of his charming computer poems for us,
which featured some word-animation, sound, and visual/collage like material.
play and inventiveness was the main agenda.  he showed a few parts of the
hypertext he and i are collaborating on; shd have a website in a few days.  he
finished with a love poem, fairly conventional in syntax and content,
accompanying himself on amplified home-made ocarinas that looked like gourds and
sounded haunting, esp w/ the echo effect of the amp.  then he sold material,
print and graphic, from his Xexoxial Editions press.  the crowd (a fulll house)
was pretty diverse: a couple of undergrads including brian horihan, the
organizer whose UROP grant is sponsoring the event, and a creative writing major
named martin; a number of folks from the mfa program in creative writing
(including anna reckin, elissa raffa, jenny willoughby and some people whose
names i don't know), some american studies and history students, a few people
from the alternative arts community and teachers of permaculture, three faculty
members and some students from the lit program such as laurie dickinson, who
doubled as tech support, and curt leitz. it was fun to see people who know each
other from different parts of their lives run in to each other there (like, an
amstud student and an experimental theatre person; a history student and a
soo-line garden founder) and express delighted surprise.  the refreshments,
provided by creative writing, were elegant and went like hotcakes.  all in all,
a gala event.  next week's event will most likely be more subdued with fewer
visuals, but engaging and cool nonetheless.  again, thank you all--maria damon

Permaculture is an international movement of designers, ecologists,
gardeners, community planners, & more fringe elements such as myself. I
use its design principles in all facets of life including my art, my
relationships, village design, education & teaching, sex & play.  Some
easy ways to think of natural design is to think of the following ideas:
"everything gardens", "the most amount of change with the least amount
of effort", "the problem is the solution", "work with nature, rather
than against", "the yield of a system is theoretically unlimited".

Long time Australian permaculture teacher Bill Mollison says:

"Permaculture is the conscious design and maintenance of agriculturally
productive ecosystems which have the diversity, stability, and
resilience of natural ecosystems.  It is the harmonious integration of
landscape and people providing food, energy, shelter, and other material
& non-material needs in a sustainable way.  Without permanent
agriculture there is no possibility of a stable social order."

The first piece of advice that sprang to my mind is that _Publishers'
Weekly_ might think of a poetry piece that looks at poetry that comes from
outside the USA as well as US poetry. A lot of the US poets I know feel
affiliations with lots of international poetries, in English and other

Subject:      Names are not Objects

Miekal,

I've always wondered about the origin of your name.

Names do seem particularly unstable with regards to people. I only
recognized "the artist formerly known as prince" in Fargo from his
symbol in the credits (he's the one shot in the snow after the chase
scene). What was his name before it was Prince?

There was of course Edward Howard Symmes (R Duncan)

Not mention such favorites as
Carolyn Ochs (Lyn Hejinian)
Mary Korkegian (Rae Armantrout)
George Palmer (aka Michael)
Robert Davidson (aka Michael)

and if my granddaddy had not been adopted many decades back, I'd be Ron
McMahon.

Such is life.

According to Switchboard.com there are 6 Ron Sillimans in the US listed
in various white pages. I've probably ruined their reputations. And
when we first moved to Paoli, there was a Jesse Silliman living
directly across the street from us (one of my sons is Jesse). (Let's
see, if there are 6 of them in a nation of 270 million, the odds of any
one being at an address is roughly 1 in 65 mill, the odds of two across
the street would be pretty darn high: why can't I win on odds like that
in the lottery?), but she was a she and he's a he, in spite of the
spelling. There's even a second Krishna Evans (name of my wife) living
in Houston, TX. And we had a childcare helper in Berkeley whose name
also was Krishna (particularly unusual in that, like Jesse, it's
normally a masculine form).

So what's the tale of Liz Was (not her current name either as I
recall)?

Ron Silliman

Subject:      Film thread

John Sayles has made several movies that are as one-dimensional as any
piece of agitprop (viz. Matewan), but Lone Star isn't one of those.
Rather, like Brother from Another Planet, it struck me as quite
transcendant of such values (they're there but sort of implicit
throughout and not really what the film hangs on). Lots of great
cameos, like Tony Ameandola's (sp?) Mexican used car dealer. If this is
equivalent to what's on TV, they must have better TV there than we get
in Philly.

Hey, but then I liked the English Patient (it's an interesting
transformation from the book in that each treats a different level as
the frame story and a different level as "the focus"), but I admit to
being a sucker for its self-indulgences (both film and book, for that
matter). It'd make a great double bill with The Sheltering Sky (a truly
great film and book) and a triple bill (does any theater do that
anymore?) with Antonioni's The Passage.

A truly bad film (violence as porn) might be The Missouri Breaks (was
that Pekinpaugh or Penn?) which treats the acts of killing in exactly
the same episodic method that a cheap porn flick would getting from one
sex scene to the next, each more violent than the one before.

Last film I walked on was El Topo. Last video I turned off halfway
through was Bridges of Madison County (Meryl Streep in her same old
swedish accent posing as Italian immigrant: "Ja, Ve are Italian"). My
Cousin Vinny was the one before that. (A good rule: avoid anything that
might end up being shown uncut on a transcontinental flight.)

Poets to include: High, Prevallet, Shvarts, Mandelstam, Villon, Wright
(all 10 of them), Dickinson, Sappy (all 100 of them), Gould (lower shelf -
remainders), Savage Reader (note: add poison warning - hold chapbook
at least 2 ft from nose), Ashbery, Berrigan (all 4 of them), Berryman,
Henry Pussycat, Florida Sweets (Valentine seasonal market), Louise
Chan Littletree (has anyone read this poet yet?  What is wrong with you
people?).  - Henry Gould

p.s. throw in a few NY School-bred Language epic beat-up New Coast
Af-Am Brazilian elderly Swedish lesbian garbage-can-lid-challenged
Hopi smartass adolescent mute performance slang nu-english poets
just to make it interesting.  & make sure they're all Irish.  Best of

Certainly in terms of narrative form. Very few narrative films, especially
from the States, end with such an intense rush to resolve all narrative
threads, while this is quite common in network tv.   Aside from overall
production values being better in film, I think this kind of closure may be
one of the strongest differences between narrative as presented in the two
media.

In general, it seems to me you're arguing for some kind of social realism,
style in the service of progressive content ("the 'art' of the thing is
less in its style than in its content") whereas I see Lone Star as a
manipulative allegory (Sayles HAS done far worse in this mode, what's the
name of that mining/labor film?).  I'd rather see progressive content
mirrored in a progressive style

I'm certainly not getting what I want from a movie like Lone Star, but I
also think it would be possible to get a lot closer to what you want then
what Sayles creates in this film.

I do like a lot of the bit parts, Francis McDormand (from Fargo) as the
ex-wife of Chris Cooper's character, for instance, is great.  I like the
flashbacks as pans across the scene, rather than the more usual breaks that
signal such a change in a lot of films.  But as to the various stylistic
features you raise, I can only say that what you see as "unobtrusive
clarity", just seems lackluster & uninspired to me.

this is picking up on the trhead i tried to inaugurate some weeks ago,
suggesting that we all tell each other the origins of our names.  i love this
kind of thing, seems kabalistic to me.  i was really unnerved to find out, in
the course of chris funkhouser's trying to show me how to use the web, that
there's an undergrad at brown u called Maria Damon.  in addition, last yeear
when i was on the cape, the cape cod times featured a ltter to the editor about
a heartbreaking photo of a guy who'd lost his dog, and how voyeuristic the photo
was, and wasn't it hard enough for the poor guy to have lost his dog, w/o having
to see his photo in the paper, etc.,,,signed by Maria Damon.  then, on returnin
here, i reconnected w/ my former health care workers to provide me w/ a
prescription for medication.  the nurse called me back and said, when did you
switch to your current medication? i sd i'd always been on it, and no other.
when's yr date of birth she sd, and when i told her, she sd, that solves it,
we've got another patient with your same name and i was getting you mixed up.  i
know some of you have names that are pretty common (miekal, one of my danish
cousins changed her name to be the only one of its kind in the danish phone
book, cuz their names are all frederiksen, larsen, rasmussen, etc) but i tend to
think of my name as unusual.  oh well.

I believe the given name is Prince Rogers (or Rodgers) Nelson.

All I know re: my own name is that my father was born in 1907, not long
before Oklahoma became a state, in its dusty northwest corner, and named
after the last territorial governor who became the first state governor:
Charles Haskell. So my dad was the first Charles Haskell Alexander and I am
technically a "jr." although that got dropped when I was a teenager or
perhaps even before.

Once a policeman came looking for me in my studio in Tucson and was very
surprised when I came to the door, as he had a warrant for a Charles
Alexander who was 6 foot 4 inches tall (I'm 5 foot 10) and a different
color. But that's better than my wife, who lives in the same town here with
another Cynthia Miller who used to run an animal grooming business but now
is a convicted (and much publicized) animal abuser who didn't do jail time
but had big fines and can never have pets again. We thought she got off
lightly. My wife has considered changing her name to mine (last only;
although I guess we could have two Charles Alexanders in the same house)
because of it, but so far hasn't taken such a step.

what's in a name?

This issue of labelling is fascinating, and is going to be around for the
foreseeable future.  My first response, Michael, is:  assuming any broad
usefulness to such an approach, what label would you attach to your own
work??  The question isn't only rhetorical...it would be really
interesting to know.  I don't think I could/would attach one to mine.  (A
less interesting example, as you probably haven't seen it..)

To avoid labelling, I've developed a habit of referring to what I like as
"interesting poetry,"  with the converse of that being mainstream, or just
"not very interesting."

A very interesting parallel to what you-all are doing:  in the 1980's I
lived in Boston; the famous poetry bookshop Groliers had a good selection
of LangPo books & chapbooks;  but they had them on a separate shelf
labelled (literally) "Language Poetry."  Now on the one hand many area
poets thought that was an absurd ghettoization intended to keep this
stuff (which somehow wasn't real) from infecting the rest of the 15,000 or
whatever volumes in the store.  ALL the rest, you see, were in a single A
to Z sequence.  On the other hand, several young poets I knew found this a
useful way to find out who & what LangPo was, when they hadn't had direct
contact with anyone who could tell them; and while they saw in principle
what was wrong, the arrangement helped them at a crucial point of
exploration...

Since your publication has to do crucially with marketing, it seems hard
for it to avoid labelling.  It is interesting to consider the
alternative...That would be (to be acceptable to the majority of folks on
this list) for Publisher Weekly (and Groliers) to not ghettoize, BUT to
give Nate Mackay & Susan Howe & Clark Coolidge & David Shapiro as much
attention & publicity as Amy Clampitt.  (Of course they should get much,
much more.)  The thing about these labelling approaches is that they are
often the only way mainstream institutions are willing to give ANY real
space to stuff outside the mainstream.

The New York Times (Thurs. 6 Feb. 97, B-13) ran a nice obit for Mitch
Goodman, the largest of the day, except for Pamela Harriman. But it's too
bad they couldn't have bothered to proofread it, or maybe just don't know
any bettter, so the world gets this: "...after meeting a young English
poet, Denise Leverton, at a youth hostel in Geneva..." and later "But by
the time Miss Leverton had collected signatures from hundreds of artist and
writers for an antiwar advertisement...."
     Ron, maybe not all name changes are voluntary! It's just another
reminder that someone we know and love as a household word more or less
doesn't ring any bells in the power centers.

it may be useful in this regard to consider jed rasula's account of current
poetic practice in _the american poetry wax museum_... rasula identifies
"four zones" of the contemporary american "poetry world": the associated
writing programs; the new formalism; language poetry; and "various
coalitions of interest-oriented or community-based poets" (440)... now i'm
not suggesting that one should adhere precisely to these "zones" in laying
out publishing or distributing criteria, only that such zones may be a
start in thinking about what poetry communities are 'out there'...

It's Kevin Killian.  I would like to announce the publication of my new
book, "Arctic Summer" and urge all of you to look for it in your
bookstores, to get it from the publisher, or to get it from SPD.  It is my
first novel in 7 years and took me 10 years to write.  Maybe some of you
will like it, it's set in the poetry scene of the 50s, starts out in New
York and winds up at Black Mountain College in North Carolina.  Some of you
will know that "Arctic Summer" was the name of the novel E M Forster began,
then abandoned, about this time.

about tv:  i don't quite think it's what it used to be...

'nypd blue' or 'er' or 'murder one' are, to my mind, doing some pretty
extraordinary things... both visually and structurally, they're outdoing
many of the films around, and have the added advantage of serial length...
easy to see this if you have cable:  just watch 15 minutes or a half-hour
of nypd blue, and then click around and have a look at the various films on
the various networks (that is, if you can bring yourself to pull
away---it's pretty addictive stuff)...

anyway... just didn't want tv to take a complete and customary beating over
and against (non-tv) film... though of course commercials continue to be a
downer...

Having wandered in what felt like poetic Siberia (and a partly
self-imposed one), I don't mind being associated with a "school." I know
the designations aren't accurate, but then we could say that all words are
labels and slippery, and so remain mute. IMO, all communication is
inaccurate, but it's all we got. I agree with Miekal, however, that you
might want to ask the poet. I wouldn't be pleased if somebody read an
Elizabethan sonnet I had published and decided I was a neo-formalist. (Not
that there's anything wrong with neo-formalists!) I also like the zone
idea of Jed Rasula.

While we're discussing doubles (c. alexander and c. alexander), how many
people have discovered that they live in the same SMALL town as a fellow
list member? I discovered that Wendy Battin and I both live in the same
real world. (Hello, Wendy! I even went to Conn. Coll. for a while in the
early 70s before being put on academic probation.) Which brings me full
circle. Maybe I'm not in poetic Siberia after all.

Interesting point, Joe. I don't really find those shows all that compelling
except in a shopworn Dickensian sort of way. I watch them, but I seldom stay
with them. They're all so self-important. Esp. the X-Files. I confess I'd
rather watch The Simpsons. I'm actually coming to believe that the TV
commercial is the late 20th Century American art form par excellence:
religious redemption/micro narrative that can't be beat for cognitive
recognition/compression.

about tv:  i don't quite think it's what it used to be...

'nypd blue' or 'er' or 'murder one' are, to my mind, doing some pretty
extraordinary things... both visually and structurally, they're outdoing
many of the films around, and have the added advantage of serial length...
easy to see this if you have cable:  just watch 15 minutes or a half-hour
of nypd blue, and then click around and have a look at the various films on
the various networks (that is, if you can bring yourself to pull
away---it's pretty addictive stuff)...

anyway... just didn't want tv to take a complete and customary beating over
and against (non-tv) film... though of course commercials continue to be a
downer...

best,

patrick, i agree that such tv shows may be burdened by "self-importance"...
but, again, i think the same could be said of many, many films these
days... i'd argue that characterization on nypd blue is as complete, as
subtle, as many hollywood releases... now whether one goes for same is
probably a somewhat different matter...

as to commercials:  was a time i watched mtv just for the commercials!...
but i haven't yet developed the cognitive skills to enjoy commercial
interrupt at the rate, say, that i see on tnt... esp. not as the night
wears on...

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Actually, I had a second question in response to your posting, Michael,
and forgot to include it: you mention "experimental" as a possible
catagory, separate from LangPo---just who/what would you put into that?

There was a really interesting thread about the use of words like
"experimental" here, before my time but accessible in the archive.  I've
been party to several such exchanges, over the years, and still don't know
how to handle the whole issue of describing, well, interesting poetry,
except as: what I find interesting (or exciting);  anything else tends to
make you a party to the trivialization of your own taste and your own
writing.. (As I said at first, I can understand Pub. Weekly doing
labelling, as its reason for being is explicitly related to marketing;
tho that doesn't keep me from being uneasy even so--But your posting got
me thinking about how the rest of us relate to labels, as poets and
writers and readers, and publishers and editors...)

One of the best illustrations of how intractable this problem is (and one
of the things that first got me thinking about it several years ago):
many of the high-profile poets I admire (Bernstein, Silliman, Perelman, an
others)  would refer, in some essay or public exchange, to innovative or
experimental or avant-garde poetry;  and it would startle me, because it
always seemed to me that such labels were strongly weighted toward
allowing mainstream types to dismiss interesting writing. (As opposed
to the phrase Language Writing itself, in its various permutations, which
became part of a conscious effort to get certain work recognition in a
stiffling institutional context, and that strategy of course worked.)  But
once I thought about it, I saw how hard it was to talk about things at
all, without one of these labels as a handle...I myself am made most
uncomfortable by the "a" word (avant-garde), which is especially loaded
with baggage that's guaranteed to put people off and pinpoint a poet's
work as special, beyond the pale, not to be taken seriously, under a sort
of glass dome...

Gee, I bet I'm one of several hundred poets on this list whio don't fit into
any of those categories. How about "don't like to join clubs" as an
interest-oriented group? There's an appropriative subtext here. The world is
divided into the smarmy-conservative, the retro-precious,
politico/ethno/gender/erotico-based, and I guess everyone else is langpo?
At the very least that dulls the blade.

John Sayles is certainly a goody-goody, but Matewan as agitprop? What would
you have liked, a sympathetic view of the motivations of people who hire
thugs to kill the defenseless? That was the American mining industry in the
good old days of laissez-faire. Despite the sins that have been committed in
its name, there was a reason for American radicalism to be born. It wasn't
just a commie plot.
Or maybe it's the notion that, at least at moments, disparate groups of
people have been able to see their situation as similar enough that they
could think to act together? It has been known to happen, although the
benefits have often been stolen from them.

Thanks to Mark Weiss for defending Sayles's _Matewan_, and on just the
right grounds.  Maybe the List's ambient negative feelings towards
the one IWW (Iowa Writers Workshop) have inadvertently spilled over
onto the more noble organization that also bears that acronym.

But how can I be trusted, I even liked the film-essay (done on a
visibly diminished budget relative to the lushness of realist
composition in _Matewan_) that Sayles made in 1991, _City of Hope_.

i'm glad someone wove together today's two threads, about poetry
schools and personal names. they seem to intone some of the same
themes, or the same theme, that people zealously guard their
uniqueness, and the notion of being part of a school or, as maria damon
offered, having another person of the same name at a writing program at
brown, is , in maria's words, unnerving. someone suggested asking the
poets themselves what school they would identitify with; someone
asked me to do the same. so let me take that on, not than anyone out
there knows what i've done or been doing but that won't matter much:

i identitify, and have for some time, with lots of work, stevens first,
zukofsiy second, stein third, then, thunderingly, mac low: after that, lots
of the language folks, but further on, for reasons related to god knows
what, my life, a few of the irish poets, muldoon and a few others, writing
about place. but looking at my work, OBJECTIVELY, i icould not argue
with someone who said it looked like language poetry, though i would not
argue if someone said it was derivative of same, or just a mimicking of
same, but in any case wouldn't care much, because I never wrote to an
audience that had another poet in it. In the context in which this issue
came up, i was and am only eager to have a bookseller know a good
way to talk about someone's work and know how to associate it with
someone else's work with which a prospective buyer might be familiar.


as for my name, i was adopted, so name is chance (as it always is in
some sense) so when i see other michael coffeys crop up on the trw
reports denying me credit even though those others have condos
somewhere they are or are not paying off, it doesn't unnerve me. I don't
really feel unique, though i like to pretend i am, particularly to my son. i
don't want him holding someone else's hand.

This is an interesting problem--we want to direct readers to the work, and
we want the work noticed, but we don't want to be misrepresented. I suggest
that the categories have to be broad to the point of stupidity--their only
purpose is the least subtle form of marketing. Try this out--if a music
store descided that "jazz" was too broad and imprecise a category it would
probably wind up with more argumentative sub-categories than the store would
have space to show. As it is, if I go to my local jazz section I know I
won't find Rachmaninoff, but I may find what I'm looking for alphabetically,
and someone who shares the same initial may seem worth a try as well.
Broadness/dumbness of category is also at least not likely to become
canonical (or cannonical) definition. I could live with "experimental" or
"new" or "non-mainstream" because it doesn't try to shoehorn me too narrowly
into uncomfortable limitations.

Last night I backchannelled Michael Coffey as follows. You'll note my
general disapproving tone (it may be necessary, but I don't have to like
it). And I also suggest a few obvious problems that could present some comic
possibilities. Do Brathwaite and Walcott lie down together? For these
purposes, does it matter?


If you must do this, keep it simple. Remember that now as in the past what
looked like differences of substance were often differences of social
circle. So, O'Hara and Olson attract overlapping audiences who don't read
Jorie Graham, although the two guys didn't drink together. Maybe Formalist,
Mainstream, New (or Experimental), and Special Interest (defined by gender,
sexual orientation, race and ethnicity). Keep in mind that this is a
slippery slope--in that last category or perfectly conventional
lesbian/hispanic/black poets who would have nothing to do with their more
experimental brethren and sistren, regardless of shared ancestry or
proclivities. And there are those whose work falls into more than one camp.
But if you parse this further you risk disintegration.

mark, there may of course be problems with rasula's categories... but the
claim for poetic autonomy (on the part of poets, i mean) seems to come with
the territory, and is in many cases simply not so, when considering markets
and such like... which latter realization has sobered me to the realities
of my *own* poetry...

just a way to begin laying out the field, like i say... not so much on the
basis of aesthetics though, perhaps more in terms of power centers (in
which case zone four represents a sort of dispersion of power)... but
liking it or no may well have to do with how institutionally oriented one
wants to be...

best,

my parents apparently thought
my first name--christopher--unusual,
based on queries to friends & acquaintances.
["do you know any--?" "no, no"]. but
there were no less than 5 "chris"s in my
preschool class. so much for the
reliability of statistical/survey data.

considered changing my name, but then thought why bother. the
new name would still have the same (in-/convenient) limiting effect.
up to now I've assumed, Miekal, that was the impetus behind
the amount of play you seem to do with your own names. but
then again maybe not.

I have occasionally received mail & telephone solicitation for
alex sander--dont ask me where that one came from.

first to answer your question Mark, Id put into experimental anything
that didnt have a category of its own, visual/verbal, sound poetry or
text/sound, performance poetry, text installation, computer & virtual
language environments, bookart, collaborative,  poetry as life (for
instance one of the few poems Ive written in the last 5 years is a sign
hanging over our dairy goat gateway that says "goats dreaming"....), &
certainly the text creations of outsider artists as adolphi wolfi &
howard finster deserve a place in the geneology of the text.

as for the category "language" poetry, Ive never been comfortable with a
notion that someone who questions the many contexts of the language of
our time as being that separate from the spirit of poetry in general,
even most mainstream poets have been known to burst out in florescences
of "language"...is pound a language poet, is lewis carroll a language
poet, why do these distinctions have to exist to perpetrate a critical
nomenclature of pigeon holes & dusty compartments?


so maybe my point isnt to question all the categories that have been
carved out but to wonder out loud if all of us bright, creative, fuzzy
people cant continuously invent ways to interact with the corpus of
literature that defy, detourne, confuse & interbreed the will to
commodify genre consciousness.


miekal

who has written "language poetry" since 1976 & has never once been
included in a "language" anthology....because its in who ya know... that
these machines of text posterity are calculated.

        Despite a recent thread--no mention as yet of Visual Poetry and
Sound Poetry--certainly a vast field of work all too often relegated
beyond the back of the beyond . . . though world wide thousands of
practitioners.
        Paul Metcalf often points out--as do his reviewers and
interviewers--that his work does not fall into a category--and hence is
difficult not only to "market"--but to gain attention for his work from
critics hidebound by categories.  (Paul frequently notes his work being
found in travel sections.) He does note that he chose this path.
        It's an interesting paradox:  to want one's name to be
unique--and at same time to be recognized as part of a group.
        In tagging and some aspects of visual and mail art--there may be
a distinctive signature--yet by whom it is made--is often enough known to
but a very few.

actually C, Lyx & I both actively cultivate very different parts of our
personality as vital wholes, some people would call it life as art as
life, regardless I prefer multiple personalities over issues of psych

other late 20th century interventions into the inner life of humans

Jews name their kids for dead people, but there's some lattitude because of
translation. Hebrew or Yiddish names tend to be identical with that of the
deceased, but there's some slide when it comes into English. So I was named
for my cousin Maurice who died as a baby the year before I was born. It
became Mark because that was the fad name during the 2nd world war and my
parents had not yet lost their sanity and given me a furrin name in those
conservative, assimilationist times. By 1948, however, they had gone over
the edge: they announced that my brother-to-be was to be named Sandor after
my Hungarian grandfather. I brought to bear all of my 4 years of Brooklyn
street-smarts and convinced them that Steven would be more appropriate. The
reasoning was something to the effect that he'd be teased and taunted unto
insensibility. The hidden agenda was that I'd be getting a lot of black eyes
defending the little bugger, whose arrival I wasn't completely resigned to
in any case. So Steven it was.
I rarely think about my name. It became an issue in childhood only because
it was hard to make into a nickname, and at one point having a nickname was
a big deal. My grandfather, however (the one who was alive), got around this
by using my Hebrew name in an exaggeratedly Yiddish pronunciation, so that
it came out Moishiyizzik--Moses Isaac to the uninitiated.
It occurs to me now that as Jews we carry secret names, like some tribal
peoples who have a "real" name that only the individual and the shaman know.
To know the name, they think, is to control its bearer. Maybe for Jews our
secret names are supposed to carry the spirit of the dead. In fact, I only
know of Maurice because my aunt, who drank a bit, told me about him once
when she was in her cups.

     Is the last movie mentioned a slightly diffrent translation of the
Antonioni I saw, "The Passanger", starring no less than Jack Nickelson?
     Whoever mentioned "above" in the list that the problem with "Lone Star"
is the neatly sewn-up endings(I kind of agree)--"the Passanger" does not
suffer from this! I don't remember all that goes on in it but I remember
being delighted by the ending--a "trick" similar to the ending of "Blow Up"
but IMO much more powerful in an exestential grandlytragic sort of way.
     For "The Sheltering Sky" (film version), which I largely disliked, I
would substitue "Blue Sky," which has a little desert in it.

>A truly bad film (violence as porn) ...

     I have heard on the radio three times this morning an advertisement for
a newly released film (by "Sony Classics" I believe) about none other than
Robert Howard, "inventor of Conan" and "the greatest pulp writer of all
time" (the ad says that latter quote twice in 20 seconds).
     I'm not usually one for nostalgia, but when I get it its like the flu
and won't go away. All morning I have seen in my mind's eye not any
particular scenes from those paperbacks (though the crucifixation of Conan
was really good) but the photo on the inside back cover. Bob Howard, balding
with a drinking belly, standing barefoot on gray grass, holding a knife (a
dagger) and a gun. That image terrified and fascinated me much of my teenage
years. I wanted to be a writer--but not like that--he looked so
depressed!--and the caption underneath ends with his suicide--but a little
like that.

     What does the list think of Robert Howard?
     Of pulp?

what i've liked about ER and NYPD Blue is their unresolved issues and questions,

then went to it the other night after ER.  Blech!  it WAS one of the newer

Tyler Moore (which got me through childhood in a small midwestern town).
DID watch carol burnett a while ago, and it was still good...

Isn't there something about proper names and secret names in Of Grammatology?
I think the big D was unravelling something Levi-Strauss was doing with tribal
names in Tristes Tropiques...the circulation of names and the presence of the
anthropologist...the Other setting in motion the dispersal of names...authority
and policing and all that.

Of course the final authority on the business of names is Lewis Carroll aka
Humpty Dumpty, alias... what is he called?  No, what's his name?  I mean, who's
on first?

I dream of an anthology with no names...found as yet only in the Library of
Babel...

Sure: though it seems to me that the (falsely named) new formalism is do
dead and tiny that it hardly qualifies as a zone: and having myself
graduated from the Brown University MFA program in poetry it seems to me
that the distinction between writing programs (aren't I sending this to
Buffalo) and language poetry is fast becoming hard to assume: in other
words, Brown is a writing program profoundly engaged with language poetry:
other programs are as well and more and more are, it seems, likely to.  I
mention this not to dispute anything Joe says below only to suggest that
if we are interested in using zones as a descriptive term rather than
schools we better think of them as very liquid.

I haven't come across any other Tom Beard's - the name doesn't seem to be
particularly common. I'm adopted, too, so I'm not sure what I might have
been called - although my birth father was Dutch, so it would probably have
been even more uncommon.

I have noticed that my name kept me for some time from experimenting with
facial hair. My father had a beard for a while, and the jokes were truly
attrocious. Having had a goatee for about a year now (and I hate the whole
grunge/Gen X thing - I was inspired more by the 2nd series of Black Adder),
whenever anyone has difficulty spelling my name, I point at my chin and say
"mnemonic device".

One would think that my name would be easy enough to spell, but people
often write it down as "Baird". This is a more common name, but the main
reason seems to be that some NZers pronounce "air" as "ear".

No, I haven't seriously thought about changing my name, although I always
use "TRB" for my initials (the reason for which will be left as an exercise
for the reader).

If bookstores have categories within poetry, who'll decide who goes where?
St Mark's shunted my YOU-The City around the store so that nobody could
ever find it and then didn't restock on the basis that nobody looked for
it.  Was someone watching?

People who are in substantial agreement about the other arts often disagree
violently about films. The Sheltering Sky, for instance, is right near the
top of my list for all-time worst (I usually like to look at Debra Winger,
but in this case I found myself groaning, "Debbie, put your clothes on," so
even that minor satisfaction did nothing for me), and I could have ju
justified that opinion in great detail before memory decay set in. But I'm
aware that Ron or another of its admirers could probably be just as
detailedly convincing on the other side.
Why this peculiar phenomenon? My guess--it's only that--is that the
suggestive associative nature of film is in some way like the way we record
strong visual and motion memories (dreams tend to have a filmic structure,
full of bold cross-cutting and changes of local), and a particular image or
gesture may resonate so powerfully for me that I surrender to an otherwise
horrendous or manipulative film.
So if we all dreamed the same we'd all hate the sheltering sky. QED.

this is Elizabeth Was here making my first (official?) appearance on
this list, hopefully more will follow, (altho i'm admittedly especially
& morely excited about the visual poetry list). i'd like to correct
Miekal's spelling of (one of) my names, it's Elixir Aveshya.  At first
this ws going to be a private erotic name known & circulated only
amongst my closest of friends.  after having used it as author of my
first erotic short story "Victoria & Melampus", it looked so good in
print & sounded so much like a 15th century alchemical erotic
androgynous philosopher erudite that've become fond of it in print.
however, in spoken form it sounds too formal & pretentious, so i don't
like introducing myself as such.  as such i shortened it at first to
"Lix".  i'd tell people, just change the "z" to an "x" to get my new
name.  it tickled my long and equal fascination with "z"'s & "x"'s, as
well as my fascination with a young man whose last name is "Nix".  but
then i'd been referring to him with a "y" as in Nyx, the goddess of
night (with occasional added reference to the water sprites known as
"nixies" which in turn reminds one of the more earth-based sprites known
as "pixies").  well then this same young man went ahead & printed my
name on a roster of performers for an event he co-sponsored as simply,
"Lyx".  Again i was tickled in new places & now finally almost 2 years
after only sort of changing my name i have finally settled on telling
people my name is "Lyx". (except in cases such as the first sentence of
this here note, where i introduce my old name, so those on the list who
have heard of me have something to recognize)  Problem:  now everyone
thinks I am Lyx Was.  Well Lyx Was i am not,  I hate the sound of it,
yuch.  Lyx Aveshya doesn't work either.  I am in the process of
considering "Lyx Ish"  although this might entail putting more than one
space between the first & last name:  Lyx    Ish.     thus i will have
gone from a past tense noun to an adjectivial ending.  i like its
jewishness, having been born into a jewish family. give me some
feedback.  what more secrets shall i tell the lot of you?  ah, no more,
there are personas of mine i'm afraid you'll never appelle.  till next
time, Liz Was,  I mean. . . .

Dear David Bromige: WHAT academic doors have I darkened?
Do you know something (about this) I don't? They (the doors) may be locked
for the time being, and I am trying to cast myself into a role different than
the one who is begging to be let in (and hence the off-again on-again romance
with a posture of indifference), but is this a darkening?
(answer: yes, virginia, there is a santa claus)....
well, i currently teaching COMPOSITION again
(and asked my students to write:
"If the LAND (that has been raped and pillaged) could speak, what would it
say?"----
but ENGLISH as a "field" is really bizarre.....
The "coalition" it makes between "composition" and "literature" should
perhaps be BROKEN down.....
being that poetry, etc. for me has less in common with
comp. than with other non-ENGLISH things
(it isn't academia per se that's the problem, but "package deals") and
teaching literature is more like teaching
"decomposition" (which I long for.....even if it still pays adjunct). darkly,
chris

Subject:      Re: poetry "schools"

        What about them radical mavericks?      A lot of the writers I like most--
Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Arthur Sze, Phillip Foss, James Thomas Stevens,
Michael Palmer, C. D. Wright, William Bronk, Cole Swensen, Fanny Howe, Kamau
Brathwaite, Nate Mackey, John Taggart, Gustaf Sobin, Peter Cole-- fall
outside of "schools."  Is Ann Lauterbach's new work LANGUAGE poetry or New
York School?  Barbara Guest was a New York School poet, but what is she now?
 The notion of schools seems to me clubby and limiting.
        At the same time, of course, I too want to see more representation in
bookstores.  Representation comes through distribution.  I think what is most
needed is an effective distribution network, something the NEA and the CCLM,
if lobbied, might initiate together.
        Even the notion of supporting publishing houses seems less constrictive than
that of supporting "schools." New Directions, Stone Bridge, Firebrand, Lost
Roads, Burning Deck, Talisman House publish a range of writers and
aesthetics.  Presses like Sun and Moon or Kelsey Street, associated with
schools of writing, also publish important books that fit into no predefined
niche.  It's the ones without handles would be lost in your scheme.

I can't vouch for the truth of what follows, but I did read it somewhere
once upon a time. It seems that until the mid-nineteenth century there were
no family names in Norway--everyone was Lief Ericsson or Eric Liefsson or
Jon Jonson (sorry about the spelling). The Norwegian powers that be declared
that everyone had to choose a last name--and everyone did (I think it was
male heads of households who decided)--they chose the names they already
went by. So there were an awful lot of Jonsons and Ericssons and Olsons.
Sort of like the mythical country in WC Fields' Million Diollar Legs, where
all the men are named George and all the women are named Angela.
Some years ago I received an offer of a copy of the Weiss family history.
The publisher claimed that Weiss was a rare and aristocratic name. There are
four pages of Weiss's in the Manhattan phonebook. And as for aristocrats,
the pub must have known that most US Weiss's are eastern european Jews (my
understanding is that Weiss is a mostly Christian name in Germany and mostly
Jewish in Austria and its former dependencies). She offered to send a copy
of our heraldic shield along with the book. My guess is that there are
Jewish families with copies of this document hanging over the fireplace,
unaware that it was lifted from some minor Junker noble whose family motto,
if translated from Latin or Gothic, probably means: Who'd you call Jewish?

While at Maria Professorina's house amid her massive library (including
piles of books by many people on this list) I came a cross a hot little
erotic collaboration between Bob Harrison & Dodie Bellamy.  Titillating
at least, Id like to see if there was a way of getting ahold of it,
(title & publisher have slipped my mind, but Ive retained some of the
graphic text, no surprise!).  In particular Id like to see if I could
trade a copy of Lyx's & my 1982 collaboration EROTIC LOGIC, which is
similar in spirit tho perhaps more languagey.

have safe eroticatalia,

I caught the PBS show on DuBois.  It was in 4 parts, and
conceived/produced/overseen by Bambara; however each part was written and
narrated by a different person.  The last part was by Baraka, and it dealt
with DuBois's radicalism in the face of McCarthy and the Cold War.  It was
excellent:  clear, piercing, exceedingly moving.  At the end of the credits
was an IMO for Bambara, which was the first I'd heard of it as well.

for no other reason than to jump in after a long absence:

dad named me linda after an old girlfriend, this bit of news
shared apparently for this first time in my parents' 30+ yr
marriage over thanksgiving dinner a few years ago

The v. stands for valerie -- mom's pick -- was my babush's name

my babush on the other side of my family is my nunna,
mary fudge as maidennames go -- was fruggi before they
got to immigration

my greatgreatgrandparents on my father's grandfather's side
were both love children & so orphans -- so
my last name anyway isn't my last name really

Esteemed Listserv Denizens --

Yesterday, I posted to you'all (SAasiaLit & Poetics lists)
information I'd received from another listserv regarding some alleged
current legisilation that could lead to new charges for internet use.

According to new info received today, that earlier message was a
mere hoax.  I'm a gullible guy.

Presuming this new info is in fact legit -- my humble apologies.

yours,
d.i.

p.s.: see the appended for details

p.p.s.:   I tried to take a look at the EFF homepage & see about
verifying the "mythical" character of the alleged FCC deal, but
frankly lost patience w/ the download.  (Maybe I'll look later.)

Anyone noticing the transparency of the net & web? ie, how all creative
problems  reduce almost instantly to the techne? This isn't a question
about the depth of work & the surface of presentation; more, I guess, it's
about doing away with the publisher, and how that throws design & formal
issues back to the writer.

It's number One.  Fall 1988 avail. for $5 unless i bought up the last
one.  There's a great interview in there, somewhat of an epic at 11.5
pages,  somewhat related to epic inquiries, perhaps. There's a good
bit of autobio which is very interesting and entertaining, as one
would expect.  & Notley talks about line length and how you know
 when a poem is over, which is "well, you know when it's over when it's over."

is that how you know when an epic's over?

 A very interesting addendum to a very interesting parallel:

as recently as 7 months ago i lived in boston & heard tell that
the Grolier Poetry Bookshop's langpo section was the fastest
 moving in the store -- also, there was some crossover when
the # of copies allowed: i remember specifically that
 Michael Palmer was cross-sectioned. (sounds painful!)

& while i'm in the area let me express my sincere sense of
shame twds harvard sq for destroying the only
decent place to sit down at 3 am & get a laugh out of
the redline menu (basicly one item: bacondoublecheeseburger)
& talk to a bunch of people that'd you'd maybe see around and
never even think to see.

Dear Mr Bromige,

I am writing to you in your capacity as resident fashion consultant and
haberdasher to the poetics list.  I'll be in New York later this week (on
my way to Texas) & thought I'd go to hear Kathleen Fraser & Charles
Borkhuis read at the Ear on Saturday, but I'm unsure how to dress for the
occasion.

I mean, I'd hate to show up in my usual Seattle grunge attire only to find
that the NY scene has moved onto retro-Victorian-Beatnik clothing or some
such.

At the very least I need to know whether to wear my baseball cap with the
visor over my face or over my neck.  Do you have a long-range forecast for
this accessory that's good through next weekend?  I hope I'm not expected
to wear the visor to one side or the other at a jaunty angle.  I really
hate that.

Please advise (& don't let anyone know I've asked for you counsel in this
matter.  People like Bowering can be so cruel sometimes.)

From one basement to another, all the best,

Herb

Eliza-
I think you're right in identifying the source of the *feel* of
violence in a rape scene as deriving largely from the gaze of the camera,
i.e.,  a rape scene filmed from POV of the rapist or anyone looking over
the rapist's shoulder as opposed to POV of one who is raped.  Any view
outside that of the victim has the potential to be an exploitative and
oppressive  one,
and yes,  this could be considered a "male" gaze,  even if the rapist
were a woman (since historical male-domination of females has saturated
every level of society,  so
this gaze can be appropriated for a female character co-opted in  a male
structure or by a female director in same structure--has Penny Marshall
filmed a rape scene yet?).  Hollywood has a particularly dreadful record
of this kind of exploitation.  There is a particularly reprehensible
scene in the film "Strange Days"  where a rapist wears a device which
allows him to experience the emotions of whomever he hooks it up to.  He
proceeds to enter a woman's apartment,  sedate her with a taser,  rape
and strangle her while experienceing her own experience of this
vicariously.  The whole scene is shot from his perspective, and is
relentlessly,  nauseatingly vicious-- I think
you could even see the outline of his facemask around the edges of the
frame. In essence,  the viewer is forced to assume the viewpoint of
the rapist--to BECOME the rapist,  and
either to accept tacitly the act,  or,  short of leaving the movie,  fight
against this positioning,  which I did by looking away.  The scene is
completely unsympathetic to the woman and clearly pruriently sadistic in its
intention.  Isn't it great to know that Hollywood largely espouses the
oppression of women?  And here we thought things were beginning to
equalize somewhat between the sexes. The important thing is to be aware
that this kind of crap and attitude is STILL out there and to resist or
fight against it any way one can.

kaballah and such i was doing, and coz raymond was my dad's name, and we
werent on friendly terms at the time. dan raphael is a year and a month
older than dan dlugonski; his middle name is ambrose.

to explain to Poetics - why I send poems/texts to this list - and that
poetry is expensive.* I haven't been able to buy such (I am not working
towards definition here) for years (sometimes 2nd-hand); I stopped around
the time I found out I couldn't afford Susan Howe, who I read in Segue's
stockroom (or Roof's). Nor am I published by any poetics/literary press,
not having contacts (which is a matter of the social, something I fare
poorly at). So that here there is a loosening of literary institutions,
allowing a different/difficult form of dissemination. That there is no
forfeit on anyone's part in the reading/writing/deleting.

Which also depends on balance, the swerve of it. A sensitivity. And to the
current state of threading/weaving. So such writing is a flesh in the pan,
not stance of noise/introjection, an other's way of mistressing theory.
Which is why I felt compelled

*we should think of this, the _economics_ of reading; nothing is free,
nothing, in my world.

Groundwater pools in the valley separating the ridge
where Daniel Chester French "rests" from the rocky hill holding the rest
of Hawthorne, the Thoreau family, Emerson and the Alcotts.
William Ellery Channing has a newer headstone than the rest,
but we forget who he is (was). The ice in that valley is thick enough to skate

That would be disrespectful. And we have no skates with us.

Sorry to join this discussion late -- just got my e-mail back after a
three-day technical meltdown and a trip out of town.

I think it was Isaiah Berlin who said that the world was composed of two
two kinds of people: those who divide the world into two kinds of
people, and those who don't.  I propose a division of poetic schools
along the same grounds -- we could divide poets into those who divide
poetry into schools and those who don't.  I suspect the latter group
would contain most of the poets I find most interesting.

Around the same time I received word that my old college mate Essex
Hemphill, who published one of my first sorry poems in his journal
_Nethula_, had died of AIDS -- Not long afterward I was told by a

passed away -- When I told him Essex was from DC, he said that he must
have made the mistake because he'd seen Essex in a film by Isaac Julien
-- but of course the film he had in mind was made by Marlon Riggs -- Hard
to keep those Anglo-Afro-American-Gay-Writer-Filmpeople straight, eh?

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I know the original impetus for this is some time ago now, but I noticed
some posts several weeks back were arguing that any truly effective poetry
in the present moment would transcend the supposed "limits" of a poetry
oriented to the page by 1) involving other media 2) becoming more
performative, and thus more "entertaining" to an audience who is tired of
watching poets flip pages and mumble through their readings. There's
really crucial work being done in multi-media work and performance art,
many by people on this list (Miekal And may not be in any language poetry
anthology, but anyone at the Writing From The New Coast conference in
Buffalo 1993 has never forgotten Miekal's performance/visual art/ poetry,
as just one for instance). But I do think, however, that statements
to the effect that poetry somehow MUST mutate in some direction or other
actually end up doing a disservice to the range of work that's actually
happening.

        It is, I suppose, a fantasy to imagine a circumstance in which
poets might be taken by more than a small group of people as individuals
who have GOOD REASONS FOR DOING THE THINGS THEY'RE DOING--but obviously,
all sorts of poetry arises from intellectual and other kinds of notions
that can be found suspect. Nonetheless, when I hear statements to
the effect that "poetry must become this and that in order to remain
viable in a culture of this or that kind, etc" I can't avoid thinking of
the ways in which exploration in poetry both remains under the thumb of
this kind of pronouncement, but also the ways in which poetry refutes such
judgements, renders them often just so much table-pounding. I'm afraid
that I think that all such statements as "only this kind of work will be
legitimate in the future" simply CAN'T be true--the value of making such
statements seems often little more that the desire to assert that one's
own questions are the ones that matter, unless you can imagine someone
saying that poetry must move in a direction that they themselves are not
practicing. The point I'm trying to make, I think, is that the creative
mind can continue to work in all sorts of mediums, as long as
self-awareness remains about the historical and material conditions of
those mediums. Is there anyone who REALLY imagines that there will be a
point in time when no creative poets think of the page as a usable medium.
Is it not more likely that the moment a whole culture determined that a
page had no value, one poet or maybe even more would begin using the page
again?

        Obviously, the performance/visual aspects of poetry enable much
variety of artistic practice, and much opportunity for "hybrid" or other
kinds of non-singular media forms. But I think it's important that this
complexity should NOT be reduced to the idea that poetry somehow needs to
be more ENTERTAINING. I find poetry entertaining often, sometimes even
poetry I don't like that much, but THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF ENTERTAINMENT IN
CONTEMPORARY CULTURE, and the hegemony of the "entertainment industry" is
playing a major role in the contemporary disenfranchisement of broad areas
of human communities. Will the person going to a poetry reading looking to
be entertained be DISAPPOINTED? In some cases I'd like to say "let's hope
so--the poetry wasn't written to entertain." I don't mean that a poetry
reading should be BORING--I mean that values other than entertainment are
at stake, and the person at a poetry reading who's disappointed because
they're not entertained is, perhaps unintentionally, imposing the values
of capitalist entertainment hegemony on an art form that does not intend
to be restrained by those values.

        The idea that poetry "must move in this or that direction"
certainly bears a great deal of responsibility for the modern notion of
the poetry school, and "schools" of poetry are by no means a negative
phenomena, since they can allow groups of similarly interested writers to
form networks and communities that enable their writing to reach others in
ways it otherwise wouldn't. The conviction that poetry "must"
move a certain way can often be an incredibly generative basis
for the creation of new work. "Schools" have their negative aspects
also--the inevitable exclusion of certain "marginal" figures, however
determined, being one of the most obvious, as well as the tendency to
dismiss other "schools" of work without a full examination of their
concerns. My own sense is that some "schools" do need to be at least
critiqued, if not dismissed--I DO have a problem with neo-formalism in a
way that Steven Marks perhaps does not. I agree with Joe Amato, though,
that the writer who claims to be a "free player" (I'm not a member of
anything but my own authentic practice!) probably is not recognizing the
way group interaction has helped form his or her aesthetic. But the
problem, again, of telling poets what they MUST do, or of dictating what
poetry MUST be, is that poets seldom do what others tell them they must,
and almost always what their own sense of their work tells them they
"must," if one could put it that way.

ANNOUNCEMENT:

Ruthless Grip Art Project (1508 U Street, NW, Washington DC) will
be the site of a book party and reading on March 8, 1997 at 7:30
PM, to celebrate the publication of Tim Dlugos' Powerless:
Selected Poems 1973-1990 (London and New York: High Risk Press,
1996, 115 p.). Powerless was edited by David Trinidad and
introduced by Dennis Cooper, two poets who acknowledge the
influence of Dlugos' work and life on their own writing/lives and
on that of a wide variety of writers and artists across the
country. The poems in the collection are arranged chronologically
in three sections: work published while he was alive (some of
which was written while he lived in Washington, DC), poems from
Strong Place (published in New York in 1992 by Amethyst Press,
which ceased publishing/distributing books soon thereafter), and
the manuscript he compiled shortly before his death from AIDS in
1990. This last section includes the poem "G-9", named for the
wing devoted to caring for people with AIDS at St. Luke's -
Roosevelt Hospital in New York City.  A copy of "G-9" has been
"enshrined" at that hospital as a special memorial, and has been
anthologized widely. Dlugos, who for a time lived at a Christian
Brother novitiate near Philadelphia, was studying to become an
Episcopalian priest at the time of his death. As David Lehman
said in a review of Powerless published in the Washington Post
Book World last December, "[Dlugos] wrote with heartbreaking
grace about his illness and impending death."  This grace was the
grounding of Tim's life as a whole, what Cooper calls in the
introduction "his ravenous fascination with the innumerable ways
in which grace could be represented through artfulness."

The evening will feature a reading of Dlugos' work by local poets
and writers including Bernard Welt, Beth Joselow, Richard McCann,
P. Inman, and Lynne Dreyer.  Copies of Powerless will be
available for purchase (checks preferred).  There is no admission
fee.

Subject:      Rasula and poetry zones
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Pardon the lengthy description of my own work.  I post this here because it
is relevant to the discussion, and also because I'd like to hear from folks
who object to my account, so as to strengthen it. So here goes:

Although I find Rasula's account of the four "zones" of poetry compelling,
Joseph Lease and Forrest Gander rightly point to problems with zones as an
operative category.  Assigning particular poets to one or another zone is
only one of these problems.  There are always exceptions, such as Lauterbach
and Gander himself, and the New Formalism seems, as Lease pointed out, a
blip on the poetic horizon, fast becoming (if it hasn't already become)
insignificant.

Rasula has his finger on something important, however.  In my own
work-in-progress on the poetic field (for an abstract, see
"http://www.duke.edu/~kellogg/sri.html"), I conceive these zones as
abstractions, POLES OF VALUE within the contemporary construction of poetic
practice.  (This work is obviously indebted to Pierre Bourdieu in ways that
I don't have time to explain right now.)  What Rasula identifies as the MFA
school corresponds more or less to a poetry predicated on uncomplicated
representations of Self.  Against this obviously is the poetry of social
conflict, community building, identity politics, etc.  Call the struggle
between these two poles the horizontal (social) axis of the poetic field.
Appeal to one or another of these sources of value has little to do with
form as such.  What I call the formal, or "vertical" axis of the poetic
field comprises both NF and LP, but without naming them.  While the New
Formalism is fading fast, the appeal to "tradition" still operates within a
lot of contemporary poetry, even language poetry as it becomes canonically
interesting.  (I am speaking sociologically; I don't mean "interesting" as
an evaluative comment.) Against the appeal to "tradition" one could place an
appeal to "innovation."  So that the contemporary poetic field looks more or
less like this:

                         TRADITION
          ---------------------------------------
          |                                     |
          |                                     |
     SELF |          [the poetic field]         |  COMMUNITY
          |                                     |
          |                                     |
          ---------------------------------------
                         INNOVATION


It seems to me that this kind of a model is more flexible than a model which
operates in terms of "zones" or "schools."  As New Formalism fades, the
appeal to tradition is still operative.  As language poetry becomes (to
paraphrase Ron Silliman) more of a moment than a movement, other
possibilities begin to inhabit the arena close to innovation.  Obviously
much language poetry would still be placed close to the "innovation" pole,
but individual poets' work could be read at various places within the field.
Moreover, poets might _move_, or be moved, as the vicissitudes of
canonization affect perception and reading.  (Charles Bernstein's work seems
a lot more "traditional" now -- what with various historical accounts of
language poetry by Beach, Perelman, etc., and what with the recovery of
Stein and Zukofsky, and _The Tennis Court Oath_ for a broader audience in
various critical accounts -- than he did in, say, 1980.  Also, Bernstein's
own criticism has helped create the traditional context for his work.)  One
could also place individual poems, "schools" (Iowa, Brown, Buffalo), and
institutions at various points within the field.

Well, whaddaya think?  Does this account via poles of value escape some of
the problematics of the zone/school?

I agree whole-heartedly with miekal here. I also find the term
"linguistically innovative" rather insulting to any poet who doesn't
identify with that movement - to me, any good (loaded word) lyric poem is
linguistically innovative. Is Bill Manhire "linguistically innovative"? How
about Edwin Morgan, Phyllis Webb or Geoffrey Hill? To me, they all use
language in ways that are often surprising, dislocating and/or playful, but
I doubt that they'd align themselves with langpo.

I guess I prefer Jackson Mac Low's term, "perceiver centred" (or "reader
centred" for written arts) - an acknowledgement of the fact that meaning is
created in the act of perception/reading - works that provide the
perceiver/reader with fertile ground for meaning creation. Of course, one
could take this to mean that there are no reader-centred writers, only
reader-centred readers - it doesn't matter whether the author has read
Derrida or Olson; one could read Baxter in the same way that one might read
a language poet. How much fun that might be is a different question.

That phrase "fertile ground" is crucial, of course. What makes one slab of
language any more "fertile" than another? That of course depends upon the
reader, and so one has to make assumptions (with the inevitable ideological
and cultural bias that they entail) about the reader(s). I'm quite happy to
do that (although I like to think that I question my assumptions in the
process) if it is going to result in a more "fertile" piece of writing.

That may be why I'm still attracted to lyric poetry, albeit a lyric poetry
that's more influenced by Oppen, Creeley, Wedde, Hawken and Neidecker (?sp)
than by Keats or whoever. For me, the "lyre" that the words play to
accompany their meanings, the dance of signifier and signified, the
hesitations of line breaks and the webs of connotations all provide fertile
ground for linguistic innovation.

common sense is a collective noun, like religion: there is not just one

Dear POETICS folks,

In case anyone's interested in how the avant-garde is faring around the
political Web, there's an article on Gertrude Stein as a Republican in
the latest issue of SLATE, Bill Gates's vanity press. Slate is at
"http://www.slate.com/".

$8. "Destiny is not inscribed in an infrastructure."

5. _Little Men_ by Kevin Killian, Hard Press, $12. "Kevin Killian writes like

Bravo, Mark.  The "techne", as Wendy called it, is changing all the time,
but techne is not the thing.  I am reminded of Proust's musings (or his
character's) at the end of _Recherche du Temps_ (c'mon folks, you can
read that far too - follow me!).  We are all immersed in a much deeper
"techne" - Time itself and the desolations/voids/returns that Time brings.
Proust's narrator declares that he finds his writerly vocation and the
creation of his gigantic Oeuvre in a particular effect of time: the
sudden, unsought-for juxtaposition of an ordinary present sensation
with a SIMILAR sensation (not the same, but similar, echoing) from the
ancient past, which brings memory to life & restores the actual
"feel" of time & existence.  And that this perception is an aesthetic
phenomenon: it's not ordinary life now or then, but the conjunction of
the 2, a new amalgam; which he links overtly both to the workings
of metaphor in poetry and to the workings of the thinking mind in general
(finding similarities between disparate things).  He talks about the
aesthetes or "artists in embryo" as those who overvalue the art work
per se and remain on the surface of OTHER's work, rather than immersing
themselves in the realities of their own experience & making something
new and fruitful.

Mark--
good comments there, on the whole, & thoughtful, tho I'm put off by a
curious strain of neo-puritanism implicit in your dismissal of
"entertainment" value in poetry readings--yes, there is plenty of
entertainment out there wherever one turns, but I'm not convinced a human
impulse to be entertained is necessarily a product of capitalism (tho
certainly our culture's saturation in entertainment has something to do
with late capitalism).  How would you react were one to replace the word
"entertainment" in your post with the word "pleasure"?  I guess I'm just
registering suspicion that we seem to be rejecting the fun half of
Horace's pleasure & instruction.
Best,
Mark

i've got to agree with mark wallace's last post on must-ing in poetry...

the problem, or controversy, stems from those who are feeling persistently
neglected in specific circles... and what to do about such neglect,
assuming for a moment that it's *real*...

which goes to the question of "schools" of poetry... i think joseph lease
is quite correct in pointing to the fluidity of zones... marketing zones,
not aesthetic zones -- as wendy battin indicates... but we all know,
right?, how distribution, publication, marketing can back-pressure
aesthetics...  and in some crucial aspects, these zones are not esp.
fluid...

to take but one example:  until andrew levy's appearance here at iit, where
i teach, in 1992 (which coincided with my arrival as well), no undergrad.
at iit had been exposed to much if anything in the way of contemporary
poetry for a good long time... certainly nothing that would constitute
zones 3 or 4 of rasula's analysis, and certainly nothing from these zones
could even have seeped in accidentally, not to say, programmatically,
things here were that stuffy... and things at K-12 are undoubtedly
stuffier... of course we don't have any english majors here at iit any
longer (had about a half-dozen then maybe)... but the point is that i don't
gauge the pertinence of "schools" with whether they correspond to mfa
programs  -- that is, "schools of poetry" do not necessarily correlate with
"grad. schools of poetry" (many of which i suspect are gradually getting
the picture, if only in retrospect, and many of which seem to me to be set
up to house perhaps two competing "camps," if that)... one would still have
to contend with the status of "craft" in creative writing classrooms in
general, and how this is supported by and supports most popularly renowned
writing and writing venues (and note that the upcoming u of denver
conference is constructed in a crucial way around this notion of "craft" --
i'll be speaking there to this question by addressing "craft" in somewhat
unorthodox terms)...

anyway... of course the aesthetic reality is much more diverse and messy
than ANY notion of  "zone" or "school" might suggest... but the problem --
if there's a problem here, and i think there is--- has primarily to do with
how zones and schools play out in the marketplace, in our institutions...
which, again, is why i make the case that, whatever the requisite autonomy
or solitude of a writer's art, once that art enters into the social world,
a somewhat different perspective is necessary to understand what's going on
in practical terms... that is, unless one is willing to hallucinate about
the social sphere, i think one MUST accept this---ergo something like the
paradox that mark unpacks, but here a function of critical position as
opposed to aesthetic production... it may be that this is the proviso
lurking in the difference between such practices...

best,

joe

I largely agree, but have to wonder whether it is perhaps a good thing that
'we' as audience had to turn away. At least for once we were shocked and
horrified by a cinema rape.

And Strange Days, one of the few by a woman.

I'll throw this into the mix--it's a quote from Matthew Sweney, who's been
working with Petr Mikes at Votobia Publishers in the Czech Republic:

"Poetry [in the C.R.] doesn't sell now because it's no longer
controversial. Everyone was writing and buying poetry before because it was
illegal, a sort of rebellious act, but now that Socialism is gone, poetry
has lost its attraction. People watch Schwarzenegger videos on their new
VCRs instead."

Hello Poets...
Can anyone help Damien Broderick in Australia with this query ?

I recently asked after the credentials of somebody I'm currently reviewing,
and got back this interesting reply:

`My doctorate is from LeSalle University in Mandeville, LA.  It is not a
conventional doctorate, and I did not take three years of my life to
attend a resident course of study.  LeSalle is an extension university
that is acredsited by the state of Lousiana.  My doctorate is in
Education Administration; my dissertation titled:  "The Theory of
Multiple Intelligences:  Understanding Diversity in Education."  I did
not simply buy my degree--believe it or not, I had to work for it.  I
apologize if I sould a bit synical, I don't mean to be.'

Alta Vista didn't help.  Anyone know if this is an arm of the Bob Jones
Center for Advanced Creation Studies or the Pizza Hut University, or is it a
rooly truly degree joint like all of us synical people went to?

Feel free to email me direct rather than bother the list any further...

Damien

This seems to be the FCC's reply to the current thread, via thier web-page:

<<Internet Access & Information Service Provider NOI

The NOI seeks comment on whether the FCC should, in addition to access
charge reform, consider actions relating to the implications of information
service and Internet access provider usage of the public switched network.
In particular, in light of concerns raised over congestion on the public
switched network, the
Commission seeks comment on how it can most effectively create incentives
for the deployment of services and facilities to allow more efficient
transport of data traffic to and from end users.

The Commission made no specific proposals, but tentatively concluded that
providers of information services (including Internet service providers)
should not be subject to the interstate access charges that local telephone
companies currently assess on long-distance carriers.

Just thought everyone wd like to know. It is tentively in the recycle
bin... the FCC will not charge service providers, this seems to mean that
service providers are exempt, meaning that we will prolly be exempt (I know
a few ppl working as service providers and they are just like us... they
just have a T1 or so...).

David, could you say what's "obvious" about this?  I'd have thought there
were other alternatives to "uncomplicated representations of Self"
(complicated ones? nonrepresentational ones?  zen observation?)  that
don't partake very directly of identity politics.

as would I. but all of this, of course, assumes that bookstores
*want* to represent the poetry that falls into whatever categories
you (anyone) choose(s)--something I'd like to believe but--. if poetry
sections are, as they are, increasingly small & usually written off as
a loss even when they focus on the writers showcased by 'mainstream'
literary publications, well--.

of course much of this has to do with us & our buying habits--a topic
that's been discussed here before.

it's a possibility that hadn't occurred to me, but it does seem
like it might be a worthwhile thing--to represent smaller presses
by turns rather than try to carve poetry into recognizable sections
[flank, head, buttocks]. after all, once the books are on the shelves
of most bookstores, theyre arranged alphabetically anyway.

"so maybe my point isnt to question all the categories that have been

commodify genre consciousness."

Miekal,  I'm curious to hear more about this.  I understand what you
propose here,  but wouldn't it work against the dissemination (through
major marketers,  at least) of work because of resistance to
genre-labelling that same marketers (and consumers?) demand? i.e,  would
grunge music be near as big if not for the commercialization and mass
identification/appeal of the term
"grunge" (I guess your investment in my example depends on your
opinion as to
the importance & enriching of the world by grunge music- grunge-enriched?
is that a soil type?)  Then again,  maybe this wouldn't have been a bad
thing.  It
would have saved us from all the rip-off bands and allowed the
true/original music to
continue without being exploited.  But then again,  if something's good,
shouldn't it (deserve to) be exposed to as many people as possible?  I
really like
your idea in theory,  Miekal,  but it seems to get murky when you apply to
real (market) situation. Maybe I've become too jaded to believe that
something as huge as the literary corpus can be detourned or
interbreeded.  Why do we have to play with them anyway?  Ideally,  we'd
all be selfless poets who could be happy enriching the lives of our
immediate
community-those we know and care about, our town/city- and this
interbreeding and
networking would eventually intervine its way through the whole world--
or would it?--spreading the fruits of our hard work and hard-won
humanity to people of all plces and cultures?  is that what we want anyway?
would the whole world be better or not without the mass production of
Frost,  and,  hence,  Frost? Do we have to sacrifice global
communing/ication of poetry/culture for a closely networked community of
readers and creators?  What does the poet want as opposed to what the
market wants and should the poet care?  I've reached the end of my
moebius trip...Maybe Charles Bernstein could step in and reiterate his
idea in_a poetics_ about poetic communities learning how to communicate
amongst
themselves before they begin communicating interculturally? (The computer
seems to play into this somehow...)

This is a little longer than most of these announcements run, but I thought
the non-poetic content might need some context.  Hope to see some of you at
the CD release parties:

Announcing the release of the first CD on my new label Periplum, Suspended
Music - Deep Listening Band & Long String Instrument, presenting first
recordings of  new music for these combined ensembles, composed by Pauline
Oliveros and Ellen Fullman.

Some of you may be familiar with Deep Listening Band (a collaborative
ensemble with Pauline Oliveros, Stuart Dempster, and David Gamper) from
their recordings made in unusual acoustic spaces, including a cistern on
the Olympic Peninsula with 45 seconds of natural reverberation.  Some of
you may be familiar with other, earlier projects by Oliveros and/or
Dempster, who have a long history of new music activities together and
separately.

Fewer folks are probably familiar with Ellen Fullman and her Long String
Instrument. Since the mid-1980s, Fullman has been refining this instrument
and composing music for it.  The current incarnation of the instrument is a
little less than 100 feet long, with several courses of piano wire (between
60-80 strings in all) strung about waist-high.  It's played by walking
along the strings and rubbing them longitudinally, rather than plucking or
bowing the strings across their length. It sounds great, and not like
anything you've ever heard before.

I'm making a special introductory offer to members of this e-mail
discussion list: until March 1st, the semi-official release date of
Suspended Music, you can order the CD for US$15 including tax & shipping
from:

Periplum
P O Box 95678
Seattle, WA  98145

It'll be about $16-17 in stores (& it will be in stores eventually, now
that the disc is in hand, I'm spending the next month or so trying to find
distribution.  There's nothing like SPD for new music, so this is a real
adventure).

E-mail responses are welcome, but PLEASE respond back channel, rather than
to the whole list.

The CD will also be available on line from Deep Listening Catalog:

<http://www.deeplistening.org/dlc>

(They have other recordings, scores, etc. available there as well.)


&, hey, if you want to help celebrate the release of the CD, choose from
one of these four new release parties:

February 22, 1997  4-7 pm

The Candy Factory
1513 Manor Road

Dear C.

     What I'm suggesting is a sort of e-mail exquisite corpse. I've seen as
I expect you have those ones some websites have tried to initiate, and they
are IMO by and large godawful. They operate like normal e-corpses, with each
person adding on to what was. But I would suggest that this wordprocessing
technology is geared to delete, not add, and so that aspect of the
technology should be employed as well: namely, the proper e-corpse would
involve each person both adding text and deleting the pre-existent text. We
would have to develop a technique by which a certain portion of the
"message" could be changed everytime, but some ever-growing part of it could
not be changed. My reasoning for this being that if changes could always be
made to the entire text, then the movement toward a settled and monologic
voice would be more likely than if, as in the paper corpses, some part had
to be left untouched every time.
     I just sent you a rewriting of your message to poetics using my new
technique (new for me) that works only on a computer: working quickly
through a piece of text with the cursor, cutting and pasting, but never
adding and only occasionally deleting. ( I deleting too much in my last
one.) I originally tried this on paper a couple years ago by cutting up
articles from NY times stories and than rearranging them. I like working
with an obviously limited vocabularly since we all do anyway.

     I still have not finished your long and eloquent messages to me. I am
impressed with your research. I will send some responses when I can. Do you
want me to send you that paperback book thing?

     I just recieved an e-mail from Jenny M. She is a full professor at the
city college she was working at before and makes an annual salary and seems
fairly committed for the time being and quite happy. She is continually
biking and preparing for the next AIDS ride next summer. Perhaps you knew
all this!

     love,

     M (onday)

Charles/Loss, is it time to raise the bridge? Or lower the bridge? What's
the limit to the 21st Century? What's the price of a Buffalo nickel?

Re:

"is that how you know when an epic's over?"

If an epic is a poem including history, then it's only over

(let alone "Do not move / let the wind speak / that is paradise")

when history is

and that ain't now, Francis

Has anyone read (by the way) Harold Bloom's new book _Omens of Millenium_?
I found it a pretty good read, some valuable information on gnosticism,
which isn't exactly "spirit possession," but close.

Herb Levy (often seen on 5th and Seneca in Seattle in jodhpurs) reminded me
of a trip I took to NYC in 1970, to hear Pharoah Sanders at Slugs's Bar. I
thought I would just wear my regular clothes, so I wd appear hip and not
get mugged. So I wore

a toque (Canadian for knitted cap)
a shirt made of some viscous material in green and black stripes
a maroon sweater knitted by my mother
a serge cape once worn by a City Of Westminster police constable
yellow jeans
logging boots
big knitted red socks
electricians gloves (you know, stripes of grey, red and blue
long stringy hair
a moustache
dark glasses
a cheapo cigar with a plastic tip


I didnt get mugged. Not even an offer. Not even in front of Peace Eye Books.

Hullot-Kentor, U Minnesota, $39.95.
Woop, de it is. "That old and silly cabaret phrase, 'Love, it's so =
erotic'
provokes the variation: 'Art, it's so aesthetic': this is to be taken =

deep seriousness as a momento of what has been repressed by its =
consumption."

some
pockets of what could be called community, such a social phenomenon is
extremely limited. As with public space it must be asked: What =
community!?"

Series,
$8. "Destiny is not inscribed in an infrastructure."

5. _Little Men_ by Kevin Killian, Hard Press, $12. "Kevin Killian writes =

Gluck

Lynn
Nielsen, Cambridge, $18.95.
"Aldon Nielsen's knowledgeable, pathbreaking study brings long overdue

Subject:      Zones v. Zoos
Comments: cc: rsillima@NS.tssc.com

David,

I'm a sufficiently unreconstructed structuralist to find your box below
enormously elegant and lovely to think about (and I shall for some
while to come, actually), but in some ways I think it replicates the
same sort of problem I find with Rasula's concept of Zones, which is a
spatialized implication that the categories about the box are in any
way equivalent and function in a (however rough) like manner. In fact,
each opens onto radically different dynamics, and it is precisely the
interaction of those dynamics that turns a simple discussion like this
one into something far more complex (akin to defining the butterfly
effect in Mongolia vis a vis a *specific* gust of wind off Lake
Michigan). Consider, for example, how an Althusserian conception of
ideology (that interpellation of identity: "Hey, you") functions within
each category.

In some sense, that is why the diagrams of Spicer's (from, I believe,
the Magick Workshop) are so appealing. It is precisely the
constellative play that needs to be brought forward.

I've argued before, and I'll argue again, no doubt, that what is
described in your box as Innovation is, ultimately, no such thing but
is felt need, a sense of lack, that drives one (rather blindly) toward
something the individual cannot name but must use her/his writing to
uncover/discover for her/himself.

How does this solve the problem of where St Marks Books ought to place
Fiona's book, or whether Rosmarie Waldrop should have labelled My Life
as a "novel" or the befuddlement booksellers everywhere felt towards
the collaborative project that was Leningrad (travel book, poem,
memoir, current events?). In your diagram, genre is (or at least seems
to be) some intersection between community and tradition. But what,
precisely, is tradition if it ain't community?? Is we a lion or is we a
moose?

Consider, for example, that non-group posed by Forrest Gander. Several
of the folks on that list--Taggart, Cole and Sobin, say (and to some
degree Palmer)--all share enough features to compose a group of their
own except that the Loner status with all its aching pretentiousness is
one of its major preconditions. All of them are male second generation
Black Mountain poets whose work is notably more timid than that of
their elders. And all of them are too much in love with a certain
codified sense of Beauty, tho it plays out in very different ways from
person to person (except that for all it comes across as some variant
of nostalgia). We could build a slightly larger circle here and toss in
some other folk who fit the category, such as Augie Keinzhaler, George
Evans, Eliot Weinberger. What keeps these folks from being a group is
precisely the AntiGroup politics they pursue. Which has an interesting
political edge to it, especially when as in Eliot's case it comes
across sounding ultraleftist with an echo of Pat Buchanan.

Another cluster of writers who could be legitimately grouped would be
poets who were trained ("educated" in the most literal sense) within
the academic poetics of the free verse '60s mode who have sometimes
been associated with langpo, largely because they have very lively
minds and can't keep their work from having lots of snap and pop at all
points: Gander himself is an example, as are C.D. Wright, Jorie Graham,
Ann Lauterbach and Bob Hass. These writers (and here is where Palmer
would come in again) have a more complicated relation to questions of
community and tradition and a very ambivalent stance toward innovation.

Now, as a thought experiment, if we built these two clusters as poles
or horizons of what might be possible, where on a map might we place
them and how would we then triangulate the writing, say, of the recent
work of Bob Perelman? While I agree that Charles' work is in many ways
extremely traditional, Perelman's recent pieces (e.g. The Manchurian
Candidate, the poems from The Marginalization of Poetry, The False
Dreams) seem to arrive at a traditionalism felt precisely as that lack
I was talking about above. In this sense, Bob seems a case (not the
only one--Frank Stanford's interesting to think about in so many of
these terms because he may be the one real outsider of the past 50
years in US poetry) in which the categories have all been stood on
their head. No?

From:    David Kellogg <kellogg@ACPUB.DUKE.EDU
Subject: Rasula and poetry zones

Pardon the lengthy description of my own work.  I post this here
because it is relevant to the discussion, and also because I'd like to
hear from folks who object to my account, so as to strengthen it. So
here goes:

Although I find Rasula's account of the four "zones" of poetry
compelling, Joseph Lease and Forrest Gander rightly point to problems
with zones as an operative category.  Assigning particular poets to one
or another zone is only one of these problems.  There are always
exceptions, such as Lauterbach and Gander himself, and the New
Formalism seems, as Lease pointed out, a blip on the poetic horizon,
fast becoming (if it hasn't already become) insignificant.

Rasula has his finger on something important, however.  In my own
work-in-progress on the poetic field (for an abstract, see
"http://www.duke.edu/~kellogg/sri.html"), I conceive these zones as
abstractions, POLES OF VALUE within the contemporary construction of
poetic practice.  (This work is obviously indebted to Pierre Bourdieu
in ways that I don't have time to explain right now.)  What Rasula
identifies as the MFA school corresponds more or less to a poetry
predicated on uncomplicated representations of Self.  Against this
obviously is the poetry of social conflict, community building,
identity politics, etc.  Call the struggle between these two poles the
horizontal (social) axis of the poetic field. Appeal to one or another
of these sources of value has little to do with form as such.  What I
call the formal, or "vertical" axis of the poetic field comprises both
NF and LP, but without naming them.  While the New Formalism is fading
fast, the appeal to "tradition" still operates within a lot of
contemporary poetry, even language poetry as it becomes canonically
interesting.  (I am speaking sociologically; I don't mean "interesting"
as an evaluative comment.) Against the appeal to "tradition" one could
place an appeal to "innovation."  So that the contemporary poetic field
looks more or less like this:

                         TRADITION
          ---------------------------------------
          |                                     |
          |                                     |
     SELF |          [the poetic field]         |  COMMUNITY
          |                                     |
          |                                     |
          ---------------------------------------
                         INNOVATION


It seems to me that this kind of a model is more flexible than a model
which operates in terms of "zones" or "schools."  As New Formalism
fades, the appeal to tradition is still operative.  As language poetry
becomes (to paraphrase Ron Silliman) more of a moment than a movement,
other possibilities begin to inhabit the arena close to innovation.
Obviously much language poetry would still be placed close to the
"innovation" pole, but individual poets' work could be read at various
places within the field. Moreover, poets might _move_, or be moved, as
the vicissitudes of canonization affect perception and reading.
(Charles Bernstein's work seems a lot more "traditional" now -- what
with various historical accounts of language poetry by Beach, Perelman,
etc., and what with the recovery of Stein and Zukofsky, and _The Tennis
Court Oath_ for a broader audience in various critical accounts -- than
he did in, say, 1980.  Also, Bernstein's own criticism has helped
create the traditional context for his work.)  One could also place
individual poems, "schools" (Iowa, Brown, Buffalo), and institutions at
various points within the field.

Well, whaddaya think?  Does this account via poles of value escape some
of the problematics of the zone/school?

Cheers,
David

Tom Beard (& others):  the original LangPo label (in all its permutations:
language writing etc.) was really initially a tactic, used by a loose

common sense is a collective noun, like religion: there is not just one
common sense, for that too is a product of history & a part of the historical

like ron, i see a problem with *any* spacialization of diverse human
practices, such as "zone" would imply... but let's do recall that rasula
offered such zones as:  (1) configured in accordance with the "genealogical
contours of contemporary american poetry"; and (2) that he was clear in
arguing that these zones were "utterly disproportionate in terms of size,
material resources, and internal stability"...

now in fact the spatial metaphor permeates rasula's text---a museum is a
space that serves in effect to freeze time... this negative reading of
historical-institutional space is what informs rasula's polemic...

so while it's true that we may be able to come up with more fluid or
diachronic metaphors to describe the various poetry alliances (or
"institutional consolidations," to use another of rasula's terms) out
there---if we're so inclined, i mean---it's likewise the case that
something has to "explain" the wax museum effect rasula has spent so many
pages detailing...

unless of course one doesn't see things (t)his way... i do, for reasons
i've detailed mself elsewhere... yet i can imagine other readings of poetic
practice over the past fifty years, readings that might emphasize other
sorts of effects... and i do believe that recent developments online and in
slam quarters have complicated the scenario of zone 4 as such...

Very subtle, Ron, those projections of value you offer to counter Kellogg's
grid as it (in your view) creates equivalences (equal valences).

So we're to believe that Taggart and Sobin are nostalgic, and pretentious to
boot?  Second generation watered down Black Mountain? (And Cole Swensen got
accidentally tossed in THAT pile).

On the other hand Hass and Graham etc. are like langpo in that they
"can't help" from having "snap and pop"?  Langpo charges the mountains of the
MacArthur?  Add some crackle to that snap and pop so we're SURE you're not just
spillin milk.  "Lively minds" indeed.  And blunt polemic.

And what exactly do you mean by saying that "traditions"--practices--are the
same thing as "community"--those bound together however loosely and with
whatever opportunity for innovation and transformation or resistance etc. BY
a whole BUNCH of practices/traditions?  You'll have to explain that one to me.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Hello Mark Scroggins:

        Good to hear from you on the list--I saw your announcement several
weeks ago about your U-Alabama book on Zukovsky. Is the book now
available?

        You ask me if there's a "puritan strain" in my critique of
entertainment, and wonder what would happen if I had used the word
"pleasure" instead of "entertainment"? But in fact the words seem to me
CRUCIALLY DIFFERENT words. Actually, I don't think I rejected the notion
of entertainment, but just the notion that EVERYTHING MUST BE
ENTERTAINMENT when it is not economic work, and I think very clearly that
it was the modern media environment suggests--there is a time for profit
making, and a time for entertainment. But "entertainment" is only one
aspect of pleasure, even of play--that there might be more complex
elements of pleasure and play than that simply of casual entertainment is
something that the modern media complex does not wish its subjects to
know. Hey, I love entertainment, but not when it's the only kind of
"pleasure" that's made widely available. I suppose entertainment does have
its active elements, but a more thorough notion of play might suggest that
play involves the ability to radically reformulate identity in the name of
what gives pleasure, whereas entertainment represents the more limited
notion of "relaxing"--i.e., taking time off from the labor that you have
had at best limited choice in undertaking.

Please excuse typos-this modem won't let me correct them today!

        Actually, Mark, on another subject--I'd be interested to hear a
brief description of what you take to be the central issues to Zukovksy
criticism at the moment. Yes, I'm sure it's in the book, but a preview
here would be most welcome...

        "Names are frozen laughter." who wrote that? Adorno?

"Beard by name and beard by nature." One can imagine!

'Bromige" which can be fromage or bromide to schoolboys & their sense of
humor,might be a topologico-botanical derivation, "the ridge with the
yellow broom(e) on it." But the closest I found in the UC Bkly cardcatalog
was "Bromig," a yugoslav (as there then were) who wrote about chemistry.
But we have a David Bromwich at Yale, I think, whose direction is quite
other than mine from the little i know. I was twice mistaken for him, the
funnier time being when i was invited to read at a soCal college (at the
instigation of a friend who taught there)by the person responsible who then
introduced me as the author of many fine essays. Well, and so i am, but
they havent been collected, and too fugitive i wd have thought to be known
to this young man. It unraveled slowly.

My name is hard to establish pronunciation of--our branch said "Brahm-idge"
and so do i. If i had it to do over, i'd use my middle name, Mansfield, as
a surname. "Take my advice, you still wellnigh anonymous persons out there"
coin yr own name (e.g. Miekal And, Jay Gatsby, Bob Dylan. . .). Engleburt
Humperdinck rmeains one of the more attractively outrageous handles, but cd
hardly have been invented?

For many years, Bob G R E N I E R  shared a house with Larry  E I G N E R.
(That wd be the Grenier who wrote the short poem PTOLEMY/ TUOLOME .)

Imagine having the cosmic good fortune as a poet to be born a Wordsworth. db.

from my vantage point, perched here on the verdant edge of
institutionalia,  Im personally less concerned about the practices &
intellect informing the consumers & the commidifers of poetry & have
been more participant in the endlessly unfolding social sphere amid the
actions of poetry itself, writing, publishing, NETWORKING, trying to be
moderately responsible for helping to distribute a tiny segment of
others in my networks who are working in similar streams.  with editing
xexoxial editions we have tried to purposefully chose each title as if
it represented its own territory, its own category & put it along side
of something that may seem contradictory in context, for instance where
does the work of Bruce Andrews intersect the work of Bern Porter.  in
writing our way forward toward less stringent collectivity, these
threads & pathways should be hyperwebs threading themselves in & out of
every possibility.  so for me, even david kellog's diagram of the
virtual field of poetry is still too foreground & flat to accurately
depict all the uncategorizable layers of languaging. (tho such an open
field over staid categories, is muchly preferable.)

This is just an aside to this thread, but I find this statement an
unfortunate stereotype, although one I understand. Seems to me that most
good contemporary museums (or those trying to be good and better) are acting
these days as community art centers, art activists, and more. The definition
of "museum" is not at all stable. And certainly the "buildings" are not
necessarily what constitute the museum as an organization or entity. While I
have argued specifically with every museum I've ever been around, about
exhibitions, particular programs, and more -- I have immense admiration for
the people in them and their attempts to make art a part of people's lives
in engaging, challenging ways. Unfortunately I have not yet read Jed
Rasula's book, but perhaps a reading of his museum as part of this wider
movement which includes "museums without walls" and more, would serve him well.

call for submissions to  p e r f o r a t i o n s 13:

                                                !!!SEX!!!

You love it, you hate it, you can't get enough of it, you wish you'd never
even heard of it, it's all you think about, you wonder what all the fuss
is about . . . whatever the case (and at times it seems that all the above
is the case, sometimes apparently simultaneously!) it is the case that
SEX, with capital letters, is in our face, at least those of us who are
infomaniacs, almost continuously.  And not 'gender' and not 'sexuality'
but  SEX, the grinding, moaning, messy, sheer horniness of whatever the
hell it is, the cultural environment is saturated with it.  You can't turn
on the television without it steaming up the place, news, sitcoms, drama,
talk shows.  It has become the cover story of seemingly every magazine
(and lets face it, most times, for most magazines, it's the cover story,
de facto--you want the best way to get some attention? you got two
choices: blow somebody away or blow somebody. And do it in public if you
possibly can.)  And the net . . . well, that's what got this issue of Perf
going.  Your humble collator happened to be cruising porno sites (it's
none of your damn reason why) and he was even more humbled by the sheer
mass of sex materials of every kind.  And yes he is aware that each
emergent info tech seems to be cuddled up to SEX, and of course the body,
before anything else whether the medium be cd-roms, photography, movies,
video, etc.

And the new rage in academic circles is --- the BODY! and, increasingly,
the sexed body.  It's almost as if the human race has suddenly decided
(relatively speaking anyway), in the agora as well as the grove,  no less,
that, WOW!  humans have this thing called a body and if you do these
things to it certain other things happen, usually 'pleasurable' (those
scare quotes indicating a certain indeterminacy as regards the
pleasure/pain stroke).  What's going on? Is it simply that systems of
representation have gotten so sophisticated that capital flow can now
fully exploit the most primal human  current(cies)?  That's not a
particularly new or original thought but.. . .  why then did he have the
feeling that a new plateau had been reached, some new border breached
within the last few years?

He thought in terms of one of his favorite--let's call it
Foucaultian--stories of the Victorians, being collectors generally and
plant fanciers especially, bringing in tons of orchids around the turn of
the century.  Not knowing all of their requirements but thinking:
orchids--> tropics---> hot-----> monus ponens, bony marony, good for
plants!  Especially when they flowered profusely in their hothouses (ie,
greenhouse), stoked to the max, the plants trying desperately to reproduce
themselves (and the victorians thinking Ahh! Success! Flowers!) --- before
they died en mass in due course, all orchids in fact not having the same
requirements.  A form of 'reproductive confessional' if you will.  Perhaps
you catch my drift, genetic and otherwise.

So, pick your target: fetish, s/m, dna, hetero, homo, repro, sublimation,
consumation, conflagration, the gaze, the Look, the lock, the haves, the
have-nots, the cunts, the cocks, teledildonics, Freud, fraud, fried,
freak, implant-love, border-crossers, cross-dressers, sex-changers,
chicken-sexers (can't tell'm apart -- chickens that is-- w/o yer manual),
celebates, cerebrates, celebrant swinger/orgy/baccanaliasts, one-handers,
lonely-hearts, no-hearts, mechanical hearts, (oops, no sex there!
hmm....), cyber-sexo-tekno-oedipo-shmedipo, elektric, tantroid,
latex-dipped, mutant futur-phreaks--- you tell us.  You know where we are,
you know what we do.  Help allay our confusion or: confuse us even more.
We await your orchid.

Alternatives, yes.  Oppositions, I'm not sure.  I should have spelled it
out more clearly.  Let's see.  I didn't mean to limit the Self as a pole
of value to "uncomplicated" representations; rather, I was trying to stress
that such representations (the product of MFA programs and
post-confessionalism) currently dominate that end of the social axis.
Nonrepresentational or complicated representational investments in the
self might be situated somewhere in the corner where self and innovation
meet.  Zen observation might be read as innovative in some communities
and traditional in others.  It might also be seen as invested in the
Community pole, which is not limited to identity politics.

These are not fixed categories; they are meant descriptively to account for
some of the ways in which poetic oppositions get socially represented (and
also to describe the academic process of contemporary canon- and
value-construction).

I think you're right, however, to point to the Community pole of value as the
wink link in my account, and the most tentative.  A bunch of disparate stuff
must necessarily get thrown in there.  I'm trying to figure out a way of
mapping my sense that various resistances to the Self as a source of value
have something in common.

One could present it in terms of a Greimas square (Self, Tradition,
Not-Self [Community], Not-Tradition [Innovation]).  But I'm not sure
where it would go from there.

Cheers,
David

miekal -- you articulate well what one response to poetic practice ---
through publishing and distribution -- might be... and as you might guess,
it's one with which i'm entirely sympathetic (if this don't sound
condescending i mean)...

charles a. -- yo, i didn't mean to slam "museums" as such... rasula in fact
invokes a *wax* museum, but (to simplify) he does use associated theorizing
that tends to regard the museum impulse as partipating in the general drift
of (other) carceral institutions (think foucault)... still, i would of
course have to agree that not all museums are created equal...

just want to add that I certainly agree that in some crucial respects the
zones are not escpecially fluid: I can think of many many many examples of
great poets whose treatment or lack thereof by any of the various zone
authority stuctures makes me wanna holler.

Of course.

my point was that any description of zones of aesthetics and politics does
provide us with several chances:

the chance to describe some of the particulars through which aesthetics
and politics are interconnected

the chance to acknowledge that the sociology of poetry can change (though
it may remain frustrating to those who long for real conversation)

more soon

Chris Alexander has a good point--I was willing to cut Publishers Weekly
some slack on the idea of named "camps" on the ground that they're
involved with marketing, & however much I'm not personally in sympathy
with the bulk of commercial trade publishing & its marketing mechanisms, I
see that given our actually-existing-capitalist-culture they're almost
predestined to use catagories like this....But Chris's point is I think
vital: in general, the most appallingly inert workshop verse is considered
commercially marginal, increasingly, by the retail book trade.  (This has
alot to do with the drive toward chain monopolization; to some extent it's
cause & effect, to some extent they are both outcomes of the same
homogenization/centralization mechanisms acting in culture, in tandem with
rightwing social agendas)  To what extent is identifying nonmainstream
trends, giving 'em labels & profiles, simply helping much of the book
trade pinpoint what they don't want to stock, what won't help them in
theri increasingly single-minded drive to maximize profits at the cost of
social and cultural values?

the social fact is that either all poets are outsiders or no poets are
outsiders or all poets are outsiders in some ways at some times: yes this
is a politics though not in a particularly Althusserian way: it's
ethically wrong to accuse poets who start from where they are rather than
a neomarxist meta-narrative (progressivist, foundational) of being
some emotional tonality one wants to dispraise since emotional tonalities
appear across the board in various political camps

I'd like to know if Ron Silliman agrees with Foucault that identity is
plural and the purpose of effective history (counter history, radical
history) is to dissipate it: this position is in severe conflict with
Althusser

Nope, I don't feel in any danger of conscription (though I've played around
on the avant-garde assault course for a while, and toy with the idea of
joining the territorials). I just get the feeling sometime (and this may be
a wrong impression on my part) that some people use the terms "language
writing" and "linguistically innovative" interchangably, and I didn't like
the implication that non-"language" writing couldn't be linguistically
innovative.

Oddly, Keith, I thought that Ron meant Norma Cole in his list:

I don't think Ron would fall into the trap of naming men by their last
names and then slip to a first name basis for a woman--I think Ron is much
too aware for that.

But then he added:

>All of them are male second generation
>Black Mountain poets whose work is notably more timid than that of

So I figured it must be some male Cole that I'm not familiar with.

Who is this mysterious Cole?

David,
Thanks for the clarification.  I too love "wink link" and wish I had a way
of looking at "community" without missing so many frames.  What do you do
with value placed not in poet's self but in other selves who wouldn't
necessarily identify as a community?  Message-in-a-bottle writing, I
suppose.  And there's poetry-of-self that's remarkably effective at a kind
of community-building (thinking of the huge audiences Sharon Old's draws,
for example, among people who don't pay much attention to poetry. Bly,
too.)  Just wondering out loud here, & your thoughts wd be welcome.

> Not-Self [Community], Not-Tradition [Innovation]).  But I'm not sure

That's hard. Too many wd say tradition is community, I think. (&
innovation is tradition, too.)  But I'm not clear on any of these terms &
shd shut up.

There is another guy in my town with my name. Peter Landers bids on
houses that are being auction off by banks. One day Peter Landers saw
his own name on the list of mortgagees whose homes could be his. Peter
Landers was shocked and looked through his property list but did not see
the address there. Peter Landers called the bank and they were both
confused until they looked Peter Landers up in the phone book. Peter
Landers finally met the guy whose calls he has been getting for years.
Peter Landers didn't buy Peter Landers' house. We now both use our
middle initials.

Ron,

Sorry -- sent that last message unfinished.  Anyway, I hope it should be
clear that I'm not trying to say _everything_ about the field, and that my
model is meant to be comrehensive (toward comprehending) rather than
totalizing.  I'm most interested in the macro-effects of reading and
evaluation.  But I think things can work pretty well on a local level
too.  I think in fact that these abstractions, as poles of value, _do_
interpellate us, in a real sense.  I won't argue with you about whether
there is any such thing as Innovation (or tradition, or the self, or
community for that matter); what I'm getting at is precisely the idea
that these concepts exist as horizons in the contemporary construction of
poetic value.  Nor does it solve any of the problems you've addressed re:
St. Marks Books, or the response to Leningrad.  It _does_ suggest that
the problems with the reception of Leningrad may have something to do
with the inability of many readers to respond to work that partakes of --
actually creates -- a number of communities via collaboration and
cross-national investigation and that _also_ appeals to an unstable
sense of literary innovation.

One thing that I want to make clear is that this description is not
evaluative, and that therefore it has nothing to say about whether this or
that poet might be "too much in love with a certain codified sense of
Beauty".  On the other hand, it does suggest that the relative prominence
of, say, Palmer among the people you mention may have to do with some
critics' perception (misperception?) that he has _resolved_ some of
the dichotomies between formal innovation and Beauty as an appeal to
traditional (i.e., codified) standards.  So one would have to work out
reviewers' positive responses to Palmer and less positive responses to
some of the others you've mentioned in terms of how they perceive the
mechanisms of "transcendence" versus "contradiction."  The difference
between the androgyne and the hermaphrodite is a matter of such
perceptual constructions.

One issue that your post raises is the question of groups.  Now, I really
don't have an interest in creating new groups per se, even if I had the
power (don't).  But how would groups be represented here?  Seems to me
that a group occupies a position in the field, but that that position is
changeable in a variety of ways.  For example, "Black Mountain" probably
opens somewhere toward the right-hand corner of my model (tho it seems to
me, in passing, that the anthology wars of the sixties suggest a
conflation at the time of community/innovation and self/tradition as
value-poles: the field almost loses a whole dimension).  By the nineties,
it has certainly moved "up," toward tradition, in the sense that an
engagement with BM can be seen as grappling with traditional forbears and
through them, with Pound etc.  It has also become more diffuse, wider, and
by the same token individual poetic figures eclipse Black Mountain as such
as points of alliance.  What I mean is that it makes no sense on some
level to call oneself a poet who learns from this "school", given the
emergence of full-blown poetic careers in Olson, Duncan, Creeley, and
related figures such as Jones/Baraka, Levertov, even (god help us) Dorn,
all of whom have more concrete meaning as points on the field right
now.   Where I would place this or that poet is not really the point.  My
placement would differ from yours; my reading of individual poems would
change, depending on my own context of reading and development (I am not
separate from the field, even as critic -- critical statements are
themselves interventions and carry weight).

Gotta go bathe the baby.  Picture's on my web site, if anybody's interested.

Cheers,
David

I got my copies of _Diacritics_ today.  Those who requested copies of my
article on Marjorie Perloff will get 'em soon.  But really, as I said,
you should all get the whole issue.  Much more significant stuff than
mine in there: work by Perloff, Bernstein, Waldrop, Lauterbach, Perelman,
and Aldon Nielsen (whose Black Chant, I want to announce publicly, is a
mindblowing achievement).

Cheers,
David

The Collingwood formulation is that art requires discipline at the
beginning and gives pleasure at the end, while entertainment requires no
no discipline but gives no nourishment (fake fat? diet coke?)  I like
Bateson's formula better: that entertainment is the food of depression,
the absence of joy that feeds the absence of feeling.

But how little?   I would associate with Hejinian, Bernstein, and, a bit
later, Leslie Scalapino, among many others, a position that would claim that
formal issues have -a lot- to do with the way the self is constructed
through the poem's formal strategies, the general idea being that
fragmentation of the narrative (even the referential) effects of language
serves to foreground the making-up-of the self from somehow analogous
fragments.  Maybe what I think is that the minute you talk about
'representations' (not just of Self) you're talking about, among other
things, form.  I'm sure that others here could put this more
clearly/insightfully.

Also, Bill Manhire has come up here a couple of times.  I highly recommend
his witty collection of short stories, published in the U.S. as -The New
Land- (can't recall the publisher, sorry).  Are there any of his poems
readily available in this country?  The UCLA library has a selection of NZ
poetry, but it peters out in the early 90's.

Finally, is no one here going to tell me how to contact Joel K. Meow?

Michael,
the categories you suggest in your initial post sound good to me--with some
exceptions:

Scratch "Language poets"--term meaningless to Barnes & Noble audience;
Multicultural (not poetics--poetics is something else)--fine (and there's
really no need to break that down0; spoken or performance poetry--why not
simply Performance Poetry; St. Mark's of New York School--as with "Language,"
overly pseudo-specific; Formalist--old hat (= Old Hat, in fact, but you don't
want that); same goes for "mainstream" etc.: why not Traditional, and Open
Form; Classical--OK, I guess; Poetry in Translation
--OK.  So, then, this would be my list:

Traditional
Open Form
Multicultural
Performance
Classical
In Translation

The first four, of course, overlap in a multitude of ways, but a simple way
to distinguish Trad from Open Form would be--for starters--to put the books
reviewed in the New York Times, NY Review of Books, New Yorker, etc., in
Trad, and then take a look at the rest.

had taught college. It was the requirement of symmetry, to which i had
obliged myself, that after each poet i named, there would be a parenthetic
"Time magazine" phrase indicating that this one, too, had college
connections ; i guess i picked "darkened doors" for you because i thot it

enjoying the parallel discs on names and poetry schools, arose by any other
name, the power of labels aof names, numerologically and other logics.
to have a name to change.
to group under a name so as to better understand or at least contain.
as my own poetry cuts across lables, incorporates, a real eclecticism, a
pastiche trying to organically combine. and poets i feel closest to dont let
me in.
so we stride.
a name i'll never be called by.
my name the way a dog would say it.

Perhaps the confusion is due to the fact that Essex Hemphill appeared in
both Marlon Riggs's "Tongues Untied" AND Isaac Julien's "Looking for
Langston."  In any event Essex's death is a major loss to poetry, queer
studies, gay literature, African American literature, American literature,
English language literature, and the planet in general.

The audience for poetry is small.  Most of us would rather relax with a
carefully-constructed (fictional) artificial paradise and a beer, than
read some poverty-stricken poet's feeble translation of real paradise,
drinking our cup of water with Milton.

There is a connection(s) between aesthetics and politics, but we might
ask, what's criticism for?  Baudelaire wrote a short essay on this in
which he said that trying to follow the sober analytical critics to poetry
is taking the long way around (if it's a way at all).  Study, for the
poet, he said, remains in the studio.  The prime relation is between the artist
and the audience.  The honest critic will (paradoxically) partake of the
enthusiasm and inspiration of the artist h/she critiques.

Poetry is a kind of human fire, but it's not spread by a new analytical
approach to language or technique.  It's imaginative fire (the longing for
paradise) tempered by experience (fire tempered by the sword).  Pound was
right, I think, to imagine that the potential for paradise on earth is
reflected in the past, underneath all the tragedies and insanities.  The
age of gold is buried in the Gilded Age.

There must be something roughly paradise-like about Our World if there's
a little press in the Canary Islands called Zasterle that publishes little

is but he writes beautiful poems.  Maybe somebody else can take a turn doing
a review, this little book deserves one.  I'd quote but I don't have it in

Mark W:
actually, I'm not sure I wondered whether there was a "puritan strain" in
yr. post, but rather suspected one--as I all too often suspect one in
many poker-faced condemnations of maypoles and frolics--but your posting
here does much to clarify what you said, and I agree with you here
wholeheartedly.
Yes, the LZ book is out and shd. be in stores as we speak.  The main
issues of Zukofsky criticism?  1) (really an issue of LZ scholarship)--to
establish and get into print the texts themselves--the "A" we have is
rife with typos, the Complete Short Poetry simply isn't complete and has
its own textual problems, the Apollinaire book, "First Half of "A"-9,"
and "Arise, arise" are out of print.  2) to think about Zukofsky as a
"usable past," as an influence on younger poets than him--everybody knows
Creeley read LZ, Duncan read LZ, etc. etc., but no-one to my knowledge
has thought really carefully about precisely what they learned from his
work and where they took it--and this goes double for poets of the
"language" generation, who were growing up reading LZ, many of them.  I'm
not talking simple influence study, but a thoughtful consideration of
what remains productive and instigative about the work, and what might
have to somehow be relegated to the dustbin of "high modernist"
practice.  I realize this sounds pretty dry, but once I put on that
critic's hat, I turn pretty dry...
best,
Mark S

TEACHING THE HUMANITIES TODAY

On Friday, February 2l, faculty in the humanities from the University of
California and the California State University will hold a conference to
discuss common problems in teaching in the humanities. The conference has
emerged from two exploratory meetings hosted by the Humanities Research
Institute in 1995. It will take place at the Henry H. Huntington Library in
San Marino, California; Robert Ritchie, the Library's Director of Research,
and Professor of History at UCLA, will open the session.

The event is co-sponsored by the HRI and by the Division of Academic
Affairs, Office of the Chancellor, California State University. William
Weber, Professor of History at CSU Long Beach, has planned and organized the
meeting. Faculty will come from campuses of the two systems to discuss
issues involved in teaching popular culture, framing lower-division core
programs, and making  pedagogical uses of technology.

There is a $12 charge for lunch. If you are interested in attending, contact
Bill Weber,  (310) 985-4426, for further information.

really I love the one at EPC, especially when high school kids & the
like get on there. its fascinating, the kind of stuff I would love to
be able to include in my work from time to time but just cant
produce--that clumsy sentiment in awkward lines. I'm reminded
of Cage's story in SILENCE of being at a cocktail party where the
host & hostess gave a wretched performance of the entire score of
a second-rate operetta. there was a buddhist monk in attendance, &
part-way through Cage looked over to see how he was taking it.
as I recall, Cage says something like "The look on his face was
beatific." you know, Duncan insists that there is no good or bad
poetry. I'm not inclined to agree, but--well, it bears some thought.
I mean, what one considers "le bad" has its uses & even a strange
sort of beauty in the right context. I only wish I had earlier work
(like from h-s) of this nature to draw from--forlorn love poems,
poems addressing friendships in peril, that sort of thing.
malheureusement, I was far more serious in that embarassing
romantic sort of way--as I recall, my early notebooks are replete
with the familiar awkward gestures of the Romantic--despair &
solitude, phrases ending with "of emptiness", lots of "empty" &
"emptiness" throughout--coupled, oddly enough, with infantile
gestures of explicitly political rebellion which seem to range over
all territories--facsism, marxism, even democracy movements. I
distinctly remember being enamored of the graphic used by the
american news media to signify the Polish democracy movement
Solidarnosc (sorry no diacretc)--that sort of silk-screened looking
red banner. too, I had read both The Communist Manifesto &
parts of Mein Kampf by the end of 6th grade, with apparently
little grasp of either outside of the rhetoric, & had an early
fascination with the figure of Mussolini & the austere grandeur of
fascist art & architecture. you can imagine the jumble all of these
make in the notebooks. I havent looked at them in years--its
amazing to me that I remember this much. I shall have to bring
them back next time I head east, or maybe have them sent.

yes yss I like this. we could do a collaborative project by email
with this sort of technique. one thing I should like to stipulate,
though, is that the length of the work be cut down considerably,
say, to 20 lines. this is simply because I will have to do my part
of the work (reading & manipulation) here at work, & with the
size of the samples youve sent thus far that would be unmanagable.

I'm wondering what kind of shape this method could take. I mean,
if we have to start with smaller texts & delete, your suggestion of
some kind of stricture for maintaining portions of those texts
becomes crucial. one possibility might be simply an approximate
ratio to be retained; for instance, we could establish that no more
than 1/4 of the text may be changed in a sitting. further, I might
suggest that no more than 1/4 of the already-transformed material
be changed, if thats not too complicated. what wed have then is
something like a diminishing realm of action, & that would also give
us an established stopping point thats a bit more random than, say,
an established number of rounds or entries per person. the changes
may be hard to spot at times so of course I think these rules should
be loose in their application, meaning I probably wouldnt challenge
you if you were to make what might otherwise (in Monopoly) be
thought of as an "illegal" move/change. hmm--strange thqt a sort of
negative image of the rhetoric of gamesmanship should crop up here.

oh--make sure you cut off those little darts > each time you
work on the poem--otherwise well accumulate too many. unless
of course you want them as part of the work yr doing.

>Do you want me to send you that paperback book thing?
oh yes absolutely yes.


>  Perhaps you knew all this!
no I'm afraid j & I are not in contact. this is not a source
of disappointment to me--we did have a sort of falling out,
though I couldnt attach an exact moment or event to that
feeling. I can say, though, that it had to do with her increasing
involvement with erin & gail--& her tendency to turn her
back on linda & I at parties & receptions where it would be
possible/more profitable to associate with them. partly that
has to do with friction [mildly] between linda & erin; partly
to do with j's--personality. in any case, I honestly dont have
much respect for her either as an artist or a person. knowing
as you do my poetry-poetics-politics, can you imagine j & I
across a table from one another, even over a guinness? & thats
not even considering the personal so-called baggage that
conversation would have to carry.

"oh, dont end so heavy" says.
well--heres my first cotntribuation
(I cut it to 20 printed lines if thats ok).

The more I think about all this agony over categorization, the more I think
we've strayed far from the original intent of Michael's posting, which I
interpret as simply a call for a strategy to make bookstore managers/buyers
aware of the range of poetry available to them, and disabuse them of the
too-prevalent assumption that the only poetry worth stocking is what comes
out of Norton, Knopf, and (if they're feeling really adventurous) Wesleyan
and Pitt.  I don't think it serves poetry's readership to subdivide via
shelf labeling what are already pitifully small poetry sections in most
bookstores; the interpretive spectrum of categories -- while interesting to
discuss in a listserv -- is too large and abstract and overlapping to
inflict on a readership that simply wants to browse and make its own
decisions, thank you. The bookstore managers just need to be aware that Sun
& Moon, Roof, O Books, Hard Press, etc. have readerships every bit as
interested and devoted as any other literary press, and that the store is
just as -- if not more -- likely to sell one or two copies of, say,
Michael's book from Sun & Moon, as it is the latest Alice Quinn-annointed
newcomer.  It's not so much a question of educating poetry readers via
shelf labels as it is educating poetry providers through articles in trade
journals (like PW) which they as business professionals are required to
read.

Nick Piombino is also the author of that wonderful, weird essay collection,
_The Boundary of Blur_ from Roof Books.  I'll certainly seek out the
poetry.

I'll second this, at least the part about the book. Don't know much about
paradise, but I'd suppose Zasterle would be something to help compose one.
And certainly if you want to know more about Nick Piombino, also read his
essays in The Boundary of Blur, a book published a few years ago by Roof,
which is marvelous.

I do have LIGHT STREET in front of me after recently finishing it. I don't
find it very excerptable in really short bits, but I do like the sections of
the title poem a lot, so here is section 3 from "Light Street."

3. Learn to wait.
Stroke the velvety silence.
Time's furry coat.
Not even a step, no move at all.
Blank? Good.
Impatient? Sorry.
Describing it is o.k.
One watery cup.
Reading.
Mending.
Going back.
Someone came between.
But this one also drifted away.


I also love the "book-ness" of this book, its size and shape and other
characteristics, and particularly the cover design by Rosa Ventura. But then
I'm always taken by these Zasterle books put out by Manuel Brito.

This Dorn fellow seems to be reviled by many right now, for reasons I
understand. But are things he has done even worse than Pound, or Adorno (a
not too-long-ago thread here), that the mere mention of his name requires a
prayer? And are people still reading his work, some of which I still find
insightful and quite brilliant?

Dear Ron Silliman,

Perhaps I should have said historiography: obviously Foucault means and I
meant history the discourse not history the gooey stuff we all walk around
in all the time and from which there is no escape (yawn).

Foucault  seems to have been a kind of dervish of post-historical
carnival.

His commitment to dissipating the idea of a unitary identity was ethical,
obviously political in the broadest sense: like a law that would make all
prisoners judges.

I agree that Foucault uses counter-history as a Telos: he celebrates it
even when he says there is nothing to celebrate.  Much the way Jameson
celebrates Perelman in utterly romantic (apocalyptic) terms in the pomo
tome.

So the problem comes in for Althusserians this way: if subjectivity is
created by hailing, where is that critique located and what does it
generate.  I think that in your Leningrad piece (the piece on the task of
the collaborator) you say that structuralism and poststructuralism taught
poets that individuals don't exist.  There's a severe conflict between
Althusser's certainty (the opposite of Cezanne's doubt?) and Foucault's
belief that individuals do exist emeshed in culture and history and power
and multiple multiple multiple identies and because they exist they can
chart culture and politics in a more effective way than they could if they
didn't exist.

This question is not directly (as in the fallacy of imitative form)
related to choices about how to write: how much representation and what
kinds how much abstraction and what kinds.

But Foucault, like Lyotard, is deeply suspicious of old-boy
meta-narratives.  For example, a marxism that takes John Asbhery's you
can't say it that way anymore and tries to give it historical determinist
messianic force.

You once referred to the wounded-Buffalo school of romantic
second-generation Black Mountain outsiders: that's in the same Leningrad
memoir (a very subjective and personal reminsicence): my point here is not
to defend individual poets but to locate the discussion of poetry zones,
which discussion usefully opens the sociology of poetry and defnition and
production, within an awareness of specific writing practices . . . with
all their textures, all their graniness, tangy, palpable, audible,
differences.

All best,
Joseph Lease

Soliloquy
An Installation by Kenneth Goldsmith


"Scheue Dich ja nicht davor, Unsinn zu reden!
Nur mu=DFt Duf auf Deinen Unsinn lauschen."

(Don't for heaven's sake, be afraid of talking nonsense!
But you must pay attention to your nonsense.)

--Ludwig Wittgenstein


During the week of April 15, 1996 to April 21, 1996, the text-based artist
Kenneth Goldsmith tape recorded every word he spoke from the moment he woke
up until the moment he fell asleep. He subsequently transcribed the tapes
into a simple word processing program, removing all peripheral language
except his own; the words were then strung together into seven separate
paragraphs (one for each day), thus creating the raw material for
Soliloquy, to be presented at the Bravin Post Lee Gallery opening February
8 and continuing through March 7.

Soliloquy is an installation whereby the second most ephemeral human
product, speech, is materialized and concretized in the gallery setting. If
Goldsmith is to be taken as a somewhat typical example, then an average
human being speaks 183,685 words each week. The artist has taken this
week's worth of blather, printed it out (no editing, of course), and
plastered the walls of the gallery, floor to ceiling, with three hundred
forty four 22" x 30" sheets of paper containing nothing other than what he
spoke during this one week last April.


"If every word spoken in New York City daily were somehow to materialize as
a snowflake, each day there would be a blizzard."

--Kenneth Goldsmith


Soliloquy, in its profound black and white silence, calls into focus one
our most basic (and most often taken for granted) functions: the role of
speech in our everyday lives. Speech is flexibly construed as either a
public or a private human function; we are often guarded in what we say to
others, hoping not to be overheard. However, just as often, we are
self-consciously aware that we are using language in a public way, meant to
be heard by many. How we define ourselves and how others see us in the
world is constructed by what we say. A monumental step in a child's
development is the first recognized public use of language. Words are
spoken, and then just as fast, they disappear. Goldsmith has frozen that
which we often would like most to forget; in doing so, his own language and
speech have been seized and made totally public.

By turns humiliating, enthralling, boring, tedious, absurd, absorbing, and
yet always overwhelming, Soliloquy puts speech and its attendant issues
under a magnifying glass. "The gallery will be covered wall-to-wall with
bad breath and I'll be sure to get out of town as soon as it goes up. You
can't believe all the things I said that I wish I hadn't," says the artist.


REPORTER: Why don't you write the way you talk?
GERTRUDE STEIN: Why don't you read the way I write?


Soliloquy opens Saturday February 8 and continues through March 7.

I wasnt so much thinking active avoidance
[Pubwkly as "how not to shop"] as lack of interest--
from the pov of most bkstores, why seek new poetry
titles, especially work that challenges the mainstream?
but its the latter half of that question tells me youre
raising a very possibility. on the other hand, hell,
theyve avoided us this long without a guide simply by
not purchasing books from any of the relatively smaller
presses. so how much dmg could it really do to remind
them were here. I just dont expect it to do a lot of good,
either.

again, though I wnt to emphasize that this has a lot to
do with the way we buy poetry. if you have a good
local bkstore (not a chain), why not place some of yr
SPD orders through them? I'm as bad about this as
anybody--I love to have those packages come right to
my door. but if enough people do it, they might take a
hint(or a suggestion). & it goes without saying that
we have to continue to support stores like Bridge St.
that do act as venues for good work.

re schools & categories, of course one way to blur the
pigeon-holing effect might be to highlight presses, not
zoos or zones or movements. maybe presses are still
subject to being fixed in their orientation from the
outside ["isnt that the one that publishes X?"], but
it seems to me that an article that shows the press at
work, ie a diverse catalog of publications, could avoid
that effect. maybe something like a brief editorial interview
coupled with a catalog & samples.

well, now I've drifted into fantasy.
or maybe just transposed the problem.

from '79 through '82 -- published Michelle Parkerson (whose film on Audre
Lorde is being shown again on some PBS stations this month), Sterling
Brown, Ahmos Zu Bolton, Robert Hayden, (the irrepressible Judson Crews!),
several early works by Harryette Mullen, Joanne Jimason, Maxine Clair and
many others including your correspondent, then a student -- Great art

Michael Cuddihy wrote a book, essentially a memoir, about _Ironwood_ which

come across anything like it really. An editorial memoir. However I can only
assure you of its existence, can't remember title or publisher, can't find my

SPD had, perhaps still has, some backissues of Ironwood.

Try "Sheet Music: Poems 1967-1982", Victoria University Press 1996. This is
a collection of his early poems, most of which had been out of print for a
long time. His more recent books, "Milky Way Bar" and "My Sunshine", also
from VUP, should also be available, but IMO they're less interesting.

I have a longish review of Sheet Music and My Sunshine at

        "http://www2.met.co.nz/nwfc/beard/www/my_sunshine_sheet_music.html",

in case you're interested.

     --I have gotten that impression before myself, and also doubted it.
"Language" writing, if not taken to be the grossly abbreviated version of
the same (?) word in caps with equals signs between the letters (L=A=N, etc)
is exceedingly problemantic, since all poems use language. "Always already"
to borrow that annoying Derridian phrase. B. Perelman, in his recent
_Marginalization of Poetry_ discusses various terms for the poetry that is
his subject, but I wasn't very happy with his (non) conclusions. (People
might argue there are poems that don't use language, eg "sound poems,"
"visual poems", but here the word poem is obviously modified with another
word--suggesting that the word "poem" is meant to describe an abstract form,
like a "feeling" or an "idea", though probably closer to the former than the
latter in the US today--and this is something I hope to get back to below.)
     All "language" and "non-language" (or "traditional") poems use
language, then. (I am being painfully simplistic and verbose in an effort to
worry this out.)

     All my examples are the most obvious possible.
     I suspect many on this list have thought this all out before but I this
is an attempt to at least give words to my understanding, with the hope that
people will agree or disagree where they deem appropriate.
     I apology for the length.

     And most contemporary poets probably consider there use of language to
be innovative (a term that comprises one boundary of the poetry field we
have seen recently). From the modernists forward (maybe from the French
Surrealists forward) I can think of few of even the most widely sold and
read poets who would not consider themselves linguistically innovative: the
late-great Frost being one (though even here not necessarily the
_relatively_ young Frost Pound promoted), probably Phillip Larkin another,
*late* Eliot, etc.
     As a rule of thumb, the less widely sold and read, the more likely a
poet considers herself and is considered (by whom?-) innovative. Perhaps
that's a stretch (provoked). But this would make sense in as much as *our*
society (US, late 20th C) tends to consider poetry a politically radical
activity and a progressive art form, and those poets who feel they are not
getting enough public attention (not carried in enough bookstores, not
taught enough in The Academy, etc) would probably rather assign this lack to
their relative progressive- rather than regressive-ness. (ie, it would
perhaps sound a little odd to hear a poet from this list say, "I'm just too
fucking Old-Fashioned to be taken seriously!")
     And we have R Silliman's comment [damn, I haven't that post on this
computer(I have to switch computers in the middle of the day)] that by
"Innovation" is perhaps meant a drive shared by all poets, a groping towards
something that seems to each writer unrealized (in language, in form,
tradition, community, what have you or them). And I remember M. Bernstein in
a post some weeks back saying that poetry was "revolutionary."
     But what constitutes "language poetry"? Not the fact it uses language.
Not the fact that it uses language in an "innovative" fashion, at least not
in a general way. But the term is used relatively easily, and clearly
applies to some poets and not others (that "language poetry" as a label may
always be stretched or snapped doesn't matter, as most any labeling of
poetry "schools" may be as well, and the exceptions in this case do not
effect the general rule, which is the function of "language poetry" as a label.)
     "Language poetry" sometimes refers to work that is characterized by
broken syntax, sometimes fractured words, etc., either deliberately (eg,
Bernstein) or as the result of a method of textual generation (eg, Mac Low).
     "Language poetry" sometimes refers to work that calls into question
"representations of the self." Usually along the lines of demolishing the
notion of the much-encompassing "lyrical I" in favor of poetry that eschews
this "voice" in favor of a more "dialogic" (though I have never seen anyone
on this list refer to Bakhtin's Dialogism or Social Heteroglossia) or
"multi-vocal" voice. This is sometimes accomplished mimetically using the
form described in the previous paragraph. Mac Low states as much in the
Afterword to _The Pronouns_. Others have elsewhere. However, in general I
find this categorical definition as incomprehensible as the "Innovative" one
because there is much cross-over with poets usually considered outside the
"language poetry" realm. For example, Bob Hass, like Mac Low, has claimed
the importance of a "Buddhist belief in voice" (not quoting either one
exactly) as imforming their poetry. And the question of how much any writer
has personal or monological control over her voice is old and historically
varient.
     "Language poetry" refers sometimes to works that are very
"conventional" looking and sounding, but are written by "language poets."
Recent B. Perelman as an example.
     "Language poetry" often seems to refer to works that are not widely
bought and sold, stocked by Barnes and Noble, etc. In this sense "Language"
seems a substitute for "Marginalized." At the same time of course our
society is so relatively large, diverse and loosely-knit, and generally
poetry-illiterate, that this Marginalization has to be primarily economic,
since there is more than enough "room" in the field of "Language poetry" for
an intersted party to read contentedly for quite some time, provided they
don't expect to find what they want in the local store (distribution being
regional, of course--you won't find any poetry in the Hallmark in Laconia,
NH, for example), and (along the same line of reasoning) since "mainstream
poetry" is not all that popular (except in the Academy) compared, say, to TV
or doggeral, it might consider itself marginalized as well.

     I must break off now.
     Where does one go from here?
     Among the many, what are some-things I've left out?

Moose.  Actually, "tradition" in my schematic is not the same thing as
community (what I have also called, perhaps more accurately, the socius).
so genre as such is nowhere located on the field, although "lyric" seems to
occupy the top-right corner and some forms of "witness poetry" the bottom
left.  The community/socius pole bears a big resemblance to what in
Bourdieu's model of cultural fields goes by the name of "heteronomy".  I'm
speaking, remember, of the differences between a formal and a social appeal.
So tradition is neither community nor practice -- rather, it's the sense of
pastness that operates differently in different contexts -- one poet might
invoke it through reference to rhyme and meter and another poet might invoke
it by, say, allusion to Lowell.

One might think this way, for example, about the issue of journal
publication.  The poet who publishes in _Poetry_ or _APR_ in 1997 engages,
by this gesture, primarily in an appeal to tradition, whereas the poet who
publishes in _Tinfish_ or _New American Writing_ might be engaging primarily
in an appeal to community.  This is because of the different way the
journals operate, one as a repository, the other as an ongoing dialogue.  So
a New Formalist magazine like the now-defunct _Reaper_ engages first, in
building a community of like (light?) minds, even as that community attempts
to revitalize the appeal to "tradition" (in part by recasting it -- i.e.,
writing in rhyme and meter -- as the true "innovation."

Part of my point in constructing this model is to claim that the poetry biz
collectively misrecognizes the diversity of poetic practice and the
different  -- sometimes incompatible -- appeals to value by invoking
something called "poetry" to cover the whole hog.  Critical "success" in
this account is nothing less than the seeming erasure of these different
poles.

Why fine? I think this is the most confused and problematic of all labels.

Usually what people really mean is 'other cultures' which prescribes
immediately who the book is for & not for. If there were a language element
to it, there could be a non-English based category - but that leaves out
those who chose to write in English. Even the old boiler post-colonial is
better than multi-cultural though carrying its own complications.

Or perhaps multi-cultural implies that the poets are themselves
'multi-cultural' and maintain multiple-culture-personalities, but then don't
we all to a certain degree.

Perhaps you need other labels such as 'indigenous' (a horrible word tho), or
an 'international' that has poets broken down to their respective
nationalities or alliegances. Perhaps there is room for an identity poetry,
or even anti-colonial.

Just some thoughts,

Above all other things. I really have to agree with Anselm. The various
"avant" names that are running around will not be of interest to most of
*Publishers'* audience. Language is as poetry is, lingusts and poets are
specialists that have a specialty audience (unfortunately) if we go into
pseudonomous designations then we are losing the general reader.

I don't think we want to lose the general reader any more than we already have.

Manuel has been seemingly sending XE all of his titles as well, so have
seen a wide selection of his very consistently delicious little books.
When I get frustrated about distribution issues Im reminded of what he
must feel like living there Tenerife, Canary Islands, & speaking only
halting english, publishing a lot of american writers & trying to get
those books around the states.  Worthy of a few hoo-has anyway.

Yes, I still read Dorn's work --

No, he hasn't, so far as I know, done anything AS BAD as Pound --

But is that some immutable measure -- I don't know if Alan Golding will
remember this or not, but several years back at a dinner following
sessions at the 20th century lit. conference, Dorn made remarks that made
my skin crawl -- more cowardly then, I spent the rest of the evening at
the other end of the table with Chris & Deborah Parr -- should have
confronted him on the spot -- Dorn has much of interest to say still --
as many of us witnessed at Orono last year -- but he's also shown himself
a bigot in unforgivable ways -- does one have to have exceeded Pound in
some kind of sweepstakes of prejudice?

cf. Lapine, the language of rabbits in Adams' _Watership Down_.  Rabbits
can't count higher than four, so anything more than that is "hrair",
meaning "many," "a lot," often translated as "a thousand" (or occasionally
"five").

It should have been obvious but:

I didn't argue that history has a purpose,

Foucault argues that counter-history has a purpose.

I suggest you look again at Foucault's discussion of genealogy and
history: there's a problem for Althusser there.

(Who's Zoning Who?)

Consider, for example, the group of poets consisting of W, X, Y, and Z.
All middle aged males, they recognized early in their poetic careers
that fame, in contemporary American society, is a function of marketing,
and that the marketing of ideas about poetry especially requires a gang
(also known as a "school" or "group"), as their spiritual forebears,
the New Critics, had effectively demonstrated. They formed one and
then proceeded to successfully market each other through the gang's
various magazines, publishing houses, anthologies, and University
courses. Sharing an acute Oedipal anxiety about the poetries which
preceded them, they proposed their writing as being involved in a
radical social-historical "rupture". This served to cover the fact
that they neither understood what constitutes beauty in the
contemporary world nor were capable of engaging the complex question
of its importance to poetry (seeing it presumably as somehow displaced by
justice). Instead, relying on polemical attacks on "genre" to cover
their tracks, they produced a lackluster, prosaic "writing" in which
simplistic ideas about "ideology" were masked by syntagmatic verbal
trickery.

And I had figured Peter Cole, of Leviticus "fame."  Maybe because
growning up in Detroit in the '80s (and not knowing of the Tish's) I used
to think that Conjunctions was the canonizer of contemp. lit/po.-- (I blush
to reveal that to this list.) Anyways the writing world is a lot wider
than Bradford Morrow's A list--but  the formulation of Taggart
Cole Sobin could be easily mistaken for a Conjunctions school
by a 17 year old.

Zasterle Press certainly  w a s  in the Canaries. Manuel Brito is, I
believe,its editor/publisher. This press has done many handsome books by
many poets known to listmembers,I ween--a number of them L=A=N poets. Our
Listmaster will perhaps fill in the gaps.

I have written abt L=A=N poetry as a movement within a tendency.

I always found the analogy useful when i was teaching, of the poem as a
window so clean as to be invisible, so that the scene it gives onto,
dominates; or the poem as a window so interestingly flecked with cobwebs,
flies, dirt, etc, that the scene beyond fades behind such immmediacy. This
latter, of course, being langPo. I'm aware this leaves a lot unanswered,
but it made a handy place to start.

It leaves out the struttin' pomposity of many clean-window poems, where one
cant not-see the window because the figure of the poet gets in the way.

LangPo may be this tiny, marginalized semi-group effort certain people on
this list perceive, but its influence is everywhere visible. Not a
maindrains poet whose work doesnt reveal that, as the 80s progressed, its
author took on some coloration from L P.

Neo-formalism is in my opinion down to LAngPo too. I wd see it as well, as
a reaction against the workshop poem. Btw, announcements of the death of
the avant-garde continue to reveal the imperative of novelty.

Happy typo of the day: lingusts. (as in "a plague of lingusts has been
feeding upon the General Reader"?)

Enjoyable, too, is the deliberate homonym "light-minded." "We were of light
minds so we floated up to an early circle."

Yeah, except this was on a Thursday. Sun Ra, in those days, played every
Monday night at Slugs's. I wish I had been there then. I would have worn

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

At birth, in the late 1940s in Italy, I was named Marina Ada Paolina
Oleario-de Bellagente. (a long story.) Came to Amerika in mid 50s and
whenever a teacher began stammering, I would just say "present." In "the
sixties" (ahem) I was Liza Bread to many of my friends, and Marina Bostedt
when I published poetry; in the 70s I became Marina LaPalma as I hand
typeset the title page of the first book we ever printed as Kelsey Street
Press (Neurosuite, translations from Italian of Margherita Guidacci's
poetry.) In some parallel universe I have been for 16 years a certain
Mrs.Goldstein. My husband is named Richard Goldstein, but at the age of 15
he re-named himself Rich Gold. It is now his professional name as it was
through the 70s and early 80s as an electronic artist; he is legally still
Richard Goldstein but does get checks for Rich Gold sometimes and hotel and
car rental bookings in various parts of the world can be annoyingly
ambiguous or unstable because of it.

Our child, Henry is named after my maternal grandfather Enrico. [One of my
cousins in Boston is named Henry. He is now in his sixties and has always
been an artist; for many years, on the various gallery notices I received,
he was "Henry"; Then, ... around the time that anything Italian (Armani,
arugula, caffe-latte, Bruno Magli) ascended to the zenith of trendiness ...
he was transmuted into" Enrico".] Our son has been assigned the paternal
"Goldstein", partly to weave him securely into the rather large Goldstein
clan; but since he was  adopted at birth and we have a good relationship
with his birthparents and their families, he in fact began life listed on
his hospital birth certificate as Aleister (after Crowley) Drake (as in
dungeons-and) Jozens (his birthmother's name.) This was just a sort of
courtesy or formality, as we all knew that a few months later when the legal
adoption was finalized before a judge, the state of California would issue a
new birth certificate listing me and Rich as his parents and giving him the
name we chose. When he grows up, he can pick from among these, as well as
his birthfather's last name, which is Crites. So there you go -- seven-plus
names on the mailbox and counting.

Most of the time I will only write reviews of books I can get excited
about. Why spend time on what doesn't set me on fire? And I agree, too,
with another post which raised the question of whether there is good and
bad poetry. I find that I am always amazed at what I can discover in "bad"
poetry. In theater, for example, I know that I have learned as much from a
"bad" production as from a good one. Something about a good production
allows me to settle back and enjoy, whereas a "bad" production forces me
to figure out why. And in figuring out why, I often see other
possibilities that are covered up in the good performance. I'm not sure if
this is as true with poetry. It may even be more true with some "schools"
than others. I'm going to have to think about this. I've always felt that
a review, to lesser or greater degrees, should generate some of the same
excitement that the work being critiqued generates.

David -- While I find your chart interesting and intriguing, I also
find it very troublesome and indicative of what I see as a limitation
(and modernist hangover) in contemporary theory/crit.  Why the
obsession with mapping poetic endeavor?  From the tenor of your
comments, I take faith that you are not propounding fixity or stasis.
However, why do we (under the unfortunately uncomplicated shadow of
Jamesonian Marxism) insist on enumerating the differences between
individuals?  How is it that the philosophical endeavor is to
investigate the boundaries between individuals?  I know, this is a
history that goes waaaayyyyyy back (Nietszche, no, Aristotle), but
that doesn't make this history any more sacred than any other.  What
if we give up on the notion of spatial metaphors as ever being
sufficient, or even ultimately useful, and try to work instead with
the problem of contact and interchange -- i.e. Levinas or even
Heidegger.  That is, posing the question of difference this way: how do I
know I'm not you?  What if an encounter with otherness is really a
frightening and threatening brush with the loss of self through
intimacy?  How might posing the question in these terms of fluid
interchange effect our understanding of poetic "schools"?  And, via
Levinas, what exactly do we mean by "difference," anyway?

It seems to me that a notion of identity as existing through the fluid
interchange/exchange with difference is what much "post-modern" lit.
and poet bumps up against.  The notion that my identity is not defined
by my charting of my fourteen different subject positions, but through
my complicated residence in the fluidity of the one.

Just some thoughts.

Best --

Rod--Heard a spot on NPR the other day about independent book stores
and music stores, respectively, forming support networks in order to come
up with strategies to combat the big-chain takeover.  One of the
assumptions (a good one) was that the independents tend to have
knowledgeable and motivated staff, more aware of local needs and
interests.  Nothing surprising there.  But one of the ideas was that fave
"local" artists wld be featured at other stores in the (non-local)
network.  Thus, more "product" for the stores and more distribution for
the artists.  Also, on the music end of things many major labels were in
fact more than willing to work with these networks, happy to have
another outlet.  Any networking going on up DeeCee way?

I think we're confusing Dorns here.  I believe that the Dorn Charles refers
to is "Dr." Alfred (or Albert?) Dorn, arch-Formalist and president of the
New World Order of (something) Poets, an organization which sponsors annual
contests for the best sonnet,  villanelle, etc., and sends out
mass-mailings to Poets & Writers listees.  Much as I like experimental
work, I don't break out in hives when I read a rhymed sonnet, either.
Still, this guy is a little scary.  Has been photographed affecting a cape
and pointy beard.  He's published work in _The Hudson Review_, and I think
_The Formalist_, among others.  Though he's ardent in his promotion of
strict traditional forms, it's not clear where he stands on Social Credit
or the efforts of the Axis Powers to take over the world, so I doubt that
comparisons to Pound are warranted.

Speaking of Zoos--

a friend e-mailed the following to me this morning.

Dodie

--------------------------------

We all joke that "everybody" has done a zine, but NOW I actually believe it
- - the plot of today's episode of Sesame Street is that Big Bird does a
zine! They use the word magazine not zine, but that's the basic idea of it.
He watches people buying various specialized magazines at Hooper's Store,
and asks whether there's a magazine just for people like him - - big birds.
When he's told that there isn't such a thing, he throws a small tantrum,
then decides - - ta da! - - that he'll do one himself! Rest of the episode
follows him as he draws a cover, comes up with story ideas, does an
interview, has photographs taken, puts his issue together, etc, and creates
Issue One of BIG YELLOW BIRD. (Didn't see how the episode finally ended - -
snuck off to take a shower instead.)

HOW GRANDFATHER FLEW

Grandmother sculpts birds of smoke
with her cheeks, tongue, lips and puffs them
sailing through her wedding dress hung
like a curtain and stained as yellow
as the sunlit dust her creatures shatter into.
And somewhere in the sack the day drags behind it,
a lost hawk worries the storyteller's campfire,
swooping and kissing the tale with his wings.

DORNETTE

The name donated him when he was born
worn in good stewardship for forty years
and polished like a medal for his peers
was neither square nor round - but it was Dorn.

One syllable - and yet it was a horn
that trumpeted his fame from here to there

that doorway to the glory that was Dorn.

If I could be an Alfred or an Ed

TO THE LISTSERV

Aliens have inhabited my aesthetics for
decades. Really since the early 70s.

Before that I pretty much wrote
as myself, though young. But something

has happened to my memory, my
judgment: apparently, my will has been

affected. That old stuff, the fork
in my head, first home run,

Dad falling out of the car--
I remember the words, but I

just can't get back there. I
think they must be screening my

sensations. I'm sure my categories have
been messed with. I look at

the anthologies in the big chains
and campus bookstores, even the small

press opium dens, all those stanzas
against that white space-- they just

look like the models in the
catalogs. The models have arms and

legs and a head, the poems
mostly don't, but other than that

it's hard --for me anyway-- to
tell them apart. There's the sexy

underwear poem, the sturdy workboot poem
you could wear to a party

in a pinch, the little blaspheming
dress poem. There's variety, you say:

the button-down oxford with offrhymed cuffs.
The epic toga, showing some ancient

ankle, the behold! the world is
changed and finally I'm normal flowing

robe and shorts, the full nude,
the scatter-- Yes, I suppose there's

variety, but the looks, those come
on and read me for the

inner you I've locked onto with
my cultural capital sensing device looks!

No thanks, Jay Peterman! No thanks,
"Ordinary Evening in New Haven"! I'm

just waiting for my return ticket
to have any meaning, for those

saucer-shaped clouds to lower! The authorities
deny any visitations --hardly a surprise.

And I myself deny them-- think
about it. What could motivate a

group of egg-headed, tentacled, slimier-than-thou aestheticians
with techniques far beyond ours to

visit earth, abduct naive poets, and
inculcate them with otherworldly forms that

are also, if you believe the
tabloids, rather salacious? And these abductions

always seem to take place in
some provincial setting: isn't that slightly

suspicious? Why don't they
reveal themselves hovering over some New

York publishing venue? It would be
nice to get some answers here--

we might learn something, about poetry
if nothing else, but I'm no

help, since I'm an abductee, at
least in theory, though, like I

say, I remember little. And yet
this writing seems pretty normal: complete

sentences; semicolons; yadda yadda. I seem
to have lost my avant garde

card in the laundry. They say
that's typical. Well, you'll just have

to use your judgment, earthlings! It's
your job! Back to work! As

if you could leave! And you
thought gravity was a problem!

Subject:      die a critic

My chairperson put a copy of the brand new Diacritics in my mailbox, with this
note attached:  "This arrived yesterday and I thought you might have a more
immediate interest in it.  I'd like it back at some point but there's no
hurry."

So I've been thinking about that note and reading around in the magazine
instead of doing what i should be doing.  I want to say first that the
chairperson here is a well-meaning, curious man.  I took it that his decision
to pass on the magazine to me involved a judgment; he had more important
things to do than to read it (now).  And that's what I've been thinking about
in the wake of this poetry zones business.  A few random remarks:

Jonathan Monroe is to be congratulated for moving the discussion of exploratory
anti-genre, anti-disciplinary "poetries" into the moneyed domain of composition
and rhetoric pedagogy.  I'm not going to take up his arguments, or problems I
might have with them--though JM's enthusiasm shines brightest in his suggestion
that 3rd graders might be made to read Bob Perelman's "China" beside Frost. The
real value of JM's article is simply in recognizing the power of this pervasive
institution.  Want an audience for exploratory poetry?  Want efficacy for its
practices? Then find a way to get it into composition courses. Except that,
having tried as much, one wants to know how to keep the discipline from
showing up again after what is taken as "the party," as carnival, is over.

I've also been looking at the listmaster's contribution.  Some of those funny-
banal (or is that banal-funny) poems called "Memories" are included.  And no
doubt many an astute reader will note that once again Mr. B is crossing genres
in his essay-text.  But what I noticed is that the text is a collage of
fragments some of which were written for other purposes and occasions.  It
begins, for instance,with a message CB wrote to this very listserv (so much
for keeping membership down, Charles,for "word of mouth").  And there are (I
suspect)other passages written for elsewhere, imported into this text.  The
"traditional" justification for doing something like what CB seems to be up
to would be the pursuit of a better or more perfect articulation of one's
claims.  (A second, slightly less traditional use of these tactics would seem
to involve the narrating of one's own process of composition--I said it once
like this, and now i say it like this, or I said it once like this, and this is
what I want to make of all that now.)  But I'm not sure that this is exactly
what CB is up to (perhaps he might clarify).  I think that CB is moving things
around, putting it in new constellations for new occasions and situations, as
a way of combatting that very glut of information which makes my chairperson
inclined to put aside this very Diacritics.  Approaching the unapproachable
(Cavell), saying again and again, and saying just a little differently not
necessarily to say it "right"--he's given up that fantasy--but to re-deploy.
But increasingly i'm thinking of that re-deployment--that moving stuff round
from listserv to essay, talk to essay, etc.--as a tactic that might be (and
is)imagined as a response to--as it were--the glut confronting my chairperson
as a rather desperate sign.  Say it again and again because nobody is listening
Glut confronts glut in a melancholy aesthetics of proliferation.

Just a few random, spontaneously generated and probably incoherent words to
clog your disk, by way of a first  and partial review of the Diacritics issue
all deserve congratulations for.

Just wanted to definitely agree with others that Nick Piombino's new book
Light Street from Zasterle is well worth reading, as is BOUNDARY OF BLUR
which also received some recent plugs. But I did want to mention Nick's
other collections of poetry--his first book, POEMS, and an issue of
Abacus, FROZEN WITNESS. His work can also be found in AVEC, CHAIN,
SITUATION and many other publications. To my own sense, one of Nick's most
interesting explorations involves what he once described to me as "the
poltics of attention"--the way human consciousness, in its priveleging of
some forms of phenomena over others, inevitably reflects built-in
ideological biases. Much of Nick's own poetry seeks to challenge an
unconscious "politics of attention" through language and other material
techniques designed to bring consciousness back to attention to itself,
rather than remaining an unconscious immersion in unquestioned social
ideologies. One of the things that makes his poetry so interesting is that
he's always looking where one least expects him to be looking.

Just want to add to the glut & say I take no responsibility for the "sonnets"
and other splursions of "Jack Spandrift."  I've known him for a long time -
a small-town librarian & small-time crook from Bludget, Wyo, with a huge
chipmunk on his shoulder that eats rhyme and meter for lunch.  His
execrable take on a man's good name (it is the 13th, after all) warrants
severe derision.  His only redeeming statement was when he wrote in
a previous post that _Gunslinger_ is the "funnest"[sic] epic ever
written, which I agree with 100 percent.

Ignore Jack Spandrift, people. Or write a derogatory "driftette".
He deserves all the buffalo shit out there (excuse, me, I mean glut).

Thanks, Bob --

sitting here at my word processing cubicle in my DC patent law
firm as the afternoon lates, I enjoyed that.
Interesting you're expanding themes of *Virtual Reality* (I guess
it was called?) in yet-weirder ways.
In lieu of an in-person reading, this was a hearty pick-me-up.

regards,

Congratulations Bob Perelman!

Never, while I've been on this list, that I can remember (and I'm not saying I
can), has a posted poem produced such quick and diverse responses from its
participants.

It is an appropriate summation of the "audience" thread that has woven through
the dialogue recently.

Me? I enjoyed reading it-- twice.  And then, after I "sacked" a second phone
call to voice-mail, I deleted it forever, with a flick of the finger.

Warmly,

Thanks Mark for mentioning POEMS. It is
truly a great book. And Sun & Moon Press
is still offering the book at a price of $5.00.
Hope everyone will get a copy and read this
remarkable poet.

Interesting to consider how much of this "privileging of some forms of
phenomena over others" is ideological and how much is biological - we tend
to notice things that may be a physical threat to us, for example. Which
may be why red is a good colour for attracting attention - red things in
nature are often either signals of hazards (as in some animals' and plants'
warning colouration) or on fire. Bitter things are often unripe. Sudden,
loud noises were often signals that something was about to fall on us or
eat us.

These are very crude examples, of course. But the human capacity (read:
mania) for setting boundaries and dividing the world into categories may
have somehow developed out of the fact that edge-detection neural systems
appear at a very basic level of our visual perception.

Tricky, but yes. How much of rejection of "self" (& g*ds know I sympathize
when it comes to poetry as dull bar seduction, see what a sensitive
dude/brave dudette I am) also throws out what wd be worth preserving if
the revolution ever succeeds? I'd love to see a lot more rejection of ego
& superego, to adopt some retro terms, and more plumbing into the part of
self that says why it's worth staying alive, worth seeking out other
humans, worth the hassle of fighting through Babel and money and
resentment.  Silly beauty & foolish truth, because it's foolish to care
that a primate band invents justice & somehow tries to make it, & silly
if you see & think to go on living, but we do.  Where are the gifts that
keep *that* weird enterprise going? I find bits & pieces of them in all
kinds or reporting & recording, but rarely find anyone willing to value
them in public.

P.S.:

Kudos to Bough and Perelman for their prose poems (even though the UFO shtick
is a little old hat).

P.S. 2:

Surprised to see Ron Silliman's 'classification' of Palmer Cole & Taggart as
post-Black Mtn sentimentalists go unchallenged.  In my humble opinion, at
least the first two are Way Ahead of Murk, Mush, and Tedium (as are Dorn
Baraka Blackburn Oppenheimer, to mention just a few who began the practice of
their art long before the Holy Ghost of LangPo descended).

Right on, Wendy.  g*d knows WE'RE ALL SICK OF MY EGO, but...here goes again...
I had a little essay in the last Witz on the Russian conference where I
tried to distinguish between "self" (that straw bogeyman of "left" poetics)
and "Person" - "Person" being (in part) the expressor of Russian philosopher
Chaadev's concept of "moral freedom" - an anthropocentric idea generally
denied in all kinds of determinism (from the social Necessity of some versions
of leftist justice to the market Necessity of this country that makes
cowards of us all).  Maybe beauty in poetry expresses the moral freedom of
Person rather than Self.  See Mandelstam's essay "Chaadev" for more info.

Yeah. the beauty of oral history.

Here's a Valentine from Salman Rushie:

The [London] Guardian February 14 1997

On the eighth anniversary of the fatwa against him, Salman
Rushdie castigates Europe's politicians for cynically abandoning
the ideals of free expression and human rights

THE DIPLOMATIC VICES

EUROPE begins, as the Italian writer Roberto Calasso reminds us
in The Marriage of Cadmus And Harmony, with a bull, and a rape.
Europa was an Asian maiden abducted by a God (who changed
himself, for the occasion, into a white bull), and was held
captive in a new land that came, in time, to bear her name.  The
prisoner of Zeus's unending desire for mortal flesh, Europa has
been avenged by history.  Zeus is just a story now.  He is
powerless; but Europe is alive.

At the very dawn of the idea of Europe, then, is an unequal
struggle between human beings and gods, and an encouraging
lesson: that while the bull-god may win the first skirmish, it is
the maiden-continent that triumphs, in time.

I, too, have been engaged in a skirmish with a latter-day Zeus,
though his thunderbolts have thus far missed their mark.  Many
others - in Algeria and Egypt as well as Iran - have been less
fortunate.  Those of us engaged in this battle have long
understood what it's about.  It's about the right of human
beings, their thoughts, their works of art, their lives, to
survive those thunderbolts; and to prevail over the whimsical
autocracy of whatever Olympus may presently be in vogue.  It's
about the right to make moral, intellectual and artistic
judgments, without worrying about Judgment Day.

The Greek myths are Europe's southern roots.  At the continent's
other end, the old Norse creation-legends also bring news of the
supplanting of the gods by the human race.  The final battle
between the Norse gods and their terrible enemies has already
taken place.  The gods have slain their foes and been slain by
them.  Now, we are told, it is time for us to take over.  There
are no more gods to help us.  We're on our own.  Or, to put it
another way (for gods are tyrants, too): we're free.  The loss of
the divine places us at the centre of the stage, to build our own
morality, our own communities; to make our own choices; to make
our own way.

Once again, in the earliest ideas of Europe, we find an emphasis
on what is human over and above what is, at one moment or
another, held to be divine.  Gods may come and gods may go, but
we, with any luck, go on for ever.

This humanist emphasis is, to my mind, one of the most attractive
aspects of European thought.  It's easy, of course, to argue that
Europe has also stood, during its long history, for conquest,
pillage, exterminations and inquisitions.  But now that we are
being asked to join in the creation of a new Europe, it's helpful
to remind ourselves of the best meanings of that resonant word.
Because there is a Europe that many, if not most, of its citizens
care about.

This is not a Europe of money, or bureaucracy.  Since the word
"culture" has been debased by over-use, I'd prefer not to use it.
The Europe that is worth talking about, worth re-creating, is
anyhow something broader than a "culture".  It is a civilisation.

TODAY, I am listening to the melancholy echoes of one small,
intellectually impoverished, pathetically violent assault on the
values of that civilisation.  I refer, I'm sorry to say, to the
Khomeini fatwa whose eighth anniversary this is, and to the
latest barbaric noises about "bounty money" emerging from the
Iranian government's front organisation, the 15 Khordad
Foundation.

I'm also sorry to say that the EU's response to such threats has
been little more than tokenist.  It has achieved, in one word,
nothing.  The Europe for which Europeans care would have done
more than simply state that it found such an assault
unacceptable.  It would have sought to place maximum pressure on
Iran while removing as much pressure as possible from the lives
of those threatened.  What has happened is the exact opposite.
Iran is under very little (I would even say, no) pressure on this
matter.  But for eight years, some of us have been under a fair
amount of stress.

During these eight years, I have come to understand the
equivocations at the heart of the new Europe.  I have heard
Germany's foreign minister say, with a shrug, that "there is a
limit" to what the EU is prepared to do for human rights. (A few
months after this statement, Germany, then Iran's biggest trading
partner, gave a red-carpet welcome to Iran's terrorist-inchief,
Intelligence Minister Fallahian.  My Norwegian publisher, William
Nygaard, was shot the week after Fallahian's triumphal tour.) I
have heard Belgium's foreign minister tell me that the EU knows
all about Iran's terrorist activities against its own dissidents
on European soil.  But as to action?  Just a world-weary smile;
just another shrug.  During Italy's EU presidency, the Italian
foreign ministry refused to answer - even to acknowledge - our
letters on this issue.  In Holland, I actually found myself
obliged to explain to foreign-ministry officials why it would not
be a good idea for the EU to accept the fatwa's validity on
religious grounds.

I have been refused entry to Denmark, on the spurious grounds of
a trumped-up "specific threat" against my life, a threat which
mysteriously vanished in the face of a public outcry; but I know
that Denmark, already a major exporter of feta cheese to Iran, is
presently trying hard to increase its trade relations with that
country.

During the just-concluded Irish presidency, I was offered a
meeting by Dick Spring which then, oddly, took six months and a
lot of pushing actually to arrange.  In this meeting Mr Spring
assured me that a strong statement about the fatwa would be
included in the conclusions of the Dublin Summit.  No such
statement was made. (Ireland, too, is looking to expand its trade
with Iran.)

This new Europe has not looked to me like a civilisation.  It is
an altogether more cynical enterprise.

EU leaders pay lip-service to the great European ideals--free
expression, human rights, the Enlightenment, the right to
dissent, the importance of the separation of church and state.
But when these ideals come up against the powerful banalities of
what is called "reality" - trade, money, guns, power - then it's
freedom that takes a dive.  When it's Danish feta cheese or Irish
halal beef against the European Convention on Human Rights, don't
expect free expression to win.  Speaking as a committed European,
it's enough to make a Euro-sceptic of you.

In a few months, the United Kingdom will enter the EU "troika",
and will then, for a year and a half, have a real opportunity to
resolve this problem.  I hope - I think, after so long a wait, I
have the right to expect - that the British government will,
during this period, be a good deal more active than it has.  So
much of diplomacy, I've learned, is a matter of nods and winks.
The extreme passivity of the Foreign Office has permitted the
rest of the EU to go to sleep on this issue, and has given the
Iranians the sign that there is really no need for them to do
very much at all.  I am of course pleased that the Foreign Office
has condemned the new bounty offer, but a few stiff words once a
year are no substitute for a policy.

LIKE so many of my fellow-Britons, I hope there will soon be a
new Labour government.  I have long been urging that government-
in-waiting to understand the importance of the arts in conveying
the sense of national renewal which Labour must seek swiftly to
create.  Today, on this tawdry anniversary, I ask Mr Blair to
come to the aid of this one particular artist.  As he knows, and
has been good enough to tell me, the principles involved go far
beyond the survival of a single individual.

I ask him to bring a new spirit of urgency to the fight against
the Zeus of Iran and his attempt to kidnap our freedoms; and by
doing so, to show New Labour's commitment to the true spirit of
Europe - not just to an economic community, or to monetary union,
but to European civilisation itself.

It must really be valentine's day 'cause the poison arrows are flying.

At least when Silliman wants to smear somebody by linking him with Pat Buchanan
he uses a name.  Not that there's much doubt who Mike B means by W, X, Y, and
Z.  I've always preferred Q's work myself, though the oedipal complex in N
is a fascinating curio, and the lit-crit narratives of legitimation in $$ are
the subject of one of my best student's ponderous dissertation.  But if I had
three kids, I'd be sure to name them after Murk, Mush, and Tedium.

Listen, I knew Murk, Mush, and Tedium.
Murk, Mush, and Tedium were friends of mine.
(Many an evening we'd explore simple-minded discourses of ideology.)
And you, Mr. @@@, are no Mush.  Nor Murk.  Nor Tedium.

Subject:      Perelman and theory and stuff
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I've been reading Rasula's Wax Museum, which has sparked a lot of very
good dialog on the list recently....It is interesting that I've just
gotten to the part where he suggests a fundamental failure in the language
circle, arising from their not collapsing theory and practice into a
single form, a poetry that is also theory--(...from one point of view,
that is certainly going on in Andrews' crazed "poetics essays" but Rasula
was writing before last year's publication of Paradise and
Method, which collects those pieces and allows you to see just how
challenging and odd Andrews' "theortical" writings are..)

I think Perelman's been thinking along these lines, and I think the poem
posted here was almost as good as the one that opens Marginalization of
Poetry and gives it its title.. In fact, his work has always been a
favorite of mine; the books Face Value and First World are such models of
how to be skeptical and passionate and committed about politics within a
non-mainstream writing mode, kind of it seems to me a separate
developmental track running parallel to Silliman's less hectic new
sentence strategy: parallel tracks running in the same direction (left).

Some postings don't seem as positive about Perelman's poem as I was...But
I'm not always good at interpreting arch gnomic asides.  I loved it
anyway.

Rasula's point is kind of fascinating (--I haven't finished the section
where he develops this theme, so I may not fully represent his views..)
On the one hand part of me thinks you (we, them?) don't have to meld
theory and poetic writing into one new mode..On the other hand, there's a
real exploratory integrity to the idea that it is a historical/esthetic
imperative.. His belief that more people would find LangPo non-abstruse,
if the creative writing contained theory, seems to me too easy (again,
take a look at Andrews' essays, one example of creative writing explaining
itself which I don't think will win over many academics tomorrow)

One final connected note: I think Rasula's American poetry wax museum, and
Perelman's Marginalization of poetry, are two of the best and most
generative books about poetry I've ever seen; if you haven't seen 'em, I
recommend it.  Perelman's is shorter and more hands-on in examining poetry
directly.  But both are about SITING u.s. poetry--locating it in current
social and cultural dynamics.  Vital.

to pick up for a sec on what keith t. is saying on this subject line,
vis-a-vis jonathan monroe:  to align poetic practice with recent
developments in comp/rhet. would require that poetry is discussed not
simply in terms of its products but in terms of its processes... i think
much is to be gained, at least wrt the academic sites of poetry production,
from looking at the way process is taught (or not taught)... to harp/hop on
my hobbyhorse of late, that notion of "craft" is part of what i see
blocking productive associations between comp. and poetry... it's b/c
"craft" works in effect to stabilize product through a certain rigor, a
certain form of attention...

this is not an argument against attentiveness as such... i'm talking about
the way "craft" tends to be institutionalized... i add here only that
"craft" -- insofar as it's theorized -- represents one way (but only one
way) to safeguard the laboring *body* of the writer... but there are many
other ways...

so it would seem to me to be helpful in discussing poetry, or poetries, to
consider the process aspect more fully (somebody mentioned mac low's work,
which is to the point here if only b/c mac low attends so consciously to
process, yet in ways that craft-oriented writers might not appreciate)...

again i think it's worth noting how many books are out there that presume
to discuss the "writer's craft"... invariably these books seem to advocate
a specific aesthetic, or aesthetic approach anyway... and of course what
gets left out, finally, is so much of art itself---b/c the way "craft" is
generally deployed in the classroom, it consists of rules and techniques
(if not outright gimmicks) that can take most only so far---right up to the
verge of art, but not art itself... which in effect safeguards art against
those who would presume to understand it more fully, who would presume to
place art on a continuum with other social practices---and once again
confirms that the artist is born, not made, the artist-as-genius, as
romantic savant, as any-number-of-unconfirmed-sightings...

it's not a matter of making art easy or known or verifiable... seems to me,
though, that we can do better than advocate procedures that have the effect
of reducing what passes for 'proper' aesthetic process while situating most
who aspire at a clear remove from the possible plays of process...

lots more to say here, but i'll close with that...

best,

joe

Subject:      Bronk Panel at Oxford, August 30, 1997

I am writing in behalf of Dennis Ryan, who is organizing a panel on William
Bronk to be held as part of a one day conference on Estrangement, to be
held at Oxford University on 8/30/97.  There are I believe three "sections"
of the conference, one on literature and culture (which is where the Bronk
panel would be), another on psychology or something like that, and a third
whose focus i've forgotten now.  Anyway, the conference is interdisciplinary
and otherwise is quite unconventional.  EAch panel participant will have
written a thousand word essay, which will have been published with other
like essays for the general consumption of the entire conference.  EAch
panelist will come to the conference with a much longer version of this
essay, and will meet with other panelists in the morning in a workshop
format.  I.e., all the Bronk people, a minimum of six and a maximum of ten,
will spend the morning exchanging views and also coming up with a document
of some sort, written collectively by the entire panel, which will be
presented to the entire conference in the afternoon.

Or something like this.

Well, if you  are interested in participating, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE NOT
AN AMERICAN (there are 4 Americans on the panel already--myself, Henry

well is it then a matter of making an art our art for we (I) are different?
we have something else to say and do, yes, but does that place us in the
rather restricted relation of OPPOSITION to an exclusive and rewarded
TRANSPARENCY PRACTICE? Don't think so. I mean, if you're one of the
hegemonic boomers, you may HAVE to see it that way, but if you're on either
side of that bracket (or you just WANT to be) there seems to be more
permission to exist in other relations. I can hear it now, we're WUSSING
out on the Hegel score. Hey hey ho ho. But this insistence on the
opposition-relation, that seems like only a recent recurrence of a syndrome
of turf warring (MAPS) that comes and goes as new resources are alleged to
be OUT THERE .. go dog go .. of course I love tulips as much as anybody ..
I also love MY TRIP, SOME OTHER KIND, RESPONSE, IN MEMORY, etc, etc more.
Is this an opposition? Is elsewhere an opposition? Seems more like an
affirming negation from here. TRANSPARENCY PRACTICE offers more than the
OPPOSING TEAM seems to want to admit, at least openly .. I guess you can go
on being THEY indefinitely .. but why? why not elect oneself central? or
peripheral? and get going with the vantages already? there do seem to be
non-monotonous people listening non-monotonously, at least as long as they
can stand it .. until they give up .. Signed, A PERMANENT CRISIS IS NO SUCH
THING

 Hi Kevin!!

Interesting?  Yes & no.  "No" because it is oversimplified, "yes" because
it's true...  First, poetry as such was not illegal: there were many
"communist" poets and there was poetry even on TV!  On the other hand,
there was also poetry which went against the grain.  Not necessarily in
the sense of being anti-communist, by no means, but simply because it was
"real", which is to say, it was about things and feelings "outside" the
official ideology, it was about anxiety, nothingness and death, or about
common everyday things, or about faith and God, etc.  While now the time
is more "prosaic" and poetry seems to be too pathetic to be true...
        And Swarzenegger?  Well, you know what the majority of Canadians
likes watching, don't you?!  And you don't think that people in Central
Europe are different species, do you...

By the way, VOTOBIA is a really interesting publishing "company"; their
editorial plans are "rather" nonconventional. Moreover, they are from
Moravia, and not from Prague -- which [that is Prague] always tended to
present itself as the only cultural centre in the republic. And this
"voice of marginality" is another "sympathetic" (as we would say in Czech;
guess what it could mean!) feature of Votobia.

Take care!

yes yes of course its important not to lock
ourselves into this position--art is about
more than burning newspapers--, but lets
not deny that its one possible assessment
of a poetic practice--as limited as any other
single assessment, but not more.

yes, elsewhere is an opposition of sorts,
& I should think we ought to be able to
frame it that way if/when its useful to do so.
the work acts as an affirming negation only
when its taken obsessively in terms of opposition:
"I see my work as oppositional practice--
thats all really". I dont recall anyone doing
that here recently--do you?

> TRANSPARENCY PRACTICE offers more than the

I always considered myself central, really.

after an object or a day of the week (have to

As the creator of one such "stupid graph," I would like to say that I don't

I blieve, Chris Alexander, if that is your name --
that the guiding logic at work here is oppositional -- viz Hank Lazer's
opposable poetries, viz Bob Perelman's we is another poem, viz Ron
Silliman's comments here and Cap-l -- I belive that Bruce &rews is
relentless in his opposition, and that of the lpoets maybe only Charles B
has gone on to oppose opposition and maybe he hasn't -- maps are for
claiming resources and for sittling arbitrartions, charts are for
malapractice -- the crisis goes deeper, lads, and the initials are
everywhere .. wussy hegel glottal simpatico, contra dante sounds .. and

Just finished reading a wonderful article by Tom Standage in The
Electronic Telegraph (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/) called "Romances
of the Telegraph" about how the introduction of telegraph
and telephone technology caused fears not unlike those caused by the
internet today about illicit relationships. I'll quote a few bits
just to get the point across. To read the entire article you need
to register at the above URL (it's free) and then search for the
article. I only hope that e-mail and related technology moves quickly
into the realm of the 'safe' now occupied by telephones.

"An article entitled The Dangers of Wired Love, published in 1886,
warned of the consequences of allowing women to use new
communications technologies without supervision."


"One 19th-century cautionary tale concerned George W. McCutcheon of
Brooklyn, who ran a news-stand assisted by his 20-year-old daughter,
Maggie. Business was booming, so, in 1886, he decided to expand and
install a telegraph line, with Maggie as its operator. But he soon
discovered that she was "keeping up a flirtation" with several young
men over the wires, including Frank Frisbie, a married man who worked
in the telegraph office of the Long Island Railroad. Over the wires,
Maggie invited Frisbie to visit her, and he accepted. But when her
father found out he forbade the visit, so Maggie began seeing Frisbie
on the sly. McCutcheon tried moving his news-stand, but Maggie soon
found work in a nearby telegraph office and resumed the relationship.
Eventually, her father pursued her to a rendezvous and threatened to
"blow her brains out". She had him arrested, and he was charged with
threatening behaviour."


"There was even a novel called Wired Love, written by Ella Cheever
Thayer and published in 1879, which built its plot around an online
courtship - and beat today's slew of dreadful email romance novels
to the punch by over a century. And in 1891 an article called
Romances of the Telegraph rounded up other stories with happy
endings."

"Other articles talk of the telephone's tendency to lower moral
standards. "It's appalling," said an elderly aunt, reported in
Telephony in 1903, "to see how they use telephones nowadays. Last
night Mary, who was dressing, answered the telephone in her
room. And it was a man calling her up. The two of them stood talking
to one another just as if they were entirely dressed and had stopped
for a little chat on the street! I tell you this generation is too
much for me."

Jordan,
remember that Hegel tune "I don't need your summary acts to give into the
narrative age"? The problem with elsewhere is there's usually lots of
tourists there. Hell is other tourists? (I remember something about an
up-to-date theory of time.) Adorno (clap hands clap hands) says on the first
page of Aesthetic Theory
". . . however tragic they appear, artworks tend a priori toward

To:Beatrice@celestial.rosa

not sure why but i'm feeeliing really frisky now and you are the target of
my emoticons. good thing i'm knowhere near you 'cause i'd be massaging
your feet into an erotofrenzy. and since the medium is the massage. you'd
have to succumb numb into my passions. i'd swallow you. hollow you. hallow
you. gentle .  swelling desire delirious. you are delicious. i'll take two
scoops. packed into a daydream like summer laughter and freedom. i burn
with optimism's flame. the wondiferous splendor of your sparkle. a smile
that moves me to song. a choir to the graceful dance of your moonbrows.
ever freshing the fountain. superluminous murmurs coil my sensation. the
juice of your memory slakes my drought. i dream of buttering your
muffin. sleep well knowing that in one mind melancholy with the tears
from the wake of your passing, an ember burns amber like ale stout in its
steadfastery. hidden from the make-up of the a public face. deep in the
soul. a coal remains. hear it cry with steam as teardrops bake into its
lumina. soul coal. dream steam.  emotions like motions owe prayers to the
source. i stroke you. i stroke you. i stroke you. evocative notions. be my
guide to awareness. breathe into my daytime. slip into my night. let me
squeeze your freshness every morning. let me brush my teeth with your mind
at knight so my nocturnal excursions are quessts for pearl necklaces and
the slaying of insecurities. and inhibitions. ambitious but ample ,oh
apple of my pie. let me bake you into a cake. run down my chin. melt my
cream. satisfy my sweettooth. swim in my tastebuds. splash in my saliva.
slurp up my sunshine. surrender to my songcraft. with my shipsong packed
with poet's art, can my word keel crack your frozen heart? will you be my
valentine. will you hold my hand. will let me hide in your shadow safe
from eyes of judgment. can i play in your shade? can i draw on your
sidewalk. can i skip to your heartbeat? can i compose arias with only your
name? symphonies in your key? puddlesplash. leafpile snuggle

Just got that _Diacritics_ and wanted to forestall a couple
misunderstandings --

While I am deeply grateful to J. Monroe for including my essay on Russell
Atkins's criticism, there are two points in Jonathan's introductory essay
that might mislead readers --

He opens with the remark that this issue "draws on presentations from two
events" at Cornell on 94 & 95 -- that is indeed true, but some of the
work, such as my own, is drawn from elsewhwere -- as in I was elsewhwere
hen those events happened -- My essay was not part of the conference &
symposia --

More imprtantly, at least to me -- on pg. 7 of his intro., Jonathan
refers to my having noted that "the most successful black poets have been
those, like Rita Dove and Derek Walcott, 'who write in more mainstream
modes [and] . . . whose forms are less troubling than their content'"
What I actually say on pg. 86 is that black poets "whose forms are less
troubling than their content"  might be more likely to attract a modest
increase in interest by publishers and readers in their critical works
(as opposed to somebody like Atkins) --  The claim as represented by
Monroe might prove to be true in the end, but it's not the claim I was making

But isn't this the Pound debate again?  Pound who said "A hundred yids
should die for every Fascist that falls" (in his taped ravings)?   All
of this is and must be on the record.  But who do we throw out as a
result of it?  Apparently only the poets we dislike (for whatever other
reason).  Those we find essential stay put.  Marjorie Perloff made what
should have been the final statement on this question--what was that
last zinger, "It can't be Love my Politics, love my poetry."  In
the anecdote above, Dorn's the bad guy, Jones/Baraka the good.  Yet
Jones/Baraka writes of "jewladies" himself, and "faggot handmaidens of
the french whore," and "some up and coming queer" (long before the word
achieved its in-your-face currency).  And I'm not even willing to part
with the poem in which he makes some of these references, the
coruscating "Politics of Rich Painters."  What I heard Anselm Hollo
objecting to was the tendency to make untouchables of our enemies, while
making excuses for our friends.  Please correct me, AH, if I'm wrong.

whoa, my adored rachel.  i don;t think writing "even dorn (god help us)" or
whatever aldon wrote, is "making an untouchable" of dorn.  i read it simply as
an offhand remark about something we all know: that dorn, while incontrovertibly
a major poet with good personal qualities as well as talent, is capable of
prejudicial attitudes and statements. to mention in passing, and with what i
took to be some humorous affection, something that is well known and that is not
pleasant is not, to my mind, an act of censorship.

some thoughts (over) heard: there was no 'tendency to make untouchables' of any
bodies rather the perspicacity to point out a bigots bigoty. no 'throwing out' did I
hear, but if one hears throwing out, it of course presupposes the white noise of the
'in' we are in.

No pound as the measure of in-ness (as in indictable co-conspiritor) here or heard,
rather the good sense to make the ineluctable political measurement of the propaganda of
the deed. a salutary measure of consciousness in the too vigorous search for tendencies
that rues the diminution of our better, poesy selves. Lets hope its not so easy to make
'final statements'.

1) My Valentine Poem

Tho often you at me are glowering
Tho your conceit is sometimes towering

Tho you sing sharp and flat while showering
Tho your persona's overpowering
& were mine less, you'd have me cowering
Tho Spec Collections has us rowing
in type no less, I sit here vowing
(while you, net-maidens keep on wowing)
when skies are blue or clouds are lowering
to keep this long-haul friendship flowering

2) Ed Dorn's _North Atlantic Turbine_ is an amazing book, as it was when it
first appeared. And there are earlier books: _Hands Up_, _The Newly
Fallen_, filled with moving poetry, hard-bitten/tender poems of love and
mourning, often with a political--but what we used to call "human"--edge to
them. _Gunslinger_ was a notable departure from the work of his first
decade of publishing. Some big change, announced with "Stand by the Door
Awhile, Death, there are Others" which i read as intermediary between the
early and the middle periods of this terrific poet.

As for bigotry--we have Aldon's indications, and wasnt an issue of his zine
_Rolling Stock_ full of taunting of AIDS sufferers? I'd welcome clarity on
that one.

3) Bob Perelman's poem: one might well say Wow. He came along like a
bottom-feeder and scooped up a lot of heavy matter very fast. Its an
exemplary act, it shows how the List can feed (neg or poz) poetry.

f.n. Bob, didnt know you were lurking--you put it to good use. Now I'll
tell you how to make a proper dash--depress "Shift" and "option" while you

Come on now guys, I know you're reading at least parts of this exchange --

No, it clearly does not boil down to one incident years ago -- I
mentioned the letter in response to remarks that appeared to dismiss
another incident as an isolated episode of conference table talk -- I
have no interest whatsoever in tracking any and all such remarks Dorn may
have made over the deacdes -- Somebody asked why there seemed to be
negative reactions to seom mentions of Dorn -- I indicated one reason
such negativity might exist -- My guess is that somebdoy who made similar
remarks years apart has probably made them on more than two occasions to
more than two people -- I could, of course, be wrong about that -- You
might ask Dorn his current opinion of Mencken's diary entries on the
subject of Jews -- perhaps Dorn has changed his opinion in the interim --
I would be pleased to learn that he has --

As to Pound debate redux -- I most certainly did not tell anyone to stop
reading Dorn -- quite the contrary -- Nor in any way does Jones/Baraka
come off as "the good guy" in my representation of the letter -- my
remark about "irony" was directed to the fact that one poet was
apologizing for something to another poet who was about to do the same
thing -- I am on record, here and elswhere, with my opinions about
antisemitism in Baraka's poetry of the cultural nationalist period, about
his criticism of his earlier antisemitism since he has become a Marxist,
and about the fact that he still reads poems in public from that period
without much comment about the change --

The system I've borrowed is about to shut off --

I am not going to defend myself for being offended by things that people
have said in public -- Nor will I let myself be classed with those
censorious folk who WILL tell you what not to read --

Olson said racism has to be kept at the end of a stcik -- he also
continued to read Pound  --

see y'all later on another topic

Although impercise in its appliction, a measure of certain
consciousnesses available in our present is the cliched 'kafka-esque',
over-abundantly used as an adjectival injunction to give order to 'our'
disordered lives. But the following is true:

 There is another michael corbin (same middle name too) who is a felon;
wanted for parole violation and failure to appear in court in the state
of michigan. this person also (for perhaps genetic or perhaps cosmic
reasons) met my general physical discription including the placement of a
small facial scar. This person's drivers license number very closely
approximated mine (close enough for a fine police officer to, perhaps
willingly, confuse them). And, clearly for some horoscopical reason, this gentleman had
my exact same date of birth.

The reason that I know of the existence of this literal out-law was, of course, that I
was thought to be him, by those who had an interest to know him and to get him (I have
never been to michigan I assure you and my crimes well . . .). Twice I was accosted by
the constabulary during self-conscious gestures of political civil disobedience
unrelated to this identity convergance (once against the storage of nuclear waste, the
other, unironically, at a demonstration agaisnt police brutality). When mis taken for
the michigan gentleman upon my arrest I was jailed until the state of michigan could
point out that I was not their man.

Twice more the constabulary engaged me. unfortantely, I was observed being excessive on
my motorcycle. On the final instance after 'they', as they say, 'ran my plate' I was mis
took  for a felon on the run (and speeding on a motorcycle no less). I was approached in
high-tabloid-television fashion by the constabulary, their firearms drawn, after I had
pulled sheepishly to the shoulder.

I know not if my hieroglyph has been apprehended. But as of this moment I remain at
large.

which reminds me of the marvelous anecdote in Our Lady of the Flowers of the
young thug who systematically denies being the one who committed a crime by
someone who looked just like him, had his date of birth, his name, his address,
but...wasnt him.  high camp and very charming, a break of hilarity in genet's

Dear Aldon: first, am distressed that I may have offended you.  Whole
snafu points up the limits of email, something I've often been lectured
on by resident logician who says it should be used for brief bulletins
and not to carry anything with emotional freight.  A simple act like
pressing the reply button makes it seem that I am talking to you alone
(rather than responding to the whole thread).  You weren't censoring and
I know that.  I've recently put the screws to Eliot (on another list)
for reasons very similar to the ones that made you highlight Dorn's bad
behavior.  Which is to say that stuff he said offended me greatly.  When
I said that there was a tendency to make untouchables of our enemies
while making excuses for our friends, I meant that that tendency was
mine as well.  But neither of us is suggesting censorship, and I don't
think that accusation is really anywhere in my post.

It seems possible--now that I think of it in the half-lunacy of 4 a.m.
--that the work of someone who is (even slightly) reviled may, in a
perverse way, attract more readers than it might have been able to pull
in otherwise.  I wonder how many people will pick up Dorn after this
discussion with new interest, for instance.  Who is this guy and how did
he get that way?  It's more the sort of mildly withering adjectives that
Ron Silliman used in his Zones v. Zoos post that might actually have the
power to shrink a potential readership, seems to me.  What could be
worse for a writer than to be perceived as timid or nostalgic, not to
mention achingly pretentious?  Now those are a real death knell.

How a person behaves -- what the person thinks, says and does -- ought
certainly to determine how one relates to that person -- what one thinks,
says, does in re: him/her. Any problems so far?

Writing -- that's thinking, saying, doing. Still with me?

Reading -- ditto. Are we on the same page?

Simple so far. Ed Dorn comes around me, I'll bust him one good in the chops
whatever his skills as a poet, whatever my friend Anselm thinks. No grand
zodiacs of correctness involved. You might want to read Rushdie's valentine
into this space.

What makes you think you can separate reading from ethics? Aesthete? You
imagine that writing and reading in the absence of ethics are anything but
"trade" to use Rushdie's term.

As to pointing out the contradiction in someone's work, that's certainly a
start, but it absolutely excuses the sayer if nothing else changes.

People keep imagining that someone can provide an exposition to resolve an
issue like this in some sort of theory, that there's some sort of path
through it. There is no intellectual resolution available to allow one to
consort with hateful behavior.

My father used to say "lie down with dogs, get up with lice." If you have
the time or strength or want to pick the lice off yourself, you're safe to
lie down with racists, anti-semites, queer-haters, fatwa-issuers,
collaborators with the Nazis, and the like. Perhaps it really won't do you
any harm? Perhaps it's really not objectionable? Perhaps the regime really
won't be as bad as they say? Perhaps it'd be okay to accommodate just for
the brief time the phenomenon is present? Perhaps, since so many feel so
comfortable in taking the ride, they  are not wrong after all. Juden heraus.

As I say, Dorn around me? Punch in the mouth.

a note of thanx to alan j. sondheim for the forwarded post on telegraph
technologies... i've heard these stories before, and it's nice to have some
formal sources to check out... my wife kass fleisher and i met online, so i
have a personal (and professional) interest in such stuff...

and i've heard too many stories about dorn, from too many folks who know
him too well, not to be aware of  problems with him personally &
politically... which is revealed in his public self, finally, b/c he *has*
a public self that's often *very* public... i don't think aldon was
suggesting that we don't read his work -- aside from _slinger_, _way west_
has some fine fine work in it, and if you've spent any time at all in
idaho, dorn's writing on same reveals a terrific touch...

so a call for us ALL -- pleez?  pretty pleez? -- not to get into these
testy waters looking for combat... if you know the man and like the man and
feel the urge to rush to his defense as a friend or acquaintance, give a
bit of pause -- you'll still have to contend with some pretty awful public
realities... yeah, maybe we're ALL pretty awful deep down inside, or not so
deep, but then i'd simply have to observe that, art aside, we ought to
reserve those moments for the intimate few who can tell us where to get
off...

apologies for the homily///

best,

According to the Oxford English Dictionary "Losh" is is a word which is
onomatapoetic in origin and means "to fall with a splash" or "to go
stumbling" as in "Yet am I not so sheepish to losh into the Ditch"
(1629).  It also is a "distortion of Lord, used in certain exclamations"
as in "The losh preserve me, sirs" (1779) or "Losh me! that's
beautiful language!" (1855).

Losh is a surprisingly rare name outside of Pennsylvania and most
people don't know quite how to pronounce it.  Whenever I am introduced at
a reading I write on a small slip of paper ("rhymes with GOSH"), as
people generally assume "rhymes with GAUCHE."

I suspect that it is a name of German origin as everyone in my father's
family is German American.  But my father insists that it isn't really from
"Losch" but rather "Loches," the picturesque French chateau in the Loire
Valley made famous by Joan of Arc and some rather grotesque stories about
its dungeon.  This year he was triumphant when, after tracing the family
genealogy back 350 years, he finally arrived at some French speakers who
were religious dissidents to boot.  I still believe that we are all
middle class Krauts and that all other etymologies are just wishful thinking.

"Losh" is also the title of a book from Charasse Press Incorporated,
Copyright 1975 by Brian Grieveson.  I believe that Losh is the Native
American heroine of the book who dies tragically at the end and who also
has a daughter named Losh.  The book is cryptically dedicated to "Losh
Roxanne."  The last line of the book is: "I love you, Losh"

Yes, Rachel, you read me right.

The term 'unforgivable' is not, I don't think, commonly used in a spirit of
"some humorous affection" (Maria D.).

But I suppose these "kick-the-dog" (or the Dorn) fits of righteousness ARE
excusable--especially considering our shared powerlessness in the face of the
corporate-feudal world government's brutality (so eloquently described in
Salman Rushdie's message).

everyone at work is totally wigged out and hysterical about nothing of

greetings all,

miekal & liaizon & i were blessed on valentine's day (a holiday which
like most others we usually ignore (except xmas which happens to fall on
miekal's birthday)).

at around 5:30 pm we looked outside our east window & saw the following
sight:

EIGHT CARDINALS PERCHED IN OUR SUGAR MAPLE - SEVEN MALES & ONE FEMALE!

in all my 40 years i've never seen more than three maybe four cardinals
together. but eight! the effect on me was one of awe, of sacredness, of
good omen, blessedness, almost a trippy feeling of having one's reality
strangely but pleasantly tweaked or shifted.  what a valentine's gift,
those live bright red splotches in the grey-brown winter branches on a
backdrop of white snow.  who needs poetry (or watercolors) when you've
got mother nature?

more miraculous if it'd happened in a city.. . glad to be out "in the
sticks"  [actually, we're at the milktruck frequented cross-section of
two county highways; there are street lamps shining out the west
windows...BUT, compared to any city i've been in lately, this is still
"the sticks"]

Subject:      Re: racism, racist poets

the way i usually think of it is that if a writer is blind, fool, and
dishonest enough to either believe, or, not believing, still become a
propaganda machine for racism, facism, oppression, torture, murder,
repression, etc (yes i AM including pound here) i find their entire
ouevre considerably less credible.  yes, as with elliott and his pathetic
anti-semitism, a writer might still have tremendous gifts which are only
tarnished by such behavior, but the gift IS tarnished, and i lose that
wonderous, celebratory sense when reading because i must pass everything
i read and every feeling of admiration through the considerable filter
of knowing the writer has been horrifically, at the least, misled.

to put it more succinctly, imagine reading tillie olson or that old
favorite, meridel leseuer; one lets go, accepts premises willingly, is
buoyed up on a respect and admiration verging on worship, learns, opens,
takes in an extraordinary synthesis of emotion, compassion, skill,
communication, immediateness, clarity... then imagine reading pound,
especially after hearing one of those whacked anti-semitic broadcasts.
you admire, but reluctantly.  you distrust what you admire.  you distrust

still enthusiastic in their support...

Has anyone on the list had a look yet at this new novel by Julian Rios,
_Poundomania_, that I see noted in this morning's _NY Times_ -- Sounds
fantastic, but, despite being a Dalkey Archive production, seems not to
have shown up in bookstores here yet --

AND while we're on the subject of innovative writing in Spanish, does
anyone have leads on more recent Spanish Language poets whose verse is as
interestingly put together as Rios's prose?  I've been a bit cut off
since moving away from a Spanish Language bookstore where they looked out
for me --

e -- if what you say is the case -- and for me it is -- then the converse
holds?...  i think it does... that is, if i really take to someone, i'm
that much more likely to WANT to like someone's poetry... which isn't to
draw any hard & fast lines, or connections, just to indicate again how the
person-al can inflect perceptions of product...

But there is a very real sense in which Pound was not "living with"
anything like the horrors of fascism--he was geographically isolated at
Rapallo, had no mail from the US during the war, and had a comfortable
buffered zone of privilege--a safe place from which to spout his bullshit.

As for Dorn, his public statements have been execrable in a number of
ways--in the early years of the AIDS pandemic he published some really
nasty anti-gay stuff. I don't think it would be skillful means for me, in
particular, to punch him in the mouth. But it doesn't exactly lead me to
spend my limited "disposable" income on his books, either. For me, the
Dorn issue is just a re-teaching of that truth: just because someone is
black, Latino, Asian, First Nations, queer, a poet, an innovative poet,
a leftist, whatever doesn't mean they're "cool."

I think it is bad when we exculsively mix moralistic tendencies with art.
I mean you can appreciate someone's politics and say 'wow, this person is
right on, and therefore is a good poet...but also can't someone just be
plain evil and be a great artist.  I think this is possible.  I think the
reader just has to work harder in knowing the in-and-out of that artist's
thinking and deal with it.  I don't know why an artist has to be on a
higher moral ground.

actually, i mix "moralistic tendencies" much less with art than with other
pursuits, such as friendship.  for instance, i enjoy reading william burroughs,
although he shot his wife.  althusser also killed his wife, and i teach his
ideas in class (not uncritically, though my critique does not solely rest on his
uxoricide). i doubt very much, though, that i could be friends with someone who
shot his wife.  of course, it depends on the circumstances; in both of these
cases, the guys were not in their right minds at the time, but still they were
doing something that seems somehow culturally condoned for guys who are not in
their right minds.  also, i'm not sure disliking someone's anti-semitism is a
moral issue; it seems more one of self-preservation and self-respect. btw, ezra
pound wasn't just a great poet who happened to be anti-semitic; his
anti-semitism was the substance not only of his poetry but of his life choices
and most passionate political public activities. i don't care much for pound.
now some folks would call genet an anti-semite for various reasons.  i have only
been able to find one anti-semitic statement in all of his oeuvre, which i
passionately adore. (though that one sentence makes me uncomfortable.)  how did
"morality" get mixed up in this discussion anyway?--md

ahhhhh joe!  we are back to taste are we...

yes, it is true.  and yet, isn't there that sickening disappointment we
have all known when we've met someone, and they've been great, talked
the great talk, walked the great walk, and then we look at their writing
and
KABAAM!
with the best will in the world, we cannot bring ourselves to think we
like it, or it's any good...

and the converse; someone who is a wretch as a person, dishonest, mean
spirited, manipulative, and they write like an angel...

but yes.  i think the source stains the message, or lifts it sometimes.

it is so tangled up, really.  you read donne, the sermons about giving
and giving up things for others, or herbert.  and it's all very nice and
good-good talk, you think, still, there's something really lovely but
then, then you find out that herbert relinquished the immense perks of
his class, time, position, to go off and care for a small country flock
against all advice for proferrment.  and the tender, humble, gentle
verse he writes, the simplicity and sympathy, resound so very much...
or donne, after his wild youth, and wilder marriage, and imprisonment
and hopeless poverty, and then he writes of what one renounces for love,
and a love bought dear, and you hear the brilliant urbanite scholar
crying out in each phrase against the poverty and obscurity and shame,
and that he can still hold to a tenderness, a valuing rather than a
bitterness, it is quite moving...

The poet whose works you love
Who's changed your life
& given it shape    & become a Great Moral Source
Of Support in your life
May just be a prick with a bad character
Don't let that worry you
They just have bad days all the time
If you're vulnerable to never wanting to read their works again
                           when you find that out
Then never go any closer to them than this
Because it's the works that are the truth
Every person has a right
Poet or not
                     to be judged by their best
The only credit poets get is for being poets
Then putting their words together        & coming up with poems

--------------------------

As an oldtime/oldfashioned, even, rootless ("we got legs, not roots")
cosmopolite of long standing, I personally regard all self- or
"identity"-definition based on "othering the Other" as a big mistake.  It
makes this species, all of us,  atavistically vulnerable to the pathological
fear and paranoia that often finds its expression in all kinds of forms of
scapegoating, racism, bigotry, etc.  Such brain function aberrations are
traditionally exploited by demagogues warlords and "business" and "religious"
"leaders."  It's a tough one; the propensity seems quite "hard-wired,"  hence
requires constant vigilance, first and foremost in regard to oneself.
 Paranoia is far more addictive than the old poppy juice.

Sweet dreams, and good morning

I would respond with a jaundiced eye and ear to Dorn's poetry if he had kept
his mouth shut for years but then I found out his true feelings later.  Honesty
in one realm is likely to be true in other realms.

I guess maybe that's the difference. I never read that way. I'm always
suspicious. In my experience, the categories of "learning" and
"worshipping" are exclusive of each other.

(Nor do I feel sure enough of my own purity to go around socking people

Subject:      a Persian diatribe / ..."Chaos--the Rock Video"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

Poetics persons --

looking via Yahoo for something else (as these things go), I stumbled
on a poetics-related diatribe by a certain Hakim Bey, a Persian chap
who has a number of opinions.  Found it here:

http://www.v2.nl/FreeZone/ZoneText/Diversions/Broadsheets/PornographyB
S.html

& there's an abstract:

>File Contents: Excerpt from Chaos: The Broadsheets of Ontological
>Anarchy by Hakim Bey. This document was gleaned from an excellent
>Hakim Bey source, Marius Watz's site, and was HTMLized by Tom
>Jennings.

The excerpt is entitled "Pornography" (poss. added by Jennings?, not
sure -- haven't looked at the orig. source) --

while Bey has various prejudices about contemp. western poetry, etc.,
I thought his observations about the way poetry is received in the
pan-Islamic world (or, anyway, the old Iran of his memory) to be
worthy of note -- the term *hal* (tossed out by Bey) being,
incidentally,  from the old Sufi lexicon, and signifying "a spiritual
state" (or sometimes a "state of absorption").

Am appending below what appears in the  above-cited excerpt, for
poss. general interest, amusement, shrugs, or whatnot.

cheers,
d.i.

p.s.: glancing at the "acknowledgements" note at end of the text, I
see that *The Broadsheets of Ontological Anarchism* are likely to be
already familiar to some readers of this Listserv.  Oh well -- just
tossing this morsel into the soup, for what worth.


/ / / / / / / / / / / /

Pornography

IN PERSIA I SAW that poetry is meant to be set to music & chanted or
sung--for one reason alone--because it works.

A right combination of image & tune plunges the audience into a hal
(something between emotional/aesthetic mood & trance of
hyperawareness), outbursts of weeping, fits of dancing--measurable
physical response to art. For us the link between poetry & body died
with the bardic era--we read under the influence of a cartesian
anaesthetic gas.

In N. India even non-musical recitation provokes noise & motion, each
good couplet applauded, "Wa! Wa!" with elegant hand-jive, tossing of
rupees--whereas we listen to poetry like some SciFi brain in a jar--at
best a wry chuckle or grimace, vestige of simian rictus--the rest of
the body off on some other planet.

In the East poets are sometimes thrown in prison--a sort of
compliment, since it suggests the author has done something at least
as real as theft or rape or revolution. Here poets are allowed to
publish anything at all--a sort of punishment in effect, prison
without walls, without echoes, without palpable
existence--shadow-realm of print, or of abstract thought--world
without risk or eros.

So poetry is dead again--& even if the mumia from its corpse retains
some healing properties, auto-resurrection isn't one of them.

If rulers refuse to consider poems as crimes, then someone must commit
crimes that serve the function of poetry, or texts that possess the
resonance of terrorism. At any cost re-connect poetry to the body. Not
crimes against bodies, but against Ideas (& Ideas-in-things) which are
deadly & suffocating. Not stupid libertinage but exemplary crimes,
aesthetic crimes, crimes for love. In England some pornographic books
are still banned. Pornography has a measurable physical effect on its
readers. Like propaganda it sometimes changes lives because it
uncovers true desires.

Our culture produces most of its porn out of body-hatred-- but erotic
art in itself makes a better vehicle for enhancement of
being/consciousness/bliss--as in certain oriental works. A sort of
Western tantrik porn might help galvanize the corpse, make it shine
with some of the glamor of crime.

America has freedom of speech because all words are considered equally
vapid. Only images count--the censors love snaps of death & mutilation
but recoil in horror at the sight of a child masturbating--apparently
they experience this as an invasion of their existential validity,
their identification with the Empire & its subtlest gestures.

No doubt even the most poetic porn would never revive the faceless
corpse to dance & sing (like the Chinese Chaos- bird)--but...imagine a
script for a three-minute film set on a mythical isle of runaway
children who inhabit ruins of old castles or build totem-huts &
junk-assemblage nests--mixture of animation, special-effects,
compugraphix & color tape-- edited tight as a fastfood commercial...

...but weird & naked, feathers & bones, tents sewn with crystal, black
dogs, pigeon-blood--flashes of amber limbs tangled in sheets--faces in
starry masks kissing soft creases of skin--androgynous pirates,
castaway faces of columbines sleeping on thigh-white flowers--nasty
hilarious piss jokes, pet lizards lapping spilt milk--nude break-
dancing--victorian bathtub with rubber ducks & pink boners-- Alice on
ganja...

...atonal punk reggae scored for gamelan, synthesizer, saxophones &
drums--electric boogie lyrics sung by aetherial children's
choir--ontological anarchist lyrics, cross between Hafez & Pancho
Villa, Li Po & Bakunin, Kabir & Tzara- -call it "CHAOS--the Rock
Video!"

No...probably just a dream. Too expensive to produce, & besides, who
would see it? Not the kids it was meant to seduce. Pirate TV is a
futile fantasy, rock merely another commodity--forget the slick
gesamtkunstwerk, then. Leaflet a playground with inflammatory smutty
feuilletons-- pornopropaganda, crackpot samizdat to unchain Desire
from its bondage.

In line with what Tosh Berman wrote (someone might be "just plain evil and
a great artist"..forcing a reader to "work harder to know the ins-and-outs
of that artist's work and deal with it").

Likely few member of the list are unfamiliar with it, but I still think
Bernstein's "Pounding Fascism," a chapter in A Poetics, is the best
illustration I know of the nuanced and tension-ridden work of "knowing the
ins-and-outs" of a body of poetry.  Short tho' it is, I've often refered
to this as the only indispensible piece I have ever read on Pound--the
thing I send people to who are trying to make sense of his abiding
weirdness.  Useful for understinding vital things about the Cantos as
poetry, as well as for addressing the issues we've been raising here.

Re: Pound Trial/Dorn Trial
>
Almost a year ago, during the last Pound trial, I posted the following on
trials from Milan Kundera's _Testaments Betrayed_. Because it took so long
to type out, I saved it. As I said at the time, I don't agree with
everything Kundera says any more than I agree with everything Pound says or
Dorn says, but I think this text provides a useful perspective, so I post
it again.

Dear Susan,

        Lovely to hear from you.  The way the list works I'm sure someone
has answered your request.  It's raining heavily here, hailstones all that
sort of thing.  I spent today at a seminar on classroom management.
Fortunately the keynote speaker was brilliant and she managed to redefine
the topic in the most interesting way.   Who'd have thought it could be done?

        Our cat's resting quietly in the downstairs bathroom, having had the
choperation today.  It's something I have mixed feelings about, but for that
poor cat testosterone seemed to be some kind of rocket fuel.  He kept
disappearing and arriving back days later looking very decrepit.

        I'll enclose a poem though I still haven't found and PNG ancestors.
It's just a question of going back far enough.

        Love,
        Randolph.

Spirals Dance

I think I prefer bottomless chaos,
where there is no plan, hidden or otherwise,
where for ten billion years a universe lay
swollen, unliving, without a soul,
and endlessly creative,
molecules in every possible place
forming, folding, touching, collapsing,
until, in a moment, the threshold was crossed.

And I sensed the weight of those
 who lost their footing in the storm
that makes trial pieces of us all.

And everyone I saw
at the apex of a pyramid,
teetering, fragile, the slightest slip
and they might never have made it anyway.
Even a comma.

Fragile, transitory, precarious,
yet how could you miss at every turn
the touch of life's own kiss?
upcurving ash tips trawling every breeze,
Tigris-Euphrates filigree
of nerve tissue in the flight of a bird.
Or from the squeeze-box of blue on a crust
to the samba band of dog rooting in a bin
the same riotous tune drenching every available place.

And at any point it could have been different,
multiple branches and fibres fingering
every particle of the body of the possible.
And every false start, every unexplored strand
winked and returned to emptiness.
Gone, only the illusion left that every line
in the sketches still on show was deliberate.

But, whatever way I put it,
I suppose I saw each living thing
as a  collection of collections
of tiny dead spheres
restlessly combining and dissociating.

And even if iron atoms aren't dead,
nor made or iron,
or even if each one is a ferment of paradoxes
without which my heart would not beat,
how can I avoid slipping through a lattice
that offers no foothold for a human self?


Am I here at all?
At the garden exhibition,
dragons' necks swooping and curving,
boas of white bells, crystalline repetition,
disappeared and were replaced
by a landscape of little magnets
attracting, repelling,
lining up with the nearest field,
domains then collapsing under thermal assault,
summing over time to nothing.

Is life alive?
its roots reaching into submicroscopic worlds
where entities exist simultaneously
in arrays of mutually excluding states,
matter itself its breath
attenuated to near, but never, zero.

Or not?
Choose,
if a wave of waves can decide on its own shape.

Tuesday.
Are my thoughts my own?
Neither the world nor its representative replies.
Simple, complex, directed, chaotic?
No answer.
Whatever passes for pattern can be accommodated
as part of a larger random sequence
or result of any of an arbitrary set of laws.
Choose,
and/or take the consequences.

I used to think nature shrank from our touch,
enveloping us in a cocoon of ideas,
every love narcissism,
and hatred a war with oneself.

I don't know what I will think tomorrow.

Even a comma.

And if we are poised on the edge of a scalpel
so is the universe.
The smallest change in Newton's gravitational constant
and stars could not form;
and should the charge mass ratio of the electron
or Planck's constant waver neither atoms nor us.

As if, too, preceding, surrounding this universe
are, were, will be shoals of others,
outside any line or progress,
the mutilated, empty, capable only of spasms,
side by side with the classically profiled,
tone-deaf unreason hammering on every key.

When I heard the expression
"We're all in the same boat"
I took it to mean that we're all in the same kind of boat,
a flotilla of indistinguishable, isolated tubs.
It never occurred to me that it could mean one great craft,
with all the nautical camaraderie which that suggests.

We could be alone,
this universe a die
with everything staked on one toss,
its scale alone ensuring that one planet, one,
whose loss would be no more matter
than an atom falling from your body,
would be a grace note in the immense silence.

Poised.

My daughter is making faces at me through the window
because I wouldn't buy her chocolate,
she standing between her reflection and her shadow.
Present.
And I see a vast double pyramid
expanding into past and future
meeting where the spirals dance
and the mad and sturdy music registers again.

These reminders found in reading Ralph Maud's _Charles Olson's Reading_:

"Olson did not visit Pound after February 1948; he was sick of the man,
finally.  An irresistable moral force was asserting itself . . . That the
interest in Pound's work did not wane is reflected in Olson's
library."

" . . . Cagli had brought back the biggest and most ghastly news of all
time in the form of drawings he had made at Buchenwald when his artillery
unit had opened up the camp: 'the first to look into that compost of
civilization.'  Olson's poem, 'La Preface,' commissioned by Cagli for the
brochure of the New York and Chicago showings of the drawings, was the
poet's attempt to resist the utter resistance of this knowledge in such a
way that from that stop he might know a new beginning--"


"Cagli and Riboud . . . taught him 'the way a man comes to core . . . the
discovery of his own resistance . . . the way a poet--at least--makes
himself of USE to society.'"

Yes, I agree about the Bernstein piece.  I'd also recommend Jerry
McGann's essay, "The Cantos of Ezra Pound, the Truth in Contradiction"
(from *Towards a Literature of Knowledge*), one of the first pieces to
take on these issues seriously.  And more recently, there's Perelman's
Pound chapter in *The Trouble with Genius*.  Also extremely useful.

First of all, to make clear what I might have left unclear, I thought Aldon
was on the money not to be drawn into the issue of "who owns the correct
point of view." I have no desire to be drawn into it either. I'm sorry
Maria Damon doesn't "share (my) complete lack of ambivalence on this
score," to the degree that the phrase is an accurate characterization. I
should say that I'm not seeking Ed Dorn out or calling him out to give him
the ass-kicking he so richly deserves and so expressly has asked for --
that would be unambivalent. I'm just saying that I don't tolerate that kind
of bullshit around me. If everyone did no more than that the case would be
covered would it not?

As to Anselm's (if jdhollo@aol.com be his address -- the post is unsigned)
excusing "fits of righteousness" (i.e. attacks on Dorn's racism) in the
name of "our shared powerlessness in the face of the corporate-feudal world
government's brutality" let me say first that I adore Anselm as person and
poet and second, sorry, that's a lot of hoohah.

You either do or do not hold a position like Ed Dorn's or the
Persian-Fatwa-issuer. The fact that you don't have the power to enslave (or
even employ) lots of people doesn't turn your bile into Bal a Versailles.
Perhaps Khomeini never intended to act on his Fatwa; it's had its effect
hasn't it? Anyway. Ed Dorn can't whip blacks on a chain gang, and he can't
turn his anti-semitism into anything very effective either. That's good --
for me, I mean. It ain't a fact in his defense.

Some time in the late fifties, stepping to a podium to give a reading in
Germany, Paul Celan found a crudely-drawn anti-Semitic caricature on a slip
of paper left on the podium -- left for him to find. That caricature is the
visual equivalent of Dorn's "Jew-baiting" (his words). Of Pound's whining
bathetic spew. Of Eliot's prim dismissals. It is no different from David
Duke for that matter.

Wake up. Every word spoken is spoken by someone to someone. If you can't
take it in at that level, your interest in one thing and lack of interest
in another is of no value. Rather, it is of the value of choosing a color
of paint that goes well with the upholstery you prefer.

Dear Randolph--in fact, no one took it upon themselves to forward your
message back to me, so I'm very glad that you yourself responded.  I loved
the description of your cat and the choperation.  And I like your poem very
much.  Is your comment about PNG status a hint that my Tinfish might consider
it?
I'm still on sabbatical, and very vague.  But it's very nice to be back in
Hawai'i, where one can be vague in the sun and by the surf.  Buffalo was too
much grunge and freeze-burn.
There's a strong chance I'll be going to England in late April or early May.
 I'd love to travel to Ireland to catch a glimpse of those O'Keefes of mine.
 Might I look you and yours up for dinner?  On me (if it happens)!
I'm also glad that someone has brilliant ideas about teaching.  The more the
merrier!
aloha, Susan
PS  My friend Becky, whose book you signed, will be glad of your
re-discovery.

First, a question (out of sheer laziness)--
Where is the O'Hara poem (or is it not a poem) in which he speaks of poetry

Second, all that push pull stuff (is it dialogue yet?) and,

Most artists are just like other people, only worse.  Their obsession with
their work draws them away from people & into the labyrinth of dreams and
vanity and illusion.  Because they are worse than usual, people make
excuses for their behavior, even romanticize it.  Until the day comes
when they have to appear before the tribunals and go to jail for their
immoralities personal and artistic.
    The fact that their best and freest gifts and impulses go into their
work fortunately saves the work itself and wins people over far and wide,
just as it should. And occasionally the work acts as a good influence on
the lousy artist too.   - Henry Gould

With these words from Anselm Hollo...

"As an oldtime/oldfashioned, even, rootless ("we got legs, not roots")
cosmopolite of long standing, I personally regard all self- or
"identity"-definition based on "othering the Other" as a big mistake.  It
makes this species, all of us,  atavistically vulnerable to the pathological
fear and paranoia that often finds its expression in all kinds of forms of
scapegoating, racism, bigotry, etc.  Such brain function aberrations are
traditionally exploited by demagogues warlords and "business" and "religious"
"leaders."  It's a tough one; the propensity seems quite "hard-wired,"  hence
requires constant vigilance, first and foremost in regard to oneself.
 Paranoia is far more addictive than the old poppy juice."


I am completely in accord. He is especially right about the hard-wired
part, as we see worldwide in this here enlightened age of ours. True also
are the words in his poem, to the effect that we have the right to be
judged by what is best about us and the best we've done. We can make that
easier for folks, of course, by not spewing racist garbage as the other
part of the mix!

I am interested in reading McGann's thing--thanx for mentioning it...and I
agree about the Perelman Pound essay, which I decided was one of the few
other useful treatments I'd seen, when I read that book a year ago.
It was a pity that I felt obscurely irritable about the rest of it--the
discussion of Joyce felt too standard-academic, and the chapters on
Zukofsky and Stein really made me uncomfortable, as they seemed to
belittle the work of each on the grounds that it was hopelessly diminished
by the poets' lack of "social location" (i.e. a meaningful audience and
social role to work within)... That judgment seemed to me off-target.  As
regards Pound, I have to admit to having just read Perloff's "The
Contemporary of Our Grandchildren" in Poetic License, and now have another
first-rate essay to cite (not being an acadmic, I spend long amounts of
time reading little but poetry, and then in sudden spasms catch up with
criticism/theory I've missed).

It's unusual (I may be wrong about this) that a poet publicly declares his
intention to slug another poet in the chops.

I've read some of Dorn's poetry. It didn't rouse my fighting instinct.

Would someone (Aldon Neilsen? Tom Mandel?) mind taking the time to explain in
more detail what it is Dorn may have said (in public only, please) to piss
people off?


Also, while I'm making demands, I was wondering, Ron Silliman, if you would
elaborate on why you liken Eliot Weinberger ("the AntiGroup politics they
pursue. Which has an interesting political edge to it, especially when as in
Eliot's case it comes across sounding ultraleftist with an echo of Pat
Buchanan") to a Buchanan echo? cannon echo? canon echo?

Hi Chris --

The passage you're thinking of is, I think, at the end of O'Hara's
essay piece "Notes on _Second Avenue_."  It's in Collected Poems, p. 497:

"As I look this over, it seems quite a batty way to give information about
the poem, but the verbal elements are not too interesting to discuss
although they are intended to keep the surface of the poem high and dry,
not wet, reflective and self-conscious.  Perhaps the obscurity comes in
here, in the relationship between the surface and the meaning, but I like
it that way since the one is the the other (you have to use words) and I
hope the poem to _be_ the subject, not just about it."

Hope that helps!

Take care,

Andrew Epstein

for that matter, I, too, am out of the loop on this --

(I'd read some fiction Dorn wrote once, have heard of the guy
vaguely, and have a notion he's ensconsed w/ the Naropa School
more or less) --

but this seems bit like having somehow missed news of WW III

so, some note of background, kindly?

Eliot Weinberger has an appropriately indignant discussion of this in
_Words on Paper_ (as far as I remember, Rolling Stock "awarded" infection
for sundry "poetry crimes"--what they were I can't recall, but along the
lines of "praising the work of Joanne Kyger and Stephen Rodefer", etc.)

Anselm--just back from my jaunt to Baja and days of unimaginable salty bliss
to find all manner of fun stuff in my emailbox. Old hat by now, but I'd like
to put my two cents in. I think you and others have misunderstood Ron
Silliman's comments, which I quote below. I can see why you might be
incensed: on the surface Ron appears either to assume that what he says is
self-evident or to be indulging in gratuitous provocation--equally childish
and arrogant mind-sets, typical of that phase of adolescent individuation in
which self is defined in opposition. But is it not possible that what we
have here is deliberate self-parody? If it is, we have been invited to be
present at the emergence of a new level of wisdom--the development of an
observing ego--and we can only applaud Ron's generosity in allowing us to be
there.

But as for those appropriative galoots who claim that we're all part of
their herd if we do langpo-type stuff (as if the 20th century and a good
part of the 19th were his own personal rangeland), out west where you and I
live they call buckaroos who brand whatever cattle happen to be around
rustlers, and the hanging judges don't care much for theory as an excuse.

On the subject of poor Dorn and even poor Pound, your eloquent poem speaks
volumes. I'd just like to add a few names from various hit lists to stir the
dust a bit.
What do we make of Spicer's line, gratutous in context, about a "New York
jew salesman of amethyst pyjamas?" Are we allowed to read Celine, Maurois,
Giono, Montherlant (add any number of French writers)? Brecht, Picasso,
Rodin and Williams were in various ways unpleasant to their wives and
girlfriends, and Gesualdo killed his wife. Degas was an antisemite. Frieda
Kahlo, that somewhat improbable heroine, was by any standards a "difficult"
woman, and would have been even if she'd had a more abstemious husband.
Dickenson and Smart were more than a little over the edge. And let's not
forget Leni Riefenstahl (I'm sure I missed the spelling on that one). At
what point are all these folks so beyond the pale that they take their work
with them? Or do we recognize the flaws, grit our teeth and learn, even
become enriched, despite the fact that we might not feel comfortable at that
cocktail party?

Now that I've made this list, it occurs to me that this group of the
difficult, demented and disreputable may be a school, even though most of
these folk had a sentimental attachment to the notion of the loner.

Best to the missus.



Consider, for example, that non-group posed by Forrest Gander. Several
of the folks on that list--Taggart, Cole and Sobin, say (and to some
degree Palmer)--all share enough features to compose a group of their
own except that the Loner status with all its aching pretentiousness is
one of its major preconditions. All of them are male second generation
Black Mountain poets whose work is notably more timid than that of
their elders. And all of them are too much in love with a certain
codified sense of Beauty, tho it plays out in very different ways from
person to person (except that for all it comes across as some variant
of nostalgia). We could build a slightly larger circle here and toss in
some other folk who fit the category, such as Augie Keinzhaler, George
Evans, Eliot Weinberger. What keeps these folks from being a group is
precisely the AntiGroup politics they pursue. Which has an interesting
political edge to it, especially when as in Eliot's case it comes
across sounding ultraleftist with an echo of Pat Buchanan.

Another cluster of writers who could be legitimately grouped would be
poets who were trained ("educated" in the most literal sense) within
the academic poetics of the free verse '60s mode who have sometimes
been associated with langpo, largely because they have very lively
minds and can't keep their work from having lots of snap and pop at all
points: Gander himself is an example, as are C.D. Wright, Jorie Graham,
Ann Lauterbach and Bob Hass. These writers (and here is where Palmer
would come in again) have a more complicated relation to questions of
community and tradition and a very ambivalent stance toward innovation.

Those of you working in the computer industry might have a harder time
getting hold of the source here, but listmembers in the academy should be
able to track it down w/ relative ease: the current (February 21, 1997)
issue of The Chronicle of Higher Education has an article about the MFA
program at Syracuse, complete w/ tales of a poet throwing Scotch in the
face of a graduate student and calling her a "stalinist bitch." My favorite
part is the pictures of 4 writers. They all look like they're posing for
their dust jacket photograph. Is that a part of the curriculum at MFA
programs these days?
        Anyway, the article is entertaining when it shows the various
writers at each other's throats, but it's also disturbing to see the
manipulation of students that seems to be commonplace, if the article is to
be believed.
        Read it and weep (or laugh, depending on your disposition).

Now,,,, is it really all that difficult to understand that I might talk
about Dickinson's poetry with my students and also talk about this part of
her thought?  One conversation helps us to understand something about her
poetry -- the other conversation helps us, perhaps, to understand
something about our culture that we probably need to understand as much as
we need her poetry -- The irony in her poetry and in this letter might
even help us to comprehend the ironies of our own history --  who is

Artists are like other people, only worse? Oh geez, Henry. I thought
artists were other people. Some bad traits, good traits, etc. Artists are
more likely to dream? Geez, these days they're more likely to be excellent
business people, holding a regular job, doing their work as an artist,
having families too sometimes and not even necessarily beating them or
being addicted to drugs. I mean, really, the only thing worse than being
ordinary is being romanticized, even if in the negative.

Dorn and Tom Clark seemed to think that AIDS was a topic of humor.
They nominated various infamous people for the award which consisted
of an injection of the AIDS virus. This done to the lurid graphic
of a dripping hypo. I wrote them at the time and told them that
I didn't think it was funny. I asked Dorn after a reading what he
was thinking of. He was not cordial <g> and refused to talk about it.

Hardly. He lives in Boulder, but teaches at CU. Check out Tom Clark's _Naropa
Poetry Wars_ (or somesuch) to find out why he doesn't hang with the
Disembodied crowd.

I think soemone already mentioned this, but there was an issue of his
magazine, Rolling Stock, in the  80's full of vicious AIDS jokes & anti-gay
sentiment. Lost my respect then. Sad. I still like the early work &
_Gunslinger_. The one time I heard him read, he was too drunk.

Well, the most important artist of "our generation" (listening, Mickey
Mouse Club members?) I know personally is Jack Spandrift, the hard-drinkin
tough-talkin po-yeti from Brainerd MN.  That proves it.  Did you read
his egregious attack on Fellow-Poet Dorn?  I'm embarrassed to be associated
with a list that would include such a person.

And furthermore, I tink I said in my fust post that people romanticize
artistic "badness" in a very very bad way. I don't really think artists
are wuss than other people, I was just tryin to rhetoroarically counteract
the moralist front.  This ain't to say I don't agree completely with
Aldon that Emily Dickinson's scorn of me Irish furfathers is relevant
to the Historical Taste-Building nekessary here & everywhere, & with
Mandel, Tom, that slugs must not cower under the rug in the face of
rampant bigotry.  Oh no!  Let slugs emerge!

Poets aren't worse than other people.  It's just that people in general
are so BAD that any predilection for expression-obsession tends to
drag the lame foot over the ground and leave the said poet unstaid.

Since this is my first posting I would like to say hello to all of you and
to thank Charles Bernstein and the State University of New York at Buffalo
for making this important access possible. Although I was not on-line when
several reviews of my new book Light Street from Zasterle Press appeared
(2/12-2/14) I was delighted when I did see them and I am very
appreciative. Special thanks to Henry Gould, Charles Alexander, Tom Beard,
Fred Muratori and to my good friends Mark Wallace, David Bromige and
Douglas Messerli. As was mentioned in several of the postings concerning
Light Street and my other books, Zasterle Press, edited by Manuel Brito in
the Canary Islands, is a terrific press and has included- since 1994- such
books as The Whole Note by Gill Ott, a collaboration by Alan Davies with
the photographer M.M. Winterford, Acoustic Masks by Ted Pearson, The
Weatherman Turns Himself In by Leslie Scalapino, Keys To The Caverns by
Clark Coolidge, and Train of Thought by Jack Spicer. Earlier books include
those by Charles Bernstein, Carla Harryman, Barrett Watten, Ray DiPalma,
Bruce Andrews, the late Jerry Estrin and the late Daniel Davidson.

is it just lil old me trying to "save the appearances" or is there a
Swiftian ring to Dickinson's sentiments re my people? (I am not actually
descended from irish stock, but since the whole world wants to be, it wd be
egregious of me to exclude myself).

Aldon. And good on you, Mark W, for taking the kidding so well. I had some
bad moments during the night, feeling i had shown my less-than-charitable

heedless on Diet 7-Up and Manchego cheese, I dont reveal the names--and
they are of many nations--of all those poets I had throttled & dumped in
the river. Weird percussion aids, end-rime, end-runs around beautiful

Let it go, Dave.  Aunt Spurl had it coming, anyway.  I've included your
sestina, "Turkey Time for Stuffed Shirts" (with a few editorial downgrades)
in my upcoming anthology, _Dribble Down the Line : Odiferous Poets of the
90s_ (Cowboy Laundry Press, POB 13, Small Town, Wyo 11174).  It's due out
next week.  You don't mind I used it, do you?  Thanks. p.s. the books's only
$39.95, prepaid only, please.
- Jack Spandrift
p.s. no, you "Poets" out there - don't get your hopes up.  YOU ARE NOT
IN THIS ANTHOLOGY!!!

I always consider a sentence of death by scientific education to be
Swiftian in nature -- I also have always imagined that modest proposals
for the eating of one's "own" people have a slightly different "taste"
than proposals that others should be devoured -- If for no other reason
than that the self is nearly always excluded from the sentence passed upon
even one's own -- though a modest proposal for autoingestion WOULD seem to
set a new standard for modesty as well as irony --

well, now I see that I finally have come down on the side of taste after
all -- to quote that great poet Slinger Francisco: "I never ate a white
meat yet!"

are we past the fifty mark yet?

And please remember the following from Charles Bernstein's list of rules
for the POETICS list:
all irony
(including sarcasm, schtick,
mocking, jokes, and comic innuendo)
will be prohibited from the list.
This is a particularly difficult rule
to enforce automatically, but recent,
unpublishable, research, indicates
that there may be genetic markers of
sarcasm and our team of crack(ed?) computer
experts are working around the clock
to find programs to detect this "irony
gene" in linguistic expression.

[nb: Bernstein uses "genetic" in both its linguistic and its biological
senses here, obviously way ahead of his time once more in predicting a
major portion of the "Ebonics" debate -- the comma that appears after the
word "research" is, in fact, a genetic marker of irony, and statistical
analysis indicates that there is only a 1 in 50 million possibility that
anyone other than Charles Bernstein could have left this marker at the
scene -- lastly, for those of you who have recently inquired about the
seemingly absent Loss, he is completing the irony detection program at a
secret off-campus s(c)i(gh)te.]

Just had dinner with a group that included three other subscribers to the
list. The subject of some recent threads came up, and I homed in on what I
have found disturbing. I would guess that we all have a few opinions that
others might find odd--even me. If I present mine in the form of dismissive
adjectives that I expect everyone to agree with I don't invite the
possibility of discussion, and I don't offer any enlightenment. I could,
instead, treat the poet an aspect of whose work I find offensive with some
respect, enlarging on what I find problematic, and presenting chapter and
verse. No one may agree with me, but at least they'll understand my
rationale and have the option of engaging with it. Not a bad goal for a

I still know nothing of Dorn and Clark's politics and feelings.  I feel I
need some example of their work..  So far it seems to be two men who have
either a dark sense of humor or a sense of irony, or perhaps just evil.
Whatever, I still think that a writer's work should be judged on his work
and not his life, racism, or politics.  For all I know they may have
regrets for their comments.  I just don't know.  Perhaps they're wasted on
their own problems, again I don't know.  What we do know is their work (if
we read it) and that is what we should be commenting on.

Of course I just had three glasses of red wine, so what do I know...

yours,

or maybe this should subjected
        most artists are worse people than artists.
i feel i come out best in my art, more principle, more vision and
intelligence. dan raphael the poet is a lot more interesting, perceptive and
balanced a person than my regular world self.
can you separate the person form what they produce? yes and no.
i feel that to do intense and moving art you are working some edge of
subconscious. perhaps then you are doing other work to support yourself. or
because you cant conventionally support yourself you work some edges of
health, sanity, substance misuse. the quality of the art does not directly
correspond with how well the person reacts to various ethical and spritual
demands of day to day life.
i am not making excuses, just saying that a persons maturity, karma and
general focus may not directly relate to the quality of er work.

How nice, when the DIGEST FORM is small enough so I don't have to download
and then later sign back on, etc. (a rare day)

This may address (not answer) some of Jordan's questions
("where was the emphasis in some trees? were cliches a tragedy?"):
one thing that might be said about a line like
        "No more odes, the dood doctor said,
         come in with something distressing"
is that it is another one of Ashbery's many "I got your PRESCIPTIVE GAME
number" to Harold Bloom, your "ruin the sacred truths shit attempt to elevate
WORDSWORTH and retract on BLAKE ("skyscrapers going up to the sky, people
going down to the ground"--dylan) and all the ideological
implications---remember Bloom WAS a radical in the 50's and early 60's and I
am grateful to him for the fact that Shelley was part of my undergrad
curriculum in a way, say, Beddoes was not--despite smug Benjy Brown (god rest
his soul?) who divided Shelley's phases up into "Mad Shelley" "Anarchist
Shelley" "Atheist Shelley" etc. Fuck him, he was a Shakespearean. Whatever
that meant. I dropped the course to take my 6th with the guy who turned me
onto the beats, Brackhage, Fassbinder and Bloom (last time I saw him he told
me he felt guilty for teaching the visionary company all these years and got
some NEW book on the romantics, perhaps edited my McGann i forget don't quote
me and how it just seemed so bland (article in this week's NEW YORK PRESS on
creative writing departments (fiction but could be applied to poetry too) "Am
I bland enough"?---
So I was a lopsided englsh major but I wanted to ask Jerome Rothenberg if
he'd sanction my hunch I mean theory
(IN MEMORY OF MY HUNCHES,hmmmm, coming soon to a NO BOOK near you) that they
felt betrayed by Bloom as he began leaning like the tower of PISA away from
the prison which OLSOn took from pound and towards the James Merrill and May
Swenson (not fur person Sarton) side of Ashbery instead and one of the RIFTS,
like the developing rift between AM and FM music around the same time, the
center not being able to hold after "some folks are born silver spoon in
hand, lawd don't they help themselves, y'all" and even stevie wonder more POP
than HIP (he bible, they say--Cixous, Dickinson) and "can't the bad guy win
every once in a while" reached #1 (smirched, worm-eaten) but it didn't matter
(STAIRWAY TO FREE PEARL BIRD JAM FOORBALL) and so he could claim the
authority of BLAKE et al and put it in MERWIN (even as he could still be
perceived as a radical who broke down STULTIFYING ACADEMIC PERIODIZATION
(helen liked when I was in that groove) even though he (I'm still talking
BLOOM)  had to use FREUD (UGHHHHHHH!) to do so and already turned his back on
emerson and in this sense followed the fashion as much as he made it so the
FREUD-WORDSWORTH SIDE won out (evident in his emphasis on Tragedy in his
recent Shakespeare) and McWorkshops fed it and the PAST GREW more distant and
   THE MAINSTREAM broke with tradition de facto
    if not de jure
   THE AVANT GARDE broke with tradition de jure but not
    de facto.
   Is the distinction between Bukowski and Berrigan really
   that great? (I mean there' a perspective in Bukoski and
    Berrigan and Marvin Bell are the same, or is that just
    a reductive reading of the "language poetry"?)
    How petty! Yes, Harold, poets are characters in a play
    (she is anyway--flipside is better)--but WHICH play?
    "UH, DUH, THE PLAY OF SIGNIFIERS"
     Right answer, but out of character.
     Remember your stake in pathos.
    It's your responsibility for us confessionals lop-
    sided in the human pole of myth. Our stock is
    dropping without you. Your stock may drop without us,
    but only to those who still think MALLS are disgusting
    (guiliani spar, editor of K-MART, a CHAIN mag)
    and we'll let them play to the youth market
     (elvis needs boats--latest routledge catalogue?)
    THE AUDACITY of the MLA holding a special session
    whose main purpose was to determine whether
    CULTURAL STUDIES is dead." Is anything else ALIVE?
     PROVE IT. hire me.
     I know a woman (email solely) named Lisa Kenyon
     who couldn't even get her PUNK MUSIC panel accepted
     last year. How did Gillian McGain pull it off?
     (uh oh the town vs. gown thread could be triggered
      by this one) and Jameson appeals to thre AUTHORITY
      of GANG OF FOUR and TALKING HEADS (like the way
      Ulysses abuses poor Achilles, according to Thersities
      at least, who IS a reliable observer in this case)
     and I'm so SICK of the canonization of CHINA--
     almost everything in THE FIRST WORLD, FACE VALUE and
     C.A. is better (r.i.p. pig xiaping---to be "credited" for
     "market economy" which is the same as the tomkin
      square crackdown) and I'm also noticing (but not
       necessarily sick of) the canonization machinery
       surrounding Bernstein's (or should I say Charles')
      LINE poem and
       I'm WITH YOU IN ROCKLAND (rockville)
       all of you who were disappointed by the fact that he
       (Jameson) didn't talk about the HEADS or the GANG
       (no one I know calls them that, though when me and
        George acted out "we all have good intentions but all
        with strings attached" to make a mockery of "air-
        guitar" night Andy wrote us up as "disjointed chrysanth-
        emums swaying in the wind") or that Clint Burnham
        didn't let himself talk about P.J Harvey or Pavement
        enough (allegedly Christgau in this week's voice talks
       about Ashbery's influence on PAVEMENT--I gotta get)
      (and why did JONI MITCHELL recently express her disgust
       with poetry? Would she have said this 20 years ago?)
       "as serious artists deserving of close readings"
       and cultural studies is not a term in the ode-distressing
       polarity with which I started. Bloom ignores it
       largely. Ashbery doesn't at places. So is this just a
       parlour game?-----
       (to post this to the whole list would be a kind
         of "he's always making love to the whole world" (sic))
       Thank you Andrew Epstein for notes on Second Ave.

Well, folks, it's time to saddle up Old Whither, me & my unshakable sidekick
Spandrift are riding out.  The fare's too rich, I need to fast for a while.
Some of us like the sound of our own e-voice; now the aftertaste of my own
wretched chatter & puerile comments leaves me sick at heart.
  I understand this is a mixed medium & a friendly home away from home, yet
as one of the worst offenders I applaud those with some restraint - here's
to honest questions and comments on matters of substance!
  It's hard to resist, especially for a day-jobber; Jack says "count me out
buddy", but I myself may be back someday soon as a lurker.  See if I ain't!
  Sincere thanks to all kindly spirits & intelligent pals, this is a
remarkable corner of the litewawy woods.
  Please don't email any condolences etc.!  I'm still at Henry_Gould@brown.edu
for reasons d'etat or so on.
   For those of you whom it pleaseth to sow the wind, I leave you with a note
from an old cell-mate of Jack's name of El Bardo:
But when I came alas! to wive, / With a hey, ho, the wind and the rain, /
By swaggering could I never thrive, / For the rain it raineth every day.

This thread has been very important for me.  I didn't know
anything--literally--about Dorn as a person prior to the conversation on
this list, although I had read and like what I have read.  And I have never
seen a discussion in print of the quotation below that Aldon Nielson quoted
from Dickinson.

These are serious issues--not just because I have both Irish and Jewish
greatgrandparents (as well as British and German and Hungarian and Czech
ones).  But because they speak loudly about our own education(s) and
culture--as Nielson says.

My professional training is as an Anglo-Saxon scholar, although I left the
field before finishing the final degree.  One of the most valuable things I
have ever done, though, is a close reading of the emendations and footnotes
of various 18th, 19th and early 20th century editions of Anglo-Saxon texts.
The 19th and 20th century editions of _Beowulf_ are used by these editors
(and by some of the scholars who based their work on these editions) up to
the time of WWII to make the argument that the germanic race was genetically
superior.  The places where these arguments get made in Beowulf are situated
around holes in the text -- literal holes in the text, where the ms. was
burned or cut or cannot otherwise be read now.  Early editors of the AS
texts would fill in these "holes" with their own emendations, and then shore
up their "emendations" with cultural explanations of how the text, the poem,
works to make that particular emendation the only proper emendation.

The question of how one reconciles (or doesn't) the relation between persons
(writing or reading) and texts is wrapped up in all kinds of theoretical,
textual and philosophical debates.  The question of how one reconciles (or
doesn't) the relations between persons and persons, nations and persons, is
even more difficult.  There's no simple way to talk about the ways that an
Anglo-Saxon scholar may have "shored up" colonialism as systematic political
and cultural oppression by his or her emendations of a phrase in Beowulf.
After Auschwitz (to quote another thread months past) it seems better to
address the issue than to sweep it under the rub. rug, I meant.

Daily I wonder in what ways my own limitations, assumptions, inabilities,
failures--my own unacknowledged or unknown immersions in our culture(s)--get
inscribed into my writing or into my reading.  How I use the body of the
text as my own body.  autoingest?  or others bodies.

Will I eat my words.  cuts.  these holes.  poems.  her poetry.  need as
well.  as need. our.  us.  conversation.

That Emily Dickinson participated in some of the less appealing aspects of
the culture of Amherst, Massachussets, then, as now (despite the heavy
academic layer imposed upon its essential redneckedness) is only surprising
because we have made her into a saint--far less surprising, at any rate,
than finding out what Mabel Loomis Todd and big brother were doing under the
dining room table while Emily and Sis covered for them (did she stand in the
doorway in her prim white dress and watch?). As a cultural artifact the
guilty letter tells us that Yankees didn't like Irish, as if this needed
further confirmation. It doesn't enter into the oeuvre. Now, a critique
could be worked up about what gets included and what not in the poetry, and
from there to what the unstated purpose of poetry was seen to be by Miss D
and her coevals, and that would be an interesting discussion regardless of
who its focus--I think we all, despite the huge broadening of the field
accomplished for us by the surrealodadaists, Olson, Pound, Williams, etc.,
tend to segregate our opinions and concerns to one extent or another into
poems, prose, email, dinner conversation, letters to the editor, etc., and
the choices and mechanisms thereof are at the heart of practice. If I say I
write by "dictation" in whatever way I mean that, how do I explain that my
radio angels or ghosts push some products more than others? This exploration
around the edge of practice being in fact a central concern of my own
practice. But for her own reasons, unlike Pound, say, as Yussl Rothenberg
has pointed out, it doesn't enter into ED's poems. Not ED Ed Dorn, not ED
Lady in White.
Look, I've never known too many people (I think I just invented a new form
of modifier) who never tell or laugh at ethnic jokes, who never use racist
terms, etc. Most of us, unlike say Jessie Jackson (Rothenberg's example,
this time at dinner) or Ed Dorn or Tom Clark, try to be aware of who's in
the room (although I can tell you that as an astereotypical looking Jew I've
heard more than a few odd things from people who make the wrong assumption).
And almost all of us are smart enough not to publish the stuff. But the
occasional random spoken offensiveness and that one piece of published
foolishness, both possibly conceived and produced on one sort of bender or
another (understandable if inexcusable) shouldn't keep this (or any) crowd
away from _The North Atlantic Turbine_, _20 Poems_, _Gunslinger_, _La Gran
Apacheria_ (try to find the first, comic-book version), etc., where they'll
find none of that foolishness.
And while I'm at it, let me reminisce for a moment. I remember when my then
roomie Chuck Stein, as part of his effort to get me up to speed, read me the
opening pages of GS across my daffodil coffee table (daffodil was what the
paint co. called it. The table was all of six inches tall, but we sat on
floor cushions like a pair of pashas). I was then and remain incredibly
excited by the rhythms of that opening, the break from the regularity of "I
met in Mesilla/the Cautious Gunslinger" into "with slender, leather-encased
hands/casually folded to make his knock," the impetus of which sprung us
into a very long night and dawn reading aloud the first two books (that's
all there were), doping out (and we ere a bit) all the possible ways of
sounding it, because hitting the beat meant getting the sense and the
syntax. And I remember the months-long anticipation, waiting for the next
parts to appear, the rumors of whatever might be going on at the
publisher's, all that stuff, because we had to know what happened next,
where would he take it, could he pull it off?
Look, Dorn fucked up in public, but he also invented the Literate
Projector--feed it visuals, it turns them into words.
I've said my piece. By the by, I don't have my books beside me, and I
probably screwed up the lines from Slinger. All the more reason to check it
out yourselves.

I should _never_ try to write before coffee. The opening salvo of my last
should read:

"That Emily Dickinson participated in some of the less appealing aspects of
the culture of Amherst, Massachussets, then, as now (despite the heavy
academic layer imposed upon its essential redneckedness) a hick-town,..."

Actually, I know quite a few people who never use racist terms --

What does or does not enter into the "ouevre" of Emily Dickinson is not so
neat a question, now is it -- as she did not publish herself to the world
--

It does enter into the published verses of Pound, Williams, Cummings,
Stevens, Loy, jumping ahead Wieners, Baraka, Kerouac, JOnas,,,

Is there some wall betwixt poems and "other" stuff we are not supposed to
look over?  The fact that "Yankee" prejudices existed does not strike me
as a reason to continue to accept their non-surprising existence -- Isn't
it in fact because people are not surprised to hear racist terms that they
go on being used with such casual frequency?

enough -- I've got to go meet with some students

Hard to make any judgement stick when a tonal change is enough to put a safe
distance between us and our statements, never mind appeals to indeterminism,
group myopia or even (gasp) growth.  All the same, though we might have
broken dogmatism up for parts, the appetite for a stonefest is as insatiable
as ever.  Which was perhaps why political correctness was invented.  The
appearance of humanism yet all the fun of the chase.  Unfortunately, not all
baddies are so obliging as to declare themselves in their utterances.  At
least some of the real bastards take care to get the palaver right.  Which
is not to suggest that words cannot do lasting harm.  But spare a thought
for the slickos.

day one of the 25th annual twentieth-century literature conference here in
beautifully warm louisville ky (compared to london ontario that is), and i
stand here at an email terminal in the ekstrom typing away.  some 400
presenters here, and tho poetix in my opinion has received the short end
of the stick in past louisville conferences, it seems as tho we're holding
our own this year.  i just sat in on the following panel:

the modernist long poem: pound, sitwell, and stein.
        andre stipanovic, rutgers u, "ezra pound's coming of war in
the long poem: persona and the historical narrative in `near perigord'
        heather hewett, u of wisc-madison, "waves of words: the tide of
primitivist discourse in edith sitwell's gold coast customs"
        amy feinstein, u of wisc-madison, "`an invitation suffices for the
present': the abstract affair of stein's stanzas"

there are some other interesting panels going on now that i am missing:
one on elizabeth bishop, another on latin american poetry (borges,
olga orozco, and minerva margarita villarreal), as well as poetry/fiction
reading (richard m. henry, nancy kuhl, gary geddes, and catherine
francis).

i see a lot of fellow grad students strolling the halls and walkways here,
wondering if this is all nothing more than a c.v. line-item.  but i've
liked what i've heard so far.

tomorrow is the tom orange and dave chirot pound-williams-baudelaire-
kerouac-grenier show (debra parr had to bow out).  michael boughn is
supposedly about, and i'm hoping to meet maria damon and mark scroggins as
well.  i did make a point of swooping down on the publishers' book display
table and snatchin up in my grubby claws a copy of mark's new zukofsky
anthology, as well as a lovely copy of the rothenberg/joris anthology.

damn this telnet connection is slow.  more later, t.

Well, Aldon, I guess that makes thou and thine holier than I and mine. In
the multiethnic neighborhoods I have always inhabited we have never been
quite so pure. We all told and tell ethnic jokes, play with "foreign" words
and accents, call friends of other persuasions and origins by names that
would get an LA cop in trouble. Back in prehistory I was working with Bayard
Rustin, who would close shop sometimes after a very long day by saying,
"Alright, white boys, let's go home," to which us white boys would answer,
"Who you callin white boy, nigger?" We must have all been unreconstructed
racists. Or maybe context matters and sometimes informs political
correctness. Your friends, in fact, may be hypercareful around you, lest
they be judged. But if you guys really are that pure, I think I'd rather
hang around my own streetcorner. We may be nasty, but we do have fun.

Archness is so unbecoming. And let me point out, as it doesn't always

One can accept that something existed without condoning. No matter how
little I accept the prejudices of the long-dead, or the living, they won't
go away.

Let me say it again--it's not the racist terms that hurt--it's the context
in which they are used. Some people can call me jewboy and it's a joke,
others, it's fighting words. But hopefully we'll never have a color- or
ethnic- or gender-blind world--differences--not stereotypes--are there, and
they're interesting. Stereotypes are interesting, too, but that's another
discussion.

I guess I'm making a plea for some other kind of sense--look over all the
walls you want to, but don't let what you find make you blind. Check out,
and study, the public and private crimes, but note that poet a or b decided
which of his faults to censor.   Otherwise litcrit becomes tabloid
lit-tittilation.

I was also, I hoped, opening a different thread that I think is important.
We all do put walls between various kinds of discourse. Dickinson didn't
find anti-Irish sentiment appropriate for her poetry. That's interesting.
Pound included antisemitism but not shopping lists. I sometimes include
shopping lists but not Polish jokes. These are not always conscious
decisions, and the boundaries are flexible and malleable; we do, most of us,
impose such restrictions, however, in response to some internal rules or
other of decorum. The nature of that decision, and the fact that there is
such a process, is of the essence of most of our practice. If it were not
so, we'd be chanting our native woodnotes wild in the strangest of places.

Go lecture your students.

I'll begin by copping to the missssspeeeling, which therefore should not
have appeard in quotation marks -- apologies at all times for all my
typing --

on the other hand,

A post that begins by making reference to the possibole holier than
thouness of myself and certain of my friends, and ends by telling me to go
lecture my students, is an odd place to find the advice that archness is
unbecoming --

Of course context makes a difference -- never said it didn't -- the
Dickinson quote appeared in a post that made a quite clear distinction
between letters and poetry and which proceeded to ask questions about
possible learning that might occur in the discussion of both --

I will not get into arguments about whose neighborhood is more multiethnic
than etc -- I never said that I didn't know anybody at all who uses racist
terms -- I said that I know quite a few people who do not -- The people I
have in mind would certainly be surprised to hear it suggested that they
censor themselves out of fear of my reaction --

Glad to hear you worked with Bayard Rustin -- Rustin was himself the
object of both villification and humor on the subject of his sexuality --
I suspect he had a pretty clear sense of when he was being insulted and
when he was being joshed -- I suspect -- I don't know --

I do know that this discussion keeps turning away from things I have said
into discussions of positions that I have never taken --

I will be happy to continue on this subject off the list with anyone who
wishes to take the issues up with me --

I will not have anything more to say in the near future in response to
anything growing out of the Dorn discussion in this space, as I think
people who have read my posts attentively know where I stand -- and I
suspect that others simply do not care --

I don't know about some recent academic furor over Stein's politics
and/or support of Vichy government, but having read WARS I HAVE SEEN not
too long ago, I don't find any "support" for Vichy, although there is a
great deal of having to get along and live with it, and some sympathy for
those who had to play active roles in order to keep life moving along
(e.g., stationmasters for the railroad) etc.  there is much more pride in
the doings of the "boys in the mountains" that is, the maquis.  and of
course tremendous pride in being liberated by the u.s. army.

well, yes but then again this seems to be only a
handful of names--& while the acts associated
with those names have been & continue to be
very important, & while that work is certainly
among the most conspicuous from one vantage,
that doesnt necessarily establish theirs as
*the* guiding logic--which in fact seems to be
what you rightly pointed out earlier.

unless you just mean that theirs is the logic
thats guiding this conversation--the thread on
zoos & whatnot is what were discussing, right?--
in which case I think youre partly right, though
again I wouldnt say its the exclusive logic.

obviously the rhetoric of opposition
(& marginalization) persists after
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E--as someone mentioned
elsewhere not too long ago ["could we get more
vagaries down here?"], with the titles of some
recent anthologies its difficult to say where
exactly we suppose ourselves to be writing from--
or maybe not difficult enough?--but Im really
not convinced that it has to be read as the dire
endemic or retarding condition its sometimes
made out to be. if youll grant that a lot of
writers seem to have abandoned this model,
or seem never to have taken it up at all--which
you may not, but it seems to me that they have--.
& that thinking language practice as a political
opposition is one possible gesture among
others, & doesnt somehow become a determining
factor in the strong sense--. because I think youd
be mistaken if you were to assert that opposition
somehow means that were programmatically
writng in response to, or that anyones work has
become the determined negative image of,say,
american journalistic prose--. or that "rustling"
your work into the opposition "corral" somehow
deforms its reception--?

nor does it mean necessarily a sort of simplistic
one-to-one opposition between 2 groups
competing for the same resources ["there are
2 kinds of poems int he world,prose that" or
"this town isnt big enough"]etc. --shirts versus
skins?

obviously OPPOSITION is one possible line
of thought among others--one that I find useful--
but not *the* meaning etc.-- &not necessarily
such a restricted relation after all. so "not the
hegelian I used to be"--already smoked my last
pack of Absolute Spirit. of course whether or not
resistance is a useful view of swich or a poltical
reality ["tell me again of how your poetics resists
the naturalizing ideology of the new york times?"]--
is another matter.
&whether *you*find it useful to think wrtg
in thse terms--.

but the problem with "elsewhere" is that its
still somewhere--ie, just as firmly ensconced in
the social field as any other practice. ok, so
opposition is problematic, or needs to be
troubled--I can see that. but there is no
just elsewhere--another binary, one with an
occluded second term, doesnt seem to help.
"climb on, the avant-garde is a-leavin" sounds
like playing kant to david kelloggs bourdieu.

maps dont just s[imply a battle plan--raiding the
other tribes magic resources or flour. ["godoggo"].
an attempt to visualize the field of amerwrtg is just
what Id expect from the amercan left (this is not
a criticism)--which, among other things, tries to
piece together why it is exactly that something like
commodity capitalism (or in this case "the
bourgeois novel of the last century") persists.

but, yes clearly a sort of battle, though
in any case not just synonyous with complaints
of "clubbiness" or the its-who-you-know/
how-you-work atmosphere of a united nation's
arts councils or so-called mainstream publishing--
which is I think we can agree, just another stream,
if one that has accumulated considerably more
capital ["jeez its even gotten in the water here"]
--& so greater public visibility & influence in
determining what it means to make art, what forms
of expression are acceptable etc.--which, like it or
not, is political. to me, the presses that publish the
only writrs whose wrk Im really interested in--with
a few exceptions--, coupled with the copy shops &
internet servers where those wrters publish their
own work--seem ample, if in the accustomed
financially jeopardized sort of way. so reducing
the model to maps for claiming resources or sitting
arbitrations--kissinger & stalin passing napkins
about book sales or something--is, well, reductive.
not simply engaging in a turf ware ["wherefore"]
or just sour over somebodys grant applications--.

I dont think about this stuff because I love it or
because I think I ought to make The Big Money
on bonuses from dalton or departmental grants.
I dont have any particular longing to visit school
children or read to the 6 people present at 7:00 pm
at the Midville town hall arts center. Im a computer
systems consultant at the underfunded library of an
underfunded state university & I dont have any
books out that I havent put out & I dont really care.
but I would like to see more of the books that I like
to read on the shelves of that library or in local
bookstores--& not just for my convenience.

now whether I can still qualify for "hegemonic boomer"
status--? boom-boom-boom. well meet sometime &
you can give me a button or something. [smile].

love me, Love My Carpet,
chris, or ["whatever

GREETING WANT
by
John Welch


ISBN 0 905795 08 3   96 pages   Price GBP 6.95

Royal Octavo   Cover design by Amanda Welch

Greeting Want comprises a group of sequences written over the last eight
years or so. Some of the poems, while not making direct reference to it,
reflect the poet's experience of psychoanalysis; he contributed a chapter
'Dream and Restoration,' to Poets on Writing, Britain 1970-1991, edited by
Denise Riley (Macmillan, 1992).

Greeting Want offers lucid, gentle, remorseless sequences to remind us of
the 'plenty-in-absence' that may live at the edge of the inner city. These
are talking poems, not solitary or rapt, and they have spent their time
among people: the fantastic, dislocated heroism of migrant children, or the
torsion of passing from a domestic house into the traffic of streets, an
area where 'stone is ground down to a dusty meal of light'. Only a very
fine poet could wonder about his distance from the small heart of an owl,
calling in the city. Our present is where we start from in this writing,
while there is also the brush of bird-flight, occasional goddesses bearing
the work of a past and the horror of 'careful solitudes'. But the mystery
of incorporating others may overcome this undertow as we 'take the bright
couple into us' through the exact reflection of John Welch's true poetry.

John Welch has been a significant figure since the early seventies,  and
deserves acclaim.
His own aptly named Many Press has published numerous well-designed
pamphlets...
For my money, Out Walking is the finest volume Anvil have produced.
 - James Keery, PN Review.

John Welch's first full-length collection, Out Walking, is a considerable
and consistent achievement. The poems abound with intelligent reflection...
 - Rob Sheppard: PN Review

With Out Walking, John Welch has well and truly set off,
and I look forward to following his path as far as wherever it reaches.
 - Peter Robinson: Grosseteste Review

Blood and Dreams offers unlimited shelf-life, is flexible enough to continue
to 'give' with repeated readings. As a writer I seek those books which
provoke reverie and
inspire further writing; this is just such a book.
 - Martin Hibbert: Memes

Born in London 1942, where he now lives and works, John Welch has published
three full-length collections of poems: And Ada Ann (Great Works Press,
1978), Out Walking (Anvil 1984) and Blood and Dreams (Reality Street
Editions, 1991).

John Welch founded The Many Press in 1975, an imprint publishing new
poetry. He has written widely on South Asian Literature and edited an
anthology Stories from South Asia (Oxford University Press 1988).

R. F. Langley, Twelve Poems     ISBN 0 905795 03 2

Peter Riley has described reading Langley's poem 'The Upshot': "These are
no longer 'his' moments; they can enter a different life because they are
not trapped in circumstance. The craft of their forming, the traditional
poetic skills of constantly accurate comparison, lift them out of the
particular in their very fidelity to it, and we take them on as
unrecognised instances. It is our job to find them a home."

There are two extensive interviews with R.F.Langley by Bobby Walker in
Angel Exhaust 13 and 14. Langley's poetry was included in Michael Schmidt's
'Calendar of Modern Poetry' for PN Review 100.

Previous publications from infernal methods include A Different Mercy by
Mark Hyatt (now out of print).

It's all been fascinating, not least the new poems by D & Y. I'm a serious
sort & cant reply in kind, but not having heard about Dorn's comments I was
saddened to. Yet, I had picked up his _Abhorrences_ because of my
admiration for the poetry (knowing nothing of the man) of his earlier
books, & found it a great disappointment. So obvious, so lacking in the
poetic subtleties of his best writing. So: does this 'falling off" (in my
eyes) in the writing reflect a sad change in the man's
ideological/emotional stance? I dont know. I do know that Jerome Rothenberg
captured what seems to me to be the major point about Pound: that the
formal qualities of the writing were a teaching I had to have, even though
I knew how evil some of the man's ideas were. Perhaps we always have to
approach artists with a certain schizophrenia?

Thinking of that comment of Dickinson's I also think of Susan Howe's
visionary reading of her & her work 'in' the context of the whole
puritanical violence of american 'settlement' & how it has never
disappeared nor been comprehended. Then her (D's) ironies abound... But
must also as Aldon Nielson says, they must be interrogated, that means
'read' with as great insight & care as we can bring to them...

Chris -- I like your post, and I disagree. There are no commercial, few
civic, and fewer and fewer aesthetic points of divergence between the two
campsites, which, as the wardens in both are clever and vigilant, should be
around for
at least another half decade. The resources that are allocated by these
maps are not bucks, they're attention-hours. There is an audience; arguing
about its existence is insulting (not saying you did -- just countering a
wearying and often remark). The audience prefers that I use no terrain
metaphors. Don Allen's
amazing anthology transformed American poetry. It offered an entirely new
(yet pleasantly available) set of ways to look at words, at social town, at
sexual life, at the universe. I'm thinking, of course, of the Collected
Poems of Frank O'Hara. -- Jordan

since my own interests in literature are so often extra-literary or
schizo-literary I havent had much impulse to step into the turbulence of
the text the past few days...tho now I will remark that there is a
remarkable kaleidescope of outspeakings, I am heartened that T Mandel
felt this space secure enough to make his announcements (tho my own
affectations are perhaps opposite) & once again I observe the epikal
strength with which opinions wrangle theories & hope that that energy &
strength is equally transfered to the books you make & the readings you
do & the classes you teach....

from the permaculture perspective, everything gardens, the most abundant
the most diverse systems are those composed of unlimited edges meeting,
for instance the genetic diverisity of a pond meeting a woods is often
more complex.

somehow in a group discussion as this, it comes so easily to stand above
& scrutinize from a safe vantage point ...  while the real provocation
to write & read is multitudinously closer to the behavior of the text in
a paradigm that morphs as we speak.

Now is Pound's anti-semitism any greater than the farmer that lives down
the road.  I doubt it.  & he is my neighbor & his family has lived here
for 6 generations, they belong here on this land regardless of their
empty & unexamined mental life.  & Cantos is on my bookshelf, next to
the collected works of Gertude Stein, as is Gunslinger on the same shelf
as the Dictionary of Aberrant Behavior.

Re Christine Lorenz' suggestion to share spellcheck residues: "Holes in
the Argument" in *Face Value* was actually built around such a list, at
least I think so. I came across some unknown file in my poems-file with
all those words, semi-alphabetized: REAGAN'S REAL DISPEL REALM; sense was
nearly there: OUR CALLS PROCEED PROFESSIONALISM; NUMBLY O'HARA DESIRE,
etc. It couldn't have been a spell check file, with words like 'real' and
'our'?? But it had, as I remember, some designation like WP.SUP??

The Pound, Dorn thread calls up the tensions around naming, name-calling,
evaluation, community, groups-cliques-cabals-conspiracies, dismissal,
phobia. There's is so much to say that all particulars fray under
contradictory generalized forces. I admired Dorn's early work quite a bit:
his elegant political lyricism seemed so smart. Now it feels like he got
squashed by the demands of masculinization: in the work he read at the
Orono conference this summer he read a slinger-redux epic about heroic
outsiders--drugs and transportation hijinx; all the characters were dogs,
which was a bit funny, and allowed him to talk about bitches & garner some
uneasy laughs. But the whole thing was finally pretty broken down: the
piece wasn't finished, wasn't really funny enough to justify the conceit.

Poets with large political ambitions seem to have a hard time avoiding
stepping in real dreck the last few decades. Is it that (male) poets need
to feel they're taking it to the streets in some way or other? (How far
away is the gesture Tom makes of bashing Dorn?) Breton writes in the 3rd
manifesto that the archetypal surrealist act is running into the street
firing a revolver indiscriminantly. (After all, there's nothing but
bourgie protofascists out there.) Aren't Baraka's gaybaiting, antisemitic
poems more or less as bad as Dorn at his anecdotal worst? Maybe not quite.
And doesn't it feel somewhat preposterous the way it comes down to
measuring rhetorical atrocity?-- "more or less" despicable.

It makes me think poets are very irritated by being imprisoned, finally,
in the aesthetic sphere. In the chapter on Bruce Andrews in
*Marginalization* I ask if he means it when he writes "*sink* the boat
people!" Of course he doesn't. But he does want that intensity of
statement.

Pound is, for me, still the center of this problem. In the chapter on him
in *Trouble with Genius* I try to make it clear how impossible it is to
separate his politics from the lively avantgarde speed of his disjunctions
and juxtapositions. So I don't agree with Charles, in fact, when he
differentiates Pound's fascism ("small-minded, penurious political
accounting system") from his open textual style ("utopian"). This isn't
something to be clarified in the rapidfire ouija board regime of the
listserv, probably.

Just to be clear, I'm assuming that what you mean by "large political
ambitions" is a social agenda motivated by distress at the situation we find
ourselves in, as opposed to a desire for public office.
Do you think that what you describe is limited to poets? Male poets? Males?
Is it possible that these really are tough and demoralizing times for those
who believe in some sort--any sort--of equitable society?
Are you proposing aesthetic quietism as a proper, even a possible, cure for
those of us who continue to be afflicted with savage indignation?

Mark, it doesn't "sound" to this "observer" as if Bob Perelman were
prescribing anything for poets, male or otherwise, with "large political
ambitions"--rather observing a trend in some of them, over the course of
their careers. There are probably tons of counterexamples that the mind
doesn't notice first because they aren't as flashy to think of as a poet
who *does* get embroiled in controversy.

I'm still looking for the anagram web-site in my "archives" and will
post it when it turns up. In the meantime, here's something to whet, as
they say, your "appetite":

SAMUEL BECKETT = make, but select OR setback me lute (Irish inflection)
                 OR mute Blake sect (not to be confused with the

                 meet Keats club

(thanks to Heather McHugh for telling me about this originally and I hope
to find it in about five minutes!)

re: Mark Weiss's comment to B. Perelman: "Is it possible that these
really are tough and demoralizing times for those who believe in
some sort--any sort--of equitable society? Are you proposing
aesthetic quietism as a proper, even a possible, cure for
those of us who continue to be afflicted with savage indignation?"

Aesthetic quietism seems hardly what Perelman was proposing.
Perhaps just a practice of political engagement which doesn't
devolve so sorrily into rant.  I have no problem with pointing out and
- more importantly, of course - *doing something* about
"demoralizing times" and "savage indignation," but it seems to me
there's an implicit nostalgia in Weiss's castigation of *these* times
as opposed to others.  If *these* are the bad times, when were the
good ones?  Utopian visions can be backward as well as forward
looking and neither seem particularly fruitful to me.  Albert Murray:
"in  spite of temporary setbacks, the normal expectation in every
social science  melodrama is that everything will turn out allright."
What's more melodramatic than the silly bigotries a Pound or a Dorn
or a Baraka fall into?  No one wants them to assume a position of
quietism  just one which is brave enough to deal with the
complexities of their particular themes, issues.  Their Utopias are
just the flip sides of their Dystopias.  Neither are accurate and the
vision tends to progress in a direction which inspires boredom as
much as anything else.  (Baraka's distancing himself from Black
Nationalism seems an implicit realization of such problems).  In any
case I'm not sure highlighting the poles of "quietism" and "savage
indignation" do us any good.

     Does someone have a copy of the Chronicle article as well as Cotter's
     letter that could be made available in this forum?

     I have not heard that Syracuse plans to take back Dobyns.  My
     understanding of the situation is that certain of the faculty were
     delighted with his actions: it gave them the perfect excuse to be rid
     of him.

     The letter writers below seem naive in their call to modify
     capitalism, to end the commodification of celebrity.

yeah, what exactly DID s. dobyns do?  i know universities have a grotesque
"boys will be boys" policy when it comes to sexual harrassment of students,
especially when the harasser is is celebrity.  perhaps not ALL universities.
but i can think of two particularly grotesque cases in boston area, involving
three different universities, without trying very hard at all!

Of course we'll never know what Perelman meant if others keep speaking for
him. But I can tell you that by "these times" I meant the present
conservative tenor of the country that makes it harder to organize around
most indignations than it used to be in the bad old days when we had to face
large numbers of people with guns, not some past utopia when there was less
to be indignant about.

Large political ambitions do seem to do something to poets.  (Real
politicians, in my own experience, are much much much more cautious in
their speech, are mainly concerned with keeping out of trouble.)  The
list keeps focused on Pound, Dorn, fascism, etc.  That isn't the only
ideological problem for poets.  Mayakovsky, who himself said he "stepped
on the throat of his own song," and spent years writing political posters
-- which do have considerable artistic merit -- and a couple years
writing advertising jingles for the largest grocery store in Moscow.
(imagine Frank O'Hara on Gristedes).  But there is great poetry even in
rather troubling works like My Soviet Passport.  (There's enough dreck as
well.)  Or Neruda:  Canto General is a great poem, but I really do gag
on the sentimental Stalinism:

     In three rooms of the old Kremlin
     lives a man named Joseph Stalin.
     His bedroom light is turned off late.
     The world and his country allow him no rest.
     Other heroes have given birth to a nation,
     he helped to concieve his as well,
     to build it
     and to defend it.
     His immense country is, then, part of himself
     and he cannot rest because it is never at rest.

etc etc.

And Dante - being no medieval Catholic, and a Jew, I find that ideology
repugant, too.

It seems to me, in all of these cases, the problems are a) the poets are
still imperfect human beings and b) the ideologies for saving the world
tend to be on such sweeping scale that they inevitably involve alot of
what Anselm referred to as "othering the Other" which gives permission
for the sort of behavior and espousal of such views we are going back and
forth on in this thread.  When poets sing on behalf of power, that's a
problem, and when poet's decide they have unique access to the truth,
that too can lead to problems -- but in both cases the poetry can remain
great.

Pablo. . . where was your shit-detector
when it came to Stalin
and his evil-smelling crew?
His bloodied hands stank to heaven
yet you took the stink intor your lungs
and didn't cough once. Or retch.
Why? Did the Georgian smile
on that human shitpile
fool you? Or his moustache
a wiser poet than you
likened to a cockroach?
By all means one should fight for the poor:
let them have justice and bread
but one should fight without illusions,
without laughing gas in one's cavities.

1. There is a difference, certainly, between an objection I might make to,
let us say, an anti-semitism I find in Dante and an anti-semitism I find in
a contemporary poet.

In some essential sense, an easy-to-follow one, Dante is not a living
person. He's dead. His voiced opinion cannot -- by his voicing of it --
affect the politics and social facts of my life. (not to say that others
can't so use it: I'd take that up with them)

My objection to Dorn was to the living person's words and their living
reverberating presentness, not to the work either for that matter but to
the opinions of the person; why is this distinction hard to grasp?

It is a person causing trouble whom we must resist.

2. Bob Perelman suggests my offer to bash Dorn is close to a male poet's
need to "take it to the street," and how wrong can he be actually. I chose
the words "punch in the mouth" after all. At the same time, I did (twice)
say "if he comes around me" which should be easy to interpret. I'm
suggesting that the aggression is located in the objectionable opinion. And
expressing my annoyance at the fuzzy non-thinking I found on this subject
here in the list -- as if evil required interpretation to be understood
(no, only to be explained away). My technique was what Brecht called
"plumpe Denken" -- gross or vulgar formulation of a thought, a kind of
rhetoric yes.

3. Bob also suggests that "poets are very irritated by being imprisoned,
finally, in the aesthetic sphere." But poets are not imprisoned in the (not
even "an") aesthetic sphere. A poem is in language the inherent vehicle of
ethics and politics. The history of poets addressing directly (to make or
change) a current social scene does not begin with Dante nor end with Adam
Mickiewicz. It is coeval with poetry surely. In some sense *well*beyond the
way that a brushstroke e.g. is a signature of the artist, language holds or
extends the relation of poet and society to the forefront of consciousness
in reading a poem. What is said in a poem doesn't have the value of what
color is used in a painting. It is not, iow, a matter of aesthetics at all.
Precision in thought, I am saying, is essential to a poet in a way it is
not to a painter; sloppy moral thinking by poets about poets ain't allowable.

Well, maybe I'm overstating, do youthink so? It's late and I'm tired too
tired prob. to take "precision of thought" for a subject, as I'm not being
terribly precise myself. But, then, in a situation plain as the nose on
one's face, precision comes fairly easily. Or should. Not much weighing and
measuring required to revile racism.

Have just had the good fortune to see Mac Wellman's new play at the Ivy
Substation in LA and want to urge those of you in the LA area to go!  It's
called "The lesser Magoo" and has music by Michael Roth from San
Diego--really brilliant.  Anyway, Mac's play takes off on just about
everything in our society from political rhetoric  to New Age to the
standard interview (which made me think of the MLA interviews for job
candidates)--and the language is extraordinary--with its "unusualists".
It's only one one more week (through Sat night March 1) and I hope some
readers of this list will get to see it--great acting too.

sorry i didn't get a chance to get to an email terminal yesterday.  but
today the connection is much quicker.

i of course can't be too objective about my panel but i thought it went
well and got a nice attendance yesterday (micahel boughn, alan golding,
mark scroggins, and peter jaeger were there among others):

strategizing american poetics after williams
        thomas orange, the university of western ontario, "imagism,
objectivism, and the making of william carlos williams"
        david baptiste chirot, university of wisconsin-milwaukee,
"williams, kerouac, grenier: visual words, soundful visions"

we had a little trouble getting our overhead and slide projectors
synchronized, but dave's paper very nicely blended commentary with slides
of grenier's recent work which i am now happy to have finally seen.

the next panel i went to:
nation languages: kamau braithwaite, robert crawford and r.s. thomas
        mark d. mcmorris, brown university, "mis-handling the legacy of
empire: strategies of dynamic dispacement in kamau braithwaite's x/self"
        mark scroggins, florida atlantic university, "the forked tongue:
contemporary scottish poetry and the dilemma of language"
        david t. lloyd, lemoyne college, "through the looking glass: r.s.
thomas's the echoes return slow as poetic autobiography"
very interesting points of commonality between what would seem to be very
different papers,  not a whole lot of time left for discussion at the end
unfortunately.  but i have lots of new things to look up and read when i
go home.

talked zukofsky stuff over lunch with mark and and peter and jonathan and
then alas, the lure of book- and cd-shopping pulled me away from my duties
as a dutiful conference-goer.  went down to the bardstown road area of
louisville and picked up a few books, but more exciting perhaps was
finding tampa red and mississipi fred mcdowell cds (just cant find that
stuff in canada).

this afternoon i will go hear peter jaeger's talk on steve mccaffery, and
this panel also has papers on joan retallack, kathleen fraser, and tina
darragh.  then it's back on the road for the long trip back to london ont.
it was beautifully warm here all weekend (22C/74F) but now it's gotten
cold again, winter's back.

sorry for the inadequacies of this travelogesque sketch (or sketchy
travelog).  anybody who wants to know more can certainly backchannel me,
and maybe some of the other poetixers in attendance here will throw in
their two cents' worth.

cheers,
t.

jog my memory, Mac Wellman published what magazine?

also sometime back there was an inquiry about defunkt literary mags,
which is something Im keenly innerested in.  would love to know of, or
see a website established that logged this information in somewhat of a
chronological manner, as well as notating which publically accessible
archives these mags are housed in.

Subject:      Neruda and Stalinism
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I'm going to suggest an explanation of why Neruda's "shit detector"
malfunctioned in the case of Stalin. This will require a little history,
both personal and more general.
Although my family were what would be called democratic socialists in Europe
(Eugene V. Debs and Norman Thomas were tutelary dieties in our household),
there were still a lot of Stalinists around when I was growing up. Some of
them managed to hold on to the faith right into the sixties (My father's
flirtation with the American Communist Party, like that of most American
radicals, did not survive the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939). These were the
fathers and mothers of some of my friends, and I knew them well. Most
subscribers to the list are probably familiar with Ginsberg's description of
a cell meeting in Kaddish. That really seems to have been what it was like.
The party served a frunction for the believers not unlike the church for
fundamentalist christians--it was the center of social life as well as
ideology. As a result, members had little intimate contact with
non-believers. My best friend's parents actually met and carried on their
courtship at cell meetings.
This exclusivity was enforced from the outside as well as from the inside.
Police and FBI harrassment, during the cold war and before, were a fact of
everyday life, and blacklisting, even in less than glamorous fields, was
commonplace. The labor movement, in a bid to overcome the brutality of the
suppression to which it was accustomed, was purged of anyone who could be
suspected of radicalism. Religious schools reaped an ironic bonanza of cheap
atheist labor in the form of teachers who could no longer teach in the
public schools.
Early television was dominated by McCarthy's show-trials--I used to watch
them after school. And the trial and execution of the Rosenberg's, whatever
their culpability may have been, was an extended nightmare for people who
assumed that we were in the midst of a pogrom and who still were traumatized
by the images (for some, who had been there, by the reality) of the
death-camps. To outward appearances, weren't they a lot like us? Mrs.
Rosenberg and my mother even had the same first name, and the full-page
photograph of her body slumped over, straining against the leather
restraints of the electric chair, that graced the cover of the Daily News
the morning after the execution was the subject of many nightmares and is
still etched in my brain. If even members of the ruling class, and
Protestants, to boot, were not safe--we had seen Alger Hiss destroyed--what
would happen to Jewish liberals and radicals?
You didn't have to be particularly radical to be affected. The historian
Richard Hofstadter, for instance, spent years not being able to get a
permanent job because his views, far from Stalinist, were known to be left
of center. My father lived in fear that his youthful socialist activism
would come to light and cost him his livelihood, and when I began protesting
and signing petitions they were terrified for me. I was cautioned to at
least refrain from signing my name, because you never know when a signature
would come back to haunt you. To their credit, when the Vietnam War heated
up they did overcome their fears and participate in protest marches, but it
took a fair amount of courage for them to do so.
People routinely got arrested for refusing to take shelter during air raid
drills.
I think the first time I was called a communist was when I was twelve years
old. I was arguing politics with a friend as we crossed the street,
declaring my allegiance to Adlai Stevenson, when the cop directing traffic
spit the word at me like a curse.
Add to this the general assumption that the government and the official
media were dispensing propaganda instead of news. Most of us knew from the
radical press, for instance, that Arbenz, the democratically-elected
president of Guatemala, portrayed in the main-stream media as a communist
and a threat to the American Way of Life, was at best mildly left of center,
and that his overthrow was a CIA job, not a popular uprising.
Anyone who remembers the Vietnam era will not be surprised by this. It's now
universally known that the government lied to us repeatedly about what was
going on, and for many years the mainstream press was eagerly complicit. I
would go to demonstrations in Washington that you didn't have to be a
professional crowd-counter to know were pretty enormous--I mean, they filled
a lot of densely-packed space. In the wee hours, back in NY, I'd read the
early edition of the Times and learn that there had been maybe ten thousand
of us. It was late in the war the the editorial offices told their reporters
that they no longer had to lie, and suddenly demonstrations that were no
larger than the earlier ones were reported as hundreds of thousands strong.
To get the news you had to read the reports of the French Press Agency. To
older American radicals this was no surprise.
One indication of the degree of duplicity going back many years was the
changing manipulation of American public opinion about Stalin himself. A
monster in the twenties and early thirties, an uneasy trading partner in the
late thirties, a heroic ally when it suited the US government during WWII, a
paranoid monster thereafter. Why assume that any of it was true?
So there was fear, isolation, distrust of government and mainstream sources,
the fact of persecution, even for the beliefs of years past, coercion to
betray the pasts of friends, and there was also very effective Russian
propaganda. Some of my friends' Communist parents, like Neruda, had been to
the Worker's Paradise, often at the expense of the Russian government by way
of the American party. They were very carefully shepherded from Potemkin
villages to model communes and factories. That was the reality they chose to
believe in. Reports to the contrary were assumed to be tainted.
Of course, none of this, even in those circumstances, would have been
possible without the will to believe. Utopianism, like any true
believerhood, flourishes in a climate of desperation as a comfort for the
afflicted. The worse the desperation the more fervid the belief tends to be.
This brings us at last to Neruda. If things were bad for leftists in
America, they were awful in the feudal societies of Latin America. The kind
of quasi-official violence that marked US labor conflicts in the first three
decades of this century persisted in Chile, with the brief respite of the
Allende regime, until Pinochet. Neruda and other intellectuals were in
constant danger. He describes in his memoirs, and also, and I think more
eloquently, in his Nobel lecture, his narrow and desperate escape across the
Andes. The "disappearances" that became notorious under Pinochet and under
the generals in Argentina had been a fact of life, if less common, for a
long time. And Neruda did, finally, convenientlt die on the day of
Pinochet's putsch.
Stalin was one of history's great monsters, and Neruda's shit detector
certainly failed. He could, perhaps, have known better. But his was a
complex naivete that can only be read, I think, in context.

I don't think Mac ever published a mag; if he did, it was before he came to
New York in the 70's. He did edit a collection of theater criticism and I
think two collections of contemporary plays. And of course he has published
several books of poems and novels, mostly with Sun&Moon. I wrote the intro
to his first major poetry collection, which was published by New Rivers.
Mac has one a bunch of Obies. He may be the most prolific playwright since
Lope da Vega, and he's probably the best we've got. At his best he's great.
And I use the term advisedly.

i don't think yr being extreme or overstating yr case.  the more u talk the
more i'm in agreement w/ you, tho i still wouldn't punch dorn in the mouth,
mostly cuz i haven't been trained to do it properly; i'd probably leave the
room or tell him verbally to not talk like that around me.  actually, at
our panel at mla, my entire paper was an unintentional refutation of his.

thanks mark. i'm going to share this msg w/ my class on the sf renaissance.
it's hard for younger folks, myself included (born in 1955, to pretty
apolitical parents who were horrified by mcCarthy but not afraid for
themselves) to grasp the real horror of those years, which have been
delivered to us as "happy daze."  a few yrs ago i heard leo marx describing
the politics of my dept back in the 50s.  Allen tate was a genial
gentleman, he sd, but he (marx) suspected that if they'd had an honest
discussion about politics they wouldn't have had much in common.  i naively
asked, in the following q and a session, why they didn't in fact ever have
that honest political discussion.  he gently reminded me of the mccarthy
era and said bluntly, i would have lost my job.

I want to thank you greatly for this post, which brings back my own fears
and memories as well, not that they are that far beneath the surface.

Mayakovsky, one of my favorite poets, could also be found absurd or want-
ing, vis-a-vis the empowered State (Pasternak takes him to task), and
there is the oddly disturbing "case" of Rimbaud.

A final, moody, note - when people "become cases," what is implied? This
is an odd distinction, the identification of a person, personhood, with
a specific narrative turn - "the case of Solzhenitsyn," "take the case of
Faulkner," and so forth...

The call for spell-check and user dictionary files reminded me of a piece I
was working on a few months ago (still not finished)-- a long poem called
"rote" which is built from a 1930s speller.  The speller itself simply
lists words, from grade 2 through 8, but there is a sound patterning to
them, based on similar spellings and words that might be confused by grade
schoolers. I placed the  words into lines and stanzas adding nothing but
punctuation.  I go back to it every once in a while, mostly to take out the
punctuation I put in--not having worked with found material very often, I
tended not to trust what I found. (Probably by next year I'll have worked
it back to the original--just lists, that'll be it, and the time spent will
be the poem.)


Here's a sample, from "Grade 5"

Mist list sleet, sweep swept.
Taught daughter alike.  Aside
alarm.  Against good-by, goodnight.
Tax text.  Cloak means.  Stairs

Glee sleeve.  Ninth ninety

Speak, speaker, truly.  Geese

Joy, employ narrow

Acted actor acting.  Quit
quite jelly.  Jolly weekly,
deeply steel daisy.  Job blot junk.

Least yeast remember.
Remembered remembering

I feel awkward raging into the middle of this debate, since I haven't
said anything on this list in so long, and since I don't personally
know the principal characters, as everyone else seems to. But
certainly such things as tact and appropriateness have never stopped
me in the past.
     Tom's right.  And I shouldn't have to remind folks that violence
is not an inappropriate response to violence.  As I remember, Brecht's
original conception of plumpe Denken was a counter to those who would
use their oh so subtle metaphysics to deny or explain brutality.It
is crucial we remember this.
     Would I, personally, punch Mr. Dorn? I don't know the man well,
nor am I familar with his remarks. My "redneck" uncles always told
me never to thrash a man unless you knew for sure he needed a thrashing.
Or were certain that what you were making a fuss over warranted a fight.
In this case, I can say unequivocally that the fuss is enough, but the
man, well, I'd need to meet him.  But, then, I've never tried to hide
the fact that I am, indeed, a redneck too. Pass the Copenhagen!
     Thanks,

Eric

I don't disagree with any of Marc's comments re Neruda and Stalinism
(though it seems to me that in the 20s Stalin was the preferred choice of
the capitalist west over Trotsky, who wanted to export revolution --
Stalin was going to stay at home and build socialism in one country --
but that is a very minor nit).  and obviously Neruda was partially
motivated by the two impeccable decision rules: the enemy of my enemy is
my friend, and you take your friends where you find them.

but I want to note that one could also construct an equally rational
justification for Pound's fascism, espousal of Mussolini and probably
even the anti-semitism could be explained, justified, and so on.

we don't have the same direct stake in Neruda so we don't suffer as much
with his Stalinism as we do with Pound.  and I suspect most of us on the
list will generally agree with Neruda's attack on Yanqui imperialismo,
even if we are Yanquis, while Pound's views on Jews involve some of us,
at least me, in a different way that we can't sympathize with.

but Pound was never as rewarded by power as was Neruda, either local
Chilean (Senator and diplomat, culminating as Ambassador to Paris) or
international left (promoting his work in translation all over the globe).
the most support Pound ever received from the "state" was his room and
board at St. E's.

again, I am not here "attacking" Neruda or "defending" Pound.  I am
arguing that active espousal of big picture politics, particularly
chiliastic politics on either the left or right, will magnify other flaws
in the human poet.

I don't think I was trying to justify Neruda's or anyone else's Stalinism. I
was trying to explain how it was possible to be deluded, and to underline
the importance of context in understanding behavior. But let's get this
straight--I might be able to arrive at an explanation of how Pound came to
feel and act the way he did, but I'd still be left with a poet incorporating
into his work a vicious racist system based on a perversion of genetics.
That was a central element of his politics. Stalin was not central to
Neruda, communism (whether or not we think it practicable) as an ideal of
human justice was. His delusion was accepting Stalin as the instrument
thereof. But it was the pursuit of justice that was the motivation. While
both men may have been deluded I think there's a world of difference between
those two positions, and I hope that it's only the rhetorical habit of
symmetry that keeps you from seeing that. And I don't think that anyone
outside the Aryan Nation could justify Pound's position.

Just to pick at a nit, it's entirely possible that there were people in the
west who thought that Stalin was better for their futures than Trotsky. That
doesn't mean that they had the power to determine the outcome of the power
struggle. Or do you have copies of the cheques from JP Morgan to Stalin's
PAC? It's also not entirely clear (and here I enter into heresy) that
Trotsky would have been such a bargain for the Russian people.

Organization: Highland Community College
Subject:      Weiss, naivete, Neruda

In suggesting an explanation for why Neruda's "shit detector"
malfuntioned vis a vis Stalin, Mark Weiss recounts some of the extreme
psychological and ideological pressures endured by his radical
parents and their Communist Party friends during McCarthyism. He
argues, and quite accurately I'm sure, that the unrelenting
quality of this pressure quite naturally led to a circling of the
wagons
in rank and file CP circles which only served to narrow further the
political field of vision of honest and deeply moral people.

The story is moving, but I'd argue that it is fairly irrelevant in
terms of helping one to understand Neruda and in coming to terms with
that great poet's life-long and fairly visceral Stalinism. In fact,
Weiss's argument that
Neruda's "complex naivete" is analogous to that of U.S rank and file
CPers centers on his concluding
statement that, "If things were bad for leftists in America, they were
awful in the feudal societies of Latin America. The kind of quasi-
offficial violence that marked US labor conflicts in the first three
decades of this century persisted in Chile, with the brief respite of
the Allende regime, until Pinochet." Yes, Chilean history is one
of class conflict, and things were never exactly rosy for leftists
there, particualrly in moments of acute crisis, when, as in 1973,
the full force of the native ruling class and imperialism comes down
with an iron fist.

But an important part of the history of the Stalinized
Communist parties everywhere during the 30's and through WWII
(in line with Kremlin dictates that were driven by Stalin's desire to
maintain a modus vivendi with the U.S. and Europe)
is the renouncing of the direct struggle for power in the "feudal"
societies of the "third world," in favor of CP alliances with the
"progressive" and "nationalist bourgeoisie." This led in a number of
countries--and Chile, in fact, is a prime example--to the formation of
electoral alliances between the Communist parties and
capitalist parties, so-called "popular fronts," which in a number of
instances
around the world momentarily came to power. Far from pushing forward
a revolutionary program, the CP in nearly all these cases acted as
faithful junior partner, working to hold the trade union movement in
check, and often being in the vanguard of the
ideological and legal attacks on activists who would not consent to
these accomodationist policies (the classic and tragic case is
Spain, where the most rabid and successful enemies of the powerful
anarchist trade union movement were not the fascists but the PC of
Spain, on which see Orwell's _Homage to Catalonia_. But the old SWP
member, Militant newspaper hawker in me is coming back and I'm
getting long-winded. So how does this relate to Neruda?

In this way: Pablo Neruda was in no way a rank and file communist
whose personal life was under constant and relentless harrassment. Of
course,
he faced persecution in significant ways when the political winds
weren't blowing the right way, and he faced sthose with great courage
(e.g. his albeit poeticized flight across the Andes from the
previously "progressive bourgeois" Radical Party government of Videla
was undoubtedly heroic) but he was also a leading official
of the Chilean Communist Party, its Secretary of Propaganda for an
extended period in the 1940's, an elected CP senator during the
"Popular Front" Videla regime, and consul and ambassador for
"progressive" capitalist Chilean governments on two or three
occasions, all as an open member of the Communist Party.

On one of those "consul" occasions, Neruda was in Mexico for an
extended spell during Trotsky's exile there. Far from being "naive"
about the purges, show trials and summary executions of left-wing
communists in the Soviet Union, Neruda knew about them well and
approved of them, as any internationally prominent member in good
standing of the Third International did. There was nothing all that
secret about the purges within the movement. The crowning, orgasmic
moment, of course, of the Stalinist terror, was Trotsky's murder in
Mexico City at the hands of an NKVD agent (or was it KGB by then?).
There is a revealing moment in Neruda's _Memoirs_ when he writes,
with the idyllic atmosphere so typical of that book (but it seems we
can only assume it's true) about going to
meet David Alfaro Siqueiros, one of the two greatest Mexican muralists
(the other was Diego Rivera, Frieda Kahlos's husband, and both great
friends of Trotsky's), at prison, where he was conveniently let out
on Neruda's visits by the warden so David and Pablo could go drink
and have, as Neruda describes it, a jovial time. Siqueiros, a
prominent member of the Mexican CP, was in jail for an early
but failed team machine gun assault on Trotsky, which Trotsky
describes in some detail in the autobiography completed shortly
before Stalin finally got him.

I'd like to perhaps boldly suggest this, though I'm
unaware of any concrete proof, or other discussion of the matter:
Neruda was well aware of the efforts to kill Trotsky, was a fan of
the attempt, and was in close consultation with Stalin's henchmen
during his presence in Mexico. Why wouldn't he have been? Neruda was
close to a number of people in Trotsky's circle of avant-garde
admirers, which included Rivera and Kahlo, Breton and a number of the
French Surrealists, and
numerous Mexican writers and artists. Why wouldn't the
most prominent Communist Party member in Mexico and clandestine
drinking buddy of Trotskyite head-hunter Siqueiros have been closely
consorting with Stalin's henchmen? To think otherwise strikes me as
naive, and naive in an uncomplex way.

I don't mean by these comments (which I'd wager could be expanded
and made more credibly damning with benefit of some research) to
take anything away from Neruda's writing. In fact, I don't think it
does in the least, and the recent tough-poet guy commentary about
punch in the mouth strikes me as sad and silly. Dorn, Neruda, Pound,
are all great poets who have enriched our lives because they've shown
us in their own different ways what greatness the human imagination
is capable of. If they've compromised themselves in serious ways
through their public lives, as they certainly have, that speaks
to how strange and paradoxical the task of being a human being can
be, and about how the imagination can be at once capable of the basest
excrescences and of the wildest and most sublime beauty. Thank god
for poetry and the weird, indecipherable people that make it.

So to conclude, Mark, and with the greatest respect, I'd like to
suggest that Neruda was in no way like your parents or their
beautiful friends: He was
a very priviledged Communist Party apparatchik, who had a life of
relative leisure, title, and travel, and he used his position for
good and for bad. He knew quite a lot about what Stalin was doing,
approved of it, and participated in it very conscientiously in the
"long-range interests of the class struggle." I'd
suggest that given the explosion of popularity his name has enjoyed
given the uncannily _Memoir_ -like atmosphere of Il Postino, that
some careful accounting of his role is in order from poets who should
be more skeptical of such romanticizing.

These comments are certainly overly general, but your "complex
naivete" excuse seems somewaht easy, especially since the "fascists"
seem to get trashed on this list for behavior that seems, in
comparison to Neruda's (and who are the others? Hikmet, Brecht, even
Vallejo?, etc.), childish and almost poignant in its desperate
stupidity.

As one of the many presenters on the Lou. Conf., my trip to Lou., I shall
say, is a hell lot of driving, two nine-hour long and lone drive within
two days. So I missed Thursday's and Saturday's show, but I can report on
a few panels I wnet to on Friday.

Panel C4: Strategizing American Poetics after Williams
  Thomas Orange, "Imagism and Objectivism, and the Making of W.C.
Williams"
  David Chirot, "Williams, Kerouac, Grenier: Visual Words, Soundful
Visions"

Good attendance, nice slide shows. For myself, having seen Grenier's pages
(with those impressive two fingers) many times and having heard him talked
(or not talked) about those photos, it still felt fresh when somebody else
talked about them. Orange raised an interesting but arguable point about
Pound's inability to understand early Williams' poetry.

Panel D6: Readings in Anglo-American Modernist Poetics

  Yunte Huang, "Ezra Pound and the Chinese and Jewish Traditions of
Textual Practice"
  Jason Fichtel, "Go Down, Melanctha: African American Spirituals and
Musicality in Gertrude Stein's Melanctha"
  Benjamin Lockerd, "The Age of Eliot: Th Age of Einstein"
  Michael Campbell, "Comedy Both Human and Inhuman: Stevens' Poetry and
Bergson's Social Corrective Theory of Laughter"

I have to say, in terms of attendance and response, the panel went very
well. My paper was to relate Pound's hatred in unstable Jewish textuality
to some of the moves he made when he translated (the translation) from the
Chinese. Fichtel's analysis of those names in Melanctha (like Jef-fe-rey,
Me-lanc-tha) in relation to African Spiritual rhythems, which I don't know
much about, was interesting. Lockerd's paper is about Eliot's engagement
with the new development in physics (Einstein's theory), and one person in
the audience turned out to be a former student of Einstein. Campbell read
Stevens as a comedian, which I found to be more interesting than reading
Stevens' metaphysics. Before the panel, I barely knew a soul among the
five-hundred strong mass (except Alan G.) and could recognize a few names
and faces, but after the panel I had some nice chats with people who came
to me.

Panel F5: US Poetry and/as Popular Culture

Maria Damon, "When the NuYorican Came to Town: A Study of Poetic
Exchanges"
Christopher Beach, "Poetry on Television?: Bob Holman's 'A United States
of Poetry' as Video-Poetry Revolution"
Joseph Harrington, "America's Richest Poet, or The Meaning of Walt Mason"

When I walked into the room, a woman was smiling at me, and I thought that
was Maria Damon. But it turned out she was doing an "affirmative action"
count in the room, the result of which she would use to make a point in
discussion. And of course, Maria D. wasn't there, she remote-controlled
Alan Golding to read her kick-'em-in-the-ass paper about the social
exchanges among different poetry communities in Twin City. Harrington and
Beach used Mason and Holman respectively to argue for a popular function
of poetry. It was a lively panel, provoking various response. Alan, now
disconnected from the home-office in Twin City, made three comments, one
of which being whether some video poetry is actually using the mode of
production of the object of its critique (a structural-Marxist point). And
the woman who was counting "heads" earlier on (the reason she was smiling
at me, by the way, I guess, was that I was an Asian male) asked about eh
gender issue involved.

All and all, it was fun. Sorry didn't make it to more of the sessions, and
to Alan's party on Saturday night, but "we" are still during the six-day
memorial period for Deng's death, so no partying for me.

Could be you know the history better than I do--I, too, would have to do
more research than I am inclined to at the moment. But for the record,
wasn't Neruda a rather strong supporter of the miner's strike that was the
defining moment of Chilean leftist politics, despite whatever directives
came out of Moscow?
Also for the record, my parents were never communists nor always beautiful,
and only some of the communists in the neighborhood were beautiful. None of
them, even those very involved with the party, were fully aware of what was
going on in the Soviet Union, although they tended to be apologists. I think
that they were apologists out of a desperation to maintain their belief in a
set of human possibilities that met with positive reinforcement nowhere else
that they had access to. For the same reason many African American
intellectuals, who also should have known better, became involved with the
party. And I am suggesting that Neruda shared that desperation even in his
privileged, but insecure, position, that even, perhaps, witnessing misery
around him made him more desperate because of his privileged position.
(By the way, a meeting in prison is hardly likely to be clandestine, and
privileged treatment of privileged prisoners of the kind you describe is not
exactly unknown in Latin American jails)
Desperation can motivate a lot of unseemly behavior, but I'd really need
more proof to accept that Neruda was a party to any secret Stalinist plot to
thwart the gains of unionized labor. Perhaps he thought that alliances were
the best possible way to go in the circumstances. Those alliances certainly
for a time improved the living conditions of large numbers of people, even
if they failed to achieve a worker's paradise.
Let me go further. There is no question but that most of the CPs around the
world felt a need to remain in solidarity, and there is no question but that
they got detailed directives and funds from the Kremlin, but the evidence
seems to be that a very very few of the most important functionaries (Neruda
was never in that sort of manegerial position; in fact, he was out of the
country and out of contact with the Chilean party for long stretches of
time} knew the details of directives or even the exact channels for funds.
Even the FBI acknowledges this now. The information was just too sensitive.
Trotsky assassination theories have been for a long time the kind of
industry that Kennedy assassination theories have become in this country.
Neruda as conspirator is a new one on me, and I congratulate your
originality. I do think that that's a charge I would be wary of levelling at
anyone with no basis but ingenious speculation.
Was Neruda really the most important communist in Mexico?
Finally, to an old SWP member I apologize for having implied anything less
than complimentary about Trotsky.
I'm suddenly reminded of all those parties in my youth that dissolved into
partisan shouting and declarations of loyalty to one International as
opposed to another. Even then they struck me as more about theology than
history, and I swore I'd stop participating in them. And here I am, sucked
in again. But can I really leave your final statement unchallenged? As far
as I know, unless Neruda really was only friendly with Breton et al in order
to facilitate the assassination of Trotsky, he wasn't involved with killing
anyone or advocating the killing of large numbers of people for reasons of
race and ethnicity, although he may have swallowed and been an apologist for
the official party line on the show trials (it's hardly likely,
incidentally, that he was aware of the extent of the gulag system--the
kremlin rarely boasted about it to people whose good will they felt it was
useful to maintain). Maybe that's why some of us on this list get madder at
fascists of the 30's and 40's than they do at Neruda.

Not to downplay Mac's talent (Mac Wellman), which I applaud, but I have
another candidate here:  John Jesurun.  John is not as published as Mac,
but a)  his Chang in a Void Moon is a landmark in theatre.  It was a
serial, (much imitated since as a form) every Monday night, 2 showings, at
the Pyramid Club in the early 80s.  (Speaking of prolific) John would go
home after the show, write the next episode, cast and rehearse it by the
next week.  The main character was played by a man and a woman, one
character (the Infanta) was played by a chair, and the action took
place in several centuries simultaneously.  His staging (he directed
too) was absolutely seminal.  Actors included John Kelly, Steve
Buscemi, Anna Kohler etc etc.  The plot proliferated to the point where
John's intro before the show of the story so far was a verbal tour de
force which should have been saved for literary history.  Chang has been
revived in continuation a couple of times, including upcoming this March
or April at The Kitchen, for episodes 50-something to 60-something.

and b) check out his Philoktetes, in Yale Theatre mag a couple of years
ago, for some of the best American language onstage ever, in a work of
dizzying savagery.  It was written for Ron Vawter before he died.

And lots more in between.  John's EVERYTHING THAT RISES MUST CONVERGE
should at last be coming out from Sun & Moon soon (eh, Douglas?) but
there's also a huge body of produced work.

GO SEE IT!  That's what playwrights write for.

And let's not forget Richard Foreman.

Been mulling this one, Bob.  What does "means it" mean?  If he doesn't
mean what he says, what have we got?  A quote?  Irony?  Hardly sheer
(unreferential) intensity.  Maybe the audience at the Ear know he
doesn't mean it, but what about the guys at the back of the bar?  I've
always wondered about the "not-saying" position's dependency on cultural
context, especially when a lot of what we're supposed to understand as
"not-said" are other-cultural references (Wooster Group's use of
blackface, etc.)  I'm genuinely in a spirit of inquiry here, as a fan of
both Bruce and Liz LeCompte.  And though I've been critical in the past of
ungrounded irony, ie irony that doesn't state its critical position,
I'm not happy either with insistence on constant gloss and de-implication
of the speaker -- a kind of staking your tuft so you can point to the guy
on the next one and imitate him.  A you're-wrong-so-I-must-be-right
dogmatism.  I agree with BOTH Randolph and Aldon:

Hard to make any judgement stick when a tonal change is enough to put a
safe distance between us and our statements, never mind appeals to
indeterminism, group myopia or even (gasp) growth.  All the same, though
we might have broken dogmatism up for parts, the appetite for a stonefest
is as insatiable as ever.  Which was perhaps why political correctness was
invented.  The appearance of humanism yet all the fun of the chase.
Unfortunately, not all baddies are so obliging as to declare themselves in
their utterances.

and Aldon:
Isn't it in fact because people are not surprised to hear racist terms
that they go on being used with such casual frequency?

The problem is, that tonal change doesn't carry as far as we might like
to think.  Try travelling.  Even out of the "aesthetic sphere",or out
of where it's ok to insult your friends.

On some levels there's a dramatic question here.  Most cultures get
dialogue between points of view, so maybe the performance-implied (if
verbally denied) insistence on the poet's subject-position needs a shake.
Even if Charles B denied my suggestion that all his linguistic
tone-subject multiple shifting was dramatic.  And people still quote back
lines by my characters and say, "You said..."  (Poetry student, actually).
Hating speech won't get you out of it being read or heard or your
speaking.

just back from louisville, having gone there and back with my wife kass
fleisher, who gave a reading at one of the "creative" panels... so some
bookkeeping:

e:  according to the chronicle, that dobyns threw a glass of scotch in a
grad. students' face at a party and called her a "stalinist bitch" is
uncontested, both by dobyns and other witnesses... aside from which, it
appears that dobyns' "drinking problem" is also uncontested... there is no
doubt in my mind that the accusations against the program are accurate, in
terms of sexual harrassment, even misogyny... no surprise here, kass has
been hearing these rumors since 1986... i have to say---the question of the
status of "talent" in academic creative writing circles, and of
corresponding pedagogies, remains largely unexamined... unfortunately, the
shitstorm that has followed in the wake of this appears to have confused
sexual harassment, which has undoubtedly taken place, with (for example)
"vulgarity" (nonfiction writer mary karr has been accused of same)... the
article does *not* do a good job of airing out the issues, either...

an aside here:  seems to me that a poet, of some acclaim (whatever one
thinks of his writing), acting out his perhaps idiosyncratic impulses
thusly, is hardly an idiosyncratic matter... as suggested by the "red
collective" who signed that item forwarded to the list... at the same time,
sexual harassment and the use of vulgar language do  not necessarily have
anything to do with each other... w/o wishing to sound nostalgic, these are
indeed troubled times for academe... and i would argue that this thread has
a real and active bearing, at least insofar as academe is concerned, on the
dorn/neruda/evil poets/spellcheck thread... and i have greatly enjoyed the
exchange twixt mark weiss and kent johnson, albeit i'm feeling bad right
now b/c i think aldon nielsen's take on dorn has been misconstrued...

maria:  alan golding did a swell job of delivering your paper... the
discussion afterward was provocative, but i had to duck out to hear (none
other than) tobias woolf read, who in fact i now see is completely
embroiled in the syracuse university creative writing program
controversy!... talk about synchronicity... anyway, maria, i'm sorry i
missed *you* (AGAIN)... against yunte huang, i guess i would have to say
that there *is*, and was, a valid question raised about the gender-specific
attendance at this panel... no one raised a question about race as such but
this would be valid too, esp. in a panel in which two papers are engaging
the popular-poetic around, among other things, issues of ethnicity...
geezus yknow i hate to have to count, but what the hell... of the roughly
25 people in attendance, by my count, only 4 were women, and only 1 person
of color, if you would like to construct yourself in this way... the woman
was simply asking, why is this?---why did this topic draw primarily white
males into attendance?...

anyway, i would like here to publicly thank alan golding for his
hospitality throughout (kass and i left before his house party)... alan is
a sweetie, and it was great talking with mark scroggins, christopher beach,
michael boughn and others who had the generosity to put up with my
occasionally relentless mouthiness... i wish we could all meet f2f more
often... esp. in shirtsleeve weather!...

i would like to offer but one observation re the conference in general:
having attended keynotes as well as assorted 'critical' and 'creative'
panels, i was struck by the *relative* lack of crossover in the audiences
(excepting the keynotes)... that is, the creative panels, whatever one
thinks of such writing, were not particularly well-attended by the critical
writers with whom i'm familiar, and the critical panels, whatever one
thinks of such writing, were not particularly well-attended by the creative
writers i know... of course this is just an impression, as one cannot be in
two places at the same time... but if my sense of things is correct, there
continues to be a divide around this issue (even an architectural one,
given that creative and critical presentations were in separate
buildings)...

anyway, greetings to all...

best,

joe

I really appreciated Fiona Templeton's posting,
especially being able to put irony quotation marks
in a dramatic/performance presentation, yet does
(as Fiona suggests) this rescue a text's harsh remark?
The idea of being a rebel, a freedom warrior, against
political correctness, sometimes is not against pc
but sharing power.

Then again, un-pc remarks made by individuals
in private can sometimes be a release from the
hard work of diplomacy/public behaviour, *by those
who are very committed* to anti-racism etc, who
have *practical effect* (e.g. on lobbying for funds
and conditions) *outside language*.

One of the
roles of writing has always been to place language
kept private so as to bring it "out in the open": the
literature of anti-repression. But also one of the
roles of writing has always been to place private
language and private experience in a way that
readers *identify with*; as they share the placing
of it *as private*, keeping it *non-public*, in
the interests of good public life.

"i still wouldn't punch dorn in the mouth, mostly cuz i haven't been
trained to do it properly"

It's the nose that's his weak spot. Tho I don't approve of poking 67
year old men in the nose either.

When I was in Boulder at Naropa a few years back, folks there said that
Dorn never let himself set foot on the Naropa campus anymore. I thought
at the time (as I do now) that that must feel like a horrible kind of
exile.

I think it's a mistake to focus this discussion on Dorn, though. Jack
Spicer made anti-semitic statements, for example. Clark's homophobia,
sick as it seems, is ultimately an extension of the same social
ensemble that allowed Eli Siegel ("Hot Afternoons Have Been in
Montana") to go around "curing" homosexuals or that enabled (forced?)
Robert Penn Warren to drop Duncan's work from his magazine when RD came
out of the closet in print elsewhere. Considering how much Tom Clark
did, positively, to broaden the audience of the New York School, it
seems bizarre that this other side should finally win out.

One thing that does ring out, though, in the instance of both Clark and
Spicer at the least, is that sense they have of themselves as (more or
less literally) monstrous. It's what draws Clark to both Celine and
Olson (it's the only thing about Olson he seems at all sympathetic
toward).

I suppose it's an improvement of sorts if this sort of pathology
becomes knotted right in such self-identified monstrosity, although as
events in the former Yugoslavia have shown, there's plenty of the old
banal genocidal potential still around for everyone.

I'd love to hear from Kevin (or anyone else, for that matter), what the
function of anti-Semitism is in Spicer's work/psyche.

I'd also like to add a thought to Fiona Templeton's
thread.

I was reading Steve Benson in Language Alive, and
Fiona's post helps me to think through some responses
I had. Steve Benson seems very much concerned with
decency, warmth between people, intimacy, difficult
emotions that a relationship, or a social discourse
can't easily take. This later work, to me, kept
jumping back from itself, ironising itself, in a way
I find less powerful than the early material, like
the Blue Book book; as if to offer passion but to
remain calm and beautiful and funny, in this later
work.

And that makes me think of the different
uses of one kind of political theatricality: camp.
One feature of camp, for me, is that it touches
lightly on issues for obvious necessary change,
and then refuses to debate them ("I've heard that
objection about a thousand times, yawn".) The
refusal of that kind reminds me of some "it's
non-referential" comeback lines to obviously
political Language Writing, and LangWriting has
the feeling, to me, of gay camp (not least in
early Steve Benson); many of its
writers had political conviction, civil rights
convictions especially, before writing; they
don't discover the convictions, they camp them.

But, what happens to new convictions that
have evolved in communities based on and still
practicising the old convictions; what happens to those
feeling the new convictions who have no community?
What happens to child abuse campaigners who are
ironised (eg "don't take it so far, oh come on")
by Carol Tavris, writer of very powerful books
of seventies' feminism? What happens to those who
have latterday visions, for whom God moving in
mysterious ways compromises their commitment to
a (necessarily) programmatic civil rights politics?
If one believes in repressed memories of child
abuse, or visions, (I do both), or heresies to one's
group's or friends' (or audience of them's) positions,
can these come through? Or can they be blocked
from coming through in speech/art as speech/performance,
by "ironic" tone switching? Can some camp rely on too
rigid a pre-established schematic of repression and
anti-repression? Though I don't underplay the good role
of solid, if reactionary, first-wave progressives - he
closed, ironico-sweetly, but not therefore falsely....

thanks for the report yunte huang and others.  wish i coulda been there.
i'm scared about the local fallout/backlash i might get from my paper,
which is forthcoming in nowak' corsscultural poetix ragmag.  it's still a
rough paper but i was under a deadline that mark was very generous about
but i still couldn't make it an elegrant and generous piece of writing, nor
a sharply analytic one.  oh well, you heard the disclaimer here first.  and
btw, alan golding, thanks a lot for reading the piece!

just read a very good ms that talked about protests against an african art
exhibit in toronto(?), to which the curators responded, but those racist
images are meant ironically, to which the protesters responded, yes, we
know, and the general public knows also that it's ironic, but the irony
simply isn't enough to offset the overpowering images which resonate so
thoroughly with their NON-ironic racist counterparts...
i found that very interesting and worth further investigation as a line of
argument.

i think the function of spicer's antisemitism is
1) part oif a general east-coast phobia (part of what he complained of abt
nyc wa the "jewfaced children")
2)a sense that judaism was homophobic (cf the story of lot in sodom), and
that jews had a more public claim to oppression than gay people, which he
resented.

Just for the record, the incident around rejection of Robert Duncan's
previously accepted work (following his published article revealing his
homosexuality) involved John Crowe Ransom rather than Robert Penn
Warren.  This is an unfortunate slip-up but a reminder of how fast
gossip and rumor can spread via this medium, i.e. that whatever Ed Dorn
(as a pertinent case in point) may or may not have said on some occasion
that still hasn't been clarified or pinned down, the poetics rumor mill
has now put him (& whoever else) into a racist league (etc.) that
probably has little to do with him.  In other words, this is a public
& not a private medium, a form of broad casting that can rapidly
disseminate misinformation in a way that can quickly and actually do
harm to people.  Nor would it surprise me if some of the dumping on
Dorn in particular had some subtext -- of other resentments -- that isn't
being stated.  What did the man possibly say that puts him in a league
(the way some of the correspondence sounds) with Pound's anti-semtism or
fascism?  What if anything?  And if a triviality or not, how will he
now get out from under it?

Some thoughts, anyway, on a sunny a.m. in San Diego.

It's Kevin Killian here.  Maria, you have hit the nail on the head as far I
know; I'd like to add a couple of other points too  . ..
3)a pathological rebellion against various strains of Spicer's family myth;
the hideous things Spicer wrote came directly after the death of his father
4) a psycho-dynamic between JS and Robert Duncan, in which Duncan was the
"good" man and Spicer was cast as the wild fauve; and in general a poetic
climate in which savage, problematized irony was valued, the thicker the
better

I guess I should share my dilemma with you all, what would you have done?
(I've been writing, with Lew Ellingham, a biography of Jack Spicer for many
years, and some of you know this story already.)  A few years ago I was
lucky enough to get to examine the papers, which are in private hands, of
the poet Stephen Jonas; and imagine my delight when I found among them an
"unknown" poem by Spicer.  Then imagine my anguish when I read it and saw
it was by far the most anti-Semitic of all his writings.  A lot of you on
this list are scholars, what would you have done?  I had actually the
option, I suppose, of destroying this poem; for what good would it do to
show it to the world?  I felt like a character in a Henry James novel--no,
in an Irving Wallace novel!  I tabled a number of Spicer experts, one of
whom advised me gravely to "get rid of it.  Spicer's reputation is bad
enough already.  Besides, does 'the world' need yet another piece of
anti-Semitic propaganda?"

What would you have done?  I had the piece of paper right in my hand, and
no one would ever have known.

Except I probably would have told someone, I just can't keep myself to myself.

Please give me your opinions on this.  Thanks, Kevin K.

Dear Jerry, and others, whatever, it's Kevin Killian here, and I have tried
to stay out of the Dorn debate as long as possible, but I just can't keep
myself to myself.  A few years ago I wrote a letter to the editors of the
Buffalo magazine "Apex of the M," prompted by an issue of the magazine
which contextualized Dorn as a great human being and poet and thinker.  My
letter was pretty mean I suppose; the editors decided not to publish it
because, they said, they don't publish "letters to the editors."  This was
a policy decision on their part, okay.  Kevin Magee and Myung Mi Kim then
printed my "Open Letter" in their poetry newsletter, whereupon it became
part of the public record.  If you would like me to send you a copy just
let me know.  (If anyone on this list or elsewhere would like a copy, send
me your address.)  After you read it, Jerry, you will have in fact the
answers to some of the questions you pose above.  Love, Kevin

When did Spicer's father die? How did the family myth occasion "New York jew
salesman of amethyst pyjamas?" Please elucidate; for the uninitiated this is
all in cypher.

I would have included the poem in the Spicer biography, and probably in an
appendix to the poems. But I would have made it clear that Spicer didn't
publish it. Often professional responsibility outways private feelings. I
doubt, at any rate, that Spicer's poems are likely to reinforce anybody's
antisemitism. He's not exactly a household name, and access to his work
usually involves a fairly sophisticated education (formal or informal) that
would likely make one a poor candidate for the skinheads.

To have destroyed the poem would have been barbaric, to have suppressed it
dishonest and in any case counter to the biographer's task.

Even though I hate Spicer's antisemitism, and take it personally, his poetry
is very important to me. He's dead, so I can't talk to him about it. But
anything that aids my understanding of his work is useful.

Subject:      Neruda/Stalin

Dear Mark:

What Neruda relates in Memoirs is that he met with Siqueiros on a
number of occasions while the latter was in prison for leading the
first attempt on Trotsky. The warden would let Siqueiros out, and the
two would go off to a bar somewhere for a few rounds to return before
morning. If Neruda's account is true, I'd say it raises some
questions about his activities and associations in Mexico. I
never said that Neruda bore any *central* responsibility in Trotsky's
murder, only that his position, enthusiastic pro-Stalin allegiances,
and warm liaisons with a person deeply implicated in the events would
make it seem quite likely that his politics within the world of
leftist factionalism may have been less romantic than the Il Postino
variety.

A few things in response to your last comments:

1) that Stalin ordered Trotsky's murder and called on leading Mexican
Communist functionaries to help carry it out is no more an
"assasination theory" than the CIA's involvement in the coup against
Allende is a theory. What other "theory" is there?

2) I never said "Neruda was a party to any secret Stalinist plot to
thwart the gains of unionized labor." The Third International was very
open and eager in fact, during the popular front period, in telling
workers that socialism was not an immediate goal. Here it's not a
question of whether this was right or not, but it is relevant in so
far that in various countries the local CP's branded workers who
did not accept this "gradual road" to socialism as fascists and
enemies of the working class. In Spain, a conflict Neruda was
intimately involved with, this often came down to open attempts to
crush the syndicalist unions and NKVD plots to murder individual
union leaders. This is not speculation, nor is it speculation to
think that Neruda was very clear on the factional politics of the
Spanish Republic.

3) I didn't say that Neruda's close friendship with many of those
writer's and artists around Trotsky was a convenience to aid the
Kremlin's machinations, and Neruda never betrayed any of his friends
to my knowledge. I was only suggesting (and I'll stand by the
hypothesis) that Neruda's involvement with those
in the artistic circle around Trotsky, his obvious approval of the
Siqueiros raid, his international prominence as a supporter of
Stalin, and his official Party position, make it highly unlikely that
he was not consulted by Stalin's agents (who were surely
meticulous) and makes it seem reasonable that as a loyal Party
member he would have had no problem sitting down to talk if asked.
If he could sneak the guy who pulled the trigger out of jail to drink
tequila a bunch of times, why does this seem such an
"original" strech?

Anyway, I want to be clear that my purpose in raising the issue was
not to promote Trotsky, who was surely a great deal more cold-
blooded than Neruda and clearly capable of more human sacrifice with a
clear conscience than most Marxists. Nor, by the way, do I retain any
nostalgia, personal or political, for the paranoid and sectarian
world of the U.S. old left. Sorry to have "sucked you in" as you say,
to what I guess are some shared unpleasant memories! But I would
confidently assert again that Neruda was in no way a naif vis a vis
the blood-bath against the "Trotskyite class-enemies" in the USSR,
and his apparent celebration
of efforts to knock-off the leader of it all would seem to support
such a position. In saying that I am mainly trying to suggest that
passionate politics often lead even the most generously creative
minds into very ungenerous stances, and this happened with Neruda in
his support (eventhough in his mind, I'm sure, they were tragically
necessary) for policies in the Soviet Union that were grossly
criminal. Here's an interesting question: Are you aware of any
statements by Neruda disavowing his support of Stalin following
Khrushchev's revelations? He may well have made them, and if so
it would be pleasing to know that.

And above all, the underlying point to my previous post and in this
one is the following: None of it, whatever the full truth might be,
changes one iota Neruda's greatness as a poet.

In reply to Kevin's question What to do (or have done, now), I second Mark
Weiss's post--preserve it, deal with it. Of course. But there's always one
other option--put the poem back in its folder and walk away from the whole

Of course not. But it's good to know who the enemy is. Let it stand.

this sounds sensible to me.  actually, i don't know why, but i don't take
spicer's or baraka's (former) antisemitism personally, as i do pound's.
something to think about there for me.

For me there are antisemitisims and antisemitisms. Pound acted on his; I
read his radio speechs in which he among other things (if I remember
correctly) calls for the elimination of Jews. They're vile and hateful.

Antisemitism "otherwise" - say in 19th or early 20th century Britain was
such, that as a friend put it, if we didn't read the work of British
anti-semites, we would hardly have any English literature to consider. It
was convention, conventional. It was not yet an era when such hatreds were
reificed, debated, etc, (maybe Dreyfuss opened the way).

For me, likewise, Baraka, who has reconsidered, and always considers, it
is different; I too read him.

What I'm saying is just as there are _feminisms,_ so there are _hatreds,_
not all equivalent, functioning within different discursive formations,
different institutionalizations, and it's a mistake to consider all of
them equivalent.

Rae Armantrout here to give her first Vancouver readings, Thursday and
Saturday. Damn, I am living a life that is not easy these days, and I
missed her Saturday night reading at the famous Kootenay School of Writing,
had to help elsewhere, but made it out to UBC for the 5 pm Thursday
reading, lotta excited young people there who have been turned on to Rae's
poetry for a few years, and we were all so glad that she read from two
books and then all of her new manuscript, no corny talk in between, just
that really American woman's voice reading those clear lines, and everyone
ate it up, and of course young Peter Carlos Peters was in 8th heaven all
thru.

Bravo. Why argue with the dead? the artifact in a different context is a
different artifact (paraphrase of Victor Turner's entire corpus). Context is

What a strong actor Vawter was.  Might be I only caught him once, in
The Temptation of St. Anthony (The Wooster Group), late '80s.  (One

and she raises questions, with various instances, abt. some of our
assumptions as to the validity & scope & (even) nature of irony.
Very tricky stuff, this.

While not quite on so rarefied a plane, perhaps, this discussion
happens to bring to mind a recent, under-rated "mainstream /
independent" (think it could be called?) film -- *Mother Night* (w/
Nick Nolte, based on Kurt Vonegut's eponymous novel).

There, some real basic-level problems with "not meaning what you say"
find much scope for harsh reflection.  I'm not saying that the film's
stark situation is akin (or even *directly* relevant) to the very
different, & much more complex species of not-meaning what's-said
found in (e.g.) poetics practice.  Rather, the Vonegut tale sets out,
in a (so to say) clean, literalist manner, some (at least) simpler
aspects of this really large & multiform issue & subject matter.

best,
d.i.

Subject:      killian / pug selves

Kevin Killian's ("public") response to Jerome Rothenberg's clearheaded
comments on the potential for malicious and/or ill-informed e-mail
gossip--strikes me as rather odd:

1) KK informs us all that his letter to the Apex editors was/is "mean;"

2) he tells us the A editors refused to print it, but that it was then
printed in a no doubt fugitive poetry newsletter;

3) he offers to send  copy of the letter to anyone of us who wants to see it.


Is 1) some sort of preemptive self-criticism?  If the author of a piece of
writing characterizes it as "mean" even before anyone has set eyes on it, how
can it be taken (seriously, as they say) as a 'definitive' answer to factual
questions such as those asked by JR?

And 3): Why, if it is indeed "the answer," does KK not simply post it on this
listserv?  Allow me to, hereby, formally challenge him to do so.

Dear Anselm,

Hi!  It's Kevin Killian.  Yes, 1) was a form of preemptive self-criticism.
I don't expect you to take me "seriously."  I felt drawn in to the ongoing
discussion about Ed Dorn based on personal feelings, not definitive ones.
I wrote my "open letter" as a friend and the literary executor of the poet
Steve Abbott, who died of AIDS a few years after being awarded the "AIDS
Award for Poetic Idiocy," in the pages of Ed Dorn's magazine "Rolling
Stock."  I write on behalf of one on whom a beaker of poisoned blood was
poured by the talented staff artists on "Rolling Stock," one who on his
deathbed still strove to understand the motives behind this attack, one who
tried to forgive, one who tried so hard to forgive it broke my heart.  He
is no longer alive, but I am, and why shouldn't I say exactly what I feel?

I decline your challenge to post my open letter on the poetics list.  I
have already offered to send it through the regular mail to anyone
interested.  However why should I waste the bandwidth of so many who have
no interest in the subject?  It's quite long and involved and also uses a
lot of italics, Anselm.

It was published in a "fugitive" poetry publication, true, but don't hold
that against it.  (You might say "Rolling Stock" was a fugitive
publication: that doesn't mean people don't read it, people don't take it
to heart, and people don't cry after reading it.)  What's "fugitive" and
what's not?  I forget what happens in the pages of the New York Times Book
Review a minute after I read it, but I have not forgotten many of your
poems, for example, years after I spotted them in various "fugitive"
publications over the years.

Yours,


Kevin K.

This Ed Dorn thing is so weird.  Especially reading it on the list.  Slowly
but surely, i am getting a story about his supposed racism, and so forth.
But it took like how many letters to this list to get this story out?

This is all very interesting, but I can't make a judgement on someone in
this fashion.  And I am not criticizing anyone on this list - this is for
sure hitting a raw nerve (and perhaps rightfully so), but I don't feel
comfortable talking about someone behind his back in such matter - meaning
Dorn.

Perhaps it is best that this subject matter is transmitted by backchannel
to interested parties. The issue should be talked about,and it is a good
subject to bring up..but again, I am not comfortable with all this.  Maybe
he has changed and regrets his actions, or perhaps he is a creep galore.
Again, I think it is best to focus on the writing and deal with racism
within the work,and not talk about someone's private life and their demons
- unless of course it is part of their creative work.

Yes--he credits Michaux ("after Michaux"), and I probably should have
mentioned that.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Rachel and others:

        It's interesting to think about Berrigan's line "I like to beat
people up," which has surely caused difficulty for many, in light of Ron
Padgett's fascinating memoir of Berrigan, "Ted," which I've been reading
in what few spare moments I have these days. Berrigan's relation to
conventionally "macho" behavior--itself a complex cultural/class
phenomena--is equally complex. He seems to have admired some of the more
rough and tumble male members of his own family, and in particular admired
Padgett's own father, who really did, it seems, have an urge to beat
people up. On the other hand, as much as Berrigan would "admire" such
people, he spent his life staying as far away from them as possible, and
Padgett reports that as far as he's aware of, Berrigan never did get into
fights. If I'm reading Padgett right, that Berrigan was NOT a fighter was
both a key to his difference from the men he grew up around, and a source
of shame for him--he wanted out of that world but remained under the thumb
of its definition of male behavior. I'm not going to go on a huge
psychological trip here, but there are many indications that Berrigan
internalized a violence he disliked but couldn't shake--is there an
element of self-hate, self-mocking running throughout his work and his
tendency to abuse his body? Can't say because I didn't know him, but it
wouldn't surprise me.

        Teaching at a community college in a small suburb, distant from
Washington D.C., but which nonetheless has been reported in the local news
as having "the largest amount of gang activity anywhere in Montgomery
County," I'm used to dealing with students who have an obsessive relation
to violence, even when they're on the run from it. More importantly,
though, while I'm hardly in favor of "beating people up," it can be too
easy to disassociate that kind of direct physical violence from the less
apparent, but in some ways more successfully violent aspects of supposedly
"safe"
bourgeious society. My experience has been that some people from
disadvantaged backgrounds are completely unprepard to deal with this kind
of "indirect" violence--nobody punches you, but they deny you
opportunities for reasons you never see coming. Indeed in some cases it
might even be preferrable to have somebody violent standing in front of
you--at least when the knockup punch comes, you have the opportunity to
duck. The success of violence inside a disciplinary system is precisely
that it no longer has to rely on beating you up directly--it has the
incredible ability not only to bruise you permanently, but to leave you
convinced that your only opponent was yourself.

bravo kevin.  i have no wish to alienate so august a presence as anselm,
but your initial post seemed clear enough to me.  someone sez, what did
dorn exactly do, you offer to clarify that matter, and your integrity gets
impugned.  as for the "fugitive publication" matter, perhaps i'm mistaken,
but i thought one of the objects of this list, and certainly it is an
object of my work, to bring the seriousness of such "fugitive" work to the
fore and take it seriously.  it does seem kind of weird when fugitivity is
used to discredit an artifact *here* of all places.

Mark Wallaces comment, "Berrigan's relation to conventionally "macho"
behavior--itself a
complex cultural/class phenomena--is equally complex," reminded me of
O'Hara, and of course of his relation to Berrigan.  What he notes of
Berrigan is all over O'Hara's work and biography too.  Some have pointed
to this as a complex dimension of his homosexuality - if he was going to
love men, he was going to love *men* in their full, 1950's style cultural
construction as tough-guys - hence his attraction to New York artistic
toughs like Pollock, Baraka, Corso, and heterosexual men generally.  What
does this say?  I don't know.  In part it seems O'Hara's refusal to be
stereotypically "gay" (what he couldn't stand in Warhol).  In part it
seems an indication that he was as trapped in the cultural constructions
of his time as everyone else.  Somehwere in btwn?

Actually, I have no trouble with those lines; I adore them.  My post
wasn't meant as any sort of comment on Berrigan's behavior (am not
saying that Mark thought it was, but just to be clear).  Something in
the campiness of the lines convinced me that Berrigan did not go around
popping people.  I posted them as comic relief, or to turn the
discussion on its ear.

I understand all the fuss about Dorn. What he and T. Clark published re:
AIDS is a horrible thing. I'd like to hear their side of it if any of you
have contact with them and they're interetested in responding--or have they
elsewhere?

But on the other hand, it seems to me this list has taken a self-righteous
turn. I admit, I don't know much about Dorn personally, but in my last
decade + experience in the university, assholes abound and poets abound,
and sometimes one is a subset of the other. Actually, it seems to me the
university is concretising its self-righteous turn.

Among the subjects that seems to always come up, and for good reason, is
Pound.
I agree, Pound's behavior was evil, no matter how much anyone finds
reasons--Italian isolation, etc. But on the other hand, telling the one
story, as Bob Perelman has done, gets only one part of the job done--that
is, I disagree with whoever it was who lauded Perelman's book on Genius.
Perhaps the Stein, Zuk, and Joyce chapters are okay, but I find the chapter
on Pound a bit trendy, a bit facile. Perelman takes the Pound of the late
1930s on and reads backwards, mostly ignoring the Pound whose reaction to
the avarice that brought on WWI prompted him to take  some admirable
chances in his early Cantos; I find Perelman's book equally as underdone as
those books which look at some of Pound's earlier thought and try to press
that over the truely evil shit in Pound's later work.

I like Perelman's poetry.

I like Dorn's poetry too, especially Slinger.

I don't think one has to be schizophrenic to see in the work something
useful and something humane, and to see at the same time that it may be set
beside something awful in the human being who wrote it, or even in the very
next line of the poetry itself.

Rather than seeing the world in Hollywood black and white, wouldn't it be
more useful to explore the complications of "good" and "evil" (as they've
been labled on this list)? In the case of someone such as William Faulkner,
for example. It's true of his work that his portrait of blacks is sometimes
terribly condescending, and he wasn't exactly an advocate of the Civil
Rights movement in the South, but it doesn't mean that his work doesn't
have moments which might teach some biggot a lesson in humanity.

Opening the subject is preferable to closing it, becoming Rush Limbaugh of
the Left.

I wouldn't offhand from his work in theory and verse find it likely
Perelman is saying anything remotely like that, anything
quietistic....Since your response sounds pretty unsympathetic, I have to
chirp up to say that I thought his points were important.  It is indeed a
matter of macho and "street cred"  to put your politics forward in a brash
in-your-face sort of way.  From working on the left as an activist as well
as poet for 20 years, I'd say that that's often a temptation, whether in
poetry or in life, if your politics are passionate (and especially if they
are, as you see it, oppositional..) It is indeed true that from Pound to
Andrews a rhetoric of heightened tension is used to sandblast poetry from
its esthetic moorings and let politics in.  (Perelman's own work has
enough snickers about its own politically contradictory positions, to
avoid truculence..)

There is a closely-related current of political poets who often enact
progressive politics in a way that talks around suffering and confusion,
rather than ramming thru it with anger; Oppen, Zukofsky and John Taggart
(see his book/sequence Loop).

The mention of Neruda and Mayakovsky is helpful....Altho' I'd take it
somewhere a little different.  The historical specificity of bolshie
Communism gives the range of poets connected to it their own interesting
twist.  Compared to the examples Simon cites, we can put: Oppen; Cesar
Vallejo; and the more densely surrealistic Neruda (especially the early
sections of Residencia in la Tierra, but also Alturas de Macchu Pichu,
which is an atypical part of the Canto General!) This is just to stick to
(literally) card-carrying Communists.  Oh, and another card-carrying red:
Eluard.  The latter group for me are among the poets that from my early
teens helped define how good poetry interacts with the world..That they
did so while actively belonging to as stifling a form of leftism as the
3rd International, is truely commentary on the human spirit, and tends to
give me a whole lot of hope for people, progressive politics and the
possibilities of poetry...Maybe even for myself.

I'm glad that Templeton and Perloff have turned the discussion to
playwrights.  Dear Fiona and Marjorie, I'm sorry that you will be in the UK
and in LA respectively since I am putting on my new play here in San
Francisco on March 6.

"'Political Animals' is Kevin Killian's farce about the 1996 conventions in
which hundreds of cultural and politicial figures (Nancy Reagan, Guy De
Bord, Dorothy Arzner, Liffy Dole, Bill Clinton, Scott O'Grady, Christopher
Reeve, Mary Matalin etc. etc.) converge on two great US cities, San Diego
and Chicago, to promulgate their own dreams of lust, power and despair."
My cast includes the visual artists Kate Delos, Phoebe Gloeckner, Cliff
Hengst, Scott Hewicker, Rex Ray, Michelle Rollman and Wayne Smith; the
poets Norma Cole, Leslie Scalapino and Alicia Wing; the filmmakers Kota
Ezawa, Craig Goodman, and Karla Milosevich; actresses Julia Brashares,
Ethel Chase and Pauline Facciano; and prose writers David Buuck, Mark
Ewert, Nicole Harrison and Kevin Killian.  AND many more.

The Ansel Adams Center for Photography is producing this play for one
evening only, Thursday, March 6 at 7 p.m.  They're at 250 Fourth Street (at
Folsom).  Please call the museum for reservations = (415) 495-7000.   I
know that on that evening John Jesurun and Mac Wellman will be trembling in
trepidation!  Thanks, everyone, please try to come if you'll be in the Bay
Area a week from Thursday.

mark, yknow, maybe i'm a bit punchy, but there really ARE some folks i've
met in academe, and in industry, that i'd like to punch in the snoot...

now as to industry:  in fact there *were* more than a couple of physical
confrontations at the miller brewing co. site where i used to work... in
fact i was threatened on two occasions with physical violence (i shit you
not), and in fact i ended up having---as in HAVING---to ask one of my
"coworkers" who walked up and planted the bottom of his shoe on the side of
my desk, HARD, to 'meet me out in the fucking parking lot'... he declined,
i am happy to report, and the phenomenon ended there...

but i offer this by way of not over-aestheticizing the issues:  there are
STILL very male, very macho environments "out there" where, sad to say,
physical confrontation, largely between males, is, if not the rule, then at
least the subtext... on another occasion, i was in a bar, attending a
going-away-party, when a "coworker" poured an entire beer down the front of
my shirt (at the prompting of his supervisor---"just doing what i'm told,
joe")... took great effort on my part to avoid popping that motherfucker,
to simply walk away... in fact, i think my behavior on the evening in
question was downright *heroic*, but my more macho side has dreams about
hitting him to this day... the point here anyway is that academe seems to
have institutionalized, as you (and foucault) would suggest, an
anti-violence that provides for other sorts of violence...

i'm not really quite sure which is worse, provided of course i'm not
choosing between a bloody nose and psychological strain... i mean, MY
bloody nose... if i AM so choosing, i guess i'll take the strain, not so
much b/c i'm such a 'civilized' guy, but b/c a bloody nose, yknow, that
really fucking smarts...

best,

In response to the conundrum of the Spicer poem.  I'm not a scholar; a
library professional and social activist and poet, however.

The impulse to destroy, or even hide, doesn't pull as strongly on me,
Kevin...I wonder why... (Spicer has been for me a central inspiration re
what poetry can/should be, for 15 years)  Apart from not being involved
with him as scholar/biographer, what makes me less torn?  Is it that
given Pound, I feel desensitized to the issue--like, we've done that, we
can accept the worst warts on the poets we love, after working the earlier
problem through??

I do feel there is one component:  As a socialist activist I have often
encountered protests of screenings of Birth of a Nation; these are often
taking place on a campus where I work in the library system.  Usually what
these protests say is: we demand that no one ever show this film, and that
people boycott this screening, to help carry this out.  What I realized
long ago, is that it's destructive to tell people they shouldn't know
about racist artworks, or to try to keep them out of the culture.
Speaking against them, is more empowering both for us as users/makers of
art stuff, and as people in a political world.  Somehow I don't feel that
hiding something done by a poet, changes things for the better.  As a
socialist I found it literally insane to tell people to join in
condemning/avoiding a film they had never seen, to avoid seeing it because
some leninist activists TOLD them is had a certain character..What's wierd
is the implication that people can be INFECTED by  the racist or
reactionary character of a work, that they can't protect themselves if
they are "exposed".  (This reminds me again of the discussion of Pound's
fear of infection by the welter of experience he unleashed in the Cantos,
discussed by Bernstein.)

Dear Morality Junkies:  What if Ted Berrigan actually did punch someone
once?  What if a fine, morally pure, socially sensitive poet is mean to
his/her partner or children?  What if he/she has bad taste in movies?  Or
puts ugly art on their walls?  Or occasionally drinks too much?  Or once,
in a moment of frail humanity, said something unkind about someone else?
What if Gertrude Stein voted Republican?  What if she didn't exercise her
right of citizenship and vote at all?  What if she was (or anyone else) is
mean, weak, ill-advised?  What if she were a flatterer or dishonest?
Where does this end?  If we want our writers to be righteous beyond
reason, maybe we need to read... what?  The fact that some misbehave
publically and others (most likely) privately (at least at some point in
their long lives) is a fact of most people's existence on earth.  Even
writers we love.  Sorry folks, but it's true. Of us all.

I'd like to mention that most of this thread, with sharp contributions
from a number of folks, and particularly the Kent/Mark exchange, has been
awfully productive, and a very unusual model of political/poetical debate
done with respect and with people quite often listening to each other in a
non-exclusionary way...Not easily found in outer cyber space, where people
are careless; not often enuff found on the non-poetic left, either, for
sure!

id have to agree with mark on this one too kevin--
im sympathetic to the urge to destroy the poem
(is that protecting
spicer from others
who will/do write
him off as another
worthless antisemite
--or from himself?)
but, yes, that act would have been antithetical to
your task as i understand it.

besides that, could you have destroyed the poem?
or would the poem (& the having destroyed it)
have come to underwrite you efforts as biographer?
i realize theres a sharp difference between these
positions--exposing the poem or concealing it --
& im not suggesting that you would somehow
have legibly re-inscribed the absent poem, or not,
at least, that the re-inscription would be immediately
legible. the question is probably more ethical than
textual, though both. oops, now it sounds like im
questioning yr ethics--damn this language stuff is a
tricky lot. "must...get to...the...point...."

well, unless this was a confession, it sounds as
if you made the right decision, or right by me.

Subject:      syracuse university...
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

thomas, there's a big feature in _the chronicle of higher ed_ (pertaining
to that post forwarded in these regions) about how the creative writing
program at syracuse university is now under attack from various
quarters---from the marxist theory collective there, from grad. students
there, from its former director (now at u of alabama)...

again:  the article, in my view, doesn't do a good job of drawing out the
various subtexts... for example:  the incident that prompted the brouhaha
(the glass of scotch and insult i reported) is surely part of a structural
reality that isn't being examined entirely... there's a reason why donald
morton, colleague of mas'ud zavarzadeh (sp?) at syracuse (who is, last i
knew, teresa ebert's partner---and ebert is at u of albany, where the "red
theory collective" is located who signed that forward protesting the
chronicle piece)---there's a reason why morton is quoted in the
chronicle... and the insult---"stalinist bitch"---is not only a nasty
gendered insult, but it would seem to pick up ("stalinist") on the
theory-creative split that typifies most english depts... in this case,
unreconstructed marxist theory...

wolff has evidently been accused by the former director of the program,
michael martone, of 'driving him [martone] out'... martone suggests that
dobyns (the prof. who through the scotch etc) is being reinstated in part
b/c of wolff, that dobyns should have been fired long ago (which sounds
accurate to me---though i don't trust martone either, b/c he seems to be
taking potshots from afar)... wolff's retort is that he tried to "exert
what positive influence he could" in approaching dobyns about his drinking
problem... at the same time, writer mary karr, who sides with wolff here,
is being accused of using "vulgar language" in class... this latter i can
identify with, having mself chosen not to censor my language practices
(which are clearly working class in many ways)... anyway, the karr issue
is, it seems to me, obscuring some very real structural problems with
master-apprentice teaching, and some specific gender issues that are simply
not reducible to marxist logics of consumption and production...

for example:  dobyns evidently "blew up" in one workshop, "using the 'F'
word in criticizing a poem written by a student about her rape by her
father"... dobyns evidently "explained [to the chronicle] that the poem
didn't work because the student was telling the reader what to think rather
than allowing the poem to evoke feelings"... the student in question ran
weeping from the class...  as many women in creative writing classes will
tell you, this is precisely the sort of male response that denies women the
right to their own 'voices' (setting aside for a second the convention of
'voice'... i am reminded of susan howe's response to olson's poetics in _in
relation_ acts 10)...

it's a MESS, in short... sure, the "red theory collective" is correct in
pointing to structural problems with the hiring of individual 'talents' in
creative writing programs, with the status of 'talent' as a commodity...
but where, precisely, do the marxists stand on this question of gender,
where do they STAND?... i mean, if false consciousness is thereby
dismantled (i say IF---it's not clear that this is about althusserian
ideology), to what end will it lead, if not the rather dogmatic end
suggested by teresa ebert's recent piece in _college english_ (nov. 96 "for
a red pedagogy:  feminism, desire, and need"):  that, over and against
"libidinal pedagogy," "red pedagogy demystifies the seemingly unique
experiences and the supposed autonomy of desire and shows how they are, in
fact, the 'common' effects of the social relations of production in
wage-labor capital"... those of you who teach will note that the instructor
in this latter classroom scenario is clearly just another master, whose job
is to convert students into like subjects... i don't find this especially
liberating, though ebert does make some good points along the way...

one final point:  i have the letter written by jennifer cotter, the student
whom dobyns assaulted with his drink and his mouth... i don't find it
particularly persuasive, b/c it sounds very much as though she wants her
case to be taken as an instance of the effect that the marxist collective
wishes itself to surface... that is, while what happened is in my view
decidedly part of various structural problems, these problems are not
reducible to unreconstructed marxist logic...

but that's just me talking...

best,

joe

Yes, we're all less than perfect...I dunno if most posts have been fixes
for Morality Junkies, though.....
Personally I've thought the passion people on the list have been putting
into these questions pretty politically (& poetically) refreshing,,==

I have another suggestion about how to deal with the Spicer poem and other
objectionable writing. In the not-so-old days the custom was to translate
prurient passages of texts into Latin, so as not to endanger the minds of
those (usually from the lower orders) who had not been uplifted by the study
of, say, Petronius. That would work.
Need I say that I'm being facetious?

Mark Weiss-- actually, since this little joke has been lobbed at several
folks, not just me-- Most of us were trying to use Perelman plus various
responses to his posting as a springboard for some comments of our own;
the point of all those posts was really to carry the exchange
forward..Perelman was a bit of a pretext (..we all use each other, as
pretexts, at times..)

Subject:      violence and the threat of violence
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Years ago, when I still lived in Brooklyn, I bought a car stereo at Crazy
Eddie's and took it to the mechanic who did their installations. He told me
what the service would cost me, which was pretty hefty. I was more than a
little annoyed. "But they told me at the store that installation was
included," I told him.

"It isn't, but you can take it up with Sal, the guy fixing his car over
there. He's the dapertment manager."

So I went to talk to Sal, who got incredibly angry, and accused me of lying.
"Wait a minute," I said, "I'm not accusing _you_ of anything. You weren't
the salesman."

"He works for me. You accuse him you gotta deal with me."

Things went from bad to worse. Pretty soon I was threatening to talk to
Sal's boss, and Sal was threatening to beat me up, to which I countered that
if he did I'd call the police. There didn't seem to be any end in sight to
the downward spiral.

Then I was afflicted with a rare moment of clarity. I should have known
better--I lived in the neighborhood. And I did social work with working
class people every day. Sal didn't really want to beat me up, and I didn't
really want to have him arrested or fired. We were invoking the power moves
of our respective social classes. Sal was working class--he had not been
raised with the assumption that he could appeal to higher authorities to do
his dirty work for him, and he probably thought it dishonorable to do so. I
was middle class--I had been raised to abhor violence and the threat of
violence, but also to assume that I had the power to call in the troops.

We were both doing the same thing, but in different languages. In my
language Sal's provocation was to be taken more seriously than intended, as
was mine in Sal's language. But they were both just power moves.

This whole series of reflections took a lot less time than it takes to write
about it. I realized that I was just venting: I would have to pay anyway.
What was the point of the argument? Was my honor at stake? So I backed off,
and we each went to our corners.

Afterwards I reflected that I wasn't sure who was being more violent. I was
threatened with a bloody nose. Sal was threatened with jail and loss of
livelihood.

So here we are narrow-casting to one an-other, poets mind you.
Whispering
in each others ears. Reading tightly, together. Because if we really
othered the other, as opposed to just othering them they'ed be, well,
us, only different, not even poets. And what of that difference? Are
there any *others* on the list, out there in list-land, or is that
an-other list on all the ships at sea? Broadcast information, or is that
misinformation, one would think, is speed itself. Anon.

The best sound quality broadcast is the unpacking of the libraries
frequency. Tuned in on the dial the personal histories of the intimacies
and assignations shared with a lover who wee discover, post-coital, was
given to the ressentiment, of, say, jew hating, which of course is more
severe than the manufacture of simulated pink-triangles of the
human-immunodeficency virus. We can par-don that rolling-stock
broad-cast
because our library is ordered. Safe-sex. Slowed down to a card-catalog
where the
surgical aesthetic of beauty and death are kept in different drawers. A
retrovirus in check in a meduium that can quickly and actually do harm
to (other) people.

Slow.

Rapid insemination and spectral speed regimes. So we move TOO FAST in
this regime. A diagnosis. A metastasis. An opportunistic infection. Not
post-modern, or post-auschwitz, but post-pound,
post-pound-consciousness, post-pound-revelations, post-pound-nuanced
analysis or is that past not post(?), what you and I are not about I
assure you; rather than past(?) is that post-gulf-war, or is it post
sarejevo, post-stonewall, or, maybe *during*, live broadcast, during the
riot, like Rodney King ventriloquized in the voice of the LAPD during
the riot to broadcast on the too fast ouija board, "can't we all just

Those in P-zones and P-zoos will be held to account when it is clarfied.

voice, they turn on more current. . . .

"They git that way readin' jew papers for 40 years. They git that way

Join me on that band-width methodone program, you morality junkies, that
methodone of 'regardless of race' that too is addictive, the liberal
delirium tremens of 1st world satiation leading in the majority of cases

"The tension between the radio experience as a private experience and a
public one is at the heart of radio ideology. Radio and telephone were
the first electrical "personal appliances," . . . Radio gave the sense
of intimacy with electricity, a sense of control over technology: at the
same time radio's wirelessness, the invisibility of its method, made it
subject to the greatest mystifications  . . . In a prophetic misreading,
the American Federal Communications Commission officials who monitored
and transcribed the Italian broadcasts didn't recognize the word Celine
and recorded it as Stalin, thus substituting a political totalitarian
for what is now recognizable the quite specific telephonocentric of a
French fascist aesthetic." Alice Kaplan, _Reproductions of Banality:

Dear Joseph,

 There are indeed many turns to self-righteousness. The phrase was
William Northcutt's, who wrote:

I understand all the fuss about Dorn. What he and T. Clark published re:
AIDS is a horrible thing. I'd like to hear their side of it if any of
you
have contact with them and they're interetested in responding--or have
they
elsewhere?

But on the other hand, it seems to me this list has taken a
self-righteous
turn. I admit, I don't know much about Dorn personally, but in my last
decade + experience in the university, assholes abound and poets abound,
and sometimes one is a subset of the other. Actually, it seems to me the
university is concretising its self-righteous turn.

Among the subjects that seems to always come up, and for good reason, is
Pound.
I agree, Pound's behavior was evil, no matter how much anyone finds
reasons--Italian isolation, etc. But on the other hand, telling the one
story, as Bob Perelman has done, gets only one part of the job
done--that
is, I disagree with whoever it was who lauded Perelman's book on Genius.
Perhaps the Stein, Zuk, and Joyce chapters are okay, but I find the
chapter
on Pound a bit trendy, a bit facile. Perelman takes the Pound of the
late
1930s on and reads backwards, mostly ignoring the Pound whose reaction
to
the avarice that brought on WWI prompted him to take  some admirable
chances in his early Cantos; I find Perelman's book equally as underdone
as
those books which look at some of Pound's earlier thought and try to
press
that over the truely evil shit in Pound's later work.

I like Perelman's poetry.

I like Dorn's poetry too, especially Slinger.

I don't think one has to be schizophrenic to see in the work something
useful and something humane, and to see at the same time that it may be
set
beside something awful in the human being who wrote it, or even in the
very
next line of the poetry itself.

Rather than seeing the world in Hollywood black and white, wouldn't it
be
more useful to explore the complications of "good" and "evil" (as
they've
been labled on this list)? In the case of someone such as William
Faulkner,
for example. It's true of his work that his portrait of blacks is
sometimes
terribly condescending, and he wasn't exactly an advocate of the Civil
Rights movement in the South, but it doesn't mean that his work doesn't
have moments which might teach some biggot a lesson in humanity.

Opening the subject is preferable to closing it, becoming Rush Limbaugh
of
the Left.

William Northcutt

I think it is more righteous than self righteous. And i for one prefer

Mark Weiss's long message on Neruda and Stalinism in the USA was really
interesting. Thanks for that.

I am wondering, though: did USAmericans really believe that the overthrow
of the government in Guatemala was somehow not done by the USA? I have
never heard of anyone outside the USA that did not know that from the start.

Oh, and if I remember rightly, Neruda helped the killers of Trotsky get out
of Mexico, didnt he? Or am I mixing up a couple of things?

     This seems to go on and on so I can't help adding my bit.  In my reading
of events more harm comes from those who seek perfection in themselves and
others.  I'll keep my feet of clay, allow them theirs, and cast not the
first line:

     "I can no longer tell
      Which is beast
      Which man"
         Akhmatova, Requiem

This is not to say that all sins are equal.

I remember the coverage of the Guatemala coup at the time--big spread in
Life magazine that was unadulterated CIA feed. In my family everyone
knew--but we also knew that the CIA probably had something to do with the
Dodgers losing the World Series. I doubt very much that the average
estadosunidense, as they call us in Guatemala (really) questioned the
official story, and I'd guess that most of my fellow citizens who know where
Guatemala is still don't.
As to Neruda's complicity with that gang, quien sabe? But I'd hope we don't
go back into innuendos without presenting the evidence. The world is sad
enough as it is.

Subject:      the misunderstood fugitive

Dear Kevin, Luigi-Bob, Maria Damon, & everybody:

It was not my intention, in the least, to use the term 'fugitive' in any kind
of pejorative sense, merely as--especially re: publications--as shorthand for
here today, gone tomorrow.
Like, for instance, the Piero Heliczer issue of Dennis Cooper's magazine
Little Caesar--late Seventies, early Eighties? --which I lost & wd dearly
like to retrieve (if anyone has a spare, or knows where one might be found,
please backchannel)...

As for the Rolling Stock AIDS number, it certainly was an instance of
ill-informed and hence ignorantly excessive satire--*failed* satire, in every
which sense: artistic, political, civil, human.  I have always regarded it on
a par with was it The Realist's? piece on the Kennedy assassination
--offensive sledgehammer grossness.  Part of a perhaps peculiarly U.S. strain
of 'oppositional' journalism harking back to the Sixties (when it did have a
few brilliant exponents-- the late Terry Southern comes to mind, and R.
Crumb, of course).  But to whom should, and would, creators of such
misbegotten garbage now apologize?

Ah, sigh.  Buenas noches.

Hey, is it okay if I agree with both Kevin Killian AND Maxine Chernoff? (oh,
David Bromige, where are you?)
But--I think I wanted most to respond to Michael Magee today.
(any relation to Kevin Magee. Whatever happened to kevin Magee?)
in reference to Berrigan getting his tough guy machismo from O'Hara--Well, I
will try to brackett the question of Berrigan for now, but this will be hard
to do, because a comparison has been urged and to me it seems that O'Hara
definitely has less of this tough guy machismo than Berrigan--especially
considering the fact that he was writing in a generally more macho time
(Olson, and others) while Berrigan--though Tulsa--i still associate with the
influx of many women writers (Mayer, Notley, Waldman, etc.). Of course,
O'Hara didn't hang out with writers as much as Berrigan did....but he did
hang with many female painters. Yeah, Mike, maybe compared to Warhol O'Hara
is less "stereotypically gay" but not compared to, say, Ginsberg.....(and how
stereotypically gay was even warhol?)....
One thig I notice in my recent standing still AS sitting in cafes with poets
is a tendency amongst younger poets (those who seem to react against the L
school, or, never were very affected by them in the first place, and tend to
see themselves more in a NYSCHOOL kinda thing, and more of the
O'Hara/Berrigan/Mayer (and not even Ashbery as much) thing)
to see O'Hara as primarily a poet who wrote about his friends, etc. I call
this reading O'Hara THROUGH Berrigan...and sometimes there is a tendency to
accuse O'Hara--again IN CONTRAST to Berrigan--as CLASSIST, and I've been
wondering if this accusation of O'Hara's alleged classism (but see his essay
on PASTERNAK!, for instance) may be a subtle kind of homophobia that comes
out of the infinitely more heterosexual aesthetics of later ny school males.
I am not suggesting that one must be rich to be gay or poor to be straight
(or even "cruel to be kind/ in the right measure"), just trying to theorize
history from scant little details of "deep gossip" and
in so doing I see O'Hara can NOT really be pinned down to a kind of
homosocial machismo that you, Mike, seem to attribute to him. I am not
denying that there are elements there of this, but they seem--especially for
his time (more the 50's than the 60's) to be not dominant......(his love for
pollock being no greater than his love for frielecher or hartigan, or even
joan mitchell, who are still quite underrated painters viz-a-viz the great
DeKooning and yet more Picasso retrospectives at MOMA....)......Chris S.

re: Chris Stroffolino's comment, "O'Hara can NOT really be pinned

attribute to him."

Chris, I actually agree with you.  I was posing the O'Hara/machsimo issue
as a question rather than as a statement since it seems to be around as an
issue - Gooch makes alot of O'Hara's attraction to heterosexual "macho"
men in his very chatty biography and there's certainly some truth to that.
BUt I like your notion that some of the conventional wisdom on O'Hara is a
consequence of reading him through Berrigan.  Thanks for the response.

I first heard about Dorn's madness almost ten years ago, when someone told
me that Creeley had been awarded the AIDS prize. I didn't understand the
frightening logic behind his vile attitudes and it wasn't until Kevin's
writing on this was made available to me that I understood the depths of
that problem. I appreciated Kevin's writing and have observed this kind
of thinking in places other than Dorn-world (such as real world). I
wish/hope that K.K.  would post that text here. What else is this list
for? I mean c'mon...

As far as Mr. Northcutt's comment above: Ed & Jennifer Dorn tried to sign
up to Poetics list several times. I deleted them like I would have Hitler,
but to no avail, they kept re-subbing. Eventually, I let them pass
through, with my finger on the "delete" key, I waited expectantly for some
coke-induced froth from his evil lips--did he ever post? A search of the
archives would reveal. As far as I know, they remained on this list until
recently...

Well, Maria, personally, I'd find it easier to accept the proposal
that this discussion was about the intersection of poetry and politics
if anybody ever mentioned any poetry (or, god forbid, poetics). The
actual discussion seems about the intersection of personality and
politics (YAWN!). Let's see, we're makin' a list and checkin' it twice
. . .

By the way, to the guy who named his newfie Moby (sorry, I lost your
name), haven't you heard that Melville's work is now on the proscribed
list because he allegedly abused his wife? Better change the dog's

in response to joel kuszai's post:

"As far as Mr. Northcutt's comment above: Ed & Jennifer Dorn tried to sign
up to Poetics list several times. I deleted them like I would have Hitler,
but to no avail, they kept re-subbing. Eventually, I let them pass

coke-induced froth from his evil lips--did he ever post? A search of the

I think it's very creepy that people are being kept off this list.  I've
actually found this whole discussion very disturbing.  Aren't there more
productive things to do in this forum than get involved with name calling,
etc.?  I mean really-- the "coke-induced froth from his evil lips"?  I've
been tired of this discussion since the idea of punching people out came
up.  It makes me think of something that Robert Duncan says about how you
can't reject Mae West as vulgar or Hitler as the enemy because that
potentiality exists in everybody.  I thought the people on this list were
progressive thinkers and writers--  if Dorn writes nasty crap it's because
he wants a reaction like this-- he's succeeded in getting people to waste
their time talking about him.  yours, lisa jarnot

Thank you, Maxine C. on your comments re: Berrigan and Dorn. I've felt part
of the marginalization of ted's work is less the occasional & mostly
comical references to violence than to his references to his drug taking.
Ted's poetry, in a way, broke the shabby curtain between personal life and
public persona & more of his private life is in their than most poets.
        If you read the bios, folks like lowell, berryman, james wright &
others were as big pillheads as ted, but THEY never wrote a line like "the
pills aren't working" in fact, the keepers of their flames admit to their
drinking problems (still ok in the culture), but keep drug use out the
narrative (indication of an evil character).
        As for the question of violence: the potentiality of giving and
receiving a knuckle sandwich was and still is part of the world of working
class men (and if we go by G. Lakoff's theory that our metaphors shape our
outlook on the world--the "jokey" violent metaphors that I always here on
the street on hoboken between young men makes sure there is ready cannon
fodder out there in the world). Ted, I think, struggled with that
inheritance -- his workshop comment "The only men capable of writing a real
love poem are gay men" reflects some of that conflict
        Around '69, ted was beaten up by two punks in Tompkins Square Park
-- an incident he referred to in interviews and letters. It changed him
somewhat-- tom clark feels it brings a dramatic change in his Late Returns
memoirs.
        I think serious appreciation of Paul Blackburn's poetry was ruined
at the time of the publication of the collected poems by speculation of his
outlook towards women, etc -- without attempting to contextualize his
stance against the attitudes of the time (a marvelous, tho' unknown account
of gender relations in the Lower East Side in the early 60's occurs in
Barbara Giurzatti Harrison's memoir of growing up as a Jehovah's
Witness(?).

Mark:

YOU should have kicked HIS ass!

No wait, I am being rash. Here comes a rare movement of clarity  . . .

In the lingo of  the neighborhood I grew up in, when we discussed "power moves
of respective social classes," etc. etc., you got "psyched out."   A psych-out
is a line in the sand (in the desert of intimidation) which the loser won't
cross.  It's my bet that that line is (or was) policy at Crazy Eddie's.  In
fact, if you had crossed just two more lines in that office you may have got
what you wanted.   A threat to call the police may work in some arenas, but
here you were misplaying your cards.  (How many metahpor-cliches can I go?)

Actually, if you HAD called the police, 1) you would have had to leave the
office-- you could hardly say, "oh shoot, Crazy Eddie, can I borrow your phone
to call the cops on you?" and the game would have changed while you were gone,
and 2) the cops probably would have arrested YOU for causing a disturbance.
While you were sitting in the cruiser you would have seen Officer McGruff
admiring your recent purchase and Eddie handing it to him for his own as a
token of goodwill.  No, the cops would have been no use to you there and
therefore your threat was no good.

Those offices--or shops, whatever-- are usually pretty messy. Now, I don't know
if you would have been capable of kicking this guy's ass or anybody's ass for
that matter, or not.  From the tone of your posts you seem like a peaceful guy,
not the ass-kicking type. But like I say, those offices are pretty messy and
what you lack in violent behavior or ill-will you can make up for in brief
spasms of psychotic tendencies; say, grabbing a broom, a crow bar, or one of
those little gum ball or pistachio dispensers, and slamming it down on the
man's desk as furiously as possible while screaming,  "I'm not going to pay a
lot for this muffler."

You needn't worry about Crazy Eddie-- or whatever the hell the guy's name is--
attacking you because it was never his intention in the first place. They
probably contract out work like that-- have someone else kick your ass in a
7-11 lot somewhere and then steal the radio back when they're done or
something.  This guy is a businessman after all, he can't spend the rest of the
day selling stolen car parts and dealing with customers with your teeth
sticking out of his knuckles and your blood all over his shirt.

Anyway, I noticed in your post a big void: you say both of you went to your
respective corners to reflect but it seems only you did.  The other guy was
probably figuring out what kind of time he was going to be set back by dealing
with you.  Ultimately, it would have been more "dishonorable" to let you get
the better of him than it would be to appeal to a higher authority.

What did happen anyway?  If you paid for the installation, you got suckered. I
mean that dispassionately and there's no other way to put it.  And the
rationalization you employed that cost you so much money greatly exaggerated
your power in the situation, and greatly underestimated his.  Did you really
think you could have him arrested or fired?  ho boy. . .

Subject: violence and the threat of violence

Years ago, when I still lived in Brooklyn, I bought a car stereo at Crazy
Eddie's and took it to the mechanic who did their installations. He told me
what the service would cost me, which was pretty hefty. I was more than a
little annoyed. "But they told me at the store that installation was
included," I told him.

"It isn't, but you can take it up with Sal, the guy fixing his car over
there. He's the dapertment manager."

So I went to talk to Sal, who got incredibly angry, and accused me of lying.
"Wait a minute," I said, "I'm not accusing _you_ of anything. You weren't
the salesman."

"He works for me. You accuse him you gotta deal with me."

Things went from bad to worse. Pretty soon I was threatening to talk to
Sal's boss, and Sal was threatening to beat me up, to which I countered that
if he did I'd call the police. There didn't seem to be any end in sight to
the downward spiral.

Then I was afflicted with a rare moment of clarity. I should have known
better--I lived in the neighborhood. And I did social work with working
class people every day. Sal didn't really want to beat me up, and I didn't
really want to have him arrested or fired. We were invoking the power moves
of our respective social classes. Sal was working class--he had not been
raised with the assumption that he could appeal to higher authorities to do
his dirty work for him, and he probably thought it dishonorable to do so. I
was middle class--I had been raised to abhor violence and the threat of
violence, but also to assume that I had the power to call in the troops.

We were both doing the same thing, but in different languages. In my
language Sal's provocation was to be taken more seriously than intended, as
was mine in Sal's language. But they were both just power moves.

This whole series of reflections took a lot less time than it takes to write
about it. I realized that I was just venting: I would have to pay anyway.
What was the point of the argument? Was my honor at stake? So I backed off,
and we each went to our corners.

Afterwards I reflected that I wasn't sure who was being more violent. I was
threatened with a bloody nose. Sal was threatened with jail and loss of
livelihood.

oh jeez, where did personality come in?  i don't know these people, only
what they say or do in the public realm.  and as for "morality," (making
the list and checking it twice) these are not matters of abstract morality
or a debased sort of judgmentalness.  if a guy is misogynistic, why wd i
hang around him unless there were strong incentives in the area of learning
something, or unless somehow i cd pass as a guy, or unless i cd use that
misogyny to my advantage (a la groupie-ism).  if a guy's anti-semitic,
what's in it for me to stick around?  sometimes there's something worth
hanging around for, sometimes not.  why are the pragmatics so hard to
grasp? is it that folks don't believe there are practical consequences to
someone's jewbaiting, woman-hating, etc, so that these are abstract ethical
issues?

Surely you jest....the media in this country simply lies pretty much
outright about most issues re social policy at home and imperial
machinations abroad.  Not because the lies are prescribed and required, a
la the Stalinist systems, but because folks are hired to do the reporting
who will actually believe the US government and not independent data.
Most ordinary working-class people (the majority) don't have a source
available against which to check the NYT, CNN etc.  The much more recent
and obscenely flagrant instance of Chile, most citizens don't in any
meaningful sense "know about", altho' of course the facts are "right
there" in the public sphere.  The thing about the current forms of
consciousness characteristic of our society, that's so peculiar, is that
there is no direct relationship (at least in this country) between the
formal availability of data and points-of-view, and their ability to make
an impact on society. (something non-mainstream poetry people should be
familiar with from other contexts!)

Please - I don't know if anyone was joking but the idea of keeping Dorn or
anyone off this list vis-a-vis his or her politics is reprehensible, not
funny as a joke.

I think it would be wise to disconinue these threads; they're getting a
bit like witch-hunting. None of us are pure. For that matter the thread
about Pound has already cycled through the list before.

I'd be interested in hearing more about the influx of women poets into the
New York School. I think the same thing happened in film, Maya Deren etc.
notwithstanding. There was a real shift in experimental cinema that opened
the whole field (if it is such) to an entirely different form of content..

Brava, Lisa.

I think we've beat the dead horse quite to death. Dorn's lesser sins - which
I am not under any circumstances condoning, esp. with a brother who's
HIV-positive - have been magnified here to assume the status of sacrificial
scapegoat for the Sins of Poetry at large. A dubious notion, to be sure. The
outrage Dorn's words provoke in us points at bottom toward a sense of
betrayal many seem to feel - how could one of "our own" do this? I agree
with Chomsky: writers and intellectuals do carry a greater responsibility to
the community because of the nature of their work; their ability to discern,
etc.  And clearly Dorn has not lived up to this very well, at least not
recently. But when I look at him at the front of the classroom (I'm taking
Brit Lit 1 with him this semester) I don't see a monster at all. Rather,
just another human being, somewhat muddled (the class has been a real
disappointment to me).  I like Lisa's Duncan quote. Keep the critical acumen
baby - throw out the vindictive bathwater.

Is this a joke? That Ed and Jennifer Dorn tried to subscribe to the
list and were repeatedly censored out? If so, I'd suggest this
discussion that people are "getting tired of" has acquired a new

Thanks, Dean Taciuch, for the poem and the line - "and the time spent will
be the poem."  I have a question for whoever about using citation/found
language.  Probably because of my academic background I have a fear about
using other people's language without spelling out what is quoted--even when
I recombine the words rather than quote per se.  So in the past I've usually
specified when language was quoted.  But I'm working on a long piece that
incorporates language from Darwin and various gardening texts and find
myself wanting to use the language without also specifying which words come
from where.  I'm not sure I understand why I want to do this, or what it
means to the poem.

Is there a difference between using quotation marks or some other indicator
of source and not indicating the source specifically but treating the words
as found language?  How does this work?  I don't mean technically how it
works, but what kind of difference does it make to the poem or the reader?
the writer?

Just something I've been wondering about.  Sherry

        I have to say I somewhat disagree with db's interpretation of
possible outcomes to Mark's situation (though, db, I imagine from your tone
that you are a little tongueincheek), largely because I don't believe the
popular ideologies of auto repair shops being nec. messy and blue collar
workers having a nod and wink, free merchandise relationship with the "blue
collar" cops.

        But I do like the continuation of the discussion along lines of
"speech genres":

>In the lingo of  the neighborhood I grew up in, when we discussed "power moves
>of respective social classes," etc. etc., you got "psyched out."

        Which continues one of Mark's points, namely that:

>We were both doing the same thing, but in different languages. In my
>language Sal's provocation was to be taken more seriously than intended, as
>was mine in Sal's language. But they were both just power moves.

        Two different classes making the same point at each other: and the
languages are both saying the same thing and, as Mark points out later,
entirely different things as well:

>Afterwards I reflected that I wasn't sure who was being more violent. I was
>threatened with a bloody nose. Sal was threatened with jail and loss of
>livelihood.

        I wanted only to point out how this story about a dialogue between
classes beautifully points out the complexity of the interaction between
language and the world. One the one hand the two languages meet as the
individuals meet: the different speech genres are understand, translated in
the immediate context: both people know what the other is getting at: "I
really want you to install this thing for free." "I really don't want to."
But on the other hand, the speech genres are mired in and drag with them
their specific (according to class) social heteroglossia: the threat of a
punch in the nose could actually become a punch in the nose, the threat of
calling the cops could actually become a phone call. And here the utterances
diverge wildly. So in this way language carried within it not only a model
for looking at group interaction (played out in a mutual reinforcing of
class in a manner similar to Satre's discussion in the _Critique_ of how
different economic/social classes gain their self-identification by
identifiying other classes), but ALSO a model for how language may be seen
not merely as an abstract system of signifier/signified, as a structural or
textual system of analysis, but also as the pathway of interaction between
that abstract system and the material consequences in the concrete, daily
history of the world.

        With this in mind, it is worth looking at the change in view
effected by Michael Boughn in a neighbor thread when he charges the
discussion as being not about "poetry" and politics, but about "personality"
and politics. What effect does this change have on the proceeding material?

        In haste,

Los Angeles poets Paul Vangelisti (editor of _Ribot) and Martha Ronk (who,
alas, doesn't yet have her own magazine) flew up to San Francisco for a
reading at Canessa Park Gallery on Sunday.  Host Avery E.D. Burns introduced
the two poets together and they briefly read from their (relatively) recent
Sun & Moon books _State of Mind_ (Ronk) and _Nemo_ (Vangelisti).  Paul then
left the table and let Martha carry on with selections from _Destiny in
L.A._ (based on _The Tale of Genji_) and a new ms, _Run On_.  After a break,
Paul returned to read from a work whose name I got distracted while writing
down and can't remember now.  Sorry.

Some lines I picked up of Martha's were:

their eyes unnervingly swerved
I don't find you behind any eyes you open
I can stir the air
my powdered face nodding to the powdered moon
I'll catch the moon in the poisoned water of a silver bowl, and drink it down
the air came down to meet the paper
the night is the waking blank
as if knees were a causal principle for ground
superimposed is the statue alive with birds
things break under every stone
backed to the wall, you think what you mean will come out of your mouth

Paul's lines included:

I cheered villains and loved no one but God, who I suspected had gone out at 5.
angels are privileged in name only
are married angels especially misnamed?
space (noun)--1. see time
love is a closet turned off and on
traffic is looking up and down the stupid

There were commemorative cards made by John McBride and other printed poetry
from each poet given to all the guests in attendance, who, for those keeping
track (for social histories or to gather other impressions of the reading
for posterity) included Leslie Scalapino, Brian Lucas, Aaron Shurin, George
Albon, Fran Herndon, Benjamin Hollander, Mary Sullivan-Roark, Eric Selland,
Candice (who was in the same class as Mary at Santa Cruz, but neither of
them can remember which one), Barbara Guest, Mary Margaret Sloan, Spencer
Selby, Norma Cole, Carol Snow, Stephen Ratcliffe, the aforementioned John
McBride and, I'm told, although I haven't yet been introduced to her
personally, Fanny Howe.

I've only been able to read the list sporadically of late, so maybe i
shld keep quiet--but i can't.  I agree that there is a danger of
holier than thou attitudinizing in the effort to discuss the "sins" of
poets.  The process can easily degenerate into unproductive
fingerpointing.  At the same time, i'm amazed at how ready some people
are to consider any discussion of ethics as a necessarily self-righteous,
misguided and "pc" sort of maneuver.  We do talk about the "Pound problem"
a lot on this list, and i think for many of us that's because we know
precisely that we are talkinga about ourselves, and about poetry, and not
just about some unexplainable rogue fascist.  Perelman, for example,
makes it clear in his Pound chapter that he is writing about Pound because
Pound has been central to his (Perelman's) development as a poet:

"I've learned to read his language and have absorbed his fervor concerning
words; I no longer want to savor decontextualized lyricism.  Certainly,
the vividness of his struggle ot make each word both new and true to
history has been a powerful influence on poetry in America.  Pound's
language  presenets a charged image of speed and lucidity; this charge
is valuable for the future of poetry.  But I want the full dynamics of
Poundian light to be acknowledged; what it illuminates is always
accompanied by a phobic shadow."

I think of a lot of use feel--as poets, readers, critics--that we, and
poetry, *have* to deal with that shadow, that historically speaking
poetry has too often assumed a privilege to itself (call it
"decontextualized lyricism" if you like) that it can no longer afford.
It's clear to me too that when we're talking about Pound we are also
often talking, either implicitly or explicitly, about the Holocaust,
about what it means to write poetry before, during, after Auschwitz.
That's a fact of *our* global history that is inescapable exactly *now*
as we continue to struggle with whit the question of globalness itself.
But, still, when i say Pound's question is "our" question i want to say,
yes, that we can't just read him as the evil other--but i also want to
say that we can and should examine the man, and the poetry, carefully to
see where he goes wrong.  Pound is central to my understanding of poetry--
there's simply no way for me *not* to ask these questions.  In my own
work, which deals quite a lot with the thirties, it has been illuminating
(to me) to see the various personal, political, and poetical routes
taken through the period of fascism's rise.  I think Pound had a lot of
genuine care for the plight of the world in a period of crisis--and his
response was to become a fascist.  William Carlos Williams, in thrall
to Pound in so many ways--and sympathetic at many points to Pound's
social critique--explicitly refuses this development, and launches an
attack on, and extremely compelling diagnosis of, Pound's fascism--at
a relatively early point, 1941.  Moreover, he does this throught a reading
of Pound's poetry (specifically the opening of Canto XXX) that never
denies the beautry of that poetry, even as it also never hesitates to
read it for its ethical and political import.  The beauty of the poem,
Williams concludes, is to be found in "a pleasure and pain equally
balanced which we cannot resolve."  We owe it to ourselves, and to poetry,
to acknowledge both that pleasure and that pain.  WCW might not have
been able to come to his (crucial) insight if he hadn't thought so hard
about that conflict.  And history isn't over yet.  We've got our own
historical difficulties to struggle with, and our own poetry to write.

I agree with Ms. Jarnot -- once we get to "coke-induced froth from evil
lips" we really have to step back for a while. Every so often there's
glimmers of passionate intelligence regarding this topic, and then
garbage. The thought of anyone censoring any presence on this list is
repulsive.

Lots of people have written in to express their frustrations with this
continuing topic. For any of us who know Ed it's been frustrating for
other reasons, mainly for reasons of unjust character assassination. I
knew and mourned Steve Abbott myself, Kevin; in fact, I was with him in
the Dorns' kitchen eating breakfast one morning in about 1985, a very
pleasant interlude before we both got back on the road to California from
some "beat convocation" at Boulder. I assure Maria that there are a
multitude of reasons to "hang around" this particular poet, and many, many
things to be learned; I have to say that in twenty years of off-and-on
friendship my Jewishness was never the occasion for any Jew-baiting,
and that his provocative manner doesn't discriminate: he'll take on
anyone or anything, but his only enemy is sanctimoniousness. We can
talk about misanthropy, but any special pleader is out of luck. I'm sorry
he's offended some of you, but I also think that thin skin is seldom a
virtue and can often lead to virulent misunderstandings, as evidenced by
some of these postings.

Let me close by quoting an early essay by Ed, "A Cup of Coffee," collected
in _Views_ from Four Seasons Press in San Francisco, 1980. It dates from
the same time as a letter quoted earlier on this list, but has the virtue
of being his own words and thoughts, not what someone else accused him of.

"Negroes, Mexicans, Indians, Whites don't seem awfully special. It is just
that, black brown white, divisions, not complex, subject to broad and
crude considerations only. A god-damn cup of stinking coffee at Walgreens.
Pew! I am ashamed that my brothers get stopped because of their color or
the way they dress. It seems simply correct that Mississippi and Alabama
and South Africa be occupied. If it were my decision, those places and a
few others would be occupied tomorrow. Talk IS cheap. Talk about 'human
rights' is particularly cheap. Rights have nothing to do with general
colors, shapes of eyes or forms of noses. Never. Anyone might be in
danger, or might be safe, but that will be determined by the incredible
meanness with which America handles its people, always has handled them.
The ethic is behavioral. I am a poet. It seems to me a point of honor and
deep responsibility that I not number among my friends a cop, or a doctor
or lawyer, or a President of the United States, or the head of an insane
asylum, or a gangster. Or anyone who thinks Negroes should stay in their
place and be lynched. In the meantime, how I take any given man will be my
own affair, always subject to more critical factors, how he carries his
body, the cast of his eyes, the tone and cadence of his voice. Race IS an
exotic recognition, mostly visual, and always a momentary interest."

joel k., i have to ask you this publicly:  did you really prevent the dorns
from subbing to poetics?...

that's a mistake i think---alan is right (he, uhm, beat me to the punch)...

but really now:  we all know that poetics is a "private" list of sorts, but
exclusion based, say, on verifiably hateful speech is just not, in my view,
the right thing to do...

let me put it this way:  if a neonazi poet wants to participate around
here, that's OK with me... let me be clear:  i despise neonazis, as i'm
sure do the rest of you... now when said poet contributes in a way that
reveals neonazi predisposition, why then we can, each of us to our liking,
publicly correct said predisposition, or attempt to... i might argue, in
another context, that this is our *obligation*... in any case, i have
*faith* in our combined capacity, as a list of caring human beings, to
generate the right moral-ethical-political response collectively... i doubt
sincerely that permitting such an individual into these spaces will
"corrupt" what i take to be the goodwill of the list in general... and in
fact if i thought that the poetics folks, whatever our individual
differences, were not collectively of good conscience, i wouldn't be here
mself... and if i saw some "us" leaning in obviously hateful directions, i
would in any case speak out, immediately, to that effect...

reconsider, please...

all best,

I find that I use a number of facial expressions since I write while
standing or pacing about my room. It's almost as if I am "acting" the
lines. At times, I hear the cadence first and I mumble that to myself and
then try to find the words that fit. Imagine a conductor walking among the
musicians. That's what I look like.

I think it's fine to move on, alright....But contrary to the
fashionable dissing that's going on, lots of folks who posted on this
should be commended--A very large percentage of 'em really weren't
primarily interested in character-attacks on Dorn or others--just trying
to work out some tangled problems, that are very real, about what it means
to seriously believe that social values & politix have something to do
with poetry.

A rather homoerotic passage, don't you think?  I'd love to know what Dorn's

On Cybermind etc. we've had a policy (which we - Michael Current and I)
agreed on in the beginning, to delete anyone promoting racial/gender/
religious slurring on the list. That is, if someone came on with the
purpose of espousing slurs. Beyond that, it's not our business what any-
one believes; there are some far right folk, far left folk, etc., and
that's fine. I would never ever delete anyone based on knowledge of their
beliefs; that's out of the question.

As a footnote, you might know that there have been groups similar to
alt.tactical.strategy that "attack" email lists with the purport of
bringing them down, derailing them. As an aol list owner, I have add-
resses (which are accurate; I've seen these people in action), and these
have had to be added to the site ban slot on listserv. But that's the
extent of it.

okay, now we're talking STUFF! i think (because i've never looked) that
when i begin to write a poem my eyes do most of the talking.  i hope that
my tongue moves around between my lips like i've seen kids do when they're
trying to concentrate on their writing or maybe just like some cats i've
seen where the tongue just stays there, slightly poking out.

when i'm in the middle of writing a poem my ears do most of the talking.
And when i'm talking my talking does most of the writing. see Lisa Douglass
("I hates speech").

when i'm eating a poem my mouth does most of the talking, though i'm hard
to understand--thus the seeming opaqueness of some of my poems.

Jordan, i love your questions. they're kinda like that episode of NIGHT
STAND WITH DICK DIETRICK (which is a parody of daytime talk shows) where
Dick shows his camping video where he mistakes a cocker spaniel puppy for a
bear cub. when the video ends his guest says "Dick! Don't you know the
difference between a bear cub and a cocker spaniel!" and dick says "No. but
i love these! what IS the difference between a bear cub and a cocker
spaniel?" and the guest starts crying and then says "My mother was killed
by a bear!" To which dick, looking puzzled, asks, "that's the punch line?"

that's the punch line,

        Many thanks to Lisa Jarnot and Maxine Chernoff for their letters.
        The spectre of censorship and violence being raised is
disturbing--encountered a few times--back in late Sixties running a mimeo
zine in basement banned by high school and attacked for a week by
Manchester Union Leader on front page for a week--(only to be called by
Library of Congress wanting a copy--)--and in Seventies doing book
reviews for Gay Community News in Boston--an editor was killed--and the
premises looted then fire bombed--
        Being told at restaurants half empty there were no seats for my
first wife and I--(no dirty half and mixed breeds allowed)
        had a strange kind of halfwaking dream--with voice over by
Nicholas Cage--in the manner in which he narrates his dreams in the film
Raising Arizona--and what would future biographers do--with the letters
of the gentle religious poet who threated violence--and the poet who
taped a critic and threatened its use in a debate--would these be taken
out of the bio?--and onward the voice moved through many a time and place
and came to that accused cleric killer and college robber M. Francois
Villon--what to do with him?--who wrote these lines:

        I never work and yet I go all out
        To acquire wealth which I don't want,
        Who speaks most kindly irritates me most,
        Most truthfully will lie to me the most,
        The person is my friend who makes me think
        That a white swan is a black crow,
        He who harms me thinks he helps me out,
        Falsehood, truth, to me they're both the same,
        I remember all things and can't conceive of one,
        Warmly welcomed, rebuffed by everyone.

(from "Ballade" in   The Poems of Francois Villon french and english
edition
Translation and introduction by Galway Kinnell.  NY:  Signet Classic,
1965: 185-7)
        This world is one of violence and censorship.
        To be opposed to this--does it make sense to threaten these?
        The two go hand in hand.
        A few years ago, in a weekly group for dealing with violence at
the Spanish Center, there was a man who spoke constantly of his missing
younger brother--vanished by then for two years.
        One day the young man came in in complete shock. Jeffrey Dahmer
had identified the young man's brother as one of his vicitims. As proof
he gave the police the skull with wired jaw intact--and not a tooth missing.
        And all day long that silenced mouth screamed in the streets of
Milwaukee--from the living mouth of the younger brother.

I thought I was writing about the social meanings of behaviors and how they
can be misinterpreted. Who "won" is rather beside the point.
But I'm macho enough to set the record straight. Crazy Eddie's was a chain
of discount houses, not a person. The garage was in fact an outside
contractor. I could have used the phone. Sal was there using the facilities
to fix his own car on his own time because he was a friend of the
establishment, not as a perc. I was bigger than him. If he'd thrown a punch
I could have insisted on his arrest--that's the law. I know this for a fact:
I've seen it happen, and I've had to bail people out that it's happened to.
The police might have tried to dissuade me from filing charges, but they
couldn't have stopped me. And arrest probably would have resulted in firing.
I have been known to use violence effectively and without reflection when my
safety or the safety of others required. I also didn't think that I stood a
chance with the bureaucracy of that particular establishment. And it was
still a pretty good price for a stereo that now lives in my truck, having
survived two cars.
I was raised on the same streets that Sal was, and by the same rules. But
those are the rules of children and adolescents. We were two guys in our
late thirties; I had the option to change the rules.
I don't care in the slightest what Sal made of all this, nor do I understand
why I should.
There is the question of cost-effectiveness. Predators often pass up prey
because, although they could take the beast, the risk of even minor injury
is too great--being off-peak can mean certain death. That factor is always
in play. But humans, with our long memories, make other calculation. What
would I have gained? "The expense of passion in a waste of shame," as the
man said, "is death in life."
What jungle do you live in?

its an interesting question, sherry. most of my material comes
from other (known) sources--ie, others' speech, books, my own
speech or wrtg done at times other than the wrtg of the poem--
& occurs with varying degrees of intervention, from verbatim
to a radically altered state. but my treatment of that material
has apparently been the opposite of yours, i.e. ive never cited
anything except the epigraph to a book--& even thats about to
go by the wayside i think. suppose this treatment because it
seems to me that all utterance comes from elsewhere--that even
when i speak in my own name etc. so that my wrtg from other
sources could almost be said to b
for the manner in which the self is assembled.

ive thought some about why people do cite. in the context of
academic work it seems to be at times a kind of mooring, either
for the argument (auctores etc) or the article (situating itself
via the conventions of a larger discourse)--but also just a way
of saying read these books. of course theres the plaigarism
thing--a sort of enforced/accepted practical division. in poetry
it probably sometimes has to do with establishing/maintaining/
respecting discreet personal identity, others with a desire to make
evident for political/critical/philosophical reasons an interaction with
certain specific texts--ie "this is a critique [or extension or
appreciation or "reading"] of darwins [tennysons burkes]" etc. as to
how that effects the reader might be something "oh i wonder how
this relates to". wouldnt say its an apparatus external to the poem in
any case, but there can be a variety of possible situations aimed at
with any one device.

im curious to see how others approach this issue.

Subject:      deletion

a while back, i remember someone pennamed "filch" posted what he claimed
was a graffiti exchange he found on bathroom walls.  the graffiti was a
very disturbing plea from a woman to a man for him to meet her -- foreign
names, phones numbers, extremely private if genuine, and, whether genuine
or fake, having absolutely nothing to do with any discussion past or ongoing
on list and a complete intrusion on people's time.  "filch" continued posting
bits of uninteresting, pointless texts along with flamebait.  his posts,
large in number (we only get 50 posts per day... ONLY!  are we crazy!  but
we use them up frequently, so assume some limitations on space to post)
began overwhelming mailings.  after a number of these numerous posts (his
posts always went out in duplicate, making his electronic "loudness" even
more distressing), some of which were over 5 "screen" pages in length (i
remember one was something like 18), he disappeared from list to my great
relief.

shortly after, he confirmed everything i had disliked about the posts and
intolerable mail-bombing by sending out a series of spam letters to members
on list -- spam is, for uninitiated, electronic "junk" mail which,
in sufficient numbers, can and frequently does shut down servors and is
strongly rejected by internet community.  i think it has even been made
illegal.  on receipt of spam, usual mode is to write host of spammer, inform
them customer/client is spamming, and request offending account be closed
down, and, and this is what i mean by STRONG internet disapproval, it usually
is.

several list members did this and i (don't know about anyone else) got a
somewhat threatening, and certainly unpleasant, note from "filch" regarding
my note to his host.

i, too, have some problems with "deletion" of listmembers, but would like
to see possibility kept on if only for the particularly noxious problems
like filch.  the problem with neo-nazi type poster, to my mind, would be
waste of electron space, potential for abuse of list members, and possibility
that some newbie might get taken by innocuous-seeming post and then sucked
into electronic vacuum of energy-sapping correspondence, perhaps even
threatened, before they found out enough to extricate.

i suppose what i am saying at too-great length is that i would reserve
deletion for only VERY extreme cases.  but i would like to see it kept
as a possibility.  i know i wrote to po-listmaster to ask that filch be
taken off -- i believe that was after his four over-20,000 bit postings
caught me off gaurd in my mailreading and tied my computer up for about
10 minutes...

personally, i find myself getting this completely blank, walled over
expression.  i'll blaze away, feel quite frantic if there is any time
pressure on me to go somewhere else (there usually is), and when i get
the last bit i can off, frequently find my hair sticking straight on
end (espeically in the front) where my hands have pushed it back, my
muscles (esp. back) hurt from being completely immobile, and it is at
least forty-five minutes later than i thought...

same editing/ same working on already started poem/ same prose

i cannot KNOW what my expression is, because i can't see myself, but
suspect from facial muscles that i look like an extra from Coma except
my eyes are open.

Eliza: No argument on your comment. But the point/concern with the
apparent censorship of the Dorns on this list is that it happened
before he/she had been able to type a word! I, for one, don't want a
censor deciding for me what I can and cannot have access to on this
wonderful place of discussion. If the matter is true, I propose that
the Dorns be written to, that
apologies be made, and an invitation extended to come aboard.

I dunno, i think it's probably not a joke.  And if not, it's very
disturbing.  No way anyone shld be barred from the list before the
fact, i.e. before actually posting material that might be felt by
list administrators to violate acceptable standards.  And just for
the record, i really admire Slinger, so some of the same things i
said about Pound, about having to read for both the pleasure and the
pain, wld (for me) apply to Dorn too.  steve

i'm sure folks are tired of reading my posts on this thread, but just one
more (i hope) to gloss eliza's post...

if a list member threatens another list member with violence --- if list
conduct devolves even to back and forth name calling --- why then it's
clear to me that some intervention from the moderator/listowner may be
necessary, and that said member(s) may be deleted from the list by
moderator/listowner if the circumstances so deem, esp. if matters don't
improve...

this has happened in the past on lists with which i am familiar... the
relative liberation we may feel in and about these regions should not be
interpreted as license to actually threaten somebody in this space with
harm (i am not alluding to tom mandel's virtual punch, which in retrospect
seems to be aimed at a hypothetical situation and is in this sense a
rhetorical gesture)... i would suggest that the question of threatening in
ascii is less a matter of netiquette than it is a matter touching on the
law, on menacing... as in, menacing missives, menacing phone calls...
though i understand only too well how fuzzy the lines can seem... i've seen
things get really nasty, ("you're an asshole") only to cool off... at the
same time, i've seen listowners who were unwilling, unfortunately, to
intervene even when things escalated to clear threats of personal injury
(generally from men to women, in fact, precipitated by intellectual
disagreement, moving from one medium to another---which, btw, is yet a
further complication)...

anyway... offered as a former listowner, who has seen more than enough
flames for a lifetime, some circling around my own list presence... but
more food for thought, i guess...

best,

joe

Sherry, you might take a look at some of David Gordon's work to see how a
conscientious collagist works with the citation problem. The National
Poetry Foundation is publishing his (ongoing) ten volume work, & you can
see descriptions of it on the NPF website http://www.ume.maine.edu/~npf/
      I also published a piece of the forthcoming fourth volume (or now
perhaps 2-volume sequence) STEM as #8 in my Backwoods Broadsides Chaplet
Series. If you send me your address, I'll send you that--it's essentially 5
pages of poetry, and one of notes documenting sources, but the poetic text
is free of numbers or symbols. Simple, elegant, ethical, legal!  p.s. Which
Darwin texts are you working with?

Sorry for my sarcasm,\ but I find myself sick of reading of people who are
willing to punch other people in the nose. I have to add and delete people
to the list and only one time did I ever delete anyone against their will,
and that was after great distress and consultation with Charles and Loss.

The Dorns wrote and asked if they could sub and I subbed them.

I am not sure, and this is my whole point (if you need to be let in on it)
when it was that they unsubbed. It is a tedium-exhaustium cleaning up
around the poettics store, mopping up after this often brilliant exchage
goign on here--I don't often keep track of when people leave. But a check
yesterday showed there were no longer on the list...

A question: if you are going to say these things, does it change them if
that person is listening? I wish I could say he wasn't...

Filch was the only one I ever deleted although I am sure he eventually
tried and did resub under a different name address. He wrote threatening
stuff to me for a while but figured he gave up (he didn't seem to be
interested in poetics, which is a criteria for list membership, btw)

Ok, glad the post from Joel was a joke (tho one might be forgiven,
perhaps,
for succumbing to the uncertainties--of tone, stance, motive etc--
inherent in this medium, and thus not being quite sure...).

i too
have found the whole "punch in the mouth" approach to ethics pretty
tiresome...

I can certainly second Marjorie's comments. The play
was just spectacular--in true sense. A musical that is
at the same time a remarkably serious satire and slightly
crazed family saga.

I might just mention that Sun & Moon is about
to publish John Jesurun's EVERYTHING THAT RISES
MUST CONVERGE. Sun & Moon is also the publisher
of four of Mac Wellman's plays, a book of his poetry,
and two of his novels.

I'll soon post a listing and poetics discount for
these books.

And----I might add that we are soon to publish
Fiona Templeton's play DELIRIUM OF INTERPRETATIONS.

Dear Alaric Sumner:

Mac is not on this list, but I'll be
glad to forward the comments to him.
Incidentally, this new play, THE LESSER
MAGOO, is the fourth play in what is now
called the CROWTET. The first two plays
of the CROWTET were A MURDER OF CROWS
and THE HYACINTH MACAW (winner of The
America Award for the best drama of 1994),
published together by Sun & Moon Press as
TWO PLAYS. We're reissuing this volume
along with CROWTET 2 (consisting of
SECOND-HAND SMOKE and THE LESSER MAGOO) this
next season.

Maybe it would be a good idea if we all pretended that whoever we're going
after is in fact listening. This wouldn't preclude criticism, but it might
temper it so that it fell short of character assassination.
Except in life and death situations manners do count (and sometimes even then).

Bookfair fire

>From Mr Matthew Evans

Sir, At 3.25 pm on February 3 the Calcutta Bookfair burnt down (News in
brief, February 4). Behind this bald statement lies the fact that in
just over 40 minutes fire, aided by a strong wind, burnt down more than
600 publishers' stands, killing one person and injuring 44.
  The 22-strong delegation of British publishers, led by me, were well
insured and their livelihoods were not threatened by what had happened.
However, of the 600 or so stands destroyed about 400 were manned by
small publishers, publishing in Bengali, whose stands were not insured.
In many cases money had been borrowed to exhibit at the fair.
  Book-purchasing in Calcutta is quite different from elsewhere.  There
are very few bookshops in the city and the fair is the focal point of
the year for these small publishers, where they do about 50 per cent of
their annual business.  Many of not most of them have been ruined by
the fire and imaginative ways must be devised to get them back on their
feet.
  In consultation with the British Council in Calcutta those British
publishers who attended the fair have started a fund to help the
smaller Indian publishers.  We hope that enough money will be raised to
alleviate in some small way the horrific burden on firms which lost
everything.

Yours sincerely.
Matthew Evans,

I'm sorry if my stress about the projects which are coming "to a head"
(and where did that expression come from?) caused me to bristle at some of
the recent discourse on the list. It is an important place for me and I'm
an ardent defender of the poetics-list here (in buffalo, not internet)
even when my friends dismiss it for lack of time, the ennui it often
causes (or presupposes), or for the petit simulacrum of a conversation
that many of us are lucky to have in the college-type-environment. My
stress is related to the fact that I am presently extended about as far as
is humanly possible and am about to hand in 1) chapter of diss. on Mac
Low, Goodman, and "anarcho-formalists" and their theories of education,
among other things. It's actually a couple of chapters but it's "what I
want to do" now, and the first chapter deadline is a bureaucratic
requirement which will enable me to stay here an "indentured servant" at
Buffalo for one more year. 2) another project: a book manuscript, for
which the publisher has been wanting for some time, edited by me (of all
people). 3) Meow Press. If you have sent something to me in the last year,
please be patient. I am more than a year behind and was ready to give up
the project (I'll post something to poetics that I sent out here locally,
a "eulogy" for Meow Press which I wrote last December). Since meeting with
D.J. Messerli of SUN & MOON, and seeing what he's up to while out in Cali
in January (working in UCSD archives) I have decided NOT to give up Meow
Press, which I thought I would let die once I finished out the 12+ books
which are on the hotplate. Thanks Douglass. But it will be summer before I
pick up the ball and run with it again. The afternoon with him
reinvigorated my desire to get good literature out there and to keep at it
even though I have this giant grey-streak of hair a la pepe lepew...So, if
you have sent something, please be patient. The press is currently
dormant. I'll be moving at the end of April and will instigate a new
workshop at new address (in Buffalo). Sorry for the delays. Finally, a
final project haunts me, my commitment to the Small Press Collective which
was born in 1990 at Reed College and which is about to be ressurected here
under the auspices of Alicia Cohen (who worked on the original with me and
others back then) and others yet to be determined. This is a big project
which will have a minimal investment from me, but it seems that without my
push and insanity might not really get going (if no one is finally
interested, it wont). We are operating under the signs of David
Cohn-Bendit and Angela Davis, let alone Bayard Rustin and MAC LOW--my
eternal hero. More on all this later...

I will post something that I'm posting here locally, where most of the
buffalonian poetic-tasters do their own chat...in the hopes of catching
someone who might be astray, gaining emotional, financial or support in
the form of labor and energy...I'm sorry if it seems too local.

Again, I apologize if my attempt at humor went astray. Please forgive.
Your humble janitor, JK

Subject:      SMALL PRESS COLLECTIVE
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

return of the
SMALL PRESS COLLECTIVE

The first meeting of the newly reconstituted SMALL PRESS
COLLECTIVE will be on Thursday, February 27, 1997, at 5pm
at Spot Cafe, on the corner of Chippewa and Delaware in the
heart of downtown Buffalo, New York.

The purpose of this meeting is organizational, to announce the
intentions of the group, which are still in formation.

Recent events have made it necessary that we meet and discuss
our plans as a "group" or "program." At our last hearing, the
status of the future possibility of renting a shared space was left
undecided. The two main proposals for the use of such space are
basically as follows: 1) a so-called clubhouse, multi-purpose shared
facility; and 2) a shared workshop or production space. These two
positions are not necessarily opposed so much as they are both
wrongly aimed and based on misconceptions of certain key
questions concerning issues of community. Unlimited access to a
shared space is highly unlikely. Therefore, there can be no
"open" space such as Room 412 in Clemens Hall. But limited
access to a space supposedly shared by all [in whatever group is
defined at the beginning] is bound to be a difficult issue, not only
socially, but also in terms of security and liability. It is an issue not
easily resolved without either (1) constructing a hierarchy; and/or
(2) some form of limited access. Assuming that there would be
public events held at the space (perhaps a party or a reading)
perhaps a pre-constructed limit is the best way of resolving
Responsibility in its many forms. A smaller group will handle the
distribution of responsibility/burden and problem of authority
with greater ease than a large group, especially when often the
only thing shared by the members of the group is grad-student
status [we're seeking non-graduate student members and soon
none of us will be graduate students and will have to face up to
our various professionalisms in the face of real desires]. Besides, a
smaller, independent student club is more likely to have success
obtaining a lease than is a nebulous amalgam of disinterested
bystanders whose tacit consent is buoyed only by a rigorous but
impotent argumentativeness. The Poetics Program isn't anything
to us, we don't avow even disavowal of its ways.

We propose that several of us students and interested partisans of
all sorts and types meet together to form an action committee.
The committee's basic activities would be to serve as an
association of self-starters and communalist co-conspirators in
producing written and encoded documents of all kinds, in all
media, forms and venues. We'll invite our fellow compatriots
among department Faculty and those from the so-called "real
world." With the option to buy a letter press and an offset press
for $500 and with the immediate necessity that we make up our
collective minds about seeking space in the coming ArtSPACE
@ Tri-Main complex, the time to act is now.

We propose a publishing collective as essentially collaborative,
with the benefit of being fully optional. Who of us is willing to
work? A general informational-organizational meeting will be
called soon. All interested are welcome! Needed positions/skills
include: writers, editors, printers, critics, poets, artists, designers--
what else?--contact us at Small Press Collective, 438 Clemens
Hall, SUNY-Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 [we will eventually
secure an address "off-campus"]. Or inquire at the following e-
mail addresses (do not post replies to Poetics or Core-L lists,
PLEASE! This will be the last public posting on this matter)

I wouldn't normally post this on the list, but I'm exploring every option.
I need someone to share a (really) large 2 bedroom apartment on the Lower
East Side (Ridge Street, 2 blocks south of Houston) by March 15 or April 1.
It's $1200 a month ($600 each), and you have the option of taking over the
whole apartment on the first of July.  It's a great space at a good price.
If you or anyone you know might be interested, backchannel me,

Thanks

I doubt any of us would know who Ed Dorn is were it not for his poetry.
Yet thus far I have not read one word in this discussion of Dorn's
purported culpability that has anything to say about the poetry.  And
since when are poets necessarily nice people?  With the "right" ideas?  I
agree with Maxine Chernoff!  Let's stop being the Thought Police!  What
would most of the people on this list say if Baudelaire suddenly turned
up, what with his fetishism, his arrogance, etc. etc.?  And what about DH
Lawrence with his strong man cults?  And, let's see, then there's Virginia
Woolf, whose letters to Vanessa are full of the nastiest, anti-Semitic
remarks you can imagine!  And spiteful comments about charladies and so
on.

So:  who shall 'scape whipping?

Intriguing question.  You might want to take a look at Mark Turner's new
_Literary Mind_, Polanyi's _Tacit Knowledge_, and some recent research
showing that facial expressions "cause" emotions.

Attis for Cybele


Which I began to inscribe, from Catullus, memory, having launched
Himself down on the Phrygian Grove across the wine-dark sea, there
To incise himself, flint-cut the lower edges of the sac, scrotum,
His testicles flayed to the ground, blood circulating as she would
Have appealed to gender-morphology, but this, irreversible, could
No longer sustain the space she found herself in, this Jennifer
Produced from the holy mysteries of the Magna Mater. She pranced,
Declaimed loudly, Cybele screaming in the background, always a threat
Holding onto her virgins, but these balls spattered on the holy earth
Were something else again, while Jennifer sits, inscribes another
Surface, servers crashing around her like waves on wine-dark waters.
Again, again, she begins her description of Attis for Cybele, Attis
Having likewise launched, a router on the Internet, turned towards her
Or others, Aegean, Dea magna, dea Cybebe, dea domina Dindymi,
procul a mea tuus sit furor omnis, era, domo:
alios age incitatos, alios age rabidos, get out of here, furious,
Make them crazy, rabid, swallow balls like seeds furrowed, the Net
Splits, opens wide, Alan's driven mad, Jennifer writes in repetition,
All these skinned wounds, all these Fisher Kings.

Comments: To: poetics@UBVM.cc.buffalo.edu

I will by-pass the temptation to send a message that includes all 65
messages that were in this morning's Poetics Digest (many of which
include many additional messages). My eyes blear over.

However. The prospect of anyone even attempting to prevent the Dorns
from participating on this list is disturbing in the extreme and sort
of turns a lot of the questions of the past week on their head, doesn't
it?

But exclusion, of this or any other sort, does seem to be the logical
conclusion of the List's sense of itself as "private." And while
obviously the intention behind that initial impulse was/is good (as in
protecting the list from becoming simply a listserve variant of those
poetry usenet groups), the short & slippery slope from there to here is
always shorter and more slippery than we would imagine.

Maybe it's time to end the List's sense of itself of as "private."

PS,

My apologies to the heirs et al of RP Warren for confusing him with JC
Ransome in an earlier note (thanks to Jerry & Aldon for catching this).
I've tried to figure out how I made that mistake (beyond writing when I
had a bad cold). Three alternatives come to mind: (1) all those
agrarians look alike; (2) since I take Warren more seriously than I do
Ransome, my memory made the "crime" of it seem worse by attaching it to
the "serious" figure; or (3) having actually appeared in Southern
Review myself in my callow youth, I wanted to dissociate my own
publication history from such dishonorable events. I think the "real"
answer is #1 above.

        Does anyone on this list have specific information about the
death, apparently around January 1 of this year, of the Texas
singer-songwriter folk-country musician Townes Van Zandt? A long heroin
problem I know, etc etc, but also some of the best southern songs of the
last 20 odd years. My own sense is that MY MOTHER, THE MOUNTAIN is the
best (and an amazing collection it is) of his sometimes hit-and-miss
studio albums, but he was also a great live musician too--perhaps his best
moment is the song "Early In The Morning" from a late 80s album called
LIVE AND OBSCURE--a truly terrifying incursion into incest, violence and
drunkenness. I'd appreciate either backchannel, or perhaps better, any
information on the list itself.

Subject:      how people behave
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

how people behave is relevant to their poetry their poetry is relevant
they behave is relevant to how they behave they behave is relevant to how
their poetry behaves

        The issue, for instance, of how poets respond both in their work
and in their lives to constructions of male behavior in a male dominated
society is relevant to how they behave is relevant to their poetry to how
they behave is not a matter for simple condemnation is relevant to how
they behave is relevant to the poetry

        When the poet and visual artist John Havelda was here in D.C. two
weekends ago we were all at a bar (is relevant to how they behave) having
a drink and a fight broke out well not a fight really just this big guy
started shouting at a much smaller guy and then hit him and then was
surrounded by people saying "oh you're a big man such a big man for
hitting him" and the big guy was humiliated and left or else you could
have said his behavior is not relevant to poetry

        we could have been in a bar in which it was okay for someone to
hit someone is that relevant to poetry

        are you macho do you hate it when people talk about behavior let's
talk about poetry right the beautiful poetry we're all here for poetry are
you macho do you hate it when people talk about your behavior why do you
hate it when people talk about your behavior

        Ted Berrigan's work exhibits an intense struggle for the issue of
how they behave is relevant to the poetry how he behaved was relevant he
wanted it relevant it was how he behaved to the poetry is relevant he saw
what life was like in Tulsa and went to NYC is NYC really better than
Tulsa really

        In Tulsa in 1921 the relatively prosperous black section of town
was burned down in a riot started by a false accusation by a white woman
that she had been assaulted by a black man the accusation might have gone
no further except a Tulsa paper made it first page news for weeks until
finally there was literally a war the whole black section of Tulsa was
burned and afterwards several black men were prosecuted and one
prosperous black hotel owner ran away to Chicago and escaped
prosecution and the historical memory of the incident was in the hands
of white papers so that UNTIL THE LATE 1980S there was no official record
or acknowledgement in this country of what happened in Tulsa in 1921

        Ted Berrigan and Rod Padgett lived in Tulsa but they didn't know
what happened in Tulsa in 1921

        what facial expression do you have when you write a poem when you
want to beat somebody up your poem has an expression I didn't learn to
fight until I was beaten up a bunch of times as a kid and then I learned
to fight back is it a good thing that I learned to fight back that I
actually know how to "kick your ass" if I need to is that relevant to
behavior in poetry is it relevant to poetry that I may have just indulged
in a bit of macho posturing but nonetheless can still "kick your ass" if I
need to but guess what I'm not going to

        it is easy to be reductive about the issue it is easy to avoid the
issue but if you don't talk about the construction of maleness in
Berrigan's
work in O'Hara's work than you're not seeing part of what mattered to them
as poets and as men and they were both they were poets and they were men I
suppose (what's the definition anyway of "man") and how could being a poet
not be intimately related to being a "man" or just to being

        behavior and poetry and relevance is all relevant to poetry every
time somebody says "that's not relevant" they're just plain fucking wrong

yeah, i'd have to say i'm with mark on this -- it's all relevant, and all a
matter of what you want to emphasize... i don't think relevance =
condemnation either (or for that matter, say, beatification)... so i don't
think that establishing relevance is a holier-than or less-holier-than
activity, or needs to be...

She is beautiful. The room is full, she is beautiful and everyone in the room
is watching her.

She pays me no attention but I don't mind. There is an intense, quiet joy
brought about by her presence and the room is quiet while everyone looks
intently at her and smiles.  It is a rare moment in my life and maybe in her
life too. She rolls her head, almost casually, and her bright eyes bounce from
one object to the next, from one person to the next. She is all smiles and
giggles. She is a peach.

She is cute as a button. She is bald and has no teeth and perhaps others are
wondering, like me, if she may spit up soon on Ange's shirt or something. I
muse quietly in a corner, when she-- Julia-- turns her head quickly at the
sound of her father's voice. It is Joe Torra, who pops in from the kitchen
asking if anyone needs more wine or some other refreshing beverage.

Soon all the guests arrive, and the reader too-- Ed Barrett -- and we begin.
Here is a portion of one poem that he read:

(from THE MUMMY)
"While I'm not defining terms I also won't define poetry since what I recognize
as poetry you may not and what's the point of making a big deal about it? Or if
poetry is life (since terms at either end of an equals sign are identical) then
maybe I should make a big deal about it, the way life does: remember how you
used to get beat up in grammar school if you weren't careful, and even if you
were? The time we hiked across Prospect Park to the Brooklyn Museum to see the
Indian child mummy and on the way back because I asked these other kids what
direction we should take they naturally assumed we needed to get jumped, and
how I was able to keep this jerk away from me by swinging my toy army rifle
around me like a helicopter blade? My friend was wearing an army helmet
(plastic) and I don't remember being asked to check our rifles and helmets at
the museum. I guess you just know if someone is playing seriously and you go
along with it, our mission that day was to see what a dead child looked like."

Ed reads for about a half-hour and is funny and startling and his reading is so
enjoyable that when I ask my girlfriend later if she liked it she tells me she
wishes Ed had read longer than he did.  This gives me pause and I purse my
lips, scratch my head . . . "never wants a second cup at home."  But Ed was
fabulous, read new unpublished work, as well as poems written for the occasion
and also poems for Joe and Molly Torra and their infant daughter Julia.

It's a good Boston turnout at the Torra's: Michael and Isabel Franco,
Christopher Sawyer-Laucanno, Patricia Pruitt, Lisa Amber Phillips, Elliza
McGrand, Bill and Beverly Corbett, Rafael and Lina De Gruttola, Bob D'Attilio,
Ange Mlinko, Steve McNamara, Dan Farrell and Craig Snyder.

We eat calzones and drink wine till it gets late and I leave, singing in my
mind "please come to Boston for the springtime . . . " unable to recall the
singer's name and not knowing to whom it is directed.

he had a heart attack, i think. he left a wife and adolescent daughter
behind.  his wife divorced him a while back but she took care of him and
let him sleep on the couch until the end.  i have a great quote from him
on my frig.  when asked what you have to do to make it as a musician, he
said "first you gotta  get a guitar.  then you gotta blow everything
else off.  you gotta blow off your family.  you gotta blow off your job.
you gotta blow off money.  you gotta blow off security.  you gotta blow
off your ego.  and just play your guitar.  sleep with it.  even if you're
hungry.  i say that to young people . . .  you'd be surprised how many it
scares off."

I'm thankful to Marjorie Perloff and Fiona Templeton
for opening a discussion (hopefully a discussion) of
poetic theater and its relationship to poetics. There
are wonderful American playwrights -- many of them
grouped together as the "Language" playwrights --
who focus on concerns of language and poetry that
is very similar to many of the poets discussed on
this list. These include writers such as Mac Wellman,
Erik Ehn, Len Jenkin, John Steppling, Suzan-Lori Parks,
Fiona Templeton,Naomi Iizuka, and many others.

To help encourage this discussion and the readership
of some of these plays, Sun & Moon offers the following
specials.

Works by Mac Wellman:

ANNIE SALEM: An American Tale
   In this, his second novel, Mac Wellman continues
   his exploration of a low-rent rural America, fes-
   tering in the backwater pollution from the urban
   enviornment. Wellman's astonishing Ohio-like world
   has been tagged by some theatergoers and critics
   as "Macland," a world peopled by cantankerous,
   wistful, confused, and frightened people who have
   lost parts of their bodies, their minds, and their
   souls to the perpetual machine of the American
   dream.
       Regular price $12.95/slightly hurt copies
       sold at a special price of $5.00

BAD PENNY at Bow Bridge
   A short play, winner of the Obie Award, about
   a man who picks up a bad penny (tails up) and
   finds his day his metaphysically altered in
   Central Park.
     Regularly $5.95/20% discount to members of
   the Poetics List

THE PROFESSIONAL FRENCHMAN
   This play by Mac takes place after a Thanksgiving
   dinner in a northern Virgina suburb. Jacques and
   Sam, dangerously imperfect confidence men, close
   in on Blaise Duykick, who smelts stolen silverware
   in the basement bathroom unbeknownst to his wife,
   Femke.
      Regularly $7.95/We offer a 20% discount to
   members of the Poetics List

THE FORTUNTELLER
   Wellman's first long fiction is a "murder mystery."
   A murderer stalks the art community of SoHo in New
   York City. The narrator of this wildly satiric fiction
   seeks to uncover the killer before each of his friends
   (and enemies) becomes a victim.
     Regularly $11.95/slightly hurt copies for $5.00

A SHELF IN WOOP'S CLOTHING
   A poetry of wit and language. Here "polydactyl" meets
   "pumpkinfication" head on in a kaleidoscope of verse.
   Regularly $8.95/Special offer of $4.00

THE LAND BEYOND THE FOREST: Dracula and Swoop
   In these two plays Wellman explores the Dracula
   myth. This time the vampires whoop in up not only
   in their Transylvanian back/badlands in the last
   minutes of 1899, but fly over New York City (in
   Swoop) discussing the awful tastes of the blood
   of critics.
     Regularly $12.95/slightly hurt copies for $5.00

THEATER OF WONDERS: SIX CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN PLAYS
   Plays by Len Jenkin, Jeffrey Jones, Des McAnuff,
   Elizabeth Wray and Wellman.
     Regularly $12.95/slightly hurt copies for $5.00

Works by John Jesurun

EVERYTHING THAT RISES MUST CONVERGE
   will be published by April 1, 1997
   pre-publication offer of a 20% discount to

there's an old caution (by now) about email -- you don't post *anything* to
*anybody* w/o understanding that it may turn up someplace else, with
somebody else, even years later... this is owing to the versatility of the
digital, its permanence, ease of transmission, convertibility...

so it's exactly on the continuum from private to public (or the axis if you
like) that so much of this discussion turns, even setting aside the fact
that this is a list... it's a function of the medium, i mean... and
obviously, our posts *here* are in the hands/minds of -- what is it
currently? -- 450 subscribers?... located on several continents, no less...
with all sorts of systems gaps that permit prying eyes to pry...

i've never really thought of poetics as a "private" space... on the other
hand, i've always assumed that the point of calling it a "private" space
was rhetorical-functional... a way of checking the possibility of a cast of
thousands, and of maintaining some semblance of *individualized* control,
even (and i don't mean this latter in any insidious sense)... charles, our
host, should probably jump in here...

but ron is right -- if each of us hasn't already, perhaps it *is* time that
"we" disabuse our collective self of the notion that what is going on
hereabouts is what we customarily take to be "private correspondence"...
that stuff over there, i mean, in hardcopy land... which isn't always all
that "private," either...

best,

a little behind here
though others may not always agree, this being in the eye, as they say.

as to your questions.
reading gently through the work a tone differs without signpostsings or an echo
of previous words, perhaps movements slight return in mind.  i think there is a
greater (ooh, be 'ware of the generality I'm told) sense of temporality - the
ghost of language allowed to live if you don't curtail its presence by the
quotation marks, these walls of pastureyesation.  but then they can always be
used to distance.  that, the most basic response (keeping closer to 'you'
without, further away with; more alive without, more dead with etc).  but more
basely, the voice predominates rather than the intellect in the absence of
quotes (invented in the seventeenth century, so definitely enlightened) and
this aurality increased.  but always go with how you feel i say.

Townes Van Zandt did gorgeous work, absolutely tough: I heard him once
live and it was very important for me: I read about his death in a local
newspaper here in Boston, the paper said heart attack

to some degree this is happening already, cowriting where it can be
heard, beats those memories of cutting out typography from oldmags &
pasting them letter by letter to make a book which we made ten copies
which we put in 10 envelopes & sent to 10 people.

I think hypertexting our posts is much to be desired spidery way,
because everyone can easily establish submailing lists & mail selected
audiences.

my own approach to using the computer, internet, email, webpages, is to
think of it as completely synchronous with my activities of publishing
xexoxial, Im motivated in a way to approach from a standpoint of
electronic wildernesse, & aggressively carving niches in the  endless
edges & crannies of the net, as well as planting some of my own.  my
approach is anything but passive, but partly too its been incubating
since 84-85 when I made my first hypermedia & understood then that
everything we have now is possible. I just didnt think it would take
this many years to get here. I think there are many workarounds for the
given limitations one feels.  while I have enough of dealing with issues
of gender & politics here at Dreamtime to be interested in participating
in these threads, I like the opened medium, I just wish somedays there
were 3-10,000 other threads to choose from.  more is more.

For those of you in NYC, I believe the radio station KCR (89.9 FM) is
playing Tony Williams all 24 hrs today (Wed)...

Sad news indeed.

thanks for sad indeed news; 51 is young.  i feel lucky to have seen
williams here at the dakota bar and grill a few years ago, where he thanked
folks for coming to the show because "not a lot of people understand this
kind of music; it's loud, it's aggressive, and some people are afraid of
it."  those few words made a deep impression, as did the thrillingly loud,
aggressive music.

I've just spent today in the studio, recording
pieces by Clive Bell for release by Sound and Language
on CD early this summer.

Clive is, alongside Evan Parker and John Butcher and
Peter Brotzmann and Steve Lacy
one of the most extraordinary of solo wind improvisers.

His attitude is, perhaps, worth recounting in relation
to Steve Benson's more recent work as flagged up by Ira
under this thread.

"Having something you need to say is already a closing to
what might be said"

It would be a shame for a writer such as Steve Benson to
be expected to repeat early successes (not that I'm reading
Ira as suggesting such). I too was surprised by the materials with
which Steve was engaging in his Ear Inn '94
and Cambridge '95 performances. Yet the acuity with which
he examines language even as he formulates and utters it
remains for me as finely tuned as ever. The mood is wry.
The bounce material distractions have changed. I don't,
personally, find them any more ironic, although his cadence
is less urgent. They are certainly partially steppings back,
from harshness:

'I could feel myself looking over the hill a long time, after the carriage
had passed, and my story had been told, and ran in the opposite direction,
imagining that the police were after me, and that the cold water tragically
fixed into my confused opinions of my situation until I improperly tore
myself out of the middle of that book, leaving the page numbers intact, and
watched the light from the east strike an awkward pose in the corner,
imagining it would do itself good by offering a body there: a dance that
they do, when they hate to do what is private, and so publicly enunciate
and announce that a game is going to come and be played in this trick ball
park where what they have on the ground is like a red rug, and you have to
wear special glasses to see it as green, and long after we have passed,
there is only just now a relationship between what is sexual and what is a
second individual.' ( from 'The Birds'  -  Language aLive 2)

love and love

Antenym, a xeroxed 8 and a half by 11 stapled magazine, invites submissions
of poetry, fiction, critical and/or philosophical essays, visual art, and
other varieties of work on the theme "Ontological Activism and its
possibilities" to which issue #13 of the magazine will be dedicated.
Submissions may be emailed to <sjcarll@slip.net> or analog-mailed to Steve
Carll at 106 Fair Oaks St. #3, San Francisco, CA 94110-2951, with an SASE
for reply (and return of mss. if desired).  Deadline is June 15, 1997.

On Ontological Activism:

It's often pointed to as the oldest and most fundamental complex of
questions to occur in human consciousness:  "Who am I, and what am I doing
here?"  Questions of this type, along with the resources needed to ask them
and give them adequate reflection, are increasingly proscribed by the
conditions currently structuring much of our daily experience, which
ultimately threatens that human consciousness that makes such questioning
possible and even necessary.

The phrase "ontological activism" announces itself as the public asking of
the questions of being, transforming the individual "who am I?" through
re-integration with the communal--"who are we?" in such a way that the
opening up of personal perspectives may continually transform the communal
as well, by offering examples of investigative strategies.  In this way, the
question becomes, "Do we as human beings wish to continue being, and if so,
how?"

A week or so ago, someone (Maria Damon, I think) posted some information
about a CD magazine that sounded quite interesting.  I don't remember the
details, though I thought an upcoming volume was about Stein.  I managed to
lose the info.  Could someone post it again.  Backchannel is fine.

Tony Williams (very sad) died young, but he started young too--he first
played with Miles Davis at 17!

Townes Van Zandt was indeed quite a songwriter (see "Lungs," "Pancho &
Lefty"), but I shudder to imagine what his politics might have been.

All you people got me to dig out Berrigan's -The Sonnets-.  No cogent
comment, but thanks.

Special to Stroffolino (the only one interested, I bet)--I'm seeing Pavement
tomorrow, if I see Malkmus, I'll get to the bottom of this Ashbery thing.

I havent got a clue. When I am writing I am not in front of a mirror. I
know the expression on my face when I am shaving. But I dont see any
connection with expression of any sort and my poetry. I am too busy
listening.

Sherry --

yesterday I thought I was posting to the Poetics brood, but
inadvertantly (instead) backchanneled my note(s) to you; oh well.

If I start tossing around names like TS Eliot too much, the hipsters
will raise eyebrows anyway, I suppose.  Jorie Graham is a curious
case (in point) too.  I'd say she's been quite influenced by certain
LangPo & such developments -- & I think she's wonderful.  But my
general impression is that to many Poetics types, she's prob. beyond
the pale, since she's so mainstream-published, so well-awarded, etc.

Hmm -- now I'll put my foot in it & post this (though was to
backchannel), since I'm curious for some poss. response re that.

Here then, tacked on, is my 2/26 note, too.

cheers all,
d.i.

p.s.: another tack on the citations / quotations issue.  It's
interesting that in much of Alice Notley's writing, EVERY sentence is
in quotation marks!  (My late friend Lynne Beyer pointed this out to
me, merely wondering what Alice was up to.)  Certainly it's not a
question of borrowed language in the literal, Brennan-asked sense.
Seems (in effect) more like thoughts / words "overheard" -- eh?

Ashbery,  or is it a put-on? and how much text does he get from him ...

(a friend of mine who's doing some work on the utopian body sent me this,
and I thought maybe some on the list would enjoy it too) S.


Here's something to think about on your drive today:

"Fourier predicted that the men and women of the new order would grow
to the height of seven feet and live to the age of 144.   They would
acquire replaceable teeth and develop the capacity to withstand severe
pain.   Their senses would undergo extraordinary refinement, and they
would also become sufficiently amphibious to make full use of the
bottom of the sea.   But the most remarkable physical change in
mankind, which would only take place after sixteen generations of
Harmony, was the development of a new member, an archibras, the
properties of which were described by Fourier in a manuscript censored
by his disciples:

'The Harmonian arm or archibras is a veritable tail, a tail of immense
length and with 144 vertebrae. . . . This member is as redoubtable as
it is industrious.   It is a natural weapon . . . The archibras
terminates with a very small elongated hand, a hand as strong as the
claws of an eagle or a crab. . . . When a man is swimming, the
archibras will help him move as fast as a fish.  It can stretch to the
bottom of the water, carrying fish nets and making them fast.  With its
help a man can reach a branch twelve feet high, climb up and down the
tree, pick fruit at the very top of the tree, and put in in a basket
tied to the archimain.   It serves as a whip and a rein to a man who is
driving a horse-drawn plow. . . .It can be used to tame a wild horse:
the rider can tie up the horse's legs with his archibras.  It is
infinitely useful, and in the playing of musical instruments it doubles
a person's manual faculties since its fingers, although very small, are
extremely stretchable.'"

Surprising that Fourier didn't expound upon its erotic potential, since
that's a subject he rarely leaves out elsewhere!

Bon voyage,

It's Kevin Killian.  I know I have used this space already to announce my
play on March 6 but I wanted to announce a late-breaking development.
After many years away from the stage, Mr. Nick Robinson will be joining my
cast of international stars, essaying the pivotal role of fallen Ubermensch
Christopher Reeve.  Nick Robinson was the man whose work with Poet's
Theater here in the Bay Area first made me want to write for the stage.
Now he returns in "Political Animals."  I feel the puffed up pride of MGM's
Louis B. Mayer when he told the world, in 1945, to promote "Adventure"
(Victor Fleming), --

"Gable's Back--and Garson's Got Him!"

more on tulsa incident: there is a novel by Susan Straight called The
Gettin' Place, published by Hyperion last year, that tells the story of a
family since moved to a California town much like Riverside (calla Rio
Seco), but which began in Tulsa during those riots. Very fine book, as
Straight, a white woman from Swiss stock who was raised and now
lives in pretty much a black Riverside community, is an excellent writer. I
interviewed her for Publishers Weekly a few years ago and she would
blanch at my foregrounding her racial background and the environs she
grew up in, but her perspective on the black, vietnamese, hispanic
communities she knows so well are terrific: it is the perspective of
someone who has seemlessly been assimilated.



about other atrocities (how people behave): look for a memoir by the
poet Peter Balakian, coming in may, about his eventual understanding of
the Armenian genocide of 1915, engineered by the  turks. His discovery
of poetry is  entwined with the historical consciousness of what
happend to his "people," and is effectively, beaautifully told. And for
anyone who grew up in a middle-class household in the 60s in new york
or new jersey, the wealth of perfectly remembered cultural references
of the time is entertainiang enough; but the book is heavy, heavy; I think
bound to be a small classic of the memoir genre, much like Nabokov's
speak memory, it is about a family's disposesssion and exile and
structured with the integrity of a long poem.
Basic Books, oddly enough, is the publisher. Balakian, i believe, teaches
at Colgage in upstate new york.

I just started reading a book called *Death in a Promised Land* about the
1921 Tulsa Riots, veri interesting and very horrifying.  As the author
describes the rise of Tulsa's black middle class the sense of the
inevitability of serious white backlash grows in a creepy, uncomfortable
way and the photographs in the book enhance that - one picture, of several
white men throwing torches into the second story of a black man's very
large house which has started to smoke all over, literally made me feel
ill.  Tulsa is actually quite an amazing 20th century cultural space -
lots of literary figures in the area as well as jazz musicians (a prime
secondary site for band's like Basie's in the 20's).  Then there's the
fact that the Native Americans who were forced there around the turn of
the century ended up sitting on a lot of oil land.  Somehow laws were
instituted which made the city hier to that land if the particular native
American owners died - unsurprisingly, they started dropping like flies.
More recently there's Larry Clark's (he dircted the movie *Kids*) book of
photographs *Tulsa* (1971?) - photos of white tulsa teengaers shotting
amphetamine, having sex, wielding guns, etc.

Hey, in this week's VILLAGE VOICE, there is an article about filmmaker Cheryl
Dunye. She and I used to be roommates in Phila. She used to cut my hair and
helped me get one job. It was VERY good to see that she's doing well for
herself (her fame of course the result of negative publicity--being
blacklisted by Jesse Helm for her black lesbian "agenda" a la Todd Hayne's
fame being result of offending Dick Carpenter).
I bring this up for those of you who may remember my SCHMIDT-DEAN GALLERY
reading series of the early 1990's when I had her films shown with ABBY
CHILD'S and Bob Perelman and Francie Shaw sat in the front row of the
audience, asking pointed comments, etc. (Oh, gossip, gossip).
Would anybody here know how to get in touch with Ms. Dunye?
I have not seen her in years. Has anybody seen this new film?
All for now, Chris Stroffolino

Yes, it IS a silly thread, but it's like TV, it gets our mind off things.
Stultifyingly dull "Grammys" last night, I couldn't watch more than a half
hour or so.

I, too, have been told I stick out my tongue when writing (and teaching)
ala Michael Jordan. Would like to thing that's because I'm tasting the
words. Can anyone confirm for me that there's a college basketball player
at the moment (Minnesota?) who's been called "the Jewish Jordan"?

On the Osage of Oklahoma and white folks orgasm for oil see Linda
Hogan's 1990 novel _Mean Spirit_. The usual raw materials for 20th
century amerrycan poetico-ethics.

Relatedly, to Tulsa and such conflagrations that is, see Michael
D'Orso's book of last year _Like Judgement Day: The Ruin and Redemption
of A Town Called Rosewood_. This as a corrective to the hollywoodization
of the story in the new John Singleton and warner bros movie _Rosewood_.
D'Orso's book is more the rendering of how the story of the racist
destruction of the town has been variously remembered, narrated and
memorialized.

I'll confess I find some of Jorie Grahm's work quite bracing tho lately it's
become rather attentuated and verging on the pompous. Her appropriation of
LangPo and Olsonite techniques begins with "End of Beauty," tho she applies
these to rather different ends.

Notley's quotation marks are fascinating. They function more as metrical
units than anything else. And in _Alette_ they act as analogues for the
stroboscopic flashings of the subway itself.

Sherry --

yesterday I thought I was posting to the Poetics brood, but
inadvertantly (instead) backchanneled my note(s) to you; oh well.

If I start tossing around names like TS Eliot too much, the hipsters
will raise eyebrows anyway, I suppose.  Jorie Graham is a curious
case (in point) too.  I'd say she's been quite influenced by certain
LangPo & such developments -- & I think she's wonderful.  But my
general impression is that to many Poetics types, she's prob. beyond
the pale, since she's so mainstream-published, so well-awarded, etc.

Hmm -- now I'll put my foot in it & post this (though was to
backchannel), since I'm curious for some poss. response re that.

Here then, tacked on, is my 2/26 note, too.

cheers all,
d.i.

p.s.: another tack on the citations / quotations issue.  It's
interesting that in much of Alice Notley's writing, EVERY sentence is
in quotation marks!  (My late friend Lynne Beyer pointed this out to
me, merely wondering what Alice was up to.)  Certainly it's not a
question of borrowed language in the literal, Brennan-asked sense.
Seems (in effect) more like thoughts / words "overheard" -- eh?

Joe,
you shoulda watched the fabulous "Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" on AMC. A
seminal work from my TV matinee childhood. Best line: "There's a certain
inexorable chronology to these events." I think I'll "sample" that one. The
way it uses very grainy stock footage of glaciers, US Airforce planes, etc.
charmingly and naively anticipates use of same scratched, artificially aged
postmod stuff in music vids, etc. Ray Harryhausen's monsters are a thousand
times more poetic than Spielberg's. Or maybe I'm just being nostalgic.

Thanks, I think, Don Cheney, for liking the questions I ask. This
particular question about the facial expression one assumes while writing
is pretty silly, yes. Poe's story "The Purloined Letter" has a nice passage
about studying facial expressions to understand what decisions people will
make. I remember (and I know that remembering doesn't prove the truth value
of one's statements about the past -- however, I've slowly been coming to
the conclusion that epistemology is for suckas) that Wittgenstein made many
gnomic remarks about a hypothetical naive observer imitating the facial
expressions of people performing tasks such as thinking and writing,
imagining that by imitating those expressions, this observer would then
able to perform those tasks. (Of these tasks, I'm pretty sure Wittgenstein
says that to an observer, it must seem that a 'queer process' is taking
place.) In the twin interests of coincidence and disclosure, Don, I've
noticed that I sometimes make the cat face when I write.

Re: Tulsa & Ron Padgett - In case no one else mentioned this, Ron P. has an
essay, "Among the Blacks", which is an autobiographical exploration of his
relationships to blacks as he was growing up in Tulsa. (The essay is paired
with his translation of Raymond Roussel's work of the same title.) There is
no mention of the 1921 conflagration. Why not might be a question, or might
have been a provocative exploration - in terms of pairing the two essays -
 in that the Tulsa event took place while Roussel was still actively
producing 'his' African works.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I have been out of e-mail range for about a week and am trying to read
through the accumulated Poetics messages. But I hope it is now apparent to
one and all that the policy at Poetics is to welcome anyone interested in
joining the list and (virtually) *never* remove anyone from the list (except
in the extremely rare sort of cases outlined by Eliza McGrand, Alan
Sondheim, and Joe Amato, which have not been a problem for this list). I
find it odd that I should even have to write such a sentence in this
context, but I am reluctant to torque it in a way that might be
misunderstood -- although anything you say can and will be misunderstood
(isn't that Amberian's 99th Law of Community?).
        I think one reason Joel felt his sarcasm would be understood as
ironic is that the possibility that he would delete folks from the list in
the way he described is so far-fetched to him, as it is to me, as to be
patently absurd. But of course, the lesson is (if we need one): it is *not*
too far fetched to be believed and that reasonable, sympathetic people can
imagine that we could actually conduct this list in such an abhorrent
fashion. I know the problem from the inside too: that odd feeling I have
more than I'd like of not knowing if something is a joke or not, or for that
matter the similar feeling that the people I have grown to trust could
somehow not be who I thought they were. Somehow this e-space foments these
unmoorings, since, as many have noted, one doesn't see that the person
making the "appalling" remark can hardly keep from laughing; and where the
frames, established in a poem or essay to indicate a (yes, indeed,
*possibly*) nonauthorial point of view, may not be noted even if they are
marked. So we land again on the problem of the ironic or indeed the
dramatic, if I understood Fiona Templeton's recent point about shifting tones.
         (I can confirm, by the way, that Herr A. Hitler is not subscribed
to this list despite active efforts to reach him in his multi-e-media-
equipped bunker, with the expectation that participating in the list might
encourage him to reconsider his views on "degenerate" art, which I, for one,
have always found problematic. However we do hope to have both Evita and
Larry Flynt on board soon.) [Joke emoticon removed for further genetic study.]

I want also to register my appreciation to Jerry Rothenberg for his remarks
on the responsibility we all have in posting to this or any list. I have
always felt that the spontaneity of response that seems the very heart of
the list at its best also has the darker side of circulating ideas that have
not been well considered (or considered also by another reader -- editor or
friend). Given this is the case, though, one has to read this genre of
communication for what it is and always with some skepticism. The problem is
when we read what is more like a spontaneous comment made in the heat of
exchange as if it were revised or edited essay. That is, the reader bears
some responsiblility for keeping in the mind the context of the writing. I
realize I may be belaboring the obvious here, but it is because I am
interested in what are the specific characteristics of exchanges on email
lists, which tend toward the improvisational rather than the compositional.

As to the (recurring) discussion of the politics of the poets, I recommend
Jerome McGann's "Canonade" in New Literary History (25;3, Summer 1994),
which takes up the problem from a somewhat different point of view, and one
which I suspect would bring into agreement some of those lately disagreeing.
McGann's focus is on the attempts on both sides of the academic "canon wars"
to contruct a canon of, let's say, saintly poets. McGann's is a critique of
the ever-resurgent idea (on both left and right) that art should be
uplifting. Indeed, McGann won't let us forget that range of poetry that
dwells, without disavowing -- that is, dwells in ways that make readers
anxious -- on the foulest thoughts and darkest visions of a culture. He
quotes Blake's idea that "The greatest Poetry is immoral" but also Byron's

                He left a [Poet's] name to other times,
                Linked with one virtue, and a thousand crimes

[to use the substitution for "Corsair" that McGann, in effect, suggests].

McGann goes on to say about Eliot's most notorious poem: "Yet what a
remarkable poem--indeed, how remarkable exactly because it has sunk into its
own disgusting imagination!... Serpentine, garage-door, phlegm: all have,
like the beast Ahab, their humanities. Their eyes are watching God, even
when they watch from that cesspool titled `Sweeney Among the Nightengales.'"


********
A Short Note on the Privacy of This List

The Poetics List does have a wide open front door: it's called the
Electronic Poetry Center. We make every effort to have the EPC listed as a
link at poetry and art sites and guidebooks and lists. Through the EPC it is
relatively easy to find out about the list -- if interested. Also the 473
list subscribers, and hundreds of nonsubscribers who are familiar with the
list, recommend the list to interested people. As I have written in previous
posts, the issue of inclusion/exclusion in this medium is complex. For many
reasons, a number of subscribers on this list would not be willing, or in
many cases able, to participate if the list volume increased substantially
from what it is now or if the list took on the character of a news group of
strangers meeting for the first time. We have here a semblance of knowing
one another, and beyond that many of us do know one another, or end up
meeting one another at one time or other. The aim is to maintain an open
space for exchange among people with specific and related, if necessarily
undefined and polydictory, poetic commitments. That is, to have a list such
that the participants generally (want to) read (most or all of) the posts
and have some sense of the history of what has transpired here. This
requires a long-term commited relationship, like they (used to?) say (which
is not to say that other kinds of e-relations might not have other values).
        As I've put it when the list had half the current number of
subscribers: "The paradox is that in an attempt to be open and nonexcluding
one can end up excluding those who are unable to handle the volume: people
are drowned out rather than kept out -- until Dreamworks Interactive, Inc.,
guides us and we asphyxiate."

And speaking of being swamped, this also has to do with the limited capacity
of those of us dealing with administering the list to handle any greater
volume. For example, Joel's daily work on list maintenance, not a
particularly fun job, though somewhat interesting at times. Thanks again,
Joel. (As to Loss Glazier's Herculean labors on the EPC: enough cannot be said.)

Wd be a silly question I think to those cerebral poets who hope their
work has no connection to the body, but (notwithstanding Poe and
Wittgenstein's tangential points)this is not consistent with research.

Lisa Jarnot mentions:

"...something that Robert Duncan says about how you can't reject ...Hitler
as the enemy because that potentiality exists in everybody."

I certainly hope Robert Duncan never wrote anything as foolish as that.

It would have been more useful to leave Dorn on the list than to delete him
without mention and without the knowledge of those whom the list comprises.

It would have been interesting to see what his contributions were. Given
what they might have been (speculative tho that is) it would have been
interesting to see how this group of people reacted. It is interesting in
utopian structures (and a conversation is one) to see how people react to
whatever develops. In fact, it's more than interesting, it's crucial. I'm
sure Joel acted in good faith (and in irrepressible revulsion too), but I
would have preferred Dorn here than locked out.

I think Ed Dorn might be looking for a place.

It's incredible to watch the waves of convention wash across this list. The
sense of potential gaffe at resisting vile remarks, the unwillingness to
treat a person as a person if that person is a poet, and the love love love
of rhetoric, as in Dorn's "how *I* take a man" -- that *I* that somehow
takes it oh so differently.

Ok, ok. If he talks nice, he can come around me. I'd hate to diss someone
just for jew-baiting, just for AIDS-bashing. That kind of "Hollywood black
and white" is so much less interesting than for example finding some kind
of "interpretive space" for the "discourse" and then having a "conference"
about it? After all, who can't identify with giving Steve Abbott the screw?
None of us is perfect, right?

Start over.

Comments: cc: davidi@wizard.net

Our worthy listmeister's remarks -- beyond being welcome on several
planes -- also served to bring (back) to mind a question re: the surprising
Emily Dickinson epistolary excerpt that happened to surface -- last
week? -- amid the helter-skelter of the other E.D.'s contretemps.

I can't now locate the original post (from, I believe, Aldon Nielsen) -- but
the brief quotation was (as you'll recall) from a (probably chatty) letter
of Emily's, wherein an apparently egregious, exceedingly xenophobic
remark was tossed out in a maybe parenthetical (& poss. lighthearted?,
perhaps self-ironical? &/or poss. even -- can this be? -- bullseye sarcastic
of others who were wont to offer such remarks dead-*serious*?) manner.

Charles B. notes --

<< . . . I think one reason Joel felt his sarcasm would be understood as
ironic is that the possibility that he would delete folks from the list in the
way he described is so far-fetched to him, as it is to me, as to be patently
absurd. But of course, the lesson is (if we need one): it is *not* too far
fetched to be believed and that reasonable, sympathetic people can
imagine that we could actually conduct this list in such an abhorrent
fashion. I know the problem from the inside too: that odd feeling I have
more than I'd like of not knowing if something is a joke or not, or for that
matter the similar feeling that the people I have grown to trust could
somehow not be who I thought they were.  . . .>>

Question: how far-fetched is it (would it be) to read Emily's utterance in
a context akin to the above?  Since I know precious little anent ED's RW
life & its social surround, I ask this out of frank ignorance.

In "Man's Fulfillment in Order and Strife" Duncan writes:

himself, against the truth of things."

I kind of thought it made sense in the context of the Dorn discussion since
there has been talk of counteracting ignorance with physical violence.

there's not much foolishness in Duncan.

sounds about right.  I heard her give a reading in DC last year --
only caught the final part (due to office work situation), but much
enjoyed her intelligent (I felt) performance & writing.  Come to
think of it, also saw her read in NYC circa '90, in a somewhat odd
(but likeable enough) program with a couple of poets (Bob Creeley
being one of 'em) & a couple of painters, up at the Jewish Y (as I
believe it's nicnamed).

Anyhow, perhaps I've simply developed a liking for what Jorie Graham
is up to.  True, she takes those methods & modes in her own direction.

Here's a poem by Gary Geddes, a Canadian poet who read at the Louisville
conference -- it does a better job of saying what I want to say about
all this than I could do on my own.  (Don't know what Geddes thinks
about Dorn, but I take his point here to be a general one).

Robert Archambeau



The Last Canto

I seldom budge
from Rapallo.
Venice is no Byzantium
these final days.
Stench from the canals
worse than the cattle ship
I sailed to Europe on.

Mr Nixon was half right:
poetry did not pay,
but there was a future in it.
The age demanded
a scapegoat and a saint.
Being American
I applied for both jobs.

The world has been my whale-road,
wanderer and seafarer
among the lost manuscripts,
charting connections
few had ever dreamed of.
I've gone about my business
like a pack rat.
You have to do that,
have on hand ten times
what you can ever hope to use.
Tennyson was right
about being part of all he met,
but he hadn't met enough.

As the range broadened
my speech became barbarous,
that of a man who's lost contact
with the words of his fellows,
though he knows their hearts'
most intimate desires.

I once advised trashing the metronome
and composing with the music
of the speaking voice.
Now I say:
Exercise the mind
and school the heart;
voice will rejoice
in its tender chains
like a bridegroom.

While my former countrymen
have given up on ideas,
except in things,
whatever that means,
and play with themselves
like clergymen,
less out of need than habit,
I dream
of ideas in action
and of forma, even the canetto,
where the dance of the ear
and intellect
draw dormant filings
into the pattern of a rose.

I wrote in an article
in T.P.'s Weekly in 1913:
The artist is always beginning.
Any work of art
which is not a beginning,
an invention, a discovery,
is of little worth.

I still hold that view
though at times, I admit,
I counted the cost.

I have spoken too much of usura,
or not enough.
Even the air we breathe
is rented for a price.

Forget my dicta:
direct treatment of the thing
and all that rot.
The thing, so-called,
has yet to be revealed.
I have found poems
to be wiser abd more honest
than poets.

Remember the ideogram
from the Chinese,
the one representing truth
which shows a man
standing beside his word.
Nothing more.
The merchant's wife
dying alone
in her unkempt garden
by the river
praises
my irregular feet,
though she draws the line
at Social Credit.

Forget me too:
listen to the poems.

You see, I'm prescriptive
to the end, a weakness
acquired in Hailey, Idaho
and never shaken.

Thanks, Lisa.

I don't know why this would be a surprise. This is the core of
Duncan's argument with Denise Levertov (or Leveton as the NY Times has
it in Mitchell Goodman's obit) and the foundation of his poetics.
