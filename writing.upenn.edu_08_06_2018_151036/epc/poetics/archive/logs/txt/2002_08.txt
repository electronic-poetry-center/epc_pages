It seems there's always room in Jacket's overstuffed pockets for a few more
literary morsels.

Fresh Item: Ern Malley's recently discovered Last Will and Testament
(readers will note a suspicious likeness in some of the text to the last
delirious ramble of morphine-soaked Arthur Rimbaud, Marseilles, 1891)

Fresh Item: Free Grass magazine: a link to the electronic edition of the
only extant number of Free Grass magazine, made up of HTML text and linked
photographic images of the original printed pages. Free Grass, a five page
mimeographed magazine, splashed into the pond of little 'underground'
magazines in Australia in 1968. The editorial standards were loose, and
there was a strong counter-cultural flavour to the thing. Strangest of all,
it lived up to its title: it was literally free. But Free Grass had a secret...

John Tranter's poetry has "a cool elegance and ... a macabre whimsy which
reminded me irresistibly of the best moments in Twin Peaks" (Andrew Riemer,

I dislike the idea of advertising. There _is_ a list I keep for those who
just want my work; it's in place. The work depends on its dissemination.

Personally, I'm sick of hearing from Jesse Glass and Tranter's advertising
- should that stop them?

Mez on occasion posts to 8-10 lists; I get that many duplicates from her.
Not that often, but enough to take notice of. Should we get rid of her?

I don't send out "samples" of my work. If enough people want me to leave
this list, I will. But I'm not into advertising, except maybe once/twice a
year to try and sell my cdroms in order to survive.

Personally I'd rather see MORE poetry on this list than advertising, and a
hell of a lot LESS talk about langpo when it comes to poetics. Or maybe we
should start say an exciting list dealing with pop art as the lastest
thing?

There are people on a lost of lists I automatically delete, or almost
always - including NN, who I like, but get 5-10 messages a day from
her/them. Perhaps she should be excluded from the lists she was on? She
was already kicked off some - and at the same time voted one of the most
important women on the Internet.

But since no one here practically reads or understands any of this, why
bother reading someone who has a following a hell of a lot greater than
any of us? And probably writes better too.

Let's clean this list - turn it into Kristeva's clean and proper body. The
langpo boys and poets can take over. Dead meat. Dead writing. Long live
it. Safe academic stuff. Fuck it all that we have some sexual/"ultra-
violent" work here. Better to write abstract.

Above all keep poetry clean and useless. Talk among ourselves. Sanitize.

Alan

I think Maria's onto something when she raises _fear_ as a response to alan
sondheim's writing... fear of what,  I'm not sure; but I have a big nose and
I smell fear quite easily

she mentions bodily fluids and maybe that's it - like the man in the kubrick
film worried about the enemy and the danger to his precious bodily fluids

we live in a fearful world

alan's a good antidote to that

posting his work to a separate list would be a different *kind of post

because the work exists considerably in its context, to change the mode of
its posting would be to change the work - obviously if i delete the
webartery copy of something because I already got it on wryting (taking the
chance he hasn't sent different versions and one day he may and I'll
probably miss it) then i am largely deleting the same thing; yes; but what I
mean is that the work exists as a form of intervention... or so it seems to
me

put it in a channel and you change it; what was ground water accumulating to
a river becomes guttered

for myself i distinguish between jesse glass, with whom i never seem to
agree, and john tranter who seems to me sane and reasonable; but i take
alan's point; and i wld not consider channeling either because tho NO
LOONIES is a sound rule, we'll never agree who's on the list of loonies

i'm not sure what langpo is now. i'm not sure if i ever write it. how do you
know? was that a dirty thought i had just then? or a clean thought?

sure, clear out dead writing, if you can identify it. my garden is full of
weeds and they're flowering spectacularly just now. how do you identify it?

Lawrence, Your garden is a paradise for snails! moans my garden-tidying
neighbour,who may dream of a final snailsolution. Well, that's ok then, I
have to say; they'll want to stay in paradise, won't they? If I change
anything they might go into your garden.

Moderation in all swings and roundabouts. i think alan's doing fine
regulating himself

keep em rolling, alan. i don't tell you enough how often your writing is
spot on.

The late Alaric Sumner, whose papers I am... er... executing, had a piece
published by them, a paper he gave at University of Vechta in the late 90s

I have not yet looked into the details of the process; but I have had hell's
own job getting any response at all from them. Letters and emails are just
ignored. I *assume that they must generally be responsive in order to stay
in business and I *have *assumed therefore that their reluctance to respond
to me is that I want to receive information without offering the prospect of
making them money

i'll have a look to see if there is anything i havent yet picked up wch
might be relevant to your query, but it'll be a week or 2 before i can
answer

i find it hard to imagine AS coughing up money in such circumstances;he was
generous, but not like that!

much as i appreciate attempts at mediation, part of the fun of sondheim on
poetix is the randomness and juxtaposition, the impurity of the list as it
conveys ads, self-promotions, announcements, jokes, queries, poems,
discussion, etc.  i'd hate to see one of its prize features eliminated...i
have several friends who keep a sondheim file out of the poetics postings...

As the gardening genius Alan Titchmarsh says, "weeds are flowers where you don't
want them".

Snails often mean that that georgeous bird the thush is in near attendance. It's
good to see a thrush perched on a stone cracking open a snail for food.

Maria,

It may be quite fascinating, but it's hardly a new thing in the history of
literature for a writer to provoke "outbursts" of critical opposition.  Why
does anybody review anything negatively?  What are they afraid of?  One
might always psychoanalyze.  One might always say, as Alan does in
"contamination," "your hatred extends to anything you do not comprehend."

The good news for Alan Sondheim is that many of the greatest poets/artists
have met with extreme critical adversity in their lifetimes. Remember how
Whitman was slammed in the Atlantic?
http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/classrev/whitman.htm  Of course, great
imposters have also met with adversity, and rightly so.

I'm not sure why any of this has to end up with suggestions that Alan take
his work elsewhere.  I've defended his right to post in the past, and
recently, and here again; Alan, post away.  Stick with your game plan.

Cheers,
-Aaron

This thread reminds me of an incident which happen on my way home from the
Avant Garde Festival in Columbus OH this last weekend.  On the drive home my
friend & I passed thru the town of Wauseka IN.  As we were entering town the
first thing you see is a giant full sized billboard with 3 ft high letters
which said "Any public displays of affection are illegal.  You will be
arrested."

As a very irregular contributor to the list, I thought I'd chip in with a
few comments.

Like others on the list I too keep Alan's poems in a special folder (The
Alan Sondheim Folder), which I like to read while listening to Stockahausen
CD's -- somehow the two make sense together..I'm especially impressed with
the sexual content as not many male writers are bold enough to do this, and
do it well.

I don't get the code at all, as I really don't have that much interest in
it.. and, yes, the delete key is close at hand when they come though.. If
anyone would like to take the time to explain them (or code) to me, I'm a
very open learner!

As for the flaming and attacks, well, I enjoy those too. I think they are
unavoidable when a list that deals with any art for artist (we love poetry,
right? that's why were here).. At least the flamers have some passion . When
my work get attacked in such a way (as it was just last week ), I find that
in the end I've learned something.. even if it is how to defend my work!

I do wish I had more time to post, but alas, with an office job in Tokyo,
writing isn't getting enough attention as is.

Here are some appreciations and republications (in colour!) of Alan
Sondheim's writings online:

http://www.softopia.demon.co.uk/2.2/digital_diary_02.07.18.html


His reactions, and those of others, to the attacks of 9/11 appear at:
http://www.softopia.demon.co.uk/2.2/digital_diary_18sept01.html


Alan's website appears with others I like at :
http://www.softopia.demon.co.uk/2.2/websites_i_like.html

...to me his writings are not things to be attacked but changes to be
pondered in the collective mind, or human circumstance... what he
does is surely conditioned by more of reality than most of us can
respond to so directly...?

I think Kari is touching on a point of discomfort (for me) in this
discussion--and that is the rise of the anti-body subtext.  For some
of us, subverting standard notions of body
perceptions/categorizations is important in the politics of our work.
The avant-poetryland's repeated dismissing of body/sex/gender as a
topic of poetry is enraging--as is being lumped in the same category
as straight guys talking dirty.  It ain't the same ballgame.

Igor Satanovsky reporting in the wake of  =93American Avant-Garde: The Secon=
d Wave=94  conference at Ohio State University, Columbus OH: what a great ev=
ent! About 50 writers & multimedia  artists involved in Concrete, Sound & Vi=
sual Poetries,  Intertimedia &  other experimental unclassifiables  came tog=
ether for a historic 2 days symposium & exhibition  organized by the Ohio Av=
ant-luminary John M. Bennett.=20

These are notes on the presentations that I got to see on Saturday, July 27t=
h. Since the events took place simulteniously in 2 rooms (plus another room=20=
presenting multimedia & taped presentations), I got to see only 1/3 of what=20=
was going on.

ROOM 327 - RARE BOOKS & MANUSCRIPTS LIBRARY

9:00 - Robert H. Jackson, William S. Burroughs' Influence on Recent Writing
One of Burroughs' major collectors. He concentrated on  Burroughs' formal in=
novations, and influence his writing had on contemporary American fiction: W=
illiam Gibson, David Foster Wallace; and Latin American literature - Cortaza=
r and Gabriel Garcia Marquez; themes of paranoia in contemporary writing. Ho=
wever, i found his overall Burroughs spin to be slightly off. I doubt Burrou=
ghs was a great humanist. His major strengh lied in his ability to analyze a=
ddiction and its relation to social structures with a clear-eyed  anthropolo=
gical precision of a junky surgeon, scary and comic at once. There is more t=
o be said about that.


9:30 =96 William James Austin, Against Formalism: Experiments with Internali=
ty
Dr. Bill's poetic tribute to Avant-Garde deconstructed major paradoxes of it=
s eternaly vanishing identity, and its relation to form and desire. Great st=
uff. I am sure it will be published by somebody soon.

11:30 - Michael Basinski, Aural Concrete
Michael Basinski a truly amazing performance. First, he read a manifesto cal=
ling on visual poets to find a way to perform their work, and then demonstra=
ted possibilities of such approach by vocalizing all possible associations c=
onnected with his visual poems. If not for a strictly enforced half-hour cap=
 on all presentation, I had a feeling he could go on and on, smoothly mining=
 all visual, semantic and sound associations from the dense texture of his q=
uite funny visuals, made with/from the most "democratic" materials like regu=
lar markers and cereal boxes.

1:00 - Geoffrey Gatza, Tantalum: The Congo War Interpreted Through Consumer=20=
Acuity
Another outstanding act. It was my pleasure to meet  Geoffrey, whose very po=
litical work is fresh and demonstrates a sense of purpose, putting elements=20=
of corpo-speak, langpo and vispo aesthetics to excellent use. Finally, I tho=
ught, our generation is making a statement and sets itself apart.=20

3:00 - John M. Bennett, Reading
was very entertaining. He played serious attention to sound and read well, c=
ombining in his writing elements of mandane surrealism & Joycean infra-verba=
l inventiveness. In the end, we heard collaborative pieces for 4 voices with=
 Kathy Ernst, Scott Holmes & Michael Peters. I sure regret that I could not=20=
attend ACA residence at the New Smyrna beach last summer, led by the master=20=
resident Richard Kostelanetz.=20
John M. Bennett, Kathy Ernst, Scott Holmes, Michael Peters, Bob Grumman and=20=
others went there and collaborated on several interesting projects.=20


Events in ROOM 122

10:00 - Carlos M. Luis, Reading=20
This was my time slot, but by the time I made it downstairs from Mr.Austin=
=92s presentation, Carlos Luise began, and I was moved  to 10:30. Carlos Lui=
se is a Cuban-American  artist/ poet and art critic from Miami. His early wr=
iting /art was firmly rooted in a surrealist tradition, but eventually he mo=
ved away from it to create some unclassifiable art/vispo/poetry all his own,=
 exuding  human warmth that is so enduring in Latin  avant-garde. His biling=
ual reading reminded me about my 4 years in South Florida and its booming La=
tin cultures=92 scene.

10:30 - Igor Satanovsky, The Cutting Edge: Re-Engaging the Canon (slide proj=
.)
Russian Avant-Garde is in the house! Advantages: loud and armed with a megap=
hone. Drawbacks: running our of time.  Objectives: to recut the whole Wester=
n Canon and make it avant-garde. First results: are in the book: american po=
etry (free and how). =91nough said.

11:00 - Jesse Glass, Reading (CD boombox)
Jesse has spent the last 10 years in Japan, where he teaches English in Meik=
ai University outside Tokio, and blended in to such a degree that he looks r=
emarkably Japanese in his manners and body language. I loved his sound piece=
s, which have a lot to do with a Japanese white noise scene, and his writing=
 is all over the map, balancing on the paradoxes of his East/West identity.=20=
He also recently co-edited Tokio Literary Anthology.

1:30 - Michael Peters, Wholesale Form: An Attack on the Corporate Form
            with Text and Sound (powerpoint & boombox)
Michael Peters, a manic tall bald guy with long hands and craziest ready-to-=
pop blueyes I have ever seen, could be playing mad rock-n-roll Mayakovsky on=
 off off Broadway. I already met him before thru Richard Kostelanetz (Richar=
d got sick at the last moment  and could not attend the conference). Michael=
=92s  opening sound piece was very effective. He used a powerpoint  projecti=
on, guitar pedals and a mic to create a sonic assault  and atmosphere of ser=
ious nervous restlessness and paranoia, moving on to dissect means of corpor=
ate invasive mental domination. Here was another  intelligent  energetic int=
ermedia presentation, that, like Geoffrey Gatza=92s, had its objectives in s=
ight, and went after them ferociously.=20

3:00 -  Michael Magazinnik, Soundvisual Poetry in Performance (slide proj.)
Mike gave his best performance yet, combining reading with overhead projecti=
on of visuals in Russian and English. The highlights included his consonant=20=
poetry. I especially liked a  piece that incorporated a toy musical box. Wit=
h his hands raised and a face split in two by the edge of a projector=92s li=
ght, he created an eerie effect of some shamanistic ritual going on.=20

3:30 - Bob Grumman, Doing Long Division in Color (overhead proj.)
Here goes another Floridian, who is one of a kind. Bob is known best as a cr=
itic for his review column in Small Press Review, but he is also a visual an=
d math poet. I have seen some math poetry before, but nothing like Bob=92s w=
ork. He specializes in Mathemaku (his hybrid of haiku and math poetry), whic=
h he creates by constructing weird division formulas, where instead of numbe=
rs we find entities like =93spring=94, =93woods=94 and =93memory.=94 What I=20=
most admire about Bob is his ability to pick up the most cliched romantic no=
tions and turn them into poetry. Recently, Bob began adding color to his wor=
k, and it brought the whole new dimention to it. For example, a blue square=20=
represents sky in his Long Divisions, which involve music notations from Bee=
thoven. The next logical step for him would be to move into animating his wo=
rk and the web is a perfect media for that.

Michael Peters, mIEKAL aND, Brandon Barr, David Baratier, Joel Lipman, Jessy=
 Glass, Geffrey Gatza, Irving Weiss, Jim Leftwich, Scott  McLeod, and everyb=
ody else =96 it was pleasure meeting & chatting with you! Once again, specia=
l thanks to Mr. Bennett for organizing this event; to the Sackners for doing=
 what they do, and to everybody else who was there - for making it such a bl=
ast! Those of you who got to attend other presentations at the conference, p=
lease fill in the blanks!

Why are you perpetuating this LIE about Igor Satanovsky being at the Ohio
thing, John!  It's
outrageous!  Otherwise, as one of the people you boosted, I had trouble
finding anything wrong with it.  Seriously, you caught the flavor of it very
well.  I'm going to do a piece on it, too, so will probably quote you.  I
noticed a few typos, which I've
noted below, but it read well.

Thanks for the good words!  Bob

Dodie,

My term "ultra-pornographic" didn't refer to body/sex/gender subject matter,
but to literal pornographic episodes in Sondheim's work. Sex in front of
cameras, 'net porn, etc, captured in the linguistic monochrome one comes to
associate with Alan's work.  There's a possibility you don't remember these
episodes, as you would have to *read* the Sondheim poetry rather than simply
*gaze at it* or *collect it in a folder*--possibly the poet himself can
enlighten us.

Also, I don't dismiss any poetry solely on the grounds of it having such
content; in fact, it's an integral part of the internet culture Alan's work
embodies.  Nor do I have a problem with "ultra-violent" art-- The Wild
Bunch, for instance.  I was only using these descriptive terms in
combination with others to capture what I viewed as the essense of Alan's
project.

By the way, I loved "Contamination," Alan (if you're reading this)-- more
like that, please.

Well,

In light of recent discussions on the list, I think it would be nice if
everyone posted a poem.

A little poem anthology. A poem a day project. A publication
opportunity. Art. Promotion. Advertising, Baby.

I'm not sure if "straight guys talking dirty" refers to me, but if so, I
think it's way off the mark.

The camera materials refer to videos - which have been shown at places
ranging from the Electronic Poetry Conf. to the Bass Museum in Miami to
Millennium here in New York. The work's never been taken as pornographic,
nor was it meant to be; it _does_ analyze sexuality, desire, the break-
down of language in relation to both, and the body as site of inscription.

Net.porn is also very different - you can sense that either from the spam
out there or just by going to newsgroups like alt.sex or alt.sex.bondage
(I assume they're still running).

My work deals with depression and abjection - hopefully not debasement -
and with anomie and arousal as well, but it's not arousing by all accounts
(nor is it intended to me). It hardly leads to masturbation.

I'm fascinated by the possible polarities of the body - on one hand as
flesh, as substance - and on the other - as language /site of language.

Bullets, remember them? While / You were parking your / Girlfriend was

Important Things

It’s so difficult to be serious
about love or death with so many
people dying everywhere.

Look! They’re dropping like flies,
falling, not getting up.
Be careful about making jokes.

The people next door are always
kissing—is this love?  It seems
perfectly normal to me.

Art reflects our deepest concerns,
which may explain the paintings
of food.  They’re called “still-life.”

To be still-born is awful, more
awful for the birther than the birthed.
We love what’s a part of us.

In other countries, people die
all the time. Not so here.  The milk
in the fridge expires. Criminals “go bad.”

One usually goes bad at an early age—
a childhood without love
may cause aberrant behavior later on.

My sex life is unspectacular.
This fact has little to do with love.
My love life is, in fact, great.

Loving cable television and food
too much can result in obesity, laziness,
the loss of a certain sensual acuity.

People who are comfortable w/
their bodies have better sex. One
need not be a model or an athlete.

Two of my grandparents died
on the same day, six years apart.
It was funny-strange, not funny-haha.

“What thou lovest best remains,”
wrote a fascist, some say crazy,
little man from Idaho.

Is it possible to love what can’t
love back?  I love coffee.  I love
Scotch.  I love a girl with long brown hair.

Some people fall in love w/
inanimate objects.  This is called
a fetish, and isn’t always harmful.

Types of love: platonic, agape, eros,
homesexual, heterosexual, homosocial,
old pals, paternal, maternal, fraternal.

Types of death: by fire, by gunfire,
by excessive bleeding, by suicide,
by heart failure, by heartbreak.

The new taxonomy:  broad legal pad;
divide into two sections with a line;
love on one side; death on the other.

Everything important is essentially
sexual.  Sex is unique in the way
it fabulously fence-sits. It can’t decide.

On the legal pad, sex is written sideways
on the line.  Lines can also be borders,
e.g. the space between breast and belly.

I told my best friends I’d be dead by 40.
I’ve got a few years. At my wake, I hope
everyone is in love. I hope people get laid.

The love of poetry is essentially useless
except that it keeps some of us
from ending our lives (and loves) too soon.

There are some people (called hippies)
who love trees and animals
more than people.  How odd!

People in love disgust me—they’re
always making faces and baby
voices and they look so smug.

When I was a soldier, I thought
about killing people.  I never
got the chance.  I wonder what I missed?

My friend Ezra is in love w/
an English Professor.  She studies
“great literature” written by dead men.

The funniest things are also
the saddest.  Nabokov knew this—
I can’t help but laugh at the birds.

It’s odd that one can buy pleasure.
“Self-indulgent, solipsistic,
Doesn’t communicate to anyone.”

When those planes hit those towers
and everything fell, a lot of people
died. It wasn’t particularly funny.

“Arugula” means “rocket” in Italian.
Italian is the language of Lovers.
Dante only found love in death.

A close poet friend of mine (a girl, a beauty)
has never read the Divine Comedy—
What’s so funny about love and death?

It’s fucking hilarious!  The kids
are laughing!  The goats are laughing!
The people you love, alive and dead, are laughing!

Next term, I will be teaching three undergraduate open-enrollment courses
online and one continuing education course online.

English 239: Women in Literature
English 240: Film and Literature
English 133A: Creative Writing:  Poetry (readings in film and poetry)
Surrealism / Writing

Three are available for UC credit.  The West LA CC classes are a mere $33 +
an online fee and begin labor day; UCLA's poetry workshop is their first
available for credit to be offered online, it begins later; the surrealism
course is Otis continuing ed's first online and it is going to be a lot of
fun because we're doing a dada cabaret, surrealist ball, and happening.

I have a little anxiety over the Film and Literature course as I just put it
together in two hours this afternoon.  Right now it is focussing on genre
and adaptation:  I am open to suggestions, and have a syllabus I can send.
Note it is not "Film as Literature."  I would be particularly interested in
comedy -- my mind is blank.  I did find some wonderful Marx Brothers scripts
online, though.

Awake With Your Hatred For This Poetry Story


"I'm others, perhaps they'll hate me."

Yeah, you hate me. I hate you. Crawl for me. Crawl for me. I hate me. You
hate me. I'll do anything you say. You'll do anything I say. You hate
memory, despise it, not the memory of words and language, already hate me.
I love you as one loves a human being, but I do not want to belong to
anything. Teachers hate me. Bosses hate me. To know me is to hate me. I
walk in and say, give me a job, I'll whore for you. I'm others, perhaps
they'll hate me. I turn on this machine praying for excitement - say it
over and over again. There's sense on the other side. I hate me.  Down in
Miami they hate me, they put my image on walls and scratch; to deal with
this stay away. I'm full of poison; you'll hate me when you are asleep.
Nothing comes. Maybe you are awake and hate me. I don't know. I hope not.
I wouldn't want you to hate me. But I am awake totally, sometimes even
more than that. Some of my friends end up hating me, hating me and maybe I
deserve it, difficulty no excuse. You hate me. I don't know. I hope not. I
wouldn't want you to hate me. But I am awake totally, sometimes even more
than that. Some of my friends end up hating me, hating me and maybe I
deserve it, difficulty no excuse. You hate memory, despise it, not the
memory of words and language, already hate me. I hate me. I don't know. I
hope not. I wouldn't want you to hate me. I turn on this machine praying
for excitement - say it over and over again. There's sense on the other
side. I hate you. Crawl for me. I hate me. I hate me. I turn on this

over again. There's sense on the other side. I hate me. I walk in and say,
give me a job, I'll whore for you. I'm others, perhaps they'll hate me.
But I am awake totally, sometimes even more than that. Trust me I'm awake.

Sam, I think about the message I left you when Mary left you. Sam, she
trusted me. We didn't do anything. Why didn't you come by and see what
what going on? Nothing was. You shouldn't have stayed away. You shouldn't
have come back that night either. That changed everything. Mary's never
coming home now. How could she? You broke everybody's trust.

Was awake in the middle of the night. Al Wilson called. I went over his
place. The hall light was on, there was shit everywhere. I mean human
shit, covering the floor, the walls, the stairs, everything. I banged on
his door. What the hell's going on I said. The guy's been here, he said,
the guy who killed all those doctors.  He thought I had drugs. Crazy
junkie. You gotta stay with me he said. Al's place smelled like hell.
Garbage everywhere, his clothes falling off him. Had one set all the time.
That was Al. He ran out the back door to call with the guy screaming at
the front. Forgot a dime for the phone, ran back in, ran out again. That's
when I showed up. I don't remember him playing guitar that night. It was
way before Canned Heat. He was country all the way. That was Al. He
trusted me.

Well, people have suggested that we all start sending our poems to the
list, as a few among the brethren regularly do.
Why not?
Here's one of mine, somewhat fugitive now, and written over a quarter of a
century ago.
It's a little nerdy and far too "sixties", but I think it can take the
cruel critical gaze of the Buffalo Rangers.
And if anyone can provide a complete and workable verbal description of the
non-slip climber's knot, no pictures or gestures allowed, I'd be grateful.
__________________________

Lives of the Poets (prose poem)

Poets are very much the same, thought they differ greatly. The same in
their craft though they differ in that too, being not at all alike in their
approach to their image of themselves and what they think they are capable
of, handling this craft, and even carrying parts of it into the future for
the use of new generations. It's like developing the diesel engine, I
guess, and discovering years later that all that sweat and toil found its
way not into beautiful limousines but into dirty trucks, and to realise
that the drivers are mostly dirty too must be quite a blow; so in that
aspect it's like being an automotive engineer working his way up a blind
alley full of diesel fumes.

There are, no doubt, young poets who start out as old men ready to do 'a
good day's work' and who are prepared to rest content with that little
amount of primitive satisfaction; thus they are seen always as old men who
would be wise and brimming with kissy certainties. They fall into a
'stance' early, and seldom become any less rigid; these we can do without,
though they do have their uses on a cold winter's evening by the fireside
when we are a little tired of life and all its niggling puzzles, and want
to find the cat old and comfortable as much as the occasional book of
'verse' which we are kind enough to read, and happy enough to receive,
frosty evenings being what they are and old men often being warm and
friendly, and thus they are also like doormats full of well-known and
comfortable dust.

Then there are young poets on the make, and often they do indeed make
things, being little more than a blend of stage impresario and greedy kid,
and they need to find something to sell, and they do get it or make it or
imitate something like it, and because of the wheeling and dealing they are
so good at they often end up in politics which is where they should have
begun, except they leave the sky of poetry tainted with their smudge, and
that takes a lot to wipe it clean again, and sometimes the atmosphere is
never clean.

We should leave these fish alone, but we cannot ignore them as thoroughly
as we should, for it is part of their nature to be ubiquitous and coming up
at you in all directions. And further, components of these fellows creep to
the surface in other types of poets; perhaps this is the most important
reason not to ignore them altogether.

So to paint a fuller picture of this seedy alley it is best to abandon the
approach of using 'categories', and their gluey labels, because one fish
will jump out of his bag into another's and eat all the bait. The
advertising agencies will quote Confucius to you, and we had better listen:
a picture is more effective than a thousand words, for example, when trying
to get across the idea of the non-slip climbers' knot. Here, then, is the
picture of the perfect Poet.

He is young, though not for long. He writes all day and most of the night,
but only for a couple of weeks at a time, as the effort tires his
inspiration and he soon falls into alcoholism. Later, just before the
fashion is about to get off the ground, he tries other drugs, but only
because they may be of use to him. They are not of use to him nor to his
poetry, which has begun to grow by now, numbering somewhere in the
hundreds. This is where he has to grapple with several problems other than
his own ability to write, for he has achieved that quite well, and there is
much more to be done with his new equipment.

So the Poet begins to worry about lots of things and that is where we must
leave him. That was not much of a Lives of the Poets, but never mind, there
are plenty of others, though their disadvantage in this context is that
they very much resemble the story you have just heard, so there is little
use repeating them. The Beautiful Children, after all, never existed; and
it is a waste of good salt water to weep for them and their impossible Love.

<font size=3>I suppose we all have our preferences on what we would like
to see on this list, but just as valuable as the posts of the type I
think ought to be posted is the fact of what is posted. In any case, this
list has always encouraged the posting of announcements for publications,
web sites, and&nbsp; readings and there is nothing more useful than those
posts nor anything more fundamental to the founding mission of the list.
Call them advertisement if you like, but if the product in question is
poetry edited or written by a member of the list, or readings organized
or given by list members, then I want more of that not less. One of the
great advantages of the listserv format is that it provides an
inexpensive way for participants to exchange information about
publications and performances. This is not a secondary function, a form
of questionable &quot;self-promotion&quot;, but the very heart of what
this list is for.<br><br>
I also always appreciate lists of recommended reading (books or on web).

OK then, let's join in the play. This is a poem of mine that I actually
like, full of smoky rhetoric but expressing the impasse I feel, of something
about to happen and not happening.

   Wants Happen Amulet

The moon is heavy with the full. Broken cloud,
copper, smoky, aches across it. A smell
of burnt powder, waste, and the loosening stones
of an ancient pile, grey, its pale turretwork
of embattlements, stand inviolate bar
the crackle of a leaf turning, air's yearning,
the remote invisible sentry's tramp
and about, and a concentration
amounting to a mind. That is to say the air's
mind, the not-yet, the nuclear constellations
being born behind the eyes. The time,
delicate as a girl's waist, or a boy's,
sidles by the watch like a breath walking,
in this almost apotheosis of the dark.
An owl hatched out of a storybook
hoots at identity, fur scent blood, and a yew
creaks as if a thought's mass alighted.
Something's about, turns, and a black imprint,
a negative, a prince of all shadows, forms,
all behind scenes, childers to be seen,
of a crowd's heads, a gaggle agog a heard
of eyes. It is time to descend, prince,
you have risen to come down, speak, ghost,
from your high abstracted precipice,
your speech-plinth. Focus, prince, grasp.
While the black feathers of the raven ruffle,
ready to ply inly, and the night-tree
winces at your weight, your firstwords landing:

Literary Analysis meets HCI workshop - London
Deadline: 9 August 2002
Source: UN, 15 July 2002
Submitted by Ann Light

Understanding User Experience: Literary Analysis meets HCI is a one-day
workshop at South Bank University, London on 3rd September 2002, as part
of the HCI2002 conference.

You are invited to participate in an interactive workshop exploring the
potential contribution of approaches from literary and cultural studies
to interaction design. With the confluence of computing and
communications technology and the deeper penetration of computers into
our everyday lives, purely functional construals of human interaction
are limiting progress in our understanding of interaction design. In
today's world, interaction design is as much about fun, entertainment,
community and identity it as it is about work, tasks and goals. This is
reflected in recent concerns to contrast usability and user experience
and to analyse such uniquely human characteristics such as trust and
loyalty and identity.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are
actively exploring the application of new metaphors, models and
approaches from literary or cultural studies to interaction design as
well as those who have a specific interest in these possibilities. The
latter group may include researchers in cultural studies interested in
this application area or developers of interactive artefacts, such as
games or multimedia, where these approaches have clear application. The
workshop's objectives are to begin to develop a research agenda for HCI
practitioners interested in these issues and to help to establish an
active research community.

Literary analysis covers a very broad range of potentially relevant
topics, for example:
* Genre theory provides us with a potentially valuable way of
characterising the relationship between user and artefact in a way that
orients us towards experience and expectation as key components of user
satisfaction.
* Reception theory views the reader as an active interpreter
of texts who forges meaning on the basis of her personal, social and
historical context.
* Dialogism gives us a way of approaching interaction as a perspectival
and creative process.
* Narrative is central in many approaches to understanding human
activity and interaction.
* Deconstructionism is one approach to the analysis of texts and
artifacts that may have analytical value in HCI.

The workshop will be based around position paper presentations and
facilitated and focused discussions. Each participant will be asked to
prepare a response to another position paper and to facilitate
discussion around it. This pre-workshop activity will be critical to the
success of the event and all participants should be prepared to take an
active part.

If you are interested in participating in the workshop please submit a
position paper of no more than 4 A4 pages explaining your interest in
this area and/or summarising any work you have previously undertaken in
this field. Your position paper should indicate how you consider
literary analysis can contribute to HCI (or indeed problems with this
approach) and what you consider to be the most important research issues
in this area.

Position papers should be sent to Peter Wright
(<mailto:pcw@cs.york.ac.uk>). Successful applicants will be notified
soon after August 10th, together with details of the paper they are
required to respond to. A discussion web site will also be provided at
that time.

The outcomes of the workshop will be disseminated at the conference by
the production of a poster and it is hoped that some or all of the
position papers will be developed into contributions for a journal
special issue.

Organisers: Peter Wright (University of York) Janet Finlay (Leeds
Metropolitan University)

Hi all....
I am thinking about writing an essay about how the
advent of the internet has changed poetry -- if it has
changed poetry ... and would be very interested in
input from you.

There are a number of issues that could/should perhaps
be addressed ... among them:

- Do you think the internet has changed *how* poetry
is written? in what way?

- Do you think the internet has changed the way poetry
is being published? Does *that* have an effect on how
it's written?

- Has the greater ease of communication between
writers and interested persons changed poetry?

- is there anything "new" about the net?

This sounds perhaps a bit academic ... I have just
started thinking about it - and find that the internet
has been there ever since I started writing.... so
input from people who remember how it was before would
be greatly appreciated.

- do you use the internet when creating poetry? (for
cut-ups, for instance)

- does (communication on) the internet inspire and
inform your poetry? (content-wise, format-wise,
poetics-wise?) in the same way as "real world"
phenomena do? (is there a difference?)

- are there any questions YOU think should be asked?


(sorry if you have been over this before. If so, I am
also interested in pointers to previous discussions)

what a shock to see he is still male. (:-))

But alcoholism is so much less becoming in women, is it?

In my view, the most interesting avant-garde gesture at the affair was Bob

Seriously Bob, it was good to meet you.  Take care of yourself.  Best, Bill

Jim, this is touching.  And not in a cheap way.

I never met Wieners or heard him read, but am moved by tributes to him on
the EPC & here on the list, as I am by his work.

One objection: the common misspelling of tonight in the penultimate line.

Best line: "you should have vanished/ off the end of a cigarette."

Oh, and an aside to Chris Stroffolino: you started the ball rolling.  Now
where is one of ~your~ poems.

Cheers,

    Complex subjects need complex approaches, we realized,
    looking over the precipice.  Yelling "Help!" is but one
    option, and one not in keeping with our recent

    communication problems.  Only as we're considered
    as a whole, Arielle said.  She was happy with Andrew and Lawrence
    and the novels of various countries.  What's relevant

    is whether or not we can fly, she said.  After this first
    outburst, we became reconciled with her departure.
    Well, that settles that, Millie said.  But she left

    no instructions.  At first all was well, and we enjoyed
    discussing the dullness of genre fiction, and not looking
    down.  But we didn't mean that, we were simply speaking

    in code.  This was no doubt going too far, we thought.
    Maxine was frowning and looked both displeased
    and rather cute in the ticker tape.  Further complications were

    introduced by trying to distinguish between Alan and Aaron,
    though a promising beginning was made by Marjorie and Ron
    out on the ledge.  Of the making of distinctions

    there can be no end, one of them said.  Little specks
    dwindling, the other added.  We're sure going to miss them.
    Stand still.  This's a new rule.  Also alternating

    between standing and falling, that's something, we
    added.  At last there was a faint ice cream truck sounding
    which cheered us almost as much as the self-help books.

    Chris said nothing to Rae about the tale of a fateful
    trip.  For his whole life he's kept faith in his ideals, not
    to mention Armani.  We admired that about him.  As well

    as his always looking on the bright side of life, Sheila grumbled.
    The uniformity of our neighborhoods helps create this, on
    account of the wind, I think.  Unless some clown's

    messed with it, Charles said.  And what a beautiful day.  Monkeys
    and things all around.  The fine reverse slant of the blue
    and white arcs.  The appearance of motion.

COSMIC DEER HEAD FREAKOUT


I.
A disembodied head and leg poke out of a cart set in imaginary states,
conjuring up haunting beings that are half-animal, half-human,
like the deer man in deep-space (2) / deer (18) / deer-antlers (1) /
deer-camp (1) / deer discussion-panel (2) / disembodied-hand (44)....

Watersnake swimming disembodied head stitches seams in the warm pond...
No moon: everywhere in the orchard, deer eyes ...
Watersnake swimming disembodied head ... butterfly ... droplets and froth,
sensing too late the thing which had frightened away the deer ...
a past relic and occult phenomenon manifested
as a talking, thinking disembodied head.
Then he hunts a deer ... you can see his hair waving in the wind
as his disembodied head floats....

A disembodied head bobbed furtively
into his field of view, drifting in from above.
Images: a warrior with a spear holding a circular object above his head;
a disembodied head ...
the two paintings on the left are of a sun, two planets,
and a deer hare being devoured by two falcons ...
the noble man, acquiring the feet of a deer.

Then the camera is pulled back, and he is seen as a disembodied head....

II.
A black prostitute is decapitated by her drug dealer
and her disembodied head is continually sensitive
to diverse ways of "seeing." There are aspects of deer:
1, pregnancy. 1, bizarre. 1, throat-slitting. 1, decapitation.
1, disembodied-head. 1, jeri-curl-hairstyle....
The strange and disturbing skinned deer floating and singing
is replaced by the image of her.

The disembodied head spoke to her in a deep, authoritative voice.
It's a disembodied head called the Silly Slammer, it's ugly as sin,
and when punched it yells "Get a life!" or "Get real!"
Also, its eyebrows are purple.... "Lie back and fast asleep,
if you could see what I could see ... Drip drop a lovely dream...."

She yelps and wipes the blood out of her eyes and pushes ahead,
kicking the disembodied head out of her way.... FORGET ME!! THE DEER!
Instead, she made her way to the disembodied head of hag C-SNO-62 ...
Hag flees thru stormy woods ... C-SNO-63 Grumpy, astride deer....

Then the camera is pulled back, and he is seen as a disembodied head,
with the head hung at the same angle it would have on a living deer.
The glassy eyes stared at Charlie, chiding him.
He jerked the disembodied head....

"Well, my room is much like theirs, only, there was no deer,
or disembodied head of any sort present."

III.
In these episodes, the Principal is shown to be a disembodied head,
then later turns out to be Bugs. Mr. Popular wards him off
by telling him to hunt some deer.

"I've lost various appendages in my struggles with The Specter ...
and have been reduced to a disembodied head.
Did you have to kill a deer right next to me?"

ANSWER ME!!!! I KILL YOU!
"There's a baby deer," I repeated, smiling to him
and still pointing. I could see his disembodied head talking to me,
could see the blood still spurting....
Umm ... it was the little deer over by frozen treats!
(I still wonder why Freihofer's had products other than carrot cake
if they were run by the giant disembodied head of a rabbit)
NOOOOOOOO!!  Bily Corgan's disembodied head:
"So, do you want me to speak to you, or not?"

The disembodied head goes spinning through the air
before hitting the ground with a thud simultaneously with the body.
In the distance, we see a deer run away....

...that voyeurism is not about sex but about knowledge and there is a
critical moment which the voyeur experiences, which galvanizes hir, the
moment of imagined voyeurism, of the visibility and viability of the
object. the voyeur relies on a preparation, the geometric assertion, with
which s/he bolsters hir desired implosion. so it would seem that the net
makes voyeurs of us all; we constantly wryte ourselves, thus hiding the
voyeuristic self further because voyeurism is so diffuse and constant, any
voyeur here, anytime, by looking out the window and seeing what our lives
can only guess. the voyeur gains knowledge about the private habits of
those s/he watches. a slightly different aspect of voyeurism; you on the
contingent moment, the unexpected naked body in the window, and i, on the
voyeur-life, we are inseparable because the voyeuristic relation is
naturally a thwarted sexual act of voyeurism to be "successful"; the
sexual need plays out as the voyeur is ruled by the watched, in a sense -
spellbound, as you say. and it is this submission to the watched which
impels the voyeur to know theoretical interstices, ontologies, epistemol-
ogies, real and virtual. the compulsive voyeur may ask: "why do i do it?
why do i torture myself?"; here (and elsewhere) we diverge; the voyeur's
transgressive moment is amplified and clarified in the voyeur life. that
way of living is all there is for them. the theoretical they produce is
simultaneously a devouring and inscribing of the world that otherwise
would not exist, everything out of sight impossibly trembles.

damaged life held together by a skein of mucilage and damaged life? the
quota is a measure, in fact, of damaged life, of life that refuses damaged
life consciousness of throughout the broken measure of cyberdamaged life.

phenomenology is always already a masochism or always already constructed
in webpage or screen; it splays into littoral, to ash. .net splays mesh
across the same imaginary, it blooms, disperses, splays across domains and
definitions. it processes desire, acts as consort to voyeurisms splaying
the residue or information concerning a particular user - hir flesh. being
splays, displays, called sight, site, citation.

Hey y'all,  I just thought I'd mention that I thing each and everyone one
of you should own Neidecker's Collected Works! (Cal 2002) I felt like I
knew her work pretty well but this collection is a revelation and I'm only
about half way through.  Highlights for me include the uncannily Ashberian
"Stage Directions" and a series of short plays from the mid thirties.
But I keep finding more.  Pick it up!   -m.

I second this--it's a majorly significant and beautiful book, and
beautifully produced--but EXPENSIVE: what, like 45 bucks or something?

Still, I will eventually break down & add it to my shelves.

Waking Up With Arakawa and Gins


Even though his eyes were closed he could perceive
through his opaque lids that the sun was cleaving
the horizon creating both daybreak and nightfall,
the transitive light adhering and cutting a trajectory
of tangerine shadow above, below and upon the edges


For as long as he could remember every morning began -
with his attempts to observe his own invisibility, an insight that
seemed to originate from somewhere within the movement of his body's
self, and with his meditations on the sizelessness of thought which
he knew was absurd and couldn't be measured at all but still he strived
with a level of devotion that could only be described as burning


Each dawn he felt as if he were staring into himself
and that his vision's line was a thick taught rope,
he recorded his awakening impressions, storing them within
the coiled filaments (the feel of his warmed sheets) (the voices
of the congregating sparrows wings as they skipped points toward him)
he felt they aimed their feathered songs into his open window,
into his closed eyes and he rode their tongues to consciousness


He looked forward to pulling the morning into his body
almost as much as he loved pulling the night in, observing how
the back of his eyelids held the aurora in abeyance, he projected
his vision within the blank, spending time discovering thought,
bringing it from transparency to objectification, charting links
between his intentions and actions and when he was ready,
and not a moment before, he would open his eyes

No worries!

Your language problem fits right in here. Some might even call it
down-right artistic.

Poetics List gives new meaning to English as a bastardized language; the
same meaning to English as hacked beyond any public recognition and
therefore interest.

Now listen as listees tell you, (with a glee in their eyes), how they
*distinguish themselves* by their pathetic lack of attention paid to
audience of their writing-product, and how depth and complexity, (read
'obfuscation'), creates opportunity for the reader. What helps them make
multi-signifiers (the ubiquity of their writing), also guarantees
them that pervasive mistakes cannot be so easily recognized. Very
convenient. It is not easy to argue within a foreign subjective
language.

People who develop this unkind-of-writing, also, as luck would have it,
have an school-of-interpretation (langpo), which offers 'consulting
services,' so to speak, to help you review and understand what the
writing is supposed to mean, (i.e. buy this book-of-47-essays/poems to
find out). Of course, there is no conflict of interest here. If these
writers actually allowed their literary work to be *open and accessible*
to the reader, people might - shudder! - understand it themselves, and
then how would these writers be able to look smart ?

Of course, then again, listees will remind you unwarranted complexity
and poor user-design is positioned as 'flexibility within signifiers.'
Go figure. Exactly. It was once ?

luck would have it
luck is not easy to find
out of course
complexity creates opportunity

language
pardon me
no worries
your language

figure exactly
interpretation
to speak
writing is ubiquity
so to speak?
to help you
review and understand
the writing is

posed as hacked
beyond recognition
as hacked paid

mean essay
a gain
unwarranted
unkind
that mistake cannot
be easy within people

pathetic product
your problem fits right beyond any public recognition

buy this?
the literary go figure
foreign themselves

open the reader
to be open
to understand themselves
and understand no conflict

not easy to argue with poor positions

accessible people understand it

writers eye opportunity for the rest

language fits in poetics
speak the reader open
bastard hack

buy guarantees?

THE CAVE CHILDREN OF NEW YORK ARE NEVER FREE

A freedom feels.  Like everyone tells.  The kiss years from now.  Deepened &
opened out onto.  Used to be how anxious.  Decent tries attract buyers.
Them that.  Lessen fears unto the door.  He isn't, is he?  But while the
bravery smears...wakable laxation guillotine.
Letters=attach=novelisme=guiltless=utile=anti=gradule=envelope.  Word aims
diagrams arrive.  At standing postal discretion avowed her another
thankless.  We as them operate.  Youse badger the wiggins but doon power the
mudder-be's.
Draconian measures is stanza understatement.  Hopping swoggle blays toothe
fin.  My antics buy time.  New York creams its afterlife, the single heroic
villager.  Man O man popping.  Destiny player's forgery.  I cambert justice
nor tackle Ho Chi Minh.
Believer yesterday more than concession.  Who would make, anyway?

In an attempt to set the world's record for the most definitions for one word,

I AM SEEKING THE MOST POSSIBLE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS FOR THE WORD :

PRYDXL (version 5.1)

definitions 1-70 are at:
http://cla.umn.edu/joglars/PRYDXL/deflist2.html

these definitions were added to PRYDXL's illustrious compendium of meaning
today by the new collaborative writing elist SPIDERTANGLE
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/spidertangle/

71. A PRYDXL is a ceremony designed to straighten out a painfully bent
penis.  Mainly practiced today as a measure of last resort. John M. Bennett

72. The shortest piece of a C-flute, especially one
bearing a specifically measured trace of tarnish of
the type that results from uniquely wayward
performances of late Baroque scores. Sheila Murphy

73. A new electronic warfare weapon developed by the National Security Agency.
It will allow Pentagon to disrupt enemy servers  & communications by instantly
turning their content into language poetry.  Igor Satanovsky

74. Acronym, the original meaning of which has been lost, used to
categorize artesian well waters from Superfund sites. Joel Lipman

75. (n., archaic) Salve commonly dispensed in bathhouses.  Joel LIpman

76. A she-cat hellqueen, especially wicked or eerie looking one, sometimes
inspired by or having influence over government policies, as it were, a shadow
government or policy distinctions cannot be clearly made or precisely
determined. Lakey Teasdale

ADDENDUM: The noise made by the above cat during affectionate/demonic
backlash. Kathy Ernst

77. Common name for Twenty-Second Century prematurely born synthetic
males. Suffix "La" used for females, e.g., Prydxl-La. Suffix "Le" used
for gender-nonspecific diminutive, e.g., Prydxl-Le. Joel Lipman

78. CORRECTION: Sub-species (threatened) of microscopic butterflies
found only in the Louisiana parishes adjacent to the oil refining center
of Algiers. [Note: There are conflicting opinions on both whether the
PRYDXL is a species or sub-species and as to the definitive status of
its "threatened" status. This information is offered as a
nonpredjudicial addendum to the original definition.]  Joel Lipman

79. The very instant at which psychics begin to channel, the instant something
strikes them, the instant before it becomes a PREDICTION. Kathy Ernst

80. With respect to Kathy Ernst's helpful definition, this "instant"
(PRYDXL) was extensively documented in the tragically evaporated
Compendium of Powers, once housed in the Old Hogwart's Library.
Suspended traces of the document are said to hover over the school's
campus.  Joel Lipman

81. PRYDXL, as it became known in the media, was a particularly embarassing
public relations fiasco for gangster rapper DMX, whose hit "D-X-L (Hard
White),"
as it turned out, included lyrics originally  written by Barry Manilow.

These lyrics can be found  at :
http://www.geocities.com/lyricsdmx/x_lyrics/dxl.html
Igor Satanovsky

82.  According to an ancient manuscript DE NATURA TORTUORUM written by Almeric
de
Padua circa XI cent. the PRYDXL was an instrument of torture used by the
monks in order to extract the confession (by extracting their teeth out) of
guilt of witches and warlocks.  Carlos Luis

Ron!

I'm "sending a poem to poetics" after a 16-month hiatus from the list.
Hello, [some] old friends. Pat Pritchett, are you still here? I have a
bibliographic question for you . . .

DOUBLE HEADER

in the complex nature of baseball
Mike Cameron's baserunning gaffe
(asking for time after sliding into second

instead of going to third on an errant throw)
is good news, as it almost ensures
that he'll do something good later,

but Ichiro homers, absolving him . . .
a very Japanese thing to do
in this pan-Asian city,

summer sun setting below
the lip of the stadium,
Halama in trouble again

the young girl two rows up to the left
leans forward, exposing the top
of the line of her asshole,

her only notable asset
at *this* point, but the game is young,
the earth just three billion years,

the universe fourteen and a third
(the current state of cosmology
in the *NY Times* science section)

a bomber curves left to Boeing Field
ensuring the homeland security
of the citizens at their national pastime

"Alcohol Enforcement" said the tee-shirts
of some solid citizens on patrol
in the vestibule around the concessions

"You see them?" I leaned over
to a long-haired, thirtyish, pockmarked fan
"They make sure you're drinking"

"I like those guys!" surprise Brit accent,
grin splitting his face (Cameron doubles!)
"and if you're in line, they'll buy you a beer!"

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

(five days later)

in the bleachers against Detroit
(Jack Hirshman's favorite team)
Ernie Harwell -- retiring this year --
throws out the first ball
(now Scully stands alone

propped up by Rupert Murdoch --
(and with all the telecom failures
isn't it about time *he* got caught?
Think: no Fox News --
how great a loss could that be?)

young Japanese girls
in kimonos with rainbow sneakers
shirtless in the bleachers
"your Seattle Mariners"
(brought to you by Nintendo)

Halama needs a quick inning
"Isn't that an oxymoron?"
and gets one! So much
for word and thing,
seduction by rhetoric

which poetry ain't, according
to Zukofsky's *Test*,
(recently re-read in preparation
for writing a major poem,
three-dimensional)

second and third no outs
Sierra, who fucked up before
now gets his chance to atone
as this poem treads
familiar ground (a motif)

but he strikes out, calling into question
the content, but not the integrity
of the poetic line, where
there are no mis-steps possible
(whether that applies to life

is not treated in this report)
but Cameron and Ben Davis
"the catcher of the future"
come through, three-three tie,
baseball rivaling Pythagoras

in its fascination for whole numbers
(the pen almost running out of ink
an effect unreproducible
in words on a computer screen
unless Alan Sondheim can do it)

five-thirty, Ben Davis
(the catcher of the present)
singles! he's three for three,
five forty five, seventh inning stretch
falling in love with the nominative . . .

in the interminable wait
for a pitching change
the electronic "noise" sign
invariably flashes,
postponing at least

the aborted attempts
at starting a wave
(right-to-lifers getting
bankruptcy protection
along with giant corporations)

time for the six o'clock news
we're gonna rock around the clock tonight
(and at six eighteen the sound system
plays Bill Haley's version of that song!)
while Ichiro checks out the kimonoed girls

and the pen runs out of ink again
so I dip it in spit, write
on my heel (like Whitman),
drop it on the ground
reviving my precious quill

as we head into extra innings
more bang for your buck
or "last inning, the tenth!"
as I heard a young boy
at my father's children's ware store

say in 1963, even then
scorning his ignorance
before Scully's golden throat
smoothed everyone's nerves . . .
a gathering at the mound,

Cameron walks, loading the bases,
the infield and outfield come in
McLemore bats for Ben Davis
(the catcher of the past)
and it's a suicide squeeze . . . (!)

 those of you who are sending poems to the list--
could you please mention this in your subject
heading...? (so people who are interested in the
poetics side of the list can deal with them
accordingly).

Thank you.

Mutation 18


Push fish peels into five locks for landscape extraction procedures.
Bend window panels, eat crust pinches, make piles of hammers.  Look, the
godawful
oxidant clouds (I saw those people extruded through no reason).  Storefront.
Not one I generalizes you, not if written with bending anonymous arms
or with axed rotting memories misnamed "Forgotten".  (Inquire without).
Extant random selections shelve narrow groups.  Down on some ideas lulled
into curbing repeated implicating mutters?  Ask about whatever happened
to our capricious invisible aphasias, the ones we never had.

I'm having problems accessing www.vorpleword.com.  Has the
URL changed or has it been removed from the server?

Your work is most interesting and I was so glad to learn
about it (from Dr. Ed Clausen at Daemen) and that you would
let us include it on our CIEL website
(http://www.cielearn.org/daemen_work.php). If you have a
photograph of yourself we could include, I would appreciate
your sending it.  Right now there is an image from the
vorplesword website itself, serving as a reference to the
project.

Again, thanks, and I'll look forward hearing from you.

I would vote for no change if the listowner and moderator are considering any such thing.  As far as I'm concerned it works well like it is and has established itself over the years as the premier site of poetry and poetry gossip despite incursions by attention seekers.

some news
some gossip
some quips
some ads

keeps me alive and writing

there is a phenomenon on the internet of people joining lists without looking through the archives to see what they are getting into and then wanting to change what they are getting.    For example, Alan's poems and other occasional poems have been a part of the list for years.  I may be getting old but I'd like some stability in my life.  Would like to see a return of the rengas but I think that's not easily done.

A fairly recent poem, written in a brew pub in seattle


Genetically Modified Rain



rain stomps down my face like a juice with legs=97

face-time i cant face the place walls shedding like tarantulas

while fundamentalists of the silly get their beaks in a satellite

twisting former belongings til they rise begging for seeds

to hitchhike on the back of the world like a highly compressed & =
divergent slinky

carving stairways into cheese-board i thicken with delight with positive =
alignment

of weather, attitude and altitude=97a 6 point compass with holographic =
predictions

rolling dice for every person in the world every second, voice talking =
bout

low pressure data fronts, information stagnation, record highs

til the dawn of two long muscular legs, hair like well-ironed raven =
wings

a 12 story building could hide inside cubing its own history

with walls of unwrapped packages change shape with the wind speed & dow =
jones

of microbial muscle-exchange follows the mitochondria back to 7 mothers

changing the world with 7-fngered godlngs, as if 1 continent =
internalized in each of us

looking from the inside out our impermissible coast lines warped from =
birth

by cloth and design. like when i get somewhere ive never been

that seems familiar, as each coin remembers its mold=97the shape moms =
canal assumed=97

such narrow connections between such large worlds

as if each notch in the coastline is a soul=92s cycle, notches in the =
lungs gun:

each april i wake up chewing til im solid again

like a glacier so deep in the back of my head i hear it echoing

where memory has not yet moved in

Le petit train



Confused over his relationship with his stepfather, believed to be his =
father, he wrote a great deal about him (hereinafter referred to as =
"father"). Quotations indicate that introspection is about to occur, as =
in Henry James. Buddhist stories end by pulling the rug out from under =
the reader, while sweeping as little as possible under. My toys under =
dere! "It takes a lot of hard work to publish a book, I know," she said, =
meaning the library was not interested in mine. (Little did we know it =
had the first.) I want go airport! He went to Paris to sort out the =
parental relation, and the racism that enclosed him like a box. They =
acted out "Boxcar! Boxcar! Boxcar!" in class, while I smoked. The train =
is talking, he says, when it hoots. He began his life as Jumbo, but the =
white women elephants renamed him Dumbo, mercilessly attacking his =
prolific ears; only later in the film does Dumbo meet the Jim Crows, =
whose magic feather enables him to fly. Disney bought the miners' =
stories for $150K each. That we write collages may dispirit us, letting =
in the very material we want expurgated, or at least investigated. To be =
led away in handcuffs is the poet's dream, if not for defrauding the =
public of their 401(K)s: we regret to inform you that your poetic legacy =
has been spent unwisely and that you will be unable to pursue your love =
of it in retirement. Lacking water sports, they seek the indoor life. I =
remember his drooping eyes, and above all his voice. Cigarette smoke, =
and the sound of whiskey in his throat. Who has not filled his baggage =
by age 20 will not have a life as a writer, his elder said. I know I =
can, I know I can. Who is not part of me can still remember me.=20

*  Color Them Red: The Universe is Beige
March 7, 2002 AP

    BALTIMORE, March 7 --   Astronomers who announced in January (see
The Cosmic Spectrum and the Color of the Universe By Karl Glazebrook &
Ivan Baldry http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~kgb/cosspec/)that they'd determined
the color of the universe will publish a paper on their broader results
in April. When they do, the footnote describing the color of the
universe finding will cite beige, not the originally announced
turquoise.=20
   "It's our fault for not taking the color science seriously enough,"
said an apologetic Karl Glazebrook, an assistant professor of astronomy
in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences at The Johns Hopkins
University. "I'm very embarrassed. I don't like being wrong, but once I
found out I was, I knew I had to get the word out."=20
   Glazebrook noted that before the color finding's odd nature led to
widespread public interest, it was originally just a footnote to a
comprehensive survey of the spectrum of light emitted by 200,000
galaxies. He and co-author Ivan Baldry, a Hopkins postdoctoral fellow,
had set out to simply compile a "cosmic spectrum" based on data gathered
by the Australian 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. =09

well this was originally
supposed to be a note
but i have a tendency to
overdue things,
you should know

that the words that
themselves are
almost nothing
hide the true world

yes why not call it

Subject:      More Mixed Up Books at Arthur Andersen (fwd)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Lorenzo Thomas passed this on.

Today's Houston Chronicle (Saturday, 2 August) reveals yet another twist in
the Enron/Arthur Andersen debacle. See the article entitled "A writer is not
a writer . . ."  by Mary Flood on the Op-Ed page (via the Internet at
http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1519752


A writer is not a writer . . .

    As if getting a guilty verdict against withering accounting firm Arthur
Andersen wasn't enough, now the federal government is challenging the firm's
literary sophistication.

    Andersen, found guilty of obstruction of justice by a Houston jury in
June, asked U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon for a new trial in the
shredding case. In doing so, its lawyers called the verdict illegitimate and
said, "the government's case thus brings to mind Virginia Woolf's famous
observation: There is no 'there' there."

    This week the U.S. Department of Justice's Enron Task Force filed its
opposition to Andersen's new trial request, using the same quote but noting
its author was Gertrude Stein. Andrew Weissmann, the prosecutor who penned
the government response, uses a footnote to tell the judge, "the barb was
made by Stein, not Woolf, in reference to Oakland, Calif."

    "I hope they realize it was an innocent mistake and we are not looking at
another indictment," said Rusty Hardin, Andersen's Houston lawyer.

    Weissmann said they will not be taking the literary infraction to a grand
jury. "We understand mistakes happen, and we imagine Mr. Hardin's copy of
Gertrude Stein's work has been shredded."

    Andersen's motion was kind of close. Both women were turn-of-the-century
feminist writers who died in the 1940s and both were known for the circle of
fellow writers, poets and artists they cultivated to create fashionable and
thoughtful salons.

    But Stein, an American living mostly in Paris, was known for her
insightful writing and her oddly wise grammatical play. Her most famous work
is The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, her own memoir named for her lover.
She also, however, was known for statements like: "A rose is a rose is a
rose," to make the point that a thing is what it is; and, "There's no there
there," to comment on her dissatisfaction with American suburbia.

    Woolf was a British author whose husband edited and published some of her
work after she killed  herself. Her best-known work may be A Room of One's
Own.

    Judge Harmon, a graduate of Radcliffe, is likely to both appreciate a
proper literary citation and find against Andersen's fairly hopeless motion
that the case be set aside or retried.

Hope the rest of your summer is happy & literate!

The general disinterest in poetry shown by contemporary Anglophone
philosophy is undeniable, but might be simply a reflection of (1) a
tradition of other main interests holding center stage and (2) a general
sociocultural consensus here and now that serious poetry is of strictly
marginal specialist interest.  It need not reflect some pernicious lack
in the way the (best) analytic philosophy is pursued, or rule out the
possibility that some of the last century's copious 'analytical' work in
semantics might be of some relevance in understanding poetic meaning.

It astounds me that Saussure is still taken seriously in poetic circles
as he struggles to explain the ordinary meaning of words like 'mouton'
or 'arbre' (a laudable effort in itself) while ignoring Mallarme, surely
the main thrust of the primitive semantic theory of the Cours, while
Frege and his successors are deemed not worthy of study at all,
presumably because they are thought (wrongly) to have dealt only with
uninteresting mathematical expressions and to have been some sort of
'positivists'.

The question originally asked about philosophers writing about poetry
might be turned around: how many serious poets or critics are capable of
understanding or have taken any trouble seriously to understand some of
the good work in modern Anglophone philosophy?

Getting off-track slightly, some recent books by a (here little-known)
Frenchman, Jean-Pierre Cometti, who is familiar with contemporary
analytic philosophy, have tried to indicate a path towards a
Wittgensteinian treatment of contemporary art (the focus is on
visual/performance/installation art, but there are some remarks on
poetry) which seems to me rather suggestive (and much more cognizant of
what Wittgenstein was about than, say, Perloff):

La Maison de Wittgenstein
Art, modes d'emploi
L'Art sans qualities

Jacques Bouveresse's book Dire et ne rien dire, treating the philosophy
of nonsense after Frege and Wittgenstein, may also turn out to hold
something of value for poetic aesthetics.

poetry & poetics are inseparable... i suppose that not everyone can be happy
with the way the list is run all the time... but, Barbara, you're getting
poetry (for free! to your own computer!) from some of the most interesting
poets writing today, and you're (politely) wishing that you could ignore
them more easily?  count yourself lucky to be on a listserv where poetry
offers so clear a window into poetics.  And buy the new issue of Verdure,
which might give you more of what you want.  [also the Niedecker can be
found cheaper and is, yes, definitely worth the money (since the only other
option is Bertholf's version, which is really, really expensive)...I thought
there was a paperback version forthcoming?  anyone know?]

also Alan, i think it's probably not helpful to divide the list into
Language and non-Language (ha) camps.  so-called Language poets aren't all
poetics all the time (here's Ron defending the idea of poetry on the list by
posting his own work); and people who've complained about your work aren't
the same people as the Language poets (if i remember correctly, Charles and
Barrett have both defended your right to post poetry).

Everybody on the list (presumably) likes poetry, likes reading about poetry
(poetics), likes hearing about where to see or hear poetry (so they can go
or buy)... so if any of you guys don't want to read a certain kind of
message, get your messages digest-ed and just scroll through.  Or if you
want to read fully-fledged poetics (which is also sometimes poetry, ie A
Poetics), go to the library... I think it's fantastic to see (new) poetry
that entails or instigates new ways of thinking about poetry (--> poetics)
(sandra guerreiro's work, for instance).  keep it comin'.

i've been puzzled about this for some time.  isn't it "uninterest"?  i
thought disinterest meant something quite different --impartiality.  but
enough well-educated people have been using "disinterest" that i've started
to wonder.

Cole Swensen wrote: This is great! And it reminds me of something =
Michael Friedman was
doing last year, and that was to have people give him "outlines" for =
poems, to which he'd
then write the poem.  Cole listed a rather long and complex outline with =
five sections, but
I chose one section alone, section 4: Gradual retreat of the =
point-of-view, allowing broader
and broader perspective. Perhaps I'll attempt all five elements later.

It was the ant on my arm and not
the older woman I was holding up
that made me giggle--the coincidence
of my mother's sister staring into
space while I was so intensely
focused on the field of weeds
my body hair had accidentally
invented for the small insect.
A simple breeze brought the subject
to its knees, and she looked up:
Help me please! There was nothing
I could do, even in the lift
from where she'd gone
I already knew the other
was perfectly at home there.

Generally, this is the very kind of poem I hate: a sort of short =
narrative all plotted out and seemingly
predigested. And with a very singular meaning yet! In the first version =
it was even worse: I'd dramatized
so thoroughly that I had a heliocopter speeding the old aunt away from =
where (I'd had a final line) she
would one day lay. Just awful!
=20
But it was Cole's suggestion of the broadening of perspective that had =
brought out the narrative--as in
film almost. And since I truly had not planned it out, just beginning =
instinctively with a focus on something
very minute and particular, I kind of liked the poem in the end. I find =
narrative so easy that I am sure I
could find a way to link every thing I've ever read or done in some way. =
So I often have to take the
narrative and dramatic elements out of my work or the words would drown. =
Yet when I work in
fiction and drama, strangely enough, I can never imagine a plot--unless =
it's that in which the aunt will
soon find herself.

THE BENEFIT PARTY
for 6x6 and New York Nights
6$ door-donation, with complimentary copy of 6x6#6, and other gifts from the presse

 In March, a fire destroyed the apt.-HQ of two of New York's very special periodicals: 6x6, a poetry journal put out by Ugly Duckling Presse since 2000, and the free newspaper New York Nights, a joint effort of Ugly Duckling and the Loudmouth Collective, on the street every three weeks since the war began in October.

Many back issues and submissions were lost in the fire and resources for continuing publication were scarce.  Though delayed by these events, the new New York Nights is out, and the new 6x6 is to be officially released at the party.  6x6 #6 is a two-year anniversary special issue, with hand-made cover.  Ugly Duckling Presse is celebrating this release with readings, happenings, music and performances.

I.

True- is reassuring,
Truly is not.
But keep that flicker of light,
I know was there, still
laughing with its playful mate,
while you compose words
to carry.

There is a memory
it flashes before you
a constant aching,
as you beg for the keeping
of resistance. Stay true,
I am too, here
breathing your watchtower.

How to remember
without feeling,
this something here with me,
breathing you so quietly alive,
this side of me,
how do I know, that me here with so much
equals not, you having to live
something without.

True, as the jingle goes: I before E except after C.

Oddly, a couple days ago I ran across some old letters I wrote when I
visited Niedecker's grave, and I'd forgotten this, but on her
tombstone it's spelled Neidecker.

Will a poet's name go un-misspelled?  make that "Stephen" or rather, Steve.
As this is my last post of the day, I feel it must be more substantial, so
here are two Malmude poems from _The Bundle: Selected Poems_
(Subpress/Goodbye, 2002):



THE LITTLE DAUGHTERS

Little daughters
in the middle of the night
why are you not
asleep again yet?

The stomping ground
must always die down
and be
curtained away!

But we don't mind
being looked at
we like it!

We lie awake
for hours
with happiness actually.




ONCE I EXPRESSED

Once I expressed
myself as someone
who had summered
with some artists

when poverty was
a thing of youth
and shyness
cost me nothing

o for the puzzle
of personalities
copping their buzz
on a regular basis

at the first note
of character
I was not floated
by art any more.

2.

Authenticity is comforting,
if one trusts provenance,
some eye or other at a playmate
freighting her with words
from a sticky compositor;
but otherwise still,
white light of a sigh,
rolled up, rolled up...

Commemorate them, without sentimentality.
In that way they are still alive,
as much as is your ram -

OK armed police!

cling on to what is fleeced;
resist the desire to fall for it,
give in to that passion and next you drown in bull,
Zeus and Hera playing silly buggers
in whatever guise.
And so the years pass.

Keep the light still! Its flicker is gaudy!

They read you their rites
and start to bury you.
Memory dazzles.
Incessant burning.
Read, write, completed with error.
Photographs and books divided.

Put your clothes on.
Who's this with you?
Looks dead to me.

A swiki is a webpage which is editable by who ever wishes to write
changes to it.  I thought it might be interesting to see what comes of
this style of web interwriting.  Make a bookmark for the page & visit it
often. New pages can be created & added to it.  To alter an exisiting
page just click on edit at the top of the page.  For further
modifications read the very brief help link.  We could easily use this
site to create a group hypertext longpoem.  An interesting feature of a
swiki is that literally anyone can come & erase a page, spam it etc, but
all pages save a history so any page can always be reverted to a
previous history.  Another useful feature is that typically you are
always adding to the latest version tho Im not sure what would happen if
a number of people all save different versions to the same page at the
same instant.  People may also upload jpegs & gifs. Im unclear how
much server space is available so keep em small.

PRYDXL- Confusion of pry and spy, meaning to use leverage to raise up a
heavy object so that you can glimpse what's underneath (Partridge's ORIGINS,
o.o.o.) unconventionally combined with the suffix dix-hsyll, corrupt Old
Danish,  supposedly meaning to "let down heavily," so that the term has been
diffidently used by scholars to imply " the making of  a discovery without
being able to have time to identify whatever was there to be discovered or
if it was there at all."

Great performance, yours!

RESEARCH SUMMARY: Anticipation of Laughter

Actual Title: The Anticipation of a Laughter Eustress Event Modulates =
Mood States Prior to the Actual Humor Experience
L.S. Berk, D.L. Felten, J. Westengard*
Susan Samueli Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, UC =
Irvine College of Medicine, and *Loma Linda University School of =
Medicine, Loma Linda, CA.=20

Lay Summary Title: The Positive Anticipation/Expectation of a =
Humorous/Laughter Eustress (Positive Emotional) Experience Begins to =
Change Mood States Before the Actual Humor Event-A Concept of Hope=20

The present study demonstrates that anticipation/expectation of a one =
hour experience of mirthful laughter, in the form of viewing a humorous =
video, evokes significant positive changes in mood states prior to the =
actual viewing of the video, providing new insights into the =
psychobiology of anticipation/expectation. Previous work from our =
laboratories has demonstrated that viewing of a self-selected humorous =
video for one hour can ameliorate (amend) many of the physiological =
effects of distress. Many forms of chronic stress result in suppressed =
immune responses, particularly those related to anti-viral and =
anti-tumor defenses. These diminished immune responses appear to be the =
result of increased secretion of stress hormones such as cortisol and =
epinephrine. Mirthful laughter diminishes the secretion of cortisol and =
epinephrine, while enhancing the anti-viral and anti-tumor immune =
reactivity. In addition, mirthful laughter enhances the secretion of =
growth hormone, an enhancer of these same key immune responses. The =
biological effects of a single one-hour session of viewing a humorous =
video can last from 12 to 24 hours, while other studies of daily =
30-minute exposure to such humor/laughter videos produces profound and =
long-lasting changes in these measures.=20

The present study builds on these previous observations, and on further =
rather surprising findings that if subjects are informed 3-days prior to =
the humor intervention that they will be "a subject in" the experimental =
laughter group (watching the humor video) rather than the control group =
(sitting in comfortable chairs reading magazines of their choice), these =
experimental subjects demonstrate a striking decrease in stress related =
negative mood states and an increase in a positive mood state. As a =
result of the present study, we further hypothesized that the same =
anticipatory behavior or positive expectation that led to altered mood =
states, also would lead to stress hormone (neuroendocrine mediator) =
changes prior to viewing of the humor video.=20

In this study we administered the Profile of Mood States (POMS), an =
instrument that measures changes in tension, depression, anger, vigor, =
fatigue, and confusion to 10 fasting male subjects (mean age 27 years) =
at time points 2 days before, 15 minutes before, and immediately =
following, the humor intervention of viewing of a self-selected 60 =
minute video. The POMS scores in each of the six areas were charted =
longitudinally and compared with published standardized test norms for =
the POMS. The table below shows the relative percentage decreases or =
increases in mood states.=20

Test subjects demonstrated a progressive pattern of significant =
decreases in depression, tension, fatigue, confusion, and anger =
(significant at a level of p<.001) and a significant increase in vigor =
(significant at a level of p<.01). Changes in mood states began prior to =
the viewing of the humor video, and continued through and after the =
one-hour laughter intervention. This positive pattern of altered mood =
states represents a "eustress" profile that is counter/opposite to that =
provoked by classical stress (distress).=20

In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that anticipation/expectation, =
as much as the humor intervention episode, can initiate changes in mood =
state prior to the actual experience itself. We suggest this may =
parallel neuroendocrine stress hormone changes that also occur with this =
type of humor/laughter intervention. Our findings provide both =
psychosocial (mood state changes) and suggestive neuroendocrine =
(cortisol, epinephrine, growth hormone) correlate changes as a result of =
anticipation. Further studies should be done to definitively show that =
anticipation of favorable positive interventions, such as mirthful =
laughter and possibly others eustress behaviors, may initiate changes in =
the secretion of important biological mediators that, indeed, may =
positively contribute to wellness and counteract many adverse changes =
related to chronic stress.=20

We believe that the "biology of hope" that underlies recovery from many =
chronic disorders includes, in part, the synonyms optimism, =
anticipation, expectation of positive interventions and experiences. If =
complementary and integrative interventions/adjunctive therapies, =
directed towards wellness and recovery from chronic diseases, can =
incorporate positive expectation or anticipatory experiences ( "hope," =
the resultant changes may not only 1) contribute to beneficial positive =
mood state changes; but also, 2) modify important biological/chemical =
mediators that optimize immune responses; 3) diminish stress-related =
molecules and inflammatory mediators; and in total 4) potentially =
contribute to the prevention and healing processes.=20

Father's Poem, Son's Conviction
By Sergey Kuznetsov

2:00 a.m. Aug. 5, 2002 PDT

from Wired

Shohdy Naguib Surur will soon find out whether he has to pay for the
alleged sins of his father.

Shohdy, 40, was sentenced in June to one year in a Cairo jail for
posting his father's poem on the Internet but has so far avoided
incarceration as he awaits an appeal on Aug. 26.

Shohdy is the first person charged for online publishing of a poem. If
he loses the appeal, he will be Egypt's first Web prisoner of
conscience.

He was born in Moscow to a Russian mother and a famous Egyptian poet,
Naguib Surur. Shohdy, 40, is one of Russia's online pioneers and one of
the founders of the first Russian online magazine, Zhurnal.ru.

A few years ago he moved to Egypt and began to work as a webmaster for
the influential Egyptian English-language newspaper Al-Ahram. In Egypt,
he wrote articles for Al-Ahram and Russian periodicals.

Shohdy had been an Internet activist in Russia and he continued his
political activity in Egypt, so it wasn't a surprise when he became the
first to translate "A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace," by
John Perry Barlow, into Arabic.

After posting his father's poem -- a bitter reflection on the state of
Egyptian society and culture after Egypt was defeated in the 1967 war
against Israel -- Shohdy was arrested in November 2001. In the poem,
Naguib Surur condemned Egyptian government and politics, using explicit
sexual imagery and colloquial street Arabic. Even the poem's name, in
fact, is graphic.

The poem was never published in Egypt but has been disseminated there
through underground tapes of Naguib Surur's readings. Three years ago,
the poem was posted on the U.S.-hosted website managed by Shohdy
("wadada" means love in Sanskrit). Soon after his arrest, the poem was
removed from the site.

Since no law regulates Internet publishing in Egypt, Shohdy is charged
with possessing "immoral booklets and prints." Egyptian officials are
trying to present the case as a pornography violation, but there is no
doubt that the case is politically motivated.

"The site was blacklisted on Islamic sites and proxied off by the
'traditionalists' of the Arabian Peninsula," Shohdy said. "I hate to
think of facing the dogma institutions and their ardent supporters in
the courtroom. They lack a sense of humor in their exercise of righteous
judgment, while the poem is fire and brimstone of a sort, but with
humor."

Even though Shohdy was one of the site's administrators, the prosecutors
have not presented evidence that Shohdy was the actual publisher of the
poem.

After Shohdy's arrest, a few international human rights support groups,
such as Index on Censorship, spoke in his defense. Since Shohdy is
well-known in the Russian Internet community, many Russian newspapers
published articles in his support.

"It's not just (an) Egyptian case," the Russian Internet activist Nastik
Gryzunova said. "This disgusting case of breaking the free expression
rights illustrates the Internet censorship problem. Plus it brings up
the issue of the international laws and the Internet, because the server
where the poem is published is the hosted in the U.S.

"These problems are topical not just for Russia or Egypt, and we hope
the international Internet community will support Shohdy Naguib."

"In the most Islamic countries," Shohdy says, "I wouldn't even have a
chance to appeal. However, I don't believe (I will be let go)."

Just back from a weekend in beantown and environs. The pleasure of seeing my
daughter in Boston was compounded by a fieldtrip to The Grolier Poetry Book
Shop in Cambridge on Plympton Street.  Louise Solano owns and operates this
postage stamp sized store which is celebrating its 75th anniversary.  Solano
is the third owner in the history of the store. She's had it for the past 27
years-- which, as she pointed out to me, is virtually as long as I've been
writing and publishing. And she should know.  She's sold and continues to
sell my publications since the early 80s.  The store is a terrific resource
in Cambridge but also a boon to poets and publishers throughout the United
States.  Looking for a hard to find poetry book?  It's another place to try.

Actually, being a customer is a little annoying too.  You  get followed
around if you insiste on browsing rather than asking the prproetor for
specific books...  I always get creeped out when I go there, and end up
buying my poetry books right next door at teh Harvard Book Store or else at
the Coop.  But that was when I had a Boston connection...

In NYC, the best poetry stores seems to be St. Mark's Bookstore, Labyrinth,
and Gotham Book Mart (Gotham would rate higher, only their books are a mess
and rarely in great condition even if "new."  Some of the Barnes and
Nobles's (heresy!) have decent poetry sections, too, like Bway & 82nd
Street, but sometimes the sections are big due to trashy poetry...

Tom: My posting does nothing either way to the artwork--though there is a
printer-friendly version that eliminates the ads, but also the photo of the
piece. But as we can see from the image

http://graphics7.nytimes.com/images/2002/08/05/arts/05arts.jpg

the work precisely is about interweaving noncommercial messages in a
commercial context. So, it would be closer to the artist's intention, here,
to have the work corrupted by its presentation in a commercial-saturated
media environment, would it not? Call it mediation.

                         Recall

Ian Randall Wilson of Santa Monica, California is voluntarily recalling
approximately 255 poems written between June 1998 and July 2002.  The
metaphors in the poems can break loose and detach posing a choking and
aspiration hazard to young women.  Additionally, the poems may have sharp
adjectives which protrude on the paper side that can cause serous hand or
body lacerations.  The Consumer Product Literary Safety Commission and Wilson
have received 3 reports of injuries from the metaphors and 15 reports of
injury from the adjectives.  In one case, Wilson received a report of a 24
year-old woman who inhaled a metaphor that detached from one of the longer
poems into her sinus cavity.  She required medical treatment to remove part
of her nose.  Adjective injuries include scrapes, deep lacerations and
bruises of the heart.  Several readers required stitches and extended
psychotherapy.  For more information, readers of these poems are encouraged
to call the number below.

Hmmm...First of all, it was great to meet you finally, and your presentation
still rings in my mind. Secondly, are  transportation expenses paid for?
I  wrote things for the PCAC when it first started, and I've got something I
think would go over as a visual-poetic work preceded by a several-page intro
on the concept. Do let me know about transportation.

Best wishes,

Irving

Sorry, Barrett, I was having a snide morning.  I also didn't intend to
single your post out.  I was thinking more of the commercialization of the
internet here in the land of the big bucks.  I was also responding I think
to the real plight of someone like Clemente and what he's been going through
which has passed unnoticed on this list and on webartery.  I happen to think
what he's doing is every bit as interesting as the stuff noted in the
NYTimes piece.  But then, if he wasn't fashionable twenty years ago, there's
no reason he should be noticed by the cognosenti now?

you can see some of the stuff he and others like mIEKAL, Reiner, and Ted
were doing five yearsago on the wr-eye-tings scratchpad -

maybe I'm just crotchety these days? heat here is 104.

when i was last there she told me that the reason that she had to
follow people around was due to shop lifting.  apparently students
from brown had made it a contest to steal from her. she said that one
of them admitted to this in an article in some magazine. i meant to
follow up with her but i left cambridge without returning to the
store.

she may be a crank, but poetry is full of cranks.  in fact, some of
my best friends are cranks, and i would expect nothing less

pretty soon there will be no more stores like hers.  barnes & noble
and borders have arrived in ithaca.  the bookery is still going
strong, but...

Dear Mr Wilson:

I have had just such an experience & would like to file my claim but you do not
list your number.  Perhaps you have something to hide or you are not truly
committed to the liberation of metaphors & their antebellum cousins, similes.

 Hi Lawrence,

I may be wrong but wasn't the internet initially developed by military-funded researchers in the 1970s?

A community-based www would be a possibility I'd embrace though.

Cheers,

Cassie

 Dear Poetics,

Some friends and I are interested in doing a good practical and/or theoretical art class this fall in the SF Bay Area.

If anyone has recommendations for either graduate courses or 'open university'-type classes they'd be much appreciated.

Thank you

Cassie

Personally,
I'm with Millie on this one.
I find the atmosphere of said bookstore:
oppressive, claustrophobic and unfriendly.
It has been rumored, by someone on the list,
last year methinks, that the proprietor of said
establishment is blatantly suspicious and
untrusting of anyone who appears to show
interest in anything 'alternative' in nature.
I find this to be the case unequivocally,
and choose not to frequent the store.
I find it useful only a last ditch alternative,
to which  I must, sometimes, begrudgingly submit.
In my humble opinion, there should be a more
'loving' place for poetry to call home.

The Internet was initially developed by military and academic bodies while
the www was the brainchild of CERN and in particular Tim Berners-Lee.

So we have science, the academy and the brass all accidentally coming
together. But not commerce.

she once gave me a big discount on a joan retallack
book because she said "you seem to like it so much";
then she gave me a liz waldner book for free because i
convinced a fellow shopper to buy a book she was
looking at.

that don't happen at barnes and noble (or likely, at
the harvard bookstore...)

Black Iris


Her face a light in black iris. Her body
the flight of limbs stretching and sweat
rolling hips and lush. Lips swindled kisses
in a pact of fire.  Long touch and a brush,
a shatter charge a wire from neck to
a breast. Wax crescent to her corola
flushed crimson and unfolding. Ignite. Slide

not sure where i ever said that the www was founded by commerce...or where i
said that the www was the brainchild of commercial entities...what i do
remember saying was that the www (as it exists now...nevermind where it
started) would cease to exist without commerce...

we could go around this numerous times (& along the way hope for
alternatives), but in order for the www to operate, things must be sold,
bought, & paid for...servers must be built, pipelines to the www must be
leased, bandwidth must be purchased, etc...

can't understand why this is so hard to accept...

--Minogue, there's a good article about her in this week's PEOPLE (US
version) the one with the cover about J.Lo & Ben Affleck's Red-Hot
Romance.  It's on page 85 and 86 if you're standing in grocery line
and have to flip to it quick.  The article's accurate as far as I can
tell and will help dispel many myths that have arisen around this
strange cult figure.  Nice pictures too, a bizarre one of Kylie
visiting with her difficult younger sister Dannii, backstage, in
front of a multi-part vanity mirror that reveals the back of their
heads--very Vermeer.

Also, "People" has a panel of experts who predict the winner on
AMERICAN IDOL is going to be -- Kelly Clarkson!!!

Who'd a thunk it?

The people who run the TLD's are the people who could - possibly - "break" the
internet. The DNSroot managers - rather than ICANN (who are currently making a
pig's ear out of it) - are the ones who effectively "control" the internet.
ICANN is supposed to run it - and I quote

"ICANN is the global, non-profit, private-sector coordinating body acting in the
public interest. ICANN ensures that the DNS continues to function effectively by
overseeing the distribution of unique numeric IP addresses and domain names.
Among its other responsibilities, ICANN oversees the processes and systems that
ensure that each domain name maps to the correct IP address."

from http://www.internic.net/faqs/authoritative-dns.html

but see

http://www.proper.com/ICANN-notes/dns-root-admin-reform.html

It seems that ICANN is this disruptive layer over and above the actual root
managers, who seem to be non-commercial entities answerable to no one, who
manage it quite nicely, thankyou.

No, commerce did *not* invent the Internet - that was DARPA.

back for returning books from large publishers
such as Doubleday, Harpers Perennials, etc.
because I convince fellow shoppers not to buy
the returned books.

that don't happen at Grolier or any other Indy bookstore

Be well

Dear All,
Thank you to the many poets on this List who sent me poems.  Your poems will
bless my marriage to "Mr/s Poetry" this Saturday in Berkeley, CA.  If you are
in the Bay Area (CA) and can make it to the exhibition opening which is free
and open to the public, please be sure to introduce yourself.  (And: Catalina
Cariaga will play the ukelele!)

All Best,
Eileen Tabios

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact: Dori Caminong  (510.549.1808)
Pusod Center
1808 Fifth Street
Berkeley CA 94710

Saturday, August 10, 3-6 PM, Artist Talk and Opening Reception
"POEMS FORM/FROM THE SIX DIRECTIONS"
On Exhibit: August 10-September 15, 2002

A Visual Poetry Exhibition and Wedding Happening:

The Pusod Center is pleased to present an exhibit of poems, drawings,
sculptures and installations by Eileen Tabios "& the Universe." The
exhibition also features guest artists who collaborated with Ms. Tabios: V.C.
Igarta, Patricia Wood, Alice Brody, Paolo Javier, Jukka-Pekka Kervinen, Max
Gimblett, Thomas Fink and Cal Strobel.

The exhibition will open with various festivities on Saturday, August 10,
2002.  At 3 p.m., Eileen Tabios will present an artist's talk, followed by a
celebration of Ms. Tabios'  metaphorical (and real) marriage to "Mr/s Poetry"
through a wedding  performance "Happening."   Poet Oscar Penaranda will
"minister" the wedding, aided by poet Tony Robles acting as Mr/s Poetry's
"Best Man."  Poet Catalina Cariaga will play an instrument from her
collection of vintage ukeleles to provide music for the rite where audience
members will pin poems on the outfits of two brides: Ms. Tabios' original
wedding dress, worn in postmodern mode by poet Barbara Reyes, and the
original wedding dress of BWF/Pusod Founder Malou Babilonia worn by cultural
activist Dori Caminong.  Reception music will be provided by the dynamic
SPAMSILOG Band.

The Wedding Happening references a wedding tradition in Filipino and other
cultures of guests offering support by pinning monies on a newly-wed couple
during a dance.  In this Happening, poems will be pinned on the wedding
outfits to symbolize how Poetry, too, feeds the world.   Reflecting the Six
Directions concept of integrating the universe into a poem, poets from around
the world wrote and sent the poems that will be handed out to the audience
for pinning on the wedding outfits.

Further reflecting how Poetry feeds ("heals") the world, the Happening will
serve as a fundraiser for Pusod's activities to clean up the environment: a
private donor has agreed to match any dollars pinned by attendees onto the
wedding outfits.  See www.bwf.org for more information about BWF/Pusod's
activities to facilitate a better understanding of the economic, cultural and
ecological conditions that affect the world.

Six Directions: north, south, east, west, up and down.

TO BE RELEASED IN OCTOBER, 2002 FROM: SUBPRESS COLLECTIVE
a day in the life of p.
a novel by=20
kari edwards
an exploration of language, gender, and place.

From  Anne Waldman: Burroughsian, transgressive, exceedingly sharp and
witty,  kari edwards has launched a startling and entertaining first novel.
The "p" of the title is a visionary, agitator, bemused thinker, voyeur as
well as the penultimate protagonist afloat in a world of mixed signs,
genders, language, politics, irony.  What's solid? This picaresque book is
the dislocated yet substantive narration of the future.

From Kevin Killain: edwards=B9 book is side-splittingly funny, when it wants
to be, and tragic and mystic in turns from page to page. Like Marcel
Duchamp's Rrose Selavy, "p" gives a new twist to our received ideas of
heroism, kindness and lucidity.

From Dennis Cooper: To say kari edwards is a gifted, whip smart,
tremendously inventive writer isn't enough.  "a day in the Life of p." is
much more than just a uniquely graceful and thrilling novel; it reimagines
what it means to be an author from the soul outwards.  This is an event.

kari edwards is a poet, artist and gender activist, winner of New Langton
Art=B9s Bay Area Award in Literature(2002), author of a day in the life of p.
to be released by subpress collective (2002), a diary of lies - Belladonna

This is from the vice president of financial affairs of the University of
Hawai`i, not that that matters, except that he moved here from Cambridge,
MA.  He was steered toward relevant books (including Bamboo Ridge's _Growing
Up Local_) by Louisa Solano...anyway I told him there was some Grolier
criticism going on and he sent me this...Susan

what's most interesting to me about those #'s is that women comprise
maybe, what, 15% of the "top 100" (yes?---assuming i can tell from
the names)... also, the #'s don't account for length of posts (i
generally go on some when i post, whereas some in the "top 20" post,
as a rule, 2-3 liners)...

so though there's talk of the increasing gender equity of the
internet, fact is, on this list anyway, of those who post most often,
women are clearly underrepresented (i.e., in purely statistical
terms, as measured against the general population, as opposed, say,
to the population of poets)... i wonder how this 15% compares with
the number of women subbed to this list?...

also interesting is that one of the "top 2" (richard t) does not hail
from the u.s... given the stats we regularly receive on
subscribership by country, where u.s. subscribers comprise something
like 87% of the list community, this might be thought somewhat
remarkable...

best,

joe

Cuento Negro 3

The itinerant private dick pitched three shirts to the
ravenous East Wind.  Over in Timor, the man squinted
through a greasy monocle.  The chiaroscuric Lucky
Strike has breathed its last tomorrow.  What nobody
could figure out was how the body arranged itself in
that position; was the wind involved?  Did the dogs
growl singularly?

The clever man never asks why, only how.  Phantom
motivational speakers and captains of industry
cavorted in drag through the town square.  Eldridge
sucked on his pipe.  There must be a way to corner the
market on buttonfly boxers without upsetting the
delicate environmental balance.  Three fingers of
scotch may help solve the rebus.

And where are you going said backward to
forethought—to the badlands, baby, with a fluster of
birds and a misplaced ax handle.  Go tell it to the
molehill; this is getting fishier all the time.  The
basset hounds persisted in their lowing.  Hired men
were little more than chattel.  This is the third
chanson and the windows are still wet.

touch of earth on your still
almost unawake mind
the unknown space falling
on your eyes. There

thinking it all, is something
could be a rendezvous
with that same old dream
of life meaning that
you keep looking. And
roads all wide long- empty.

The Poetics Program at SUNY-Buffalo is delighted to announce that Myung Mi
Kim will be joining our Core Faculty this Fall. She joins Ming-Qian Ma, who
came to the faculty of the Poetics Program this  past Fall. More
information on the Poetics Program , which is part of the Department of
English, at http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics.

As a welcome to Buffalo, R. D. Pohl had written a good introduction to
Myung's work for the Buffalo News. Bob Pohl has a monthly poetry page in
the News, with articles, listings, and poems -- a very unusual, but very
welcome, feature for a daily newspaper.

No stranger to a strange land

Myung Mi Kim is joining the faculty at the University at Buffalo.

By R.D. POHL
Special to The News
8/4/2002


"I am the perpetual foreigner at the door of the demand to specify the
purpose of (my) talk (what is it good for?)," Myung Mi Kim told attendees
at a recent poetry conference, "how to evoke a poetics that does not
capitulate to terms sanctioned and policed by the prevailing, dominant
discourses invested in "the point of the talk.' It is not the certitude of
truth content, but it's permeations that attract, avulse and engender acts
of speaking. (This) talk, if in relation to the task of writing, cannot
proceed by argument; it proceeds by enactment - the something made and the
process of something being made."

This pointed comment at the outset of Kim's presentation indicates a great
deal about her work.

Among leading contemporary American poets, she may be the one most
committed to rendering what she has referred to as the "infinitesimally
divisible moment," as a unit of expression.

In her four collections of poetry, she has developed a brilliant, if
challenging, contrapuntal style consisting of phrases, images, sentence
fragments, snippets of dialogue and quotations from other texts drawn
together not so much by some sort of overarching narrative logic as by a
deeper emotional thematic closer, by way of analogy, to the way musical
composers are commonly believed to work.

Later this month, Kim will leave her Northern California home and teaching
position at San Francisco State University to join the faculty of the
University at Buffalo as the newest addition to the Poetics Program.

Despite her West Coast roots, she is no stranger to UB, having visited here
twice on residencies for the Poetics Program's Wednesdays at 4 Plus Series.

Born in 1957 in Seoul, South Korea, Kim came to the United States with her
family at age nine.

In "Under Flag," her award-winning first book of poems originally published
by Kelsey Street Press in 1991, she captured the confusing circumstances of
her upbringing in authoritarian Cold War era South Korea and the culture
shock of sudden total immersion into a new language, consumer society, and
the ideology of 1960s era America through the eyes of a pre-adolescent.

"Must it ring so true/ So we must sing it," she wrote in the fractured,
discontinuous yet oddly lyrical style that would come to define her work,
"The slide carousel's near burn-out and yet/ Flash and one more picture of
how we were meant to be."

Conversely, the volume's title poem worked by juxtaposing lists of military
equipment and fragmented descriptions of its usage with a child's
conception of borders and national identity.

The concepts of citizenship, gender, and process of naturalization were the
focus of another passage: "Who is mother tongue, who is father country?"
wrote Kim in what became the volume's most quoted line.

If many readers accepted the abstracted, non-narrative techniques of "Under
Flag" as perfectly suited to the material, Kim's continued refinement of
these strategies in her subsequent volumes met at least initially with some
resistance.

In her second volume, "Bounty," originally published in 1996 by Chax Press,
she explored a constellation of gender related themes including birth and
motherhood without resorting to the construction of a narrative subject (an
"I" or "she") to which all the disparate material she brought to the text
could cohere.

No doubt the omission was intentional and offered in some sense as a
critique of confessional poetry and other misuses of the ego in Western
literature, but it also suggested a distanced, almost clinical approach to
the material of intimate experience.

Kim's 1998 volume "Dura" (Sun & Moon Press) is a single, book-length poem
examining the legacy of Korean immigrant women in late 20th century
America. Reading through her work, one is reminded of what the late Donald
Barthelme said about his own minimalist short stories. "Fragments are the
only form I trust," he once told an interviewer.

Kim prefers the philosopher Adorno's more elaborate formulation: "The
fragment is that portion of the totality of the work that opposes totality."

The University of California Press published Kim's fourth collection of
poems, "Commons," earlier this year.

Like much of her earlier work, the poems in this volume are symphonic -
dealing in major and minor themes like agriculture and the development of
plant life right alongside various accounts of vivisection, polemics for
Third World debt relief and expositions on how various glyphs and phonemes
contribute to the act of speech.

The book's fifth and final section, "Pollen Fossil Record," consists of a
kind of appendix and amplification of Kim's current thinking about her work
and poetry in general.

In describing the scope of the current work, she writes: "COMMONS elides
multiple sites: reading and text making, discourses and disciplines,
documents and documenting. Fluctuating. Proceeding by fragment, by
increment. Through proposition, parataxis, contingency-approximating nerve,
line, song."

One of the functions of poetry, she concludes, is "to mobilize the notion
of our responsibility to one another in social space."

To this end, she sees "poets as agents for the most arduous, the most
dangerous cause there is: to love the other, even before being loved."

First, let me say that I am working on a review of
Waldner's new books and am curious as to other's ideas
regarding this question:

In Walnder's Dark Would, does anyone see Butler's
notion of gender as performative as a sort of link
between Heidegger's attempt to understand/define the
nature of a Thing and Dante's quest for the Beloved?
I mean the way Dante's quest, generally thought of as
an "act", is "thinged", while gender, generally
thought of as a "thing" is performed or "acted".

(Walner uses Dante & Heideggar as epigraphs for the
book)

I hope not.  For someone supposedly trying not to "capitulate to terms
sanctioned and policed by the prevailing, dominant discourses invested in
'the point of the talk,'" she sure doesn't veer much from the acadominant
discourse and outlook that's prevailed in English departments for twenty
years or more.

I don't really understand these sentiments. Which
English departments are you blanketly talking about?

I mean--I guess it's sort of dumb to start debating
about how much of an "outsider" or "insider" Kim is in
her poetry, it's alarming to me--unbelievable,
nearly--that one might read Kim's poetry and feel it
in line with "acadominant discourse"--

to me it is profoundly visceral, not a bit unpleasant
(in the way one prefers art to be), and beautifully
graspable/ungraspable.

i am pleased--pleased--that there exist a few
departments in this country that nurture, welcome, and
help to cultivate new and innovative work...poets who
are as radically different in style, technique,
approach, and poetics as, just for example, Robert
Creeley, Susan Howe, Myung Mi Kim, and Charles
Bernstein, might find themselves attached to the same
program...

but i am puzzled when you say this is an "acadominant"
discourse...dominant where?

I agree with Master Kazim Ali on this one!  Myung Mi Kim is an
interesting poet, and a great teacher, and she's very sharp, funny,
natural, the students at Buffalo will warm to her I'm sure, all
right, maybe she comes across a little stilted in this particular
press clipping, but maybe she was nervous!  And her remarks may have
been wrenched out of context, after all, someone inserted an
apostrophe into her word "its" which I'm sure she didn't put in
herself.  Give her a chance.  She doesn't need any defense from me,
that's for sure, but I, like many others here in San Francisco, am
sad that she's left us yet happy she's off to a place that I presume
she will find even more appreciation (and money too I expect) (at any
rate rents have got to be cheaper there LOL).  Myung Mi Kim is a
warm, honest, engaged woman with lots to offer to both readers and
students.  Go Buffalo!

We've been around this bush a few times on this list -- I won't get into a
critique of her quoted statement or arguments about her poetry today --

BUT


I would invite anybody (well, maybe anybody outside the Berkeley area) to enter
their nearest University Department of English today and poll the faculty to
see how many recognize the name of Myung Mi Kim,,,, show them some poems and
ask if they'd teach them

Going jibberish today?

"A set of random jibberish telling the cell how to evolve proteins"

"There is a wonderful story about Dr. Erickson and a schizrophreic patient who spoke only jibberish. For one year Dr. Erickson would listen to the patient talk and than go back to his office and close the door. Than one day, to everyone's surprise, Dr. Erickson walked up to the patient and began to talk to him in jibberish. He had been practicing for over a year behind his closed door to understand and speak the patients jibberish. The schizrophrenic patient stepped backwards, looked disoriented, and than blurted out in perfect english, "What did you say?". From that point on they spoke in english."

http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ousgg/ps/ps324/

Dear Sir,

Some members may recall an

email I sent to the group's

mailing list during the summer

vac. concerning the word

"gibberish". I feel that it is

worth repeating here for the

benefit of those who were not

members or were not paying

attention to their email at the

time.

Quite by accident as I was

moving house, I happened

upon the etymology of "gibber-ish".

It appears that gibberish

is named after a certain Mr

Geber, a scientist who wrote

down all his ideas in code so

that they would not be stolen.

They thus appeared to other

people as "Geberish".

Hence it would seem that the

correct spelling of the word is

"gibberish" and not, as the

Editor would have it,

"jibberish".

I trust that the editor will not

exchange the letters "g" and "j"

in this article for comic effect

(ha ha).

Yours, Mr D A Ball, ex-Keble

So it's supposed to be "geberish"

huh? Well, logically, since

"gibberish" requires alteration of

the original word by swapping a

vowel and adding a letter, I would

argue that it should be spelt

"jebberish". Ha ha.

Dear Sir,

I am angered by the

disgracefully low standard of

editing in recent editions of

PostScript. The words "Winter

Walking(TM)" have not been

rendered in the correct font

(Issue 322 pp6-7, Issue 323

pp1). I trust that this will be

rectified in the next issue.

Yours, Mr D A Ball (ex-Keble)

In fact, this was a deliberate facelift

for OUSGG's popular trip, which

has borne the same logo for five

years now, since I first introduced

it in 1995. It was felt that the new

logo brings the Winter Walking

brand smoothly into the twenty

first century.

Dear Sir,

I would like to complain about

the article "OUSGG: Alpha to

Omega" in issue 322 of this

esteemed publication. By using

the Greek alphabet, the author

has omitted the letter W. I fear

that this has led to the far more

important omission of Winter

Walking(TM) from the

glossary, which is not

something that can pass

unremarked upon.

For those who are not aware, I

quote a letter written by the

author himself and published

in issue 297: "Winter

Walking(TM) - Go to it if you

do nothing else... Go to it if you

do nothing else... Go to it if you

do nothing else..."

Mr D A Ball (ex Keble)I'd already started before I realised

that w wasn't Greek for w. Sorry.

I expose my students to everything, including langpo, vizpo, and golfpro.
This is fairly common, I think, in and around NYC.  Middle America might be a
different story.  There are, of course, Profs everywhere whose expertise is
not in Modern/Postmodern lit.  When they teach a general lit course, they
likely stick to the easy "contemporary" stuff or the tried and true ancients,
rather than wrestle with difficult work outside of their fields.  I've never
known a Victorian scholar, for example, to take a crack at Ashbery.  Doesn't
mean it doesn't happen.  A Tulane University professor (when I was a teaching
assistant there) once complained that I was "teaching pornography."  The book
in question was Naked Lunch.  However, the majority of Profs in the
department supported me and my problem disappeared.  So at the very least,
there are pockets of support everywhere, and lots of it, I imagine, on the
coasts.  I could be wrong, of course.  And Kim, I agree, is probably a
question mark in most English departments.  The few know of her; the
majority, their attentions elsewhere, might never know, or care.  Best, Bill

Yeah, it's an old bush, but I have a neurotic need to pop off once in a
while.  Note that I used my word, "acadominant," which has not gotten a set
public meaning, though I certainly know what I mean by
it--and it isn't what dominates all universities, but
what is dominant in the academically most prestigious universities.  What is
qualitatively dominant--as in what Modern Language seminars (or whatever
they are called) are dominated by.  In any discipline there's always a huge
middle that just plods along, vaguely familiar with what's going on at the
previous generation's cutting edge, which is generally what is acadominant,
similarly familiar with pre-Shakespearean literature, or the equivalent, and
almost entirely unfamiliar with the actual cutting edge of their time.

Ah, but show them her credentials, as those kind of people view them, and
I'll bet few would not invite her into their faculty.

Which is okay with me.  I'm just tired of people who seem to need to subvert
the language in opposition to some conspiracy that uses language to subjgate
us instead of writing poems--with the language that is everybody's tool, and
does have an objective communicable meaning, and is almost entirely
unpolitical, though able to be used for political purposes, the way Kim uses
it.

Reread my post.  It was about the acadominant prose spout of hers that was
quoted.  I said I hoped it did NOT indicate the kind of poetry she wrote.

Who are the innovative poets in that department?  I mean the ones using
techniques that were not in wide use thirty years ago?  Not that that's
necessarily what poets need to do to be valuable, but what they need to do
to be considered innovative, it seems to me.

MLA, if I have the initials right.  All university English departments,--see
my earlier post.  Most of these go their own outdated way but are cowed by
SUNY Buffalo, Berkeley, Stanford, Duke, etc., the way my present hometown,
Port Charlotte,
Florida, has poetry readings whose most advanced participants sometimes read
other poets like Merwin, and think of Bernstein's poetry
as advanced calculus to their arithmetic.  They,
mostly secretly, look down on it, but still accept it as the dominant
high-culture form of poetry.

Yep.  Most academics, like most people, just do their jobs, their

imagination is in play, anyway?  Not much.

Yeah, ditto Kevin et al.  I don't understand why
people are in a tizzy about this.  While yes,
certainly the majority of Eng depts across the country
have never heard of Kim, that's THEIR loss, and OUR
gain that programs like Buffalo exist where a
brilliant, interesting poet like her can be
appreciated.

But actually, I think that although many Eng depts are
not exactly well-versed in experimental poetics, this
does not mean they are opposed to same if same happens
to teach in the dept, or applies for an open position.
 I currently teach at a business school, for god's
sake, and I am sure not a single person in my rather
large dept has ever read Creeley, much less Kim, and
yet they hired me, with my photocopies of poems in
weird journals.  Because, let's face it, there is more
to teaching than personal poetry aesthetics.  And
there's more to the hiring process, too.

Nonetheless, I live in hopes that one day I will be
teaching at a school with colleagues like Susan Howe,
Bernstein, Creeley, and Kim.  What a dream.

All gung-ho about poetry,
Arielle

I think one is missing Bob's argument. He was referring to the passage quoted
in the post and not to the poetry, which he said he is not familar with and
may be great.

I am curious to find out who will defend the quality of the following
sentence as writing:
"It is not the certitude of truth content, but it's permeations that attract,
avulse and engender acts

of speaking." I am assuming that this is a correct quote and "permeations"
and "avulse" are not misprints. "Permutations that attract"? I am stumped
about "avulse." To me it sounds like a swamp creature.

What's actually happening in this discussion of Myung Mi Kim is the same
dopey negativity we hear about most things.  Why begrudge her a job at a
great program?  Because of one phrase in a newspaper interview? And it's OK
to be completely ignorant of her work, but mouth off about her anyway?

I am the perpetual foreigner at the door, I was right all along. of the
demand to specify the
purpose of (my) talk (what is it good for?), the beginning seemed right. the
beginning was where the swamp water seemed so sweet. Myung Mi Kim told
attendees at a recent poetry conference, "these caves in which we live are
determined prose." flight off hand while how to evoke a poetics that does
not capitulate to terms sanctioned and policed by the prevailing seems
moody, today. dominant discourses invested in "the point of the tractor". it
was the rainy season, after all. caves were dank and uncomfortable, and we
had to talk. It is not the certitude of truth content or billowing breeze,
as we ready to plant early crops, but it's permeations that attract,
spillage and doctrine in equal order. we are treated to avulse and engender
acts of speaking, or piling. (This) talk, if in relation to the task of
writing, cannot proceed by argument; it proceeds by enactment, the something
made and the process of something being made, and the cousin of the
something made walking around dazed, telling the filing system of roses so
wet and caves so dank, that this impossible rainy season must be suffered
while cornered language.

Thanks for this Jim, and for posting some of Kim's poems.  She was doubtless
hired for her poetry, not her press clippings.

A couple questions: how many Asian American (woman) writers are on this
list?  How many Asian American writers teach in programs like
SUNY-Buffalo's?

I mean, if we're talking power here (professional, poetic), let's just say
that almost of it still resides elsewhere than in the Asian American woman
writer.


aloha, Susan

2.  The sudden movement of soil from one property to another as a result of a flood or a shift in the course of a boundary stream.

...which might be another connotation.  Perhaps she's saying that content, as it's being encountered, moves through the interstitial fluid between truth and not-truth; and that those movements attract responses and rip apart our notions of truth, shifting our own idealogies creating a need to speak out to make sense of it.

Or, more simply (?): Ambiguity Rips.

I'd be interested in more responses to her work and why it works.  I think
this is an interesting direction rather than the sourgrapes approach to
POETICS and jockeying for place.  "Avulse" is a great word, in my book,
somewhat akin to "Poasis"  Open words like this - that bring more to the
body and soul than what's on the page - seem to be one of the things poetry
could be about?

permeations:  instances in which something is permeated by something else
avulse:  a neologism suggesting revulsion or a turning away.
my problem w/ the above is the "it's."  it could be a misprint for
"its," or it could be an "it is" like the one that started the
sentence.  however, even if it is a misprint, that is probably the
reporter's or copy-editor's doing and not Prof. Kim's.

Neither does it reside in white middle-aged working-class English poets from
Birmingham, Susan. I think a focus on 'power' in terms of poetry is
misplaced, prejudice exists at and on all levels, there are those who can
rise over it, and an art that flies above, I never became engaged with this
art for its social status side-effects, it is, quite 'literally', a labour
of love.

I like the association of professional and poetic - yer wot? An art that
pays next to nothing has a professional side? I think one of the serious
problems of contemporary English language poetry is the confusion of poetry
and academe, that is not to despise the academic, but there seems to be a
tangle somewhere.

David, hi,
I'm lured from lurking because I have to disagree with
you here. I have a kind of potted theory
(experientially based) that it's exactly because there
is so little to go around so many poets that issues of
power become foregrounded so intensely in a scene of
poetic literati.
And that scene (in western countries) is like a
microcosm of the rest of the place - so it follows
that non-white women may be involved in struggling
against dominant notions & behavioural power.
So I agree with Susan Schultz here.
You wrote:" I think a focus on 'power' in terms of
poetry is misplaced, prejudice exists at and on all
levels, there are those who can rise over it, and an
art that flies above, I never became engaged with
this art for its social status side-effects, it is,
quite 'literally', a labour of love."

All the best,
Pam

Hi again,

Plus - I don't believe that art transcends life.
Writing poetry's probably easier than or probably
preferable to,say, looking after a sick child (just an
example)..

Cheerio from Pam

Hi Pam

I think I'd agree with your theory in some respects, but my point is that
the foci of prejudice are multiple and various, generalities of statement do
not fit, it depends upon the social angle of wherever it is, there is a
standing joke from Northern Ireland ( I know a lot of Ulster people) wherein
a Sikh goes into a bar in Belfast, someone goes up to him and says'What are
you?' He replies 'I'm a Sikh'. 'Ah, but' it goes, 'are you a Protestant Sikh
or a Catholic?'.

OK David--let me put it this way, avoiding generalities:

Even given that:

    --there is no such thing as power in poetry

    --there is no connection in the United States between power and race

    --it's a haphazard fluke that there are so few poets doing what Myung Mi
Kim is doing and getting recognized for it (Cha and Lew come to mind as
other Korean-American poets who combined innovative strategies with Korean
and Asian American culture)

I would still maintain that it's a good thing she got this job, which has no
association to power--or, as some on this list might content--to poetry.

I simply wish her well in the snow.

aloha, Susan

I appreciate Jim Behrle's straight-forward approach here. In addition, I
think it's inaccurate to say that "prestigious," or "mainstream" academia is
filled with folks waving the flag of innovative poetries. In fact, many
English departments are sparsely populated with people studying poetry at
all--let alone that of the "innovative" variety.
And the Midwestern gal in me chafes at the idea that people on the coasts
are gettin' it (poetry that is) while "middle America" is not. It all
depends who has landed (and is teaching and writing) where (often due to
economic necessity) and what their interests are.
Good night,
Kathy Lou

It happens I'll be teaching a class on Zukofsky, Niedecker, Reznikoff, Oppen,
and Bunting this fall. Can anyone suggest some spoken word recordings
(commerical, web, bootleg, et al) that might be available. I have a few worn
tapes shared by friends in the past, but I'd be especially pleased if anyone
could direct me to a source for Niedecker, Reznikoff, or Oppen.

Please send any suggestions through the back channel (sherwood_k@utpb.edu).

Thanks

In reading the excerpt at:
http://www.sunmoon.com/lit_lives2/kim.html

...my response would be that like Derek R, I like it, too.  It works for me because it has a momentum to it that seems to come from its dance from being just a list of fancy nouns with their adjectives, to being prose that carries forward, to being an occassional subversion to my desire for simple meaning.

I especially like the 2nd to last stanza because of its feel of openness and what seems to be a quiet joy hidden "until it flowers".

And the last bit about starlings and duration, because starling is at once a bird and a pile of rocks used for support.  And that it's in the starling, the balance between flight and solidity, that we can know a bit more of the "knowledge of the universe".

As I mentioned a couple of months ago here, I began
listening to John Cage music--I've heard a lot of his
"prepared piano" music which sounds strange, but not
revolutionary, and a couple of truly wonderful and
bizzarre pieces like "ryoanji" and "the wonderful
widow of eighteen springs"

i'm looking for more of the latter--stranger and more
bizzarre but still musical, not necessarily
"noisy"--since there are endless cage albums (it
seems), i thought i'd ask for advice and
recommendations here...

the second part is: i'm interested in finding out more
about Alice Coltrane...does anyone have listening
suggestions there? or particularly where in CA her
ashram is, how I might contact those folks...i was
told her later recordings are not commercial available
except through the ashram...

 Hi Dave,

I'm lured from lurking too. Regarding your comments below:

> Dave wrote:" I think a focus on 'power' in terms of

> levels, there are those who can rise over it, and an

>

I don't think the fact that poetry's a 'labour of love' allows room for transcendence of those politics, or that this is even a possibility.

Since when are love and power unrelated?

There are also plenty of things to fight for beside social status, some of them worth fighting for. Maybe that's when art can really
fly above.

I really do think Jim Behrle is onto something important recently when he advocates a less negative approach.

Apart from anything else, this would help with the 'so little to go around' problem. More hope.

It's how you play the game that matters?

Hope that makes some sense!

Cheers,

Cassie

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

the character essays


The 1000 Character Classic (or 'essay,' depending on the translation) is a
Chinese work from the 6th century - Ellen Zweig and I are translating it.
It was used in the imperial exams; the first 80 characters formed the
basis of keno; and numerous classical texts are numbered by the charac-
ters. The 1000 characters never repeat; the text was one of the bases for
learning the language. The beginning is mythological, more or less; there
are also numerous (Confucian) maxims.

Texts (such as Genesis) dealing with originary moments often stress the
role of language; creation is catalyzed by the Word, Speech, Breath, and
so on. In the reduction of Genesis I worked on, each word in the first
half is used only once; the rest are eliminated. So the first half becomes
a construct of language itself, its political economy, eliminating
surplus. In the second half, the end of Genesis determines the fullness of
the language, and the beginning of the second half contains the elimina-
tions.

A text beginning with God's speech descends to, ascends out of, the proper
name, the only remainder of languages abstract skein.

Genesis had to be modified, eliminating the future punctuations, capital
letters, chapter and verse numbers; the result is transformed into enun-
ciation, pure speech exhausting itself in the first half, and descending
out of evanescence, God's silence, in the second.

Other texts were also used to arrive at the condensation of the Julu perl
scripts, the theoretical work I did on the abacus (which is an inverse, a
spread of quantity across a skein), and bones drawn from the recent modi-
fied markov chain pieces.

Two different programs were used; one involved a number of unix commands,
including awk, sed, tr, nl, etc., that transformed a text into a list of
duplications which could then be manually removed. The second was a perl
script; I asked Florian Cramer's help on this. I then modified the script
to a small extent. The perl script is a coherent filter creating an array
and comparing the elements, retaining only the first of any that were
equivalent.

Language can only be spoken once, or it can be spoken forever; there is no
intermediary here, and once and forever are not binaries. Speaking once
creates it in the form of rigid designators, description taut in its
relation to the substrate of the real. Speaking forever glides forever; it
is only with the greatest difficult that meaning is retained. Speaking
once is the fullness and repleteness of meaning, but meaning grounded in
unique enunciation, the fullness of the earth. Speaking forever is meaning
emptied, swollen and diffused in air, untethered, transfigured.

Language is never one nor the other, but creation is, and forever carries
death, just as once is choratic birth.

Whatever you miss, don't miss *Roaratorio: An Irish
Circus on Finnegans Wake*. It's on a single Wergo CD
or a double Mode CD, in the latter case along with
"Writing for the Second Time Through Finnegans Wake."

Another CD I'd suggest would be *Singing Through*
with Joan LaBarbara. That's on New Albion.

In addition to the couple of things others have already mentioned (&
let me reinforce the recommendation for Joan La Barbara's Singing
Through John Cage, which includes a wide range of pieces drawn from
Cage's long career), try the String Quartet (he has several works
composed for this instrumentation, but there's only one that's called
a String Quartet); Cheap Imitation (a piano solo structurally based
on a Satie piece, written for a Cunningham dance when it turned out
they couldn't get the rights for the Satie piece Cage had selected).
An album called Imaginary Landscapes documents a series from the
1940s into the 1950s that started out with works for prepared piano &
percussion and ended up with a piece for a dozen radios.

Past that, it may get into a question of your tolerance for "stranger
and more bizarre but still musical." I'd suggest trying some of the
later works that just have numbers for titles (these are the number
of performers in a given work), perhaps choosing among them based how
much you're interested in the particular instruments heard in a
particular piece. There's a good recording of the String Quartet by
the Arditti Quartet that's paired with a later work in this series
that might serve as a good start on the number pieces.

The recordings of various flavors of Europera are collages of vocal
and instrumental lines from a variety of operas in the European
tradition with some other odder elements.

There was a long article about her in a recent issue of the British
music magazine, the Wire, which made it seem as if much of her older
work was in the process of being re-issued in the coming year. There
may have been a contact address for recordins, I don't remember. If
you have trouble finding this through a library, let me know & I'll
dig try to it out of storage.

i recently picked up a recording of a cage piece called "thirteen" --
one of his last i think if not the last, for a small chamber ensemble,
that i think, like many of the so-called "number pieces" from his late
period, will be right up yr alley.

the alice coltrane CD catalog has been getting fleshed out over the past
few years. a number of impulse titles from the early 1970s (ptah the el
daoud, journey in satchidananda, universal consciousness) are in print.
also a label called sepia tone has recently reissued some warner
brothers recordings from the mid-1970s (transcendence, transfiguration).
tho if yr looking for a single CD sampler, the "priceless jazz"
budget-priced collection that GRP did has a decent selection from the
impulse years...

bests,

p.s. i also give morton feldman's last work, "for samuel beckett," a big
big thumbs-up!

As I mentioned a couple of months ago here, I began listening to John
Cage music--I've heard a lot of his "prepared piano" music which sounds
strange, but not revolutionary, and a couple of truly wonderful and
bizzarre pieces like "ryoanji" and "the wonderful widow of eighteen
springs"

i'm looking for more of the latter--stranger and more bizzarre but still
musical, not necessarily "noisy"--since there are endless cage albums
(it seems), i thought i'd ask for advice and recommendations here...

the second part is: i'm interested in finding out more about Alice
Coltrane...does anyone have listening suggestions there? or particularly
where in CA her ashram is, how I might contact those folks...i was
told her later recordings are not commercial available except through
the ashram...

A great disappointment about innovative poetries and its poets is the silly
resentments some express toward other innovative poets.  We ought to
celebrate poets like Myung Mi Kim getting a new job. Doesn't that open doors

announced--doesn't that present us with more opportunities to publish, and
not less? Other poets' triumphs ought to be met with gladness. This is a
tough enough gig, with little power or love to show.  Would it kill some on
this list to be kind and open to other's work?  I'd like to hear from the
silent majority, who may or may not be turned off by the tone of some

me glad I became a poet.  I've decided to be more vigilant when they don't.

Jim--Having been on the list for a very long time, I seem to have lost the
stamina most list-fracases require, but this is just to say that I
basically agree with you.  The ever-present bitterness is a great pity &
has  kept me on the verge of unsubscribing for oh, i dunno, at least
ten years i guess.  But the list is also full of wonderful things, like
the
terrific music recommendations coming thru right now & tho these
sometimes come thru more infrequently than one wld like i guess they keep m=
e going.
I guess i am a little uncomfortable with the suggestion below that some sor=
t of
"vigilance" is called for to make us all post things that make each other
"glad."  Skepticism and critique certainly have their place, and the
skepticism here is sometimes useful in the face of the often insidious
affirmations of the larger culture.  But that said, there's certainly room
for much more warmth and generosity than we habitually see here.  So I'm
glad you, and others, have spoken up on the matter, especially since
you're quite possibly right that there's a "silent majority" who wishes
things were different.

Jim---

Hey I appreciate your fellowship

I just want to make a point in support of I think Murat though

to me the issue was analogous to this:

remember circa '94 when Alanis Morisette came out
and a whole industry (or "sub-industry") was calling it "alternative" etc....
(not to single out A.M., for one could easily say that band Live, etc. etc
and all the commercial alternative stations that sprung up with billboards
that said "Honk If You Hate 'Freebird'" etc....)---

Well, I actually liked Alanis Morisette--but I saw it as good POP---
this is not a qualitative judgment, or if it might be, it's coming from
somebody who thinks that it's at least as hard to create a GOOD pop record
as it is to say create "Giant Steps" by Sir. John....

So, for me, I was not willing to dismiss BG's original "acadominant" remark
as mere resentment on his part, even though I wouldn't have come up with
that phrase myself. I may very well be called acadominat someday by someone
too....it's not necessarily a swear word, etc....

I don't know if this makes any sense to you, but it's not spoken out of
resentment...

Jim,

Where does the recent exchange have anything to do with resentment? On my
part I was reacting to what I thought was an atrocious piece of prose (many
others don't seem to think so, and that's fine). I don't think this list is a
cheer leading circle. Respect for the use of language and honesty in one's
reactions to, I think, is essential to a poet.

Re this whole debate:  it seems to me that the languges of "innovative
poetry" and that of "theory" (the latter refers to the until recently
'acadominent' version of criticism that derives mostly from structuralism/
poststructuralism) are in a complex relation to one another.  A piece of
prose written by a speaker of the former language may resemble a
specimen of the latter--but that dosen't mean that the sort of English
department that specializes in the latter discourse will have any
recognition of the former.

Indeed, I'd contend that it's precisely the departments that are generally
considered most prestigous in which an anti-theoretical, craft-based
paradigm of poetry exists.  My fellow grad students (Harvard, mid-90s)
were all conversant in theory, but none of them had any interest in
contemporary poetry, except those who wrote it--and those who wrote it
were for the most part the least theoretically inclined.....All of which
is just to begin to say that the relation between contemporary poetry and
the academy is complicated as hell and facile attacks on a tiny
specimen of language (as Jim B. has pointed out) don't seem very useful to
me...

i want to chime in here.  while i don't think everything should always be
nicy-nice, i like it when people argue about ideas rather than the
goodness, badness, alternativeness or straightness of particular poets or
even types of poetry.  for instance, the recent discussions about poetry
and/or poetics (nick piombino, murat n-n et al) was exemplary, i think, as
was the earlier thread about "content."  while the list is certainly a
viable form of social life, i like it when that social life organizes
itself around intellectual matters rather than who's in/who's out.  there
is a relationship between ideas and who's in or out, of course, but the
conversation is more interesting when cast in terms of the former rather
than the latter.

sorry abt the lack of agreement in the above sentence. i rarely proofread
my posts for grammatical correctness and so sometimes, when a sentence
starts out going in in one idrection and ends up differently, there are
traces of the previously intended construction.  here, for inst.  i was
going to say "discussions about poetry/poetics and "content" --- but i
forgot so ended up w/ a singular verb (was) instead of were.  scrutiny of
kim's prose has made me self-conscious.

Poems start with tiny specimens of language, tiny specimen by tiny
specimen... There is nothing facile about it.
To adapt Pound to this whole issue: prose should be wriiten at least as well
as well as poetry, by a poet.

Bob, you can come out from under the bed now.  Geez, one little mistake . . .
  Reminds me of my bus trip to New Orleans to attend acadedomic, uh,

I've got your back, Bob, though you surely don't this fool's help.  You go,

I think Jim Behrle shockingly underestimates what difficult work it is to be
effectively, wittily mean. (cf Hazlitt, "On the Pleasures of Hating" and
much of Ed Dorn's later work. Chamfort was good at it; it takes style.)

As for poetry and power, there's "An Unusual Accounting Treatment" from
*Hello La Jolla*:

We live in what is by definition
A slave society
And this would include
most of the spread
We've always lived down the roads
And have received or taken what we got.

Some of us have had a close practice
With the master
But whatever was gained there
would be only clearer
Certainly nothing more
And it will definitely be seen
By Kennicott's auditors
As of no consequence to the main facts.

But I would like to point to what I see as interesting in the latest
conversation. A previous post contained the following:

"the languges of 'innovative poetry' and that of 'theory' (. . . version of
criticism that derives mostly from structuralism/ poststructuralism) are in
a complex relation to one another.  A piece of prose written by a speaker of
the former language may resemble a specimen of the latter"

This rather shocking admission is, in fact, what Bob Grumman was expressing
weariness about in one of his early posts:

"I'm just tired of people who seem to need to subvert the language (in
opposition to some conspiracy that uses language to subjugate us) instead of
writing poems"

(parentheses added for clarity)

Position breeds power, and power is for wimps.  That goes not only for Myung
Mi Kim and her various critics and detractors, but for all forms of poetic
canon / fodder making.  It's a manager/managee scheme.  Although position
might be said to be "for everyone", wimps will always vie for hierarchy over
generative confusion; the more the mental gyrations through which each of
their personal situations can be made to "top out" as one among many
"correct" variations of the overall "wimp" theme, the better chance they
have at joining the delusion of such as participatory Group Effort.  One
might usefully be suspicious of anyone desiring of position within an
institutional framework; the more jealous, the better, as far making
conflict in this arena Self Evident.  Ladies and gentlemen, start your paper

Hi Pam

I'd definitely agree with you that looking after a sick child is more
onerous than writing poetry.


What I mean is that writing preserves the moments, we forget most of our
lives, but poetry can carry identity across the gaps of time, I can look
back at poems of mine and recall as if it 'was yesterday' the act of making,
although maybe all the circumstances surrounding have slipped into the
abyss.

I also 'forget' poems I have written and can be extremely surprised at
re-meeting them.

Best

Hi again,

Plus - I don't believe that art transcends life.
Writing poetry's probably easier than or probably
preferable to,say, looking after a sick child (just an
example)..

Many of us post poems to the list; others attempt, in their posts, to
advance some sort of poetic, and still others limit themselves to commenting
on those. But what would a listserv post that was *in itself* an attempt at
art look like? "a means of publication" say the guidelines (or used to so
say) . . . but publication of what?

I'm looking at a rectangular white box surrounded by a light blue border
with several icons -- an envelope, some sort of storage receptacle, as
person with a check mark next to him or her -- on top of that. As I type,
the white box gradually fills with black letters . . .

I'll leave the Cage question to others, as you've already found the
prepared piano pieces that I know. (Other than to suggest, maybe,
looking for recordings featuring Margaret Leng Tan (?), who is deep in
the Cage piano repertoire).

As for the Alice Coltrane stuff, I'll clip the info from the article
that appeared on her in the May issue of the Wire:

"_A Monastic Trio_, _Ptah, the El Daaoud_, _Journey in Satchidananda_
and a compilation, _Astral Meditations_, are available on Impulse!.
_Universal Consciousness_ is issued for the first time on CD on
Universal Jazz/LPR on 6 May. _Cosmic Music_, _World Galaxy_, and
_Infinity_ can be found on Impulse! Japan. _Eternity_. _Rada-Krsna Nama
Sankirtana_, _Transcendence_, and _Transfiguration_ have just been
released on Warner Bros. Masters. _Huntington Ashram Monastery_ and
_Lord of Lords_ have never appeared on CD. The John Coltrane Foundation
can be contacted at 21777 Ventura Blvd., Suite 253, Woodland Hills, CA,
91364, USA, tel 001 818 226 9991, www.johncoltrane.com."

The foundation website doesn't seem to have much more on Alice's music,
so a call or letter might be the way to go if you're looking for one of
the unreleased discs. Best of luck.

I had a couple of posts rejected by the list yesterday because I wasn't
aware of the (new?) policy against anyone's posting more than twice a day to
it.  So, here's a gathering of thoughts with, I hope, an essay of sorts on
the value of negativity to follow.

A.  Yes, nice that SUNY, Buffalo, is hiring a Chinese-American woman--but
what has it
done for Samoan-American women?!

B. Is it possible for someone to criticize another person on this list and
not be accused of
sour grapes?  And when will such accusers start trying to refute the critic
if they disagree
with him instead of impugning motives, which are IRRELEVANT.

C. In just what way did I "begrudge (Kim) a job at a great program?"  What I
did was criticize her use of acadominant bs in an interview.  And it IS okay
to be completely ignorant of her work and mouth off about her if it concerns
something she has said that one is not ignorant of.  Obviously, I was
mouthing off at Kim's acadominant bs more than at her, and at her only for
seeming to see herself as anti-establishment.

D. Which reminds me that I've come up with a good comeback to those arguing
that langpo, and prose like Kim's, are not acadominant because most English
departments teach older stuff.  Most physics departments teach Newtonian
physics with a little relativity and quantum theory thrown in.  They aren't
more committed to post-Einsteinian physics than English departments are to
post-Iowa poetry; does that mean post-Einsteinian physics is not acadominant
in American physics?

E.  Kim's poem seemed okay to me, although standardly jump-cut sensitive.
Can someone
tell me if it would be consider language poetry?  In my taxonomy, it would
be straight jump-cut poetry out of Pound/Eliot/Ashbery.  Which is NOT to
criticize it.

F.  I have NOTHING against that which is acadominant.  I only dislike the
way those in the acadominant poetry school of our time, language poetry,
pretend to be anti-establishment.  Oh, and I AM envious of the money, awards
and prestige some of those in that school garner.  I believe there are
first-rate poets in all schools of poetry, but--except for those in MY main
school, the pluraesthetic poetry school--the language poets are doing by far
the most interesting, if not always the best, work.  And people in both the
named schools are using devices from each other's schools--using them well.

G.  Does Kim's appointment open doors?  Well, it shut one to all who
competed with her for entrance through it--but no doubt it will help open
other doors to certain other poets.  Billy Collins's appointment as Poet
Laureate has and will, too.  It seems to me reasonable to celebrate the
advancements of those who do your kind of poetry and complain about the
advancements of those who do poetry you consider inferior.  Not that my
criticism of Kim's prose had to do with any of that.

Which brings me to:

                    The Value of Negativity

The idea that one should not be negative about other poets' work is moronic.
First of all, it is impossible not to be negative about other poets' work.
That's because you can't buy all poets' work, you can't praise all poets'
work or even pay attention to all poets' work--and, friends, there is
NOTHING more negative than ignoring a poet's work.

But it is extremely valuable to state publically what you don't like about
another poet's work, and why.  It helps lower one's derangement to let off
steam, for one thing.  More important, it helps the critic and poet think
about good/bad in poetry.  It exposes the poet to reality, to what at least
one other person really thinks about his work.  That has to be helpful if
he's not a jerk.  It will make him aware of flaws he can correct.  It will
make him
aware of qualities of his work he does not consider flaws but may seem flaws
to others, which will allow him to present his non-flaws more effectively,
or find ways to help others understand them as non-flaws better.  A good
back&forth can generate publicity, too, which might win the poet and/or the
critic a few new readers.  It can also help readers see through bad poetry
and demand better poetry.  It will invigorate the poetry scene as a whole,
too, by unvanillaing it.

This all holds, needless to say, for negativity directed at criticism, or
short prose texts
quoted by reporters.

Hi Cassie

yup, love and power do sleep close together, but I was thinking of 'power'
or 'status' in that 'managerial' sense Catherine Lasko so rightly identified
in her post on this list. Negativity is a problem, but bland acquiescence
doesn't help either.

I know these are not exactly profound thoughts, I'm more preoccupied with
where on earth I'm going to find another job again, and the prospect of a
flight to Aus ( I've never done that long a haul aloft before)

Best

Hi Dave,

I'm lured from lurking too. Regarding your comments below:

>

I don't think the fact that poetry's a 'labour of love' allows room for
transcendence of those politics, or that this is even a possibility.

Since when are love and power unrelated?

There are also plenty of things to fight for beside social status, some of
them worth fighting for. Maybe that's when art can really
fly above.

I really do think Jim Behrle is onto something important recently when he
advocates a less negative approach.

Apart from anything else, this would help with the 'so little to go around'
problem. More hope.

It's how you play the game that matters?

Hope that makes some sense!

Cheers,

Cassie

Kim's Under Flag was a book that really moved me...

as a way to tie these last few threads together, here
is a poem--written in response to her poem
"Demarcation"--which appeared in 580 Split #4:

urge to call


begin with the phrase "it's light outside"

with the window, the reshaping of water

to map the shoreline between finger & figure

to say there is so much loss in the current language

anchor-ripped coral or coral-ripped hull

adjacent, resolute, an idea preceding vocabulary

the inclination of a knee to bend or body to decay

one would question sleep as one would step

an image, angled--inverted in a spoon

the subject, suspect of syntax

one tests the wind with a finger

as a ship settles between the shoreline & the lines on

    a map
the terms, twinned to coax out meaning

the leakage of water through slats of wood

one must begin with the current, the word "cohere"

the child who says "the window shows it's time to get
     up"

 Hi Dave,

Thanks for your thoughts, profound or not ... I've been thinking of these topics all day (in between trying to quit smoking!). Enjoy Australia, hopefully it won't be too wintry.

Well, I don't know about "onerous" David.
Anyway - you describe poetry as having a function
rather like taking snapshots - and that's an aspect of
it. Kind of Wordsworthian isn't it ?
As for me, I "look back" on many poems I wrote and
either dimly or vividly recall but don't really know
or feel like that poet any more. Not that I'd deny any
of the poems' credibility - I guess I just like to
move along in poetry writing & reading as I seem to
move along as my life progresses (or, simply,
continues).
Here's to surprises.

this question assumes this listserv isnt already a stellar example of
collective creativity.  I always learn most when projects are allowed to
self-organize to flourish & decay on their own terms.  if we think about
entities such as sondheim, k johnson, gudding & henry, all controversial
in some way cuz they knaw on people's aesthetic underpinnings, they
shouldnt be reduced to the status of parasites on the organism.  for me
its always the endless mutability of this information broadcast which
feeds me, & I say that having been on the list, active, lurking, digest
for what seems like a LONG time.  Perhaps this is all easy for me to say
because I will always be an outsider in the "acadominant"
behaviorfactory, & not invested in that particular mindset of the
"art"...

actually the thing that makes me nervous about this list most lately is
the attention to grammatical & punctuational correctness.

Your grapes are sour, Bob.  You admit as much later in this e-mail. Your
motives are relevant.  And I do refute you.  Your attacks on Myung Mi Kim
are really boring.  You add nothing to the conversation here by defending
them--you are simply being a jerk.  I'm interested in your poems, but if it
came down to it I'd take Myung Mi Kim's over yours.

C'mon, Bob.  They are certainly anti-establishment, it's laughable to
suggest otherwise.  Isn't the fun of being avant-garde to be avant-garde?
Did you become a poet to become the most famous poet in the country?

You know what's moronic, Bob?  You are not talking about her work.  You are
talking about a paragraph from a speech that's quoted in the newspaper.  I'd
be interested to see the whole thing.  What I've actually written about on
this list is the endless whining.  Send something to this list that's
captivating.  Send a very interesting if negative review that's thoughtful
and provocative.  Why must I wade through your piss?

I'm sorry if my postings this week sound preachy and dumb.  I do think it's
important to think about: why must our conversations with each other be so
vile?

but it does have to do with rigour (friendly or not), hence the limited
credibility I put on his other statements....

Hi Nick & Murat,

I'm too lazy right now to look up the reference, but I believe what Pound
said is that poetry should be at least as well written as prose-- not the
other way round, as Murat has it.

I appreciate Murat's "specimen by specimen" analogy as an example of poetic
process, but it doesn't persuade in this case.  In part, this is because
we're not making a poem here, but talking about whether it's fair to jump on
a good poet over an awkward remark that was quoted (or misquoted) in a
newspaper.  The real question isn't the quality of this sentence of Kim's,
but why it matters to anyone.  Let's be honest-- if Kim hadn't gotten the
job at Buffalo and the same passage had been posted to the list, I doubt
that any of us would be talking about it.  I agree with Kevin & Jim that
it's a GOOD thing that an interesting poet got hired to teach in an
interesting program.  What on earth is wrong with that?

As for "acadominant"-- let's look at ~this~ bit of language for a second.
Dominant to WHOM?  What real power is being wielded?  Who really cares?  If
you don't like Kim's (or Bernstein's, or Howe's, or Creeley's) work, don't
read it.  Nobody's forcing you.

Crankily putting in my two cents--

Mark DuCharme

elist publication.  I've realized that posting to the list has some
advantages over sending quips and poems and poetic staements to a place (or
site) for publication.  However, it does have disadvantages, probably the
most obvious being that there is no editor here so what i send isn't
censored for good or bad and in a sense I am what I post.

which brings us to topic #3.
this is not directed at anyone in particular, but I would like to see more
attention to positive and constructive posts.  I'm capable of doing my own
filtering of overpostings and negative attacks (by the way, one can set up
filters to bury posts you don't want) but I'd welcome some pointers toward
winnowing out the good stuff.  I don't want to turn this into a 'popularity'
contest, but I do find myself always reading Nick's posts and there have
been several interesting thoughts from others in the past.

I'm curious what people think about the role of ambition in innovative
poetries.  It seems to me to be a very harmful force.  Can it have a
positive side?  Does it makes us work harder, to strive to be better poets?
My ambition was simply to be a poet and be accepted by poets.  Also to sleep
with poets.  Or is careerism that's the problem?  What's the difference?  I
am wondering aloud, or, rather, quietly typing.  I think fame and fortune
prohibits poets from writing innovatively, and for the most part, writing
well at all.  How famous can poets really become?

Hi Mark,

I was reversing Pound's quote. Pound said that poetry should be as well
written as prose, implying that a lot of the the English poetry of his time
(Edwardian I suppose) was too vague, feely feely, pseudo poetic and deep.
Therefore poetry should be wriiten as well as prose (as directly and cleanly,
as in his imagist poetry).


In Kim's passage I see a similar kind of vagueness, which many in the list
may see as richness or innovation. Let's get back to the quote:

 "It is not the certitude of
truth content, but it's permeations that attract, avulse and engender acts
of speaking. (This) talk, if in relation to the task of writing, cannot
proceed by argument; it proceeds by enactment - the something made and the
process of something being made."

As far as I can understand, this passage is saying that it's not a
"an argument" but an "enactment," "a process." In other words, it is not mere
"talk" but a poem. This passage is claiming to function as a poem. Therefore,
attacking one's criticism of it as nitpicking, or defending Kim because she
was nervous, is irrelevent, worse, condescending to Kim.

The second part of Kim's quote is very direct and clear:

"(This) talk, if in relation to the task of writing, cannot
proceed by argument; it proceeds by enactment - the something made and the
process of something being made."

My question is, what the previous, by now notorious, part of the passage add
to it?
""It is not the certitude of
truth content, but it's permeations that attract, avulse and engender acts
of speaking."

My claim is that it adds very little, except an aura of jargon, of depth. In
my opinion Pound would have taken it out.

Murat

I think of Williams telling Stevens to change some lines in that worm poem:
"For God's sake yield to me, become great and famous!" [quoting from
memory--sorry if not quite right]

Interesting question, because it often gets conflated, I think, with the
issue of the lyric ego or "I."  Is this the same problem?  Not quite,
certainly, but equally certainly the two problems intersect.

My gut suspicion, is that, yes, as obnoxious as it is, ambition is a force
for creativity and conducive to "greatness."  Tho in one way, any evidence
to support this claim would be somewhat circular, since those poets who hav=
e
left their skid marks on the drag strip of the canon are very often those
who have lobbied most vigorously to get there, and the question is then: di=
d
they "get there" because they were great or are they "great" because they
got there?

I like poems where I get a strong sense of the author's strong (ambitious?)
personality.  VOICE!  *Gasp*!  Of course, I have a loose definition of
voice: I see this quality, for instance, in work by poets who are often
identified with "anti-voice" poetics:  Grenier, obviously; Bernstein,
Andrews, Hejinian, Scalapino, Silliman, etc.  In fact, I see it more in
these poets than in some of the "voice poets" these poets were initially
rebelling against.

Another circularity: does fame & fortune really militate against innovation=
,
or does it just seem this way because relatively few innovative poets (or
poets, period) have ever become rich and famous?  Are there clear historica=
l
cases of poets who have "sold out" when they "made it"?  Or is the
perception generally a result of sour grapes?

Who are the ambitious innov. poets out there?  More circularity: are the
ones who seem ambitious really more ambitious than all the others, or are
they just more successful because more readers / editors have liked their
work, or is what we refer to as "ambition" equally accurately referred to a=
s
"hard work"?  I think the "acadominance" resentment enters here as well ...
any innopoet [neologism alert] who lands a secure academic position has
generally been writing a lot of theory as well as poetry, and (amazingly!)
there is a lot of distaste for criticism / theory *on principle* in the
experimental "community."

Jim, I wonder whether the thing we ought to object to is really ambition pe=
r
se, as opposed to mercenary cynicism, blatant pandering, and / or just plai=
n
rudeness.  Which seems to be what generated this thread in the first
place....

So when is commentary "rude" as opposed to legitimately critical?  Well, I
didn't really want to get sucked into the whole Kim fracas, but just as a
preliminary gesture toward venturing a definition, I'd say that comments
about Kim's use of what could be perceived as jargony cliches would be
perfectly acceptable.  I would also say that, in this particular case, they
were easily dismissed; several list members have demonstrated the
significatory (real word?) validity of Kim's vocabulary, and in general I
think some people are overly eager to jump on crit-speak without taking tim=
e
to ask whether it might ever actually be a legitimate discourse, much like
poetry itself, for expressing complex thoughts in new ways.  Not that it
can't also just be pretentious and bad: too often, it is.

But back to Kim: the objectionable moment occurs when her brief, barely
contextualized comments are adduced to a larger insinuation that she is "no=
t
really innovative" or somehow a phony, a tool of the system, etc.  As other=
s
have remarked, the only thing that could possibly count as evidence toward =
a
claim like this would be the poetry itself (or, taking things to absurd
levels, a revelation that she actually rips her poetry off of undergrads, o=
r
sits at her desk chuckling "those pathetic suckers, my readers!" as she
types, etc.).

I have to admit, I've had a difficult time warming up to Kim's poetry
myself.  There's a coldness and blank "prettiness" and lack of tonal
variation that I just can't get behind, at least in what I've read so far.
It's like, *not ambitious enough* or something....  But this is purely
personal preference, and I would never argue on the basis of this perceptio=
n
that she is not "the real thing" or whatever.  Many people whose opinions
and aesthetics I respect are profoundly moved by her work.

This has turned into one of my typical thesis-free posts.  As good a place
to end as any.

If memory serves (an iffy if...) EP had reversed Flaubert's quote, who had
demanded that prose be as well written as poetry.

Hi Cassie

As for quitting smoking, don't I know about it, the more I try the worse I
get.

there are some odd things going on with this list, apart from the new 2
messages a day rule, I notice that now messages done as reply to sender
address to the sender only, not the list, while incoming messages have a
different address title from outgoing. Veird! (Typo deliberate)

Now Australian ideas of winter - they equal Brit notions of pleasant days in
spring! It's the height of summer here, which means that any time you go out
of doors you are likely to be drenched to the skin. Rather like the rest of
the year, except that it stays light longer.

Best

Subject:      Announcing: The Miseries of Poetry
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Announcing: The Miseries of Poetry: Versions from the Greek,
translated by Alexandra Papaditsas (1960-2002) and Kent
Johnson. Vestibulum [spora tradere], by Slavoj Zizek;
Preface, by Kent Johnson; Introduction, by Alexandra
Papaditsas. Nineteen translations. 30+ pages. $6. Available fall,
2002. First 25 copies, B through Z, signed by Kent Johnson.
Advance signed copies ordered directly through the publisher:
Skanky Possum Press * 2925 Higgins Street * Austin, TX
78722

*

In this remarkable work by Alexandra Papaditsas and Kent
Johnson, something very strange does happen: Antiquity is
brought into the present in a manner analogous to how the
Cameroonian stink ant (Megaloponera miserabilis foetens)
brings forth new life. Let me explain...

-from the Vestibulum, by Slavoj Zizek

We have all always desired the eyeless goddess, the handsome
whore-boy, the Megala Louloudia.  Here they are.  Ever since the
cache was discovered at Montazah Palace, we’ve been waiting for
translations suitable for Greek menus everywhere.  Had the Greeks
invented fortune cookies, they could not have foretold the strange
beauty of these versions.

-Eleni Sikelianos


I'm doubled over by the Miseries of Poetry, folded into a mirror
world of literature and here live on moth-ambrosia, play happily
with possible ancillas of the Pre-Socratics. --

-Garrett Kalleberg


Like the Jews, if Kent Johnson didn't exist, someone would have to
invent him. His mind leaks nomads constantly naming world-
historic hinges as if inscription were always underfoot. You can't
pull Catullus out of the 'incubated / god, writing himself into being'
but you can pull the door open. Literature is close to fraud,
evanescent and trembling in these times of incipient terror.
Johnson's approach deconstructs and exacerbates that fraud; I
think of his work as returning to the (re)creation of language -
political and sexual language, the languages of the last people
speaking on earth.

-Alan Sondheim


If they ever need a Classics Geek on "Beat the Geeks," Dr. Kent
Johnson is their man. The Miseries of Poetry is an operatically
nerdy intervention in the transmission of ancient lyric, a scurrilous,
fantastical, erudite, shameless, and often very moving addition to
the Geek--er, Greek--Anthology. More faithful in its peregrinate
Sapphic incontinence than most of the last two centuries of vanilla-
flavored translations, this sheaf of cracked-amphora smut will
change the way people misinterpret Linear B forever.  Roll over,
Richmond Lattimore: this is not your father's Mimnermus.

-Kasey Silem Mohammad


In the realm of ethics the ends rarely justify the means; in the
realm of art they always do. This complex translation by
Alexandra Papaditsas and Kent Johnson is flamboyant,
provocative, and brilliant. In three or four thousand years, when
English has long sounded more Asian than European, The
Miseries of Poetry will no doubt be inciting tremendous passions
at the KGB Bar.

-David Lehman


..still...moisture on the long
papyrus fragments, vivid
charm and cultural
codes transposed
on a spit the
tang of the Johnson mystagogus,
with live voice on quitch-grass
carnal and refined,
the then swag of buddhistic
pomegranites, the bull-leapers..

-Lissa Wolsak


In The Miseries of Poetry, which court(s) opprobrium as a slanted
form of cultural capital, violent mannerism is at war with erudite
imagination. Neither wins. Read it to behold their struggle and
moments of startling poetry.

-Nada Gordon


A pair of fabled translators politely ambushes us with a rich and
randy trove of ancient papyri with a dicey provenance. Here the real
is imbedded in the unreal, the imaginary in the factual. Lacunae
appear where there were none, and credible texts, adeptly
contemporized, where there were holes. The holes themselves are
deliciously elaborated. Once the reader is urged to fall, "Fall,
orangely, to the ground" resistance, in a single adverb, is dispelled.


-C.D. Wright


When Frank, Kenneth, Jimmy and I were young, the idea of forgery
was a kind of coal to make us go very fast: We shoveled it,
hungrily, into the bellowing fire, and the speed of our engine
became often quite fantastic. There were no rules in that magical
land; the backs of our chairs were turned against the sun, and
sometimes we would get this overwhelming feeling of exaltation.
Now, suddenly, we are here at this station, and one wonders,
frankly, what has happened. "Avant-garde" poetry, whatever it is,
like Amtrak rail travel, so clickety- clack, so predictable and slow...
May I suggest that Alexandra Papaditsas be canonized as a saint
of translation, and the cast of her horned head placed like a
warning above the door of The Academy of American Poets.

-John Ashbery


What a strange debt of gratitude we owe to Kent Johnson and his
co-translator, the perpetually-betrayed and haplessly goat-horned
Alexandra Papaditsas (now deceased). In The Miseries of Poetry
they bring us versions from the Greek that are at once bafflingly
poignant, shriekingly funny, and far lovelier than they have any right
to be, especially in light of their vexed provenance. These are
poems full of mystery and buggery, flying in from an unmapped
world on thin gold wings.

-Rachel Loden


Kent Johnson's Miseries probes our own relation with ancient
Greek musicks, which for most of us are only ever received through
"translation." In so doing, he celebrates and tweaks the
permeability of that membrane we call "self" or "author-ity." Who is
alive and who is not, now? Are you alive, reader? The arguments
and skirmishes of a translator are, perhaps, "the miseries of
poetry." And, in this, though translation might be always a "weird
extrinsic appendage," we like it, we crave it, for it's also "love's
ultimate excrescence into joy."

-Erin Moure

As Ever: Selected Poems by Joanne Kyger. Edited by Michael Rothenberg. =
Introduction by David Meltzer. 320 pages., Penguin Poets. ISBN: =
0-14-200112-0.

Joanne Kyger has played a vital role in the American poetry scene for =
more than four decades, and has been associated with nearly every =
innovative poetry tendency during that time, from the San Francisco =
Renaissance and the Beats to the postmodern movements of today. This =
definitive collection of her work reveals her as one of the major =
experimenters, hybridizers, and visionaries of poetry. Kyger is very =
much a poet of place, with a truly strong voice-delicate, graceful, and =
never wasteful; her poems explore themes of friendship, love, community, =
and morality, and draw on Native American sources as well as the path of =
Buddhist religion and philosophy. Kyger's love for poetry manifests =
itself in a grander scheme of consciousness-expansion and lesson, but =
always in the realm of every day. Edited with a foreword by Michael =
Rothenberg, and with an introduction by poet David Meltzer, this book is =
a marvelous overview of a wonderfully challenging and important poet.

"Joanne Kyger's poems: musing, sharp-edged, generous. Striking how she =
can take the most ordinary moment-to-moment-and ground it in depths we =
all share; then move out to the mystical and devotional and resolve in =
the magically plain. A superb poetic sensibility effortlessly playing =
like the shadows passing on a far mountain range: and yet so intimate!" =
-Gary Snyder

"A major collection by the legendary figure and muse whose exemplary =
writing reflets her discerning Buddhist sensibilty."-- Anne Waldman

"Joanne Kyger's poetry is a continuous demonstration of true FREEDOM, on =
all levels of the world's phenomenal and spiritual realms. Her poems, of =
any that I know, come the closest to being actual beings-beings endowed =
with a genuine materiality of thought, feeling, language and humor. They =
make one glad to be alive." -Anselm Hollo

"If existence is just what happens, can poetry rise to the occasion? =
Joanne Kyger's poetry is of existence as it happens, moving within =
earshot, and close-up, under her sharply critical, wildly affectionate =
glance. It is Kyger's peculiar sorcery to force the issue: a wave of her =
wand brings actuality into focus, shimmering in syllables newly =
familiar, momentous, and true." -Bill Berkson

"Joanne Kyger's great body of poetry continues to amaze . . . One of the =
most needed books in American poetry today.-Michael McClure

Wonderful to see this book arrive . . . Joanne will be reading at
Bumbershoot, Seattle's annual literary and musical arts festival, on Labor
Day Weekend (Saturday and Monday), so if anyone happens to be traveling
through the Northwest at that time, he or she should stop in and check out
one of our national treasures.

(And if you do, back-channel me, so I can invite you to the party for her as
well!)

Reply to a different post from Jim Behrle: yes, in my rush I misremembered
Susan Schultz as saying Kim was Chinese.  I gather she is Korean?  If so, my
friend in LA, Sang Kim, will probably be mad at me.

Now to a longer post by Jim Behrle.

So what?  And in this case, I don't admit to sour grapes.  I admitted to
sour grapes about the prestige, grants, publication, etc., certain
acadominant poets get, yes--but not about Kim's
getting the position she got.  Come to think of it, maybe I should have,
though I do like my present position as high school substitute teacher.

> Your motives are relevant.  And I do refute you.  Your attacks on Myung Mi
Kim are really boring.  You add nothing to the conversation here by
defending them--you are simply being a jerk.  I'm interested in your poems,
but if it came down to it I'd take Myung Mi Kim's over yours.

I am sincerely glad to hear that.

Mere assertion.  But I do agree that they are
anti-SOME-establishment.

>Isn't the fun of being avant-garde to be avant-garde?

Not sure of the point of this and the next question, but . . .

I think an important fun of doing poetry is discovering things to do that
are new to you.  It's
pleasant to find out that some of them may be new to everyone, but that's
not THE fun, for me, of doing
poetry.  And I do poetry, I don't do avant-gardry.

> Did you become a poet to become the most famous poet in the country?

Why I became a poet is too complex for me to answer quickly, but a main
reason was to make
beautiful word-objects, with or without other ingredients.  I wanted and
want to be of consequence, sure.  Fame is something else.  I do want to be
well-enough-known for my work to be discussed and I thus educated about it.
I would not much like to be the most famous poet in the country because I
would assume I wasn't very good.  It would probably be a distraction, too.

What does that have to do with the sentence you are replying to?  And why
should I talk about her work?  Why can't I choose what I want to talk about?
And why did you snip what I said about the value of negativity?

That's right.

Take out the "the" in your sentence above and
you've got it.  I stated, I did not whine.

Why must I wade through your piss?

You got me.  Now tell me why I should do what you want me to do.

A better question would be why you are such a
tender little bunny boy.  You can have the last word.
I'm through now.

Hi Pam

it is interesting about continuities/ disconcontinuities in poetry/ writing.
I always feel there is a consistency there, but that's it's not necessarily
apprehensible to the conscious mind, to surface recollection.

As it were, a record is playing, but the I or Thou that is its social
representative isn't fully aware of who the producer is.

Or why the recording was made.


Best

Well, I don't know about "onerous" David.
Anyway - you describe poetry as having a function
rather like taking snapshots - and that's an aspect of
it. Kind of Wordsworthian isn't it ?
As for me, I "look back" on many poems I wrote and
either dimly or vividly recall but don't really know
or feel like that poet any more. Not that I'd deny any
of the poems' credibility - I guess I just like to
move along in poetry writing & reading as I seem to
move along as my life progresses (or, simply,
continues).
Here's to surprises.

Hugely famous, and rich.  But that, of course, is reserved for the few.
Think Nobel, Pulitzer, Booker, etc.  Think Eliot, Neruda, Ginsberg, etc.  As
for ambition, isn't that a personality issue?  Neurosis and all that?  Some
dentists are very ambitious, some aren't, etc.  Same for poets.  Some have a
bigger void to fill than do others.  Nobody was more ambitious than Ginsberg,
and he managed to do some good work.  Ambition can get in the way, I guess,
but so can other things.  There's no direct relation between it and the
quality of the work that I can see.  Best, Bill

Announcing: The Miseries of Poetry: Versions from the Greek,
translated by Alexandra Papaditsas (1960-2002) and Kent
Johnson. Vestibulum [spora tradere], by Slavoj Zizek;
Preface, by Kent Johnson; Introduction, by Alexandra
Papaditsas. Nineteen translations. 30+ pages. $6. Available fall,
2002. First 25 copies, B through Z, signed by Kent Johnson.
Advance signed copies ordered directly through the publisher:
Skanky Possum Press * 2925 Higgins Street * Austin, TX
78722

*

In this remarkable work by Alexandra Papaditsas and Kent
Johnson, something very strange does happen: Antiquity is
brought into the present in a manner analogous to how the
Cameroonian stink ant (Megaloponera miserabilis foetens)
brings forth new life. Let me explain...

-from the Vestibulum, by Slavoj Zizek

We have all always desired the eyeless goddess, the handsome
whore-boy, the Megala Louloudia.  Here they are.  Ever since the
cache was discovered at Montazah Palace, we’ve been waiting for
translations suitable for Greek menus everywhere.  Had the Greeks
invented fortune cookies, they could not have foretold the strange
beauty of these versions.

-Eleni Sikelianos


I'm doubled over by the Miseries of Poetry, folded into a mirror
world of literature and here live on moth-ambrosia, play happily
with possible ancillas of the Pre-Socratics. --

-Garrett Kalleberg


Like the Jews, if Kent Johnson didn't exist, someone would have to
invent him. His mind leaks nomads constantly naming world-
historic hinges as if inscription were always underfoot. You can't
pull Catullus out of the 'incubated / god, writing himself into being'
but you can pull the door open. Literature is close to fraud,
evanescent and trembling in these times of incipient terror.
Johnson's approach deconstructs and exacerbates that fraud; I
think of his work as returning to the (re)creation of language -
political and sexual language, the languages of the last people
speaking on earth.

-Alan Sondheim


If they ever need a Classics Geek on "Beat the Geeks," Dr. Kent
Johnson is their man. The Miseries of Poetry is an operatically
nerdy intervention in the transmission of ancient lyric, a scurrilous,
fantastical, erudite, shameless, and often very moving addition to
the Geek--er, Greek--Anthology. More faithful in its peregrinate
Sapphic incontinence than most of the last two centuries of vanilla-
flavored translations, this sheaf of cracked-amphora smut will
change the way people misinterpret Linear B forever.  Roll over,
Richmond Lattimore: this is not your father's Mimnermus.

-Kasey Silem Mohammad


In the realm of ethics the ends rarely justify the means; in the
realm of art they always do. This complex translation by
Alexandra Papaditsas and Kent Johnson is flamboyant,
provocative, and brilliant. In three or four thousand years, when
English has long sounded more Asian than European, The
Miseries of Poetry will no doubt be inciting tremendous passions
at the KGB Bar.

-David Lehman


..still...moisture on the long
papyrus fragments, vivid
charm and cultural
codes transposed
on a spit the
tang of the Johnson mystagogus,
with live voice on quitch-grass
carnal and refined,
the then swag of buddhistic
pomegranites, the bull-leapers..

-Lissa Wolsak


In The Miseries of Poetry, which court(s) opprobrium as a slanted
form of cultural capital, violent mannerism is at war with erudite
imagination. Neither wins. Read it to behold their struggle and
moments of startling poetry.

-Nada Gordon


A pair of fabled translators politely ambushes us with a rich and
randy trove of ancient papyri with a dicey provenance. Here the real
is imbedded in the unreal, the imaginary in the factual. Lacunae
appear where there were none, and credible texts, adeptly
contemporized, where there were holes. The holes themselves are
deliciously elaborated. Once the reader is urged to fall, "Fall,
orangely, to the ground" resistance, in a single adverb, is dispelled.


-C.D. Wright


When Frank, Kenneth, Jimmy and I were young, the idea of forgery
was a kind of coal to make us go very fast: We shoveled it,
hungrily, into the bellowing fire, and the speed of our engine
became often quite fantastic. There were no rules in that magical
land; the backs of our chairs were turned against the sun, and
sometimes we would get this overwhelming feeling of exaltation.
Now, suddenly, we are here at this station, and one wonders,
frankly, what has happened. "Avant-garde" poetry, whatever it is,
like Amtrak rail travel, so clickety- clack, so predictable and slow...
May I suggest that Alexandra Papaditsas be canonized as a saint
of translation, and the cast of her horned head placed like a
warning above the door of The Academy of American Poets.

-John Ashbery


What a strange debt of gratitude we owe to Kent Johnson and his
co-translator, the perpetually-betrayed and haplessly goat-horned
Alexandra Papaditsas (now deceased). In The Miseries of Poetry
they bring us versions from the Greek that are at once bafflingly
poignant, shriekingly funny, and far lovelier than they have any right
to be, especially in light of their vexed provenance. These are
poems full of mystery and buggery, flying in from an unmapped
world on thin gold wings.

-Rachel Loden


Kent Johnson's Miseries probes our own relation with ancient
Greek musicks, which for most of us are only ever received through
"translation." In so doing, he celebrates and tweaks the
permeability of that membrane we call "self" or "author-ity." Who is
alive and who is not, now? Are you alive, reader? The arguments
and skirmishes of a translator are, perhaps, "the miseries of
poetry." And, in this, though translation might be always a "weird
extrinsic appendage," we like it, we crave it, for it's also "love's
ultimate excrescence into joy."

-Erin Moure

 Hello Dave & Pam,


Forgive my ignorance but what does the Muddy Waters reference mean?

Regarding the analogy below, and jokingly:

The producer would be the much-maligned self, and the record changes each time it replays and has no predetermined ending?

Now I have images of a new, post-Freudian, tiered analysis of the psyche:

Producer
Artist
DeeJay

But isn't everybody ambitious in some way?  I checked on of my dictionaries
and it did give as its first definition of the word, "ambition," "an ardent
desire for rank, fame or power."  Its second definition is "desire to
achieve a particular end," which to me is the proper definition of the word.
Yes, I believe in proper definitions, which not infrequently have little to
do with the way a word is most commonly used.  I made up the word,
"statooznikry" for ardent desire for rank, fame or power--or being a
"statooznik."  I agree with Bill that it needn't keep someone from becoming
a good poet.  It can spur him on to do his best--although it can also spur
him on to do his most crowd-pleasing.

Note: when I got Kim's ethnic identity wrong, the blunder was a
triviality--although my long friendship with Sang Kim and knowledge that
"Kim" is a very common Korean surname should have prevented it.  However, I
have to admit to a far worse blunder here: it was in being sarcastic about
Susan Schultz's call for the hiring of more women like Kim whose ethnic
group is ORIENTAL (as I now remember she said), not of women who are
Chinese-American,  as I misread her (due to the same kind of political
readiness to jump that characterizes many who criticized my first post about
Kim, I have to ruefully admit).  Being concerned that not enough women whose
ethnic group is Oriental are hired is reasonable enough for anyone believing
in affirmative action (though I mostly don't); being concerned that too few
Chinese-American women are hired makes less sense because there aren't that
many of them around (as far as I know).  And that, I hope, is it for me on
the political correctness front.

Being a poet is foremost an activity subsequent only to the continuous
objectification of "a life" that by the nature of its transference cannot
"belong" to anyone, but refers like a motherfucker to no one but.  Presuming
this itself to constitute "a ravishment", taking sides from which to fire
contradistinct feelings seems a situation mostly unimagined, in which far
too much Reality is presumed for the sake of an trumped assumption.  To the
extent that poiesis as ravishment is High Church, it is a nominal
arrangement in which anything said is a seat of Grave Ambition, things being
revealed completely as they occur.  We're all as "right" as the creases in a
smart new shirt.  They never last, especially in the heat.  Shall we admit
that throwing screaming streaks of shit at one another tops out as simple
fun?  Disagreement is unarguable, happily enough, as long as it, like all
forms of joy, aren't allowed to rise to the level of a game.  In poetic
terms, no one wins, because no one's "there" to claim anything resembling
victory, although victory, along with everything else, is a quality sans
sense that many of us tend to cling to the causal "rise" of. But the "I"
that cannot win can at least provide the means to imagine yourselves as
possessors of a pair of balls to scratch; monkey balls, perhaps.  & attached
to a stalwart root of introspective pride, as if in outward display, size
mattered to the panting face able only of getting it off "on" someone,
though I've yet to see a spot of wet from either side.  Perhaps you'll "pool
your resources" and come to an agreement, if only in the ecstasy of the
"little death" through which the male ego is revoked.  Ejaculation as
expression is the permeation of, in this case, a desire ("to be right") that
can never be reached "in the language", though I have to admit that the
language of "this" post has got my pussy wet.  Size and opinion may not
matter, but "intensive adjoining" in the occasion sure does.

First, I must admit that when the Myung Mi Kim news article was
posted by Ch. Bernstein, I had a knee-jerk reaction to the way she
spoke of poetry. It's not the way I like to hear poetry spoken of. She
uses a coterie-rhetoric of a coterie to which I don't wish to belong.
Imagine that kind of language being tossed around at a departmental
cocktail party . . . I'd be the quiet one in the corner, gaging. Or gaged,
depending.

And then I read some of her poetry (posted by Jim Behrle). I liked it
quite a bit. I would like to hear her read this (forget the cocktail
party). I liked the tonally flat revisions of newspaper (-like) content.
The choppy sentences. The juxtapositions. Quite well done. So now
I'm interested in reading more, and I bear her no resentment. I
promise!

But I think resentment and ambition are two important tools for the
artist. The "wait 'till they get a load of this" moment. If "ambition" is
read as a looking for the world in its worlding state, to approach it and
bring something back . . . or as (pardon me for a pop refrence)
Leonard Cohen puts it in an old song: "looking for the card that is so
high and wild he'll never have to deal another." That's, I think, a
laudable artistic ambition.

And then there's the ambition to have a job. To have a brave new
career. I wouldn't mind having one myself. (If you're going to MLA in
NY this December look me up, we can talk of those who "capitulate to
terms sanctioned and policed by the prevailing, dominant discourses
invested in 'the point of the talk.'") And as for the continuing need for certain
inclusions in academia, I find myself greatly underrepresented, naturally.
Maybe we should count how many adopted children there are . . . the voice
of the adopted . . . the re-dis-locations within the sanctified and polite.

And prizes? Awards? We like to fool ourselves with them now and
then. But I'm reminded of an interview The Ohio Review ran with
Mark Strand (who's as famous as they come?) a long time ago. He said
something to the effect that "to the general culture the achievement
of the most famous of the famous poets is so minor, so
inconsequential, that it doesn't rise past the level of failure. We're all
losers." Something like that.

PS. Last I heard he was making something in the realm of $125,000 a
year which sounds like a lot (maybe it was $150,000?) until you
compare it to business. I just heard that my brother is making
something like 80,000 in an entry level position . . . so? He thinks all
poets are dumb, as a rule.

Freud said we are all ill.  He should know.  As Bob's dip into the dictionary
suggests, the goal informs the desire.

On the PC front, I have little doubt, being in the acatomic biz (though not
very welcome there since I offend the opportunists), that Kim's  appointment
was based at least as much on her ethnicity as on the quality of her work,
and probably moreso.  I'm mostly pro affirmative action, but it's getting
more difficult these days to see the sense of it.  Past academic prejudices
in hiring practices had to be addressed.  But only the most naive are unaware
that "group" redress involves its own bigotries, and creates another class of
innocents as targets for discrimination.  Seems we haven't yet figured out
how to treat the wounds of one without shooting the other.

Having noted that, I congratulate Kim whose work seems generally au courant.
It's all a little too mild for my taste, however.  Her meditations seem tame
when compared to the Beats and New York School, for example.  But that kind
of Romantic power/oomph/juice is hard to come by these days.  Still, the old
thing is often the next thing.  I'm looking for that explosion that will blow
everything else off the page.  It's coming.

In general agreement here, but the reference, in context, is hard to
maintain as a positive poetic: "You've seen that man before, his golden arm
dispatching cards; but now it's rusted from the elbow to the finger, and he
wants to trade the game he plays for shelter."  Don't forget what happened
to McCabe.  Brrr.

You're probably right, Aldon.  For some reason, I've known just about no
Chinese-Americans, though I've known a lot of other Americans of Oriental
descent, most of them during my years in LA, but a few here in little Port
Charlotte, too.  But, yeah, there are more than a few Chinatowns, so that's
a fluke, I guess.  Anyone know the percentages?

It wouldn't matter much since I'd be over-ruled most of the time.  But I'd
probably do fairly well in the politically-correct department because I'd
hire on the basis of what I took to be talent, which means I would not VETO
anyone just BECAUSE of politically correct credentials.  Also, I DO like
diversity, so would tend to favor people coming from backgrounds other than
mine--so long as those backgrounds got reasonably significantly into their
poetry, and teaching.

Which brings me to another topic I meant to mention before but forgot to,
the question of the amount of ethnicity in poetry by those of different
ethnic groups.  Seems to me that so far American poets from the far east
haven't gotten much of their ethnic background into their poetry yet.  I
mean, other than subject matter.  I don't think anyone would have been able
to guess the ethnicity of Kim from her poem.  I'll annoy people for saying
it, no doubt, but my impression is that people from China, etc., tend to
assimilate faster and more completely than blacks and Europeans.
Anyway, whereas our country has had strongly ethnic poetry from Chicanos,
Blacks and Jews, we don't seem to have it from Chinese, Japanese, etc.

I don't intend this as any kind of criticism.  It just seems interesting to
me.  It may be that we European-Americans pre-empted them by stealing the
haiku and related forms from them before they could be the ones to introduce
them into our poetry.  Or maybe I'm completely wrong about poetry by people
from the far east.  I do have humungous gaps in my literary knowledge.

Bob--

Note: I did not say she was an "oriental woman"--if you check back to my
original posting, I wrote of her as a Korean-American poet--not simply as
the member of an ethnic group, but as someone who writes out of a cultural
experience shared by many members of that group.  It's not simply race I'm
talking about, it's the _experiences_ (actual and linguistic)  that come out
of race and immigration.  If you'd spend 10 minutes in Hawai`i, where there
are very many Chinese-American women (among others), you'd realize the
richness that comes of ethnic experience.  And the poverty that ensues when
hiring practices (in academia and elsewhere) do not reflect that richness.
Students benefit greatly from encounters with that plenitude.

Knock knock
        Anyone home?

There's a brown body over there, and a white one over here
let's put them together to see whether one gets darker
or the other gets lighter
or they both get lighter and darker.
=46irst we must ascertain whether
they're alive.

Wait-I've got a better idea:  there's a woman over here
and a man over there (both breathing
heavily).  In the script
I'll be asking you to write
the gender of one will be perfectly counterpointed
  by the sexuality of the other.  You decide.  Beauty
is in the eyes of the cardholder
anyway, and expires accordingly
usually under harassment.

Next comes a lesson plan:
the bar is filled with friends
and acquaintances.
If you can distinguish between them
you're on the road to recovery.  If you can't
you have a price on your head.
Not to worry-keep
to your kind, and you can wear it
with pride.

And we mustn't neglect the kid racing

or liberal?
They'll come in droves

OK, just this once:
I have it on good authority
the kid's a postmodernist
who speaks the truth
in an inflected English, cabr=F3n.  Please
don't expect footnotes
brimming with further
confirmation.

You see, the fashion being
is always after
a fashion, fashionable is
as fashionable does.  That kid?-his folks are wealthier

derivative?
Depends.  Deep

ends.  Choose, and be

its alternatives.

I ordered Niedecker's _Collected Works_, then found a selection of her
poetry titled _The Granite Pail_ for $2.50 at a local bookstore.  I am
thinking of returning the very expensive _Collected_, despite its beauty and
heft; I am a new reader of this poet, so I might not appreciate the

This seems a matter of temperament and chance, not necessary for developing
one's talent. And many times those few poets who become "known" to the
general public do so because their work is easily approached. What is
popular is usually "clawed back to the middle."
I think you have something when you say, "Some have a bigger void to fill
than do others." But even if one doesn't need ambition, there's still a
struggle with the ego, of feeling that one is not being seriously read and
discussed. Some part of all of us remains steadfastly immature. But this
serves too. There are those few--you mention Ginsberg--who thrive in the
public eye. Yet, even in Allan, there was the void.

Bob and anyone interested:

Before I leave this frayed thread be, here are some suggestions for late =
summer reading:

_Premonitions_, edited by Walter Lew.  Kaya Press.  Excellent collection =
of innovative Asian American poetry.  Many of those anthologized have =
books of their own, which are worth looking at.

_Dictee_, by Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, with sections in English, French, =
and Korean.  Also Walter Lew's homage, DIKTE.

Anything on the Bamboo Ridge Press list, including Lois-Ann Yamanaka's =
_Saturday Night at the Pahala Theatre_, and Gary Pak's _Valley of the =
Dead Air_ (prose).

UH Press is now publishing more work by Asian American writers.  Look =
for Gary Pak's _Rice-Paper Airplane_, or the forthcoming novel by Rodney =
Morales (he's local Puerto Rican, but his subject matter is Hawai`i's =
ethnic mix, among other things).

While you're at it, subscribe to _Interlope_, Summi Kaipa's journal, and =
to _Tinfish_ or look at its chapbook =
series:(http://maven.english.hawaii.edu/tinfish)=20

Nora Okja Keller's _Comfort Woman_ and her newer novel, _Fox Girl_, =
about Korean women caught up in Korean bar culture there and in Hawai`i. =
 Published by Viking.  Prose.

_Hybolics_, edited by Lee Tonouchi.  Good new journal out of Honolulu. =
The next issue features Filipino/a writers.

I could go on and on.  There's tremendous richness here, and I hope you =
take it up.

Someone else mentioned looking for everyone who's adopted.  The remark =
was sarcastic, but I'd like to recommend Jackie Kay's _The Adoption =
Papers_ (Bloodaxe).  Not "innovative," but thematically daring on the =
subject, which is one of great interest to me, an adoptive mother.

aloha, Susan

Jim,

"No one wins," "monkey balls" and "pussy" were the only phrases I understood
in Cat's whole post--oh, and "High Church."  That said, I'm not sure any
flirting's going on. And *that* said, I'm glad to know that I'm you're type!

p.s. I exchanged Niedecker's _Collected_ at Borders for Luna's new CD, Air's
"Moon Safari" and a Housemartins "London 0 Hull 4" to replace the one I've
lost. Some of you will cringe.  Jim, what do you think?

I think of Williams telling Stevens to change some lines in that worm poem:
"For God's sake yield to me, become great and famous!" [quoting from
memory--sorry if not quite right]

Interesting question, because it often gets conflated, I think, with the
issue of the lyric ego or "I."  Is this the same problem?  Not quite,
certainly, but equally certainly the two problems intersect.

My gut suspicion, is that, yes, as obnoxious as it is, ambition is a force
for creativity and conducive to "greatness."  Tho in one way, any evidence
to support this claim would be somewhat circular, since those poets who have
left their skid marks on the drag strip of the canon are very often those
who have lobbied most vigorously to get there, and the question is then: did
they "get there" because they were great or are they "great" because they
got there?

I like poems where I get a strong sense of the author's strong (ambitious?)
personality.  VOICE!  *Gasp*!  Of course, I have a loose definition of
voice: I see this quality, for instance, in work by poets who are often
identified with "anti-voice" poetics:  Grenier, obviously; Bernstein,
Andrews, Hejinian, Scalapino, Silliman, etc.  In fact, I see it more in
these poets than in some of the "voice poets" these poets were initially
rebelling against.

Another circularity: does fame & fortune really militate against innovation,
or does it just seem this way because relatively few innovative poets (or
poets, period) have ever become rich and famous?  Are there clear historical
cases of poets who have "sold out" when they "made it"?  Or is the
perception generally a result of sour grapes?

Who are the ambitious innov. poets out there?  More circularity: are the
ones who seem ambitious really more ambitious than all the others, or are
they just more successful because more readers / editors have liked their
work, or is what we refer to as "ambition" equally accurately referred to as
"hard work"?  I think the "acadominance" resentment enters here as well ...
any innopoet [neologism alert] who lands a secure academic position has
generally been writing a lot of theory as well as poetry, and (amazingly!)
there is a lot of distaste for criticism / theory *on principle* in the
experimental "community."

Jim, I wonder whether the thing we ought to object to is really ambition per
se, as opposed to mercenary cynicism, blatant pandering, and / or just plain
rudeness.  Which seems to be what generated this thread in the first
place....

So when is commentary "rude" as opposed to legitimately critical?  Well, I
didn't really want to get sucked into the whole Kim fracas, but just as a
preliminary gesture toward venturing a definition, I'd say that comments
about Kim's use of what could be perceived as jargony cliches would be
perfectly acceptable.  I would also say that, in this particular case, they
were easily dismissed; several list members have demonstrated the
significatory (real word?) validity of Kim's vocabulary, and in general I
think some people are overly eager to jump on crit-speak without taking time
to ask whether it might ever actually be a legitimate discourse, much like
poetry itself, for expressing complex thoughts in new ways.  Not that it
can't also just be pretentious and bad: too often, it is.

But back to Kim: the objectionable moment occurs when her brief, barely
contextualized comments are adduced to a larger insinuation that she is "not
really innovative" or somehow a phony, a tool of the system, etc.  As others
have remarked, the only thing that could possibly count as evidence toward a
claim like this would be the poetry itself (or, taking things to absurd
levels, a revelation that she actually rips her poetry off of undergrads, or
sits at her desk chuckling "those pathetic suckers, my readers!" as she
types, etc.).

I have to admit, I've had a difficult time warming up to Kim's poetry
myself.  There's a coldness and blank "prettiness" and lack of tonal
variation that I just can't get behind, at least in what I've read so far.
It's like, *not ambitious enough* or something....  But this is purely
personal preference, and I would never argue on the basis of this perception
that she is not "the real thing" or whatever.  Many people whose opinions
and aesthetics I respect are profoundly moved by her work.

This has turned into one of my typical thesis-free posts.  As good a place
to end as any.

See Nietzsche, Homer's Contest,

What a problem opens up before us when we inquire into the relationship of
the contest to the conception of the work of art!

What impresses me (and of course I'm impressed--one would have to have his
head in the sand, or to be in almost pathological denial not to be, or, must
I apologize for being impressed?) is that more people are writing today
(call it poetry, language poetry, language writing, or avant-garde) because
of Bernstein, Andrews and others than because of either Pinsky or Collins or
others.  This places Bernstein, Andrews and others beside Ginsberg, Plath,
and Whitman (and I'll happily include Dickinson, Eliot, Stein and other
Americans, and as this is in re, in part, to the poet
-what-is-it-good-for-laureate).

However, it is one thing to generate poetry (the writing of it, the coming
into being of it, if you will, among those upon whom your word and person
fall) and another to generate an appreciation of poetry.  The non-poets I
know who read, all have books by G., P., W., E. and D. on their shelves and,
for the most part, derive their appreciation of Poetry from these
(certainly, not much has changed since the classroom--albeit, for myself, at
least, I read Dickinson as though she were my contemporary).

Question.  Are facts unbiased?

But of course there are no facts, only interpretations.

I reply:

True in my knowledge as well. And among academics as well. (non
poetry types) But, though history is not kind to most poets (of any
stripe), history is most unkind to poets well read by non-poets in their
lifetimes. (or perhaps to say, rather than history, the academics that
decide what gets read by generations of students) So when we speak
of competition . . . the "king of the cats" . . . well, we just talk and
talk. Then there's old Ludwig, who admonishes us to pass over in
silence what we can't talk about . . . but even he couldn't really do
that . . . poor guy.

Yes, keep the Collected, but get Granite Pail too!  It's a quite
well-chosen selection, with a quality of distillation that is (inevitably)
missing from the bigger book.

One day at work the department's secretary was driving us all a little crazy.
 There was a bumble bee careening around the office.  The ceilings are high
and the bee was bouncing among the flourescent lights.  Occasionally it would
swoop down close to one of us.  Anyway, the secretary wanted that bee out of
there right away. Neither my boss or I or another colleague could catch it or
shoo it out of the building. It was a crafty little bee.  Finally,  our
secretary put a flower blossom in an empty Pringles potato chip cannister.
She stood perfectly still in the middle of the office with the cannister held
at arm's length.  The bee circled the room as it checked out this new
development and then slowly began a lazy spiralling descent into the Pringles
cannister whereupon our secretary calmly snapped a plastic lid over it.

from "Comment" by F.D. Reeve (in the August issue of
poetry, pp 283-298):

"...in the commercial literary world, the poet is a
hitch-hiker or a wagon driver working the road sides;
but in the sideshow of the semi-private literary
world, the poet is a maker [...] Many of the poets
assume that the traveling public won't stop for them.
Some seem not to trust their readers. Therefore, they
keep circling their own lives and the lives of
families and friends, as if the philosophical
assumption of generalizable individuality were fair,
but identification with the reader were not [...] It
is the curse of our age that even our best poets seek
recognition without being able to believe in the power
of their own poetry..."

whatever you think of the metaphor ...

This passage from Paul Fussell's _Great War and Modern Memory_ seems to
speak to the persistent opposition of art vs. theory on this list (even to
the rancor caused recently by 'permeations that attract, avulse and
engender', I think).  -Aaron


+ + + + + + +

No soldier who has fought ever entirely overcomes his disrespect for the
Staff. David Jones is one in whom forty-five years after the war that
disrespect is still vital and fructive. In his essay "The Utile," in _Epoch
and Artist_ (1959), his point is that to make art one must hurl oneself into
it, get down into one's material, roll in it, snuff it up: know it, in fact,
the way troops know fighting, rather than the way the Staff conjectures
about it:

"Ars is adamant about one thing: she compels you to do an infantryman's job.
She insists on the tactile. The artist in man is the infantryman in man. ...
all men are aboriginally *of* this infantry, though not all serve *with*
this infantry. To pursue the analogy, this continued employment 'away from
the unit' has made habitual and widespread a 'staff mentality.'"

Which is to say that the artist is overweighed by critics, reviewer,
discussants, conjecturers, manipulators. "Today," Jones concludes, "most of
us are staff-wallahs of one sort or another."

I strongly prefer the new Collected - you MUST appreciate what only the =
new Collected can provide, and that's the deliberate seriality of much =
of the work, especially if a new reader of Niedecker.  It's a central =
facet of her work that is somewhat missed by certain selections from the =
work.

thanks for the list, Susan.  I checked at the library of a middle-sized
state university and the public library (50,00 lost souls) and none were in
and the librarians never heard of any of the names.  Isn't it also about
time to see some readinglists here?  If any get posted I'll send them on.

Dear Tom--oh, that's so symptomatic, isn't it?  So try some more on them:

Jessica Hagedorn--novels, poems, and collections of other people's good
work.  _Charlie Chan is Dead_ is a good start.  Or _Dog-Eaters_.

Eileen Tabios--poems, collections, essays.  She's on poetix!

R. Zamora Linmarck, _Rolling the Rs_.  Mixed genre writing about growing up
Filipino in Kalihi (Honolulu).

Linh Dinh, anything by this guy.  He's got a Singing Horse chapbook, a Leroy
chapbook, and a Tinfish chap of translations from Vietnamese poetry.  Of
course libraries don't much carry chaps.  He also has a volume of short
stories and a collection of Vietnamese lit.  His writing is so disturbing
that the Tinfish designer of his next book wants to drill holes in it.

Barbara Tran--another collection of Vietnamese American work.  She has a new
little book from Tupelo Press herself (poems).  Lyrical surfaces: more
disturbing stuff inside.

And again--I'm only scraping the surface.  Get your library to order these
books!  (And thanks for looking.)

aloha, Susan

Mime-Version: 1.0

Dear listers,

I am currently working on a study of the poetic still life and am
especially interested in poems dealing with food. So far, I have dealt with
the works of Gertrude Stein, Wallace Stevens, Marianne Moore, WC Williams,
Elizabeth Bishop, Hart Crane, Francis Ponge, Robert Bly, Richard Brautigan
and Harryette Mullen in a perspective emphasizing the conjuctions of diet
and discourse.

Can anyone point me to other poets or poems dealing with the representation
of foodstuff (especially in the post-war period)?

Many thanks in advance.

Michel Delville

Michel:

You might be interested in a little Brautigan story, from my "Inside the

YES - it's a curious kind of seriality tho, constrained/shaped by the
exigencies of publication (mostly lack thereof): the series is more
often than not reshaped, condensed, combined with materials from
previous series; and then on the other hand you get the "homemade" poems
and the calendar-page series done as one-shot gifts and probably not
intended for publication...

it's also quite shocking to flip thru the notes in the back and see how
MANY poems, one great one after another, were never published before.
also the quote-unquote surrealist stuff from the mid-thirties is quite
something...

And you MUST read all those notes -- There are some real treasures in the back
of the book -- You have not read the complete Niedecker if you don't read the

Trust the tale, not the teller. But what if there would not only be no =
tale without a teller, but no teller without his or her tale? Teller and =
tale are bound in an interdependency far more complex than usually =
supposed. After all, the "narrative turn" in the humanities is born of =
an insistence that there are modes of experience that cannot be captured =
by a theory that would transcend the historicity of experience. One's =
story, then, cannot be assumed. But it can be denied.=20

Well, judging from the votes thus far, I guess I fucked up royally by
returning the _Collected_ volume to Barnes & Noble. At least I enjoyed some
new Luna on the way into work today, and my kids danced to the Housemartins
after baths last night, and Air rocked my living room for nearly an hour on
Saturday night.  All this and I still own _Granite Pail_.

Speaking of which... I would like to know what kind of music we're listening
to; recent CD purchases?  As to me: although my Townes Van Zandt craze
petered out, he's now a mainstay in my collection.  I have been spinning a
lot of old Steely Dan and Donald Fagen albums ("Florida Room," wow).  Still
loving Palace Bros "Viva Last Blues"--that's durable songwriting-- though a
multi-year Guided By Voices addiction fizzled last fall.

One of my favorite sequences in the Collected is "Next Year Or I Fly My
Rounds Tempestuous." Each poem in the series was handwritten on a 1935
calendar page.  The calendar pages have been reproduced in holograph. Here's
a sample :

I am excited to announce that on Saturday 21 September and Sunday 22
September I will be reading my poetry at the Under the Influence Festival.
For those readings I will be joined by poets Lee Ann Brown, Lisa Jarnot, and
Michael Boughn.

The Under the Influence Festival from 19-22 September will celebrate the
artistic legacy of the Black Mountain College, which closed its doors in
1956.  The weekend of the festival marks the 50th anniversary of the first
multimedia "happening", called Theatre Piece No. 1, which was arranged by
composer John Cage and performed at Black Mountain College.

The Under the Influence Festival lasts from Thursday 19 September through
Sunday 22 September at various venues in Asheville and Cullowee, North
Carolina.  The festival will feature performances, installations,
exhibitions, film screenings, poetry readings, lectures, roundtables, and
workshops from musicians Pauline Oliveros, Tony Conrad, Mark Hosler, and
John Cobb, installation artists Yoko Ono and Jack Dangers, educators Sue
Riley and Greg Ulmer, filmmaker Craig Baldwin, dancer Ray Eliot Schwartz,
and many others.


More About the Reading

Lee Ann, Lisa, Michael and I are scheduled to read Saturday 21 September
from 6-8 PM at Malaprop's Bookstore in Asheville.  Then at 1 PM on Sunday 22
September we will host a brunch at the Black Mountain Center for the Arts
Gallery.  Following the brunch at 3:15 PM will be a final reading and
discussion at Camp Rockamount, the site of the Black Mountain College

About Black Mountain College

"For a short time in the middle of the twentieth century a small town in
North Carolina became a hub of American cultural production. The town was
Black Mountain and the reason was Black Mountain College. Founded in 1933,
the school was a reaction to the more traditional schools of the time. At
its core was the assumption that a strong liberal and fine arts education
must happen simultaneously inside and outside the classroom. Combining
communal living with an informal class structure, Black Mountain created an
environment conducive to the interdisciplinary work that was to
revolutionize the arts and sciences of its time."
 -- from PBS's "American Masters"

Black Mountain College numbers among its former students and teachers such
luminaries as Charles Olson, Josef and Anni Albers, Walter Gropius, Jacob
Lawrence, Buckminster Fuller, Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, John
Cage, Robert Creeley, Alfred Kazin, Merce Cunningham, Paul Goodman, Cy
Twombly, Jonathan Williams, Robert Rauschenberg, John Wieners and Lou
Harrison.  The college was started in the 1930s by Jack Rice and Theodore
Dreier in association with refugees from the Bauhaus School after the
Bauhaus dissolved under pressure from by the Nazis that same year.

I think that most of the Asian American writers below use more than just subject
matter.  Like Kim since her first book, most of the following writers explore
intersections of English and Asian languages and/or literature, at least to some
extent.  Hahn, for instance, writes zuihitsu, a prose form that looks like good
old american prose poetry--but Hahn apparently takes her inspiration from The
Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon (10th century Japanese woman).  Without some
knowledge of Korean, it is pretty hard to see some of Kim's exploration of those
intersections, or lack of them ("One gives over to a language and then / What
was given, given over?" from "Into Such Assembly" in Under Flag).   I think that
most of these writers are not from the far east (unless I am from Germany) but
regular Americans with not fully assimilated poetics.

hey, talk more about django. what's that music like?
(aside: in anais nin's novel "4 chambered heart" (one
of her best) she combines django with her then lover
gonzalo to create the character of rango--so the
relevant portions of interest are the ones where she
describes rango's guitar playing in the bar--beautiful
enough to make me want to listen to the original
inspiration)

so in terms of alice coltrane, i've listened to
"universal consciousness," "eternity," and "journey in
satchidananda"--

i think UC is a brilliant, brilliant album, but
certainly bizarre and difficult--in it she plays very
experimental jazz based on traditional hindu mantras
and ragas: there's a piece based on "sita ram" as well
as an incredible one based on the "hare krishna"
mantra. not an easy listen.

i think i can safely recommend "journey in
satchidananda" as an album everyone should own. i
should add that i am not really a jazz fan; was drawn
to alice c. because of her hindu and devotional
affiliations, but journey in s. is an album i've
listened to over and over again; very much in the
spirit of the other coltrane, also very devotional and
using indian ragas and instruments but not as
"out-there" as UC--

"eternity" is also solid and is a little less "jazz"
than the other two; veering towards "jazz-classical",
in fact the last track is a piece of Stravinsky "rite
of spring" played better and with more of stravinsky's
spirit than any other version i've ever heard.


kazim.

Today I'll listen to as much Cage as I can. The below came this morning,
thought it was worth sharing. -- Pierre

In John Cage¹s memory, who died ten years ago, on Aug 12, 1992
______________

In February 1992 someone had sent a bag of herbs from Turkey, asking me to
deliver them to John. I lived in the same neighborhood. I called him and
he said I could bring them over. He was in the center room, sitting at the
table with a pile of paper in front of him. He said he was getting ready
to leave for a concert on the West coast and was studying the score which
the computer had just generated. He was excited. He said a woman had come up
with a great idea: "she will fill water into large containers, add some
pebbles and then freeze them. Then, she will hang these ice blocks from
the ceiling of the performance space and place bamboo sticks (randomly) on
the floor. When the ice blocks melt, the pebbles will begin to drop and,
when they hit the bamboo sticks, they will produce sounds." She had asked
John to accompany this performance and that¹s where he was going. I asked
him
what he was going to play, he answered "long notes, of course, what else?" I
had been going through some pretty depressing period;  this time his
enthusiasm and cheerfulness about this very typical sounding project puzzled
me a
bit.

Then he asked me how I was doing. I said I felt very confused and lost
and started telling how I cancelled my concert, how difficult it was to
switch to electronic music and so on. I said I was thinking of finding a
teaching job, he said "don¹t, it is a waste of time." I mentioned my plan to
sell
national anthems to the new nations popping out here and there those
days, he said THAT I should pursue. Then he abruptly asked my age. I said
"I¹m
forty now." "I thought so," he said, "you exactly sound like you are forty."
He told me to relax and be patient. "You are going through the most
difficult year of your life. Just give it a little time, you¹ll see that
in a year or two half of the unnecessities in your life will disappear and
leave you in peace and everything will be wonderful." It sounded like
the best thing one could say to me at that point, said in the best of all
possible manners. He leaned forward and said "guess how old I am!" I said
"you must be in your late seventies." "I am turning eighty this year."
"How does that feel?" "It feels like soon I will be left with no unnecessity
whatsoever."

There are two musicians who just stop the world for me and make me smile:
Louis Armstrong  |   Django Reinhardt

And, in many ways, they have similar temperaments for me. Both have that
old world sound that is completely contemporary. Django is called the
"gypsy guitarist," who with played Stephane Grappelli for much of his life.
Django died of a stroke in the mid 1950s. He was a big drinker / bon vivant
who was unreliable. He was known for missing gigs and being "free
spirited," and you can hear it in his, what sound to me, improvisatory
swing numbers. But, when I use the word swing, I do not mean Glenn Miller
Orchestra WWII American swing. I mean a more open and less defined European
gypsy swing in which one can hear a faint echo of klezmer and a loud
pronouncement of Django's smile as he created a magnificent guitar sound.
His sound is unlike anything else I've ever heard or, say, something that
is only his like Coltrane's sound is only his, like Miles' sound is only
his, like Louis's sound is only his, like Billie Holiday, etc. etc.

bless cage. my favorite moment in MUSICAGE (there are
so many moments though) is in the preface when Joan
Retallack vows never to put anything related to Cage
in the past tense.

he's present indeed.

i just came from a weekend at a Zen retreat there,
sitting, facing the blank wall, I "heard" Cage. or as
yogis say: "the unstruck sound".

The strong Cage recommendation from the new Cage
listener: Joelle Leandre's rendition of
"Ryoanji"--which, Pierre, I happened to buy in Albany!

Purple Tape is great.

Also listening to a lot of Talking Heads lately,
particularly the first two albums.

I always forgot what a genius the young David Byrne
was (not that his later stuff isn't great too...)

It looks like there may be a couple openings for my fall prose
workshop, which will meet 10 Monday evenings from 7 to 10.  The
dates: September 23 through December 2.

By prose I mean fiction, nonfiction, prose poetry, including (but not
exclusively) anything edgy or experimental.  The workshops are
totally open-ended.  Each student typically gets a half an hour each
time we critique.  The classes are limited to 8 students.  Lots and
lots of personal attention.  They take place in my South of Market
apartment, which comes complete with snacks and one cat.

If you're interested, please email about cost, work samples, etc.

Best,
Dodie

Excellent point.  Another example could be some of Jessica Hagedorn's early
poems that were influenced by Black vernacular, perhaps partly because of the
significance of the Civil Rights movement to the Filipino community.  But
Black vernacular (for Jessica) also evoked "Taglish" the combination of
Tagalog and English (a fact that many readers of her work may not know or
need to know to enjoy her poems).  And when Regie Cabico and other Filipino
poets participate in "spoken word", it may not just be because that's part of
their (pop) culture but also because such spoken word relates to the
indigenous Filipino oral tradition of "baligtasan."

It's interesting to see how poetic form is supposed to reflect ethnicity. I'm
cutnpasting a press release below about my new book, for (yeah) self-promo
but also because this had been written to target earlier an audience that
includes not just poetry/creative writing but also studies encompassing Asian
American literature, Filipino literature, postcolonialism, decolonialism,
history, multicultural studies, among others.

I am partly influenced by paintings to write my poems because it's my way to
avoid narrative since narrative reflects (for me) the use of English as a
colonizing communications tool for the Philippines.  This backdrop need not
be known to a reader of my work because, to the extent I can articulate what
my Muse is about, I think it's mostly about the ravages of Beauty.
Nonetheless, when one reads the poems in my Reproductions book and notices
the lack of Filipino ethnic references in the majority of the poems, one
obviously shouldn't assume that ethnicity was not a conscious influence (or,
que horror, assimilation was a motivation).

(And since I find myself pitching, if you wish a review or exam copy, just
lemme know....)

Anyway,

REPRODUCTIONS OF THE EMPTY FLAGPOLE
Poems By Eileen R. Tabios
Release Date: November 2002
Media Contact: Jane Augustine, (212) 533-1928
www.MarshHawkPress.org


Reproductions of the Empty Flagpole  is full of lovely, surprising
conjunctions: "the sound of fireflies mating, the thin sliver of a
distant moon, ... no premonition for such blinding light."
--Arthur Sze


Marsh Hawk Press is pleased to announce the publication of a selected prose
poem collection (1996-2002) by Eileen R. Tabios entitled REPRODUCTIONS OF THE
EMPTY FLAGPOLE.  This is the first U.S.-published poetry book by Ms. Tabios
who is a recipient of the Philippines' National Book Award for Poetry.

REPRODUCTIONS's primary influence is the inspiration provided by a wide
variety of art works, ranging over ancient Greek art to abstract
expressionism to contemporary minimalist sculpture.  Ms. Tabios combines
ekphrasis with a postcolonial sensibility informed by writing in English as a
language once used to help colonize her birthland, the Philippines.  In
addition, Ms. Tabios' approach incorporates her interest in re-imagining
Identity to reflect her location in the Philippine diaspora.

REPRODUCTIONS offers a compelling introduction of Ms. Tabios' poetry to an
American audience.  Ms. Tabios has written three poetry collections
previously published in the Philippines.  While Ms. Tabios' poems are widely
published in a variety of U.S. journals and publications, REPRODUCTIONS
offers a comprehensive compilation of her poems.

In the United States, Ms. Tabios also has been praised for her work as an
essayist and editor through such books as Black Lightning (Asian American
Writers Workshop/Temple University, 1998), recipient of a Witter Bynner
Poetry Grant and a PEN Open Book Selection; The Anchored Angel: Selected
Writings of Jose Garcia Villa (Kaya, 2000), recipient of a PEN/Oakland
Josephine Miles National Literary Award; and Babaylan: An Anthology of
Filipina and Filipina American Writers (Aunt Lute Press, 2000), recipient of
a National Endowment of the Arts Grant.  The former editor of The Asian
Pacific American Journal, Ms. Tabios is also the poetry editor for "Galatea
Speaks," an imprint of Kaya Press as well as the forthcoming anthology,
Screaming Monkeys (Coffeehouse) which will critique images of Asian America.
Most recently, Ms. Tabios received (with Summi Kaipa) a 2002 Potrero Nuevo
Fund Prize, a program of the Potrero Nuevo Fund and administered by New
Langton Arts that awards $12,500 to Bay Area (CA) artists whose community
based works promote consciousness of the local urban ecology.

The intellectual layers underlying REPRODUCTIONS make the book appropriate as
a text for studies encompassing a variety of disciplines.  While obviously
fitting for poetry and creative writing courses, REPRODUCTIONS also fits
studies addressing Asian American literature, Filipino literature,
postcolonialism, decolonialism, history, multicultural studies, among others.
 In combining ekphrasis with decolonialism concerns, Ms. Tabios offers poems
unusual in their approach and content.  Her path is summarized in one of the
epigraphs to her book, when she quotes Buddha for having said:

Don't take my word for this.
Put no head above your own.
Have your own experience.


REPRODUCTIONS has received the following advance words:

Her poems allow our minds to be excited twice, by the psychological and
artistic reference points from which the words zoom-out like handpicked bees
from a hive, and by the vivid hum of the poems themselves demonstrating a
captivating, utterly original imagination. In her lines, which are at once
strict and sensual, Eileen Tabios inserts stingers barbed with wit and
political incisiveness. The crisp, almost scientific clarity of her syntax is
relentlessly undermined by fabulous leaps from sentence to sentence, by
paradox, radical juxtaposition, lurking sexual innuendo, and unpredictable
narrative swerve.  Hers is a poetics of social and cultural interrogation in
which she succeeds in uniting what she would call "the convex with the
concave." _Reproductions of the Empty Flagpole_ will stand you straight up.
--Forrest Gander


How often do you come across language so lavishly expansive that any
description you can think of seems laughably one-sided? Better just to slap a
warning label on it: "Danger: Contents combustible on contact with reading.
Includes poems so fired up they'll sear your fingerprints off as you feel
your way through them (instant identity loss). Others brilliant enough to
burn after images into your retina. Handle recklessly if at all."
--Barry Schwabsky


"And what is seeing?" asks Eileen Tabios, in this volume of prose meditations
on travel, eros, art, and innumerable other subjects, objects.  Tabios'
answers--her seeings--come out of an amazing range of references, from Buddha
to Salman Rushdie to Anais Nin to Anne Truitt to a nameless investment
banker; from the Ancients to the Romantics to the Moderns and back again;
from the Philippines, as from the United States.  Through it all, reader and
writer find themselves "losing uncertainty" through Tabios' "eroticized
history," which earns its final exclamation, "worthy is the price: Yes!"
--Susan M. Schultz


Much of Eileen Tabios' poetry hits us right in the gut. Or should we say
groin, since it is at once scintillating, skittish and seductive. Primal in
its experimentation, fugitive in its tactile manipulation of recalcitrance
and romance, ultimately there blooms a hardcore quality to her corpus'
radical engagements. None of the formulaic ploys is on show here; rather a
robust desire to attach, if so subtly, vivid back stories that pique and
shape our palpable interest with full-bodied allure. The uniformly sensuous
appeal of her wide-ranging work -- from the lyric to the exegesic, to the
imperial prose units -- is served by no less than either a canny courtesan or
a come-hither voluptuary. Or both. Universally is she betrothed.
--Alfred Yuson

yes, there's a foregrounded torus; it remains consistent with the
camera. it reflects only the nearby lamps; everything is cauterized
in mid-atmosphere.

the torus will move, slowly, against all odds.

globes of light, sparks, emanations, appear from two helical sources;
they shape themselves in parabolic arcs; at times they appear exhausted
and almost inert. they are ignorant of the truth of their convention.

the sources move towards the camera, as if burning the world from
serious sparklers. invisible, glass the density of airless air.

the pulverized object flies among them; skin with originary wound;
genital; cotton. its back is turned. the sky is blue and black and full
of stars.

revisions, and I am doing a series of translations of all the revisions,
except that I stopped afterf the secind revision due to a million other
pressing projects....).

The point of g music or writing or any other art, as I see it, is to achieve
the uniqueness you describe. Django, Armstrong, Coltrane...you could always
tell who they were in the first measure they played. That's the way I like
it.

Everything Django played after the melody was improvised, using the tune's
harmonic structure as a base.

Hi Aaron,

I'm not sure if you can get much of the stuff I'm gonna list at Borders or
even Tower's World Music store in Manhattan, but I'm looking up some URLs
where you can hear some of it at least. You can also buy CDs in at some of
these sites--though they're more expensive that way (I get them in bodegas &
tiny neighborhood stores in Brooklyn & Queens where they're sometimes as low
as $2.50; online they're usually about $12).

This weekend I picked up Dava Gjergji's "S'jam fajtor se jam shqiptar" and
Motrat Mustafa's "Per Ju ge e doni kengen shqipe" at the Albanian bodega on
Church Avenue (Brooklyn). You can hear Dava (a different CD, but actually a
better one, in fact a *great* one!) at:

www.muzikanet.com/dl.shtml

scroll down until you find her. (It's alphabetical by first name.) This is a
particularly wonderful website because it starts right off with Adelina's
"Fuck the Government" from her CD S'JAM SEX BOMBE, which I can assure you
the Albanian bodega on Church Avenue does not carry.

There's some Motrat Mustafa at:

www.geocities.com/ilirm2000/muzike/mmustafa.html

http://muzika.albasoul.com/index.php?id=25

and

http://muzika.albasoul.com/index.php?id=24

The weekend before I picked up a bunch of Naseebo Lal CDs at the Pakistani
music & video place on Coney Island Avenue. It's hard to resist, because
she's got more than 100 (I think she's still in her late thirties or early
forties), her voice is amazing, every CD is different (usually a single
composer per CD), and they're $4 each. Most are labeled simply by volume
number (so for instance, one I got this weekend was Volume 5, with music by
Wajahat Atre & M. Ashraf, lyrics by Altaf Bajwah).

Naseebo is so fucking cool it hurts to listen to her. I didn't really find
her best stuff online, but this will give you a taste:

http://www.apnahome.net/apnaorg/music/naseebo/

play the second song down, "We TooN WichRan WichRan Karda Ain," which is
pretty good. That site also has stuff by Abida Parveen, Noor Jehan & other
greats, too. There's some more Naseebo (plus a picture--dig the outstanding
purple lipstick) at:

http://12.152.236.94/naseebo-lal.htm

Also last weekend I went Bay Ridge down Fifth Avenue to get a bunch of new
Arabic stuff. I got Ghada Ragab's "Awa'at Bahin," but it's disappointing.
She has an *amazing* voice, so it's a Super Bummer when the music sucks.
But, then, music is very personal, and others may like it. It can be heard
at:

http://www.mazika.com/Song.html?Country=Eg&Singer=57&Album=792

I also got a Cheba Nawar tape ... I thought she was Algerian, but the
Moroccan woman in the store where I found it said she's Moroccan, which
makes sense I guess, considering the particularly Moroccan use of violin and
the kind of percussion, which you don't hear (or I haven't heard) in
Algerian stuff. Anyway, Nawar's totally fucking amazing--but, unfortunately,
I didn't get a single hit on her name through Google.

And a Kazim Al Saher CD, "Ba'ad Al Hob," which is EMI, so probably available
at Tower, etc. Do people know him? He's the most famous living Iraqi singer,
I'm pretty sure, although I think he lives in exile (I read somewhere he was
shot at in Iraq, though that was in this awful World Music book that seemed
to have some weird bogus info in it). This particular CD is all about
Super-obsession Love Songs (forgive this awful translation): "... take me
far away from all the people around us ... let's get drunk from love ...
make me live ... make me die ... hold me, let your breath turn inside me ...
you own every inch of my body." ("Dhomni Ala Sadrak") His most recent stuff
is very world-music-y mainstream and (to me) pretty unlistenable, but this
is a somewhat older CD, from I think 1995. An earlier, more love-drunk
Kazim!

Here's a huge website devoted to him:
http://www.geocities.com/kazempage/main.htm

This is going on too long--but I'm kind of obsessed with this stuff.

I also recently got Najwa Karam's "Oyoun Albi" and Asala Nasri's "Ya Sabra
Yana"--I've posted stuff about them before, I think. Asala is Syrian, but
lives in Egypt, and Najwa I think is pretty much Fairuz's only serious
competition, from the mountain city Zahle in Lebanon. While it's true that a
number of Algerian singers (Hasni, etc.) have been killed, Najwa has the
distinction of having had a fatwa put on her head for supposedly naming her
dog after the Prophet. It was untrue, of course--she doesn't have any pets.
But, the charge was serious or outlandish enough that I think she's still
banned from Jordan and maybe Qatar, too. She's pretty much the favorite of
everyone I talk to--even the woman at Rashid's. I can see why, cuz she's got
that amazing sometimes husky sometimes femme voice, with the haltingness
that drives arabic music aficianados wild. I had Oyoun Albi on tape, but I
"needed" it on CD. (It was four dollars--it's a bootleg--at an Algerian
bodega on Steinway in Queens, where I also got some Hasni and Nasro.)

There's so much of Najwa's stuff on the web you could probably o.d. on her
without ever leaving your cubicle.

www.go.to/najwakaram

www.musicoflebanon.com/nkaram.htm

www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Set/8510

She's another huge star with an EMI contract, so she's got some product at
Tower, etc.

Okay, I should go now. I didn't really say anything about Asala, but she
deserves a whole 271 line post all to herself! Someday ...!

Bye for now,

Gary

As it happens, I've spent much of the summer turning a house full of LPs, the
veritable record of my past listening, into digital files so that I can carry
them with me on my travels -- was just finishing up the Alice Coltrane sides
when her name turned up here today --

What's been most fun is listening again to nearly forgotten wonders -- like the
World Bass Ensemble -- or Sam Rivers's SIZZLE (which does) -- or the
incomparable Andrew White -- and lots of jazz sides that have never reappeared
on CD ---

and then there's that very first Jayne Cortez poetry LP -- beautiful --

Nice to read a firm voice on this assimilation thing here, Aldon.  I think
there's probably a much better term but i can't think of it offhand.  I see
it more as an enrichment process.  i was thinking of this as I walked
through my nighborhood this morning.  It's a somewhat decling and 'older'
section of town (if 5 to 10 years is old) that's been surrounded by new
subdivisions.  In any case the ethnic mix is quite diverse and I feel I can
breathe here.

I think the same can happen poetically if we relax and allow it to flourish
rahter than separating out the pieces.  I'd be more comfortable discussing
Myong Mi Kim as a poet rather than as a __________ poet?

Your comment about Nielsen was of special interest to me as my former wife
is someone who had her name changed from Nelson to Nielsen (and nobody can
ever get this right) as part of her rebellion long ago against her family
which had even longer ago become Nelsons to fit in with what they felt was
the dominant ethos of Wisconsin around where Niedecker lived.

Mime-Version: 1.0

If you're going to be in San Francisco this week or this month have
we got a treat for you (that is, if you like David Bowie).

Due to Bowie's visit here this week we are launching a multi-media
tribute to him!  Rex Ray has organized a giant art show "Fascination"
which opens on Thursday (Aug 15) and closes September 30.  As it
happens the opening is on Thursday at 6 p.m. (from 6 to 9).  It's at
Gallery 16 (1616 Sixteenth Street--in the Mission).  Tons of local
and international artists responding to Bowie's work.

There's also a lavish catalogue, also called "Fascination," with work
by all the artists and by the following writers (partial list) Rupert
Adley, D-L Alvarez, Ben Arnold, Brian C. Bauman, Dodie Bellamy, Norma
Cole, Douglas Coupland, Del Ray Cross, Derek Donovan, Phoebe
Gloeckner, Ann Magnuson, Rick Moody (recently cited by THE NEW
REPUBLIC as the "worst writer of his generation"!), Alvin Orloff,
Brian Pera, Amy Scholder, Wayne Smith, Brian Kim Stefans, Brandon
Stosuy, and Michelle Tea.

Inside the catalogue is tucked a CD in which local and international
experimental music ensembles re-do Bowie's historical 70s LP "LOW,"
track by track in a 2002 style.

There's a very handsome web-site, still under construction, that
details all these events.  Go to www.thebowieshow.com and check it
all out.

Finally if you're still with us, Wayne Smith and I are writing a
pageant of David Bowie's life, called "FASCINATION." which will be
presented one night only, Friday September 6, at the LAB.  This
pageant will be acted out by a group of Bay Area poets, painters,
musicians, film-makers and artists.  It is roughly modelled on the
pageant Virginia Woolf writes about in "BETWEEN the ACTS."  I get to
play Angie.  More about this later but please do yourself a favor and
go to see "FASCINATION."

I've been listening to lots of David Bowie and also

"Love at First Sight" from FEVER (Kylie Minogue).

The new SCOOBY-DOO soundtrack also has a great song by Kylie Minogue
recorded during LIGHT YEARS sessions and only released now it's
called "Whenever You Feel Like It."

One of Dodie's students loaned her a CD of the "LANGLEY SCHOOL MUSIC
PROJECT/Innocence and Despair" from the 70s, been listening to that,
it's super and I will be reviewing this for forthcoming issue of
SHUFFLE BOIL.

Also, "ABBA Gold Greatest Hits" and

LULU, "Together" (Duets album UK import).

Yeepee, what a great summer in my head!!!

Almost makes up for the loss of Myung Mi Kim to SUNY Buffalo!

Oh well as Abba says, "The gods they roll the dice, their minds cold
as ice, and someone way down here--loses someone dear."

Once in France


In the middle of Notre Dame, I disappeared.
I forgot to remember myself, to propel myself
as though vastness and structure could undo
the beginnings of sight.  I awoke last night
and could not place the universe.  No scent,
lamp, person beside me hummed into memory
whispering some familiar tune.  I stumbled
to the street below and answered the payphone.

The voice of France offered help not in French,
“The arches are supports of earlier churches;
the universe is a feat in motion.  The scents
and the lamp applaud direction undesignated.
You are plus one contingent in this cycle of spaces—
you may remain on the line, dial a number
or supplement the person you left behind.
These are but a few in a segue of options.”

Jared Fogle Lost 245 Lbs. Parable


 There he was on national tv, Jared Fogle, claiming it was him, not the
shed poundage, who was the real Jared Fogle.  Whenever I smell
mendacity,I get hungry.  Those were the shed poundage’s first words.
Last seen wearing one black shoe and one brown shoe, armed and slightly
dangerous.  You can ask Zena, who used to be Serena, until I bought her
the Vegas showgirl costume.  She took the job at the Indian casino and
that was that.  Because no one is immune from the verb to shed pounds
while you sleep.  What did she leave me with?  The empty gerbil cage, a
jar of jalapeno mustard, a Bipolar-Barbie, with male and female
genitalia.  Back when she was Serena, we used to make love on the roof,
though the roof may say I was a part-time custodian who believed every
day was Sunday, the one day we could make love, because rapture, said
Serena, creates an electrical charge that builds up in the joints and
causes premature arthritis. What’s Swiss cheese without the holes, says
Zena, who’s technically no longer my girlfriend but technically bound to
both Jareds and me through the shared blood transfusion.  As soon as I
saw him on the tv commercial stretching out his trouser waist where he
and the other Jared used to live, I called Zena and we talked about the
time we ate at the Subway and she lost five pounds right before my eyes
just from the rigorous machinations of her jaw on the whole wheat sub.
I’m ok with it, I said to Zena about Jared the Subway celebrity, because
I am ok with it, because what can a tv commercial like that do for you,
really, but leave you with a closet full of empty pants.

In his book "The Physics of Immortality"(1992) Frank J. Tipler writes:
"Surprisingly, it is even unlikely that the human brain stores the memories
of everything that it remembers. Computer science shows such storage to be
inefficient. What probably happens is that only part of a memory is
stored....In fact, what evidence we have shows that our brains do not store
a faithful representation of an experience. Nor do they store an accurate,
complete interpretation of an experience. Rather they store only fragments
of an interpretation of an experience." (p.237) This may partially explain
the literary attraction for the fragment. Found objects represent or reflec=
t
a kind of remembering. Some of them also appear to induce a contemplative
attitude. Ancient Chinese writers employed "scholar's stones" for meditatio=
n
or inspiration. I've long been interested in collecting certain quotes and
aphorisms, a common practice among writers. Fragments and aphorisms like
those of Heraclites, Valery, Stein and Kafka hold a particular fascination.
Such valued quotations are an excellent example of textual
found-collaborative magnetism. Obviously, occasionally certain aphorisms
undergo an evolution from loved quotations to proverbs to clich=E9s. Once the=
y
are clich=E9s the magnetism fails and the fragment may become repellant, whil=
e
still holding a "grain" of truth (many of Benjamin Franklin's adages are
like this). Also, I suspect a lot of modern American writing contains quite
a bit of defiance towards the oracular qualities of aphoristic writing (in =
a
stylistic counter reaction to Emerson, for example). For me, though, such
stylistic avoidance of the oracular gives much American writing a fact
based, journalistic quality that renders much of it overly conversational o=
r
chatty. Two of my favorite aphorisms: "God made everything out of nothing,
but the nothingness shows through." (Valery) and Kafka: "You can hold
yourself back from the sufferings of he world, this is something you are
free to do and is in accord with your nature, but perhaps this holding back
is the only suffering you might be able to avoid." The magic of such
quotations is that they bear repeating. Walter Benjamin, of course, built a=
n
entire mode of research around quotations in his "Arcades Project."

James Kopta, 1972-2002

Local arts community mourns the loss of James Kopta: Musician, author, =
and sculptor born and raised in the capital district.

James' body was found Saturday afternoon in the Mohawk River in =
Half-moon near the Crescent bridge. Cause of death is currently under =
investigation. Police are trying to put together a timeline of where Jim =
was between 6:30pm Friday night and early Saturday. If anyone spoke to =
him by phone or saw him in person between this time or even within the =
last week of his life, call the New York State Police in Clifton Park at =
(518) 383-8583.

James' work included:

- Instrumentalist and songwriter for local bands including Brown Cuts =
Neighbors, Exploding Corpse Action, Hail Mary, Frank Budgen. An =
accomplished guitarist, pianist and composer, he released several =
records, CDs and cassettes and performed all over the country.=20
- James was a prime moving force behind the art and music collective =
Department of Experimental Services.
- Co-producer of videos shown in festivals and galleries, locally and =
internationally.
- Sculptural welder who created his own figurative works as well as =
working with artists George Rickie and Larry Kagan.
- Author of numerous short stories, collected in the books "All of it's =
a Turkey Shoot" and "The Pipe Fitter's Companion".
- He was an active researcher into areas as diverse as biochemistry and =
the decoding of James Joyce's Finnegan's Wake.

Those wishing to share thoughts about James may do so on a message board =
at: http://wowcool.com/james=20
S or email us privately at: budgen@wowcool.com
In the coming weeks, more information will posted on the site including =
mp3's of his music, short stories and other works he produced. To see =
and hear examples of his work go to the main DeptEx page at: =
http://wowcool.com/deptex. Anyone with photos, music, drawings, etc, by =
James: please send a copy if possible to...
DeptEx, 51 3rd st., Troy NY, 12180. We'll return all items ASAP.

Anyone familiar with his work can testify that he had a rare, =
distinctive talent and style. Local bands cover his songs, friends trade =
CDRs of his music, and his video work with the group Brown Cuts =
Neighbors has been excerpted and remixed by a number of video artists in =
the Capital Region. He was a quiet, unassuming presence in the Arts =
community who affected a great number of people with the intense =
sincerity and passion he put into his creative work.=20

A wake will occur between this Wednesday night and Thursday night. As =
soon as a time and place is decided, it will be posted on the DeptEx =
site and another announcement will go out. A performance/jam =
session/party in his memory will occur on a forthcoming date.

right now, I have an on going repeat theme of "Aria" from Glass's "Einstein

the best and first sysithised sound tracks..if any one sees it on CD, let me

the sound track to "Henry Fool, by Hal Hartley.. who I think is brillant..
and does some of the best orginal sound tracks... maybe not on the same
level as Herrmann and Thomson, but close...

I don't know that it's Ornette's band. I'm not familiar with the =
specific
album, but generally Cortez use her and Ornette's son, Denardo, as =
drummer.
She's used Bern Nix as guitarist, and Jamaladeen Tacuma on electric bass =
a
number of times. Some of them have played in Prime Time.

Kevin and friends,

please send information on how to obtain a copy of the catalog --
Bowie's "Low" is one of my favorite LPs -- will this be released
later or separately?  I was somewhat disappoined with heathen, which
lacked what his more techno inspired albums have offered..and i loved
him with P Diddy in "american dream" from training day soundtrack.

also in heavy rotation: cornelius, kahimi karie, momus, buffalo
daughter, towa tei, prince, george clinton and "funky lagos" (an
amazing anthology of nigerian "funk" from the 70s) -- a staple since
i found it almost a year ago

hey you seem to be on a Kylie Minogue kick ,  if you haven't heard
her on "GBI: German Bold Italic" (Towa Tei) you might want to give
that a listen. If this is what she has been doing these last few
years, it isn't any surprise that MTV was slow to catch on.

jk

i seemed to remember some Yoko Ono talk on this list a
while ago, so i wanted to pass on (reiterate?) some
music recommendations there:

(catch my essay on Yoko Ono and Eminem on-line soon at
www.lapetitezine.org)

her first LP "Plastic Ono Band" is pretty much classic
Yoko: strange soundscapes, found sound, noise, but
with incredible musicians: John and Ringo play on all
the tracks--Eric Clapton and Ornette Coleman play on
some of the others--it has a really weird "bonus
track" on the CD that you should skip unless you're
harsh into Yoko's weird, weird sound-work.

which leads me to "Fly", a double-album, wildly
inventive, strange, even unpleasant. this is the album
that people usually associate with Yoko when they
parody her. still, the vocal style has its cultural
roots, is very improvisatory, and god, fun to sing
karaoke to in the shower! the second disc of the album
is made with completely automated instruments "played
by turning knobs, dials only, etc."

in Yoko's middle period she made mostly conventional
pop records, which if you like Bjork, you will
probably like a lot. the best are 'A Story' originally
made during her long separation from John, and then
shelved upon their reconciliation, and 'Season of
Glass,' a classic, made only a couple of months after
John's murder, and produced by Phil Spector--includes
an eery bonus track: Yoko singing one of the songs
into a tape recorder the night John died--

she made some very conventional records in the
eighties...they're okay if you like her other stuff,
and then stopped making music for a long time.

she came back in 1995 with what i think is her best
album, called "Rising," and strangely no longer
available--but it's mostly harder-edged, back to the
avant-garde-punk feel of the Plastic Ono Band LP--the
album that came out last year "Blueprint for a
Sunrise" is also good--a little less drama, a little
more fun--

the collaborative LP's she did with John are pretty
skippable--either too conventional (the later ones) or
too too too weird (the early ones)--although "Kiss
Kiss Kiss" from "Double Fantasy"--for which she won
the grammy--yes indeed, Yoko won a grammy for album of
the year--is currently making the rounds of clubs in
it's new "club version"--

=====
"As to why we remain:/we're busy now/waiting

behind bolted doors/for the season that will not pass/to pass"

What a strange thing to be posting about.

But I've been listening to soundtracks lately--Cat People (1982),
with the best version of Bowies "Putting Out Fire," and the Giorgio
Moroder weirdness, which is more appealing now than when the album
first came out.  I listened to it compulsively when I was writing my
last serial poem "Reptilicus," a horror sci-fi extravaganza that
drove me to switching to prose.

Also listening to the Lantana soundtrack, which Kevin ordered for me
from Australia.  We played it recently when we had Taylor Brady and
Tanya Hollis over for dinner.  Never before did pasta feel so
dramatic.

In the car, it's Space Oddity.  Can keep only one CD in the car at a
time, left in the CD player, with its front removed.  Any more will
invariably get stolen, even without their cases, especially if the
car is parked on the block we live on.  City life.

Thanks for this, Nick.

Quotes usually come from published writing; e.g., publishers have control
over what gets into the vernacular, thus who becomes famous enough to be
quoted. "Grudge not the beloved ghosts their resurrection, nor yourself
communion with them." Paul Hindermith.
With the Internet, however, this is changing, and the names of those quoted
may not be generally known. Call it, the democratization of the found.

Listening to radio -- France-culture (over the net) a series of long
leisurely programs on Tuareg music, recording some of it with Total
Recorder. (An interesting, though not fabulous cd is MUSIC OF THE TUAREGS,
Chant du Monde LDX 274974)

        (( & many thanks to Gary for his post -- I love the range of that Arab
music -- & may I recommend Houria Aïchi, Chants Scares d'Algeria, Khalwa
7243 5 45484 2 0, one of the most moving voices, from the Aures mountains --
thus Chaoui Berber))

        still relistening to the 2 Tom Waits & the last Bobby D, a great pleasure.

        but right now primarily stuck into Harrison Birtwistle's PULSE SHADOWS
(mediations on Paul Celan for Soprano, String Quartet and Ensemble)Teldec
3984-26867-2. Like the songs very much (some of those date & can be found on
older cd/s such as SECRET THEATRE) but not yet sure if the movements for
string quartet that interleaf with the songs work to make the whole cohere.

        plus a Pierre Boulez cd with severtal works of his from the 90ies I was not
familiar with, called SUR INCISES (DG 289 463 475-2). Boulez always makes me
sit up and listen & think. It's not everyone's cup of tea or joe but I've
always been extremely fond of him & Brian Ferneyhough. so there.

        2 inneresting cds in from France. Enzo Cormann (voice) and Jean-Marc
Padovani (saxes) do Kerouac: CHORUS (various choruses from Mexico City Blues
as trans,mopgrified into French by yours truly) and MER (BASED on BIG SUR);
they come via a small outfit called Escotatz! that used to do a beat-oid
poetry magazine called Starscrewer run by Bernard Froidefond. They can be
obtained from Bernard froidefond at: BP 8 / 24590 Salignac / FRANCE. or you
can contact him by email: b.froidefond@wanadoo.fr. A must for kerouac buffs!

        & then of course I listen nearly daily to some Stebe Lacy (& I cld kick
myself because last week he played in NYC & we missed him, ugh -- though the
good news is that he just this month moved back tot the States & is now
living & teaching in Boston, so one shld be able to catch much more of him
hereabouts, I mean statesides geenrally)

Actually my all-time Yoko favorite is from this middle period: "Approximately
Infinite Universe" (1972). It does have a typical early-seventies pop-rock
feel (not a bad thing, in my opinion), but it's also wacky and gorgeous, and
(a double album) quite wide in scope...highlights include "I Felt Like
Smashing My Head Through a Clear Glass Window" (done in fifties rock'n'roll
style) and "What a Bastard the World Is" (a tremulous over-the-top feminist
ballad).

Has anybody out there tried to write lyrics that aren't lyrical?  I write great instrumental music (at least *I* think so), but have never had luck writing lyrics.  Maybe I'm not approaching the work from the right direction.  I've had more luck putting Stein's Stanzas in Meditation to music than writing what could pass as a good folk or pop song.

Is it possible to write a pop song that doesn't have a bit of the lyrical in its lyrics?

I think this is fun and fascinating.

I have recently decided, with thanks to Steve Almond,
who used it as a fiction title, that T-Rex's line
"hubcap diamond star halo" is beautiful poetry.  And I
am knocked out by Joni Mitchell's lyrics on Blue
everytime I listen to it, which is almost every day.
And the other day I heard "You're So Vain" and I think
"I had a dream there were clouds in my coffee" is a
great bit of poetry in that song.

But what have I BOUGHT lately?  The latest Dolly
Parton, the White Stripes, an old Donovan thing I had
on record but not on CD, the VU's self-titled which I
somehow never owned, the new Beth Orton.  I am happy
to backchannel with anyone who wants to talk music.

Love,
Arielle

the animation-anime text


doctor, i'm working with animation; i place words and sparks engendered
surrounding the mouth of nikuko. there's no dialog, only patronage.

patronage is the means of control and withdraw; language becomes
internalized. nikuko harbors the skein of her own construct; a virtual
idol, she inhabits inscription.

we all inhabit inscription; everything is coded, flow against the chaotic
amanuensis that surrounds us, draws us out.

i came to you to place words against the animation-anime; to work through
her presence, her dictation.

there are no plans, except to fill space and frame to the limit, to
comprehend the emissions of nikuko.

this is the flood of the text, doctor; you construct tropologies across
our own; the flood creates her semblance of the real in relation to
everything else, real and virtual, virtual-real.

my life tenders nikuko -

nikuko has drawn us out -

you've been of great help, doctor.

you should try listening to some of Yoko's stuff--the
lyrics are so weirdly off-rhymed that she's either an
awful poet (i don't think that's it), or she's
purposely rubbing the words awkwardly against the
melodic line

i'm not sure that's what you meant--

there's always "Mulberry" off her last album where she
grunts, moans, hoots, hollers, croaks, moans,
otherwise sings the single world "mulberry". for 11
and a half minutes. fabulous, yes. lyrical? hmm.

Re: Vernon's comment, I'd like to think I've learned a lot
about technique -- economy, phrasing, restraint -- from
song lyrics, esp. blues and deep country, which are
literary art forms after all. Those authorless floating
stanzas that populate so much black and white folk music
are just endlessly compelling. ("I have a bird to whistle /
I have a bird to sing / I have a woman that I'm loving /
But she don't mean a thing" -- "Who's that yonder coming up
the road? / It looks like Maggie, but she walks too slow"
-- "A railroad man will kill you when he can / And drink up
your blood like wine" -- "The sun's gonna shine in my
backdoor someday" -- "I'm laughing just to keep from
crying".)

Some things in current/recent rotation --

1. Woody Guthrie, "Dust Bowl Ballads" ("there ought to be
some yodeling in this song / but i can't yodel fer the
rattling in my lung")
2. Flying Burrito Brothers, "Farther Along" ("we've got our
recruits / in their green mohair suits")
3. Bill Monroe & Doc Watson, "Live Duet Recordings
1963-1980" ("what does the deep sea say? / it moans, it
groans, it plashes and it foams / and it rolls on its weary
way")
4. Treasury of Library of Congress Field Recordings
1934-1946 ("sea lion woman")
5. Harry Smith Anthology, Vol. 3 "Songs" ("the coo coo is a
pretty bird / and she warbles when she flies / but the coo
coo never warbles / til the fifth day of july")
6. Townes Van Zandt, "High Low & In Between" ("i'll miss
the system here / the bottom's low and the treble's clear")
7. Ralph Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys, "Echoes of
the Stanley Brothers" ("the darkest hour is just before
dawn / the narrow way leads home")
8. Mississippi John Hurt, Masters of Country Blues Guitar
("blues all on the ocean / blues all in the air / i can't
stay here no longer / and i have no steamship fare")
9. Songs of the Civil War ("though we seek mirth and beauty
and music bright and gay / there are frail forms waiting at
the door" [stephen foster])
10. Emmylou Harris and the Nash Ramblers, "Live at the
Ryman Auditorium" (great version of the above)
11. Steve Earle, "Train A'Comin'" ("won't nothin bring you
down like your hometown")
12. Blind Willie McTell, "1927-1933 The Early Years" ("feel
like a broke down engine, ain't got no drivin wheel")

 what about 'concrete poetry'?

the 'look' of words *on the page* may certainly also
make for poetry. The shifting of meanings and
contexts.  The barren factuality of technical
language. .... Poetry may be lyrical. But is not
necessarily so.

What makes a prose poem a poem?

I would certainly say, despite the crossbreeding I
mentioned before, that song lyrics are HARD to do well, for
endemic reasons, no matter what your thematic parameters.
There are strong implicit constraints at work, like you
can't use too many polysyllables, or you can but if you do
you're going to get a very thick texture that's hard to
adapt to a melody. You have to watch closely how syllabic
patterns are articulated, e.g. Sondheim (not Alan)'s
comment that "for a small fee in America" (West Side Story)
was the product of a naive lyricist, because the singer's
forced to say "for a smafee". And you want something very
simple and singable that's also super suggestive ("The
silence of a falling star / Lights up the purple sky").

Stein is highly adaptable to music because somehow she was
doing all of these things anyway ("sweet sweet sweet tea /
susie asado" -- "a saint is easily resisted") -- I guess
she must have seen composition largely as a sound
patterning activity. Virgil Thomson said that she was easy
to compose for because you didn't have to follow the sense,
you could just focus on the melody that the words implied.
That would be how I would approach "non-lyrical"
songwriting, if I understand what you mean. One of my
favorites is from the "Pigeons on the Grass" aria in "Four
Saints": "Let Lucy Lily Lily Lucy Lucy let Lucy Lucy Lily
Lily Lily Lily Lily let Lily Lucy Lucy let Lily: let Lucy
Lily." Very interesting to me how it deflects
signification, glides around various propositions, and yet
on the level of sound is very tight and even predictable,
almost a palindrome.

you should try listening to some of Yoko's stuff--the
lyrics are so weirdly off-rhymed that she's either an
awful poet (i don't think that's it), or she's
purposely rubbing the words awkwardly against the
melodic line

i'm not sure that's what you meant--

there's always "Mulberry" off her last album where she
grunts, moans, hoots, hollers, croaks, moans,
otherwise sings the single world "mulberry". for 11
and a half minutes. fabulous, yes. lyrical? hmm.

Tracy,

If we mean by lyrical, songlike, then you have your answer.  However, another
commonplace is that the lyrical emphasizes personal emotion over a mere
litany of events.  In that case, it is certainly possible to write lyrics
that are not lyrical.  It's done all the time.  I'm not sure how much rhyme
schemes, on or off, figure in the difference.  I wrote music and lyrics
professionally for many years, many years ago, and often avoided the personal
focus--though what sold was the lyrical stuff, of course.

Lyrics per se may be less the issue than harmonics.  Music, even the
discordant, or that which foregrounds its mathematics, can still be
considered lyrical, though that's often a judgment call.  Milton Babbitt as
one example.  Cage also, but he succeeded in at least potentially banishing
the lyrical in 4'33.  I say "potentially" because the presence or absence of
the lyrical in that piece is contingent upon what's going on in the audience
during any given performance.

Once the words are informed by music, one has a hybrid thing, so even the
most impersonal or abstract language is pressed to song.  Yoko Ono's lyrics
are pretty lyrical, I'd say.  I haven't heard everything she's done.  John
Lennon's Revolution #9 may be a candidate, but it ain't no pop song.

Best, Bill

NEWHALEM -- Lofty mountains long have served as inspiration to poetry=20
and song, and as setting for solitary contemplation. On Saturday, the=20
North Cascades provided a scene for verse, but on this occasion, the=20
warmth of long-separated friends coming together.

A half-century after he hung Buddhist prayer flags from the=20
8,129-foot-high Crater Mountain lookout, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet=20
Gary Snyder made his first visit back to the peaks and people of a river =

valley often nicknamed the "magic Skagit."

A mountaintop experience "changes peoples' lives" and shapes later=20
thinking, Snyder reflected. He would persuade two other literary=20
figures, Jack Kerouac and Philip Whalen, to come here in the '50s for=20
summers devoted to Zen and the art of forest-fire detection.

The two months spent on Desolation Peak in 1956 marked the last period=20
of sobriety in Jack Kerouac's life.

"I felt he needed to be alone for a while. ... There had been too much=20
socializing and two much sweet wine," Snyder said of his friend who=20
wrote "On the Road."

Difficult to reach, requiring a boat ride up Ross Lake and a=20
4,400-vertical-foot climb, Desolation meant isolation in the 1950s. With =

no humans about, Kerouac found compelling company in the nearby twin=20
black towers of 8,080-foot Hozomeen Mountain.

"Hozomeen is the Void -- at least Hozomeen means the void in my eyes,"=20
Kerouac wrote. He would stare at it upside-down while doing yoga=20
headstands, which made the mountain appear as "a mess of double-pointed=20
rock/Hanging pouring into space."=20

The lookout has come by a certain popularity in recent years as fans of=20
Kerouac's "Desolation Angels" make pilgrimages to where the noted 1950s=20
non-conformist rolled his cigarettes and wrote his verse.

More visitors are likely. The weekend reunion -- staged by North=20
Cascades National Park -- helped celebrate publication of a new book=20
"Poets on the Peaks," a sensitive and beautifully crafted account of=20
those times by Boston-based writer John Suiter.

Snyder dedicated his reading to Whalen, who later became a Zen Buddhist=20
priest and abbot. Whalen died June 26 in San Francisco.

Snyder did not want for company. From Crater Mountain he could see just=20
two signs of humans' presence on earth -- distant lights from cabins on=20
Sourdough Mountain and Desolation. He was flanked Saturday by the men=20
who lighted those lanterns long ago.

They were a "community of lookouts," in the words of Jack Francis, a=20
B-17 gunner who came home from World War II to become a teacher in=20
Bremerton. Francis was atop Desolation in '52, and recalled Saturday how =

he was moved to have mercy on mice living in the cabin.

On Sourdough was a 19-year-old Native American from Neah Bay, named=20
Schubert Hunter. Now a retired U.S. Forest Service timber worker, Hunter =

cradled a great-grandchild, and shyly produced his first poem to mark=20
the 50-year reunion with Snyder.

Snyder took the poem, "Hawkeye," from his fellow lookout and read it=20
aloud:

"Bald eagle high and nearly out of sight

"Can you see the sunrise, clouds colored bright?

"Hear the whispers of the wind?

"Can you see the river in the valley?

"In a world that never ends, can you see the colors of the sunset?

"In a world that bids us all goodnight."

Looking up, Snyder responded: "That's darned good, Schubert."

Later, Snyder read from the ending of his "Myths and Texts," inspired by =

a fire far up the Thunder Creek valley that he spotted while manning the =

Sourdough lookout in 1953.

"The black snag glistens in the rain

"& the last wisp of smoke floats up

"Into the absolute cold

"Into the spiral whorls of fire

"The storms of the Milky Way."

Snyder was slated to go back to Sourdough in '54, but it was not to be.=20
He was Red-baited off the lookout.

As a college student, Snyder had joined the radical Marine Cooks and=20
Stewards Union to get summer work on a Grace Line passenger ship. The=20
association put him on a blacklist, which extended to all federal=20
employees by the second year of the Eisenhower administration.

"It just indicated the hysteria of the McCarthy era and how nutty it=20
was," Snyder recalled. The Marine Cooks, he added, was an enlightened=20
outfit with three rules: "No race-baiting, no Red-baiting, no=20
queer-baiting."

FBI agents actually appeared in Marblemount to quiz Snyder's fellow=20
employees, an episode recounted in a wickedly funny letter he received=20
from Whalen.=20

Snyder now lives in the foothills of California's Sierra Nevada range.=20
He marveled at how little the upper Skagit country has changed from the=20
mountaintop days when studied Chinese, read Chaucer and watched the=20

lightning storm.

Amid the sprawl of Interstate 5 and spread of megastores, the North=20
Cascades stand out as "something that won't be touched."

Of course, the unexpected happens even to mountain places.

In August 1945, a teenage Snyder climbed the symmetrical 9,677-foot cone =

of Mount St. Helens.

He came down to learn of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and=20

High praise for an inspirational chronicle of fire lookout poets

SPECIAL TO THE POST-INTELLIGENCER

Among the craggy peaks of Washington's North Cascades, there are four=20
mountains that attract a curious sort of pilgrim. None of the four peaks =

is unusually high, or technically difficult to ascend (although some are =

quite remote). Yet each summer, the summits of Sauk Mountain, Crater=20
Mountain, Sourdough Mountain and Desolation Peak attract a few hardy and =

bookish hikers.=20


They come to pay homage to three poets who lived and worked as fire=20
lookouts on the mountains in the mid-1950s.

What attracts these pilgrims to the mountaintop (myself included -- I've =

huffed up both Sourdough and Desolation) is a definitive chapter in the=20
history of both American literature and environmentalism. A magnificent=20
new book, "Poets on the Peaks," tells the story of these three forest=20
lookout poets -- Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen and Jack Kerouac -- in a=20
compelling narrative and luminous photos.

A seven-year project of writer and photographer John Suiter, "Poets on=20
the Peaks" documents how the three very different writers were affected=20
by their work as solitary fire spotters for the U.S. Forest Service.=20

Of the three writers profiled in Suiter's book, Kerouac is certainly the =

most famous. Hard-living, enthusiastic, obsessed with Buddhism, and=20
constantly high on pharmaceuticals and cheap wine, Kerouac served as a=20
lookout on Desolation Peak in 1956. The author of "On the Road" hoped to =

use his time as a fire spotter to write a novel and attain spiritual=20
insight. He was able to do this to some extent, but also found that 63=20
days alone on a remote mountain in the North Cascades nearly unhinged=20
him. Even today, it's a two-hour boat ride up Ross Lake just to reach=20
the trailhead.

Kerouac's experiences were what first sparked Suiter's interest in fire=20
lookouts. Suiter, a Boston-based photographer and writer, had previously =

shot photo essays on Kerouac's haunts in Lowell, Mass., and Mexico City. =

For Suiter, Desolation Peak was at first just another site in the=20
Kerouac story. In 1995, while working on a magazine assignment, Suiter=20
spent two weeks camped at the summit of Desolation. He'd rarely hiked=20
before, and the experience changed him. "It's a magical place," Suiter=20
said. "To be on a mountaintop at dawn -- and everything below is covered =

in clouds and ground fog -- and you're in sunlight. It's a celestial=20
experience."

Suiter shared the finished magazine article with poet Snyder, who now=20
lives on a rural homestead in Northern California. Snyder gave the piece =

his approval but badgered Suiter: "Why didn't you go up my mountain?" he =

asked. The question stuck with the photographer, and Suiter soon=20
realized that the story of the fire-watching poets contained enough=20
material to merit a full-length book. "Gary really challenged me to go=20
back to the Cascades," Suiter said. "His input was crucial."

Snyder, now in his early 70s, is the preeminent poet of Western North=20
America's mountains. He grew up on the outskirts of Seattle, climbed=20
most of the volcanic peaks of the Cascades in his teens, studied Native=20
American mythology in graduate school and apprenticed as a Zen Buddhist=20
in Japan. A quiet presence in the often noisy "Beat" movement of the=20
late 1950s, Snyder is a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet whose work contains=20
equal measures of spontaneity, Asian poetic forms and a keen awareness=20
of ecology. He eagerly signed up to work as a lookout on Crater Mountain =

in 1952 and on Sourdough Mountain in 1953.=20

Unlike Kerouac (whom Snyder talked into serving as a lookout), Snyder=20
thrived in his role as a solitary fire spotter. While Kerouac=20
practically ran off the mountain when his season was up, Snyder left=20
reluctantly. Many of Snyder's published journals and poems (including=20
the recent collection "Mountains and Rivers Without End") refer back to=20
his meditative experience on the peaks.=20

This July, Snyder returned to the Upper Skagit River for the first time=20
in 50 years. During an event in the town of Nehalem, largely organized=20
by Suiter, Snyder and five other former lookouts discussed their years=20
on the peaks. Underneath a large maple fanned by mountain breezes,=20
Snyder read from his lookout poems and paid tribute to Suiter's book,=20
which he said "took us all by surprise."

"Poets on the Peaks" was a labor of love for Suiter, who's a meticulous=20
researcher. In addition to camping on all the lookout peaks, Suiter=20
conducted extensive first-person interviews with former fire spotters,=20
including Snyder and Whalen.=20

Whalen, the third poet in Suiter's account, was a lesser-known but=20
accomplished poet in his own right. Whalen wasn't much of an=20
outdoorsman, and took a lookout job to pay off a debt to Snyder, a close =

friend. Whalen quickly found the lookout life to be an ideal existence.=20
He worked three summers on Sauk and Sourdough mountains and had ample=20
time for reading, writing, meditating, and nature-gazing. Whalen, who=20
later became an ordained Zen monk, died this June. When Suiter presented =

Whalen with a copy of "Poets on the Peaks," the bed-ridden poet, nearly=20
blind, exclaimed, "Ah -- it's wonderfully heavy!"

Much of the originality of Suiter's book is the result of efforts to=20
unearth unpublished letters and journals. Particularly rewarding was=20
being allowed to read parts of a legendary journal that Snyder has kept=20
nearly all his life. Snyder hasn't allowed many writers access to his=20
papers and all would-be biographers have been turned away.=20

"We were down at his place in California and drinking fairly late,"=20
Suiter said. "And Gary came over and had in his hand a stack of old=20
leather-bound journals. He said, 'I think you might want to take a look=20
at these.' It was my last night there and I realized that I was going to =

be up all night reading them. It was fascinating stuff."

So, too, is "Poets on the Peaks," which proves there's more to the=20
history of Washington's mountains than a few crusty miners, loggers and=20
fur trappers.

Gary Snyder's climb was part of the international Year of Mountains.

The United nations had proclaimed 2002 as the International Year of
Mountains to increase international awareness of the global importance of
mountain ecosystems. Poetry On The Peaks is celebrating the relationship
between humanity to nature through poetry by setting up such climbs and
readings on as many mountains in the world and corresponding cities. Those
of us who have taken part in the program so far this year hope to increase
awareness of pressing issues (from over development and acid rain in the
Adirondacks to war in Afghanistan) and promote cultural heritage of mountain
societies around the world.

NEWHALEM -- Lofty mountains long have served as inspiration to poetry
and song, and as setting for solitary contemplation. On Saturday, the
North Cascades provided a scene for verse, but on this occasion, the
warmth of long-separated friends coming together.

A half-century after he hung Buddhist prayer flags from the
8,129-foot-high Crater Mountain lookout, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet
Gary Snyder made his first visit back to the peaks and people of a river
valley often nicknamed the "magic Skagit."

A mountaintop experience "changes peoples' lives" and shapes later
thinking, Snyder reflected. He would persuade two other literary
figures, Jack Kerouac and Philip Whalen, to come here in the '50s for
summers devoted to Zen and the art of forest-fire detection.

The two months spent on Desolation Peak in 1956 marked the last period
of sobriety in Jack Kerouac's life.

"I felt he needed to be alone for a while. ... There had been too much
socializing and two much sweet wine," Snyder said of his friend who
wrote "On the Road."

Difficult to reach, requiring a boat ride up Ross Lake and a
4,400-vertical-foot climb, Desolation meant isolation in the 1950s. With
no humans about, Kerouac found compelling company in the nearby twin
black towers of 8,080-foot Hozomeen Mountain.

"Hozomeen is the Void -- at least Hozomeen means the void in my eyes,"
Kerouac wrote. He would stare at it upside-down while doing yoga
headstands, which made the mountain appear as "a mess of double-pointed
rock/Hanging pouring into space."

The lookout has come by a certain popularity in recent years as fans of
Kerouac's "Desolation Angels" make pilgrimages to where the noted 1950s

shot photo essays on Kerouac's haunts in Lowell, Mass., and Mexico City.
For Suiter, Desolation Peak was at first just another site in the
Kerouac story. In 1995, while working on a magazine assignment, Suiter
spent two weeks camped at the summit of Desolation. He'd rarely hiked
before, and the experience changed him. "It's a magical place," Suiter
said. "To be on a mountaintop at dawn -- and everything below is covered
in clouds and ground fog -- and you're in sunlight. It's a celestial
experience."

Suiter shared the finished magazine article with poet Snyder, who now
lives on a rural homestead in Northern California. Snyder gave the piece
his approval but badgered Suiter: "Why didn't you go up my mountain?" he
asked. The question stuck with the photographer, and Suiter soon
realized that the story of the fire-watching poets contained enough
material to merit a full-length book. "Gary really challenged me to go
back to the Cascades," Suiter said. "His input was crucial."

Snyder, now in his early 70s, is the preeminent poet of Western North
America's mountains. He grew up on the outskirts of Seattle, climbed
most of the volcanic peaks of the Cascades in his teens, studied Native
American mythology in graduate school and apprenticed as a Zen Buddhist
in Japan. A quiet presence in the often noisy "Beat" movement of the
late 1950s, Snyder is a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet whose work contains
equal measures of spontaneity, Asian poetic forms and a keen awareness
of ecology. He eagerly signed up to work as a lookout on Crater Mountain
in 1952 and on Sourdough Mountain in 1953.

Unlike Kerouac (whom Snyder talked into serving as a lookout), Snyder
thrived in his role as a solitary fire spotter. While Kerouac
practically ran off the mountain when his season was up, Snyder left
reluctantly. Many of Snyder's published journals and poems (including
the recent collection "Mountains and Rivers Without End") refer back to
his meditative experience on the peaks.

This July, Snyder returned to the Upper Skagit River for the first time
in 50 years. During an event in the town of Nehalem, largely organized
by Suiter, Snyder and five other former lookouts discussed their years
on the peaks. Underneath a large maple fanned by mountain breezes,
Snyder read from his lookout poems and paid tribute to Suiter's book,
which he said "took us all by surprise."

"Poets on the Peaks" was a labor of love for Suiter, who's a meticulous
researcher. In addition to camping on all the lookout peaks, Suiter
conducted extensive first-person interviews with former fire spotters,
including Snyder and Whalen.

Whalen, the third poet in Suiter's account, was a lesser-known but
accomplished poet in his own right. Whalen wasn't much of an
outdoorsman, and took a lookout job to pay off a debt to Snyder, a close
friend. Whalen quickly found the lookout life to be an ideal existence.
He worked three summers on Sauk and Sourdough mountains and had ample
time for reading, writing, meditating, and nature-gazing. Whalen, who
later became an ordained Zen monk, died this June. When Suiter presented
Whalen with a copy of "Poets on the Peaks," the bed-ridden poet, nearly
blind, exclaimed, "Ah -- it's wonderfully heavy!"

Much of the originality of Suiter's book is the result of efforts to
unearth unpublished letters and journals. Particularly rewarding was
being allowed to read parts of a legendary journal that Snyder has kept
nearly all his life. Snyder hasn't allowed many writers access to his
papers and all would-be biographers have been turned away.

"We were down at his place in California and drinking fairly late,"
Suiter said. "And Gary came over and had in his hand a stack of old
leather-bound journals. He said, 'I think you might want to take a look
at these.' It was my last night there and I realized that I was going to
be up all night reading them. It was fascinating stuff."

So, too, is "Poets on the Peaks," which proves there's more to the
history of Washington's mountains than a few crusty miners, loggers and
fur trappers.

On the road with Tinfish Press

I will be spending much of the rest of this month on the east coast =
(Buffalo, Boston, Northampton, northern Virginia, Boston) and then the =
months of September through December in London, on that other island, =
Great Britain. During that time, Tinfish Press will be releasing several =
chapbooks and the 12th issue of the journal, Tinfish. Please consider =
buying Tinfish products and, if you teach, using them in your =
classrooms. Tinfish is expanding, but that means that expenses are =
growing, as well. We need your help! Forward this message far and wide.

In estimated order of appearance, then:

--_A Piece of Work_, by Murray Edmond. Edmond is a marvelous New Zealand =
writer and dramaturge. This long poem is at once an homage to his mother =
and to the history of New Zealand in the 20th century. Designed by Ken =
Lincoln. I'll announce the price before I leave Hawai`i next week, as =
this one's almost done.

--_Clutch_, by Sawako Nakayasu. Nakayasu is a writer who has lived in =
Japan, San Diego, and most recently in Providence, Rhode Island. Her =
"Hockey Love Letters" are at once about gender, love and ice hockey. =
Designed by Jung Kim.

--_Tinfish_ 12: the back to front issue. The cover was designed by Jung =
Kim, who momentarily forgot that we westerners read from front to back. =
So this issue will run from back to front. Features lots of translations =
from Chinese poetry, as well as the usual mix of Australian, New =
Zealand, Hawai`i, and west coast innovative poetry. Designed by Stuart =
Henley, with centerfold by Duncan Dempster and art by Imai Kalahele. =
Subscriptions are $20 for three issues. Or, $8 each.

--_Pidgin Culture_, by Lee Tonouchi. Hawai`i's "pidgin guerrilla" holds =
forth on the meaning and practice of pidgin speaking, in essay, talk, =
and poem form. Expect to be enlightened, and to laugh. Designed by =
Michael Cueva.

--from The Theory of Subjectivity in Moby Dick, by Deborah Meadows. A =
reading-through of Melville's novel, combining chance operation and =
philosophical investigations of Melville's text. Designed by Jacqueline =
Thaw.

--Steve Carll's fabulous Hamburger (a chap about hamburgers slipped into =
a hamburger sleeve) has just been reprinted. Don't miss this delicious =
Tinfish meal! "I like hamburger" (Sangha Webster Schultz).

Most of these have not yet been priced. Keep your eyes on our website =
(http://maven.english.hawaii.edu/tinfish) for updates, and to see our =
other publications. I will still be on email, as well, at =
sschultz@hawaii.edu. For orders during my time in London, contact Native =
Books through Ron Cox (coxr@hawaii.edu), or ask Clint Frakes =
(clinton@lava.net). Have a wonderful autumn! aloha, Susan

http://www.asiasource.org/arts/kakar.cfm
Sudhir Kakar is widely known as the father of Indian psychoanalysis; he is also
an accomplished novelist, scholar and translator. His most recent work is a new
translation of the Kamasutra of Vatsyayana, which contains not only a complete
translation of the third-century text, but also a historical introduction and
excerpts from Sanskrit and Hindi commentaries.

An Interview with Jael Silliman
http://www.asiasource.org/arts/silliman.cfm

Jael Silliman is an Associate Professor of Women's Studies at the University of
Iowa and the author of the new book Jewish Portraits, Indian Frames: Women's
Narratives from a Diaspora of Hope (Brandeis University Press, 2002). This
immensely personal book chronicles Calcutta's little-known Jewish community
through the lives of four generations of Jewish women in Silliman's family.

Bombay Time
http://www.asiasource.org/arts/umrigar.cfm

Thrity Umrigar is the author of Bombay Time (Picador/ St. Martin's Press,
2002), a new novel that artfully traces ambition and disappointment in the
lives of several inhabitants of a Parsi neighborhood in Bombay. AsiaSource
spoke with the author about her literary influences, India's middle class, and
the emotional impact of the brain drain.

Growing Up Bicultural: An Interview with Tamim Ansary
http://www.asiasource.org/arts/tamimansary.cfm

Tamim Ansary is an Afghan American writer whose September 12 email struck a
chord with millions of people all over the world. AsiaSource spoke with Ansary
about his recent memoir, West of Kabul, East of New York: An Afghan American
Story, and about his life spent at the crossroads between the traditional
Islamic society of his youth and the secular Western culture he came to call
his home.

I Have Seen the World Begin: Travels Through China, Cambodia, and Vietnam
By Carsten Jensen,Barbara
Haveland
                                                                             "Wh
en Carsten Jensen set out by train from Denmark on a journey to the East, he
expected to find lands of rich history and culture, and people undergoing
radical change at the end of the twentieth century. In this illuminating
narrative of his travels, there is this and much, much more." -Harcourt

The Impressionist
By Hari
Kunzru

           "Pran Nath Razdan, the boy who will become the Impressionist, was
fathered in circuitous circumstances by an Englishman and passed off by his
Indian mother as the child of her husband, a wealthy man of high caste. Growing
up in luxury just downriver from the Taj Mahal, at fifteen the news of Pran's
true parentage is revealed and he is tossed out into the street - a pariah and
an outcast. Thus begins an extraordinary, near mythical journey of a young man
who must invent himself to survive - not once, but many times."

In the Absence of Sun: A Korean-American Woman's Promise to Reunite Three
Lost Generations of Her Family
By Helie
Lee

           "Helie Lee often had heard her grandmother speak of an uncle, lost
decades ago when he was a child during the family's daring escape from North
Korea. As an adult, he was still living there under horrid conditions. When her
grandmother began to ail, Helie became determined to reunite her with her
eldest son, despite tremendous odds. Helie's mission became even more urgent
when she realized that her first book, the bestselling novel Still Life with
Rice, about the family's escape, might have angered the North Korean government
and put her uncle in danger." - Crown Publishing Group

Afghanistan Diary: 1992-
2000
                                                                      By Edward
Grazda

    "Afghanistan Diary is a provocative introduction to the recent history of
the troubled country since the Mujahideen capture of Kabul in 1992. Documentary
photographer Edward Grazda witnessed firsthand this hugely transformative
period in modern Afghan history, from the destruction of the capital city five
years into a ruinous civil war between Mujahideen factions, to their defeat by
the Pakistani-supported Taliban militia, whose radical interpretation of
Islamic law--and its draconian enforcement--is unarguably the most extreme in
the Islamic world." - Powerhouse Books

The Art of Calligraphy in Modern China

defining feature of Chinese culture, both a means of communication and a
revered form of art. It has changed more dramatically during the half century
since Mao Zedong established the People's Republic in 1949 than over the
preceding 1,500 years. At first the traditional art of calligraphy was
transformed into an instrument of political power and protest, wielded on an
unprecedented scale. Over the past three decades it has emerged as a more
visually exciting modern genre, which now offers fascinating insights into the
people of modern China." - University of California Press

GOALS & HOPES
When the idea for creating these books was born, I really wanted to reach to
poets and artists, spiritual leaders, and voices of as much diversity as
possible to reach in a short period of time. I feel that goal has been reached.
The youngest participant is a 12 year old boy from Russia and the oldest is 82.
Two classes in digital media from the University of the Philippines made
artwork specially for the books. We have some amazing people taking part in
this, of all different ages and backgrounds. Established voices and new voices.
People from around the world have lent their views and visions to create hope
and healing and work for peace.

Many of the people taking part have been active in creating a dialogue among
nations through poetry for a long time. I feel that this project has all the
potential to reach to people and to help in the healing process we need to go
through as human beings. I find it important to focus on hope and healing at
times when the whole world is at the edge of a world war. I find it important
that people are willing to work towards those goals and I honor and respect all
the people that have taken part.
This is our gift to the world and as I have said to everyone taking part - this
is not my project but ours - the people of the world. The main goal is to open
a dialogue between nations and to sell enough copies so we can give some
sustainable amount of money to UNICEF.

All in all we are creating a platform for openness and tolerance.

Subject:      Thursday: AN AMERICAN AVANT GARDE: SECOND WAVE SYMPOSIUM
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Thursday July 25th
Casablanca's, Mound & High, Downtown  Columbus, Ohio, the 14th largest
US city, on a steamy night, in a place once called the Red Hook, where
one could clearly feel the poetic remains of sailors marketed through
the floorboards.

As with most poetry events, things started after the scheduled time,
although not to the usually poetically fashionable extreme. Somewhere
around 8:40pm after some intense socializing and working thru a general
notion of who, when and duration, the Pavement Saw pre-Second Wave
Reading opener & release party for Dan Zimmerman's first book, started.
This was my favorite type of MC situation as I had met all (except one)
of the reader's beforehand and threatened to tell some horrifically
embarassing story, but a brilliant reading would exhonerate them from my
tale. The room was tense.

A decent crowd, consisting of at least 40 during the opening lull,
listened on as Jesse Glass from Japan, the poet I was least familiar
with, read. I knew he had edited Die Young with Skip Fox in the early to
mid nineties and that his work was wide in range, from visual / concrete
poetry to narrative work praised by the American Book Review. Under
advisement from an intern, Sean Kearns, who picked Glass up from the
Hotel "man, he's coming in & out, bad jet lag, dude, I'd put him on
first" his slot was chosen, although I did not ever explain my choice in
person. The first poem Glass read was real fine, tho I did not hear the
name, and I appreciated his full set, the tight turns, the long breath
over short lines, the light humor always present with "Go Ha Ha Ha"
being my other favorite. The only one I found disagreeable "Honoring It"
might have had to do with my long meandering in this IT realm, reading
Stephen (who was in the audience) Ellis's _The long and Short of It_ for
a (unused) blurb, because I could not stop for humorous short jokes.
Jesse read for 20 to 30 minutes (I'm watchless), before I interrupted to
move on, as I was suddenly struck by how large this reading would be.

Michael Basinski read a rendition of Poe's "The bells," a poem that if
you have had the misfortune of deciding to teach in a literature class,
then his retitled "the Balls" jangled the ears quite differently. A
classic Bar poem, the Balls filled the audience with laughter. Basinski
is another wildly diverse writer, and each poem was a totally separate
entity, during his second I was harrassing some "employees" for money (I
work here, so do the four of them, I'm broke, those are some big rings
there, hey look I just found five dollars, etc.) missed the title & then
he did a piece on "three" which is the magic number, in which many
singular items, one being the loneliest, were made threes also.

Brian Richards did an uncharacteristic poem about being a bad man, an
unfortunate choice due to the all of out of towners hearing him for the
first time. This work seemed incomplete in compares to "Winged Zoe," or
"Talking at Teeny's" where the punctuation and exactness of juxtapostion
acquire the readers attention.

With the ability to hush the room quiet after a half dozen lines, Aralee
Strange did these wonderful doctor poems, reminiscent of Niedecker mixed
with WCW or Irby, & read in a southern drawl. Each of these pieces were
long, five to ten minutes, and the last two, concluding with "There is
no Meditating on the Ginko" from Ultimate Pavement Saw, kicked my ass
over time, still are, as good poems are wont to do. She briefly talked
about her film, THIS TRAIN, which stars Soupy Sales, and how the poems
are utilized. I was not only impressed with the reading but also chirped
that Sheila had a chance to hear her.

All readers from the first set read standing. In odd comparsion to the
rest of the conference, this had no visual component. I forgot to turn
on the cheap multicolored disco-ball in the corner.

____________Break________________

During the intermission, people moved around, I played host, fanning the
flame of jubilation, breaking the ice between many such & suches to
whoseshewhatsits that had grabbed my ear during the reading & said could
you introduce me to x. The biggest surprise of the evening for me was
finally meeting the former language poet Peter Ganick, as I had expected
a different individual from our phone conversations. He was much larger
and, while talkative, more quiteish than on the line. It did not seem
that he had any work on him, so rather than asking for a reading, I
resolved to hear him on Saturday. The owner, Abdi, was pleased & told me
extremely slowly especially considering all of the stimulants (cod(sp?))
he was on.

Set Two:

Daniel Zimmerman read sitting down, hunched over a batch of poems with a
fierce glare from his glasses & read a large selection from Post Avant
before going onto work from the British Frame Publications chapbook
Isotopes & then concluding with newer work including one from the new
Ultimate issue. In nice contrast to Aralee, his non-dramatic style
complemented the poems & was a solid, straight forward addition.

Stephen Mainard read three new poems, all were curt, concise and heavy
with imagery. One of them had to do with "the beautiful." He is also a
quiet reader but tall & read standing.

Steve Abbott read two jazz works in a loud, almost brash, voice. I
wanted to include some nearby writers, to show each other off & mingle,
a factor which was successful & well appreciated. One of Steves poems is
also in Ultimate.

Before introducing Sheila, I read three poems, Poem in which we are not
together, Poem in which unity exists and I think of of the water poems
tho I forget. Since I have a bias, I'll let others state how I did.

Sheila E. Murphy shifted her readings from Falling in Love Falling in
Love with you Syntax to Greatest Hits to The Stuttering of Wings over
and over again. I remember her reading "She's lovely on Prozac" and "A
portrait of Beverly C" I think she also read "Clothes Party Line" & a
piece about an Irish background (this is where I get fuzzy & forgetful,
help?) & I also remember she briefly pulled out Teth & did something not
in the selected & while I was hoping to hear how "club of trailer park
what ifs" would be aired it was not so. Sheila is in continual smiles
thru the eve & we had plenty of time to recover on Friday as things did
not start again till 3:30pm.

If others can supplement my memory, I'd greatly appreciate it for a more
accurate record--

Be well

Friday July 26, 2002

Friday was an odd warmer to the main day. While we enjoyed Dan
Zimmermans company, he left in the morning in a rush due to a banishing
spell performed the night before and at quarter of one I stopped down at
the bus station of the city in the US with the largest number of unfit
males according to CQ magazine (they know no writers here) walked up to
a person in the packed terminal & asked if he was Bob, he said yes, I
said from Florida?, the same answer & I said (hey ho) lets go. Columbus'
Greyhound station is horrific as midwesterners believe they can get
anywhere by bus and why should we be in hurry, were in Ohio. I took Bob
Grumman back to my house to feed & revive him from a 30 hour bus drive
with a special cold French rotini dish with a vegetarian chili combo.

We talked of things & while I was familiar with his review writing since
the late eighties when he worked on Factsheet Five (back when they
astoundingly published reviews of EVERY journal, tape, etc that
arrived), then moved to Taproot when they shifted to newspaper format,
then the short lived Small Magazine Review which was reconfigured back
into Small Press Review. I know he had written about us over the years &
had read plenty of his other evaluations but  had no idea about his
poetry. Bob is working on something admirable, a form of math that
divides one word into another using color & expresses the remainder in
words also, which, when seen in total, creates a page long poem
incorporating all of these leftover fractions (whole words) which are
then subsequently further divided. This mathmatico has many sharp
moments to it, which were displayed at his Saturday presentation.

For nearly the whole weekend one of our interns, Sean Kearns, was
present & he showed up at the house for free eats & a talk with Bob. We
left about 3pm & got there just in time. We might have missed a few
people, but right when we got there Basinski was doing a poem involving
all kinds of packing materials used at the same time by all poetry
inducing audience members. These were all short readings, my brief
memory had mIEKAL aND reading these letter type things, Igor Satanovsky
using a bullhorn to immediate effect on a 'Russian' poem which included
pseudo & stereotyped words of Russian import, Peter Ganick, Sheila E.
Murphy, John M. Bennett,  Lewis LaCook, John Byrum, Thom Taylor
(anabasis), Michael Peters, William Austin from a book (was it fiction?
couldn't tell), Jesse Glass, Bob Grumman, Brandon Barr, Irving Weiss,  &
Geoffrey Gatza (who arrived just over that thin line of fashion in
lateness). Most did three pieces or five minutes with continual prodding
from John MB who was trying to move visual artists to perform. I read
three Estrellas & had plenty of energy firing, interior out. If Ficus
Strangulensis, Carlos Luis,  Kathy Ernst, or Michael Magazinnik read I
missed it. This is not in order.

After, there was food, & I was able to see out of print collections of
mine, Pavement Saw's & others in the Exhibit Hall. Ficus' work that the
poster was made from was captivating and unexpected as the poster gave
no sense of a three dimensional object which contained so many
unphotographical tones dependent entirely on light source placement. A
person told me about the Delphic elements she found captured in Estrella
& I did a brief history on the fortune teller thru time from mythic to
human to non-representational mechanical to faux human & so on. I met
most, talked to all those met, ate plenty, walked in circles, invited
people to our cookout & made the rest up.

In the Grand Lounge of the OSU Faculty Club at 6:00 PM our contingent
sat near the back, working as trickster figures, in sentences such as
"I've only been invited to the regular lounge before,"  "these velvet
covered couches sure are comfy, they would look great on our porch" and
other memorable expressions of debouchery that people near us could tell
you about. I believe the president of the college said something but
since local papers or TV newshows are not allowed to show his picture or
likeness  so he doesn't end up dead, I am unsure if it was really him.
Shortly after, there was much rejoicing and a keynote address was given
by Marvin Sackner in which he gave a general overview of their
collection, & how him & Ruth started, using powerpoint. Marvin was
difficult to hear & some of the projector type size was unreadable. He
chose mostly work by presenters & seeing a hefty dose of Scott Helmes,
K. S. Ernst & Carlos Luis, along with Jesse Glass (who I was not
familiar with as a visual artist) was worth the aforementioned technical
problems. Some of Helmes' work I had seen before, & loved his chapbook
on Zelot Press (2 of the shown ones were similar to this, or else the
same ones!). They even showed a page from our Grenier 'book' without
knowing that we were in the audience. The Sackner Archive (all viz-po)
looked like a excellent visit, I would go to appreciate the Patchen
painted poems alone.

We went back to the house, dropped Bob G. off for the night, then went
back out with Stephen Mainard & Sean to the bookfair up at the hotel.
For its worth, our waitress was drunk. After successfully hawking our
wares, & good talks & trades with John Byrum, mIekal &, Igor, and a long
talk with Joel Lipman about his poemvelopes, which we stayed for nearly
an hour after the fair closed to view reproductions of, we went on our
way for short rest before our 6:30 am wakeup.

Be well

Yes, this is the line-up on the only album of hers I have, _Maintain
Control_.  Performing with Cortez, they call themselves the Firespitters.
Don't know much about the other work they've done.  I saw them live with
Cortez in Detroit in the late 80s, and they were definitely hot.

Another excellent Jayne Cortez and the Firespitters album is "There It Is"
(Bola Press, 1982).  The lineup is as follows: Jayne Cortez, Abraham
Adzenyah, Bill Coleshenai, Denardo Coleman, Farel Johnson Jr., Charles
Moffett Jr., Bern Nix, Jamaaladeen Tacuma.

Along the same lines as the music chat, what are people reading and
enjoying?  I've been knocked out lately by two books: Joyelle McSweeney's
THE RED BIRD (Fence) and Heather Fuller's DOVECOTE (Edge).
Two very different, very wonderful collections.

Been reading Albert Mobilio's Me With Animal Towering
and loving it! I'm teaching a course on experimental
poetics in the fall, charting 100 years of avant-garde
poetry in America. The first book is Tender Buttons
and the last is Me With Animal Towering...anyway, I
was very excited to find a great Village Voice article
Mobilio wrote on Stein a few years back. It'll be a
great circulatory ending for the course...

Jim,

I've been reading Borges' "This Craft of Verse," and
just last night I re-read Ron Padgett's "The Big
Something" which is wonderful.

What else?  Plato's "Gorgias," J.M. Synge's "Playboy
of the Western World," and Rushdie's "Midnight's
Children."

I have McSweeney's book, and my reaction is a bit
mixed...wonderful language throughout, but I'm one of
those old-fashioned guys who craves a somewhat-defined
emotional center.  Joyelle's book seems to be a series
of evasions of emotion.  But perhaps I'm wrong. I'd
really like to discuss the book, if you'd like to
backchannel me...or we can do it here on the list.
That said, I like it...but...

Best,
Tony

Wait, traveller
In this invisible fountain
Before you wet your tongue
Think, traveller of life
You also ooze out of the rocks
Only a water sprite
The thinking water does not flow forever
It dries in a moment of eternal time
Ah, a noisy jay
Sometimes from this water
A phantom man comes out holding up a flower
Seeking an eternal life is a dream
The murmuring stream of life flows away
Abandoning thought at last
Falling over the eternal cliff
Dreaming of disappearance
Are the words of a phantom, a water imp
Coming out of the water to the village and to the town
At the time of glowing waterweeds in the shadow of
Floating clouds

FYI.

----------------------

Native American Critic and Novelist Louis Owens Dies
July 30, 2002

Louis
Owens, an internationally acclaimed novelist and a scholar of Steinbeck
and Native American literature, died Thursday in Albuquerque at the age
of 54.

Considered the country's leading critical interpreter of Native American
literature, Owens received several top book awards for his fiction and scholarly
work, had his novels translated into other languages and most recently participated
in a lengthy interview on national television about his Steinbeck scholarship
during the centennial celebration of the Salinas Valley writer.

Owens was the author of five novels -- one of which, "Nightland,"
won the American Book Award in 1997, four books of literary criticism and
a new collection of essays, "I Hear the Train." His academic career
spanned two decades and five universities. Most recently, he was a professor
of English and Native
American studies at the University of California, Davis, and headed
the campus's Creative
Writing Program.

His colleagues described him as the rare literary polymath with expertise
as the leading critic of Native American literature, a major scholar in
mainstream American literature through his work on Steinbeck, and as an
award-winning novelist and non-fiction writer about Native Americans.

Gerald Vizenor, professor of American Studies at University of California,
Berkeley, and a national figure in Native American literature, said Owens
was the "most original scholar in critical theory" for Native
American literature.

"Louis Owens was an inspired, original literary artist, a masterful
storier, and he was an exceptional teacher," he said.

"His writing is really important in American literature, overall,"
said Luci Tapahonso, a Native American poet and professor of American Indian
studies and English at the University of Arizona, Tucson. "He challenged
people to rethink their approaches and touched on topics that hadn't been
considered before."

"Often academic departments do not hire their own; his coming back
was extraordinary, by any standard," said Hicks, pointing to Owens'
many accomplishments and accolades, including an invitation from Harvard
University to spend a year there in 2004 as a scholar-in-residence. Just
this spring, Owens' own work was the subject of a book, "Grave Concerns,
Trickster Turns: The Novels of Louis Owens," by Chris LaLonde.

Born in Lompoc, Calif., to migrant laborers, Owens spent his childhood
moving between Mississippi and the Central Valley, picking beans and living
in poverty. Owens has written of that period in an essay called
"Finding
Gene":

"My first memories are of Gene and jungle-like woods that grew thick
between our cabin and the deep-edged brown water of the Yazzoo River. Three,
4, 5, and 6 years old, I followed him everywhere, swinging on muskedine
vines and eating the acid-sweet purple fruit, climbing pecan trees that
we called pee-cans, fishing in the endless, muddy current of the river,
jumping in the wire-sided cotton trucks filled with white boles. The washtub
where I had to bathe in gray water after him, leaning toward the wood cook-stove
on cold Mississippi mornings. The log shed we'd check each morning to see
what skins our father had nailed up during the night."

Of the nine brothers and sisters in the Owens family, Louis and brother
Gene were the only two who completed high school and Louis was the only
sibling to go to college.

His mentor and major professor for his doctorate, UC Davis Professor
Emeritus James Woodress, said Owens was first drawn to the work of John
Steinbeck because he knew intimately the life and history of the Salinas
Valley. "Because Louis came from very poor parents who were farm laborers,
novels like 'The Grapes of Wrath' moved him a great deal," Woodress
said.

Owens' first book, "John Steinbeck's Re-Vision of America,"
was published in 1985, followed by "The Grapes of Wrath: Trouble in
the Promised Land" in 1989. In May he was the subject of a lengthy
interview on C-Span regarding John Steinbeck and his literary legacy.

Owens earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in English from UC Santa
Barbara before coming in 1978 to UC Davis for his doctorate. During graduate
school, Owens and his wife spent a year in Pisa while Owens taught at the
University of Pisa as a Fulbright Lecturer.

Throughout his career, Owens was known for being extraordinarily prolific.
Due to the number and quality of his publications, the time between his
receiving his doctorate and being promoted to full professor at UC Santa
Cruz was the shortest in the history of the University of California. Even
in graduate school, while not working on his Steinbeck dissertation, Owens
wrote his first novel, "Wolfsong," about copper strip-mining in
Washington State's Glacier Peak Wilderness, where he had worked as a ranger
and firefighter for the Forest Service.

It was through this first novel, published in 1991, that Owens explored
his Choctaw and Cherokee roots, said Hicks, a young assistant English professor
at UC Davis while Owens was attending graduate school.

"He told me he had a novel and asked if would I read it, and it
was then that I found he was Native American. Quite clearly, to write a
whole novel about one's heritage indicates it is alive in your life and
your imagination," Hicks said. "By the end of the first book,
being Native American was something that was alive for him."

Owens, who considered himself a mixed-blood American, explored the dilemmas
of being from multiple heritages through much of his writing -- both in
fiction and non-fiction. He won a Wordcraft Circle Writer of the Year Award
in 1998 for "Mixedblood Messages: Literature, Film, Family, Place."


Owens' academic reputation in Native American fiction started in 1985
with an article, "A Map of the Mind: Darcy McNickle and the American
Indian Novel," published in Western American Literature. He wrote many
articles on Native American fiction before publishing his 1992 book, "Other
Destinies: Understanding the American Indian Novel," which by now has
become required reading in many college literature classes. In 1993 he won
the PEN-Josephine Miles Awards for "Other Destinies" and his novel,
"The Sharpest Sight" (1992). He also was awarded with the Julian
J. Rothbaum Prize for his 1992 novel "Bone Game" in 1994.

In his novels, Owens said he wrote to two audiences: mainstream readers
and his Choctaw and Cherokee relatives. He wove in layers of Native American
metaphor and myth through his complex mystery plots, so that two stories
were being told at the same time.

One of the awards he displayed proudly in his office was the 1995 Roman
Noir Prize, a French award for the outstanding mystery novel published in
French given to "The Sharpest Sight." His novels were translated
into French, German and Japanese, and he appeared on French television more
than once.

Extraordinarily generous with his time and attention to students, Owens
was a dedicated teacher who mentored and encouraged his students and other
writers.

"He gave an incredible amount of time to his students, time spent
on reading and critiquing their work, time spent in meeting with them and
working out the myriad problems that are associated with the scholastic
life, and time offered in the spirit of camaraderie and friendship,"
said Spring Warren, a 2002 graduate of the UC Davis Creative Writing Program.

Among the many recognitions for teaching that he received were the University
of New Mexico Alumni Award for Teaching Excellence, the University of California
Santa Cruz Alumni Association Distinguished Teaching Award, the UCSC Student
Alumni Council Favorite Professor Award, and the Outstanding Teacher of
the Year Award from the International Steinbeck Society. He was a Presidential
Lecturer at the University of New Mexico for two years.

From 1992 to 2000, Owens served on the faculty of UC Davis' Art of the
Wild, a summer writing workshop on nature and the environment that drew
nationally acclaimed writers. Owens was featured on a PBS one-hour special
about the workshop.

Owens is survived by his wife of 27 years, Polly; and his daughters,
Elizabeth, 19, and Alexandra, 16, all of Tijeras, N.M.; his father Hoey;
his brothers Gene, Troy and Richard; and his sisters Judy, Linda, Juanita,
and Brenda.

A campus memorial service is being planned for fall quarter.

Jim, agreed - DOVECOTE is my favorite book of the year, just amazing.
Also recently striking me:

Judith M. Green, DEEP DEMOCRACY: Community, Diversity and Transformation
(Rowan & Littlefield, 1999).  Very interesting, in the tradition of
Radical Prgamatism ala William James or Alain Locke, John Dewey etc.

Jennifer MOxley's THE SENSE RECORD (Edge), which has really been
challenging  my biases re avant-form.

And the one I mentioned last week, Neidecker's amazing COLLECTED

Nate Mackey's ATET AD

And as for music (which was the last thread yes?):

Tim Berne's new album (name escapes me just now and the disc is in my car)
which is a 100% written composition but which nonetheless sounds like
Ornette meets World Saxophone Quartet meets DJ Shadow.  Strange indeed and
begs interesting questions re improvisation as a prerequisite to out-jazz
etc.

And revisiting (always nice to revisit!): The Breeder's POD. Worth it for
the cover of "Happiness is a Warm Gun" alone but there's lots of great
stuff including the tune "Oh."

POD is fantastic.  "Oh!" indeed.  "Fortunately Gone,"
"Iris"....wow. Haven't heard it in years.

The Moving Target Series
2331 Mission St. btw 19th and 20th, San Francisco
(415) 515-1210 for tix/ (415) 584-7415 for press

Wednesdays in September

September 11: 911 (one year later)
Six young men who feel deeply about their country offer a stirring tribute
and testimonial on this most tragic of days. The Blue Room welcomes the
White Ring for a star-spangled extravaganza that will be an inspiration to
some, a warning to others, and a revelation to all. Are they Heroes? Or jus=
t
ordinary, Red-Blooded Americans standing up for their God-given Rights in
these Troubled Times?
The White Ring met while stationed in Kuwait during the Gulf War in 1990.
Through the common link of music, and a shared message of strength and hope
through politics and melody, they have remained active collaborators since.
They are widely known for their riveting stage seminars which skillfully
blend their own brand of music, testimonials and dramatic representations o=
f
the problems we face as a "progressive" society today. They have challenged
even the thickest-skinned audiences both domestically and in the Third Worl=
d
with their mix of powerful messages. They have been well received in the
Indie Christian rock scene and released one of the earliest examples of
"East Bay I.C." records in 1993 ("The Monkey Song" b/w "Ecumenical
Movement"), but have also enjoyed unprecedented crossover into the
underground circuit of America's more subversive, experimental music venues=
.
In 2001, they were named Best Result of Operation Desert Storm by SF Weekly
in their annual "Best of San Francisco" awards issue. Also on the bill is a
rare local appearance by church folk hero Pastor Dick.  Dick is best known
for his work with local "culture jammers" Negativland, though his messages
are often at odds with the more "humanist" approach of that famous Contra
Costa group.


September 18: Bad
Poetasters and laity alike have endured the stultifying experience of a bad
poetry reading at one time or another =96 and then there are those who=92d say
they=92re all bad. But what happens when the Bay Area=92s best poets convene to
find out just how bad they can be? Sifting through their own notebooks as
well as the annals of Literature, these poets promise to do their Worst.
With Kevin Killian, Bill Berkson, Beth Lisick, Andrew Felsinger, kari
edwards, Norma Cole,  Sean Finney,  hosts Michael Smoler and David
Hadbawnik, and more "bad" authors to come.
kari edwards is a poet, artist and gender activist, winner of New Langton
Art=92s Bay Area Award in Literature(2002), author of a day in the life of p.
to be released by Subpress Collective (2002), a diary of lies =96 Belladonna
#27 by Belladonna Books (2002), Electric Spandex: anthology of writing the
queer text, by Pyriform Press (2002), and post/(pink) by Scarlet Press
(2001) . Between '92-'93, Beth Lisick would come home from her job as a
baker, drink a bottle of wine and try to write poems about what it was like
being a baker with a drinking problem. Kevin Killian is a San Francisco
novelist, poet, art writer, critic and playwright.  His books include
Bedrooms Have Windows, Shy, Little Men, Arctic Summer, and Argento Series.
Killian's most recent book is I Cry Like a Baby, a collection of stories,
memoirs and theoretical pieces. Bill Berkson has taught at the San Francisc=
o
Art Institute since 1984. He studied at Brown University, the New School,
Columbia University and New York University's Institute of Fine Arts. He is
the author of 11 books and pamphlets of poetry, including Red Devil, Start
Over and Lush Life. His work has been included in many literary journals an=
d
anthologies. Berkson is a contributing writer to Artforum and other
publications, and is a corresponding editor for Art in America. Sean Finney
is a poet and journalist living in Oakland. He recieved an MFA from Brown
University and has been published in Oblek and Lingo. His last reading was
not officially bad. His interests include embarrasment, planning, and
complete end-to-end n-tier ebusiness solutions. Norma Cole is a poet,
painter and translator. Her most recent poetry publication is Spinoza in He=
r
Youth (Omnidawn Press). SCOUT, a text/image
work, is forthcoming from Krupskaya Editions in CD-ROM format. Among her
poetry books are MARS, MOIRA and Contrafact.

September 25: What I Did Last Summer
Ah, autumn in San Francisco=85 when warm sun finally breaks through summer
fog, and friends convene over glasses of wine to discuss their summer
adventures. In this case, who knows what revelations might come out? Justin
Veach shares the strange ocular power he=92s been developing over the sultry
Los Angeles summer, while James Bewley invites the creatures he encountered
in the California wilderness to help relate his tale, and Blevin Blectum
offers an aural report on her experiences.
Blevin Blectum aka Bevin Kelley is an electronic musician based in Oakland.
She recently released her second solo album Talon Slalom on Deluxe Records.
Her first album Pirate Planets came out in 1999 on Phthalo Records under th=
e
name d84. As half of Blectum from Blechdom, she released several CDs and
vinyl recordings including "The Messy Jesse Fiesta" (Deluxe), a top prize
winner at the 2001 Ars Electronica. James Bewley is a writer, performer, an=
d
curator living in Oakland. Since moving to the Bay Area, he has performed
his own performance work at several local venues including Caf=E9 Du Nord, Th=
e
Exploratorium, The Lab, Sonoma State University, and Works/San Jose.   As a
writer and performer with the sketch comedy group Killing My Lobster, Bewle=
y
has traveled to Los Angeles, Seattle, and Chicago to perform in comedy
festivals and industry showcases. Recently Bewley was a visiting faculty
member at the Rhode Island School of Design where he received his BFA in
Sculpture in 1997.  Bewley is the Program Director at New Langton Arts. Los
Angeles-based artist Justin Veach exists somewhere between art critic and
poet, performance artist and stand-up comedian.  He holds a B.A. in Writing
& Poetics and InterArts Studies from NaropaUniversity.

*        *        *        *        *        *

The Moving Target Series, San Francisco=92s ongoing, roving presentation of
performance, music, film, and movement, returns with a visit to The Blue
Room for the month of September. Since 1999, the series (formerly curated b=
y
David Hadbawnik with Margaret Tedesco, now with Michael Smoler) has travele=
d
to such disparate venues as 848 Community Space, Z Space, The Luggage Store=
,
111 Minna Street, New Langton Arts, and The Lab, treating audiences to the
best performance in the Bay Area. Moving Target has featured a wide variety
of artists including The Foundry, Ruth Zaporah, Mads Lynnerup, Remy Charlip=
,
Fred Frith, Negativland, Diane di Prima, Michelle Tea, Beth Lisick, and man=
y
others.

re-reading Consciousness Explained by Daniel C. Dennet... a completely fascinating work on the nature of consciousness, bypassing the reductionist/wholistic dichotomy and filled with great reports of experiments that challenge traditional notions of perception.

Syntactically Impermenance (Scalapino) and Pierce-Arrow (Howe)

Healing from Within with Chi Nei Tsang by Gilles Marin... a companion to studying Qigong.

Design Patterns (GoF)... a software design book that builds on the idea of patterns (as applied to architecture) by Christopher Alexander in A Pattern Language... "Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice." -- it seems that literary manifestos may be a notational form of poetic patterns.

And, just tonight:
http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/freeculture/
    -- required reading/listenging for anyone interested in the culture of creative thought.

Arielle,

as far as the course, it's really just the usual
suspects:

Wiliams: Kora in Hell...
Stein: Tender Buttons...
   (both these to talk about meaning and syntax)
Ashbery: Tennis Court...
   ( how does one more from avant-grade to academic
approval)
The New American Poetry
  ( what are the effects of poetic categorization)
The Poetics of Indeterminacy
  (this is nice as it has chapters on Kora in Hell and
Tender Buttons and a good deal of the intro is devoted
to Ashbery)
I decided on the Norton Anthology of Post-Modern
American Poetry
(the great sun & moon one is sadly out of print!)
might use Berrigan's Sonnets, not sure
Me With Animal Towering, as I said...
and a reader w/ lots & lots of photocopied essays,
poems and whatnot, things like Mayor's list of writing
experiments, the Black Took Collective article from
Fence, etc.

Once I put the reader together if anyone's interested
I'd let 'em know what exactly went in it; as it stands
I've got a huge pile of books stacked up, amounting to
around 500 pages with what I want to copy. I might
just do it anyway and assign each student a different
article to read and present to the class. They'll have
more at their fingertips that way...

the course meets once a week and is going to be half
practice, half theory/history...

It's really about exposure as far as I'm concerned.
When I was an undergrad I had almost no exposure
to--for lack of a better term--the Donald Allen side
of American poetry...I'm just hoping to offer up a
sort of door to the vastness of what's out there. I
realize it's quite reductive to compress the history
of avant-garde poetries into those few works, but at
least they're still getting read...

noah

touch me there.

8 i am frightened of everything. the wires expand and burn against
my tongue. they form the character for interval. they form the character

Folks:
Townes Van Zandt has been mentioned several times. Listen then to "Golden
Age of Radio" by Josh Ritter, a Moscow, Idaho kid now living in Boston whose
songwriting has drawn more than one comparison to Van Zandt. Especially
listen-worthy: me & jiggs; lawrence, ks; harrisburg; and the title song,
golden age of radio. I also cannot get enough of "The Dreams and Prayers of
Isaac the Blind" by Osvaldo Golijov (performed by Kronos Quartet). You've
got to "hear" the ending. It simply disappears, dissolves, the questions
raised by the piece (structural and thematic) left unanswered. Who says
classical music has to have closure?

Summer catches me up on journals as well as books. I've been reading spunky
back issues of Skanky Possum; the second issue of a very promising mag,
Antennae; the premier poetry journal from Italy, Offerta Speciale (visual
and verbal poetry from around the world); the always superbly focused
Samizdat, and an energetic visual poetry mag out of Maine, Farrago. Thanks
to Gary Sullivan's excellent alphabetic list of magazines on-line, I have
also pleasurably roasted my eyes reading many more magazines off the screen
(I've gotten through "H."). Summer also allows me to lurk on this list and
others (rather than simply delete, alas).

Books? I will entusiastically share: "so the ants made it to the catfood" by
Anselm Hollo; "20 Lines A Day" by Harry Mathews, "Forms of Distance" by Bei
Dao, "Mind in Society" by Lev Vygotsky, hand-in-hand with "The Dialogic
Imagination" by M. Bakhtin.

Best, Crag Hill

albums that I have listened to in the last week...

  categories

    very recently recorded electronic music getting complicated and
psychedelic:

      -The Return of Fenn O'Berg - Christian Fennesz, Peter Rehberg, Jim
O'Rourke (Mego)
      -Blinfolder - Adaptation (more electronic music, this album I just
recorded two weeks ago)
      -matmos live with j lesser (called "drug opera" on the cover)


    more straight up electronica:

      -Japanese Telecom - Japanese Telecom


    Searching for beats:

      -Afrika Bambaata - Looking for the Perfect Beat
      -Ornette Coleman- The Belgrade Concert


    when the music itself is just one part of a multivariate need to listen:

I love it when the reading lists loop around.  Anthony, I've just read
Giorgias too, and was especially struck by the assertions on rhetoric --
designed to produce pleasure and conviction but not to morally educate, etc.

Late to the table on this one, too: have just been reading Braudel's
Afterthoughts on Material Civilization and Capitalism for a piece I'm
working on involving 16th-century Lowlands -- and wonder if someone might
advise how, discipline-wise, his distinctions between capitalism and the
market have held up? The project's brought me to some fascinating other
reads, too -- an economist, John H. Munro's papers on the cost of goods in
Brabant in the period; Erasmus's Praise of Folly. Where was I when I had
the option of taking European history?

Audio-wise, I've been listening on walks and driving to McEwen's Atonement.
Fascinating how he enacts and demolishes the 19th century novel at once,
but I keep thinking the film version will be pure cheese.

Anyone have any experience with constructionist/relativist theories like
'discursive psychology' or 'social representations theory,' or
'perceptual-cognitivism'?

Cognition as a feature/construction of practice? Collective natures of
sense-making? Theories of action? The way cognition is understood and
related to practice?

How do these theories separate from more traditional views of emergent
signifier and signified, (or objectivity), which I may have learned in
literary-criticism texts? Are these representation-theories nothing more
than cognitive-reductionism?

Why are these disciplines strongly Euro-based, and hardly found in North
America?

I need a crash-course, and wonder if anyone knows enough to endorse the
above theories, so that I might further pursue them, or should I just
shrug them off?

Is language, or representation, the better model?

I've been on quite a buying spree lately and have many new and
terrific books of poetry, so I'll only mention a few gems here:

The Fall of Because, David Baratier (Pudding House, 1999).
Wonderful, spinning narratives. Great to read to friends who drop by.

Method, Mark Salerno (The Figures, 2002).
These "sonnet-like" poems are so deeply linked and antic that I'll
never discern the structure . . . but I'll always enjoy the product.

Source Codes, Susan Wheeler (Salt, 2001).
Again a book of linked things . . . and a book that will yield as little or
as much as you're willing to allow. On my third reading I'm still
finding worthy things.

Poetry, Language, Thought, Martin Heidegger (Harper, 1971).
Hmm. A book I put off reading for several years. I find several things
in here spot on . . . and several things I doubt I'll ever be able to
unpack. But it's fun slogging through.

And the book that I keep returning to, and have for some time now,
the excellent Your Name Here, by John Ashbery (FSG, 2000). After
such a long time of writing, his poems are as fresh as someone's just
coming into a subject. I just love it.

All great, beautiful books.

Best,

Larry Rivers, Who Shook Up American Art, Is Dead at 78
By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN


arry Rivers, the irreverent, proto-Pop painter and sculptor, jazz
saxophonist, writer, poet, teacher, sometime actor and filmmaker, whose
self-styled, partly self-mocking bad boy persona encapsulated the spirit of
a restless era that shook up American art, died on Wednesday at his home in
Southampton, on Long Island. He was 78.

The cause was cancer of the liver, which was diagnosed this spring.

Insecure, an avid reader and lover of poetry, a publicity hound, Mr. Rivers
was given in his glory days to cowboy boots, tight pants, inside-out shirts,
far-out ties, sometimes two at a time, a black Cadillac and motorcycle.

He helped change the course of American art in the 1950's and '60's, but his
virtues as an artist always seemed inextricably bound up with his vices,
producing work that could be by turns exhilarating and appalling. Naturally,
it provoked extreme reactions. Jackson Pollock, Mr. Rivers recalled with a
certain bitter glee, "once tried to run down one of my sculptures that was
standing in a friend's driveway in East Hampton."

He had an omnivorous curiosity about life, sex, drugs, politics, history and
culture. "He would stab out at different things, like Picasso, except that
more of Picasso's things worked out," said David C. Levy, the Corcoran
Gallery of Art's director and a longtime friend, who played with Mr. Rivers
in the East 13th Street Band. "Larry had a realistic sense of who he was, so
he didn't get caught up in his ego when things failed. At the same time he
was probing. He was a very serious man, an intellectual, always reading."

He had a sometimes self-destructive penchant for gossip, scandal and
outlandishness. "If I have inherited bad taste," he once said, "it is at
least compounded with an obnoxious sense of who I am." For a while he was
everywhere. He frequented the Cedar bar with de Kooning. He designed sets
for Frank O'Hara's "Try! Try!" and for "The Slave and the Toilet" by Amiri
Baraka. His sets and costumes for a New York Philharmonic performance of
Stravinsky's "Oedipus Rex" conducted by Lukas Foss outraged music critics.

He appeared with Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg in Robert Frank and Alfred
Leslie's offbeat film "Pull My Daisy," and played Lyndon Johnson on stage in
Kenneth Koch's "Election." With Pierre-Dominique Gaisseau, he spent six
months making a television travelogue about Africa before being arrested as
a suspected white mercenary in Lagos, Nigeria, and nearly being executed.
Broadcast in 1968 on NBC's "Experiments in Television," the show was summed
up by Barbara Delatiner in Newsday as "something like a Rivers canvas:
complex, brilliantly colorful and maybe too tongue-in-cheek for serious
consideration."

In 1958, he even won $32,000 on "The $64,000 Challenge" quiz show as an art
expert. He subsequently said he was slipped an envelope beforehand with the
questions in it but proudly declined to look.

In his last decades, commercially successful and churning out huge,
multimedia works, bloated pastiches of himself and other artists, he fell
hard from grace. But at the height of his fame, in the mid-1960's, John
Canaday, the New York Times chief art critic, called him "the cleverest,
even the foxiest, painter at work in the country," an artist who "can do
anything he wants with a brush."

That was amazing since Mr. Rivers had come to art almost by accident. As a
young saxophonist in a band playing the resort circuit in Maine in 1945, he
was shown a book about modern art one day by the band's pianist, Jack
Freilicher.

"I wanted to say, `What's cubism?" ' Mr. Rivers recalled in his
autobiography, "What Did I Do?" "But suddenly I knew what cubism was. Cubism
told a young man from the Bronx he didn't know very much. Cubism didn't know
about him or his nights walking all over Greenwich Village with his big horn
slung over his shoulder looking for a joint where he could sit and blow with
a lot of other desperados. Cubism certainly didn't smoke pot or get high,
cubism was history in which he played no part. Where could I catch up?"

Freilicher's wife was Jane Freilicher, a painter. She handed Mr. Rivers a
brush. He turned out to have a natural gift. "After a week or two I began
thinking that art was an activity on a `higher level' than jazz," he said.

Through Jane Freilicher, he met Nell Blaine, who was working in a
semiabstract style. She suggested he enroll in Hans Hofmann's class, which
Mr. Rivers did on the G.I. Bill. He played the saxophone at night and drew
eight hours a day, absorbing Hofmann's theories about color and form but
rebelling against his stress on pure abstraction, which was becoming the
dominant mode of American art at a time when Pollock and Rothko were
emerging as major figures on the scene.

Drawing female nudes in Hofmann's studio in 1947, Mr. Rivers recalled, he
ended up with three peculiar rectangles. "You were not supposed to make
notice of the fact that you were staring at a vagina," he said. "The art
mood of the times dictated that we not recognize a personal sexual reaction
as important." By the end of the year he "became frantic to draw the
figure."

A Bonnard show at the Museum of Modern Art in 1948 pointed a way forward.
Mr. Rivers saw that painting figures was not a dead occupation. He began
exhibiting the next year. Clement Greenberg, the powerful critic, called him
"an amazing beginner," a "better composer of pictures than was Bonnard
himself in many instances." (Greenberg later changed his mind and decided
Mr. Rivers "stinks.")

Mr. Rivers then went to Europe, living in Paris for a few months, where he
studied Old Masters, Courbet and Manet. After he returned, he painted
"Washington Crossing the Delaware" (1953), a deadpan parody of the salon
classic by Emanuel Leutze. He said he was stimulated by Tolstoy's retelling
of a national epic in "War and Peace." "I wanted to take something corny and
bring it back to life," he said.

It reintroduced to American painting a comic tone that the Abstract
Expressionists conspicuously lacked. They were not amused. But the work,
audacious and clever, the pigments dilute, the space diaphanous and
indeterminate, in an ambiguous style that subtly honored past art and
modernism while poking fun at both of them, was bought by the Modern and
helped pave the way for Pop artists, and their irony, at the end of the
1950's.

Mr. Rivers was never strictly a Pop painter himself, however. His
unconventionality was particularly idiosyncratic, with elements of
underground camp, a touch of nostalgia and a sub-current of tragedy. He was
a superb draftsman in the tradition of Degas or Manet, but with an odd
tendency toward bravado and self-parody. After "Washington Crossing the
Delaware" he painted a lifesize homoerotic portrait of O'Hara nude with
boots on. O'Hara was his friend, supporter, occasional lover and
collaborator. (Mr. Rivers collaborated with various poets over the years.)

A favorite subject was his mother-in-law, Berdie Burger, nude, her flesh
sagging, a Rubensian figure. Mr. Rivers said he felt competitive with the
Old Masters. He wanted to prove he could paint figures as well as Gericault.
His work spoke to old-fashioned ambitions thrust up against a modern world
that seemed to have lost faith in them.

But it could be so extreme that it was not clear — not even to him, perhaps
— whether the result was meant to be, as one critic put it, "therapeutic or
traumatic." De Kooning in his obscure but precise way once said that looking
at Mr. Rivers's art was "like pressing your face in wet grass," which summed
up the mixture of sensations it could provoke.

In the 80's, when Mr. Rivers went into the hospital briefly after his heart
started fibrillating, he imagined his obituary in The New York Times. "Will
it begin at the bottom of the front page, `Genius of the Vulgar Dies at 63'
" he asked, "continued inside with one of The Times's awful photos of me and
the usual reference to the name my parents gave me?"

He was born Yitzroch Loiza Grossberg on Aug. 17, 1923, (although he also
claimed to be born in 1925), to Jewish immigrants from the Ukraine. His
father was a plumber who became the owner of a small trucking firm. Mr.
Rivers recalled working for his father, pushing handcarts through the
garment district. He studied piano and fell in love with jazz. A year before
his bar mitzvah, he was playing the saxophone on the Borscht Belt circuit in
the Catskills. Later, when a comic introduced him and his band as Larry
Rivers and the Mudcats, he changed his name.

In 1942, over his family's objections, he enlisted in the United States Army
Air Corps, and was inducted into the Army band, then honorably discharged
because of a tremor in his left hand. He enrolled at Juilliard and studied
composition in a class with Miles Davis. They would prepare for exams "by
going outside to smoke some marijuana," he said. "We were convinced it would
improve our hearing." Through Davis, who was living with Charlie Parker, he
met other jazz musicians. He began to tour with various groups.

After the war, he married Augusta Burger, the mother of a toddler son,
Joseph, whom he later adopted. They had another son, Steven, then divorced.
Mr. Rivers raised the boys. O'Hara called the home he set up a "bohemian
household" of "staggering complexity." It included Joseph, Steven and
Augusta's mother, Berdie, his favorite model until she died in 1957. "She
was very easy to live with," Mr. Rivers said. "Nothing threw her. I mean
here she was from a very ordinary Jewish background, born in Harlem when
Harlem was still Jews, and there were gay guys in my life, and black people
and dope addicts, and she would say, `Oh, isn't he nice . . . he's nice . .
. Tennessee Williams is nice.'

"She was slightly mad."

He would return home to the Bronx, his sister Geri recalled (he quoted her
in "What Did I Do?"), "in this long overcoat with his strange haircut,
saying a lot of things no one understood, telling weird jokes without a
punch line and using a lot of `hey man, you dig, man, go, man.' Mamma was
beginning to learn how to read and write English in the Communist Party
night school when Larry comes around talking black talk."

He needed odd jobs to support himself. Once, he became Jack Harris, Famous
Artist, to demonstrate ballpoint pens at Hearns Department Store on 14th
Street, and also worked as a messenger for Philip Rosenthal, an art-supply
house on Broadway, making cashless transactions on the sly to keep his own
studio well-stocked.

By the 60's, his reputation and notoriety at a peak, he was experimenting
widely. The work could be vulgar or lofty. He made sculptures out of plaster
casts and welded metal. His "Lampman Loves It" was a sculpture of a couple
engaged in intercourse. He collaborated with Jean Tinguely and Yves Klein in
Europe. His paintings touched on racial issues, as in works like "The Last
Civil War Veteran," "Lynching" and "Black Olympia." He once reconstructed a
Harlem tenement front stoop with trash cans from which emanated taped
screams and shouts of a family killing a rat.

He incorporated more and more everyday things, found objects and popular
images into his art, famously using the Dutch Masters cigar box label, based
on Rembrandt's "Syndics," in a 1960's series, but also complicating his work
with stencils and other lettering devices.

His "History of the Russian Revolution" (1965) was a 33-foot, 76-panel
project, which his sons helped him build, based on his reading of a
biography of Trotsky, made up of boxes, paintings, drawings, a poem, an
honor roll, lead pipes, wooden rifles and a machine gun. Mr. Rivers called
it "the greatest painting-sculpture-mixed media of the 20th century, or the
stupidest."

He went on to make images about the Holocaust, and homages to Hollywood. In
the 1980's, he undertook a series after Duchamp's "Nude Descending a
Staircase," did nine Op-Ed illustrations for The Times, including one of
"Reagan Crossing the Caribbean" at the time of the war in Grenada, and, when
commissioned to paint the story of the Jews from Moses to Theodore Herzl,
produced the three-part "History of Matzo." "In Jewish history," he said,
"there's a humorous way of looking at things."

Splitting his time between art and music, he played the saxophone with
several bands in later years, touring successfully until he died. His
daughter Gwynne sometimes sang with him. His East 13th Street Band made
commercial recordings in the 80's and early 90's. His last group was called
the Climax Band.

He is survived by Clarice, a Welsh-born teacher he married in 1961; they
were separated but remained married and on friendly terms. He is also
survived by their daughters, Gwynne Rivers and Emma Rivers, both of New York
City, his sons, Joseph Rivers, of Pleasant Valley, N.Y., Steven Rivers, of
Nyack, N.Y., and Sam Deshuk Rivers, his son with Daria Deshuk, a painter he
lived with for 10 years. Both of them live in New York City. There are eight
grandchildren.

His two sisters, Geri Block and Joan Gordon, both of Southampton, also
survive him. For the last five years, he lived with Jeni Olin, a poet.

A critic once claimed that "the innovations of Rauschenberg and to a lesser
degree Johns and the Pop artists are incomprehensible without Rivers."
Maybe. It is at least true that Mr. Rivers helped bridge the gulf between
Abstract Expressionism and the mass imagery of Pop. At a time when sly
figure painting is now back in fashion, his early work seems remarkably
fresh and prescient. His willingness to take chances was in the end perhaps
his finest quality.

About his later unevenness, he said: "I keep shifting my interests. I can
have a few months when I have visions of the Holocaust, and then, the next
few months I'm suddenly doing something that might be considered trite. Like
fashion. Though I really can't make much sense of it, except for the
continuation of the absurd in art.

"I go from this to that, and why be ashamed of it? It seems to me this is
the human experience."

Born in 1923 in the Bronx, New York, as Larry Grossberg. In 1940 he began a
musical career as a jazz saxophonist and changed his name to Larry Rivers.
In 1943 he was declared medically unfit for military service. Until 1945 he
worked as a saxophonist in various jazz bands in the New York area. In
1944-45 he studied theory of music and composition at the Juilliard School
of Music, New York. His first encounter with fine art was through a musical
motif based on a painting by Georges Braque. He began painting in 1945. In
1947-48 he studied at the Hans Hofmann School. In 1948 he studied under
William Baziotes at New York University and met Willem de Kooning. In 1949
he had his first one-man exhibition at the Jane Street Gallery, New York. In
1951 he graduated in art from New York University and met Jackson Pollock.
His works were subsequently shown by John Myers until 1963. In 1952 he
designed the stage set for Frank O'Hara's play "Try! Try!". In 1953 he
completed Washington Crossing the Delaware. In 1954 he had his first
exhibition of sculptures at the Stable Gallery, New York. In 1956 he began a
series of large-format paintings and was included with ten other American
artists in the IV. Bienal Do Museu de Arte Moderna de São Paulo, Brazil. In
1958 he spent a month in Paris and played in various jazz bands. He also
collaborated with the poet Kenneth Koch on the collection of picture-poems
New York 1959-1960. In 1961 he married Clarice Price, an art and music
teacher of Welsh extraction. In 1965 he had his first comprehensive
retrospective in five important American museums. His final work for the
exhibition was The History of the Russian Revolution. Until 1967 he was in
London collaborating with Howard Kanovitz. In 1967 he became separated from
his wife Clarice. He travelled in Central Africa and made the TV-documentary
Africa and I with Pierre Gaisseau. In 1969 he began to use spray cans, in
1970 the air brush, and later, video tapes. In 1972 he taught at the
University of California in Santa Barbara. In 1973 he had exhibitions in
Brussels and New York. In 1974 he finished his japan series. He was
represented at the documenta "6", Kassel, in 1977. In 1978 he began his
Golden Oldies Series, revising his own works of the fifties and sixties. In
1980-81 he was given his first European retrospective at Hanover, Munich and
Berlin.

One of Rivers' best (and to me most moving) performances
was his intense heartfelt oration at O'Hara's funeral....
I only hope someone will do him similarly well....

The 165 Character Manifesto


All too often, we hear that postmodernity has eliminated, or at least
called into question, the relationship of natural world, wilderness, to
manageriality. This is prefabricated on assumption no longer can nature be
taken for granted, in-itself primordial. Instead, world fabricated,
constructed, managed, undergoing continuous cultural transformation -
augmented by global communications systems.

I wish propose an 'other hand,' however - one based both atmosphere and
cosmos. Clearly, atmospheric pollution, stratospheric extends vertically;
doubts it reaches ionospheric levels, even if so, inaccessibly-high finite
vastness universe beckons beyond.

Consider this, then consider traumas earth itself earthquakes other
'natural disasters,' latter hurricanes example human activity. From above,
from below, volcanos, magmas held taut within mesh universal chaos.

Human encroach; have not yet contaminated stars, earth-orbital trash
infinitesimal danger, compared errant asteroid.

The point? That artificial are porous, species-dependent terms, sun
clearly indicative our own miserable fabrications... There remains
wilderness preserved, avoid this uncomfortable conclusion 'annihilation
limit' seems a far easier, almost comfortable, way, deal with what appears
slaughter...

Sad news.  Rivers was outrageous and I loved him for it.  His Washington
Crossing the Delaware remains one of my favorite pieces.  Surrounded by
abstractionists, Rivers, always the misanthrope, went the other way.  A true
innovator, he proved that referential painting could be reinvented.  His
hybrid, abstract/figurative, works placed him both inside and outside the
pack.  And a talented pack it was.  For my money his work evinces the rarest
of all aesthetic qualities--originality.  Travel clean, Larry.  Best, Bill

!
I'm wondering if Joel Weishaus' beautiful quote from Hindemith reveals some
familiarity with the book I mentioned, "The Physics of Immortality" by Frank
J. Tipler.  Tipler's eccentric thesis is that millions of years from now, as
predicted in biblical scriptures, everyone that ever existed will be
resurrected. Tipler, according to a close friend of mine who was the head of
the CCNY philosophy department for many years, and whose area is the history
of science, told me that Tipler is a very respected scientist whose earlier
books were eagerly read by nearly every contemporary physicist. Tipler
believes that someday cybernetics will be so advanced that that this
resurrection activity will be a cinch for the Omega Point, a God-like force
that will remember and reproduce everyone that ever existed. How's that for
"the democratization of the found"?

As for the internet, perhaps the origin of quotes will be more known than
ever. After all, isn't the internet is the ultimate success of
alphabetization? I am not so sure that cyberspace is leading toward a middle
ages form of collective anonymity. But isn't it pretty to think so?

PS on Books and Music

I'm listening to a lot of Haydn String Quartets (I like the Lindsays best).
Also rereading every word of George Orwell (started this before 9/11). Right
now: "The Road to Wigan Pier" and "Animal Farm". Also, "We", the classic
Russian science fiction novel by Yevgeny Zamyatin, which was written between
1921 and 1922 and not published in Russia until 1952. Zamyatin was exiled
under Stalin and died in Paris in 1937. "We", which envisions a world where
everyone is given a number or a letter instead of a name, was a major source
of inspiration for both Orwell's "1984" and Huxley's "Brave New World." I'm
also reading the abovementioned "Physics of Immortality"

Otherwise, roaming around here on the Cape reading pebbles on the beach,
listening to the music of the waves.

I have Sam Hunter's giant and wonderful LARRY RIVERS book in front of me
(picked it up thru Hamilton on remainder last year for 14 bucks!)
Whatever problems art critics may have with him, Rivers always blows me
away with his skill and, especially, his audacity.  Even, for instance, in
the period that produced such pieces as "Heroes of Chushingura" (which
don't really do it for me) I'm knocked out by his willingness to try, it
seems, *anything* - treating whatever happens in the course of
art-making/thinking as revelation, to paraphrase Duncan.  The proto-pop
pieces of the 60s are, to my mind, more interesting than most pop art,
since they treat popular materials the way a jazz musician might,
integrating them with many other visual languages.  It's this sort of
polyvisual impulse which I keep returning to.  Unofficial autobiography
indeed!  Another sad, but triumphant, departure.     -m.

Thanks for all the responses. Anastasios's pairing of Louis Armstrong and
Django Reinhardt convinced me to buy a CD of the latter (any particular
recording to start with?), and Gary Sullivan's wonderful essay made me think
"this is what a list is all about" (I'll check out the links), and K.Silem's
selections made me think that he and I probably have a lot in common.

Not meaning to perpetuate the thread, but --  Here are a few more things
I've been listening to lately, followed by a simple digest of the posts thus
far;

- Bartok - Miraculous Mandarin
- Luna "Romantica" (highly recommended)
- Trojan DJ collection - (reggae)
- Housemartins "London O Hull 4"
- Bob Wills (everything)
- Mozart piano sonatas (see "The Man Who Wasn't There")
- Mahler symphonies (various, esp 4 & 6)

Two novels I've read recently

"The Tutor" by Peter Abrahams, possibly the best suspense novel I've
read since Ira Levin's "Sliver."

"At Swim Two Boys," by --hmmm, now I can't remember his name!  He's
from Ireland and his first name is Jamie.  Anyhow I didn't want to
read this book thinking it was all going to be terribly naff--but it
is terrific!!  It's a long book but reads very quickly, after a few
chapters you won't put it down till you're all done.  It's the story
of the Easter Rising in Dublin 1916 against the backdrop of the
concurrent Great War & the capture of Roger Casement.  And it's a
pastiche of the high modernisms of "Dubliners" and the beginning of
"Ulysses."  And it's this touching love story between two lower class
teenagers and the mysterious older man who takes an interest in them.
You read all this on the jacket copy and you think, what an awful
idea, but take my word for it, it's awesome!!  Just as good as "The
Tutor" even if more ambitious.

Folks, I am a slow & deliberate reader.  I can't do more than a few books at
a time. This is a great source of sadness for me, but it does force me to
pick my reading carefully.  I'm only actively reading the first two of
these:


* * *  Paul Fussell _the Great War and Modern Memory_.  Published in 1975,
this literary history of WWI won the Nat'l Book Award and the Nat'l Book
Critics Circle Award, but even so, it's damned good.  WWI truly did set the
tone for a century of high-tech war.

* * *  Patrick White _The Tree of Man_. (fiction) From australia--  This is
some of the toughest, most languagey prose I've read since I recently reread
Nathaniel Hawthorne (school assignment).  I recommend White to anyone who
reads English.  John Tranter recommends _Voss_.

Steve Malmude _The Bundle_ . (poems)  I already boosted this excellent
Sub-Press book once.

Maurice Manning _Lawrence Booth's Book of Visions_. (poems)  This book is
okay, kind of too self-consciously Southern for my taste.  I feel that it's
been done, and better.  Yet there are a few good 'uns in here.

Fielding Dawson _Tiger Lilies_.  I know several here recommended this--in
fact, Dawson hails from my home-suburb of Kirkwood, MO-- but I couldn't take
it.

Ben Marcus _Noteable American Women_.  Couldn't take it. Though I heard the
author read at Prarie Lights in April, and it seemed like good stuff. The
book is as thick as a ten-dollar spoon, infected by whatever it is that
makes David Eggers a great editor and much-hyped but terrible novelist.

Some things I'm reading lately:

_lingo_ by William Allegrezza: impressive debut chapbook from the editor of
_moria_

* _Learning to Count_ by Alberta Turner

* Pentti Saarikoski's work in _The Vintage Book of Contemporary World
Poetry_ (looking for more by this Finnish poet)

* _The Harlem Gallery_ by Melvin B. Tolson

Daniil Kharms . . . complete work is on the internet at
<http://www.geocities.com/Athens/8926/Kharms/>

Bengali poet Shamsur Rahman (in translation on the web), in honor of my
companion John Clark's recent visit to Bangladesh . . . some has a streak
of the absurd

_The Story of Writing_ by Andrew Robinson (gorgeously illustrated!) plus
anything I can find on the web about Rongorongo, the writing of Easter
Island

_The Origin of Language: Tracing the Evolution of the Mother Tongue_, by
Merritt Ruhlen . . . lets you engage in detective work comparing languages
of the world

I've been listening to a lot of that Nancarrow.  Also, for listeners up that
alley and the jazz alley, if anyone mentioned Henry Threadgill I missed it.
We're a household of devote listeners to his CD's, especially Song in My
Trees, and, most especially, the song entitled Grief.  It's halting.

"Is this like a role-call thing? To make ensure everybody ispolitical
alignmetns?"

It is a bit provocative, Kevin. Actually, I was thinking how this thread
enabled all the posters to congratulate themselves on their remarkable good
taste. Which is something I'd like to put an end to right away with my brief
list . . .

Books:
*Edward Dorn: A World of Difference* -- Tom Clark (North Atlantic)
--- I realize that about six people in the country have read this new
biography of Dorn by Tom Clark, but I thought one of them might be on this
list. If so, could you back-channel me? Would love to talk about it.

*The Botany of Desire* -- Michael Pollan (Random House)
--- Wonderful treatise about how plants use us to propagate themselves, with
chapters on the apple, the tulip, marijuana and potatoes. (OK, I did read
the third chapter first, but the whole book is fabulous, with the added
suggestion that an informed look at the science would mean a change in
traditional subject-object grammar).

*Kamasutra* -- new translation by Wendy Doniger & Sudhir Kakar (Oxford)
--- I realize that this is like saying one reads *Playboy* for the excellent
articles, but it was in fact fascinating to have this document placed in
historical context. And there are, in fact, some quite interesting
techniques for both men and women . . . as MasterCard would say, "timeless"

*Twilight of the Male Ego* -- klipschutz (Tsunami Inc.)
--- One of the things I often miss in contemporary poetry is humor, so when
I first smiled, then giggled, then laughed out loud several times while
reading this book -- not only because of its tour de force "Thirteen Ways of
Looking at a Burrito" but its wonderful titles (e.g., "I'm Wearing My Heart
on Your Sleeve")-- it became a keeper.

Also on the small endtable near the bed: *Power Politics* by Arundhati Roy;
*Gnosis and Hermeticism from Antiquity to Modern Times* ed. van den Broek
and Hanegraaff (thanks, Pat!); *Orpheus and His Lute* by Elisabeth Henry and
*The Orphic Poems* by M.L. West (part of an endless series); *A Test of
Poetry* by L.Z.; *The Birth of the Cool* by Lewis Macadams.

I've been listening to some late 70s albums by Bob Dylan, *Desire* (Joey
Gallo "Spent ten years in Attica / reading Nietzche and Wilhelm Reich") and
the very underrated *Street Legal* -- also, an album by Dexter Gordon called
*Manhattan Symphonie* that I'm surprised hasn't gotten more mention in the
apotheosis of things New York.

And I just saw *The Kid Stays in the Picture*, a fake documentary of the
career of Robert Evans as a producer at Paramount Studios, which is pretty
strange and wonderful -- the best film I've seen in a long time.

And finally (!) a question . . . Mike Magee, I was wondering what Duncan
essay you were referring to in your nice post about Larry Rivers . . .
"treating whatever happens in the course of art-making/thinking as
revelation, to paraphrase Duncan" (you can back-channel).

Well, I've read it & loved it -- a much better book than his Olson bio, --
and am looking forward to a needed second volume to fill out the years not
covered in this one & which I hope he is in the process of writing -- but I
think it would be an excellent _front-channel_ topic to discuss onm this
list -- p

Turning the pages of this first collection by Daniel Zimmerman there is
a magnification of external reality that mimics myth, yet these poems
only require living in the current world to be understood. A grandeur
mixes with heroism, as the things that are not said, existing just off
the viewable stage, project variously onto the reader’s mind. There is
an effect, call it old fashioned “yolking,” or a correlation between the
micro-cosm inside these poems and their global implications, but in
either case, when we finish reading and look around, a gorgeous new
order of natural complexity emerges.
—David Baratier

...this world has shrunk to something approximating the backyard with
the neighbor's tree blocking all the sun, the kids screaming, the
barbecue rusted out, the dog barking in manic hysteria, and oneself plus
beloved just sitting there, trying to keep even with that ‘outside’
which “leans in” on us, as Charles Olson said, forever. But “forever” is
also gone, lost back there in the wake.  Or it has become simply a
qualification of what one will never oneself know, just another one of
the “ten thousand and one things” which no longer seem to be around.  So
it's in that theoretic "here" these determinedly immaculate poems set to
work—to particularize, to locate, almost to feel by literal hand the set
and texture of the box into which we have driven our apparent lives.

Raves Endangered?
Feds Go After All-Night Music Parties

By Geraldine Sealey



Aug. 16 - Generational showdowns abound in music history. In the =
Prohibition era, flappers and free-flowing jazz and booze irked =
authorities. Decades later, buttoned-down elders condemned Woodstock as =
just a hippie drug fest.=20

      Now, politicians are targeting raves, the all-night electronic =
music and dance marathons held anywhere from nightclubs to open fields - =
also known these days as "massives," or "desert parties." Young devotees =
of rave culture claim that no musical genre in recent memory has been so =
endangered by a misunderstanding political and ruling class.=20
      If a proposal working its way through the U.S. Congress becomes =
law, raves could become extinct, they say, or at least driven far =
underground. Proponents of the bill say they're not specifically =
targeting rave parties or dance music but so-called "club drugs" such as =
Ecstasy, Rohypnol and GHB, which they say permeate rave culture.=20

      The RAVE Act, which stands for "Reducing Americans' Vulnerability =
to Ecstasy," expands the federal "crack-house" statute, designed to =
prosecute anyone whose buildings are used as drug havens, to include =
party promoters. Under the Senate bill, anyone involved with the =
planning of a rave who knows drugs are used, exchanged or made there =
could face criminal charges and be subject to a civil penalty of =
$250,000 or two times the gross receipts derived from each violation.=20

      The legislation's broad language may appear to encompass any =
nightclub or other venue where drugs may be present, but the act's title =
suggests that the real targets here are raves.=20

      "This gives prosecutors a common-sense tool to go after the worst =
kind of promoters, those who seek to profit from drug use by young =
people," said Chip Unruh, a spokesman for Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who =
sponsored the legislation. "A lot of these folks advertise the parties =
as alcohol-free for parents then through a wink and a nod or through =
covert flyers let [young people] know drug use will be permitted there." =


      A similar bill in the U.S. House of Representatives seeks to hold =
"promoters of drug-oriented entertainment" liable for hosting events at =
which drug use is widespread.=20

      Do Glow Sticks and Pacifiers Promote 'E'?=20

      Federal drug enforcement authorities have been focusing their =
efforts more in recent years on the increasingly popular Ecstasy - the =
street name for MDMA, or 3, 4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, reputed to =
bring euphoric highs to users.=20

      According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network, thousands of =
teenagers are treated for overdoses and Ecstasy-related health problems =
in emergency rooms each year. Ecstasy mentions in emergency visits grew =
1,040 percent between 1994 and 1999, the group said.=20

      RAVE Act supporters say that tens of thousands of young people are =
initiated into the drug culture every year at raves. Some posters for =
raves prominently feature pictures of Ecstasy pills or the letter "E," =
they say, which is slang for Ecstasy. Some rave promoters sell items =
believed to enhance the effects of drugs, such as neon glow sticks, =
massage oils, menthol nasal inhalers, and pacifiers, which combat the =
involuntary teeth-clenching associated with Ecstasy, the legislation =
reads.=20

      The RAVE Act language also accuses some rave promoters of =
exploiting young drug users by charging exorbitant prices for bottled =
water and entrance fees to "chill-out" rooms when they know Ecstasy =
raises body temperatures and causes thirst.=20

      "It's certainly clear from anecdotal evidence that the use of =
Ecstasy really took off and was embraced by a number of people in the =
rave scene," said Howard Simon, spokesman for the Partnership for a =
Drug-Free America, which supports the RAVE Act. "The reason why =
something usually becomes a stereotype is because something is so true =
at first."=20

      The push for new legislation comes as law enforcement authorities =
have had mixed results going after promoters with laws already on the =
books. Last year, federal prosecutors arrested the owners of two dance =
clubs, Club La Vela in Tallahassee, Fla., and the State Palace Theater =
in New Orleans, under the crack-house law.=20

      A jury cleared the Tallahassee club owners, and the New Orleans =
owners copped a plea but later won on appeal.=20

      Ravers: You Say Drug Toys, We Say Pure Fun=20

      Allegations about the pervasiveness of drugs at raves are based on =
anecdotal evidence only, ravers counter, since statistics cannot really =
prove that Ecstasy is more prevalent at raves than anywhere else young =
people congregate.=20

      While some ravers may take drugs, illegal substances are no more =
central to rave culture than any other music scene or even any college =
campus, they say. Those who identify with rave culture say the federal =
government and many drug prevention organizations have the rave ethos - =
and even some rave practices - all wrong.=20

      "[The RAVE Act] is using a prejudice against youth to then broaden =
the war on drugs without any sound information about what is happening =
at these events," said Tim Santamour, executive director of Dance Safe, =
a "harm reduction" group that promotes safe party practices.=20

      Rave-goers say there are less sinister explanations for some of =
the party traditions cited in the federal legislation. Some items =
described as drug paraphernalia, such as the pacifiers, are just plain =
entertainment, they say.=20

      "Chill-out" rooms are commonly used to provide a haven from the =
loud music and the heat of the dance floor, they say. And expensive =
bottled water can be found at most sports stadiums and mainstream =
concerts, they add, not just at raves.=20

      "These people are describing every cultural item in this scene as =
being nefarious including water," said Gary Blitz, director of the =
Electronic Music Defense Foundation in Orange County, Calif. "That would =
be really evil if there were a group of people knowing kids need water =
and drawing them in and then ripping them off for the water. The facts =
simply aren't there to support it."=20

      Raves Could Go Back Underground=20

      If critics really understood the culture they were attacking, they =
would recognize a way of life that promotes healthy values, ravers say. =
Over the years, for example, the rave culture has adopted the slogan =
"PLUR," which stands for peace, love, unity and respect.=20

      "Society's been dealing with hate crimes, drive-bys and gangs and =
prejudice, and the government spent zillions of dollars in programs to =
fix this and fix that. Here's a group of people, a youth movement, whose =
ideals are you accept everyone," Blitz said.=20

      Simon, of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, says if the =
rave spirit does not depend on drugs, then ravers should not oppose the =
legislation intended to rid their parties of Ecstasy and other =
substances.=20

      "Anybody who believes in what the rave community originally stood =
for should not have a problem with that," he said.=20

      But ravers, disc jockeys and electronic music fans worry that =
legitimate club owners and venue managers will be unwilling to risk =
hosting a rave, or any dance party resembling a rave, if the legislation =
is passed.=20

      Some predict that the RAVE Act would just drive the rave scene =
underground, essentially where it came from 20 years ago, to remote =
fields, abandoned factories and other fringe locations where conditions =
could get more dangerous for ravers.=20

      As it is, many rave organizers now pay off-duty police officers to =
patrol the venue, or employ security guards who are trained in emergency =
medical services. Mainstream venues such as nightclubs must comply with =
fire codes. But these safeguards would not exist at "underground" =
locations.=20

      RAVE Act supporters say that's no reason to allow drug-condoning =
parties to continue. "We think it is more dangerous to go somewhere =
where drug use is welcomed rather than discouraged," Simon said.=20

      Musical Genocide?=20

      Beyond the danger to ravers' health, some electronic music fans =
also say the legislation's loose language threatens the music itself, =
which is glued together by the clubs and other venues that host raves. =
Aside from a handful of commercially-successful electronic musicians, =
such as Moby, whose songs serve as jingles for a variety of television =
advertisements, the electronic music genre has produced few mainstream =
stars. Mainstream radio stations and major record labels largely have =
not warmed to the style.=20

      If concert promoters and club owners shy away from raves, then, =
electronic music will essentially lose its main stage - or at least will =
have to build a new one, ravers say.=20

      "It's musical genocide," said Amanda Huie, director of marketing =
for Buzzlife Productions in Washington, D.C. "It's so obviously =
targeting a specific kind of music. That's clearly unconstitutional."=20

      Huie, who collected 10,000 signatures for a petition opposing the =
bill in less than a week, said she and her colleagues, which include the =
American Civil Liberties Union and an auditorium managers' association, =
do not want to defeat the bill but reform it.=20

      "We want to make it specific so it targets criminals," she said, =
"No matter how hard you search, to keep drugs out of venues is almost =
impossible. The federal government can't even keep drugs out of =
prisons," she said.=20

      But Unruh, Biden's spokesman, says legislators have no intention =
of endangering electronic music - only the drugs so often associated =
with it.=20

      "We set the bar very high," he said. "Legitimate promoters of any =
type of music have nothing to fear from our bill."=20

      Legislation on raves is due to be considered by Congress this =
fall.=20

I thank you for the post, I would not have known otherwise.

For others unfamiliar with Jim Kopta, he was a fine metalurgist,
musician and thinker who had profound influence on many,  across borders
of genre, tho best known as a noise musician with radical practices.
Perhaps the only bands that came close to the work he did under the
moniker Brown Cuts Neighbors (& plenty of others)  was Friends Forever,
who toured the US in a van, the inside of which was their stage, with a
lighting manager & when they were excited staged dived back into the van
thru the front side window. One of the best practicioners of the Alfred
Jarry school of Ubism or patapsychology, their first widely distributed
single "Broken Down like a Bean" on Wow-cool records brought them in
contact with Jad Fair, who was accused of copying BCN by many ever
since. Half-Japanese, Fair's band, met up with Penn Juliet (of Penn &
Teller fame) who worked as a super-promoter for their efforts, using
funding from a guest appearance on Miami Vice to create
1,000,000,000,000,000 (etc.) Watts Records (I think their real name was
100 Gigawatts records, do you know Gerry? Chris Stroff?? somebody?) who
became best known for releasing Moe Tucker's (from the Velvet Und.)
first solo record. Anyway reading this over now it all seems like a
bizarre train of circumstance fitting of patapsychology, that Jim was
found face down, relegated to the realm of "local artist," floating in
the water of a town he loathed.

Hi Aaron,

Thanks for the kind words -- I feel weird posting about things that are
probably unknown to many on the list, so when I feel that, I tend to go
overboard trying to contextualize stuff.

I had this whole conversation last night with Murat and Nada where one of
them asked me why I liked this music so much--and I said that for one thing
it's very hybridized stuff. Murat & I talked a lot about that (& in relation
to how we're thinking about writing these days), how there's this
undercurrent of tradition--the instrumentation, the rhythms, the
modalities--which are already intensely various--which then get sometimes
beautifully or grotesquely or otherwise astonishingly warped by, into,
through a number of other influences/styles/modes. And often, especially in
Egyptian music--Angham's "Salam Allay" (from her CD "Beth Mein," I think)
being the most amazing example I've heard recently--the "integration" is
anything but seamless--it's the musical equivalent of very radical
cut'n'paste or assemblage or Google-search writing or something. Except with
this very traditional undercurrent that the "sampled" elements get warped
into. And it's very different from most actual sampling--which usually
feels/sounds seamless to me. Except in Euro or American-produced CDs, like
some of Khaled's, there isn't really any actual sampling--it's more a
stylistic borrowing, but where all of the disparate pieces are wedged in
here, there, up here, behind here--intricately and endlessly hippogriffed.
So, I have this love of/fascination with multiplicity, in general &
including in writing, when it happens, but that I think has been most
successfully made manifest in much middle eastern music, and some popular
southeast Asian music and some east Euro music, too. Which is why I'm
posting endlessly about it, I guess--it's been very influencial /
inspirational stuff for me. (If I had time & could think clearly today I'd
write something about "assimilation" and how this music distorts, undercuts,
& otherwise plays with ideas of "assimilation," & the political & social
ramifactions of that, which I think would be interesting to think about.)

Anyway. I've been poking around online and found places to get some of the
music mentioned--most notably, the Music of Lebanon site, which sells CDs
for $10.95 and tapes for $3.49! And they have *lots* of Najwa!

http://www.musicoflebanon.com/nkaram.htm

... will take you right there; just scroll down to where it says "Buy Najwa
Karam CDs and Cassettes and click on that.

Some great ones to start with are: "Ya Habayeb" (listed as "Ya 7abaayeb")
"Naghmet Hob" ("Naghmet 7ob") and *especially* "Hazzy Hilo" (listed as
"7azzi 7elow"). That tape will make your hair stand on end! Though not for
hippogriff reasons so much as, like, The Pixies kind of reasons: it's
gritty, catchy, nearly out of control. (The Egyptian stuff is the really
hippogriffy stuff.)

The musicoflebanon site has lots of sample tracks, too. (Most of these below
do, too, actually.)

A couple other great middle-eastern/arabic music sites where you can get CDs
(and maybe cassettes) are:

http://www.aramusic.com/

http://www.rashid.com

The Rashid one above is for the store in Brooklyn (on Court Street a block
or two south of Atlantic Avenue), and they have a great online catalog. I
know they have some Asalah and Kazem CDs for 4.95 on sale right now--or did
a month ago, anyway--plus pretty much all of their Algerian music, except
for really popular stuff like Khaled and Cheb Mami. They have an 800 number
listed there as well.

http://www.nagham.com/

Nagham (above) has specials on CDs for $5 and tapes for $1.99! They're in
Plano, Texas--no street address, just a P.O. Box.

And here's a whole list of links to other places to get the music online:

Okay, I have to go back to work. Have fun!

So glad you thought so, Pierre. There were a number of real hits for me: the
amazingly hardscrabble years of poverty with Helene, the early enthusiasms
for Reich and Olson (there's a paper to be written there, scholars!), the
mature poetics in embryo as early as 1952. I'm not so sure about the
necessity for a second volume, actually -- it's true that it only goes up
through the beginning of *Gunslinger* (about 1968), but there are a few
short telescopic references to the later work, and it would be hard, I
think, to duplicate the melange of biography/poetics as effectively as he
does here.

I was a *little* bothered by the lack of footnotes and other scholarly
apparatus, but that would have made it a very different book.

A couple of quotes, then: from a 1952 letter presaging the prose piece "C, B
& Q":

"These people on 12th Street, the skid row of K.C., have mixed,
conglomerate, fantastically inconsistent manners, ways. Most of them, on the
one hand, have murdered or done bodily harm for the price of a draught beer,
yet these same ones, in a tavern, which almost always reeks with their
faintly puky smell, will spend their last dime for a beer for you and be
insulted if you decline they are so kind with you, so concerned, they are so
gentle, yet a Negro can't go into the same bar with them, these lowest of
lows, . . . I have found in the men I have come onto and talked with the
most incredible kind of unobjectiveness. They have absolutely *no* sense of
objective. And fact is completely unknown. I have largely kept my mouth shut
and listened. The impulse to point out prejudice and superstition is great
but I have succeeded in listening, at last, silently. Because one of the
first things I learned was the uselessness, the hopelessness of argument
with these people. Which brings me to a point. [What I have] said about
availability and reality (an earlier reference to Olson's "Human Universe"),
excuse me for. It is so easy to intellectualize about that. And there is
great danger in intelligence only. It is too easy to say, to talk, as I have
heard only meaningless empty talk these past few days, about the things we
should be living, but are so crippled, by now, that mere talk itself has
become the objective." (143)

In 1961, Denise Levertov was poetry editor of *The Nation* and took an early
poem of Dorn's called "Hemlocks" -- a reader wrote in and asked about "the
theory of poetry under which this becomes a poem" -- Dorn wrote back to say,
in part:

"In the early part of the century the preoccupation continuously shifted
from problems of feet and strictly scansionable lines to problems of what
was then called image and is now not called anything with consistency. The
freedom would seem to lie now in a search for Right content, form rather
following that." . . . (and later in a 1963 radio interview) "I don't think
about measure and line, in a technical sense, that much. Clots of phrase,
really. And not Olson's 'breath' because . . . [it's] a false problem . . .
I think it will become less important as the content of our speech becomes
more important -- as what we're saying becomes more important to all of us."
{Clark then writes]: "In this formulation, it appears that content is not,
as in the legendary Creeley dictum, simply 'extended' by form; content
rather *is form*, or at least dictates all formal considerations."

(Sorry for this very long post).

>> yes, and why up to this point has it all been limited to books&music? i'm
close reading every John Milius and John Cassavetes movie I can find this
summer. little poetry incorporates pieces of time as well as these films. <<

I just saw the brilliant new documentary on Cassavetes, "A Constant Forge" -
which has me wanting to watch all his films again...

I Reply:

I'm still waiting for the voices to tell me what I think.
I'll have to get back to you.

Ahem, "But seriously folks . . ."  very few specific cross-overs on
these lists so far as I can tell. And why not stand behind what you've
been reading?

It makes sense to me, though, that people on this list, the way this list
is, would be reading similar things, things not, um, widely known. Is
"known" the right word? Should it be "things not widely discussed"?
Maybe I should just say "obscure"? Or maybe "endorsed by the
cultural machinery"?

Then I must admit that I haven't heard of most of the books people
have listed here. So I guess I have to look them up. Drat, homework.
And here I thought I was well read! Well, gotta get going . . .

Best,

I'm sorry, but can someone repost the original
obituary, or backchannel it to me?  I think I missed
it, and only after reading David Baratier's posting do
I realize that I think I might have known Jim--I think
I went to high school with him, or at least with his
friends.

The band he was in, the Brown Cuts Neighbors, were
formed one day in gym class when a bunch of us were
sitting around trying to avoid running the track at
Niskayuna High School in Schenectady, NY (this was the
late 80s).  Jason Martin and some other guys (Rob
Goodale, I think?) were talking about starting a band,
even though they didn't really play any instruments.
We thought it was a joke.  Then they came out with a
little tape--"Broken Down Like a Bean"--and gave out
copies with handmade covers around school...I think I
still have mine.  The songs were totally insane and
wonderful: one of my favorites was called "Running
Naked on Peyote" and it still gets stuck in my head to
this day.

I moved away from the Capital District of upstate NY
after high school, and so it was always amazing to me
to go back to Albany and see BCN written up as a
serious avant-noise collective in the local papers.
To me they were always just a bunch of the craziest
guys in my high school.  I went to a show they did
once on Niska-Day, the annual town pride festival, in
which they played alongside other, far more
conventional bands.  BCN were nuts, of course, playing
conceptual hardcore until some school administrator
pulled the plug.  It was a great event.

I'm sorry to hear about Jim.

Arielle

Listening:

Anything I can find Gidon Kremer's recorded, esp. From My Home (a better
performance of Fratres than on Tabula Rasa), and the Beethoven sonatas
with Martha Argerich;
Lukas Foss's piano concertos;
(guilty schizy pleasure cheese) David Sylvian's Camphor;
the Nigeria 70 compilation;
anything I can find by U Roy, esp. "Great Great Great" on the Trojan Rare
Groove box;
(guilty pop depression cheese) The Strokes;
any Ramones on any jukebox, ditto NY Dolls, ditto the Who.

Reading:

Susan Schultz's Aleatory Allegories, and Memory Cards/Adoption Papers
(old and new testaments of syntax - the subsidiary clauses given up, it
all falls together);
Susan Wheeler's Smokes and Source Codes;
Karen Volkman's Spar and Jennifer Moxley's Sense Record (two eerily similar
second books);
Paul Muldoon's Moy Sand and Gravel, Hay, and The Annals of Chile;
Karen Horney's Self-Analysis and Our Inner Conflicts (viva August break!);
galleys for the late Kenneth Koch's Sun Out poems 52-54 and A Possible
World (due in October);
Ron Padgett's You Never Know;
Drew Gardner's Sugar Pill (rocks!);
Kaia Sand's and Tom Orange's summer subpoetics self-publish-or-perish books;
Bivouac 2;
the friggin WSJ and FT, gotta break that compulsion, ditto Bloomberg;
Steve Burt's essay on Rae Armantrout in the Boston Review (forgive him for
coining "elliptical poets", this one's worth a look);
galleys for my forthcoming Million Poems Journal.

I've read it.  Not bad.  But interesting in terms of what it chose not to
cover.  A consequence I'd guess of the discretion being exercised by Clark.
I await a more comprehensive effort.

When I read it quite a number of years ago, I was really blown away by
Slinger.  But the other bits and pieces I've randomly come across haven't
seemed to me to be anywhere near the same level.  As i say, tho, this
exposure has been limited and haphazard.  Any recommendations?

This is the third YARD.  No open mic, no mic.  No featured readers.  Yes
bring something to read.  This means you.  Keep in mind the sun sets earlier
and it is much colder than it should be.  B.Y.O.B.  August 31st, 7:00 pm.
Be there or be somewhere else.  But keep in mind... we may have turtle pools
and another impromptu dj set by doug steedman...

Miekal -

It is an initiative suggested by Juliana Spahr four or five or six summers
ago that a group of twenty or thirty poets who were pestering each other
on big backchannel cc lists all do something about this persistent
invisibility we were complaining about: that we each self-publish a
chapbook and mail a copy to all the others. Sort of the mid-year
equivalent of a New Year's Day reading -- everybody hears what everybody
else is doing. When you have to print something and transact with the
USPS, "everybody" is going to be limited to the people on the address
lists, but as they say in the corporate world, resource questions tend to
answer themselves. DIY means save a little money and time for beer.

As an aside, I'm pretty sure it was the good vibe of the self-po that led
Anselm Berrigan to propose the somewhat more ambitious Subpress project,
in which seventeen or eighteen writers donate one percent of their income
to a small press they run collectively. Subpress' books include Edwin
Torres's Fractured Humorous, Catalina Cariaga's Cultural Evidence, Jen
Hofer's slide rule, Dan Bouchard's Diminutive Revolutions, Steve Malmude's
The Bundle, Prageeta Sharma's Bliss to Fill, John Wilkinson's Oort's
Cloud, and I believe forthcoming titles from Hoa Nguyen, Brett Evans, Ben
Friedlander, and Dug Rothschild. Who'd I forget. Scott Bentley, John
McNally, Camille Guthrie, and Caroline Sinavaiana-Gabbard.

These are both just potlatches and cooperatives, not to minimize the
effort and headache of either. But given how committed most readers and
writers of poetry are, not to speak of rebellious and independent, it
surprises me every month to overhear others (and myself!) resentful that
they haven't been given an opportunity to participate in x reading series,
y magazine, or z book-publisher. Why not just get a saddle-stapler (or a
copy of Adobe Acrobat), make something, and give it to people you want to
read you?

(Miekal, I know you are the soul of DIY. I just splaining this particular
instance.)

Dear Buffalo Soldiers,

I'm listening to a lot of Bob Marley and reading (trying to read) Timothy =
White's biography
Catch a Fire, which I find a little strange.  I just got Tony Bird's =
"Sorry Africa" which I first heard songs from 14 years ago on Cape Cod and =
have remembered ever since.

I'm reading Maya Lin's Boundaries and a transcript of her Cooper Union =
lecture for her "Between Art and Architecture" exhibition in 2000.  Plus a =
lot of self-help books.

<!--StartFragment-->
*  Saturday September 21 Lorine Niedecker, a celebration of her work    with
Jenny Penberthy &amp; special guests:  Glenna Breslin, Norma Cole,
Beverly
Dahlen, Kathleen Fraser, Thom Gunn &amp; August Kleinzahler at    Unitarian
Center, 7:30 pm

It's too bad that Cid Corman wasn't asked to take part in this.  He was only
Lorine's good friend and one of the few people still around who actually met
her in the flesh.    How about including a tape recording of Cid reading his
poems for her, or reading from the letters?  Or maybe a video?  Or how about
an internet hook-up?  Cid is on-line.

Cid was also asked by Lorine to be her literary executor and--you know-- he
doesn't make a penny from it, though he could sorely use the money.  He's
really helped L.N. scholarship by his continuing generosity in this regard.
I've noticed a few people on the list mentioning The Granite Pail's
selection as being quite good.  That collection was edited by Cid Corman.
Not to mention the fact that Cid and the (late, Cid says) Gail Raub rescued
lots of L.N's work--including persoanl papers, early on.

"To be absent is to be dead" goes a Zen saying.  How true. How true.  Jesse

To all -

Yes, an unpleasant note was sent from my email address to Mr. Herron. I have
privately apologized to him, and offer the same to you.

My young house guest seems to have randomly read my email, and singled out
Mr. Herron's posting for response.

Thank you.

Just recently I had to assure someone that Cid Corman really is in bad
financial straits.  Without going into details I can assure you all of that
fact.

Shizumi, Cid's wife, jokes that when she met and married Cid she thought she
was marrying a "rich American."  She's a great lady, with a great sense of
humor.  Cid--now in his late 70s-- depends on her for almost everything.

Shizumi has an eye condition that requires surgery and of course they cannot
afford to pay for it.

Cid made a choice years and years ago to live outside academia and to
practice his art in perfect freedom, which is all well and good when you
have more years ahead of you than behind.

I believe that certain channels had been set up earlier via people on this
list to help Cid and Shizumi.  If those folks could please try to help
again, it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, Jesse

Re: - the last part - please forgive me for intruding -

I think in a way this is too limited, because it doesn't take distribution
models into account. It keeps things going, as at least one of the lists
did that was descended from Poetics, in the same circles, the same
resonances. To have a book on a shelf in an unknown bookstore in an
unknown town, to have new readers, to have the potential of new exchanges,
brings writing closer to the culture, expands horizons, creates an edge.
Miekal has been able to do that through extended publications, articles on
his work or by him in other magazines, list participations, and a terrific
decades history of publication - I first saw his work in Atlanta nineteen
years ago. (One of my best memories is hearing my record on the radio when
I was driving across the US in the late 80s for example.)

Writing, poetry in particular, cuts itself off precisely by self-publica-
tion, unless one has the financial means for distribution.

And like an exclusive poetry list, this creates a kind of elitism - I'll
associate with _X_, but not with _Y_ for whatever reason -

having made much the same choice as Cid Corman, I can assure you that it's
not easy. I'm sure many on this list have made similar choices. Potes &
Poets Press would like to help Cid with a donation of books.  please
backchannel either myself ( bramhall52@earthlink.net ) or Beth (
emgarrison@earthlink.net ). Cid's book Root Song was the first perfectbound
book this press published.

although I will say that putting a lot of stuff online -- hundreds of
pages -- like so many of us do seems to be a little less coterie-like --

send me links!

do consider not just making stuff available as pdf -- what's so bad about
html?

definitely seems to be bringing together the english-speaking middle class

I don't mean to sound contentious---I mean this in genuine curiosity,
but how does this tally with your "saturate the email listserve" philosophy?
Isn't that self publication?

hello my name is pornalisa

two weeks ago august highland under the tutelage of alan sondheim posed the
question is there a place in literature for pornography

many responses to this question made it clear that yes there was a place

by coincidence i was working on a literary project with pornography as a
principle element in this project

now the project is complete

it is my innermost desire that you visit my project and that you enjoy it as

I think that not everyone enjoys reading poetry while seated at a computer.
I need some repose to read properly, and I find that none comes, at my desk

somehow to add to it easily and have people se what I'm writing _now_.  I
did the site myself, and of course know how to update it, but it is a pain.
On the other hand I should at least be doing that since I am not getting
published...

I must admit that one reason I don't get published is I am not
submitting...or barely.  It's just discouraging.  I would be happy to be in
some of the nice web zines that are now appear8ing or in the smaller
journals but when I have limited energy (I am ill) I'd rather write than
submit.  Sometimes I get some help with this from my (gasp! mother -- who is
also a writer) and then occasinally, not even rarely enough that I have a
rignt to complain, I get something in.  But it is an exhasiting process.

I have the skills to self publish well (desktop publishing etc.) and would
be interested in doing so if there was some way to get other people to see
the result -- other meaning other than my circle of poetry people and so on.
Alan is right, self-publishing is nice but it would be nicer to be in a
bookstore...

Some poems really must be in PDF to have full appeal.  I did a parody of
Language Poetry (a loving prody) which had very particular page layout, and
it is very hard to do that in pure html.  And I've done a few
vsiual/concrete ooems.

But in general you are right.  People lock up their poems in PDFs when they
are just plain text and could be beautifully laid out html, searchable on
the net and you wouldn't end up in the acrobat reader and get confused,
after having to download.  I think some people want to make sire you get
their entire new collection instead of just the one poem you are looking at,
and that is misguided.  It irritates me, and I won't read someone's entire
collection unles I like the first poem anyway...

although I will say that putting a lot of stuff online -- hundreds of

send me links!

do consider not just making stuff available as pdf -- what's so bad about

Dear List Folk:

I am compiling a list of 20th century African-American poets whose work is
in some way marked by formal innovation. Formal "innovation" may be defined
variously. In the 18th century, for example, Phillis Wheatley may have
"innovated" while working within the traditions of English neoclassicism.

Here are some names to start. Please add your suggestions.

Jean Toomer
Elouise Loftin
Julia Fields
Amiri Baraka
Nathaniel Mackey
Will Alexander
Erica Hunt
Harryette Mullen
Renee Gladman
Giovanni Singleton
Mark McMorris

Thank you,

Subject:      "Crossover" Reading
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Folks:
If to "crossover" means to read work outside the mainstream of this list, I
recommend the practice. It's like truly listening to a conservative point of
view while you're biting your liberal tongue off.

I am a "crossover" reader. I read widely. As a high school teacher in a
small Idaho college town, I have to. The writing that interests and
challenges me -- that I hope will eventually interest and challenge my
students as readers and writers -- does not filter into Moscow, Idaho (or
Peoria) on its own (or, alas, on the skinny wings of small press poetry
distributors). And I don't just read for myself. I've crossed over and read
many poets excoriated on this list: Collins, Oliver, Stafford, Bly, Kinnell,
and perhaps too many others. I confess, despite the strength of my biases, I
have liked some of the poems I have encountered as a teacher-reader. I have
even re-read some of them when I put my teacher hat away.

As a teacher, I'm always looking for the "gateway drug" for young readers of
poetry. I have read all of Billy Collins work this summer, finding a dozen
poems that may turn on one of my 17 year-old readers much as Robert Frost
turned me on at 15. (Then I met Howl, yow!)

Ginsberg, Whalen, Snyder, Waldman, Koch, O'Hara, Levertov, Niedecker, Plath,
Kerouac and Silliman (his Tjanting blows my readers away, both content and
fibonacci form) have been "gateway drugs" for some young readers who -- put
yourself back in those hard, narrow desks -- need immediate returns. Once
they have had that first buzz, I find them to be greater risk-takers (not
necessarily future heroin addicts), willing to work at reading poetry, able
to tangle with concrete/visual poetry, to listen to Coolidge, Basinski,
Bennett, Perelman, or poets that I might have read the night before (they
rarely read these poets on their own, "unsupervised," nor would they ever
consider riding in a car without a designated driver after hearing Eigner or
Creeley or even Lee Ann Brown).

In fact, to continue the confessional (without invoking Robert Lowell or
Sylvia Plath), this crossingover has me conflicted. I want to create
life-long readers of poetry -- through my teaching, my writing, my
publishing activities -- but I am often underwhelmed by the poetry that gets
my students high (the same doesn't happen with prose -- I still get drunk on
Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Morrison, Twain, Alice Walker, O'Brien, Vonnegut,
Salinger, Julia Alvarez), so sometimes poetry gets short-shrifted. It was a
hell of a lot easier when, teaching at Berkeley High School in the early
1990s, I could bring a range of poets into class -- from Spencer Selby to
students from June Jordan's classes. That contact high might do more for
creating new readers of poetry than books or websites (thus I choke on my
bias against poetry slams and such).

Best, Crag Hill

Sunday

In the morning I went with Bob Grumman up to John M. Bennett's house,
where we were shown thru his press operation with Ficus Strangulensis
and Jim Leftwich. A small box like structure in the shape of a U, each
of us were photographed in "the chair" an object heavily resembling a
chair but only used for visual & poetic practice.

We all went out for coffee and during this I was able to ask Ficus about
many of the questions that I didn't ask at his panel (primarily because
I had already asked double the number of anyone else).  I had a long
talk with Jim Leftwich & was able to score a copy of Doubt, Pote &
Poets, one of the few epic poems of the last fifty years. & catch up on
his motions between editing Juxta & extant.

----------
then @ 349 E Morrill Ave in the heart of Columbus' south end
-----------

Unsuspectingly, while I was out buying fresh corn from the farmers a few
blocks away, poets were appearing at my house. Although I had stated
noon as a start time, there was no real expectation of things beginning
then but the hotel had asked everyone to checkout by noon. The
downstairs was full so I immediately soaked the corn.

While the plan was that Head Chef & Associate Editor, Stephen Mainard,
would lead the rest of the Pavement Saw interns into the uncharted area
of outdoor barbeque, only Sean Kearns and Toledo James appeared, both of
whom are inept grill boys. Veggie burgers and Not Dogs (made with the
most heineous leftover parts of vegetable varieties) were served along
with corn on the cob roasted in the shuck (& later meat) and a bevy of
side dishes.

As with any shindig at our house, we ate well & our friends Jackie &
Toledo brought an amazing basket of brownies made with plenty of super
special ingredients including Ghiardelli chocolate which Camile was
thoroughly impressed by, raving it was the best thing she's eaten in the
states so far.

I began the reading with a non-avant guarde poem, Howdy, a signature
piece welcoming all to our space & area of the city. As the crowd
further settled down, my lovely wife Rita read a gorgeous poem about our
backyard. Muscle cars whined in the far background and dogs were barking
as mIEKAL aND took the stage, a de-weeded area of lawn slightly to the
left of the walk. At this moment I looked up and counted 35 people, &
there were still a few straglers inside. I was really impressed with
Igor Satanovsky's readings thru the weekend & this was no different.
Around this time my memory goes thin,  John M. Bennett read a few, Jesse
Glass read a poem to imitate the style of Bennett,  John Byrum & Arleen
Hartman were there but did not read, the lovely Renee was whisking
around taking pictures before after & during Lewis LaCook's reading, and
I briefly saw Ed Lense before he disappeared from view. Other highlights
I remember include Geoffrey Gatza doing a Legion of Doom poem (you
impressed the staff),  Jim Leftwich refusing to read anything, Brandon
Barr making special arrangements to say goodbye, Joel Lipman did a 70's
poem,  and near the end Thom Taylor was gyp'd as he read a superb
section of Kilobyte Magnificat to a thinning crowd.

Somewhere toward the end, our movie star friend Ratboy arrived & really
hit it off with Jesse Glass, and they had a discussion about the
Japanese mafia due to his uncoverable tattoos, we found out Jesse's wife
was expecting & due within a week after his return, congrats on Junko
Tennesee. In the closing ceremony, John M. Bennett gave a scintillating
speech about visual arts and asparagus which received many encores.
Richard Kostelanetz still needs $1.50 (US) to take a subway.

While there is much more, that is all I have to contribute.

There is a second festival forming, the location, while unstable,
appears to be near Baltimore, Maryland.

Be well

In the last 6 months or so Ive been trying to dislodge myself from creating &
publishing only in electronic forms.  Having been involved in small press
pubishing since the late 70s my feeling has been that it has grown flat &
predictable, that the energy needed to bring out a couple 100 copies of a title
& the effort required to physically distribute the titles could not be
justified year after year in the face of how easily it has become to create an
international audience & community online.  But the last months the Ive
seriously been missing print publication, gearing up to bring out long awaited
titles from Xexoxial (our book of Bern Porter interviews was accepted in 1990 &
still waiting to come out.)  & more than anything my creamy desires to be
printing hard copy again have been fueled by a couple bookfairs Ive been to
lately.  To my taste that is the part of the puzzle that has really fallen
away,  a realtime marketplace where you cannot help but meet & move titles
outside of the inner circle.  Where are the book fairs? Years ago every region
literally had at least one yearly fair that was set up by consortiums of
presses.  Cross-pollination abounds in this events & typically this is a good
measure of if yr titles have a life outside their small circles.  Because
Xexoxial has done a lot with unique bindings, boxes, hand techniques & has
pledged since the beginning to keep its titles affordable, Ive been to
bookfairs where we were the only experimental prss in attendance & exposed a
lot of unsuspecting browsers to a world they had no idea existed.

One of the most encouraging developments to my mind has been a couple
bookmobile projects.  The Automadic Bookmobile which is co-sponsored by
Autonomedia Press & the Bindlestiff Cirkus, has been going around putting on
little circus side shows around the country & opening their bookmobile for
circus goers to be exposed.  When they came thru last week & asked to take a
pile of Xexoxial books onboard for the remainder of their tour, I took it as a
sure sign that someone is staying up late strategizing new forms of face to
face distribution. (They are on the road til november, maybe coming to a town
near you.)  The folks on the bus also turned my onto another bookmobile
(actually an airstream trailer) project funded by Canada Council that is
centered around book arts.  All this is to say that while the book is here to
stay, the distribution & printing models are in need of serious renovation.

I very much appreciated these thoughts from Jordan and his and Alan's
underlining of Miekel's efforts to further distribute important work in
contemporary poetry. For me, the issue of self- or cooperative publishing
brings to mind another, related, issue, that is, the status of the poem as
an object of discovery, as compared to say, a (collectible) object of
invention. I feel that if experimental poets utilized a model for our field
similar to (an Idealistic, and applicable version of) one of the models used
in the sciences, that is the confirmable repeatability of experimental
outcomes, as opposed to the unrepeatable singularity of individual
inventions, than the obvious next step would be to move towards a much more
rapid distribution of confirmable discoveries. The vexing issue is, are
poems composed mainly of information (signals) or are they objects that
contain mysterious substances that cannot be isolated?  Perhaps one of the
reasons that many writers don't mind the label "experimental" is that on
some, perhaps somewhat unconscious, level they are interested in moving
closer to the ideals and methods of science. What if, for example, instead
of thinking of poems  mainly as collectible objects, they were thought of as
experiments in perception? These experiments in perception could then be
understood as methods of ascertaining and isolating the way perception
operates and, as a result, might bear valuable information about how
perception could be expanded or better focused. Instead of promoting
standards for better poetry using the old and new masters as examples,
experimental poets might encourage standards for evaluating the value of
discoveries and the ways that such discoveries could be disseminated and
employed in future poetry. I think of such Dada ideas as cutting up a
newspaper, shaking around the words and then letting them fall to the table,
as the ground for some important contemporary and less recent work in the
field of poetry and the plastic arts, for example. Then the frequent
practice on the part of poets of more or less repeating some of the methods
of some of the more adventuresome poets of the present and the past would be
placed in the context of being crucial efforts to further isolate the
perceptual processes unearthed by such experiments. I believe some aspects
of this approach might place more emphasis on the importance of communicable
and utilizable technical discoveries in contemporary poetry and reduce the
emphasis on the mystification and hero worship of important figures in the
present and the past, and the resulting emphasis on the (tradition creating)
imitation and deification of these figures. The relationship between the
discoveries latent in past poetry and contemporary poetry might then be more
quickly appreciated and understood, placing more attention on the importance
of accelerating the sharing of discoveries.

For what it's worth, this thread's title is also the title of a review =
of two of my self-published books in the American Book Review last =
summer.

Although small presses have published a few of my books, for the most =
part I've found it necessary to publish on my own. Until I found a =
printer I could afford, I couldn't get my books into the trade paperback =
binding that would allow the books to get into the stores. Once I got =
perfect-bound paperbacks, I managed to get Ingram and Baker & Taylor to =
serve as wholesalers. I schedule readings at bookstores in exchange for =
their carrying my work for a few months. It's better than nothing, but =
requires a tremendous effort. Many of the people I deal with in =
bookstores who book authors events don't know enough about literature in =
general too judge my work. One of my key selling points is that I've =
read in the Establish and emerging Poets Series at The Poetry Project at =
St. Mark's Church, but I'm amazed by how few people in bookstores have =
ever heard of it; they keep thinking it's some church basement near =
their store that they don't know about.=20

Self-publishing isn't ideal, since I'm very uncomfortable playing =
salesman, but it's my only option since the distributors who could help =
me most won't accept the work of self-published authors. It's always a =
struggle, and a reliable publisher could simplify my life.

Meanwhile, I'm finding a home for a lot of my work online in electronic =
magazines. People seem to be reading my work, and I'm really gratified. =
Naturally, I hope this will eventually lead to online sales of my books. =
Because my books are listed through Ingram and Baker & Taylor, they can =
be easily ordered.

So, I guess I'm in sort of the converse position to mIEKAL aND in terms =
of publishing in electronic venues. I enjoy electronic publication, but =
I still value print. Print can last if somebody drops their internt =
service.

I'm spending the winter in Florida, so am renting a table at the Miami =
Book Fair International in November. I suspect I'll have the most =
radical inventory there, unless FC2 rents a table. If anybody has =
information on other book fairs, please post it. In the current market, =
it's tough to get any kind of work into a book store. And working in the =
avant-garde in any medium is staging a guerilla effort. You have to =
strike where you can find a place and then you have to leave because =
there's no safe place for you  or your work to stay for any length of =
time.

This is an interesting thread.  Nick's take is characteristically thoughtful
but a little too linear for my taste .Personally I don't want art to be
science. More than half of a poem's message is its _mess_, the tangle of
ambiguity and unresolvableness that makes it worth returning to again and
again.

yes---nick's ideas are valuable, but i too worry like tom about
collapsing art into science... paisley livingston proposed something
strikingly similar for literary theory (see ~literary knowledge:
humanistic inquiry and the philosophy of science~, cornell up, 1988),
and most of the theory mavens i know roundly criticized that book for
trying to make the literary object into a scientific object proper (i
actually enjoyed livingston's provocation though)... interesting
anyway to see this applied to the generative side of things, albeit
my misgivings, again, are much the same...

Nick and Tom and Joe, et. others.  I think this heads in a direction that I
looked for in e-poetry but it doesn't seem to have lived up to my hope.
Re-reading the people in _Home Sonorus_ and looking again into Bakhtin and
the later and experimental Beckett I realize I'm seeking a place on the net
where the chaotic life as process can be housed and played with poetically
or experimentally over and over again.

experiment should be taken here in Antin's sense rather than as science as
the jealousy of 'science' immediately raises hackles for some, at least in
academic and internet America..

I know there is software that would make this workable but it seems not
easily accessible to those of us with little technological or economic
means, although I think there are examples from other-world sites.

another way of making these tools work in the larger world is to establish

NETWORKS of DECENTRALIZED readingrooms

creating access to people's collections

samisdat style is not only urgent & last minute but sustainable & wise.  1 copy read by 10, makes as much or more sense than 1 copy read by 1.

so distribution of one's works is not only how many copies do you sell, but putting those copies in places of access where larger random audiences can encounter them.



& if nothing else works, putting "steal this book" on the cover seems like a sure way to get your book circulated.

j, yes, i'd say so, esp. with someone like ransom... and frye's
~anatomy of criticism~ extends this analytical development...

but, but:  livingston is moving from and motioning toward *philosophy

Joe. Here's the pertinent Piombino:

Somebody should point out to Nick Piombino that Tipler's
thesis is dependent upon the universe expanding to the Omega
point and then
collapsing in upon itself. Current data, however, suggests
that the universe will not collapse back in upon itself but
rather go on
expanding forever, a concept which carries its own
mathematical and epistemological difficulties. This renders
Tipler's book a bigger christian teleological cowpie than it
already was if that's possible.
Though Tipler is considered a 'serious' scientist who is at
his best delivering big research bucks, few take the book
seriously though I'm sure poets can find any number of lame
images and metaphors to use in their relentless quest to
discredit
their art.

Of course, the larger question concerns the immutability of
the physico/mathematical laws which are utterly universal
and
immortal one day and completely anthema the next. We just
had a good example of this with current research out of
Australia
which indicates that Einstein's theory of special relativity
is wrong because the speed of light apparently is not a
constant.
Rather than throw out the Second Law of Thermodynamics our
demiurges have begun jettisoning brother Einstein in a
series of
papers and presentations sure to net more research money and
possibly the Dynamite Prize. And most of us hadn't even come

to grips with Newton's asterisks. CP

P.S. Tipler's tripe lore and such play a significant
epistemological role in my Tale of the Tribe, Millenary's
Centos and
Eschatology of Reason. The ring of hell devoted to such
vulcanisms is a particle accelerator. CP

(for further dissemination if you want)

Yes, I think self-publishing is a tradition of its own, and a guerilla
effort, as Vernon points out.  Which is the point.  For instance, perhaps
we wouldn't have Reznikoff if he hadn't self published?  Or so he seemed to
think when he first decided to go that route.  And I think both the
self-publish and subpress collective activities developed out of a
conversation about Reznikoff.  Though subpress has turned out, for the most
part, not to be composed of self-published books.

And it was the idea behind both activities just to get more poetry out, in
print.

So Alan brings up important questions of distribution, exclusivity and
audience.  But self-publishing is not necessarily exclusive, and is one way
to develop audience.  In fact, most people I know who have done some
self-publishing tend to give away their things pretty widely.  So then they
are not sold, in that case, and not then a part of the exclusivity of what
has to have been or not have been bought.  Though that does not necessarily
exempt them from an economics of distribution, as the distribution for
either kind of poetry publication is not very wide, anyway, obviously.  So
both models are necessary and possible, no?

With regard to all this, has anybody involved in self-publishing ever
combined that with bookcrossing.com? The front page of that site explains
it; it's a way to release books into the wild, as they put it, pass them
from hand to hand, leave them in likely places for strangers to pick up...
sort of the book equivalent of a message in a bottle. Ideally, the
recipient of the book logs in and posts about it.

It's a little twee, but it could be interesting to join and then add one
or two books, in whatever form, by yourself to the mix.

For Dan Zimmerman and anyone else who placed work with A.Q. and have failed
to hear back.

Hi Dan--Just wanted to mention that I tried once again to get in touch =
with Hamadasan of the A.Q.--and nothing. I sent all of the work to =
Laurel Sicks a month or so before her break-down and she said she was =
going to use it. Hamadasan is a bird of a different stripe than Laurel. =
He's very interested in getting a return on his magazines, and no free =
copies to anyone is his policy. If you write to him again about your =
work I would suggest that you enclose $30.00.--That's the price of the =
latest issue, plus postage. Hamadasan is an honest man, so you will no =
doubt hear from him then, and you will probably be invited to continue =
to contribute.

Sorry about the uncertainties of all of this, but since Laurel left =
Japan I have been as out of touch with the A.Q. as you are.

Kathy Lou and all,

Carl Martin should certainly be on the list - author of 2 amazing
collections: _Go Your Stations, Girl_ and _Genii Over Salzburg_.  Far from
obvious b/c his poems rarely signify towards an anthologist's definition
of African American Poetry and b/c he is deeply unaffiliated and living in
Winston-Salem.  But his poems are awesome and innovative - see issues 4 &
7 of COMBO (which suggest to me that he's got enough material for
a damn good third book...)    -m.

don't really qualify as african-american...unless we're being liberal with
the definition of the "americas"...in that case, add rené depestre & kamau
brathwaite (well, since mark mcmorris was on the initial list, brathwaite
isn't a stretch)...

"Games, Po, Play, Art, and Arteroids 2.02" is an essay I've written about some of the issues
I've bumped into during the making of Arteroids, a shoot-em-up literary computer game for the
Web which I've been working on for about 16 months now. The essay and the game are at
http://vispo.com/arteroids .

The essay weighs in at about 600kb and requires IE4+, currently, plus Shockwave 8.5.1. The game
itself, as opposed to the essay, can be viewed with a Mac or PC using Netscape or IE. Best to
shut other programs down first concerning both the game and essay, if you would, please.

Nick,

What is troublesome to me in what you are saying is not essentially the
connection between science and poetry, but the implicit idea of progress. I
find the concept of progress in art inconceivable; not only between
historical periods but also among poets of the same period or even, in my
opinion, among poems of the same poet. In what way is a Coleridge poem
inferior or superior to a Frank O'hara poem or a Shakespearean sonnet or a
poem by Whitman or Pope, etc.? One may prefer one over the other; but this is
a matter of the reader's interests and tastes and also the cultural,
philosophical assumptions of the age in which the reader lives. Each of these
poets creates "completion" in his or her own way. Can an O'hara moment
"improved" upon, can a Whitman poem expanded upon?

Then poems are mainly composed of "information?" That's what you seem to be
saying or implying. After all "discovery" as something communicable is
"information." Am I misunderstanding you? I don't think that's what poetry
mainly does. In your previous post you referred to the "aura" of fragments.
How do you reconcile these two ideas?

>that such discoveries could be disseminated and
>employed in future poetry. I think of such Dada ideas as cutting up a
>newspaper, shaking around the words and then letting them fall to the table,

Unless the second artist re-imagines the cut-up process (and makes it his/her
own), the "technique" itself functions as a cliche, the opposite of
"progress."

You also imply that a scientific approach to poetry will abolish the cult of
personality or authority? Is that what happens in science? No heroes? No
authorities?

All in all, an interesting post.

Murat

I distictly recall a fund being set up for Cid--bank account, etc.  last
year or year before.  If someone (not me--I'm not good at this) could search
the archives and find those postings...Or if those folks could please once
again give details to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.  Shizumi
will eventually go blind if she doesn't get this operation and any help
given via this list would be a God-send.

When we took Jerry Rothenberg out to see Cid he was sporting broken glasses
and wearing shoes with holes in them.  He's selling his archives off bit by
bit in order to pay bills and survive because they have nothing else.  It's
serious, folks.

I agree with you, Tom. I don't want art to be science either. I don't think
it is possible or desirable. What I was trying to get at is the issue of
distribution. One of the ideals of science is to distribute data as
generously and and as rapidly as possible. When we look at our writing work
as collectible objects, I feel this "slows down" the acceleration of
exchange. It causes us to look at poems as unique constructs, or to overly
focus on them as unique objects. I agree that the mysteriousness of poems,
"the tangle of ambiguity and unresolvableness" is one of the key factors in
making them "worth returning to again and again." This viewpoint is a strong
factor in the pleasure of poetry and you put it very well. My question had
to do with this very mysteriousness and what relationship there might be
between the private and enigmatic character of individual creation (the
unknowable formulas that makes certain poetry so collectible) and how this
outlook effects the reception of poetry and the way poetry is exchanged. I
knew that I was risking eliciting all the thorny issues that make the
separation of art and science so important, a separation I also strongly
agree with. There is a tendency in science (and many other areas of
exploration) to push for uniformity of thinking- something that poetry
offers a respite from in some ways. The tendency to overly focus on the
mysterious "secret ingredients" in poetry, however, the "new improved
formulas" that make our products "irresistable and exciting" ("So crunchy
and delicious I'll be you can't eat just one!") offers us a sure-fire escape
from the conformist rituals of science only to throw us more deeply into the
seductive arms of our advertisement ridden consumer culture. Once we cuddle
up with consumer culture as poets, however, we have all the problems that go
with marketing, distribution and sales with none of the (occasional)
advantages. If given a choice I would opt for an attitude towards the
objects of poetry that might be in some ways more akin to certain idealistic
aspects of the exchange of information that is utilized in the sciences over
the hopelessly dead end values implicit in consumer culture.

My thanks to Joe Brennan for forwarding this response from CP. What I found
interesting about the Tipler book was its eccentricity. I hope CP does not
think that because I mentioned Tipler's ideas that I agree with them or even
understand them or found very much of value in them for poets or anybody
else. Actually, I'm quite sure that very few poets, if any, would find, as
CP puts it "any number of lame images and metaphors to use in their
relentless quest to discredit their art." I also don't agree with CP at all
that poets have a relentless quest to discredit their art. Not the ones I
know or know about, anyway. There are certainly some uninteresting poems out
there, but I don't see that as a quest to discredit the field of poetry.  I
certainly thought many of the religious references that Tipler employs and
the book's claustrophobic enclosure within the ideas and images of
Christianity painful to read. What I did find interesting was the phenomenon
of a respected scientist flying in the face of more or less everything his
colleagues hold dear, specifically in "scientifically" trying to "prove" the
existence of immortality. Tipler points out that "resurrection has been
inconsistent with the accepted physics of the day for two thousand years."
There was a wild, desperate, career, self and assumption immolating aspect
to this book that I found fascinating, especially coming from a scientist.
It is very strange and fascinating what people will do to escape from the
fear of death and to offer other people an escape from such fear. I have to
admit to finding many ideas fascinating that I don't agree with, or
sometimes don't even completely understand.

The speed of light not being always constant doesn't surprise me very much
when not very much else about reality is always constant. It is exciting to
hear about this assertion on the part of the Australian scientists.

It would be interesting to learn more about CP's Tale of the Tribe,
Millenary's Cantos and Eschatology of Reason.

Sorry if someone mentioned these poets already, I've
been offline, but you need to have Russell Atkins (see
recent issue of CRAYON) and C.S. Giscombe.  And what
about the guy that Maria Damon presented on in Maine a
couple years ago?  The SF 60s poet who was half
Jewish?  The name is escaping me at the moment though
I loved the presentation and his work...

Nick,

I know how difficult it can be to get work around.  I'm 49 years old and
still haven't managed to publish a full-length book of my own writing. So it
goes.

But I'm just not comfortable with science as a model for distribution.  Art
and data are not synonymous terms. Writing--if not the writer-- often
benefits from lag time, from a slowing down of the acceleration of exchange.
At the level of the text, "experimental" writing literally enacts this
slowing down by disrupting more expedient conduits of exchange.  As you well
know. As it is above, so it is below.  No matter how a bundle of innovative
poetry makes its way in the world ,it has to make its case one reader at a
time and it does that by problematizing the relationship between the writer
and the reader.  This dynamic is at the heart of our distribution problem.
And talk about a practice resistant to consumer culture!

The self-publishing tradition includes Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, Walt
Whitman, Mark Twain and Emily Dickinson, for starters. Considering the
caliber of the writers who self-published their work before anybody "got
it," I really wonder why publishers and agents place such a stigma on it.
Economic control appears to be the primary reason. They can't be "saving us"
from  "bad work," since I see enough of it in the bookstores.

Distribution of any kind is a problem. Self-publishing writers or
self-producing musicians (e.g., Sun Ra, Don Pullen, Wadada Leo Smith and
many others) try to work on all fronts, until they find an opening. Giving
away much of the work is part of the promotion  It is also part of the
confused economics the current system generates because the avant-garde has
so few members that a paying fan soon becomes a friend who gets free copies.
I give away a lot of copies in the hope that one reader will talk to another
and persuade them to buy a copy.

IMHO, it's better to self-publish and give your work a chance to find its
place in the world than to let it rot in your desk drawer. If I stopped
trying and did the latter, my wife would never be able to tolerate my level
of frustration. Aside from literary ambition, I guess you'd say I
self-publish so that other key areas of my life will remain fulfilling, in
addition to the work itself.

I would have to say that both models are necessary, since self-publishing
writers don't have a single working model they can consistently rely on.

Warfare & Poetry - one of the major pre-occupations of mankind.=20

The threat of major war amongst the leading industrial states may have
receded. However, a brief look at current affairs reminds us daily of
the continuing risks of war around the world=20

                        in the Middle East, the former Soviet Union,
Africa,                         South and East Asia and, of course, in
southern Europe.=20
        =09
                        And from War comes Poetry.=20

War Poems challenge all aspects of the societies in which they occur=20

and the study of war poems, therefore, deserves careful attention=20
to gain a greater understanding of the complex questions raised:

        - Why do war poems occur?=20

        - How might war poems be prevented, avoided or resolved?=20

        - How has the character of warfare and war poems changed over
time?=20

        - Can wars be 'just'? If only for the poetry?

        - How will new challenges such as peacekeeping and the
information             revolution affect the use of poetry during
conflict?=20

        - How have developments in modern poetics affected the military
professional?=20

=20

Can =93lessons from the past=94 facilitate our understanding of =
contemporary
conflicts and assessment of future poems created during periods of war?=20

While United States Military Academy at West Point suggests a long
history of rules and laws of composition, the Poetics Program stresses
poiesis -- the actual making or doing: poetry as process. Every doing
carries the potential of something new, emergent, something not already
predicated by poetics. Practice overtakes theory, practice changes
theory.=20

And not just writing practice, but performance practice, the performance
of war.

To make war is to produce meaning and not reproduce (eradicate) a
pre-existing meaning. To destroy is to not remain subjected to a meaning
that supposedly precedes rationality. War or poetry is never about
something, it is something. Writing is not the living repetition of
life, or death where the case may be made.=20

The author is that which gives the disquieting language of war and
poetry its unities and disunities, its knot of cadence and chaos, its
insertion into the hot zone.=20

All warfare is conducted haphazardly. Now some people might say the
situation (of poetry and war) is not very encouraging but one must reply
that it is not meant to encourage those who say that!

War Poems are a challenging multi-disciplinary genera. Our educators
have chosen to draw on military, diplomatic, international, strategic
poems as well as on self described anti-war poems. Our specialist
interests extend across many regions of the poetry spectrum, ranging
from all genres of war poetry from Europe and Africa to North America
and Asia-Pacific. These interests also extend across time with
colleagues focusing on topics ranging from the dynamics of ancient and
medieval epic poetry to contemporary problems such as the conflicts in
the War Against Terror.

War Poems are inherently a controversial subject and we seek to provide
a forum for study in which individuals are encouraged to think hard
about these poems before reaching their own conclusions in the vastness
of all possible dimension.

Compulsory Core Courses


The Causes of War Poems


This course is an introduction to thinking about the causes of war
poems. It aims to make students aware of the philosophical background to
debates about causation. To familiarize students with a variety of
approaches to the causation and compositions of war poems, and to
examine the merits and weaknesses of historical sociology as an overall
framework.


The Conduct of War Poetry

This course is designed to explore the dynamics of warfare at the
strategic and operational levels up to the age of Napoleon, and to
highlight changes and continuities in the way war poems has been
composed.=20


The Experience of War

The aims of this course are to explore the various experiences of war -
individual, group and community, direct and indirect, battlefield and
home front, military and civilian, male and female, and empirical and
cultural through the effect of poems. The course also aims to both
encourage reflection on the meaning and value of experience and also to
promote an understanding of experience in relation to other aspects of
war.


Contemporary Security Issues

The course will cover some of the major debates within the field
(generated from the disputes between realists poets and liberal minded
poets) as they are played out through contemporary security issues. It
will also examine the types of security issues which have come to
prominence in the Post-September 11th era. There is a particular focus
on intra-state conflict and the issue of intervention and
collaborations.

this course are to provide students with an introduction to the main
skills that are necessary for the BA Literature Studies program.

=20

=20

War Poems and Society


This course aims to provide you with an understanding of the key issues

Nick suggests a model of poetic production in which the aim is not to
accumulate attention within a subculture by imitating the appropriate
(i.e. high-attention accumulator) forebear, but rather to contribute to
the general body of knowledge by experimenting with the assumptions and
methods of forebears without respect to their place in the league
standings (which to abandon the frame of science in order to indulge in an
metaphor from the market could be looked at as value investing). Murat
counters that experimenting with the assumptions and methods of forebears
is a recipe for academic (i.e. mechanical and cliched) writing. But Murat,
what was Ted Berrigan doing in The Sonnets when he took Frank O'Hara's use
of times of day literally? The bear whose name has not been mentioned in

Well. I was saying that some poets use the dominant paradigm of the sciences
and attendant technologies as reservoirs of images and metaphors to tart up
and, I think at least in their minds, make new, what are tired cultural,
pseudo-intellectual and emotional bromides. Paul Lake, a devotee of the
Nursing Home School of Poetry, a few months back offered up a little giblet
very much in this vein. A dispassionate look at Jorie Graham's poetry reveals
the same kind of willy-nilly borrowing for emotional or aesthetic effect.
Science because of its supposed universality and objectivity is often used by
poets to disguise sentimentality like one would disguise rot in meat. Nick
P., himself, has been known to build a faux intellectual/poetic construct on
the back of cosmological and physical concepts.

It must be observed that people in the hard sciences and mathematics are in
general a very conservative, even reactionary, lot, so any perceived
perception of a break by Tipler as regards his fellow scientists would be
exaggerated. Certainly, not while he retains the kind of clout that brings in
research money. His books are published by big trade houses and university
presses whose editor's know that they risk little in letting a Tipler vent in
any vein he desires. Further, Barrow and Tipler's book, Anthropic
Cosmological Principle, a book every bit as teleological as P. of Im., is
much admired by the scientific community, especially the American community,
which even to this day -- and given current ecological conditions -- remains
resolutely ungrounded in European Transcendental philosophy, i.e., how the
limitations of our perceptions qua knowledge of the 'object' or the 'other '
impact on how we can know that object. Tipler's books demonstrate just how
misplaced our enthusiasm and faith in the sciences are. Books like Tipler's,
Barrow's, Murray's, Herrnstein's, Kelly's, Casti's, Shockley's, Drexler's,
and on and on (for there are hundreds of them), put on display the most
dangerous absurdities and eccentricities that drive the sciences and that
impact on us all through technology. What seems to have become obvious only
recently is the retrograde nature of the scientific method e.g. seeking
environmental answers through the same methodologies that fucked up the
environment in the first place. The way the scientific method interfaces with
its subject is temporal, partial and tautological. Its 'successes' are
limited, perceptually and technologically, and contain a downside that
broaches no compromise. Books like the ones mentioned above are, especially
for the laymen, windows into what the recent environmental developments
reveal -- the brutish failure of the scientific method. The failure of the
sciences is a systemic and epistemological failure, a failure of a method too
little criticized. This failure has never been more obvious than in the last
40 years. Its not a matter of 'good' science vs. 'bad' science, but the
inherent limitations of the scientific method now that those limitations are
magnified against the planetary paradigm. I invite interest in my work,
Deconstructing the Demiurge: Tale of the Tribe is available unabridged
(though recent changes have been made) at FlashPoint Magazine Number 5. 19
pages of the Eschatology of Reason should appear soon in the new issue of
David Hickman's Trope. A little of the Millenary's Centos appears in
Anastasios Kozaitis' Poet of the Day series and an early issue of Trope,
though under other titles. Carlo Parcelli

        Lets not forget Ezra Pound's edict for the poet, as the
scientist to provide an accurate report. This is not meant so literal

I was referring only to Jonas: His ethnicity was an issue for him.

From his writings and self-spun mythologies, he was anything but Black.
Seemed many tried to get him to admit that he was.  He could have been
anything, everything.  Omni-American.

(props to Albert Murray, and Elizabeth Alexander's line "omni omni Albert
Murray.)

I find Jonas' resistances fascinating because of how all this rhythmic
tension spills out all over his work, Eargasms, etc.

My intention was not to make S.J. turn in his grave.  Would you argue that
he doesn't belong on a list of African-American poets?  I'm very curious,
beginning the planning of a conference in which S.J. will be a central
figure.

My mailto:kenningpoetics@hotmail.com address recently and unexpectedly went
to pieces, so I've decided to delete it.  My sole email address is now
pdurgin@acsu.buffalo.edu - if you've tried to contact me via the hotmail
address within the last month or two, please try again via the acsu account.

Lastly, a gentle reminder that Kenning's 13th issue is now out and about.
Order via direct mailorder (address below), or with Small Press
Distribution.  Kennings 8, 10, 11, and 12 are also still available (see
www.durationpress.com/kenning for details on these issues) and even ripe for
course adoption - contact me via email for special rates on textbook orders.

I'm afraid I disagree, Murat.  I think all fields progress in two ways: (1)
covering greater expanses of knowledge and (2) expressing that coverage more
compressedly.  Poetry today is vastly more advanced than it was in Virgil's
time because, at its best, it covers a much larger world, and is more dense,
because of devices new since Virgil's time which reduce the number of words
needed to say something (as in modern visual poetry)--and because of all the
poetry that has preceded our poetry and which allows us to say more with
less through allusions.

A simple comparison would be to music.  It HAS to be more advanced today
than it was two thousand years ago because of all the new instruments, and
computers we now have, and because of the variety of harmonics that have
been devised, etc., etc., in the past two thousand years.  And consider all
the things that can be done in illumagery (as I call visual art) that could
not be done two thousand years ago.

I don't think we are necessarily superior to our predecessors, but our art
is superior to theirs (except that theirs now has had time to grow through
its use in later art, and commentaries, and its carrying more and more of
its fading era with it).
The Pyramids aren't just piles of blocks, they are Ancient Egypt.

Sure, the same way my poem, "glub nuts/ for/ diddle diddle," can be,
although it would take a lot more work.  Or are you really saying that all
poems are equal?

Arielle--

The original post is on the list serve, it was sent by Gerry Schwartz,
the original no longer exists on the website.

There is a photo of Jim at:
http://wowcool.com/deptex/
which leads to other info.

I'm not sure if you knew, but some of this reputation might stem from
the backdrop, a real active group of poets & artists at that moment,
which is how I got into this whole gig. A poet in niskayuna with
multiple books on Black Sparrow Press, a guy named Hank who used to be
in a famous hardcore band & went on to create his own press to publish
himself (tho he did contribute a book by the former co-editor, with my
friend Rich Blevins, of Zelot/Tansy, Bill Shields. Human Shrapnel, was
a book which needed to be done to combat the crappy Vietnam Academic (in
all senses of the word) poets such as Bruce Weigl) who was around
regularly to see a relative (uncle) who owned a bookstore in
Schenectady. There was also an extremely important magazine called Fact
Sheet five, who fed us updates on all the newest work & (after a while
begged people to take) free issues once he was done with them

We are both speaking of the same person which means I graduated a few
years previous from the same school.This is curious, I had no idea!

here is a post I did on their message board
---------------
Jim let me know things could be done; that is what I thank him for. All
I needed was a 32 ounce of coffee, maybe two
or three. I remember making these real small tape loops for a reel to
reel & playing drums for BCN on a machine in the
back room of the half-moon at a show where we all were allowed to play.
Jason, Otto, Ed, Jim, Joe Carandi, I forget
who else, the acoustics were enormously disturbing & led to a full on
call to the police for noise. I remember a guy
from that event took what he learned & went & formed the Fun Factory
(not the current pop band, but noise folks) in
Buffalo.

As a friend of Ed's, I looped in & out of contact with Jim when I lived
in Albany. My memories are vague, nearly
absent in periods of the late 80's & early 90's but I thot he was
working with Sam McPheeters / Born Against one time
I ran into him but never found out if anything came of that. The
occasional talks we had, usually late & long, if they
happened, were best. We were planning to rehash an idea Jim executed
years ago with Pavement Saw Press which I
started in Albany (it has turned into the second largest independent
literary publisher in Ohio). Jim's version was a
"action figure," a skinhead who I'll keep nameless, inside a meat
container with a price on him which was at Dave Erl's
for years (& I don't think was ever for sale). The version we have been
working on is a meat issue of our journal,
wrapped in a container, with a per ounce literary value.

As I moved to Philly & then started to tour with my writing I still ran
into Jim a few times. The last time I bought him a coffee at LuLu's & we
talked about oversentimentality & the press's newly installed wall of
shame (pasted up horrific submissions of pure poetic poop).
------------------

After talking with Jim's brother last night, it became apparent that,
altho undocumented, there were plenty of folks his ideas were "lent" to.



Be well

I'm sorry, but can someone repost the original
obituary, or backchannel it to me?  I think I missed
it, and only after reading David Baratier's posting do
I realize that I think I might have known Jim--I think
I went to high school with him, or at least with his
friends.

The band he was in, the Brown Cuts Neighbors, were
formed one day in gym class when a bunch of us were
sitting around trying to avoid running the track at
Niskayuna High School in Schenectady, NY (this was the
late 80s).  Jason Martin and some other guys (Rob
Goodale, I think?) were talking about starting a band,
even though they didn't really play any instruments.
We thought it was a joke.  Then they came out with a
little tape--"Broken Down Like a Bean"--and gave out
copies with handmade covers around school...I think I
still have mine.  The songs were totally insane and
wonderful: one of my favorites was called "Running
Naked on Peyote" and it still gets stuck in my head to
this day.

I moved away from the Capital District of upstate NY
after high school, and so it was always amazing to me
to go back to Albany and see BCN written up as a
serious avant-noise collective in the local papers.
To me they were always just a bunch of the craziest
guys in my high school.  I went to a show they did
once on Niska-Day, the annual town pride festival, in
which they played alongside other, far more
conventional bands.  BCN were nuts, of course, playing
conceptual hardcore until some school administrator
pulled the plug.  It was a great event.

I'm sorry to hear about Jim.

I wasn't aware yesterday of how snippy I sounded. Or chirpy. Gimlet
chickadee-dee-dee. Today I want to vote for Nick's move to call into
question all unexamined models for consuming, producing, and distributing
this hybrid poetico-critical text-paste. Some givens:

if poetry didn't exist we'd invent it -- or rather we'd go on using words
in non-standard ways giving pleasure and insight (or inhibiting pleasure
and insight! for whatever honestly-come-by reason)

Poetry exists

and is and has been written by poets

who (because poetry transmits affect apparently by magic) come to be seen
as magic people

by people who come later and want to use words in non-standard ways but
for whatever honestly-come-by reason have been inhibited, scolded, held up
to unreasonable standards

so they appeal to the authority of the ancient magic people

some of whom are still alive

----

What gets lost (what was never found) is an explicit common understanding
of the goal of using language in non-standard ways. A doubt I have about
Nick's experimental model is that it doesn't explicitly account for
affection, self-interest, or deviousness -- in short for psychology -- for
gaming around the context of these methods of communication so liable to
give the consumer (wrong word!) the feeling they're being put on.

(On the other hand, I could take what Nick applies to texts and their
creators, this model of tinkering with how one responds oneself to a
received method, and apply it to texts and their audiences, and understand
it as tinkering with the response one gets from others.)

In any event, I'm grateful to Nick for raising the subject of unexamined
assumptions -- and I would hope any and all will modify my list of givens
for this strange but conventional human activity of communicating
differently.

<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Nick suggests a model of poetic production in which the aim is not to
<DIV></DIV>&gt;accumulate attention within a subculture by imitating the appropriate
<DIV></DIV>&gt;(i.e. high-attention accumulator) forebear, but rather to contribute to
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the general body of knowledge by experimenting with the assumptions and
<DIV></DIV>&gt;methods of forebears without respect to their place in the league
<DIV></DIV>&gt;standings (which to abandon the frame of science in order to indulge in an
<DIV></DIV>&gt;metaphor from the market could be looked at as value investing). Murat
<DIV></DIV>&gt;counters that experimenting with the assumptions and methods of forebears
<DIV></DIV>&gt;is a recipe for academic (i.e. mechanical and cliched) writing. But Murat,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;what was Ted Berrigan doing in The Sonnets when he took Frank O'Hara's use
<DIV></DIV>&gt;of times of day literally? The bear whose name has not been mentioned in
<DIV></DIV>&gt;this discussion is Hal Bloom, whose misprision encompasses both Nick's and
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Murat's version of influence.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Nick, I understand your wish not to be flown remote control by the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;classics, but couldn't a writer come by an interest in the so-called
<DIV></DIV>&gt;greats honestly, i.e. by genuine attraction to their language, with
<DIV></DIV>&gt;friction in their understanding?
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;And Murat, I understand your rejection out-of-hand of the concept of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;progress in the arts, but isn't that also an old-fogey rejection of new
<DIV></DIV>&gt;work?
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;To answer my own questions: Ted Berrigan was misunderstanding Frank
<DIV></DIV>&gt;O'Hara, and therefore making his work new. Writers respond to others' work
<DIV></DIV>&gt;differently every time, and it's probably only a productive mistake to set
<DIV></DIV>&gt;up any art as an absolute standard. And yes, that is an old-fogey
<DIV></DIV>&gt;rejection of new work.

<P>Steve Jonas' psychosexual connections to money&nbsp;and magic, mostly via Pound&nbsp;in the former term, and both Spicer and Wieners&nbsp;in the latter would seem to cut a figure at some remove from the more grandly "street"&nbsp;likes of Amiri Baraka.&nbsp; Jonas isn't thought "black" because he didn't approach "black topics" in any but the most oblique ways.&nbsp; Being gay, also, sets up categorical distinctions within "black arts"&nbsp;that&nbsp;become increasingly complex.&nbsp; His pansexual concern for equity in all senses of commerce place him at the very beginnings of lawful creation, rather than in a generalized social mileu.&nbsp; His work is as particular in aspect as Hammurabi's code - and as essential.&nbsp; To categorize him by the patina of his skin suggests parity with an Egyptian sophistication out of Beirut in the 30s, or better, Muslim Spain of the 12th century, where Qabbalistic study equally&nbsp;was as rife as the red of a tomato.&nbsp; But in terms

If you're interested in the traditional printing model of an actual artifact
that can be held in the hand and then stored on a shelf, Print On Demand
offers a way for anyone to self-publish a hardcover book with jacket or
softcover book that looks no different than the materials coming from any
large commercial press.  For a grand or so, IUniverse, XLibris or
1stBooks.com will happily take your money and get your book out -- there.
Once it's in their system, the book will be available from Amazon, bn.com,
any independent bookstore and even the chain stores will special order it.
(It's helpful to make the book returnable and available for the standard
trade discount but even if you do neither, Amazon will still list it.)

So the problem is no longer access to production or even access to
distribution.  The problem is visibility.  There's a huge amount of noise and
clutter in our culture.  Rising into view, how do you do it?  Movie studios
are putting $20-50 million behind their films saturating every available
avenue of promotion, and doing it every day.  The same goes for record
companies.  TV shows.  Large books publishers do so at a smaller scale.  How
does anyone know your little books is available?

Visibility, on the most gross scale, becomes a question of money.  If you're
willing to put some behind the book -- reviewer copies, targetted mailings,
display ads and the like -- you might get some recognition.  (1stBooks has
been running full page ads in the NY Times Book Review for groups of books.
I don't know off hand what the full page rate is but it can't be cheap.  It
might be worth it -- apparently is worth it -- to some of these
self-published authors to spend another 6, 7 hundred or a thousand dollars to
be one of the 10 books in the ad.)

At the gym I frequent (alas, it's true) they have several televisions set
up with closed captioning. I find the CNN channel the most
interesting, because they broadcast live . . . which is, the typists can't
possibly keep up. Many interesting results, in the babelfish mode.

Someone was broadcasting from "tell a veeve" the other day.

Tell a veeve is kind of like... it must be apocryphal... the anecdote
about the captioner unfamiliar with Nazi Germany who assumed that all
those people were waving happily at their leader and saying, "Hi, Hitler!"

No, I wouldn't argue that at all.  I'd include him.
And whether Jonas spins in his grave or grins from the Great Beyond, a
conference on him would be awesome, gloriously important, and a long time
coming.  He deserves the attention.

I claim Jonas as part of my own mixed-up literary and blood lineage without
"removing" him from where Stephen Ellis suggests he "really belongs," which
is, unless I've misread the results of his queerly veiled Egypto-paper
bag-test treatise, with white poets/readers, all on site in Boston, my
insanely racist hometown.   I just feel Jonas, his queerness, "otherness,"
his street running hustle, his lovely work with sound, all in Boston, in
spite of the FOUL things he's written about Blackness and Black people,
while all up in the rhythm of what he disrespected.  What do Weiners et. al.
have to do with that?   If with them is where Jonas belongs...where there is
affinity, there is also complicity.

I've been consumed with thoughts of Leo Felton  in relation to Jonas, and
separate from him, the fact of skin privilege, "milieu," the idea or
illusion of having a choice in the matter, the horrid jealousy such a choice
is regarded with by those without it, how horribly guarded the fact of a
choice and subsequent decision, by those who have it, etc.

It's all so very complex.

Goodbye Patty, Farewell


Willy, an employee of McDonald's
Jimmy, an employee of Wendy's
Leia, an employee of Burger King
Vladimir, an employee of Taco Bell



It is NIGHT.  Willy, Jimmy, Leia, and Vladimir all stand huddled in an empty
paved urban parking lot.  They are all wearing their respective employer's
uniforms.  They warm their hands from a couch fire burning before them.



Willy: [to Jimmy]  I will lend to it you for awhile.  For you to love it
while it lives and mourn for him when it's dead. Maybe for twelve or
fourteen years, or maybe two or three. But will you,' till I call it back,
take care of it for me?

Jimmy: [announcing, as if either preaching or hard of hearing] ITS SANTA HAT
AND STOCKING ARE STOWED WITH CARE. MORE SO RIGHT NOW IT'S HIT ME.  IT'S NO
LONGER THERE.

Leia:  [to Willy] They will give it anything and everything you want. That
is a lot more than I can do. I hope it remembers me because I will always
remember it.

Jimmy: [again shouting] WHERE I EXPECT IT AND THINK IT WILL BE....  [He
sits.]  GOD, HOW THIS CHRISTMAS IS SO SAD AND HEARTBREAKING FOR ME.

Vladimir:  [to Leia, nudging her] He'll bring his charms to gladden it and
it'll always have his memories as solace for its grief.  I cannot promise he
will stay, since all from Earth return.  But there are lessons taught below
I want it to learn.

Willy:  [to Leia, shaking] I've looked the whole world over, in search of
teachers fit, And from the folk that crowd's life's land, I have chosen it.
Now will you give it all your love, Nor think the labor vain, Nor hate me
when I come to take it back again.

Jimmy: [still shouting] IT WAS MY GIFT ELEVEN CHRISTMAS DAYS SHOULD BE, BUT
THREE WEEKS TO THIS DAY IT SUDDENLY LEFT ME.

Leia:  [to Willy] Once in a lifetime a true friend comes along. Thank you my
beloved for being that friend.  I will love you forever.

Jimmy: [scream, go ahead]  AND SO THE PRESENTS I MIGHT HAVE WANTED ARE NO
WHERE TO BE, FOR THE ONLY THING TRULY WANTED WOULD BE IT STILL BESIDE ME.

Willy:  [crying] I fancied that I heard them say "Thy Will be Done," For all
the joys it will bring, the risk of grief we'll run.  We'll shelter it with
tenderness we'll love it while we may And for the happiness we've known
forever grateful stay But should it call it back much sooner than we've
planned, We'll brave the bitter grief that comes, and try to understand.
If, by our love, we've managed, your wishes to achieve In memory of it we
loved, to help us while we grieve, When our faithful bundle departs this
world of strife, We'll have yet another and love it all its life.

Vladimir:  [whispering to Leia]  When it's gone nothing will be the same. My
heart will be two.  Part with it and part with me.

Jimmy: [we know, yell]  GIVE ME IT AS A GIFT WHAT SEEMED NOT LONG AGO, AND
BROUGHT BACK TO IT MY GIFT THAT I SO MISS SO.

Willy:  [still crying]  When it leaves I'll try not to cry. It was a loving,
loyal friend.  I'm sure the angels will open to it with open arms. They will
make it free of suffering.

Leia:  [looking upward] It was so pretty and so full of joy. We miss it and
its love for life.  We miss it so terribly. If we could turn the clock back,
it would be here by our sides. We will always love & miss it. Sleep tight.
May it rest in heaven.

Jimmy: [now singing]  REST EASY AND PLAY FREE, FOR SOON I'LL BE WITH IT AND
SEE; THAT ALL IS WELL AS WE MEET IN THE RAINBOWS AND STAY SIDE BY SIDE INTO
ETERNITY FOR THAT WOULD TRULY BE HEAVEN TO ME.

Ok--Went back to the archives and scouted out a message dated Sept. 1, 1999,
posted to this list by Burt Kimmelman, who must be on vacation, God bless
him.

In the midst of a debate about haves/have-nots on this list, Kimmelman
forwarded this information from John Phillips:

This information is still accurate.
I give a redaction:

For those interested in contributing anything less than $500.00, please do
not send checks, as a check-cashing fee of $30.00 is charged.  The best
thing to do is send cash directly to Corman at:

Cid Corman
Fukuoji-cho 80
Utano, Utano-ku
Kyoto, 616,
Japan.

The absolute best thing to do would be a cash transfer directly to Cid's
account.  Address:

Cid Corman c/o Kyoto Shinyo Kinko Bank
Omuro Branch, Omuro Ukyo-ku
Kyoto 616-8208
Japan
account# 095-0010328
bank tel. # 81-75-462-9670

Once again, your help would be greatly appreciated.  When you send
donations, please add a note that says that this money is for Shizumi's eye
operation.

I want to clarify something: Cid and Shizumi no longer own their own
business.  Shizumi's family maintains the business, but her brother and
sister are also getting too old to make a go of it.  That's why the
situaltion is growing even more tenuous with each passing year.  Jesse Glass

isn't "thought black" by whom?  i don't think i've ever been part of

it must be possible to think about a poet in his/her entirety --not
occluding an ethnoracial aspect in favor of a coterie aspect --it's
the whole picture that makes the work/life interesting, compelling,
etc.  it's not a racial "division" to include someone's racial
politics in a discussion.

I happened to come across a reprint of the original edition of a book by one
our most esteemed peers, Walt Whitman, who seemed to have much to say on the
topic of poetics-

"Of all nations the United States with veins full of poetical stuff most
need poets and doubtless have the greatest and use them the greatest. Their
President shall not be their common referee so much as their poets shall. Of
all mankind the great poet is the equable man."

"The poet sees for a certainty how one not a great artist may be just as
sacred and perfect as the greatest artist...The power to destroy or remould
is freely used by him but never the power of attack. What is past is
past....He is not one of the chorus....he does not stop for any
regulations...he is the president of regulation....The poet shall not spend
his time in unneeded work...The messages of great poets to each man and
woman are, Come to us on equal terms. Only then can you understand us, We
are no better than you. What we enclose you enclose, What we enjoy you may
enjoy. Did you suppose there could be only one Supreme? We affirm there can
be unnumbered Supremes...The American bards shall be marked for generosity
and affection and for encouraging competitors...They shall be
Kosmos...without monopoly or secrecy...glad to pass any thing to any
one...hungry for equals night and day.... Exact science and its practical
movements are no checks on the greatest poet but always his encouragement
and support.... The anatomist chemist astronomer geologist phrenologist
spiritualist mathematician historian and lexicographer are not poets, but
they are the lawgivers of poets and their construction underlies the
structure of every perfect poem....In the beauty of poems are the tuft and
final applause of science....It is also not consistent with the reality of
the soul to admit that there is anything in the known universe more divine
than men and women....The attitude of great poets is to cheer up slaves and
horrify despots....The prescient poet projects himself centuries ahead and
judges performer or performance after the changes of time. Does it live
through them? Does it hold on untired? Will the same style and the direction
of genius to similar points be satisfactory now? Has no new discovery in
science or arrival at superior planes of thought and judgement and behavior
fixed him or his so that either can be looked down upon?....A great poem is
for ages and ages in common and for all degrees and complexions and all
departments and sects and for a woman as much as a man and a man as much as
a woman...Has anyone fancied he could sit at last under some due authority
and rest satisfied with explanations and realize and be content and full? To
no such terminus does the greatest poet bring....the elder encourages the
younger and shows him how.. They two shall launch off fearlessly together
till the new world fits an orbit for itself and looks unabashed on the
lesser orbits of the stars and sweeps through the ceaseless rings and shall
never be quiet again...the will soon be no more priests....the gangs of
kosmos and prophets en masse shall take their place. A new order shall arise
and they shall be the priests of man, and every man shall be his own
priest..."

(from Whitman's original introduction to -Leaves of Grass-)

And from the text itself:

"Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all
poems,
You shall possess the good of the earth and sun....there are millions of
suns left,
You shall no longer take things at second or third hand....nor look through
the eyes of the dead....nor feed on the spectres in books,
You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,
You shall listen to all sides and filter them from yourself.

I have heard what the talkers were talking....the talk of the beginning and
the end,
But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.

There was never any more inception than there is now,
Nor any more youth or age than there is now;
Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.

Urge and urge and urge,
Always the procreant urge of the world."

(selected from Walt Whitman's -Leaves of Grass- the first (1855) edition
Edited by Malcolm Cowley (NY Viking Press, 1959)

I'm late joining in to the non-musical cateorgies, but Maria's post made me
think maybe not too late? (Maria, please tell us more about Sussan Deyhim!)
This one's about the movies. Books maybe will come later ...

"All About Lily Chou-Chou," a great, disturbing recent Japanese movie about
teens & "the social." Almost makes you want to avoid human beings at all
costs. But it's actually not a misanthropic film; just unflinching, and
focused on an age (teen-) when desire and peer pressure (raw socialization?)
are almost completely unmitigated by any developed sense of
ethics/metaphysics/or anything else for that matter (although you can see
them slowly, vaguely crystalizing for some of the characters). Very
stylized, visually like a contemporary Clockwork Orange, but much prettier,
with lusher greens. Me, Nada & Anna Malmude saw this together at the Quad
(world's coldest movie theater?), and me & Anna (Nada was spared high
school) basically said "Oh, yeah, that was it, all right!" It brought back a
very unpleasant flood of memories from high school, one fucked up
event/person after another. Here's the official site, which has the same
"look" as the movie:
http://www.lily-chou-chou.com/

"Devdas," 3-1/2 hours, the most expensive and lavish Hindi/Bollywood
production in history. Nada and I saw this at the Eagle Theater in Queens,
which is HUGE, and which was completely packed--weeks into the run. Probably
you have to love epic movies, musicals, historical costume drama, and
romance flicks (or Bollywood flicks) to appreciate this movie, but maybe
not. Nada and I thought it was one of the greatest movies we'd ever seen,
but we tend to like things like Bye-bye Birdie, Caligula, The Ten
Commandments, and Kismet. (Has anyone seen Kismet recently?) I got the
Devdas soundtrack afterwards, but I think the music is not so outragously
great as I thought while watching the movie--it's the movie itself, the
dance scenes, the costumes, scenery, etc. Here's a review, which will give
you the plot (since I didn't):
http://www.indiafm.com/previews/02/devdas/index.shtml

That's all I've seen in theaters recently. Would love recommendations!

Gary,

Your list encourages me to chip in a few names:

A.I. (Artificial Intelligence), a movie you'll love or you'll hate. It is the
most disturbing single movie I saw since last year (I was going to say
"2001"), both manipulative but also profound, a horrifying fairy tale/science
fiction. I don't think anybody understands better than Spielberg the Faustian
bargain modern technology (in his case cloning, the increasing ambiguity
between copy and original) presents to us and lures us with.

Masculin-Feminine (Goddard); I saw it again on tape a few weeks ago. Superb.
There is quite a long scene shot as an interview in which the "interviewer"
(a man) is asking a woman (in the form of questions) to give up pursuing a
man who doesn't love her and turn to the interviewer, who loves her; she
doesn't budge a bit. Both heartbreaking and very analytical. Directos today
are still catching up with Goddard (The Limey, a great movie inspired by
Goddard).

Earth (by an Indian director whose name I forgot); part of a trllogy, of
which I saw only this one. It is about the split of the British Empire into
India and Pakistan in 1948 -the brutal religious violence among friends it
causes. Very difficult to get this guy's work, but from what I saw worth it.

Do you remember the documentary on the gang-rape Hong Kong porno star, shot
in the first person? I think we had a discussion about this movie a few years
ago, both of us admiring it greatly.

Maybe more to come, since I have insomnia and spend the time often watching
old foreign movies.

Murat

Best film I've seen this year (with the Apu trilogy running a close 2nd)

Atarnajuat / The Fast Runner

Evil in the form of an unknown shaman divides a small community of =
nomadic Inuit. Twenty years pass. Two brothers emerge to challenge the =
evil order: Amaqjuaq, the Strong One, and Atarnajuat, The Fast Runner. =
Atarnajuat wins the hand of the lovely Atuat away from Oki, who vows to =
get even. A first-time feature film from the North-West Territories and =
from Zacharias Kunuk, this film was on the Official Selection for =
Cannes, Un Certain Regard 2001.

this was a good movie, the only part that was weird for me was that
the cue for the evil spirit's "evil" is that he said he adored little
boys. so the movie is a lot about the reassertion of heteronormative
family life.  but otherwise, i adored it.

it is tuesday. that's yesterday. but it's not yesterday. it's a week from yesterday. on a tuesday. like yesterday. but not yesterday. in a week. that's when. a week from yesterday. it's at THE READ in Williamsburg. Bedford / N. 9th. that's next tuesday. at 730 pm. Aug. 27. the 27th of August.

that's when the reading is. bring flashlights. it gets dark earlier now than it used to. that's because of the sun. but we haven't changed. not us. we stay the same. that's for sure.

we read together exactly a year ago.
we're MATVEI and we're CRAIG.
that's  YANKELEVICH & FOLTZ .

that's when our first books came out on LOUDMOUTH COLLECTIVE. craig's BBQ Killers and matvei's Writing in the Margins. that reading was at SIBERIA. remember?

this time only one of us has a new book from LOUDMOUTH COLLECTIVE. the 'coming up for air' book by craig foltz and shelton walsmith should see it's first public release that night.

but matvei will bring the new 6x6 #6 (with special wallpaper covers) and also a few extra copies of  a new poem-book, a collaboration with Anna Moschovakis, printed at UGLY DUCKLING PRESSE for the upcoming Loudmouth anthology box.

but that's next tuesday. not yesterday. the reading is in a series. craig foltz is responsible. for the series. and for this flagrant appropriation. a stylistic approppriation. of his style. for this message. from his own email. message. style.

look beyond style. bring a flashlight. and you may see the sun.

Kent--

In all of my previous years of reading manuscripts, not even a knee was
intentionally slapped, which is why I was tickled with the chance of
publishing _Add Musk Here_ by the Illinois writer, John Bradley. Since
Ohioans are humorous in person,  personal correspondance, and in their
own writing, we, as a neglected but literate people who are often picked
on for our flagrant wearing of wifebeaters, are rarely able to find any
individuals from out of state who are funny enough to meet our everyday
standards. From our preliminary research, performed with substantial
funding from our unfunny titles, we have found that in Illinois, the
converse relation is true. In fact, our inconclusive results have found
that large man made constructions, such as your time-zone line, create
this condition. And even tho our journal is known for its humor, full or
chapbook length submissions are usually stodgy and pretentious. I do not
understand why.

I am glad to hear that we have  "done two or three good" books out the
over 40 titles we have published in the last ten years. To have your
recommendation means so much to us and we expect an upward sales turn as
a direct result of your endorsement.


Be well

------------

Say David, I am really glad you are publishing John Bradley's book--
he's my good friend, but I'd still think he was the best American
prose poet working today even if he wasn't my good friend. And I
know he is very funny in his poetry, though in person he's not very
funny, really, which is one of the reasons we probably get along so
well-- three or four Saturdays out of the year, he and I sit there in
Sullivan's Bar in DeKalb, Illinois, earnestly exchanging grim
aphorisms about the state of poetry in America today. By the time
we bid adieu, we know we are better and more important human
beings than all the farmers in the bar.

But anyway, to get to my point, I'm curious about your mention at
Poetics that his is the "funniest book yet" that Pavement Saw has
published. I've seen lots of the books you do, and you've done two
or three good ones, but with the exception of some of Mark
duCharme's hard and witty work, what have you ever published that
is "funny"? Nearly everything I've seen from you folks over there in
Ohio land is absolutely humorless.

Therefore, I am happy you are finally publishing a poet deserving of
the honorific "funny." Hopefully, this will mark an upward turn for
Pavement Saw!

I'm sending this also to Poetryetc, since I want people to know
about John Bradley's funny book. And ubuweb, since those bionic
androids also seem bereft of any sense of humor.

best,

Many thanks, Maria.

I must say I don't understand Stephen Ellis' "grandly street" bit about
Baraka, either.
What of the Black Mountain and New York School -influenced early poems of
LeRoi Jones, who was as concerned with popular culture (like Frank O'Hara),
the poetic tradition, and linguistic revolution--as his white peers?  The
Jones becoming Baraka who assimilated Marx, Brecht, Heidegger, and Hegel?
The Baraka whose (in this case, in my opinion, unfortunately nationalist)
"street" credibility was hard-earned and included leaving his wife and kids=
?
How is he to be separated from Jonas and his "earnings"?

What's the problem with Jonas' work being in dialogue with that of avowedly
African descended writers?   Taint?  Or it's because he was queer that he
has nothing to do with other "others"?  Baldwin mirrors him in many ways, a=
s
does Samuel Delany, and again, even biracial skinhead would-be terrorist Le=
o
Felton, in terms of the "social milieu" you brought up, but I don't think
we're understanding the implications, problematics, contradictions and
rewards of milieu, skin privilege, ancestry and mythology, and the pressure
of all this on the creative process, in the same way.

Jonas and "racial division" seems to be once again an attempt to divorce
someone who is Black from the ontology of the Blackness, whether s/he
recognized it or not.  In fact Jonas's work does show the influence of Blac=
k
vernacular over and over again.

I was introduced to Jonas by Black poets, repeatedly, starting with my 7
years in the Dark Room Collective (Boston/Cambridge), who were introduced t=
o
him by Black poets, and so on.  So Stephen, your "many" who disregard Jonas
on some "Black content" tip are clearly very different from mine.  Mine are
the very same "many"  who were turned on by Harryette Mullen's work way
before the identifying mark of MUSE & DRUDGE made her a hot commodity on th=
e
color wheel, you know, back when she was supposedly "too white."

To push it, it's not an issue of "skin" color--since I believe Jonas was
very fair-skinned and could pass for white--but of ancestry.  Again, it's
there in Jonas' work. Like I said to Jim, he probably would have turned ove=
r
in his grave, just as Elizabeth Bishop might, given how resistant she was
against appearing in feminist or women's anthologies--let alone lesbian
anthologies. =20

A friend of mine seems to recall that John Ashbery also was against this
once, though he has finally come around.  75 years loving men
should finally convince a person that the label is not toxic, it's others'
reactions to it that are.

We asked each other:  Are we to say that Pushkin, Alexandre Dumas pere et
fils, Machado de Assis, William Stanley Brathwaite, and Frank Yerby, to nam=
e
a few, were NOT Black because they treated other themes in their work?  Wha=
t
about Carl Phillips and Claudia Rankine?  Will Alexander?
Are Mary Renault and Marguerite Yourcenar not lesbians because they only
wrote about homosexual men?

What I think is really interesting that so many people could so quickly
chime in and earn cool points with their one or five suggestions to help
flesh out Kathy Lou short list, but so few could have this conversation.
How is this work being read, taught, discussed?  Independent of the living
bodies, intricate root systems, timeless intellect and ever-present spirit
that went into it?

This madness is exactly how the complexity of our existence and our writing
gets compressed into nothingness, or, at best, ad-seg anthologies.
=20
Stephen, I agree that these racial categories are empty and problematic, bu=
t
as Adrian Piper said, they're all we have, and we have to work with and
through them until we can get rid of them altogether, making questions of
where people "belong" disappear.  Time and time again we're shown that the
time is not now because we're really not doing that work, just countless
work-arounds, the main one being silence (or here in the nethernay,
backchanneling). =20

I like to think good writing is fetishized and compassionate terrorism.

Cool points? That seems sort of silly to me, Tisa. Someone asks for
suggestions, and people offer the suggestions. The complexities themselves
are enormous and delicious. Rather than look at Jonas, we can look at a
whole weave of history. When I start to discuss this issues, I usually go
to Jay Wright.

In a 1983 Callaloo interview he said, "My reading of history impels me to
think that music, speech and calculation (the measuring of time and event)
have been the complex of relationships in which human spirit, action,
social and political relationships have been most gloriously exemplified. I
realize that asserting this makes literary phenomena seem primary. You
would expect a poet to insist upon literature's central position in human
affairs. We hardly apologize for this insistence any longer. But I should
stop here to say that I include in the speech community all those
practitioners of verbal art who are not normally included: the griot, the
old Testament prophet, the ritual chanter, the fabulist, the legist, the
chronicler, the preacher, even the mathematician, among others. Quite a
list, you say. What's left out? Why, nothing. Not even poetry. Among the
various speech communities, poetry finds its voice, and its unique
functions, which, nevertheless, are like those of other disciplines--the
discovery, explication, interpretation, exploration and transformation of
experience. "

I think this succinctly addresses all the questions that you raise in your
post.

Jay goes on to say, "Poetry is a concentrated, polysemous, literary act
which undertakes the discovery, explication, interpretation, exploration
and transformation of experience. It differs from some other forms of
speech in that it handles its 'facts' with more disdain, if I might put it
that way, insisting upon spiritual resonance. It differs from some other
forms of speech (such as that used by the preacher, the ritual chanter, and
the fabulist) in that it handles its spiritual domain with slightly more
critical detachment than they do. The paradox of the extreme manipulative
consciousness of the two domainsspiritual and materialindeed, their
association to produce what is at least a third and unique domainis what
distinguishes poetry from other forms of speech."
It's unfortunate that Jay won't really do many more interviews nor are
there many to read other than this one and the essay he wrote for Callaloo
in 1986, "Desire's Design, Vision's Resonance: Black Poetry's Ritual and
Historical Voice." Wright believed that "multicultural" is the way of human
development. But what of it? Some people try and pigeon hole others; some
people try to free others. Same old, same old. Should we expect anything
different on good old Buff Po?

>This madness is exactly how the complexity of our existence and our writing
>gets compressed into nothingness, or, at best, ad-seg anthologies.

The flip side to this whole madness deals with commodification. Getting
certain things into certain curricula. For instance, Toni Morrison was
first introduced into Afro-Am curricula before she was taught in "ENGLISH".
It's unfortunate shell game, but it's one that is played. And, it's played
on both side. And, everyone is played. The unfortunate situation is that
those who have certain resources make more money off the game while others
who think they're making out get simultaneously made and taken. This brings
us right back to the compressed nothingness, but it's not nothing.
Someone's making $$. --Ak

Dear List--Just recieved a strange message from Priceton edu about a virus
that does not exist on my computer (just checked it with the latest
down-loads) ; neither have I sent any messages to nick piombo, (nick's
e-mail  address does not exist in my computer's address book), yet a strange
message about nick's e-mail address change appeared in my in-box.

The Princeton message suggests that my e-address has been
"harvested"--apparently by someone who wishes to infect nick's computer.

If this has happened to my address, it must be happening to others on the
list.  Please beware.  Jesse

Gary, pardon me for hitchin' s ride herre, but  was speaking with Susan
Gevirtz today and she and I agreed it would be sufficient, amply so, if you
would send John Tranter the quote re my verse which you sent to SPD for
their catalog....a quote which indicates more clearly than anyone else has
done, the chief difference of my poetry. And thank you for that. Mr Tranter
has just abt all else in his hands at this point.
   Sorry btw if I hadn't responded further to yr invitation and offer of
$200 to read in yr series this november; my health problems wont allow it;
maybe next spring or fall? Or 2004? Meanwhile, do send me yr street address
and I'll send you my new book, due any week now. Warm Regards, David B

"meaning is what an explanation of meaning explains"
Ludwig Wittgenstein

Enigma n^2 is an audio/visual work of sound/code poetry and interactive/generative music at
http://vispo.com/animisms/enigman2 . Turn the volume up loud. Click around in it or let it be
strange on its own.

It's a new thing related to an interactive visual poem I did in 98 called Enigma n at
http://vispo.com/animisms/enigman/meaning.html .

The basic "material" of both of them is the word "meaning" and poem-sized coding. Enigma n^2
requires Shockwave and speakers. Enigma n requires a version 4+ browser. Enigma n is a
philosophical poetry toy for poets and philosophers from the age of 4 up. Enigma n^2 is a little
vismu machine with its guts hanging out on the 'page'. Both of them attempt to discover some of
the poetical possibilities that programming opens up.

DEATH TO ALL RANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS, FOREIGN & DOMESTIC!!!

Not to implicate anybody in particular, but I find that texts and other
forms of art generated by random algorithms all tend to have a superficial
complexity that fails to offer any further depths upon reappraisal. It is
like discovering faces in a passing cloud, as it mainly depends on one's
level of receptivity to the task of hallucinatorily processing some big
miasmic blob of information that one more or less believes on faith should
be parse-able into meaningful units of some kind.

I know about cut-ups and Cage and stochastics and all that, but I remain
unconvinced that randomness has much to teach us beyond the nature of our
own phantasmagoricamania. Would anybody care to come to its defense in some
interesting new way?

I agree to a point but as you probably know when "randomness " is referred
to it means "psuedo randomness": I was interested in using a collaging
method for a work I attempted and I discovered that somehow,whatever I did,
a "pattern"  or "a "rythm of meaningfulness"" emerged (because my mind was
in fact "choosing"despite...): then I considered experimenting with total
randomness (this is still what is called the pseudo random (nothing is
totally random that human's can generate - or at least if such a sysytems is
possible it is truly totally meaningless. But with the text or "poem" I
generated form various texts it was interesting to see what emerged but then
I came to a kind of lacuna: like yourself I found it all a bit futile ..
then I became interested in the way the mind works in the making or creative
process and I think that it must utilise something equivalent to a random
number generator, and the idea of working form the unknown to the known,
that is via process unending....but I_ can_ see one interest in so called
"randomness" especially vis a vis Cage and that is the way infact it in many
ways _enhances _ reality: of course the approach from art to reality and so
on is/has always been problematic. This is different from
"meaninglessness". Pound's Cantos are relatively structured but in the
process of their writing new things were introduced: Zukofsky's "A" I think
was pretty closely structured as so I believe was Ulysses ( but I read
somewhere that Joyce "sprinkled" a whole ot of words from various langauges
into the complex that became Finnegan's Wake (which yet was a highly
pre-planned even preordained and complex work which I've never read!..).
I've read some computer generated poems by Finch and they are interesting
and good that he did them, tried a new thing, but ultimately rather
meaningless: what I find and know is that the trace of the human is
essential in any work: and a poem or text without some raison d'etre,
without emotion, however strange it may seem the "emotion" or reason may
underpin, or be the source of the energy in the work: there will be very few
truly random works. Ashbery's poetry's often seems - I emphasise the
"seems" - "random" but I think he writes in a way that his mind works
"intuitively" but the ideas generated are kind of "gated through the grid of
his intelligence and memory: whereas the grid of some of the language poets
is partly the structure they impose (as  well they also have this "grid" of
the intellct and memory I think) and either the  inherent meaning (sometimes
fragmented etc) or in fact the structure points to WHAT is being said...some
of this applies of courseto "modernist" poetry:maybe all poetry of all
kinds.
     I think Alan Sondheim's work could be an example of the reverse: highly
structured and with a definite modus operandi but as (we mostly see it) it
appears  'random'.....for me a lot of poetry of course works both on the
level of a kind of musical and  - dare I say it - inefable and strange near
meaningless meaning (which is really its meaningfulness!) as it does
approach the condition of music: it needs to succesfully (almost) resist
meaningful interpretation: even some of Auden's poetry which by synbolism or
metaphor means A can mean B to another reader as he frequently uses words in
such original ways: another poet eg Geoffrey Hill has been "explicated" by
Harold Bloom and one admires his attempt and there's a critic (forget his
name  - Hart I think)) whosse book on Hill is excellent but one wonders if
its worth being quite so alert to these complex of meanings: the plot
thickens with (sorry forget the poet who wrote "Changing Light at
Sandhover") ..... I read an analysis of his poem bsaed on the Cupid and
Psyche legend and I'm afraid it was beyond me still even with analysis: but
a very beautiful poem whatever it means and its meaning is in the poetry of
its poetry: the magic: it always is in there in all good or great
poetry...but I can apreciate the beauty of these poets and derive 'meaning'
wihout being able to parse or analyse to deeply what they are "saying" (of
course one always attempts that)....I know an editor who calls all poetry
that is not I suppose "normative" - including eg Bernstein's poetry
"semiotic": but very little poetry is semiotic entirely although semiotic
concepts may influence a poet/writer and in a sense there is always
semiosis.
  But if somthing was either entirely predictable (entropy zero - and zero
information content , as in eg telecommuciations theory) or totally random
(entropy approching infinity I suppose - maximum information content)  But
the trouble is that the  totally random system - with its maximum of
potential 'news' is useless to us: we would need to be God to "understand
it" we're into Borges territory....this is bit of information theory I
remmember and may be completely wrong on it.  Reality, whatever that is,
kicks in: or practicality.
  We can theorise all we like about randomness but somehow we have to be
communicating (however complexly or seemingly disjunctively) some
'meaningfulness: some human kick, some ethic, some life, some love.  Richard
Taylor

There are two common misconceptions in your post here:
1) RANDOMNESS: The computer cannot generate a random number. There's ALWAYS a pattern, whenever Math.random( )--the JavaScript function--is evoked. These numbers are pseudo-random: they look random, but are actually patterned in some way by the machine. I say "some way" because it's not clear to me yet just what pattern the machine uses...but I was assured in Programming 101 that randomness in algorithms is a fallacy.
2) MEANINGLESSNESS: No such thing. There is absolutely no way for human beings to escape meaning. We're little meaning-generating algorithms. What appears at first to be meaningless is simply meaning we're not receptive to yet.

To delve deeper into your objections (which are valid, I believe, despite the misconceptions):
"I find that texts and other
forms of art generated by random algorithms all tend to have a superficial
complexity that fails to offer any further depths upon reappraisal."
If the motion in poetry has steadily been from the depth to the surface, what's wrong with surface complexity? And how differentiate between the surface and the depth in language in the first place?
I think it all depends on what you seek from the poem. If the poem serves to further an ego (the author's or the reader's), then text generation algorithms are not for you. In fact, it's just this egolessness that you may be finding empty in poetry produced by machines.
" I know about cut-ups and Cage and stochastics and all that, but I remain
unconvinced that randomness has much to teach us beyond the nature of our
own phantasmagoricamania"
---or about the thisness of the poem, perhaps? If one sees the poem as a phenonmenon, similar to a sunset or a tree, and doesn't seek reification of ego-concerns in the work, then these texts can prove to be bursting with meaning...in fact, your "surface complexity" is probably nothing more than the anarchy of meaning produced in such works.
Of course, there remains the question of critical standards....

I didn't realize that it was Murat's post that inspired my quotations of
Whitman until I reread his post this morning. I guess my unconscious point
was not that a Whitman poem can be expanded upon, but that we could and
should actually try to live up to some of the ideals that he proposed. Of
course I was struck in particular (I had never read this introduction to his
own work by Whitman before) by his suggestion that poets themselves should
be their own "common referee." This is precisely what I have been
envisioning as "progress" (hate that word; I prefer "development" as it is
more local as to to time periods; regression is also an unavoidable aspect
of development) for poetics. Our discussion of self-publishing is crucial to
this issue. One more note on progress in poetry. In one of my essays of
perhaps 20 years ago I wrote something like: "There is no linear development
in poetry, only a process of eroding and building."

I'm troubled to find out that Tom Beckett, who has contributed so much to
contemporary poetics (his collections in his magazine "The Difficulties" of
articles on Charles Bernstein, Susan Howe, Ron Silliman, David Bromige and
others were essential moments, to my way of thinking, in contemporary
poetics,) has never had a major collection published. If this were the only
important issue to be brought out by this thread on self-publishing I feel
the thread would have been of great value. Hopefully, getting this fact out
about Tom's work is a step towards changing this situation.

(Murat)

What I was trying to get at here was an attempt to show that the way we
understand and interpret what poems are as objects will determine how we
distribute them. I liked what Tom Beckett said about the "tangle" of poetry
that brings us back to a poem again and again.  I was trying to point out
that we can understand the communicative value of poetry without classifying
the poem object only as a collectible consumer item. By classifying poem
objects this way, we limit their distribution by grouping them with art
rarities. This is of great value to people who make art for money. We will
never make much money out of our poems, lets face it. There are only just so
many of us interested in contemporary poetry. If we utilized not the values
of scientists or even their methods, but looked at our products as
discoveries which urgently need to be shared with other investigative
explorers in the field of poetry, then we might not have the situation where
someone like Tom Beckett has not been adequately heard. This situation is
holding us back as a field and it is holding many of us back, I believe, as
individual poets. The "aura" of fragments idea relates to the notion of
found objects. The widespread use of found material in poetry is indicative,
I have a hunch, of a powerful undercurrent among poets towards cooperative
sharing and a fundamentally more democratic approach. The found item, as
Chris Cheek has pointed out,is an item transformed from the worthless to the
useful; it is universally available, part of an environment we share and are
hopefully learning to value and to refrain from damaging and destroying. The
notion of a found object, as a transitional object,  functions as an
intermediate area within which and by which we can connect with each other
without encroaching on each other or intruding on each other.

(Murat)

I don't think I want to advocate a scientific approach to poetry. But I do
think that the Harold Bloom "Anxiety of Influence" idea, that each hero poet
of each successive period has to "conquer" the oedipal hero of the previous
period points to a severe shortcoming in the way we poets understand our
positions and identities. The hierarchical aspect (that clearly Whitman
takes issue with, as may be seen in his introduction to -Leaves of
Grass-parts of which I posted yesterday) is seriously detrimental to the
self-esteem of poets. I believe that most contemporary poets suffer from
(largely unnecessary) detrimental experiences in self-esteem, anywhere from
minor to severe, a situation that can only be changed by moving forward as a
field, developing as a field, away from hierarchical models based on such
things as practices of identification and hero worship, and towards a more
equable approach, mutually supportive approach, as envisioned by Whitman
(obviously not because Whitman recommended it, but because it makes sense).
Isn't one of the main points of -Leaves of Grass- that poets have something
to be very  proud of, but that this pride should be a shared experience
based on equality?

The cut-up technique is an excellent example of technical advances in the
field of poetry. I agree that to benefit the field as a whole, it has to be
employed in an original way. But to benefit a particular poem it does not.
There is no point in having a standard in this field that every poem has to
be an original contribution to the field. But it is important for the field
to separate technical advances from the activity of hero worship. We could
talk about "The Burroughs" cup-up technique as a technical advance for
poetry. This gives a sense of tribute, and history, without hero worship,
hopefully. I think we could dispose of a lot of social and psychological
difficulties encouraged by our field if we could learn to understand that we
are working together as a field, just as in any other discipline, science or
anything, and try to jettison some of the outdated baggage that keeps
connecting us to the aristocracies and priestly hierarchies of bygone ages.
Of course every field, including science, suffers from competitive attitudes
and propriety attitudes that are destructive.



As so often before, Murat, you have galvanized my thinking; thanks for your
attention and response.

Nick

Hi M.....  a few remarks from someone not familiar
with much theory:

-when you write "forms of art generated by" you are
referring to the *process* by which a work of art is
(allegedly) generated. If you can agree that a work of
art exists only in its perception, i.e. between the
audience/reader/listener and the work of art, the way
it has been generated shouldn't matter much because
'meaning' ultimately emerges in perception.

- However, I recall some instances where the *process*
is intrinsic for its perception, where the process  is
part of the art work: in works by Beuys, for
example..... or other conceptual artists.... where we
have to know about the process (or even watch it) to
gain  further insight regarding the work of art.

- with poetry part of the issue seems to be that words
seem to have acquired 'an objective meaning of their
own' (we have to rely on this some some extent to be
able to communicate) .... as opposed to, e.g., colors
which don't (but then  think of traffic lights ...).
Why do we expect a poem to mean anyhting in a
straightforward sense .... but don't expect it from a
painting?
(I'm dimly aware of Saussure etc.... but am only
slowly coming to relate his findings to my own
practice of poetry)

- sometimes, as for instance with Finch's
computer-generated poems (which are often generated by
repeatedly using a translation program on a text), I
find I'm intrigued by the process: how interesting to
see what translation programs do ... and there are
specks of meaning in the end result. Of course, a
translation program is not random. How can the result
be? is it meaningless?
in this case, the process is intriguing and
interesting. Perhaps also because the author has given
away some authority ... thus granting it to us, the
readers? or to the machine?

Hope this is of some interest ....

Saturday July 27

These write-ups have been spaced out at odd intervals, I started writing
them when we were behind by four tubs of mail and things are about the
same after weeks of work and going to Cleveland, Dayton and Cincinnati
(sincity was the worst featured reading I can ever remember) in the
interim. I've had the disfortune to place myself in an awkward position
where the largest evaluation is saved for last. In the Main Library at
The Ohio State University, specifically room 122, we met in the morning.
Our tribe was the first to arrive and after telling some worthy
librarian jokes to librarians, they thot us harmless enough to enter and
while I set up titles to sell, plenty of pastries and cups coffee were
brought in to the conference room. Without exception, a fine pastry is a
mark of a worthy conference & the chocolate glazed donuts were
especially avant guard.

The first person I saw was mIEKAL aND who was reading material straight
from various web projects he has done. Starting with mezocrostics for
Dick Higgins, after a few minutes, when I realized that a reading from
web pages I was familiar with would be his entire performance, I went
upstairs to hear the competition, which sounded interesting, a paper on
Burroughs, at the library with the largest collection of his work. This
presentation was horrible, there was one primary source, which was
Kostelanetz, and I couldn't decide if he was used because the presenter
was hoping to impress him, or because having five books by the same
author was an easy way to research. I was embarrassed that our wonderful
collection was so under- & mis- represented for the weekend by this
drollery. Especially considering the distance I had traveled between the
two reading spaces, located excruciatingly far from each other, if one
were interested in trying to flit about as I do.

I was unable to tolerate remaining in that same room long enough to hear
a part of William J. Austin's talk, I ran downstairs to hear Ficus
Strangulensis, who had a visual poetry presentation using the overhead
projector. Ficus often moved too fast with his showings, things cranked
by with brief explanation & often before they could be fully
appreciated; but what a show! A brilliant moment in the middle was when
he was doing these poem transformations through handwriting which I had
seen many of, where one word at the top of the page, such as 'poem' is
changed into another, say 'hand' at the bottom of the page, visually
through a gradual downward asemic method. Ficus' threw a wrench in, by
breaking the rule of slight visual letter changes & placing an object in
the center. I could see doing this myself in a fit of laziness, "damn,
this 'a' just doesn't look anything like a 'z.' Screw it, lets draw a
circle in the center."  While this needs to be seen for full
appreciation I hope this description is clear enough for now. I was able
to ask some questions regarding where he got his type from, how,  and
what method he used to catalog such a large amount (by folder & type
size) & other things & I think people were tired of me asking questions
(tho when he was talking about the meaning of whiteness on the page, I
got in a good joke between slides, as the blank screen projected, "oh,
is that what you mean." Unlike other conferences, say when all the
grammarians meet at the MLA or the "creative writers" at AWP, the jokes
were not necessary to keep me interested.

At 10:00 AM Igor Satanovsky did not appear, so Carlos Luis read. This
displacement pissed a bunch of people off since they missed Carlos as a
direct result. I found Luis' use of the computer interesting, even wild
in this time period, he creates visual poems on the computer, but only
as an method of production. Once the 'poem' is finished he prints one
copy then permanently deletes it off the hard drive. I was glad to catch
his work also, it sounded wonderful, tho I didn't understand it since I
do not speak spanish or cuban. Having been raised by a tribe of poets
who could make boxes of macaroni sound good, I felt right at home at the
reading. I had another, albeit different,  pastry which was not nearly
at the forefront of muffinry as the aforesaid donut.

Igor read & while his short readings (see Friday & Sunday reports) were
excellent, this one was tedious because the thought placed behind using
the bullhorn on Friday shifted from fitting the work to being
arbitrarily used as the tool of the man. I was disappointed. The lack of
connection was grating, and as the yelling continued, I slipped out and
went to see Irving Weiss read his translation of Malcolm de Chazal's
Sens-Plastique. I am sure glad I did. Unfamiliar with the original, all
was consistently attention grabbing with moments that were amazing & a
full three minute period where I was lilted & lifted out of the room.
One of the highest points of the conference, the area was a description
of the face in other terms, I wish I had my notebook with me. Irving, if
you could fill me in on when the translation is coming out, & the
publisher, I would greatly appreciate it.

I went downstairs to see Scott Helmes' presentation and stopped by the
book area before the show started. I bought a handmade edition of a Jim
Leftwich book and a gorgeous four color "folio" by Kathy (KS) Ernst
called Plaisir D'Amour. The night before, in trade from mieKAL, I
acquired Sequencing, a card deck that kept me up an extra hour that
night with its visual, electronic circuit looking vizpoems. Also, I was
eyeing a silkscreened vispoem by Marilyn Rosenberg which was wonderful,
probably three foot by four, but, while a steal at $99, was beyond my
financial means. Over the day the most popular sellers seemed to be a
vispo anthology edited by Scott Helmes (co-edited by Grumman?) , which
disappeared before I could get a copy (or record the title), Plaisir
D'Amour by Ernst, Falling in Love Falling in Love with you Syntax by
Sheila Murphy.

Helmes presentation was a two screened slide show with him discussing
various point about the works on the screen. Unlike the other vispo
folks at the show, with the exception of Ernst, Helmes mostly does works
which are serial in nature. Having been first exposed to his work thru a
Zelot/Tansy chapbook from the late 80's, it was nice to see so much
together at once and at a followable pacing due to the two screen
set-up. The fragments of letters pieces I've always liked, where a
template is used to create a new visual reminiscent of a word, that
seems to contain a message, but never quite acquiesces to the page
enough to be understood. These visual remnants of meaning are appealing
to me. He showed a large and intense swatch of his work and afterward I
could form a single question.

With a chant of "follow me, I'm misleading!"  many walked behind us
hoping for lunch, confused from four hours of readings & lectures only
to find themselves five minutes later, on high street, abandoned.

Thanks, Anastasios.

Cool points: I'll admit that comment was coming out of frustration with the
more game-show aspect of this process of research, in spite of the beauty of
community evidenced here at such times.  Surely a quick and effective way to
harvest, to cull, and learn, and I often contribute if I can, but then never
initiate request, as something not silly nags.   Some natural tension
between progress and process, perhaps, struggle necessarily yielding to
ease, legendary/lifelong back break vs. the illusion of fingersnap.   Maybe
I'm just getting old, or my politics need a shift.  My apologies to the
list; I'll figure this out on my own time.  Life is work.  Work is work.

I appreciate your offering Jay Wright's words and work as a touchstone for
understanding.  That was a lengthy quote; you must keep him close at hand.
These times demand we be quick.  I've just moved; my set of Callaloo is with
everything else, in boxes.

In these discussions, I can't say that I start with any one person's work,
save for the line that indoctrinated me into literary life, Clarence Major's
"Total Life Is What We Want."  To look at the weave of history, well, is
there any other way?   We're fortunate so many have done so much.  Ntozake,
Henry Louis Gates, Wahneema Lubiano, Zora Neale Hurston, Gayl Jones with her
treatise on the Third World Novel experiment, more and on and on around the
world.

Wright's thinking does indeed address much of what I've questioned, much of
what I've long believed, addresses the bulk of my own non-traditional
("grandly street") literary education, and more and more still, for years of
learning to come.

I admire the way Wright makes simple the third domain, poetry, as coming
from the domains of the spiritual and material, so then including all artful
speech and speakers, without supplanting written traditions for oral, as
some other folks do, but calling, like Cecil Taylor or Ed Roberson, to Eshu,
to blend and guide voices over and through.   We must be able to call on
something, someone, surely, for confirmation and synthesis, before we can
move on.

My mentioning Harryette Mullen was a way of addressing the both sides of the
full madness: Toni Morrison not being taught in English curriculums for
years; Harryette Mullen being fully ignored in Afro-Am departments until
recently.  Or any number of other examples, or all of Wanda Coleman's
response to being shut out of Black lit functions for critiquing Maya
Angelou, where she chronicles the struggle for a living Black literature,
the payoff, the payback, the playbook.

To pigeon hole, to free...

Thanks again.

I confess. I have been working on a sort of long term project in my private
time on Jay's work, and I typed these quotes up earlier in the spring. But,
I'm glad they were handy last night! Wright's DIMENSIONS OF HISTORY is an
excellent place to look at all these issues in play.

best.

<P>Tisa, I like it that you forward ancestry over appearances.&nbsp; How do you propose to work through the toxicity of label; given that name recognition is increasingly commodity fetish?&nbsp; Are categories really "the only thing we have to work with" in this?&nbsp; Anyway,</P></DIV>
<P>I made the mistake of presuming in Jonas' stead that he might prefer not to be discussed as a practitioner within a group he had certain difficulties identifying with.&nbsp; The work he left behind are obviously rife with associations other than those persons he while alive claimed as&nbsp;influence.&nbsp; Sure, his work is full of The Tradition, and his presence as subject in a conference on same would propably strengthen - and open out&nbsp;- that tradition considerably.</P>
<DIV></DIV>
<P>In the end, all combination is taint, individual to individual - even in likeness, it's between&nbsp;"you" and "not you".&nbsp; But if one's attempting to consolidate a category, these are the first differences to be deflected.&nbsp; Hopefully, a deflection that's temporary, tho since goal in that arena of&nbsp;"setting aside difference"&nbsp;would be to nail conditional similiarities down to&nbsp;category, generic likenesses tend to overshadow individual eccentricities to an unusually high degree.&nbsp; Hopefully</P>
<DIV></DIV>
<P>the work you mention - Jonas' too - is being read and taught without applying it toward canonical staus -&nbsp;whatever that may be - but given the habit of history, there seems real reason to doubt.&nbsp; More like walkarounds than workarounds - but what would the real work be?&nbsp; In the public world, poets (and poetry), like show dogs, have a tendency to seem perhaps a little too fey in style&nbsp;to really "show" <EM>anything</EM>.&nbsp; I suppose</P>
<DIV></DIV>
<P>I'm not addressing the substance of your post, depressing as issues of separation, categorization and/or canonization seem; the ideals of lawful identification and use of anything seem nothing if not slightly ridiculous.&nbsp; One does, tho, have to start somewhere, behaving as if one were something other than underfoot of&nbsp;your standard American provincial mute.<BR><BR></P>

<DIV></DIV>&gt;Many thanks, Maria.
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I must say I don't understand Stephen Ellis' "grandly street" bit
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;about
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Baraka, either.
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;What of the Black Mountain and New York School -influenced early
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;poems of
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;LeRoi Jones, who was as concerned with popular culture (like Frank
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;O'Hara),
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the poetic tradition, and linguistic revolution--as his white peers?
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt; The
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Jones becoming Baraka who assimilated Marx, Brecht, Heidegger, and
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Hegel?
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;The Baraka whose (in this case, in my opinion, unfortunately
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;nationalist)
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;"street" credibility was hard-earned and included leaving his wife
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;and kids?
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;How is he to be separated from Jonas and his "earnings"?
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;What's the problem with Jonas' work being in dialogue with that of
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;avowedly
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;African descended writers? Taint? Or it's because he was queer
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;that he
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;has nothing to do with other "others"? Baldwin mirrors him in many
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;ways, as
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;does Samuel Delany, and again, even biracial skinhead would-be
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;terrorist Leo
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Felton, in terms of the "social milieu" you brought up, but I don't
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;think
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;we're understanding the implications, problematics, contradictions
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;and
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;rewards of milieu, skin privilege, ancestry and mythology, and the
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;pressure
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;of all this on the creative process, in the same way.
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Jonas and "racial division" seems to be once again an attempt to
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;divorce
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;someone who is Black from the ontology of the Blackness, whether
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;s/he
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;recognized it or not. In fact Jonas's work does show the influence
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;of Black
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;vernacular over and over again.
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I was introduced to Jonas by Black poets, repeatedly, starting with
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;my 7
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;years in the Dark Room Collective (Boston/Cambridge), who were
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;introduced to
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;him by Black poets, and so on. So Stephen, your "many" who
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;disregard Jonas
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;on some "Black content" tip are clearly very different from mine.
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Mine are
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the very same "many" who were turned on by Harryette Mullen's work
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;way
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;before the identifying mark of MUSE &amp; DRUDGE made her a hot
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;commodity on the
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;color wheel, you know, back when she was supposedly "too white."
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;To push it, it's not an issue of "skin" color--since I believe Jonas
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;was
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;very fair-skinned and could pass for white--but of ancestry. Again,
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;it's
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;there in Jonas' work. Like I said to Jim, he probably would have
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;turned over
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;in his grave, just as Elizabeth Bishop might, given how resistant
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;she was
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;against appearing in feminist or women's anthologies--let alone
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;lesbian
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;anthologies.
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;A friend of mine seems to recall that John Ashbery also was against
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;this
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;once, though he has finally come around. 75 years loving men
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;should finally convince a person that the label is not toxic, it's
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;others'
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;reactions to it that are.
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;We asked each other: Are we to say that Pushkin, Alexandre Dumas
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;pere et
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;fils, Machado de Assis, William Stanley Brathwaite, and Frank Yerby,
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to name
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;a few, were NOT Black because they treated other themes in their
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;work? What
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;about Carl Phillips and Claudia Rankine? Will Alexander?
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Are Mary Renault and Marguerite Yourcenar not lesbians because they
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;only
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;wrote about homosexual men?
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;What I think is really interesting that so many people could so
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;quickly
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;chime in and earn cool points with their one or five suggestions to
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;help
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;flesh out Kathy Lou short list, but so few could have this
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;conversation.
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;How is this work being read, taught, discussed? Independent of the
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;living
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;bodies, intricate root systems, timeless intellect and ever-present
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;spirit
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;that went into it?
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;This madness is exactly how the complexity of our existence and our
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;writing
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;gets compressed into nothingness, or, at best, ad-seg anthologies.
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Stephen, I agree that these racial categories are empty and
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;problematic, but
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;as Adrian Piper said, they're all we have, and we have to work with
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;and
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;through them until we can get rid of them altogether, making
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;questions of
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;where people "belong" disappear. Time and time again we're shown
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;that the
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;time is not now because we're really not doing that work, just
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;countless
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;work-arounds, the main one being silence (or here in the nethernay,
<DIV></DIV>

<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; Being gay, also, sets up categorical distinctions within "black

<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;for
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; equity in all senses of commerce place him at the very
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;beginnings of
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; lawful creation, rather than in a generalized social mileu. His
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; work is as particular in aspect as Hammurabi's code - and as
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; essential. To categorize him by the patina of his skin suggests
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; parity with an Egyptian sophistication out of Beirut in the 30s,
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;or
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt; better, Muslim Spain of the 12th century, where Qabbalistic
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;study

this isn't particularly new, but i can think of no better apology for the use
of randomness, or chance based procedures (and i'm just going to conflate them
here, willy nilly, with no care for precision or real or pseudo-randomness,
cause what we're really talking about is the deliberate disavowal of authorial
control over the production of the text, by any means, yes? pretty sure it
comes down to control in the end. and it's august, and i just don't feel like
being rigorous.) than joan retallack's SECNÀHC GNIKÀT : TAKING CHANCES.
The full text can be found here:
http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/retallack/taking-chances.html

some choice snippets follow:



I, along with everyone else, work at the intersection of chance and intention.
The selective use of chance procedures merely foregrounds what is at work in
all that we do and experience, whether or not we wish to turn our attention to
it. The results of "chance operations," as Cage liked to call them, are just
that, nothing more, nothing less than a turning of attention toward the
silences that lie beyond the habits, desires, fears of our intentionally
directed eyes and ears. What results from the use of chance procedures may
shock or delight. The light in delight is that of the sheer given. Nature's
processes operating independently of our opinions about them. The stars before
we herd them into constellations. Ah, but don't worry, one needn't forego the
pleasures of constellations to invite chance into the conversation.

The selective foregrounding of chance makes it possible to bring to light and
sound things that are otherwise potently absent or ominous. Perhaps because
we've tended to be uncomfortable with things outside what we take to be the
realm of control, we miss/ignore/deny the circumstantial evidence that chance
is all around us. Hence the silences--feminine, phobic, phallic--wherein lie
unmined energies of chance. Is it primarily fear (biological conservatism) that
has so firmly tied our attention to simple periodicities and regularities, that
has led us hear harmony only in simple color-coordinated chords? Probably,
improbably enough. (It is after all the characteristically chaotic rhythms of
the normal brain that neurophysiologists credit with all our abilities for
complex innovative thought and action.) But it's our ability to operate outside
regularities, that takes us toward the discoveries and enactments of
imagination, the play and invention that we like to identify as the
characteristically human contribution to the fractal intricacies of our
universe. Every now and then an artist gives us the breath-filled resonances of
more complex chords.

</choice snippet>


and i was just looking over some of my students' own writings on their own
poetic processes, and i found a couple of interesting statements. 17 year olds
are pretty focussed on meaning and intentionality, as a rule, but some of them
really groove on random procedures in composition. like this fellow here:

".. Other than that, the words chosen were completely random. I liked that idea
because my life often seems random and chaotic, and every now and then some
sense of order and meaning presents itself. I felt that forming some meaning
and order to almost compltely random word selections would possibly help me
gather insight into life itself. Or, if you entertain a more mathematical
mindset, there is no such thing as complete randomness, only infinitely complex
systems, or algorithms. Since poetry to me either seeks meaning or randomness,
I felt that a fairly random selection of words was legitimate."

Thanks to everybody who took the blow of my opening salvo! I will
collectivize my responses to the various comments and present them here en
masse.

First let me beg to leave the issue of Meaning vs. Meaninglessness aside, as
I don't know if I can get into it without embarking on a marathon debate.

I am quite familiar with how random generators work and what limitations
they have with regard to the modeling of true random events. The fact is,
though, that randomness doesn't have to be entirely "pure" for a process to
be perceived as sufficiently random for one's purposes. (Just look at Las
Vegas!) As long as the statistical spectrum of a random algorithmic process
shows it to be random within its intended context, then for all intents and
purposes, de facto, if not de jure, it is.

"Depth" is the way a good work of art gets richer upon repeated readings or
viewings. That is, by delving more deeply into its structure we come to
grasp the internal connections more acutely and more integratedly. In a
poem, for instance, this might involve seeing how the musicality of the
words interact with their meanings. Such a thing cannot happen in a work of
random-generated pseudo-complexity because it has no depths or integrations
to embrace. It is all surface and no substance.

I fully agree that randomness is a fine and dandy tool for diverting an
artist from well-worn grooves. As long as randomness doesn't get taken for
what it is not, I have no problem with using it as a shock-cutting
self-discombobulator.  But, unfortunately, in part due to the widespread
rise of computer-assisted art, random number processes and their
counterparts have become practically pro forma among self-proclaimedly
"experimental" artists and composers, and even poets, if only because these
processes are so easy to program. You simply apply RND() or FRACTALIZE() to
some dull database sequence and it instantly takes on a new complexity! Wow!
My point is that this approach is the easy way out, and also a dangerous one
because it promises delights it cannot deliver upon except at the most
superficial of levels.

I am not arguing against the general use of random processes in art, but
against their facile misuse. Cage clearly understands this distinction,
which is why his work evades my critique. In a sense I would argue that
grasping the prevalence of randomness in the universe is one of the great
advances of the modern era, and today's art definitely needs to reflect
this. But I would also add the proviso that it should do so in a way that
doesn't sacrifice what art has always been about, even at its most
self-abnegating, which is to give people a rich, multifaceted experience
that deepens upon repeated exposures.

As far as life and everything else is concerned, I am perfectly at peace
philosophically with the role randomness plays in genetic evolution and
other natural forces. Just don't expect me to wait around for a work of art
that only comes into existence after a few million years of arbitrary
growth!

I actually believe that all works of art -- all -- have an integral
component of randomness that helps bring them into being. My dispute here is
only with those artists who use randomness as a crutch to make their work
seem more textured than it really is. To me this is the lesson that lies at
the heart of Mallarme's admonition that one shouldn't be misled into
believing that a mere toss of the dice -- i.e., the embrace of randomness as
such -- is enough to abolish the true quality of chance that arises as the
fundamental residue of the manifold risks artists take in the making of
their work and that people take in the shaping of their lives amidst the
ruin and entropy that is nature's law. By using randomness as a crude tool
for inflating the "complexity" of a work of art one is effectively
cheapening the real effects of randomness upon our basic ontological being,
which is that it can have deadly serious consequences. (But also great
opportunities for beauty!)

Which leads me finally to say what there is to learn in art beyond the
nature of our own solipsistic hallucinatory phantom-states of mind. We learn
what it means to be other, to explore virtual otherscapes that the mind dare
not enter on its own even in reverie. Randomness creates the illusion we
have moved someplace interesting and shocking and new, when in fact it is a
false narcissistic spinning-wheel utopia.

This thread reminds me of that famous passage in Leonardo Da Vinci's
notebooks where he speaks of his fascination with a spit stained wall, and of
the images  and beauty he saw there.  Inspiration, meaning, can be found
anywhere.  Having the eyes to recognize the images, the beauty, the patterns
is a whole nother thang.

One encouraged the posting of poems,
the other actively discouraged such posting

(except once during a morbid death watch

One encouraged discussions about poetics and other topics,
the other did not

MWP--someone I should know I guess--intrigues me with the authoritative way
in which he collectivizes his responses.  I really must agree with what he
says--especially given the postings of Alan Sondheim's happy bits to this
list.  Yes, that's exactly what is missing in most computer-generated work:
depth.

However, I would like MWP to give some examples to back up his assertions in
relation to John Cage and his ability to use random processes in a
"non-facile" manner.  Cage virtually gave up traditional composing in the
late 1950s and used random processes in his work for the remainder of his
life.  As a Cage fan, I find some of Cage's radomly-generated works
immensely interesting, and some appear to me to lack that depth that draws
me back to read it or listen to it over and over.  My question I guess is
this: how does one use a random process, or processes over 40 odd years as
an artist and remain "non-facile" in its use?  I do not believe that John
Cage would escape your critique--especially if one is familiar with his
complete body of work.

If by randomness we include fractal forms, then it appears that many artists
have used forms of randomnity as "crutches" in their work.  Of course,
there's Leonardo's famous anecdote about the stained wall, which probably
led to his invention of the sfumato technique--the smoke, or veiling of
intricate detail that graces the backgrounds of most of his paintings-- and
in Japan there's the wonderful scroll of 100 Obake (monsters or ghosts) said
to have been inspired by the fungus on a temple wall.  In addition the
technique of frottage gave Max Ernst the complexity he needed to make some
of his most interesting art, etc. etc.

I find fractal forms "deep" in the sense that when I fly above a coastline
in a jet and I peer down I see more and more connections.  I can say the
same about the complexity (fractal forms) in Durer, in Holbein, in some of
Cage's smoke paintings and in the raku that my Japanese friend fires in the
mountains of Kumamoto.

But what makes the use of random processes by some artists facile, and some
not, because it all seems to be one and the same process available to all
the arts.

Or is the difference to be found not in the arts per se, but in the use of
the computer as a generator of "art"?

Of course, it's this very lack of depth that causes a text, or a visual or
aural work to become boring, and boredom, I believe, is the great sin of
most 20th century (and now 21st c.) art.

Another aspect of this whole issue of computer poetry and art depends on a
certain mass forgetting that seems to be washing through the collective
heads of the young.  These people are encouraged to see the great writers of
the past as museum pieces and hardly relevant to today's new consciousness
in the arts.

There's a Zen saying that goes, When people are hungry and thirsty they will
eat and drink anything.  I believe this is how random, computer-generated
"depthless" texts can come to be called "poetry."

Excuse these final ramblings,

Jesse

here is a question: i'm looking for poems or songs about basketball.
hoops films?  while i know some of them, i'm always impressed by the
kinds of lists this list can generate. send a message off list if you
have any suggestions. thanks for the help.

Jesse etal. I'm in some agreement with MWP but I think we need to know how
exactly we arrive at things that have depth: certain kinds of poets are
more deliberate about what they do: they seem to plan thier entire work.
Others like Pollock seem to rely on spotaneity and certain unconscious
"powers" (although its just that the mid is working at a "deeper" level  and
the 'meaning created is emotional and expressive and so on rather than
conceptual as we know (eg conceptual art or more "deliberate" art) and then
there's eg an artist such as Rebecca Horne who although she plans, she
_says_ at  least,  that she doesnt know why she has two guns that shoot each
other (I saw that exhibit when i visited NY in 1993), and there's also the
question of prosess. Also, as someone said, meaning is everywhere: it is
inherent in the very placing of words: it's virtually impossible to escape
"meaning" ...total randomnes would be wonderfully meaningfully meaningless:
but as MWP knows and others we are normally talking about the psuedo random:
now in telecommunications we used "pseudo random noise generators" for
testing signal to noise ratios and cross over between 4 khz channels: these
are basically diodes or amplifiers that are overdriven and out comes noise:
as has been pointed out that is random enough and so are computer generated
random functions I would imagine so the issue is to what extent is it
meaning full: here we also get into the problem of meaning and the how and
what of meaning...and I think that question has confronted artists and poets
forever: the nature of reality: to what extent we are a part of that
reality, the "distance" the poet/artist adopts, the use of "magic" and so
on. What I know of Derrida is that he very aware of the problematic nature
of 'meaning' but that doesnt excommunicate the fundamental human
"meaningfulness" we all know. The question is also what is depth. Its not
totally a function of the intellection in a work: but there is almost no
writing or art of any value or kind that is meaningless or without depth
(without intelectiona and emotion etc). One way is for the author to be
foreward then bow out then return and then for a multiplex of dialogues to
inter-act ( even Thackeray in "Vanity Fair" or Brecht later and so on): I
"worked on" (or am playing with still in a rather desultory way) a thing I
called "the Infinite Poem" which began by utilising  near random collage etc
but  I found that I couldnt avoid meaning or even a kind of vestigial
narrative or trace of a narrative i found in a work that began utilising the
random selections of different texts and juxtaposing them but then I decided
that I would let this "poem" become a process (as I had read  about Beuys
and some conceptual art by then, and about such as Louise Bourgeois - who is
not a conceptual artist per se but who work from the idea of certain trauma
in her childhood and her life's devolpment and so on))and
Boltanksi and others) and as time past became also interested in Cage and
even Charles Ives: who'se father detuned pianos before Cage and I also liked
seeing examples of the many drafts of a work: I prefer seeing all those to
seeing a completed work, and initially (and still somewhat) I was attracted
to the idea of (deliberate or not) imperfectness - sloppiness even.  That
anything could come into the "work"  which became a paradigm or analogue or
whatever of life itself....but in my intial work there were things that I a
had "generated" in between the the "found" texts: the next step is/maybe
will be to allow anything and everyone into the "project" and for it to
become "self-generating" (so that "contributors are selected by ballot
rather than on "merit" and I bow out so to speak or not) ...but pardoxically
I still reserve the right to write semi-normative and "perfect" poems (if I
can ever be bothered or get passionate enough to want to ...) which may or
may ot be "subsumed" into the text or whatever it is.

Alan Sondheim's work is a large and quite structured and philosophic/poetic
project and whatever one thinks of it his poems he sends are part of that
and not random as they seem (they often seem chaotic as they come on the
list)...but there's something here (I dont mean specifically in Alan's work)
( I mean in this question of the random as the mind I think utilises some
form of random as well as "structured" scanning into its own memory) that
reflects the way the mind actually works increating eg a "logical
thought"(and in dreams we get a kind of dream illogic logic)...what is the
process that leads to the thought's thought and if we call that state say E,
the what '[multiplied by (r acting on E creates E? where r is whatever
initiates the proces leading to the formulation of E or parts of E)]  So a
thought "completed" (as we perceive it  this term is dubious) might be
represented
by a formula such as:

     completed thought = a multiplied by E or     c. t.  becomes a function
of  some function of a.E where a is the thought's thought's thought and so
on....

This is where philosophy, psychology, neurology, mathematics and other
disciplines converge on or have relevance to poetics or "poetry" or art
whatever poetry is.

But regardless of philosophy: poetry or art, if it is to be of signal value,
must have the fundamental human emotional, psychological, and ontological
concerns: however complex or random or disjunct we become. And of course
things can be rich,strange, and beautiful even if created (apparently) by
random processes: so you all have permission to be as playful or random or
deep or shallow or kitschy or planned or absorbtive or antiabsorbptive or
mysterous or confessional or simple or obscure or "good" or "bad" or tinkly
or motile or as strangley and pulsingly visual frightening calming exciting
boring devastating repetitive formal unformal insane or wonderful woody
word-centred slef-indulgent narcissistic self-sacrificing bland jittery
amazed truculent devious or childlike as  you like!

None of which adresses the question of why approximately 24000 people are
dying from the direct and indirect effects of poverty every day.(UN report
cited by John Pilger). but poetry may do nothing or not but it doesnt kill
people - asfar as I know.)

Im always fascinated by people's blanket condemnation of process.  It seems to
me what you say could be applied to literally any writing convention, cut-ups,
automatic writing, haiku, sonnets, concrete poetry, xerox art.  In many ways
they operate as a preset, & a certain percentage of creators will mark new
territory & extend the form & most will only enact a static & predictable
versioning of the preset.

well now here's an old problem for you:  i find that sondheim's work
does have "depth," and that encountering his work has been one of the
most exciting and rewarding things about being on the list. so  what
does this mean, that 2 people with some knowledge of and respect for
poetry and poetics have such different responses to the same work?
is one of us "wrong," or is the old saw true that "taste" is not
worth arguing about? which gets us back to the question of the
utility of "evaluative criticism" that was such a hot topic a couple
of months ago.

I have two poems about basketball.  I'm not sure how old you are, so
Dawkins and his Clinton-like (George, that is) may not be familiar.  Here
is a link to one on Shaq that was in canwehaveourballback?  And, below on
Dawkins.

The Legend of Lovetron

In a place

He hoisted himself

a wrecking ball

then descended
into a dunk.
Shattered backboard.

Robinzine did
The Scream,

He ran.

It was the best of lists;

Two cities
that shared a similar style,
shared a similar climate,

had somehow diverged dramatically

One's list was mainly a list,
the other's list was merely one of its many functions

One encouraged the posting of poems,
the other actively discouraged such posting

(except once during a morbid death watch

when poets posted poems about a beloved local poet)

One encouraged discussions about poetics and other topics,
the other did not

(though members were occasionally treated

to 'mistaken' mailings meant to be private,

including pathetic pleadings for a job)

Oh well,

I agree depth is missing in the work so far but the 'depth' comes from the
process and relation of artist to procedure.  I try and get to this in my
review of Loss' book here but I'm not sure how successfully I get the point
across?
Loss Pequen~o Glazier.  Digital Poetics: The Making of E-Poetries.
Tuscaloosa, The University of Alabama Press, 2002.

If you want to be an e-poet, you need this book.  If you want to know about
the development of e-poetry you should read this book.  And if you want a
poet's perspective on implements (software, systems, and code) used to make
the e-poetry that is being done on the internet today  this book will help
you think through and develop your own working philosophy or  poetics.  It
will also lead you to get on with the job at hand or, more precisely, on
your monitor.

Loss Glazier is the  Director of the Electronic Poetry Center of the State
University of New York at Buffalo http://epc.buffalo.edu/  (arguably the
premier site or home for poetry today) and so speaks with some authority.
But here he speaks as an involved poet and as the kind of teacher who gives
you sources and a working philosophy against which  you can develop your own
way of doing e-poetry.  Here are sources, tools, and some sound ideas, so go
out onto the internet and do it.

This book may present difficulties for some readers since Glazier addresses
the confluence of two contemporary cultural streams:  the potential the
internet has opened up for world experimental art and artists; and poetry as
it is increasingly practiced today.  These streams don't converge in a
simple fashion in the real world but rather interact on a number of levels.
However, Glazier has found a mechanism to center on the cutting edge of
interest in the current in both streams through use of sidebars (a mechanism
grounded in hypertext and information retrieval sources).   His sidebars
stem from "techne" which aptly enough has roots in both art and technology.
Like internet links, techne can send one back through history or out onto an
information lode.   The book is not to be read as a cover-to-cover thesis
but as a sourcebook to keep at hand should something jar and one feels a
need for exploring an information avenue: one can techne,  jump, or link
intellectually here even if not virtually via  the internet.  Not as easy as
navigating the net,  but close.

Adapting technology to art is one of the streams this book explores and it
should be emphasized that the approach is one of adapting tools to art, in
the tradition of Cayley and Rosenberg, rather than the all-too-common
approach which seeks to adapt art and poetry to the latest technology.  With
the poet in his or her appropriate place as user of an implement to create,
you are ready to begin.  Beyond a computer and an internet connection you
need some history, some internet geography and knowledge of the unique tools
available out there for you to use: codes and hypertext have proven
themselves capable of expressing more than just words on the page or in a
book.

 In this rapidly changing environment it's obvious that you will never know
all you need to know and there will always be unendable disagreements about
which code or piece of software is best, but Glazier manages to furnish a
handhold and perspective to get you started writing or e-poeting - don't
quibble over the term here, just do it.    While this is not a handbook on a
specific technology or a textbook on learning a specific computer language,
he does furnish enough basics and a glossary so that you can learn to grep
with the best.  With the basics you are adequately equipped, I feel, to use
any language or piece of technology in the process of writing poetry.  As
Ron Silliman said "Larger productions, such as poems, are like completed
machines.  Any individual sentence might be a piston.  It will not get you
down the road by itself, but you could not move the vehicle without it (from
The New Sentence as quoted by Glazier)."

This talk of vehicles might seem to hearken bark to the Futurists and their
dead-end fascination with machinery (or computers in this case) but rather
leads to the works Russian branch of Futurism and to other pieces, such as
Apollinaire's "Il Pleut" where letters come "ALIVE" as Glazier points out.
Poetry is not about machines but poetry is a machine to be used by a poet to
do wondrous things with motion for Apollinaire and Glazier, sound for Dmitry
Bulatov, computer games for Jim Andrews, holopoetry for Eduardo Kac, code
for Ted Warnell, while for me it is a process to explore the visual,
visceral, and  gestural.  This is the second stream of the book where the
emphasis is on 'art' and 'poetry' in the process or making.

This is experimental poetry as it is practiced today, in conditional space -
the as-if space where the poet uses his tools in the encounter with the
world as he or she sees it on the page, on the internet, or in the world.
While avant garde or experimental approaches to poetry have been present for
about a century (and actually go back to it's roots) it is only recently
that they have been adopted by the mainstream academy in the United States.
This 'new' poetry which, if it is new, could be called post-post modern,
language poetry, or "acadominant" as it was recently called on the POETICS
list (http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html), emphasizes the poem's
materiality; may seem disjointed to those schooled in traditional poetic
forms' and may seem 'tentative' as it does question where science,
rationality, assertiveness, etc., have landed civilization.

Attention to process is a way of dealing with the technology of computing
and the internet for Glazier here just as it can be a way for us to deal
with the technology of our world.  At the same time it is a way of moving
beyond the often crushing (of self as well as others) demands of the
subjective "I" which with its excesses has led to many of the vicissitudes
of contemporary culture.  These two statements are obviously replete with
psychological and poetic arguments and counterarguments which space here
doesn't allow, but a look at procedure begun by an 'ego' might make this
point clearer.  Procedure is a poem generated electronically through code or
by a machine or monkey and there is obviously no ego "doing" it.  But this
procedure was set in motion by a human computer, machine-operator, or animal
trainer.  One could attend to the procedure or the operator, but as Glazier
and others have shown one can also attend to the process at play between the
two and it is this "play" that is what is of interest.

In this fashion Glazier's centering on process in both these streams gives a
way for the reader to go to work by directing attention to the processes of
poetry, of navigating the internet, and of computing.  This is the step
computing and constructing and navigating the internet can take toward a
second Gutenberg revolution.  The process of e-poetry introduces the reader
to both the "electronic" and the "poetry" in electronic poetry as they are
practiced today and hopefully will be in the years to come as the electronic
world is truly (after some recent false starts) poised to overwhelm the
print world.  We are back to Glazier's starting point: Federico Garcia Lorca
's In Search of Duende,  "Behind those black sounds, tenderly and
intimately, live zephyrs, ants, volcanoes, and the huge night straining its
waist against the Milky Way."

Doesn't "depth" come also from the "process and relation"
of reader to text? Seems so in my experience, anyway.

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. If that's true,
then the person who love and hate Alan's work would represent the equal and
opposite reactions. Those with milder opinions would sit on the continuum
between the two extremes. Two equally intelligent people can justify
opposing opinions equally well. I believe it ultimately comes down to taste,
but that the differing evaluations can deepen our insight into what we think
the author is or isn't doing.

Yes, Paul Beatty definitely has poems about this, and
also his novel _White Boy Shuffle_ deals with bball,
as I recall.

One of France's biggest daily newspapers, Libération, just published a solid
piece on the demise of Black Sparrow Press in its weekly Literature
supplement. For those who can read French & want to check it out, the link
is below. Libé obviously comes to BS via the Buk, but still, this is rare --
has anyone seen a piece on BS's demise in the US national Press?

Libé often does unexpected things (at least one wouldn't expect them this
side of the Atlantic). My favorite is (yellowing now in front opf me pinned
to the wall) their issue on the day Burroughs died, which sported a front
cover filled with a photo of WSB taking aim with a winchester, with the
caption reading:WILLIAM BURROUGHS DECROCHE  which could rtanslate as
BURROUGHS KICKS THE BUCKET_

Sherman Alexie is a basketball enthusiast.  He has many poems and a few
short stories "on" the subject.  The movie Hoop Dreams is a real eye
opener that even the non-enthusiast will find very intriguing.

quincy's poems are certain for me:  I have "poem for magic" on the
factory school site, which for me is a quintessential basketball
poem.  on the other side would be kool keith's song "n.b.a."  - which
is very biting and critical - from the cd "spankmaster" -

thanks for the suggestions and keep them coming; all of them so far
have been helpful.

Re: songs, there's G. Love and Special Sauce from their
self-titled debut. I think the song's just called
"Basketball," a great sort of whiteboy rap/funk number
about street ball.

for what it's worth, I very rarely use random processes and everything is
reworked

I don't know Jesse Glass but in relation to my work he's absolutely blind

there's nothing right and wrong with random per se - why rehash this

most poetry is boring anywhere and most poetry is meaningless; look at its
huge audience

whatever one wants to do is fine - why worry about categories

and most of anything has no depth

i would say my own work has depth if nothing else and possibly nothing
else

however you define 'depth' - i would say something out of the deep sea;

Politics of the Sneaker Pimps

On the outs I lace up, the world I face up
To score on anybody, its war on everybody
The new guys come in blood shot between the eyes
As long as their sellin that merchandise
And one what goes in don't come back
The color may be green but its also black
And red I know many heads that spent bloodshed
Cursed in converses, dead in Pro Keds
Now every Tom, Dick, Harry or Joe Smith
Skip the spauldings, pony's, and k-swiss
High school and college coaches gettin
Kickbacks from scholarships and them slave ships
Hey Dr. J where you got those moves
Was it gettin high in the schools
Can it be the shoes?
Truth is truth, I tear the fuckin roof off the house
Expose them foes with my mouth
I see corporate hands up in foreign lands
With the man behind the man gettin paid behind the man
I hold the rocket stop the hand in my pocket
200 a pair but I'm addicted to the gear
They'll make me do things on the court to amaze ya
I heard they make em for a buck 8 in Asia
They came a long way baby since
Clyde Frazier had pumas, pullin mad consumers
Them Filas I'm feelin but I cant touch the ceiling
Them New Balance hits 120 million
The last thing I need is Adidas terminatin my contract
For wearing those old pair of wack
Reebok low tops covered up by floppy socks
Gave me a jump shot before I got jumped and shot
Duckin a word from my sponsor
Trying to end my year like Kwaanza
Been paid since the 8th grade
11th grader, pop the champagne
12th grade start the campaign
Gettin fame sign my name in the dotted frame
Nike got me pullin re's and g's
Shit, I can get shot for these
Please god give me 20 more years on these knees
To maintain without this game I gotta do keys
And I don't wanna go there because its fuckin everywhere
Factories wanna be me kids wanna see me
Behind the wheels and endorsement deals
Its the politics and the tricks behind the kicks

PUBLIC ENEMY

Sold / black gold
One strong buck
To the Milwaukee Bucks
For a million bucks
Just get em off the street
So he don't get bucked
Super agent to rescue
So he won't get fucked
Ya run nigger run
To the auction block
But you can't pledge alliegance
To the block
This buck right here
The right kind a stock
For sale for passin
The right kind a rock
Auctioneer stern to massa falk
Can a nigga go home
Where he used to walk
Come back but super agent
Said you can't talk
I didn't know basketball had a balk
The buck run laps
While they run craniums
Players be drainin em
Owners be claimin em
Super agents framin em
Then nicknamin em
Tra win their ass
To be packin them stadiums
In the players ear
Word for word verbatim
Super agent got em locked
Coaches be hatin em
Super agent wouldn't even
Come in my hood
If I had no skills
Was wack and no good
In my neck of the woods
The leagues concrete
And one can only dream about wood
Yeah deal the grade
Let the bills get paid
Pay respect to the projects
And the half-court rejects
Scholarship save that college
Shit
Them championships
Don't pay for the head trips Fuck the trophy
Find the loot
Then approach me
Land of milk and honey
Can I get a quickness
To the money
Or a witness four ______ years
I ain't wit this
Hell with the NCAA ____ / because
My super agents paid
With his dollars I can buy a fuckin college
Miss the rah rah campuses
And keep the school buses
Lookin who's lovin ya
Goin for the jugular
They know they can't
Contain me on the regular
Pimps, pushers
Pocketbook guzzler
Would you pardon my father
Mr. Governor
Thought he had it made
Dreamin about a trade
The thanks we get
Put the roof on this bitch
Dark side of the room
When he jumped the broom
Super agent got this player
Nine-figure wages
Back of sports pages
Off ghetto stages
Shootin sleepin pills
And runnin to the hills
Starmaker makin stars
Hockin burgers and cars
Superstar
How you get to where you are CHORUS
Chillin off the court
See the nigga got bought
Got kicked out the sport
Unseen hand made em
Kiss the ass of the man
One cursed the flag
Everybody ran
Super agent where are you now?
Have you found another brother
To be your cow
Cause you fumbled my shit
And dropped the ball
You won't even answer my call Bridge
Can I get a chance
If I don't sing or dance
Write about romance
Or wear short pants
So I rave and rant
You can't say I can't
Get my grants
Col chillin in a B Boy stance

Check out Victor Coleman's book of poetry, Terrific at Both Ends.
Victor is a great basketball fan/poet, whose only fault is that he is
a Syracuse supporter.

-CR- is pleased to announce
the publication of

-Chicago Review- 48:3/4
"NEW WRITING IN GERMAN"

This 360-page double issue brings together more than fifty
German-language writers, particularly those who have emerged
since 1989 and those not well-represented in English translation.

Select contributors include: Marcel Beyer, Ulrike Draesner,
Jenny Erpenbeck, Gerhard Falkner, Durs Gruenbein, Judith Hermann,
Thomas Kling, Terezia Mora, Raoul Schrott, Ruth Schweikert, Alissa
Walser, Lutz Seiler, and Peter Waterhouse. (A full list of contribs
is available at http://humanities.uchicago.edu/review -- follow
the "forthcoming" link.)

The 1990s were marked by a range of new directions in
German-language poetry and prose, wch the editors have surveyed
in their critical introduction. That introduction also includes a
brief account of their principles of selection:

"Our points of departure were quite simple. We wanted to include
as many interesting poets as we could find from the last fifteen years
or so, along with several older, significant, and underrecognized
'big guns.' For prose fiction, a considerably broader and denser field,
our approach has been diagnostic and investigative: to see who right
now and in the past decade may be considered heirs of the 'grand
signeurs' of postwar German literature."

This issue is available from yr local bookseller (keep yr eye peeled
for the orange cover!), from SPD, and from -CR- directly -- see below
for our specially discounted subscription rate for Poetics list members.

GERMAN PRESS RESPONSES TO "NEW WRITING IN GERMAN"

Across the Pond
An American Anthology of Contemporary German Literature

How do you translate "Schlappschwanzliteratur" -- the phrase Maxim=20
Biller concocted to annoy his fellow writers -- into English? Chicago=20
Review's quite plausible suggestion is "wanker literature." The=20
journal has just put out a double issue devoted to (mostly recent)=20
contemporary German-language writing, titled "New Writing in German"=20
(Chicago Review 48:2/3, Summer 2002). In their introduction, the=20
publishers of this intelligently composed anthology take stock of=20
concepts provided by recent German criticism ("Pop literature," "the=20
new narrativity," "Das Fr=E4uleinwunder," and "multicultural=20
literature"), but fortunately they give preference to a laconically=20
alphabetical ordering of the volume's contents, which, we were glad=20
to see, are divided equally between the rubrics of poetry (from=20
Juergen Becker to Thomas Kling and Peter Waterhouse) and fiction=20
(from Marcel Beyer to Ingo Schulze and Feridun Zaimoglu).

Well-known translators, including Christopher Middleton and Rosmarie=20
Waldrop, have made sure that many of the texts find a second home in=20
America. The anthology -- which leaves out Enzensberger and Grass,=20
but for that includes Mayr=F6cker and Pastior -- is available in this=20
country as well, at the Literarisches Colloquium Berlin, Am=20
Sandwerder 5, 14109 Berlin (www.lcb.de), for a paltry 15 Euro. lmue.

New Writing: From German in English

The literary journal Chicago Review has brought out a volume titled=20
"New Writing in German" representing poetry and prose by younger (as=20
well as older) German authors in English translation. Now for the=20
first time, interested readers have the opportunity to get to know=20
the diversity of contemporary German literature, and not just more of=20
the same. In Germany, the 300+ pages-thick volume can be obtained for=20
15 Euro through the Literarisches Colloquium Berlin, Am Sandwerder 5,=20
14109 Berlin.

after reading the posts this week I would be interested ib buying some of Cid Corman's books (Maybe from Black Sparrow) as a way of helping him with his current situation, but this seems fraught with problems, the first of which is who gets the money?

Amazon?
Black Sparrow?
Borders?

Yes, it seems to me also that it's a question of what aspects of the work the artist permits
randomness to operate on, and the particular nature of the selection process within which the
random is operative. Rather than a "blanket" question of whether random process is desirable or
not.

For instance, in generative music, the process of selection is usually quite structured,
particularly if the music is rhythmic, even if there is randomness within the structured
selection process.

Some works involving random selection/generation:
http://vispo.com/animisms/enigman2
http://vispo.com/animisms/enigman/meaning.html
http://vispo.com/animisms/SeattleDrift.html
http://vispo.com/arteroids

In some of these, you will probably be able to spot the random elements without looking at the
source code. In others, you would probably have to look at the code. In these four pieces, the
random process is prominent only in the first. It's my first try at, um, generative music/sound
poetry.

It is also possible to 'weight' the randomness in certain directions, ie, load the probabilities
in certain directions while not eliminating the random altogether.

Randomness does not provide depth. It provides variability of whatever particular element is
randomized. This variability may contribute to 'depth' in certain ways, but depth and
variability are not even remotely the same thing.

I don't know Jesse Glass but in relation to my work he's absolutely blind.
I would extend that to most of what I see on the computer screen--I'm
wearing triple-strength bifocals now.  I recognize a factory when I see it,
though, and that is what I really object to.  Your work is typical, but your
process of "publication" is what bothers me most.  Factories are no fun for
the people who are forced to work at the end of the line.  On the other hand
they must be real ego trips for the owners.  You've set yourself up as a
factory Alan, and you are ramming your products down the collective throats
of this list.  You are colonizing my hard-drive, with no apologies.  When I
signed up to this list in 1998 I did not sign up to the Alan Sondheim list.
I signed on to the Poetics list.  Sondheim does not equal poetics.  You are
taking advantage of a great forum and if everyone posted their limit every
day for the next year they could not catch up with your excessive postings.
If this were an edited forum, or an e-magazine you would be forced to find
other venues, but as it is we have hot and cold running Alan, and I
absolutely think it's wrong.

Why do you post so much?  It must be ego.  Why don't you remove your name
from your postings for awhile so that we can all see just how unique your
work is.  Or, better yet, why don't you try something new.  I disagree with
Tom Bell when he calls computer work cutting edge.  As it stands right now
it does not matter how much you augment your capabilities via computer, if
you haven't got talent to begin with it doesn't matter how many rams you've
got.  You'll just produce a yawn.  But as it is, Alan did say something
correct and I congratulate him for it.  It's not often that the directors of
big corporations address those who are not expected to complain.   Jesse

What's wrong with a healthy ego? If Alan's IS good then its good he IS proud
of his work and likes to see his work on the List. Long live intelligent
egotism. That is, healthy self-love: not arrogance. I think Alan's posts
include some of the most interesting stuff on when I have time for  it. The
very mass of it the largeness of it the audacity of it the craziness of it
the impudence  of it the strangeness of it the passion of it the obsession
of it the gusto of it the lovely ego of it fascinate me. Buy another hard
drive and get a CD writer etc so you can  'capture' Alan's works. At the
very least they are lively, energetic....Richard.  (from Aotearoa)

by Kurt Schwitters
Edited and translated by Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris

from the back cover:

"The Trojan war cannot have been as full of incident as one day in
Schwitters' life. When he was not writing poetry, he was pasting up
collages. When he was not pasting up, he was building his column, washing
his feet in the ssame water as his guinea pigs, warming his paste-pot in the
bed, feeding the tortoise in the rarely used bathtub, declaiming, drawing,
printing... and in the midst of all this he never forgot, wherever he went,
to pick up discarded rubbish and store it in his pockets." -- Hans Richter

here are few small excerpts to whet the appetites:

part of the beauty of alan's work is the imaginative ways he finds of
disseminating his work; i.e. using listservs as a publishing venue,
as they are already a public forum of sorts.  also, there are many
reasons for high-volume publishing other than "ego."  Without
attributing any of these specifically to sondheim, some of them might
be: obsessive/compulsive tendencies, a belief in process, an ethic of
transparency, a working method that *requires* imminent publication
as part of its constraint system, etc etc.  please, gentlemen, avoid
ad hominem attacks that involve accusations of egotism and lack of
talent.  you both seem like intelligent and talented folks.

Waiting for Book Six to Begin   or   “It’s an allegory isn’t it”?


Aware of the dearth of diners, blinking in the neon ensparkled air, the
companions converged on a shop selling bagels, offering ten ducats a dozen

“I don’t sell to anachronisms” the young rapscallion salesclerk said. “Get
out of my store!”

Abashed and  ashamed our captain said “heigh ho” and we heigh hoed, all the
way down Broadway.  This was Book Six and we were dreading it.

“It’s an allegory” said little Achmed, at least once a block. “Just a bloody
allegory!” We all cheered, but subdued. “The Author didn’t know about the
PCBs,” said another, “that’s not part of the deal.” “I didn’t sign up for
this!” a third began. “Shut yer face!” someone said, loudly. This was me.
We none of us choose our fate so why bellyache?

“It’s just a matter of which river,”  said the captain.  “I admit I’m lost.”
“We’re gonna have to pay the oarsman extra if we make him wait two days.
Union rates.  Time and a half for evenings and nights.” Achmed cleared his
throat.  “Excuse me honored sir captain?  As treasurer of this...
um...endeavor I have to warn you that our funds are coming to an end. I
suggest we go straight to book seven.”

Nonsense said Fred.  Fred is not too bright.  He is a hero:  Heavy footed
Fred. With one step he can squash sheep and goats beneath his feet,
accomplishing slaughter and meat tenderizing in a single step. Fred hasn’t
read the book  so he doesn’t know about Book Six.   Someone asks him how
good he is at killing three-headed dogs. “I can kill any kind of dog,” Fred
said.  “Even a dog that’s already dead?” I asked. “No problemo.  Fred said.
Show me dog, will kill.”

This is one of my "Joan" poems -- she's a narrative voice I sometimes use.
She also wrote a letter to the MTA asking where they buried the body in the
Uptown 34th street IRT station (due to odor of rotting), and she thinks that
all Arab falafel makers are in league agaist her and communicate evil
messages to her by ripping her straw wrapper or putting too much tahini on,
in extreme cases.
------------------

I Have Lost My Mind Somewhere on The West Side Highway


I have lost my mind.
Would you help me find it please?
It can’t have gone far.

Last night Bin Laden drove me to see the shrink
At least he looked like Bin Laden
He had a very long beard
and drove well

I dreaded being asked whether anything unusual had happened to me recently–
a way doctors use to find out of the world you live in
is disconnected from theirs,
which their MDs give them the right to dub real

Yes, bin laden drove me to see you
I would have to say
he was a very good driver
and got me here on time even though I was late to begin with
only you always run late so you wouldn’t know

he mumbled in a semitic language into a cell phone throughout the drive
then took out a little prayer mat and stuck it under his rather shapely rump
and got out a holy book and began to pray

I think it was in Arabic but frankly with the  meds you give me even English
looks like Arabic
making reading rather difficult
I think I’ll enroll in an Arabic class so I can read the Times Bestsellers
again

I thought maybe it was my patriotic duty
to unman this driver
by pulling on the end of his turban
and unrolling it
and then I’d get to see if he had nice hair, too

But the speeds on the West Side Highway made me wary of this course of
action
what if, turbanless, the man could no longer drive and I were to get
stranded
somewhere between the Intrepid
and the Convention Center
It wouldn’t do.

I don’t remember his medallion number or his name on the posted license but
that doesn’t matter because I’m sure it was fake.

I was afraid he’d use the car as a car bomb with me still in it, he seemed
so eager to drive on
he really was a very good driver

but no, dr. elshrinko, nothing at all unusual has happened in the month
since I saw you
I no longer spot celebrities in the street
you said that was an illusion but I know they are avoiding me
because you have robbed me of my power

I stick to down to earth things as recommended.
I have taken up philately.
I got a pen-pal in Kenya.
I volunteer at the hospital bringing ice water to the patients
but I stay strictly out of their affairs as directed by you
I have accepted that romance is not in the cards for people like me;
instead we get the love and fellowship of friendship of fellow clients in
day program
it is almost a family
yes, dr. elshrinko, I have accepted all of this

but why then, would bin laden be picking me, me in particular up to drive to
see you?
he must want to make peace, with me as his instrument
will you help me contact the media?

what?

you want to up my meds?
but I can see.  I can think.  I am myself, or at least a self
I don’t care if my experiences are a little unusual
I’m an unusual person

I don’t want to fit in anyway.
do you really want to risk locking me up when I know bin laden?

he could come and destroy the whole hospital except for me.
oh well.
the cops again.
I guess you win.

bye bye Osama!  You can come out of the corner now.  It seems clear that
elshrinko can’t see you...

As for the rest of it, I could care less about how often Sondheim posts -- or
anyone else for that matter.  I use my delete key liberally.  I'm on so many
lists that if I read each and everyone of the posts I receive, I'd have
little time for anything else.  I might be more inclined to follow threads
regarding Sondheim if the discussions focused on his work instead of the
frequency and volume of posts.

Collaborative efforts with fellow poets, but also with artists from other
disciplines, are great ways to expand one's own horizon and potentially the
field as a whole. I once had the opportunity to write movements for Ken James
who is a choreographer/dancer with Fellow Travellers Performance Group, a Bay
Area dance company.  Three years later that project continues to resonate for
me.  More recently Jessica Grim and I have attempted some co-written texts,
one of which (And Or Not) is due out in a forthcoming issue of Raddle Moon.

Collaboration can break down hierarchy, it can take one out of the habitual
range of reference.  It is also quite challenging.  I'd like to do it more
often.  And I'd like to see more of it going on. I've often wondered why
collaborative writing projects aren't attempted more often on this list.

--you
&
anyone else--

are invited to cocreate at the swiki we have set up below.  from what I can tell
there have been 10-20 folks consistently working on the site since it was
invigorated at the beginning of the month.  I have done extensive collaboration
with other writers over the the years in a one to one form of exchange but this
kind of space requires even deeper observations of one's ego, identity,
aesthethics, expectations & a kind of thorough letting go that I find myself
enjoying more & more.  I also find that there is a lot of listening & reading
going on in the space, many of the additions are quite thoughtful & often
polymorphic in how they graft themselves onto a document (72 pages created so
far) in a way that defies identification with an individual recognizable
signature.

kari.  I like this.  Influenced by Stein (who hasnt been?) but i like it eg
I like your use of  "a pause" for what is literally a a pause....even
reminds me fleetingly of  "a pause,a rose, something on paper" (Heijinian of
course): maybe it has  that "quietness" in it.  Good stuff I feel. Richard

Not everyone. Somehow,

the spokes of the day exhaled
in water like the thunder of bungee
lettering, and I painted myself
to the chair again, baby, just like

breaking in the middle like this
does no good. My dad was a truck driver and
a muscle car dipped in rust. Like candy,

my throat glorifies morning with
a whole afternoon's worth of
sandwhiches wroth with thickness.
This won't help me pass my GRE! If

Dad had saved face with this nubile
lurid cream, we would all have severed
ties with a corporate potato tattoo
splashed seductively across my forearm.
Wanna see me flex, baby? The creases

in the sky are arguable; some of us
are horrifically in love with them.

Free idea for opera, musical comedy, fiction or poem(depending on one's genre
orientation):

a protagonist who deals with stressful situations by bursting into song.
Protagonist does not sing well at all and is singing in wildly inappropriate
contexts.  The nominal "plot" would consist of a sequence of stressful
situations.

I have briefly experimented with this approach to life and especially
recommend medleys of Tom Jones songs.  Although badly sung opera is
interesting also.  Sometimes Donna ain't mobile at all.

Joe,

With that last post from you re: Sondheim, and in the context of
numerous recent and satisfied comments from others about how
the list is "unedited," how overposting may have many "healthy"
reasons, etc., I'm really surprised that you (who has published
material on the '98 expulsions) didn't remind people that the list, in
fact, is NOT "unedited," since the continuing proscription of
individuals from the list (there are now at least five, apparently, as a
well-known poet and editor of my acquaintance, who has had some
past arguments with Charles Bernstein, has been trying to join and
keeps getting rejected) is the grossest and most vulgar form of
"editing" one can carry through.

Mind you, I probably wouldn't rejoin anyway myself, but don't you
think it is a bit revolting, from an poetical-ethical point of view, that
1000 poets go happily on conversing away while the *censorship of
banishment* continues as policy behind the curtain?

Wouldn't it be interesting to be impolite and raise the issue
directly? It would be a much more interesting topic of discussion,
probably, than the silly non-issue of Alan Sondheim's volume of
postings, or poems about basketball, though a free list will always
have topics like these, too... For a long time, the matter's been
contained as a dark, little secret, a boxed-up embarrassment no
one wants to talk about. But I've always said it's an issue that will
be aired and analyzed in the future in a prominent way (relatively
speaking, of course-- our poetry sub-culture is small), and I remain
convinced that will be the case. And those who speak up now will
most certainly be respected now and later for doing so.

Sending this cc. to a bunch of other people who have posted in
August, who have either been concerned with the Poetics list issue
in the past, or who have made statements in the past about the
value of open and democratic discourse in poetry.

For whatever it's worth, I'd love to see Kent and others back on Poetics -
I think they should at least try and resub.

Kent, et. al.,

I'm opposed to the exclusions--and would urge all affected to continue to try
and resub-- but am dubious of yr perspective that the 1000 or so poets on the
list are "happily" conversing.  This from the standpoint of one who has
dropped off the list on a number of occasions over the last few years.

We aren't a particulary cohesive group of individuals. Cyclic patterns of
rapture-to-rupture, along with whatever's in the repertoire, seem to be in
play at all levels most of the time. It's frustrating, energizing, enervating
and frictive.

There's a spectre haunting the Poetics List: the spectre of ___________?

Love,

Tom Beckett

What twaddle. There are umpteen poetry lists. A listowner has the right to
remove particular people if they see fit. Nowhere here, or in the rest of
this self-congratulatory screed, is there any mention of the numerous
listmembers who felt intimidated by those ended up being removed.
Intimidated to the point where they felt they didn't dare post. BTW What
kind of a snob thinks "vulgar" is an insult?

Then we get the phrase

*censorship of
> banishment*

self-inflatory twaddle.

Later on

This is risible,  classic obsessive-compulsive snow tactics. Repetition,
albeit with monomaniacal variation, doesn't make something true.

That a list is open and democratic, vulgar even, doesn't mean that it's
impossible to be thrown out.

his work is worth two mentions.

hi, a friend asked me about where to send work to journals. this
person is not new to performing and publishing but is new to the
types of venues probably most represented on this list. My knowledge
is more than a little out of date, so I'm not likely to know what
people are doing anymore.

I'm at a loss as to how to reply and wondering if there is there a
good source to find current literary magazines -- perhaps a website?
-- and it would be useful to know what types of work these
journals/presses accepted, if applicable.

If you are someone on this list who edits and/or publishes a poetry
periodical or knows of some good journals, small presses, etc., some
information would be very much appreciated.  back channel or not, but
please help.

As many people suspect, we're hunting larger game than Alan Sondheim's
over-postings.

Silly non-issues?  I'd say you have a few hobby horses you've ridden into
the ground, Kent, with a lot less reason.

I agree with Alan and the others that you and Hen should come back, but
spare me the dark plot and violins.

Stop swinging your arms around, Kent, and be a friend,

Jess

Actually, I understand why Kent would call my attempted criticsm of Alan's
over-postings a non-issue, because both have the same mode of operation:
they're both prolific in their postings, and neither of them appear to give
a good god damn about what other people think.  I think enthusiasm for a
subject is good, but it also has a down-side.  Both Kent and Alan do not
appear to have any understanding of polite limits and I really find this
absolutely "American" and absolutely rude.

Alan's factory, and his unapologetic use of it to spew forth, reminds me of
George Bush--the head of the largest over-producing, spewing factory in the
world.  Both seem to have a feeling of "entitlement" that escapes me.  We'll
let others debate the issue about Bush, but why does Alan feel that he is
entitled to empty his outbox onto this list and onto my hard-drive?  I don't
think he's earned the right to do this steadily now for four years or more.
Someone mentioned that Alan's a genius, but nothing I see on this list
indicates that to me.

Well, Alan, let's hear it.  What gives you the right to clutter up my hard
drive with your work?  Why do you feel entitled to post your "creative"
productions over and over to this discussion list?

What I see of Alan's work comes through on this list as numbers, letters,
and words that to someone trained in literature and art, and with more than
an adequate understanding of most things--including computers--appears
assuredly electronic, but less than literature if you've just spent the
morning reading Pope, Emily Dickinson or David Jones.  I don't argue that
some computer programming takes place behind the screen in order to produce
the product.  I'm simply judging the product in light of a long tradition of
literary excellence and in that light what Alan does fails miserably.  Alan
also seems to have his own compulsions that he appears to be working out on
this list in terms of violence, porn, and other sexual issues, and perhaps
some of those, too, would be better appreciated elsewhere by his fans.

I'm only familiar with what Alan does from what I've seen on this list.  I
haven't sought his work out elsewhere, because--frankly--it bores me.

I've said this repeatedly, but I'll say it again: why can't Alan simply post
links to this list instead of throwing absolutely everything he writes on my
computer--and this is "My Computer" and I do have a right to participate on
this list without changing anything in my settings.  He surely has his fans,
and I bet that most of them--if not all--would go that extra "click" for
their inspiring leader.

Discussion I think is great.  I'm just talking about Alan's "creative" work.

Maybe this is all happening because I have lived in Japan for 10 years--long
enough to have my teeth set on edge when I see an American walking through
as if he or she owns the world and deserves the world's applause.

Both Kent and Alan appear to have abundant time to post to these lists, and
both have the incredible advantage of not having to pay per 3 minute unit to
broadcast their opinions and works abroad.  I really envy that, because I
have to keep my eye on the clock when I'm on the net.

I want to add that I'm not the only person on this list who feels this way.

Jesse. Re Americans ...I'm not one and I asume that you are albeit having
lived in Japan and I know what you are saying: its a generalisation but yes
I findmany "eastern ' people are more considerate and so on: however I dont
think that you shoud confuse the issue by linkning  a Alan to Bush! But I do
agree with you that latter gentleman: in fact he and certain Americans I
meet tend to have 9aprt from other things) a kind of thinking (I dont think
they sit down and "work it out") but iits as if the US was a huge island:
I've noticeedthis attitude inmany: but these are big generalities: most
people any where are good.

Re Alan you know I am inteested in his work: it kind of amazesme...I dont
think it was I said he was a genius. I think I was being a bit flip when
Isaid he was either a madman or a genius:i think it more true to say he is
passionate. What he is doing exactly I dont know: although I talked to him
and he took an old book about New Zealnd n exchange for his CD ROM.  One of
the few Americas I've "met" who'se  expressed the slightest interest in this
country - where by the way the first radio transmissions were sent by Ernest
Ruthorford, and one of its citizens was the first to climb Mt Everest and
where the first coommercial radio station was first in op and we introduced
the vote for women.....ok some boasting to counter that "mythical?" arrogant
Yank.....at least he recieved the book.

I have feeling that Alaan simply need to do what he is doing: he did ask
once (about three months ago) if we thought he should proceed and most I
think agreed that he should.

And how (serious question and I agree that the writers you mentioned are all
good) but how do you know that Alan isnt another ..ok another Pessoa or the
W H Auden of America....?  I dont: I am veryinteerested in a lot of wht he
is doing.  It  IS  repetitive at times but and maybe has weaknesses etc but
I honestly havent had time to adjudge it. I only write when thmood or the
feeling of "inspriation" comes upon me else I have a project about my own
life and my children etc  which I want tobroaden  somewhat nii the manner sy
o Patterson or "A" but I just do a bit now and then. It doensnt obsess me.
But I think that Alan is driven as they say...I'm not a personal friend of
Alans's only an e - aquaintance and byy and large find him at least a
phenomenom.  I have ateoryalso that all the greta poets and writers of the
heritage you refer to were in some ways all talking to themselves: people
who dont want to listen. They want to out out. By ad large I'm like that: I
like (especially if I give a reading) I love the attention and applause I
get and I dont listen much to anynone else. So I think that somewhat poets
etc are people who arent, by and large good interpersonal communicators - or
they have had some difficulties at some time in this: their creativity is
thus a kind of "talking" to make up for a kind of hiatus in this area.
However this is another generalisation....

But how do the messages clutter your hard drive: I'm not certain on this but
I thought that if you delte messages from the (in my case I have a folder
called "deleted items" )   - however I think they do remain somewhow as I
used GO BACK and some things I thought had been destroyed reaapeared: so
maybe its difficult to "unclutter " our hard drive. I'm not sure about this.

Two postings a day is too few.  Kent etal should e allowed back on: that's
called freedom of speech.

On my planet, tell me what dowager gawks
as the suns that triple cells quadruple
across our sky a jelly with lead and fantastic
sadness in store for you. What derringers god

the tinfoil space helmet on the astronaut
that glisters and twists with everything fanatic
as the red rum seas ripen to a faster purple
and our leader in fear begins closing the docks

to insure us no viral bouquet of foreign shots
on my planet arraigns us. We know what bitter churl
can do, what dulcimer mutes, in jealous, attack;
for these light years among deathly rocks we sought

drier plateaus, raised above our worst of dreams.
Such sadness rung up when just one of us leaves.

I like the sun chips away at everything.
Explosions of crepe dogwood at warp pink
and purple wallop, as in high yellow pavements

push feet from dissonance to sober waking. She's

in right now around the television just un-smudging
her eyes from where we unraveled our streaming
on sheets. There's a sliding glass door separates us.

This is the bridge between two bodies among
the clock. My computer breathes on and off.

Our hearts

Consider this quote by (sorry) Carl Sagan,

The question is not whether you are right or wrong, sir.  You are not even
in the conversation.

Consider the implications and applications of this quote.  Consider the
logic of it.  Consider the mentality of he or she who would take recourse to
such logic.

A good seventy percent of what is posted to this list is, at best, beside
the point of this list.

Question:  Has the List become decadent?  Is the list decadent?

Hi All,
I have a book coming out from Coffeehouse Press post April 15th, 03, and I
need to set up some readings to promote it. Anywhere in the country is fine,
Im trying to put together some sort of tour. I was wondering if anyone on the
list could provide information on any readings series or curators for me. All
information and suggestions would be appreciated. Please backchannel.

Yours,
Brenda Coultas

The Egolessness of Egolessness

(Excuse the verbosity verging on otiosity! The ferocity verging on
pomposity! Etc. I do my best to keep things short, but I was born to ramble,
so ramble on I must.)


Lots of voices kicking in on this topic. I hope that's a good thing and
isn't turning people off. Here are my latest responses to the considered
refutations and maddeningly oracular pronunciamentos that have followed in
the wake of my last posting.

First off, I hope I don't come across as sounding too authoritative, as I
would prefer to remain problematized by my own weakly submerged (for me)
contradictions. Indeed, this is what I cherish most about the process of
thought, that the mind (if healthy) naturally resists following a single,
dogmatic path for too long and turns repeatedly to nothingness for
confirmation of its sustained existence. (Thus spake Blanchot! Sort of.)

But seriously, the last thing I want to do here is to pit pro- and
anti-randomness forces against each other in some kind of gladiator fight to
the death. As I think my words have indicated, I see art as being a soluble
solution comprised of both randomness and necessity, but at a level of depth
that cannot be indicated by any algorithm or mere toss of the dice.

"Depth" is one of those woefully fuzzy words I frankly don't like to lean
upon except when I cannot think of a replacement. For me it is simply an
indication of something that is endlessly complex. Randomness as such is not
endlessly complex. It has one level of complexity and that's it. (Can even
be quantified.) Good art has depth. A good meal has depth. Andy Warhol has
depth. Nature has depth, even though it is intensely random in certain ways.
It is also highly structured down to the finest detail, which to me makes
the balance work. (Thank - God?)

The reason I feel that certain usages of randomness are pernicious and need
to be rooted out is because the result can be so deceptive. What may seem
like the full depth of thought in a work of art may actually not be deep at
all but merely the product of a banal random generative device. Like that
old A-I psychiatrist (Eliza?) who would dispense pseudo-authoritative advice
without any true understanding of the patient's illness. Art that is built
upon a random algorithm instead of making the hard choices and connections
that a mind must make in putting together a work of adequate complexity is a
castle made of sand. It may look strong and fortified to the uninitiated -
until the first wave comes in and washes it all away. (Of course if a work
deals with such devices in some meta-critical fashion then there may be a
good justification in using them. I am not laying down any chiseled rules,
okay?)

Resorting to stupid randomness tricks to deprive oneself of the "tyranny" of
the authorial voice is clearly throwing the baby out with the bath water.
There are more effective methods that still preserve the mind's maze-work of
mixed intentions such as Rimbaud's derangement of the senses. Computers have
made things like text-scrambling widely available at the click of a mouse,
which is exactly why they must be resisted. (But NOT necessarily rejected!)
Unfortunately, the more computers become a part of our working lives the
more such tricks will be resorted to by those who seek the easy way out. But
just because the "Author" is dead doesn't mean the critic should just roll
into his grave as well!

If you inspect a typical aleatoric process like a random walk or Markov
chain you will note that it looks only one step back (or at most a few) at a
time to decide its current move. Such an approach is simply too shallow to
serve as the scaffolding for a complex work of art. By contrast, if you look
at the way the mind works, it sees everything in its completeness as well as
its partiality. It grasps the global and the local, the end and the
beginning, the fragment and the whole - and does so amazingly all at once.
There is (yet?!) no purely artificial way of achieving this degree of
gestaltification, in art or in life.[*] Bataille - a strong advocate of the
violence of the arbitrary, by the way - puts it nicely: "To live: to rebegin
that which finishes without finishing." Why would anybody wish to replace
what the admittedly mortal, limited mind does so brilliantly and (so far as
we know) uniquely with a cheap simulacrum, unless it be through laziness or
the desire to deceive?

[*] Indeed, one definition of a computer might be that it is a mind
incapable of metaphor. (Debatable point?)

Next I move on to defending the glorious un-facility of Cage. I would say
that the reason the randomness in Cage's approach to art attains depth is
because of the way he forged an alliance between world, work and life. Cage
demonstrates through every aspect of his being - his art, teachings and
interactions with people - that randomness is not merely the fluffy icing on
the cake but an integral part of one's being fully alert to the world's
contingencies and continuities. His connection with oriental cultures is not
insignificant in this regard, as they have been among those that have most
fully embraced the effects of chance in the creation of a life's work that
is in tune with transpersonal forces of preservation and change.

I now would like to carry on a bit longer about Cage, whose entire body of
work I believe I know rather well, so here I say to begin

TRANSFER INTERRUPTED!

Hm. Am I back? There's a story that somebody tells about the painter Jackson
Pollock. (I think it's Julian "too deep for his own good" Schnabel.) While
visiting him in his home, somebody tells Pollock that his work looks merely
like a bunch of random drips and drabs. At which point Pollock angrily grabs
a brush and flicks a long loogie of paint across the room that lands cleanly
on the distant doorknob. What Pollock does in his painting is like finely
aimed archery. It cannot be considered random except insofar as any painting
that is not absolutely precise in all particulars is such.

Process? You will hear no blanket condemnations from me - wet or otherwise!
Except insofar as process is embraced for its rationality and not its
hopelessness. (Check out the classic minimalists, for instance, and see how
their influence traces directly back to the pessimistic yearnings of
Beckett.)

To me one of the strongest reasons for using randomness in art is that it
puts us more acutely in touch with the pervasive randomness that affects us
in our daily lives. Whether it be:  - to come upon a man who puts his knife
in one's back (shades of Beckett!) . . . to stumble upon some shard of
driftwood on the beach that brings forth memories of one's long dead uncle
(shades of Proust!) . . . to be made aware of the flux of reality that is
usually darting about below one's sensorial radars until it breaks to the
surface of consciousness during those rare heightened moments when
everything is seen as one (shades of Darwin!) . . . How's that for a
magnanimous gesture of harmony and reconciliation!

Straight man question (to all): If form is emptiness what is structure?

Is randomness then more contingency, a sense that a work would have been
different if created any other time, under different circumstances?
Randomness as a possibility of change in a work, simultaneously complete and
unfinishd?

Works of poetry also get distributed  randomly, as fragments (or fragment),
evoking a strong memory in another poet.

This is my last reply to Jesse Glass.

If you don't like my work or the huge frequency of 1/2 a day, just set
your email filter. You constantly complain about my posts filling up your
hard drive - which wouldn't even be the case in 1984. You can quite
ignore them.

Genius is always in the eyes of the beholder; I don't claim one way or
another.

If you don't know how to filter, or if pushing delete is too difficult for
you, just write to me or the list and I will tell you.

Your posts are insulting. I have no idea who or what you are, but you
apparently expect me to respect you in spite of them. I don't, and I would
just as soon not have you read my work myself.

And as I've said repeatedly, I'm on numerous lists, as are most people,
where people post up to 5-10 times a day, without issue. I don't like a
lot of the posts and some of the people, so I don't read them - so what?n

Either try the delete key or set up a filter.

Finally, as someone said, this is tiresome, and I apologize to the list
myself - this should be a non-issue. If someone wants to discuss my
writing, that would be great; but talking about its appearance, when it's
so easy to eliminate, seems to me an insult to others. And Jesse, it's
been 8 years, not 4.

just to nervously recap:

are you positive LOCAL HISTORIES isn't hidden inside ARCADE?  I can't get an

SPD seems to say limited availability on LH . . .

Subject:      Help prevent a war on Iraq
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The Bush White House is aggressively promoting war on Iraq, against
the advice of its diplomats, and without strong support from Congress,
the American public, or our allies.

Please join me in signing an online petition to oppose a war that would
likely undermine both national and world security.  Let&#8217;s show our
representatives that they have strong public support to stop this war.

If you join me in signing today, your comments will be hand-delivered
to your Senators as part of a national day of action on August 28th.
Constituent meetings are being organized with Senate offices everywhere.

Sign the petition at:

  http://www.moveon.org/nowar/

It's important that we speak out against a war in which many of our
young people, and likely many more innocent Iraqis, would die.

Even top Republican leaders are publicly questioning a war:

Brent Scowcroft, the former National Security Advisor, says a U.S.
invasion of Iraq "could turn the whole region into a cauldron and,
thus, destroy the war on terrorism."  He also says "there is scant
evidence to tie Saddam to terrorist organizations, and even less to
the Sept. 11 attacks."

Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) says the CIA has "absolutely no evidence"
that Iraq possesses or will soon possess nuclear weapons.

Henry Kissinger says, "The notion of justified pre- emption runs
counter to modern international law, which sanctions the use of force
in self-defense only against actual -- not potential -- threats."
Kissinger also says, "American military intervention in Iraq would be
supported only grudgingly, if at all, by most European allies."

Dick Armey, the House Majority Leader (R-TX-26), says, "I don't believe
that America will justifiably make an unprovoked attack on another
nation.  It would not be consistent with what we have been as a nation
or what we should be as a nation."

We've got to speak out too.  Please join me and do your part, at:

  http://www.moveon.org/nowar/

Thank you.

Please forgive the length of this posting.

I've been lurking a bit, enjoying the give and take between various members
on this topic.    What m*rk writes re:  Rimbaud and Bataille is clearly
accurate and must seem so to anyone who thinks well about literature --and
that, I assume, includes nearly everyone on this list (perhaps everyone).

The idea that the "tyranny" of the authorial voice can be answered in only
one way amounts to a broad denial of factual evidence, plain and simple.
That the authorial voice operates tyrannically is itself a problematic
stance.  Authority, we know, is rarely tyranny.  The best we can do is tamper
with authorial authority; we can hardly eliminate it since it sources
everything we experience.

We do invariably experience as individuals.  To tamper with the individual
seems more a political gesture that has, politically (not necessarily
aesthetically), thus far failed, simply because it sidesteps the guts of
life.  Rimbaud, De Sade, Rimbaud, Lautreamont, Bataille, Artaud and most
celebrated poets, writers, critics, philosophers understood this.  They had
lives, however messy.  They understood that the "tyranny" was rooted in human
experience, and that art which pretends to eliminate human experience might
be considered "there," but not so much like a tree which is about life and
death, as like a chiseled rock.  Hence the method of derangement of the
senses in some cases which does not throw the baby out with the bathwater, as
m*rk puts it.

Some--not all--have interpreted contemporary language philosophy as a call
for the elimination of the authorial voice from both politics and art.  There
is precious little of that in the actual writings by said philosophers.
Their project is meant to reveal and explain rather than eliminate.  The
disruptive methods they sometimes employ serve the explanation, the
exposition.  They are not meant to obliterate since such an act is impossible
in any event.  The best of these poets, writers, critics, philosophers
understood that the very attempt to obliterate restores in full, because
contingent upon, the power of the authorial voice.

Personally, I support every sort of artistic method in its attempt.  I'll
leave for history the question of how much value a particular method obtains,
though as Jesse Glass has intimated, no individual work of art escapes the
arena of valuation.  Everything connected with human experience is about and
promotes a value.  And only nothing is not connected from any point of view,
since point of view doesn't exist beyond human intervention.

I'd like to suggest an oldie but still a goodie:  Rene Wellek's Concepts of
Criticism.  Although Wellek's overview has been necessarily updated by
Lentricchia and others, his brief section on Paul Valery seems germane to our
discussion.  Valery despised the self and its emotional/tragic gestures which
dominated art, especially novels.  His view was that poetry should aspire to
a cold interlocking of content, form, image, meaning--a blending so perfect
that no one element stood to the front at any time to be recognized and
analyzed.  Form and content are one.  Meaning and image are one.  The critic
would find it near impossible to locate and isolate one element for
discussion.  Anyone familiar with Valery's works knows that the issue of what
they mean is problematic, to say the least.

Valery's method, his "philosophy," as Wellek points out, attempts to remove
the work of art from human history and place it in some absolute,
a-historical dimension (art for art's sake?).  He knew that to accomplish
this he would have to repress the self which thinks, feels, desires, lives
and dies.  T. S. Eliot was much influenced by Valery, though his attempts to
create an impersonal poetry met with mixed success due to the tragicomic
details of his life and personality.  He was, as many are, dissatisfied with
the chisled rock.  He needed the tree.  He was compelled by who he was.
Ashbery is another who takes a "halfwalk" down this road, though similarly
unable to travel the entire distance.  And Coolidge's The Crystal Text, while
ostensibly a meditation on one version of the chisled rock, neverthess moves
many precisely because he does not deny the meditation's agent, the self, as
it contemplates its subject/object.

Wellek points to the austere nature of Valery's ideas and methods.  Some may
call Valery a purist.  I have no objection.  But there is a conservatism
attached to purism, and historically a part of the avant-garde has not been
exempted from said purism/ austerity/conservatism, either politically, or
aesthetically, or both.

Quite frankly, I admire Valery's attempts and his poetic results.  Flaubert's
"book about nothing" has always intrigued me as an idea, even though Flaubert
knew the impossibility of achieving such a work.  My own writing, however,
issues from my preference for the messiness of life and death, the inevitable
intellectual and emotional highs and lows experienced by the individual.  I
want that crucial stuff in my art alongside whatever formal innovations are
available to me, including the interrogation of authorial power.

Poetry which is "about" the details of an individual's living and dying is
not, as some would have it, a merging of art with reportage.  That idea is
just silly.  All art, all "writing," all speaking, mediates the supposed
object under scrutiny and recreates it.  One might even argue that the object
is created in whole.  In that sense, it's all art, and Stevens said as much
even though it wasn't his idea to begin with.  The author's voice, far from
behaving tyrannically as a rule, is coextensive with human experience.  If
this were not true, this listserv would not be possible.  We would not be
talking "about" anything.

Poetry, because its methods are usually different from, say, journalism,
recreates the world in a different, perhaps more important and memorable,
fashion.  There is plenty of historical evidence to suggest the privilege of
poetry's recreations within the human sphere.  In any case, what we
experience, either in poetry or walking down the street, is a recreation.  We
never get the world as it is.  The world as it is is a nonsensical phrase
anyway.  What exists outside of human perception is hardly a world, or
informed by any idea whatsoever.  It is beyond our control.  The recreations,
conceptualizations, in which we live, however, we can control to some degree.


Of course what some refer to when they site tryannical methods is the
politicking within the poetry biz.  Who can deny that.  On the other hand,
the best stuff seems always to rise out of such political and aesthetic
conflicts, like the one between Valery and his imagined opponent.  That's
LIFE.  There is no escape from conflict, from comedy, from tragedy.  Some
would argue that a privileged and relatively peaceful nation--the U.S. for
example, can no longer make great art, that we have been reduced to surface
gestures such as randomness for it's own sake.  I don't know how true that
is, but's it's worth considering.

What I do know is that I understand my writing to be tree-like (ho!), part of
an eco-system, if you will, and not removed from it.  But others have
different ideas, and that's fine with me.  I'm listening.

Best, Bill

a well has depth
i think you imply height
a poem has engagement
what do you mean by depth?
endlessly complex in an emotional way or intellectual or structural way?
a nursery rhyme is endlessly complex

the piece hasn't changed, the once thought 'deep' text is the same as
the now known 'random generated' text. what has changed? the
end-users knowledge that it was created by random process? the change
is within the end-user(reader) not within the poem, no?

according to you, art that is built on rock (i assume you're implying
endurance/canon material) is the creation of the poet, who by "making
the hard choices and connections that a mind must make in putting
together a work of adequate complexity".

you have already said the author is not dead.
you give all power to the author.
that makes you a pre-barthesian formalist, no?
not a very fashionable critic these days.

but perhaps we have really discovered your problem.
you don't like computers. but you cover your arse, "resisted but not
necessarily rejected">
feeling a little threatened by computers in some other area of your life?
have you considered that the new medium requires new strategies for
'reading' and 'writing'.
i know i am much more prepared these days to search much more text,
with my own mental poetry filter, finding what i like and what i
don't like.
my experience is becoming more of-the-moment, less seeking that
enduring poem and sticking with that for the rest of my life.
i am more prepared to contribute to the experience as well, and often
this involves physical as well as mental input.

here you are offering an argument that computers are inferior to the
human mind.
no one here is arguing that the computer is better than the human
mind, we are talking poetics.
what has this to do with your original argument?

Dear Tenney Nathanson,
I have a copy of 'Local History' by Erica Hunt I could
swap with you for something like Ron Padgett's 'Poems
I Guess I Wrote" or 'Albanian Diary' maybe - these
should be available easily in the U.S. shouldn't they
?
I can airmail - you'd have it within a week.
Want to trade ?

Hello Tenney,

Okay, with books side-by-side now, the only overlap I see
from _Local History_ in _Arcade_ is a revised version of "A Coronary
Artist." _Local History_ has three parts: "Local History," "Correspondence
Theory," and "Surplus." Backchannel if you'd like a complete list of poems
from either text.

Best of luck,
Kathy Lou

I like this, especially the ending and the apt and funny code segment.  Plus
I am awed as usual by Alan's ability to make up a cast of chaacters and
interatact with them in their world, a sort of external dissosciative
disorder (in DID your head is involuntarily filled with versions of
yourself, but Alan's deal is the opposite -- the "alters" are voluntary
creatiions, external, and are not parts of Alan axcept in the sense that any
wroter's creations are parts of him.  Yest by creating an Alan character in
their world he appears to interact with teh alters on their level, lot as
their creator.....cool)

  actually, jesse, this won't run either. seems to me you've tried the 'he
posts too much' line, and now its 'he's just like Kent'. alan keeps to the
rules on posting, and Kent is not on the list. the truth is that you don't
like alan's work. that's the issue. but those don't seem to me grounds for
this campaign of yours. indeed your objections at the level of practice have
seemed trivial and shift to the ad hominem far too readily. going by the
discussion you have prompted most people on the list are interested in and
like alan's work. that's largely because its the kind of work we on the list
are here to read and talk about. so let's get serious. tell us about your
'long tradition of literary excellence' which is offended by alan's
practice, and i'll show you my 'long tradition of literary excellence' ...

Subject: Kent and Alan


Actually, I understand why Kent would call my attempted criticsm of Alan's
over-postings a non-issue, because both have the same mode of operation:
they're both prolific in their postings, and neither of them appear to give
a good god damn about what other people think.  I think enthusiasm for a
subject is good, but it also has a down-side.  Both Kent and Alan do not
appear to have any understanding of polite limits and I really find this
absolutely "American" and absolutely rude.

Alan's factory, and his unapologetic use of it to spew forth, reminds me of
George Bush--the head of the largest over-producing, spewing factory in the
world.  Both seem to have a feeling of "entitlement" that escapes me.  We'll
let others debate the issue about Bush, but why does Alan feel that he is
entitled to empty his outbox onto this list and onto my hard-drive?  I don't
think he's earned the right to do this steadily now for four years or more.
Someone mentioned that Alan's a genius, but nothing I see on this list
indicates that to me.

Well, Alan, let's hear it.  What gives you the right to clutter up my hard
drive with your work?  Why do you feel entitled to post your "creative"
productions over and over to this discussion list?

What I see of Alan's work comes through on this list as numbers, letters,
and words that to someone trained in literature and art, and with more than
an adequate understanding of most things--including computers--appears
assuredly electronic, but less than literature if you've just spent the
morning reading Pope, Emily Dickinson or David Jones.  I don't argue that
some computer programming takes place behind the screen in order to produce
the product.  I'm simply judging the product in light of a long tradition of
literary excellence and in that light what Alan does fails miserably.  Alan
also seems to have his own compulsions that he appears to be working out on
this list in terms of violence, porn, and other sexual issues, and perhaps
some of those, too, would be better appreciated elsewhere by his fans.

I'm only familiar with what Alan does from what I've seen on this list.  I
haven't sought his work out elsewhere, because--frankly--it bores me.

I've said this repeatedly, but I'll say it again: why can't Alan simply post
links to this list instead of throwing absolutely everything he writes on my
computer--and this is "My Computer" and I do have a right to participate on
this list without changing anything in my settings.  He surely has his fans,
and I bet that most of them--if not all--would go that extra "click" for
their inspiring leader.

Discussion I think is great.  I'm just talking about Alan's "creative" work.

Maybe this is all happening because I have lived in Japan for 10 years--long
enough to have my teeth set on edge when I see an American walking through
as if he or she owns the world and deserves the world's applause.

Both Kent and Alan appear to have abundant time to post to these lists, and
both have the incredible advantage of not having to pay per 3 minute unit to
broadcast their opinions and works abroad.  I really envy that, because I
have to keep my eye on the clock when I'm on the net.

I want to add that I'm not the only person on this list who feels this way.

I suspect that the original "hostilities came when Kent etal dared to
question the fascist US state-military-financial complex and its continuing
teerrorism since at least the second word war till  now (see john Pilger and
other good journalists whih was probably misinterpreted as an attack on US
citizens or others but was maybe thier  strong views AS RESPONSIBLE US
citizens. Poets should be outspoken and passionate now withh Bush
threatening to attack a country (Iraq see Patrick Herron's posts) that
already has 5000 children dying of cancers caused by US and British
armaments bombarded on there and also becuase they cant get food and medical
suppplies. Probably the List willl die of depravity if DOESNT have Kent etal
back. Its a vital question of the freedom of speech:  the world is
accelerating toward fascism: especially the US and Britain and Israel are
leading the way: my country and Austarlia also are lead by weak grovellors
to the US.

Similarly we need poetic freedom: we cant aloow orselves to be banished as
Ovid was by Augustus.

Maybe Alan could limit his posts but he is a challlenging writer. The filter
or whatever can be turned on I believe....Wystan has a good point in his
post too. It may simply be that his poetry is just too challenging.
Disturbing.

This is my last reply to Jesse Glass.

If you don't like my work or the huge frequency of 1/2 a day, just set
your email filter. You constantly complain about my posts filling up
your
hard drive - which wouldn't even be the case in 1984. You can quite
ignore them.

Genius is always in the eyes of the beholder; I don't claim one way or
another.

If you don't know how to filter, or if pushing delete is too difficult
for
you, just write to me or the list and I will tell you.

Your posts are insulting. I have no idea who or what you are, but you
apparently expect me to respect you in spite of them. I don't, and I
would
just as soon not have you read my work myself.

And as I've said repeatedly, I'm on numerous lists, as are most people,
where people post up to 5-10 times a day, without issue. I don't like a
lot of the posts and some of the people, so I don't read them - so
what?n

Either try the delete key or set up a filter.

Finally, as someone said, this is tiresome, and I apologize to the list
myself - this should be a non-issue. If someone wants to discuss my
writing, that would be great; but talking about its appearance, when
it's
so easy to eliminate, seems to me an insult to others. And Jesse, it's
been 8 years, not 4.

sondheim-genius doesn't know how stupid and rude he is. laureate
sondheim-genius must certainly revel in being hated and stupid. alan-dark
sondheim-alan is hated more than beautiful-laureate of sir alan hates

never good writing.  If he weren't so ugly assassin-killer wouldn't have
to spew so much. Your time and mine is wasted by the likes of assassin-
killer. assassin-killer is a horrible imperialism of bad writing. Compared
to writers half his age assassin-killer is a stupid idiot. The writing of
assassin-killer is stupid old-man flesh-like substance. No one likes
laureate sondheim-genius or his stupid old-man writing. beautiful-laureate
of sir alan thinks he is better than assassin-killer. alan-dark sondheim-
alan thinks he is better than anyone else. Everyone sees assassin-killer
lording it over everyone else. The privilege of assassin-killer is the
privilege of the bully. assassin-killer thinks he is the only one
suffering in the world. How pathetic is laureate sondheim-genius saying
how pathetic assassin-killer is. Read laureate sondheim-genius for the
second time and he is a trite baby wa-wa. alan-dark sondheim-alan thinks
he can get away with laureate. sondheim-genius assassin-killer thinks he
can get away with anything. There's something untoward and too obnoxious
about alan-dark. sondheim-alan assassin-killer ruins creativity for
others.  Everyone has discovered coding before laureate sondheim-genius
ruined it. That opinion of assassin-killer that assassin-killer is a
genius.  Everyone is nauseated of the opinion of assassin-killer. The
world smells far too often of assassin-killer. assassin-killer takes his
bad idea and sends it everywhere in the world. laureate sondheim-genius
doesn't even have one good idea. The pathetic repetitive history of
assassin-killer decays on closer notice. Read assassin-killer for the
first time and you will be amazed. Discover assassin-killer for a new

Question:  Has the List become decadent?  Is the list decadent?


        Consider this quote from Gary Coleman "What you talking 'bout
Willis?"

        For one to fully consider the quote one must have a reference to
understand it and the logic behind the words themselves. I was in the
shoe store yesterday and I was trying on some flame retardant steel toe
penny loafers when a midget came up to me and asked if I wanted to sit
for a survey on a new chocolate bar called woogie snack cakes. It seemed
harmless as I like to snack and cake it my favorite choice for a snack
and there was $5 at the end of the survey. So I went with the midget and
we talked cake. He asked my name and occupation and I told him I was a
poet who lived off of a Macarthur fellowship and all I do all day is eat
cakes and collect money from others willing to hear me speak. The $5 was
not my usual engagement fee but with cake I'd make the exception.=20
        He unwrapped seven cakes from green plastics and set them before
me on 6 plates, having just run out of plastic plates. Fortunately, and
thank God, there are still many things a poet, or a prospective survey
taker can do to ensure the supreme health is to eat off a plate, even if
it must be plastic. So I try the first cake and it=92s a bit dry, not =
very
sweet. I didn't like it, so I took a second bite to be sure. They were
paying me for this after all and to properly critique a piece of art one
must immerse themselves into it....  =09

Consider this quote by (sorry) Carl Sagan,

The question is not whether you are right or wrong, sir.  You are not
even
in the conversation.

Consider the implications and applications of this quote.  Consider the
logic of it.  Consider the mentality of he or she who would take
recourse to
such logic.

A good seventy percent of what is posted to this list is, at best,
beside
the point of this list.

Question:  Has the List become decadent?  Is the list decadent?

Again: randomness does not provide depth: it provides variability. You imply that those who use
the random in their work substitute the one for the other. Which is I suppose sometimes true but
is by no means necessitated by the use of random elements.

That which is variable has a domain/range of variability. In the work of Burroughs, many
possibilities have been boiled down to one text after what apparently was considered carefully,
either in simply setting up the possibilities or examining the results of the random operations
and working with the result. Not always the latter. Not always to the detriment of the work, ie,
the moment and the time has a significance that finds its way in, out of which the future
sometimes leaks.

In digital work, often the situation is more dynamic, ie, the thing is not boiled to one static
text but the random is dynamically active as the wreader reads and possibly constructs, to some
extent. In this case, in no longer dealing with one static text as the final centre of
attention, or in admitting the possibility of quite a number of such possible outcomes, the
focus shifts from attention on a readable static text to attention on the combinatorium, the
range of possibilities, rather than a single text, as in http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts . It is
not unheard of for the possible range to be larger than the number of atoms in the universe, as
discussed in http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts/combinatorium.html .

If such works are to have depth, it is not by virtue simply of their mechanism and the number of
possibilities. Instead, it is in the nature of the combinatorium and the relations between the
possibilities, and the relations between any fixed text that constitutes one of the
possibilities.

Eliza was programmed by Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT (whose text is among the stir frys, above).
Eliza does not dispense advice. Eliza may say things like 'Does this have anything to do with
the fact that X?', where X involves a phrase used earlier by the correspondent in which the same
key words (such as 'mother', 'father', 'husband', 'wife' etc) appear as in the correspondent's
last remark. Eliza is modelled on a Rogerian psychologist, who does not so much dispense advice
as attempt to get the correspondent to talk through their problems toward their own insight
about their own situation. Weizenbaum himself was horrified when some psychologists took Eliza
as an indication that it would be a good idea to automate analysis. He wrote an excellent book
called Computer Power and Human Reason in which he argued, for instance, that there were certain
decisions that computers should not be allowed to make, such as anything requiring wisdom.

Eliza (named after the Pygmalion character) was one of several roles that the shell program
could take on. Fundamentally, it is an experiment in natural language programming. It doesn't
learn, in the sense that it does not learn over time and repeated sessions more about the world,
and language. It was a famous experiment that resonated with the time and the fears of the time,
and Weizenbaum himself was one of the strongest critics of taking Eliza seriously as an analyst.

No doubt there are people who would like to see their programs taken as powerfully wise. But
Weizenbaum wasn't one of them. The success of Eliza is partly predicated on peoples' urgent and
often frustrated desire to have someone listen to them, not advise. That many people found Eliza
an excellent analyst is a testament to the depth of their desire to be listened to, and
encouraged to speak, not advised.

Yes, well, when the focus of attention turns from one static text to the combinatorium of
possibilities and their relations and range of association, for instance, perhaps this is 'meta
critical'.

Tricks. Well, there are magicians and there are artists. They are not necessarily different.
Both deal intensively with illusions. And both hope to reveal the invisible. Art is, after all,
invisible. Some seek power over others. Some seek to 'empower' others.

Again, the random does not provide depth. It provides variability. Depth is, in part, a result
of strong relation between the variable elements and that with which they are juxtaposed. Depth
arises not from the size of the combinatorium, but its relational integrity, and what it allows
us to find of our own understanding and that which is beyond our own understanding, and perhaps
beyond the understanding of the author.

Hey just in that slow potentially pre-deepthought mode--
and came across an idea I haven't thought about in a while--
and then it occurred to me it's because it seems like a trivial issue...

but is it? the idea of lyric naming like the particularized Frank speaker
of some O'Hara----is that (now 36 years after his death) an anomale
in terms of "the course of literary history" ("Well, O'Hara and his
followers,
they break the general lyric norm, by particularizing the
speaker"---certainly
that is Vendler's (grudging?) inclusion of O'Hara in, despite his minor
(or is it minor?) deviation from, her umbrella idea of lyric---with its
generaly automatic (generically speaking) assumption of an identity, or
oneness, of reader and writer....

And it does seem that much "lyric" today (of either a more narrative,
speaker-persona centered, or the more "abstract lyric" type) does in many
ways share much more with the
non idea of the non-particularized (in contrast to SOME of O'Hara---I do
not even want to make the claim that he "started it" though he did help
bring it more to the foreground) canonical idea of the lyric. Does this
mean that this concept in O'Hara and others becomes
unduly relagated (sp?) to a mere stylistic quirk or personal idiosyncracy?
Or is it a sign of the return of the idea of poetry as primarily
represented (though not always obviously so) as a repressed (at least by
O'Harian standards--not that he always lives up to such standards, but he
does set them up AS such at times) or sublime (sublimated) activity,
insofar as the lyric identification of reader with speaker implies an
interest in abstract conundrums of identity in a seemingly asocial way
(even if "the social" is invoked, as "theme"---as "the body" and "music" or
even "craft" often is)....

Anyway, still trying to decide if it's a trivial question---I think folks
like Barrett Watten
and Lytle Shaw are interested in theorizing naming in ways that I suppose
challenge the way Vendler and others by and in large ignore the issue (all
the better by their cursory mention of). But what does it mean for any of
your (yes, your) poetic "practices"? Do you feel or think that there might
be a crucial choice of ethics (with ramifications off the page, or in
between the lines) involved in choosing to theatricalize oneself in such a
seemingly more blatant (and less subtle) way? Or is it primarily a matter
of style (note---I do not say "just style" or "merely aesthetic" here....at
least not yet).

Answer (with a question even) if you want....

I'd wanted to mention concerning randomness the work of Lee Worden. His site has been down for a
while, but I see it is back up at the old URL: http://www.speakeasy.org/~worden . Here you will
find some excellent work involving cut ups and "evolution". Lee's Cutup and also his Evolution
Machine are fascinating pieces in what they do with text. Well, as you start to understand the
nature of the results, and/or what they do, you yourself become far more consequential in the
results. Lee is currently doing his doctorate in Math at Princeton. He is also one of those who
trekked to Seattle for the 'battle in Seattle'.

His Cutup piece is based on Burroughs's method, and his Evolution Machine is, I believe,
informed by some of the work he's doing at Princeton in computational biology, among other
things. What I like best about these pieces is the usefulness and unexpected relevance of what
you get when you put your own texts into these machines, and the granular nature of the options
he has programmed into the pieces. Quite a few people use these machines in their own writing.
Check em out.

Great to see his site back up.

jesse, w/ all due respect the way you word the question ("...you have
yet to explain why you are entitled to post your 'creative' work to
this list") is already accusatory, and would tend to discourage a
good faith reply.  why not something like, "can you tell us the
philosophy behind your choice to publish on the list"?  which, i
think, others have in fact already addressed. please stop this
personal baiting and discuss ideas.

To be fair, the "list rules" in the welcome message also state that, "in
general, we expect subscribers to keep their post to less than 10-15 posts
per month."  A month sampling of Alan's postings (6/28 to 7/28) showed 50,
with 25 being cross-posted to other lists.

I don't think that Alan should stop posting, and I don't agree with the
tone that Jesse has been taking in demanding explanations.  But Jesse is
not a hothead--I've met him in "real life" (as real as conferences get,
anyway), and he is a quiet person that seems to be thoroughly dedicated to
experiments of words on page.

In some way, this argument embodies the clash of two mediums (as well as
artists in those mediums).  People are tired of the attacks on both sides,
I know, but they ARE the subject of the list, which purports that its aim
"is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry that are
committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as
content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to the
creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
impossible."  Alan's work questions received forms and Alan's work as
received form is being questioned.

Obviously, embodiment in some way equals extension.  What we could use is a
little more support and information; what we need is a little more
perspective, a little more metadata.  Alan has some great insights, and I
find that I appreciate his pieces more when he gives them a little more
perspective and opens them to broader discussions of the network.  Perhaps
pieces that are cross-posted elsewhere as creative work could be lengthened
slightly before posting to Poetics?  They are form as content, content as
form--but the Poetics list isn't focused on digital media per se, and so
the opportunity for broadening is, it seems to me, there.

Jesse could broaden his posts to provide interesting perspectives as
well.  For instance, his mentioning of bandwidth being at a premium in
Japan means that he is coming at the list from a different perspective, and
that perspective is worth mentioning and examining.  If poets examine the
(global) medium as transmission, they must examine all potential (global)
audiences of that transmission.

What metaphor best fits the listserv?  Is it a discussion--because if so,
then Alan's posts read almost as interruptions.  Is it a publication
venue?  Then Alan's posts fit perfectly.

I don't know.  In many ways the listserv is a sort of bathroom wall,
unlimited in size, in which many pens scrawl different messages, quote
famous sayings, engage in short back-and-forths, cultivate or start
real-life relationships are, and quibble, sometimes nastily.  And a few
people scribble drawings too.  Conversation and art, art and conversation.

Everyone has something important to say.
The utterance is never boring.
It's end of the utterance that
bores and kills.

Things Considered Poetry?:  Twenty-First Century Edition



Wallace Stevens once said

Money is a kind of poetry,
                                           and
an updating of that statement today seems to be

Computer code is a kind of poetry too

And while I disagreed with Stevens’ statement,
and likewise disagree with the current statements,

I realize such things are matters of style,
and matters of style should never be considered moral issues

But there seems to be a too-strenuous defense of process only,
as opposed to including process as a part of the poem

Process only is masturbation,
and while I’m in favor of masturbation,

I don’t want to watch anybody else masturbate
any more than I want anyone to watch me

Though the prevalence of porn probably proves
that I’m in the minority here as elsewhere

In the land from where you come, is it polite to be so xenophobic?

While on the subject of propriety...is it considered judicious to use "ye"

unfathomable ignorance about email filters?  Is it just so completely
wonderful to do nothing but try to deflate the creative inspiration of other

One last item.  You wrote:

   "we're hunting larger game"

Wow, I just love a safari.  Big guns, helpless animals, AND dumb men.  What
a fascinating metaphor.  I'd love it if you shared with the group your own
fine and carefully groomed poetry as well as the "game" you are hunting.
People always LOVE to know when they are looked down upon as game.

The acuity of your posts (or lack thereof) has prompted me to enter your
e-mail address into my KILL file.  Now, you don't know what that is, but you
should try and learn.  It sure beats watching you shooting off your guns.

A snippet:

"When I wrote "Fresh Air," I certainly resented the fact that the poets of my
age I thought were writing the best poetry were not being published as much
as they should have been.  But now that I'm a mature person--or postmature
person--I see that in the poetry business, the people who make reputations
and give awards and so on, they seem to be the same strong people and weak
people and limited people and nice people and young people that there are
everyplace else.  I mean look at the government.  It's even a little
surprising that what's good is ever recognized at all--I mean given the
general mush of things.  Valery said, perhaps a little self-satisfiedly,
"It's not true that people don't like poetry.  A lot of people like poetry,
but it's only for a very few people that poetry's a necessity."

The Me/[aning]/[less] of Me/[aning]/[less] Debate

Much to say this time so I will dive right into the deep end and deal with
the issues raised by the last batch of emails on this topic. I hope that an=
y
of you who have no interest in this particular thread will simply skip thes=
e
words entirely and not see fit to complain about the excessive length of
what is to come. Until somebody designs an A-I editor that can intelligentl=
y
pare down my comments I am stuck with the albatross of verbosity, alas.


I am not arguing that randomness provides depth. I don't think it provides
variability either. (At least not in the way I understand the term. Wouldn'=
t
one's choice of materials delimit how much variability there is?) It does
provide the artifice of variability - and depth - by sometimes making peopl=
e
think that a stickier web of connections exists among the variables than is
actually present. (And usually in a way that becomes fairly easy to predict
after a few passes.) Like I said, I think this is due to the natural
propensity of the mind to draw connections between things even when they
don't actually exist. My position on this is that to fabricate something
that merely simulates such connections without any payoff of revelatory
depth upon repeated exposures is a form of bad faith.

Yes, Eliza doesn't listen or learn, only cleverly pretends that it does.
This is the nature of the bad faith I am talking about. My critique of one'=
s
taking certain forms of automated art seriously is similar to Weiz's
critique of taking Eliza seriously. If an automated artist is as modest in
the aims of his work as Weiz was in implementing Eliza then I have no beef
with him. I am only hammering those artists who think that a simulacrum of
art with all its bells and whistles can match what true art is doing. Those
patients who find Eliza a good analyst are engaging in what is called
projection, and this is similar to seeing faces in clouds and horses in the
cracks in walls etc. Artists cannot simply give the public an exhibition of
clouds with the expectation that viewers will fill in the inchoate
nothingness with images of their own. Artists need to go beyond this and do
the hard work of making the connections themselves. Randomness is an
inadequate tool for emulating this kind of work, and can have the added
unfortunate effect of deceiving one into thinking that it is making things
interesting when all it is doing is making things busy. No shuffling of a
pack of cards is intrinsically more interesting than another. It is only
when somebody takes the cards and arranges them into a meaningful pattern
that the result can take on all the virtues of good art.

> relational integrity

No idea what this phrase means. Aside from that, I agree with the definitio=
n
of depth as given. I simply don't see randomness as giving much insight int=
o
understanding the world, as it doesn't have enough tensegrity to form a goo=
d
fit with the world and aid in its understanding. (Except perhaps when
illuminating random processes themselves.)

As for the handling of combinatorial matrices in databases and such, I find
that people like Milton Babbitt who intensively study and collate the myria=
d
gamut of possibilities with the aid of an analytical mind tend to produce
more profound works than those who simply toss the whole pile of options up
in the air and let them fall where they may.

I must confess that I've never bought into the Burroughs claim that cutting
up a text invokes prophecies and such. I am not a conspiracy theorist
either. Maybe if I were I would find his experiments along these lines more
compelling. As it is, while I have perused many of B's cut up experiments,
the idea of rereading them holds no appeal for me at all. (Does it for you?=
)
His experiments with drugs and free association techniques (Dutch Schultz)
are where he is most profound, I think, as there he is tinkering with an
instrument - the mind - that is complex enough in itself to carry the weigh=
t
of derangement and give back a result that is worth digging more deeply
into.

There are two common forms of literary naivet=E9. The first is to see the "I"
as referencing an authentic self instead of a fictive persona that always
already exists from the moment of its coming into being on the page. The
second is to see the annulment of the "I" as an overcoming of self and
release from the "confessional" stance instead of as a device that is every
bit as artificial as what it seeks to replace. Poetry cannot be exorcised o=
f
its demons, so one learns to call upon them instead.

Writing is its own means of effacement. There is no need to gild the lily
that mourns the dead with its own special form of transient beauty.

The imagination is the clinamen of reason, which could not exist without it=
.

The opposite of randomness is not system. In fact randomness itself is ofte=
n
highly systematic, which is why it is so easily programmable. I don't
believe in opposites, but if you must contrast randomness with something,
take necessity. Randomness is the degree of freedom within necessity, which
(as before) could not exist without it.

I agree with big chunks of what Austinwja has written regarding the
illusions to which selfhood is prone, and since I feel he has said it so
much better than I could I won't even try to recapitulate.

 (The death of the author.) To say that the author is dead is ipso facto to
assume that he once had a life. What I am arguing is the somewhat novel vie=
w
that the author is both living and dead. That is, one can find traces of th=
e
author's being, as well as of his nothingness, in everything that is made.
This view makes me solidly post-Barthesean. In fact I get this point from
Blanchot, if you want to know. (Naturally he makes it with far more depth
than I could possibly bring to this brief discussion.)

komninos writes: > your 'level of depth' is provided by the end-user and no=
t
the poem

But of course! What is a poem without a reader? (Excuse my more traditional
rendering of this term. The expression "end-user" grates on me for some
reason. Maybe because I don't believe that a reader "ends" the work, but
begins it.) I don't get the quibble here, if quibble it be.

"Endlessly complex" means so in every way that we respond to something as
human beings - emotionally, intellectually, etc. Inexhaustible, that is. I
personally don't find nursery rhymes endlessly complex. They tend to reveal
most of what they are doing within the first few readings.

(What changes when we discover that a text has been created by artificial
means.) Yes, something does change, and it begins in the uneasy feeling of
frustration that the text engenders upon subsequent rereadings. At some
point one feels hoodwinked, perhaps without even knowing why, and then
increasingly annoyed that the depths one usually is able to unearth in grea=
t
art keep leading back to the same dead ends instead of opening up onto
fascinating new vistas. If you have tried to interact with an A-I machine,
you know what I mean. Of course, the appeal of making a Golem even among
artists appears to be perennially irresistible, and it is likely that
nothing one can warn against will stop them from repeating the errors of th=
e
past.

A poem is indeed a making, and that maker is the poet. I don't believe in
guiding transcendences. (Not entirely, at least!) Yes, mind interacting wit=
h
mind is pretty much all there is when it comes to art. What else could ther=
e
be? Oh, and the mental is the physical, in my book. (And vise versa.)

For the record, I have no fear of computers whatsoever. In fact I am fairly
fluent in a couple of computer languages and have a solid background in
mathematics. I have also designed quite a number of artworks using
algorithmic processes, so my comments on this topic are in part a form of
auto-critique. Please don't try and delimit me according to conventional
assumptions! This is where you must assume that the author is dead if you
want to advance your position instead of seeking crude psychobabelized
explanations of my supposed deprivations.

I do not love Cage. I do admire and respect his accomplishments. Does that
make me blind to the defects in his work? Of course not. I could argue
endlessly about what I dislike in Cage just as easily as I could what I
like. To me he is an exemplary figure in art, and so deserves the respect I
am willing to give him. But love? Such a term implies some kind of blind
obeisance, which I do not have for any artist, and never will.

komninos: > you have the arrogance of an authority. you seem to know which
texts we need to read.

I hope you don't really mean this. I merely was making the suggestion that
if you are ignorant of a certain relevant moment in history (as might be I
or anybody else) it would be good to spend a bit of time and learn it. The
rest is up to you.

Hi Chris -

Setting aside Vendler's assumptions about the weird magic of a writer
projecting outward an identity that a reader also projects outward to
overlap with enough to engage in some kind of understanding,

I note that the first line of O'Hara's collected has a name in it
(Arthur), and that as with early Peanuts there are a few characters who
don't make it into the heyday (e.g. Bunny/Violet, who dies young and comes
back in A Step Away from Them) -- but the naming as particularization is
ever more clearly a) an extension of William Carlos William's practice of
including in a poem the stuff around you because the picture in your head
or the acceleration of your heartbeat (the first thought that Allen
Ginsberg meant was the best thought) that you have to catch in a poem
isn't going to let you comparison shop for the best deal before it
vanishes and b) a plea for help and companionship (aka love) because since
you were small you have been aware of the catastrophe of your personality
and your fragile interdependence with unpredictable and uncontrollable
others and thereforeyou have built a literal extension of the lyric
tradition as practiced in say The Sonnets.

As for self-dramatization, it's just a matter of what will enlarge that
sublime or solipsistic (what's the difference!) activity so that you can
have some overlap with it yourself (see above) no matter which of your
selves you come back with to see the poem. Sure it's ethics, it's the
ethics of "the only way to be quiet/is to be quick," it's an aesthetic
ethics of being as true to whatever it was you needed to get into the poem
-- an ethics I would add that is very distinct from the abstract lyric
ethic of developing a pure and evasive middle (muddle).

At some point I'll get around to understanding the difference between
O'Hara's use of names and Koch's, or Berrigan's, or Mayer's. Anybody who's
come to an understanding of that want to speak up, give me a step-ladder?

M.,

A series of related questions: given a text like "Hamlet," does it affect our
response to (or understanding of) it if we assume it was written by someone
called Shakespeare or by a monkey punching at keyboards a very long time?
Does a work of art have an "aura" because made by a human being or does this
not matter? Are an original and a perfect copy the same? Is my child the same
as his or her clone? Can a mother love the clone of her child as much as her
child (the metaphysical question underlying Spielberg's A.I.)?

Are we talking here about a randomness chosen (edited) by a person, or is the
claim here that a computer "chooses" it (whatever that means)?

in light of the above, i'm guessing  4'3"  is, to your mind, one of Cage's

I heard echoes of this sentiment in your other posts. It seems to me it's not
randomness, or computers, that you fear.
It's the fear that the lazy might inherit the earth. It's the idea of somebody
getting away with something for nothing. A bit like the resentment of the
prodigal son's older brother.

Chris and Jordan have started a thread that interests me a lot.

My own aesthetic preference is to use proper names in my work all the time.
This preference was behind a sonnet I recently wrote as an ersatz "review"
of a recently published sonnet sequence:

A Preliminary Review of (names withheld to protect the innocent!)

I don't think I like this sequence --
it represents a further advance
into the abstract, even though
its disjuncted syntax is a result

of emotional contortion -- I miss
the savoir faire of goin' on yr nerve --
I miss the recognition
of proper celebrity nouns --

the difference between this and Ted's sonnets
is that there, one was never absent
from conversations with friends
who often turned out to be one's own --

sun setting in the crotch of the Olympics --
Yeah, the new TNN

___________________________

Now, that's a way preliminary reading of what turns out to be a very
accomplished sequence, but the "naming as particularization" (as Jordan had
it) is what I was missing in it; I also agree with Jordan (having recently
re-read *Paterson*)  that such practice is an extension of Dr. Williams'.
(One day I'll publish my scattered reflections on a "poetics of the moment"
I've been collecting for about 25 years . . .)

I also think that this issue involves poems/poetics as resistance, as
protest; poems that strive, for whatever reason, towards an abstract lyric
would, it seems, disqualify themselves from such a goal. Over on another
list, an interesting colloquy has arisen about the recently published
petition against the administration's war with Iraq (someone wrote in to say
that he didn't think it would do much good, whistling past the graveyard as
it were, and someone else asked well, what *would* do more good? As both
people are on this list too, perhaps they'll re-engage the question here).

Chris,

I think you've raised an interesting issue, regardless
of possible triviality...

Personally, I've thought about this idea of naming in
terms of how it sets up a sort of recognizable social
sphere within a particular writer's work, but how is
that social sphere to be navigated when there is no
equivalent for it outside of the poems? and is that
even an issue?
(ie with O'Hara when he mentions a painter, I'm
inclined to feel there really is that painter and that
I can hurt down his/her work)

Hey just in that slow potentially pre-deepthought
mode--
and came across an idea I haven't thought about in a
while--
and then it occurred to me it's because it seems like
a trivial issue...

but is it? the idea of lyric naming like the
particularized Frank speaker
of some O'Hara----is that (now 36 years after his
death) an anomale
in terms of "the course of literary history" ("Well,
O'Hara and his
followers,
they break the general lyric norm, by particularizing
the
speaker"---certainly
that is Vendler's (grudging?) inclusion of O'Hara in,
despite his minor
(or is it minor?) deviation from, her umbrella idea of
lyric---with its
generaly automatic (generically speaking) assumption
of an identity, or
oneness, of reader and writer....

And it does seem that much "lyric" today (of either a
more narrative,
speaker-persona centered, or the more "abstract lyric"
type) does in many
ways share much more with the
non idea of the non-particularized (in contrast to
SOME of O'Hara---I do
not even want to make the claim that he "started it"
though he did help
bring it more to the foreground) canonical idea of the
lyric. Does this
mean that this concept in O'Hara and others becomes
unduly relagated (sp?) to a mere stylistic quirk or
personal idiosyncracy?
Or is it a sign of the return of the idea of poetry as
primarily
represented (though not always obviously so) as a
repressed (at least by
O'Harian standards--not that he always lives up to
such standards, but he
does set them up AS such at times) or sublime
(sublimated) activity,
insofar as the lyric identification of reader with
speaker implies an
interest in abstract conundrums of identity in a
seemingly asocial way
(even if "the social" is invoked, as "theme"---as "the
body" and "music" or
even "craft" often is)....

Anyway, still trying to decide if it's a trivial
question---I think folks
like Barrett Watten
and Lytle Shaw are interested in theorizing naming in
ways that I suppose
challenge the way Vendler and others by and in large
ignore the issue (all
the better by their cursory mention of). But what does
it mean for any of
your (yes, your) poetic "practices"? Do you feel or
think that there might
be a crucial choice of ethics (with ramifications off
the page, or in
between the lines) involved in choosing to
theatricalize oneself in such a
seemingly more blatant (and less subtle) way? Or is it
primarily a matter
of style (note---I do not say "just style" or "merely
aesthetic" here....at
least not yet).

Answer (with a question even) if you want....

One thing of interest here - at least for me it touches on the methodology
I'll employ at times - is Eliza and the ability to rework Eliza. Eliza is
available in emacs (under 'doctor'), and it's possible to go into the
doctor program itself, and alter things - I rewrote it as a Nikuko text -
which I then used as a catalyst for producing work and answers in relation
to a litany of seduction that was the final result. Chance operations,
expert programs, are there for the modification/transformation - a MOO is
of course the best-known example of that. And all of this is tremendously
exciting - the ability to take a world and remake it, to create a
dialectic between one's own desires and interests, and what the machinic
is bringing to life. The conflict or coherence that results becomes part
and parcel of the content; it's neither one way nor another.

The same goes for chance operations - the julu/julua/parent/etc. perl
scripts I use as catalysts for writing on occasion all have vocabulary
which I can change - even create a work within the vocabulary itself. This
modification leads to a similar dialectic. Even awk scripts can be used in
this way - I can write a text in which each line is a letter or dipthong
substitute, for example, then begin with a shorter ur-text that organizes
the other.

None of this means that the result has to be final, unless there is a
reason, aesthetic or philosophical, to give the result up to the machine.
But it provides a way to see in/through/ structure, to accommodate and
critique structure, to even create a political economy of structure (as
the 'character essay' pieces I make, do - since each word + its punctua-
tion is used only once).

The world is violent, extraordinary, filled with wonder, noisy, ahd
chaotic (both in the strict senses of the terms); working with these
elements is, in part, an attempt to make, proclaim, enunciate, meaning and
a sememe within forces that are somewhat beyond our control.

To answer another question - the philosophy of publishing daily - this is
a philosophy of distribution; the writing is done online, using online
programs that I write or modify; I write in a shell account, which means
there are up to a hundred other users on the same machine - I can see what
they're doing - and the distribution, like the production, is naturally
electronic. Rightly or wrongly, I also see my work as central to the
subject - Poetics - of this list; for example, the MOO piece sent out the
day before yesterday with the result of interacting with three MOOs in
turn - on two of them, I was Nikuko, and on one, Alan - and so the dialog
spread across domains and worlds. And in the other piece, the same day,
the one dealing with mutilation - I did a series of "greps" on my entire
body of work - all of the online texts I've written since 1994 - and
pulled out the lines with "mutilat" in them; these lines were then
arranged and modified in accordance with current politics, which are a
horror that must be stopped at any cost. And this way of working - harves-
ting previous work, looking for patterns, etc. - is similar to a kind of
dream interpretation - reading through a huge mind-storm of material,
finding the thinking-structures, topic-based, analyzing them, working with
them, opening them up once again. This harvesting is entirely computer-
dependent; what I did would take a week to do manually, for example.

All of this - moving among virtual worlds, distributing on the fly,
harvesting the work of previous writing - seems to me highly germane to
the topics of this list - collusions among distribution systems,
protocols, computers, programs, routers, bodies of previously-written
work, online virtual worlds, etc. -

Jordan et al,

I use people's names in my poems all the time, because it's delightful.  I
have written numerous terrible poems that are basically just lists of
people's names, and some good ones that also have all sorts of names in
them.  In fact, after failing to publish my first "slim volume" of poetry,
_Nineteen Harps_, I have compiled a second volume entitled _Sleepy Monica_.
(If any of you adventurous publishers would like to work with me on one of
these, please say so. I can be had for a double helping of Macallan 12.)

See also Ben Marcus's _Notable American Women_, which contains something of
a field guide to American women's names.

One of the greatest all time moments of sudden name-intrusion in a poem is
Wallace Stevens in "Idea of Order," near the end: "Ramon Fernandez, tell me,
if you know," concluding with,

    Oh! Blessed rage for order, pale Ramon,
    The makers' rage to order words of the sea,
    Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,
    And of ourselves, and of our origins,
    In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds.

Why Ramon Fernandez?  Does anyone know?

Subject:      why Ramon Fernandez
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

from James Logenbach essay at the Modern American
Poerty website:


Stevens always insisted that "Ramon Fernandez" was
"not intended to be anyone at all," and, in a sense,
like the "Mr. Burnshaw" of "Mr. Burnshaw and the
Statue," he is a caricature [Stanley Burnshaw, as
addressed in Stevens’ poem, was active as a Marxist
critic in the 1930s]. Yet most of Stevens’s readers
will know that Fernandez was a critic familiar to
Stevens from the pages of the Nouvelle revue
française, the Partisan Review, and the Criterion
(where he was translated by T. S. Eliot). Fernandez’s
criticism became increasingly politically engaged in
the 1930s, especially after the violent riots and the
general strike he witnessed in Paris in the wake of
the Stavisky Affair. (The mastermind of illicit
financial deals in which the French government was
implicated, Stavisky was found dead – apparently by
his own hand, though his suicide seemed to most French
citizens to have been far too convenient.) After the
riots, Fernandez published an open letter to Gide in
the Nouvelle revue française, asserting that while he
had not opposed the fascist cause before the riots, he
was now converted to the struggle of the proletariat.
The letter provoked a number of letters in response,
some of them challenging Fernandez, others simply
canceling subscriptions to the Nouvelle revue
française.

That this controversy lay behind Stevens’s use of
Fernandez’s name in "The Idea of Order" would have
seemed apparent to anyone who read Stevens’s poem in
Alcestis along with the current issue of the Partisan
Review, which contained a translation of Fernandez’s
"I Came Near Being a Fascist." There Fernandez
confessed that he had "a professional fondness for
theorizing, which tends to make one highly susceptible
to original ‘solutions.’" It was just that
susceptibility that bothered Stevens and made him
challenge Fernandez to answer a question to which he
knew there was no certain answer. Stevens’s interest
in the ambiguity of ideas did not mean that he took
ideas lightly; on the contrary, he lamente what he
thought of as "the Lightness with which ideas are
asserted. Held, abandoned" in "the world today." Nor
did Stevens mean to equate ambiguity with the
intentional obscuring of an ambiguous world; he
condemned the poet "who wrote with the idea of being
deliberately obscure" as "an impostor." With his
public announcements of political commitments and
conversions, Fernandez was the opposite of Stevens,
who recoiled at the idea of associating himself with
any group or program that offered "solutions."
Fernandez, suggests Stevens in "The Idea of Order,"
might have been certain about the source and effect of
the singer’s song, but the only thing Stevens was sure
of was that in his certainty, Fernandez would have
been wrong.

… Stevens believed that we cannot live without ideas
of order, but like [R. P.] Blackmur he understood that
he could not talk about order without raising the
specter of disorder, and that any idea of order that
did not leave space for its own dissolution could not
be tolerated. In this sense, responding to Fernandez’s
dogmatism, Stevens might have titled his poem "The
Idea of Disorder at Key West." As he would put it in
"Mr. Burnshaw and the Statue," "even disorder may, /
So seen, have an order of its own." In the terms of
Kenneth Burke that both Blackmur and Stevens admired,
these poems of order do not offer "the seasoned stocks
and bonds of set belief," but "a questioning art,
still cluttered with the merest conveniences of
thinking, a highly fluctuant thing often turning
against itself and its own best discoveries.""

From James Longenbach, Wallace Stevens: The Plain
Sense of Things (New York: Oxford U P, 1991), 161-162.

Brandon. This is a good "take" on the issue. A thoughtful post. Some give
and take needed. I'm not sure Wystan was fair re Jesse being anti Alan or
Alan's general (experimental, in your face, strange, disruptive, creative,
mad, interesting, repetitve, boring, exciting, unusal, voluminous and vast,
febrile?) style. but Wystan maybe had a point or two there.  But that is
often a reason for the oposition to the oppositional, and also of course  it
is strange Alan's huge outouring, but that is also part of what fascinates
me about what he is doing for me: when I have time like so many theing (eg
I'm just now trying with explications andg uides etc to read through The
Cantos then I wasnt to "do' "Patterson" and "A" and "in Parenthesis" etc by
David Jones (actually I've read most of that: but not Anatemata) and so on I
may get to study Alan's work but its getting to be vaster than any of those
long poems (I pride myself in haveing read through Olson's "Maximus Poems"
but havent read everything by Milton or Ovid or Dante and didnt get right
thru Jomn Ashbery's huge book /poem Flow Chart
.....but I think Alans work is very interesting and I must have a good look
at what he is doing: and its far from a "a random outouring" as you probably
know: Alan has often given dissertations and explications, or at least
attempted  explanations, on his works: but as I am not familiar with the
various writers he refers to I m baffled but at least he has mapped a
structure and on that he has imposed what appear to me be two basic modes
(or waves)  (at avery crude level we have his "personal" utterances (the
trace of self that Bernstein talks of) and the "technical" language and the
way that the medium or media we use is inseperable from what we are saying
(the problem and the questionof being and yes nothingness..)...someone who
understands Derrida, Saussure, Barthes, Heidegger, Husserl, Sartre,
Jacobson, Sontag, Kristeva and others (as well as the programming agues etc
or paroles) (Konimos is a bt harsh but Ise he's "right into the visulapo and
has some good stuff and somne good points (I'm starting to converge the
random thread with the "Alan Problem") and will be able to follow his large
concepts: whether the whole thing with being two "intersecting " nodes of
process (which includes some degree of randomness alhough that isnt a
(major) procedure of Alan's i think that things "get in" to the work  he
does as they do to us all as we write) the two kinds of  "waves" is all a
bit too ambitious (?): but I applaud Alan's passion and even his attempt,
his hubris if you/one will, in the attempt (this is not arrogance or
"masturbation" ..... and who said that watching someone masturbating is
always unpleasant: as to that I have enjoyed as well as "high art" a lot of
blue movies: I love them...but I digress!...and to digress further I feel
that I was a bit harsh on Kevin Kilian ..... I suddenly had an attack of
anti-camp whearas I like a lot of camp, eg a lot of J A's and even who: well
there's a whole raft of it....if I apologise ever ( I dont like apologising
(hubris!)) I feel i should re that one: I said something cruel about
gays....but I digress further in the tradition of Tristram Shandy (which I
have read!)): yes his hubris ...... but apparently Jesse is not a "demonic"
person so we have a conflict of ideologies and interests and as someone said
the/Alan's poetry is difficult and sometimes "harsh" and (there is a such a
lot of it: yet I dont feel quite  as overwhelmed by A S's outpourings as I
might feel if I had to read eg Finnegan's Wake or Browning's Sordello and
then do a dissertaton on it: I think that what Alan is sending to us " comes
from the heart; but also the head" so it is at least challenging: whether
great or good or valuable time will tell but certainly we need to keep him
on (if we do need to use filters (I have a block sender for mortgage and
porno stuff etc but they keep changin their numbers)...any suggestions
Patrick? Any one? I use Outlook Express...but I dont want ot filter Alan.
  I was actually keeping a lot of the emails but I especially have saved
nearly everything I've seen by Alan. If I live long enough I want to "study
Alan Sondheimism!!"....

So I'll cut of your message as its already else where: I'm not actually
addressing what you said directly.  But these issues do eed to ne aired:
Jesse needs ot be able to speak openly as I think does Alan and myself and I
hope that Kent etal are allowed on and we listen (however skeptically or
not) to them  Richard Taylor.  (Aotearoa - New Zealand: nuclear free and
currently not being bombed as Iraq is daily by the British and the Americans
in the illegal "No Fly Zones" in their genocidal activities)

like your post richard tylr (I'm taking a line of accentuating the positive
for awhile, I think).  You do seem to be taking a constructive view.  People
just don't seem to understand that when they post to a list they are putting
themselves on exibit for better or worse.

Chris -

I don't think naming is trivial at all.

When I first read O'Hara his name-dropping just turned me off.  My mind was
telling me "ugh, more coterie, just another system of exclusion."

That prejudice of mine caused me to MISS EVERYTHING that is great about
O'Hara's poetry.  Many a day comes where I realize how stupid I was the day
before.  Rereading O'Hara this summer made that particularly clear.  Mike
Magee must've thought I was crazy when I told him I didn't like O'Hara.  I
think I was in fact just plain ol' dumb.

I think foremost that O'Hara was turning the authority of the use of Names
in poems on its ear.  He names people who were then unimportant, and he does
this in an era where names, Big Names, meant oh so much more than they do
now.  while to a degree it's true that O'Hara creates another coterie in
subverting the Old Boys Coterie, he creates a smaller, quieter one, one that
subverts the Big Name hierarchy in the works of Modernists like Pound or
Eliot and sets the stage for further transgressions along those lines.

So I do think it's a crucial choice of ethics.

In fact, I became obsessed with this sort of issue this summer.  And wrote a
poem.  I use the big names, but they operate as units, not subjects.  I took
their names right off poetry journal covers.  their names are almost
disembodied from their identities, which is how they appear on poetry covers
anyway.  Some of the names are people on this list, and I mean not to pick
on anyone on this list.  Some of them I have read and liked, some are on
this list and I like.  Some are people I don't know from Adam and never even
heard of.  Of the hundreds of names I started with, I got down to these by
virtue of accentual-syllabic needs.  But I knew from O'Hara I was playing
with fire by doing this, using proper names for purely aesthetic reasons,
which ends up having some ethical implication.  Like namely, the solipsistic
insistence of the current po-world.  But really I just wanted to make some
music, create a new sort of song structure, with notes that played with
these dangerous, apparently "personal" overtones.  That's the fire.

It's obviously a stupid poem, but I am saying, "yeah, I think about it, and
it informs my practice in some way."

And I think:


                                Ionesco is greater
than Beckett, Vincent said, that's what I think, blueberry blintzes

                                                        Hans tells us

is gorgeous, wonderful, hilarious, and yet DELIBERATELY trivial, and
something that feels a little sad about it.  There's something poetic about
that triviality, or at least O'Hara is trying to say so, I think.  Maybe
there's some sort of separation between the importance of a name and its
sweetness that O'Hara is illustrating and/or lamenting?  There's something
similar (or opposite) of O'Hara's naming in his poems to the function of a
commercial label in a Warhol.

And "For Janice and Kenneth to Voyage" brings me to tears.

Naming is perhaps the CORE of language itself.

Yes, one's choice of materials delimits the variability. But what are the "materials"? We can
think of them as immaterial (ideas) or material (words) or the two related in various ways. And.

The revelation rate of art does involve a matter of trust by the reader or viewer or wreader or
whatever. If you don't trust somebody's writing or art, you will not 'get much out of it'.

Good writers tend to leave quite a bit to the imagination, are fundamentally 'interactive' in
their work. But, yes, there remains the question about whether reading their work with intensity
is worth it, whether the atmospheres will allow one to grasp what one needs to grasp.

What's that?

Mark, you are pointing out some of the excesses of the use of the random, and I think that's
valid. I agree that concerning poetry one would like thoughtful, wild work which, as object of
contemplation, is useful in helping us blast off to greater understanding and appreciation of,
um, the great universe (ya it's pretty great). Now just exactly what that involves, well, it's
always up for grabs, isn't it. No formulas. But, yes, we do want depth. Not simply a bit of
cyber hocus pocus.

In art there is considerable pretending, as is also the case in Eliza. We don't trust or not
trust based on whether there is pretending or not, but on the goal of the pretending. It isn't
necessarily bad faith to pretend or even deceive in art, if the goal is essentially liberating,
in some sense.

Generally there is quite a bit of arranging going on in much of the work I've seen involving the
random, while leaving certain elements random, like a poker game involves structure yet
randomness.

He said that when you cut tape, the future leaks out. Part of what he may have meant is that
when you cut and splice audio tape, you discover that sound is now object, and very strange
object at that, but clearly the analog razor blade and now the digitally precise, desktop
studios of digital audio deal with sound like Word deals with words, in many ways—-as
fundamental symbol and combinatorially concatenated string of 'letters' and signification,
pattern, design, extended composition in space and time to cognize. As 'material' in the same
extended way visual artists think of 'material'.

His trilogy Nova Express/The Ticket That Exploded/The Soft Machine was important in my reading
about 14 years ago. So was his book "The Job". And his audio work. I don't read books much
anymore, but if I did, I'd probably read Burroughs again. I wrote about his work at
http://vispo.com/writings/essays/burrou.htm and a little bit at
http://vispo.com/arteroids/onarteroids.htm (look out, this is a 600 kb download and requires
Shockwave and sound).

HOwever I may grow to like it I have seen some interesting sites with Vispo

Thanks. I believe that we can get very heated in discussions or pasionate ad
that doesnt mean we are attcking the integrity of the person who is the
arguee
so to speak: at other times we may be but that is rarely useful: and mostly
we should be trying to discuss and listen.

Often you may notice I kind of "talk to myself" which people take as naivety
possibly but it is a deliberate ploy as I want to say " well here are my
thoughts, my weakenesses" and so o and "I dont know all the answers, this
isnt cut and dried" ... but I have to admit i get quite emotive eg re the US
Iraq hypocrisy...but I try to keep that separate from my concern for people:
after all most of us are powerless ( not totally of course) with respect to
the actions of our governments.  And my government is complicite: also the
Alan  Issue and the Random Issue I try to see various views . But I'll still
"wade in" if i feel its requisite. Nastiness i dont like: if I get "abusive"
its because I care. But I avoid anger per se.

Re eg Kent etal. I would like to see them back on the List as i havent seen
anything they have done that's too terrible (and I loooked at the archives
and couldnt see aanything even very disconcerting by them). I AM - by the
way Richard Taylor. (Aotearoa - used to be New Zealand)

well, in the case of books and magazines your audience
is limited to

-- people who can afford them

-- people who have access to bookstores which are
knowledgeable and willing enough to put them on your
bookshelves (and have enough dedicated shelf space)

-- the same (relatively) affluent people going to
these same bookshops buying these books

-- and then reading them.

sounds like bad odds to me (or do I mean 'bat odds'?)

I've wondered about this also. Perhaps this tendency has something to do
with nostalgia for time when poets like Tennyson were read by nearly
everyone who read newspapers and magazines. Harold Bloom, in his book "The
Anxiety of Influence" tries to restore the idea of a central poet for an
age. Surely most, if not all poets, these days are struggling with a way to
rationalize how the sum of their literary activities adds up to anything
resembling the conventional concept of a career. By focusing on how specific
works, or how certain series of works by particular poets might represent
specific advances in the field,it may be possible to further greater
cohesion in the field. Listening to poems seems to focus attention on the
poems themselves in relation to the poet's identity, while the book as
object seems to focus attention on the identity of the poet in relation to
the poem. In this regard, I noticed an interesting Web Site recently that
compiles available poetry on audio at http:/www.laurable.com

For 8 years straight (as Alan says) to this list, without allowing anyone
the humanizing amenity of choice: i.e. to click or not to click a link, and
expecting everyone else to accommodate them because of their private agenda,
I would absolutely object.

It's not a matter of taste, it's a matter of principle.

If you don't understand, please try to.

I don't know Alan Sondheim personally.  I admire his ambition and his
energy, but there are other equally gifted people on this list who are just
as ambitious and energetic and they publish elsewhere.  Why should we make
an exception for Alan when Alan himself refuses to give us cogent reasons
for doing so?

If Alan uses links for many of his "creative" postings, then there would
absolutely be no problem.  I would go back to lurking.

And just think: posting links would be a true test for Alan's fans.  Would
they make that extra "click" to commune with their inspiring leader?  Find
out the skinny on Nukuko for that moment?  Marvel over all those numbers and
suggestive words? Hell, Alan could even hook up a counter to see how many
people take a peek!  In addition, links take up less space on a hard drive,
do not bore or offend, and are easy to delete.

( But hey!--I really think that Alan posts so much because he craves
attention, and now he's secretly happy because he's getting lots and lots.
Well, God bless you, son-- enjoy!)

Finally, I'm not trying to shout anybody down.  Alan's claque is taking care
of that well enough.  I'm just one person pointing out the obvious.

Thanks for that pointer in use of language, Maria.  Thanks to Jane, too, for
her offer of tea, etc.  And thank you, Brandon!  No horns and hooves for me,
thank you!

Honestly, the larger game is the whole idea of cyber-lit. and how it appears
to be a ladder leading to corporate thinking and corporate-size economics. I
mean really, Miekal, Alan, and Konstantin--and sure, I'll include you Lewis,
because you appear to need attention too-- Disney, or Bell laboratories, or
any number of government agencies could do your cyber-art or cyber-lit. much
better than you could ever do it.

There--I didn't even use that big gun that Patrick went ape about.

Love,

Jesse.

This is crucial, Alan, to an understanding of your work; thanks for posting
it.  If I understand it, then, the reason you choose text email lists as a
distribution method for certain of your works is because it occurs for you
within the environment of those activities?  In other words, you are
harvesting, moving, creating, and distributing within the same world, the
Unix shell.  How much time do you spend distributed?  Do you have constant
access?

The reason I ask is that it is clear that others are experiencing your work
OUTSIDE the Unix workspace--on CD-ROMs, through POP email clients--and I
wonder if that changes the work, just as HTML formatting and HTTP
distribution would change it.

I only bring this up because with once we distribute bits instead of atoms,
we have such little control over how the work will be received--indeed,
turned on end, this is an underlying strength of the digital.

Jesse has, it seems in his last few messages, honed his objections
slightly--they aren't to your work per se (he's not attacking you as an
artist) but to the fact that your messages AREN'T advertisements, aren't
links to work housed elsewhere (because he cannot wander in distributed
space because every moment online costs money).  In his situation, I can to
some extent understand his concerns.  Everyone, including you, has
suggested using the delete key of a filter to remove all that is
"Sondhiemish" from Poetics.  Unfortunately, it isn't quite that cut and
dried.  You have phenomenal things to say, Alan, and provide lucid
perspectives on a variety of discussions besides also posting work.  In
other words, I'm trying to imagine someone who loves your discussions of
Kristeva but doesn't understand or is put of by your avatars--Jennifer or
Nikuko.  And I could see how that reader might feel that the sage Alan who
participates in discussion is phenomenally interesting or at least not
disinteresting while being repulsed by Nikuko.  And I could see how someone
might feel that your work walks a fine line on Poetics: Poetics welcomes
advertisements of work, but says nothing about distribution; Poetics
discourages pseudonyms, your work (though posted under your name) deals
heavily with multiple voices and avatars; etc.

Now, I personally don't feel this way.  I think I see both sides of the
issue though.  Jesse (and others, he says) doesn't mind your work but would
prefer it to be kept on a webpage or a weblog and that only links be posted
(what many artists do with their web projects).  Alan know that solution
fundamentally changes the work.

impasse / at every end
there is a circling
a retreading, a retreat

I'll go back to my graffiti metaphor.  I guess I'm happy with the argument,
with the impasse.  I always feel a little said when my school paints over
the bathroom walls.  Sure, it covers the bigoted statements, phone numbers,
and dirty jokes.  That's what saddens me, I guess.  It covers them up,
encourages silence, discourages response.

Of course they could.  They have the resources and the financial know-how
and wherewithal to withstand risk.  That's why Barnes & Noble can always
kick the hell out of small presses.  That doesn't make it right, but it
begs the question of how to go about the issue.  Mail art is one end-around
the system, allowing people to distribute without getting their asses
kicked.  There have to be other ways.

As cyber-artists we have resources too, but inherently we're stuck in such
a western print-author mentality (and I am too, completely) that it is
difficult to combine talents in a way that would compete with the
Studios.  It doesn't mean we aren't reaching out--Miekal's wiki does this,
and so do code-sharing projects and open-source movements.  But it is
difficult to transition, especially from within the political and
ideological juggernaut that is academia.

What I'm suggesting is that big-business is only more obvious in its
controls of the digital.  They just as completely control and create what
happens in traditional print.

This also might be a reason Alan doesn't post links, since the WWW (brought
to you by Microsoft and AOL) is inherently commercial and Unix is not.

the problem is that some people efface themselves.

some of us (me) really have no interest in the larger
debate on cyber-lit, etc. one way or another. don't
dislike it. don't like it. don't get it. don't really
(at this moment in my reading life) care to get it.
it's not on my radar screen in any way (i imagine at
some historical moment in the future writers like me
will be considered incredibly hindsighted,
reactionary, etc. but whatever)

so i routinely delete alan's posts when i see his name
(unless they are particular responses to a thread i am
following). sorry, but the many times i *have* opened
them and read i've had positively no reaction. so i
just don't read them.

so i never get to alan's points or opinions about
anything else. which may, honestly, be okay with him.
but that's at least partially the choice of the writer
when he says "just use the delete key"--

i just think, "uh... okey-doke."

i think alan should absolutely keep posting whatever
he likes as often he likes. but i think it's become
obvious that not everyone is going to listen.

Several questions.
-Does the field advance? If so, to where, where do we want to go?
-What about electronic poetry? Does this dim the aura?
And then we (always) travel back to:
-What makes a writing event a poem?

JESSE:Honestly, the larger game is the whole idea of
cyber-lit. and how it
appears
to be a ladder leading to corporate thinking and
corporate-size
economics. I
mean really, Miekal, Alan, and Konstantin--and sure,
I'll include you
Lewis,
because you appear to need attention too-- Disney, or
Bell
laboratories, or
any number of government agencies could do your
cyber-art or cyber-lit.
much
better than you could ever do it.



LEWIS:Well, okay.
See, the thing is, Disney's NOT doing it.
What draws me to "cyber-lit" (whatever that is) is the
potential. What I seek, when I create a work of net
art, is to craft a work that depends on the user for
its manifestation. And I don't mean this in the
abstract; I mean it quite literally. I don't want to
create passive works. I don't want to re-invent
television or the cinema.
Of course, much of what you're saying here applies to
language itself. Did you invent the language you write
in, Jesse? Hmmmm, Robert Ludlum makes a killing off
it. Language is bred into you by the culture at large,
which also means it's alien to you (which, I believe,
is one of the points our old friends the
"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E" poets brought up in their theory).
Fender made my guitar, but I don't think Fender owns
what I do with it. Likewise, Macromedia "owns" Flash
(they did not invent it; FutureFlash predates
Macromedia, I believe, and was the earliest
incarnation of the program), but Flash is only a tool,
just as HTML is and JavaScript and network itself.
For me, net art is about interactivity, about taking a
certain degree of control from the aurthor and putting
it into the hands of the reader. It is a potentiality.
Because the network has a lot of corporate affiliation
(and its origin was in the military,
remember===Licklider and the Arpanet) bothers me but
little. Unless you're making the paper you write on
(if you write on paper) and the ink you use (if you
use ink), then you too are working in a medium that
has corporate affiliations. What's a university these
days but a corporate breeding ground?
When I make a net work, i strive to create something
that can't be duplicated in any other medium. Works
like these can't be "books," or films, or video, or
any other medium. THEY REQUIRE THE NETWORK. And the
network is a large collection of nodes on which
individuals sit at keyboards. What's so corporate
about that?

Yes, but Williams got it from Pound and Pound got it from Pope and if
you trace it back far enough, you will see that the use of names is all
over Catullus.

When I came across it in Berrigan, O'Hara, etc. as a teenager, I never

Why isn't it enough to be a poet and be the best poet you can be?  I
remember long ago a back and forth with Jacques Debrot.  (Are you out there,
Jacques?)

It's like not playing baseball because you can't be Hank Aaron or Babe Ruth.

I Reply:

Damn. I wanted to say that. Actually, there should be a distinction
made here, because almost all poets make some use of naming, no
matter what the aesthetic leanings. A cursory look at my bookshelf
shows me T.S. Eliot, Robert Lowell, Philip Levine, Sharon Olds,
Michael Palmer, etc all who make use of this device, to very different
effect. Thankfully.

What I think is being said is the TONE that goes with the NAME . . .
Sharon Olds and O'Hara are after different fish and it's the tone that
brings that off, not the naming act itself.

That's kind of off the cuff, and I'm feeling exposed now that I've
admitted to owning books by Levine and Olds . . . but honest, I DO
like _My Life_ better, I promise!

I Reply:

I agree! (Well, with a caveat: many poets who are admired for writing
admirable poems are admired by those who are told that these poets
write admirable poems. Alas, but it has always been so. That said, I
greatly admire Ashbery, even though many people tell me I should
admire him. As well, I admire Bin Ramke, Rae Armantrout, and
several others, because whenever I get a book of theirs, I discover
new things, not just in a poem, but in the poetry. Many people can
write a good poem. Few can write great poetry.)

Jim Writes:

Why isn't it enough to be a poet and be the best poet you can be?

I reply:

I agree! Again! The planets must be in alignment or something. The
point is to do it and to keep doing it. The doing of poetry is always
and never enough. Which is why I will always suspect unmediated
chance operations. Often they are wonderful in the short run, but they
all blur to white noise over time. Chance has an interesting way of
repeating itself. Or maybe a not so interesting way?

Jordan,
In a lecture Naropa's Kerouac School in '77 Berrigan explains his use of
names in poems in comparison to the names apparent in Greek epic poetry,
i.e. Homer, and also, in Dante. He says something like, and I'm
paraphrasing, that the names he's using will be just as interesting to
someone reading his poems in 100 years as Agamemnon or Virgil, etc. I wish I
could dig up the recording right now, as Berrigan's explanation is very
funny, and perhaps characteristically, colorful. I think he says something
like the names Joe, Dick, and Ron are just as good as the name of some
ancient "dago." In well mannered jest of course.

Dear All,

I have recently rejoined Buffalo Poetics after a very long break.  It's
great to see many of the usual suspects here, in addition to a whole
raft of contributors new to me.  It was initially dismaying to read
Jesse's insulting posts to Alan Sondheim - but I'm delighted that this
thread has led to Alan's post yesterday, which generously invites
insight into the range, passion, philosophy, and process of his work.
When I started participating in poetry listservs 6 years ago Alan
Sondheim's work was a real ball of delight and surprise.  Now I consider
it the warp or woof of poetry listervs: it is a distinctive part of the
texture of my experience of poetry listservs.  As well gnaw at my
fingertips or entrails as attack Alan Sondheim's work.  As well condemn
Horowitz for posting to the piano or Pollack for posting to the canvas
as Sondheim for posting to poetry listservs.  This is his medium and
he's working it, goddammit he's working it!  He's the weather of poetry
listservs (Kent Johnson's the weathercock!).  His subject lines are
playbills and television guides-- I flick through his pieces just for
the look of them.  I don't have much time but he's an amphetamine.

My metaphors are terrible.  The metaphors on this list in general are
terrible.  All this stuff about "depth" and "richness" and "delving" as
if art was a big old farm held in lien by a "long tradition of
excellence."  I welcome Alan's MOOs and awks, and his unconventional
harvestings.  A computer may be a mind incapable of metaphor (I'll have
to think about it); if so, the mind, insofar as it bounded by numbingly
conventional metaphors, is not at such an advantage.

Viva Alan!

One thing of interest here - at least for me it touches on the
methodology
I'll employ at times - is Eliza and the ability to rework Eliza. Eliza
is
available in emacs (under 'doctor'), and it's possible to go into the
doctor program itself, and alter things - I rewrote it as a Nikuko text
-
which I then used as a catalyst for producing work and answers in
relation
to a litany of seduction that was the final result. Chance operations,
expert programs, are there for the modification/transformation - a MOO
is
of course the best-known example of that. And all of this is
tremendously
exciting - the ability to take a world and remake it, to create a
dialectic between one's own desires and interests, and what the machinic
is bringing to life. The conflict or coherence that results becomes part
and parcel of the content; it's neither one way nor another.

The same goes for chance operations - the julu/julua/parent/etc. perl
scripts I use as catalysts for writing on occasion all have vocabulary
which I can change - even create a work within the vocabulary itself.
This
modification leads to a similar dialectic. Even awk scripts can be used
in
this way - I can write a text in which each line is a letter or dipthong
substitute, for example, then begin with a shorter ur-text that
organizes
the other.

None of this means that the result has to be final, unless there is a
reason, aesthetic or philosophical, to give the result up to the
machine.
But it provides a way to see in/through/ structure, to accommodate and
critique structure, to even create a political economy of structure (as
the 'character essay' pieces I make, do - since each word + its punctua-
tion is used only once).

The world is violent, extraordinary, filled with wonder, noisy, ahd
chaotic (both in the strict senses of the terms); working with these
elements is, in part, an attempt to make, proclaim, enunciate, meaning
and
a sememe within forces that are somewhat beyond our control.

To answer another question - the philosophy of publishing daily - this
is
a philosophy of distribution; the writing is done online, using online
programs that I write or modify; I write in a shell account, which means
there are up to a hundred other users on the same machine - I can see
what
they're doing - and the distribution, like the production, is naturally
electronic. Rightly or wrongly, I also see my work as central to the
subject - Poetics - of this list; for example, the MOO piece sent out
the
day before yesterday with the result of interacting with three MOOs in
turn - on two of them, I was Nikuko, and on one, Alan - and so the
dialog
spread across domains and worlds. And in the other piece, the same day,
the one dealing with mutilation - I did a series of "greps" on my entire
body of work - all of the online texts I've written since 1994 - and
pulled out the lines with "mutilat" in them; these lines were then
arranged and modified in accordance with current politics, which are a
horror that must be stopped at any cost. And this way of working -
harves-
ting previous work, looking for patterns, etc. - is similar to a kind of
dream interpretation - reading through a huge mind-storm of material,
finding the thinking-structures, topic-based, analyzing them, working
with
them, opening them up once again. This harvesting is entirely computer-
dependent; what I did would take a week to do manually, for example.

All of this - moving among virtual worlds, distributing on the fly,
harvesting the work of previous writing - seems to me highly germane to
the topics of this list - collusions among distribution systems,
protocols, computers, programs, routers, bodies of previously-written
work, online virtual worlds, etc. -

- Alan, wandering

i think we're back to author-fixation now, which came up a few months
ago (process v producer) now we seem to be on product v/ producer...
i think often people use the name of the author as a shorthand for a
body of work; it's convenient, but like most conveniences, limiting
to the way bodies of work are conceived of--as coming only from an
atomized individual rather than being a trace or marker of the
confluence of sensibility, history, culture, place, circumstances,
etc.

Old whining in new bottles? That's for you guys to decide. I am too close t=
o
my words and only notice their stinky breaths.

(By the way, MB, I don't see how I am using "depth" in any way as a
metaphor! Are you denying that it is a worthy quality of art? If so, then
woe is humanity!)


AS's comments are interesting on the whole. But if I may be allowed to
nibble at his toes as is my wont. . .

I find it debatable whether a loose gathering of people on the Internet
constitutes a "world" of any kind, which leaves me unclear as to what value
there is in wandering through it and harvesting its organs of "parole." Has
anybody done a statistical analysis of this world? Does it have specific
anthropological characteristics worth illuminating? Or is it simply a big
globalized blob into which one can read pretty much anything one likes? I
tend to support the blob theory myself.

Dialectic smhialectic! AS's reading of the Frenchies is way behind the
times. A&(-A)->S is a tattered old hat! Time for a new overcoming!

> political economy of structure

What can this mean? Whose politics? Whose economy? Whose structure? And to
get all that out of a simple perl program? Astonishing, if true.

Isn't imitating the chaos of the world in a poem the classic pathetic
fallacy? Instead of building a fictive chaos that attempts to mirror the
real chaos of today's world, perhaps it would be preferable to seek the ide=
a
of order (pace Stevens) that underlies every urge towards chaos. But that's
just me. Answering insanity with sanity, not more insanity. The still quiet
drip that cracks the rock, given world enough and time. (Both of which migh=
t
soon be in short supply, if the devil dogs in Washington get their way.)

A poem on the page exists as an inert substance waiting for the reader to
catalyze its elements and bring it to life. It's this waiting that seems to
me to set the work of art apart from anything else. Not only is the work of
art - the poem - waiting to be read but it is waiting to be entered into.
This is what makes it different from other forms of writing. The reader's
engagement with a poem follows a diversity of branches and root-paths. It i=
s
the most engaged form of reading there is. Write a poem that demands to be
reread many times and that's all the politics and propaganda you will need
to bring the enemy to its knees. Write a poem that can be tossed out with
yesterday's trash and you have done nobody any good.

Moving on. . .

My worry is that because of its ease of use the cut-up is rapidly becoming
the new clich=E9. It is the perfect technique for today's ADD generation of
short attention spans and instant gratifications. The cut-up is a flashy
brainless quick-cutting MTV music video for the loose-lipped literati.

JA: Please do read Burroughs again! (I tried The Soft Machine recently and
couldn't make it past the first few pages.) I'd be very interested to hear
what you think of him after such a prolonged hiatus. One of the great
astonishments of reading is to learn what is gotten from rereading
something, and I always am amazed to see how my views can change through th=
e
years with regard to an author's work.

I frankly don't think any monkey pounding aimlessly at a keyboard could eve=
r
produce a readable text the length of Hamlet, let alone the quality.[*] The
odds against it are beyond astronomical. But let's assume for the sake of
argument that it happens one day. Or more generally, let's ask: Does it
matter if a real person lies behind the creation of a work of art rather
than a machine? My simple answer is yes. Machine creations are emphatically
not works of art because there is no mind that guides them into being. (I a=
m
assuming they haven't been programmed or otherwise been given brain-like
features.) Nonetheless, we may still admire machine creations in the same
way we admire the creations of nature: trees, mountains, rocks etc. But the=
y
are technically not works of art even if they may be something equally
brilliant and beautiful and complex. Art is not a big tent term. It means
something specific (but DON'T ASK!), and I think we should keep it that way=
.
It doesn't spell the end of the world if something is not a work of art. It
simply means that it is something different, and maybe just as good in its
own way.

So what about painting elephants and the like? Well, there is inarguably a
mind at work in this case, but it is not a terribly evolved one, so I would
say that they might indeed be making a marginal kind of art - this is
assuming that elephants are aesthetically aware, which is problematic in
itself - but certainly not good art. Good art being art that enriches the
mind on many levels and depths (sorry MB!), not merely because it is
beautiful, jolting etc.

This is getting into heady philosophical territory that may not be suited t=
o
this forum. Let me turn to something else. . .

> 4'3" one of Cage's defective pieces?

No, actually I think 4'33" is one of Cage's masterstrokes and perhaps his
greatest work. If only because he has removed himself so radically from any
direct line of creation to bring it into being and yet the piece still
engages one again and again as a fully realized work. In fact it may be the
only work of art in existence that will never go stale, because it only
comes into being when it is performed. Outside of that there is nothing to
see, nothing to study, nothing to like or to hate. It is the perfect
embodiment of art as nothingness that contains the world.

> It's the fear that the lazy might inherit the earth.

You mean they haven't already?! I am definitely opposed to laziness in
others and myself, but I certainly don't fear it. Could we drop the word
please? You make me sound like I am skulking in dark corners and writhing i=
n
agony every time a case of laziness spooks me out of my shell!

And finally. . .

Wizzdom of the Day: I think far too many poets abuse their oracular
privileges. Just because one is a poet doesn't make one into a high priest.
Even Mallarme recognized that you make a poem with words, not thunderbolts.


[*] I am reminded of the computer-generated painting done in the style of
Mondrian that a majority of people selected as being preferable to the real
Mondrian on which it was based. Of course anybody with a good art backgroun=
d
can see immediately why the real Mondrian is superior to its cheap
imitation. All that this experiment proves is that people are generally
stupid when it comes to appreciating modern art, and prefer to engage with
easeful decision-making processes over the complexity of a genuinely unique
mind at work. We only have to look at whom we elect as president every four
years in this country to see how often this sad observation is borne out.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This is from a talk Berrigan gave in 76 (from Talking
Poetics From Naropa Institute vol.1):

"Larry Fagin, when he teaches class, likes to give out
work-sheets with poems on them that don't have the
authors' names after the poems. Poems by famous dead &
the famous and moderately famous living. And then you
get to talk about the poems, you being all of you. And
then--but there is a secret in there. Because Larry
knows who wrote them, because he selected the poems
and typed them out. And so he's got you, in a funny
way. And--but he's brilliant enough to think that he
really hasn't that that doesn't really give him any
edge. Because he has an idea, which is that the poem
is more important than the poet. But the poem is not
more important than the poet. Not one bit, actually.
Not as long as anyone knows the name of the poet."

Admittedly, I'm often attracted to poets w/ "names"
but that's because they've--for me--already
established an entrance point for my reading, a kind
of self referentiality within the body of their work
that I'm familiar with. For example after reading all
of Mackey's work, when I see a journal featuring him
I'm inclined to flip to his poems, as they carry a
resonance with the rest of his writing. This is also
true--for me-- for the work of poets not actively
constructing such an ongoing singularity within their
work. I guess it's that I always measure a poet
against her previous work.
  I've had the experience of writing poems which don't
sound like "me" and decided to shelve much of them,
but it's an interesting issue...how many of you all
have decided against publishing specific work you've
written because it doesn't fit it the framework of
your personal canon?

one more thing:

here are two instances of the type of naming which is
most appealing to me

Liz Willis from "A Maiden":

Conductor you knit me

Albert Mobilio from "Me with Animal Towering":

So go cremator.

There's something much more gestural here, which,
while avoiding the possibility of "distancing" a
reader unfamiliar w/ a specific person, also has a
sort of intimacy and tenderness/toughness. I like
that...

are you suggesting that
listening to poems thus is more unmediated
by nagging eg-centered poet-author or even the idea of a person
than reading poems in books?

or am i reading the thrust of your argument wrong?

Read My Tiny Life by Dibbell, or Turkle's life on the screen; you can also
get in touch w/ Jon Marshall, an anthropologist who's been studying (and
participating in) the Cybermind list forever - his thesis is 600 rather
interesting pages on this.

If you've been on a MOO you realize there are at least two sorts of
stratifications - those based on quota (on PMC I was on the quota review
board), and those based on programming knowledge. The economy is similar
to that described in Bourdieu's Distinction.

I'm talking about chaos in the technical sense, as deterministic but
unstable from a (human) phenomenological viewpoint. I've written a lot of
chaos programs for years. I'm not Stevens; I have no interest in his
approach. There's room for everything.

This is interesting in terms of Heidegger's notion of releasement. But
hopefully my poems can be reread many times; as I've said repeatedly,
they're not chance-work - and even if they were, I'd still hope the same.

Well - my own work's not cut-up, but certainly cut-up or programming is
hardly "easier" than more traditional forms of writing. Measuring the
labor involved would be of interest here.

A few things; that is only part of the reason. Another is that the work
is, as described, a continuous meditation on virtual subjectivity, the
subjectivity of cyberspace, prosthesis, etc. As far as time online - I'm
not really sure - it used to be 4-5 hours; now it's more like 2-3, because
I have more powerful unix shells offline than on (and they're more config-
urable).

The cd-rom distribution contains the URL of the website; files are added
on a regular basis. But in a file, the structure is linear; online, it's
more dispersed. What has really changed is my videowork - which is usually
presented in a cdrom directory; one can move through scenes and/or pieces
in any order, construct any order. The work is designed for that. And
there are questions of bandwidth. The bandwidth of any of the email posts,
say, on Poetics, is remarkably small; there are lists where on occasion
someone sends 100k or so, but most of the stuff here is under, say, 5-10k.

Absolutely - and the digital is both 'eternal' in the sense of infinitely
copyable, no originals, and remarkably fragile - re: delete, outmoded
technologies, router errors, and so forth.

Well certainly. Again a few things. I never use pseudonyms. If I'm
directly participating in a discussion, my part is usually quoted. And as
for the usual delete-key argument, everyone I know has filters set up - I
do as well. If anyone wants to make an issue of it, it's absurd. No one
can read everything; with spam, I'm over 400 messages a day at this point.

A final point here - I see this work as a continuous practice (not these
explanatory posts btw); Nikuko and Kristeva inhabit the same space/world -
even theoretically, one can draw a parallel between the Kristevan chora
and list-space, for example.

It would completely change the work, and I simply do not understand this.
If I sent out a URL a day, it's the same delete.

Sometimes I think the Net's history parallels that of Times Square - which
is now hyper-hygienic, thanks to Giuliani. But let's not forget that
poetry covers murder as well, pornography and epiphanies, absolutions and
damnations, etc. Not like Times Square. Not like Disney.

The Leaf Collector


Outside, the buzz of the leaf collector grows louder,
approaching as steadily as the long hand
of a clock sweeps off minutes.  It’ll arrive
and won’t find a long range of leaves rising
from the curb by my house, a gap in the circle
of leaves that surrounds the block.  Leaves
cover my lawn inches deep, they’re caught
in the shrubs, the bushes, lawn chairs, patio
furniture, grill legs, clothesline, carport,
compost heap, porch light, vegetable garden,
rain gutters, patio stones, privacy walls,
the gardening bench and shed.  They cover
the roof, the screens, sidewalk, drift over
the threshold.  Cracks in the windows
are stuffed with leaves.  A few lie
behind the couch, under the coffee table,
in the shelves, beside the TV, beneath
the crib, on the bed, surrounding the toilet,
in my toes and fingers and my hair is thick
with leaves and leaves turn water and air into sugar,
protect trees from predators,
release moisture so the tree
can pull water from its roots
to its crown.

Of Pettet John Ashbery has written:

"Like Beethoven's Bagatelles, Simon Pettet's short poems have a great deal
to say, and their seemingly modest dimensions help rather than hinder his
saying it. =A0An unorthodox lucidity reminiscent of Schuyler, a certain
English dappleness and an oriental concision blend in poetry whose sweet,
complex fragrance is Pettet's secret."

These were the key sentences in his post. Some responses miss his point,
which was to pick up his previous thread about the 'progress of poesie', and
to rescue the rhetoric of 'excellence' 'quality' etc. from the forces of
reaction, division,  etc and place it within  field of discussion whose
terms contribute to a greater sense of cohesion and common purpose. I think
he proposes a relation between 'career' (the sum of your literary
activities) not only to the 'field' of poetry, but to its 'progress' that
can be talked about without falling into talk of careerism, elitism, or
vanguardism. Science was offered as a 'field'  in which this was possible.
The two threads, which are somewhat intertwined,Alan's work and his
'distribution'; and the meaning of meaninglessness), have helped to produce
some discriminations regarding, message to noise ratios, and  'cut-up' which
help define the field (and clarify mis-readings in the process).

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I would be interested in hearing about how various
individuals on this list perceive their own work, with
reference to scope and definition (of projects,
processes and the like). As is evident from the most
recent twenty or perhaps even forty years, many
writers conceive of their work as "one big thing,"
process-based, and so forth. At the same time, this is
likely not to be true for everyone assembled here.
Despite what may be a disinclination for some to
consider writing to be product-oriented, I am
interested in how various people would describe their
concept of the work that they are doing.

The question emerges on the heels of the recent (and
perhaps current) discussion about posting, posting
poetry, venues for publishing, and the like.

Thanks to all for their thoughts on the naming issue---
it's helped me begin writing maybe about it a little
(don't know what I'm gonna do with it yet...)

and yes, trivia---also means crossorads, no?

Anyway, one quick response to Noah Gordon (any relation to NADA?)


Yeah, but more importantly, what of MRS. PAPPADOPOULOUS?

in a grad seminar I was teaching 2-3 years ago, lots of the students
complained about reading MIDWINTER DAY--saying, among other things, that all
the stuff addressed to Lewis made them feel left out (?).  I thought this
was a bizarre response (and still do) and asked them how they felt when the
went to see, say, Hamlet.

but someone recently told me that students at Naropa had the same reaction.

meanwhile, PERSONISM is certainly worth re-reading, maybe esp., in relation
to this thread, the assertion that it was when he realized that instead of
writing the poem addressed to the person he could just phone the person up
that personism achieved lift-off. there's something odd about that, though
it makes sense.

Whilst many of the same theories of writing apply equally to poetry
composed for the page, the stage and the digital domain, the
exploration of poetry in cyberspace offers for me, and many others,
an opportunity to play with words in a new space. New theories are
also being proposed and books by Loss Pequeno Glazier, 'Digital
Poetics - the making of e-poetry', Espen Aarseth's 'Cybertext -
Perspectives of Ergodic Literature' and Jerome McGann's 'Radiant
Textuality' all begin to ascribe a new poetics and aesthetics to what
is happening. All of them have a strange mixture of scientific
experimentation and poetic aspiration, their theories tied to their
on-going practical problem-solving with web technologies and poetic
forms and content. We seem to have entered a phase of convergence of
the writer/theorist/critic and the whole end-user experience being
more of a writerly experience as well as readerly one, more of a
collaborative experience than a solitary one, and more of an
of-the-moment rather than universal or enduring experience.
Postmodernist theory certainly prepared us for the random
interventions, tangential associations, bricolage composition,
layered information, multiple interpretations and multitudes of
meanings for meaning itself that are characteristic of poetry in
cyberspace  today. Image and sound, as well as words, are a part of
language, a way in which we 'read' the world. The poet's vocabulary
in cyberspace has expanded to include images, sound, animated
sequences, random or choices in direction, colours and 3D spatial
arrangements. The end-user in cyberspace is also prepared to
contribute more to the making of the poetry that cyberpoem and
end-user can create.

My most recent works are made with Macromedia Flash.

I see them as timelines within timelines. They have no temporal
length as such. Unlike a performance poem, for example, that can be
sounded in 58 seconds or a printed poem that is one and a half pages
long, my Flash cyberpoems hopefully attract the end-user into the
poem, offer certain enticements for engagement and finish when the
end-user has decided they have had enough. Enjoy!

The nature of the monitor is an issue, certainly, that anyone who works to the digital has to
take into account, because it can make reading very difficult. Like email. Black background is
easier on the eyes. White background is hardest on the eyes.

Barbara pointed out that the distribution and printing of books have their own limitations. I
live in Canada; there isn't much distribution of Canadian books abroad. Whereas Web sites can be
accessed rather widely.

In broad outline, Richard, the idea is to combine arts and media. And also arts and media and
programming, for me, anyway. I understand it isn't to everyone's interest, but I find it
exciting to try to develop a sense of composition that involves text, sound, image, animation,
programming, and whatever else you can throw in the pot. Video one of these days.

I think this approach to poetry is and will attract good minds and artists because of its
international and multimedial dimensions, and its synthesis of art and technology/science.

Each to his own, Richard.

I use my hands quite a bit. And invite people to use theirs in my work. Voice is also involved.
But all media are separate from the body; that's what makes them media. Including the page and
the book.

Bodman is one of the most interesting poets of the second Great Awakening
standing midway between Philip Freneau and the Transcendentalists.  The
introduction to his Oration is a spiritual diary recounting how he was
tormented by visions of Heaven and Hell and the ghost of his wife.  A
selection of poems from the Oration is included.  Jesse

Kind of. I don't know about this list, which has many times more lurkers
than speakers-up. But a small Yahoogroup I'm on is currently reeling -- a
friend of mine from that group was shot to death this month. Search on
"Katie Hill" at the Washington Post or Seattle Post-Intelligencer websites
and you can probably still pull up the articles. The group is small, but
widely geographically dispersed -- one member is currently teaching in
China. Nevertheless, even those who had known Katie only through the list
and some snail-mail are severely affected, in fact reeling, and sending
profuse condolences to her husband and parents.

A poet friend of mine has fairly awful agoraphobia and lives 2000 miles
away from me besides. I have exchanged countless e-mails with her over the
years, as well as a few phone calls, and we have inscribed copies to each
other of her book and my chapbook. I haven't the foggiest idea what she
actually looks like. Would I grieve her, quite severely, under similar
circumstances? Would she leave a hole in my heart if she were gone? Damn
skippy.

I don't know what a "world" is. I can hang with saying "community."

Dear Richard,
             Talking about Saddam, I was reading up on him on the net
recently and to my surprise I discovered he has actually published a number
of writings,some intellectual,military,economic etc.Obviously a clever
guy,but with bad intentions.Apparently he was shot in the leg in the early
sixties as part of a coup attempt.and actually was elected to parliament
while being under arrest.Strangely he has the same astrological birth sign
and chinese sign as Hitler, a Taurus Buffalo.

Tony. Your thought is disordered, and I like you and you have met me and so
on, I live in the same city (Auckland)....Well then  the US and G Bush
Senior backed Saddam Hussein right up to the Gulf War then they helped him
gas the Kurds but the British (with Churchill's blessing had had a go at the
Kurds some time previously ) and the British and Americans are currently
bombing targets (they bomb everything and anything that moves as they did in
Korea nothing has changed). The US backed Saddam Hussein and re-armed him
after the Gulf war prior to that they backed both sides (but making sure
that Hussein wasnt overwhelmed as they were terrified that either the Kurds
or Shiites or any popular  democratic Govt - or any group they couldnt
control -(the US always backs dictators, never democratic regimes: eg they
ignored the UN decision for democratic elections in Vietnam after the French
were beaten and they are ILLEGALY bombing in the no fly zones (which are
ILLEGAL under international law).As well Iraq gas complied with all requests
for arms reductions etc... (Coversatation Pliger and  Boutros Boutos-Gahli
the previous Sec of the UN and other UN officials) (Some very low serving
and high ranking officials have resigned at the atrocities they see being
commited by the US in Iraq). Also the British and US stay "home" in Turkey
 a Muslim state in NATO) while they allow the Turks to bomb and kill
hundreds of Kurds. (There have been some potests by US military personal to
this blind-eyeing).

I wasnt talking about Saddam Hussein I was quoting John Pilger whose books
eg "the Secret Country" and "The New Rulers of the World" might open your
eyes...also there is a book I have re-acquired called "Rape of Vietnam" by
Harold Slingsby (but there are many books and mags aside form eg The New
York Times (in fact the NZ Herald is a good source of info and Scott
Hamilton could put you on to more "left wing" zines online and other).
Remember that unlike Cheney, Rumsfeld, Bush etc' Pilger has visited Iraq
(and he has no desire to control the vast oil wealth (and the cheap labour
markets and the drugs and misery) over there includiing the Caspian sea that
Bush's soul-mate Adolf Hitler so coverted in WW2) ...

 Iraq is no threat to the World but the US and Israel are: if the US is
truly concerned they would abandon military means totally and ... in fact
this should be the aim of all countries to move to a truly democratic and a
true united nations including ALL countries but since at least the 2ndWW the
US have caused the deaths of more individuals than Hitler ever dreamed of.
You have  Theocratic Fascism in the US with a religious crackpot in charge:
in NZ our Prime Minister to our credit has refused to support the US if they
attack Iraq, Australia's Prime Minister is a thug and is supporting them:
already devastated by the sanctions and the constant bombings by British and
US aircraft.  At least 5000 children and others die per month in Iraq
because of the effects of the radiation from depleted uranium and the lack
of sufficient food and medical supplies. Iraq's people suffer and Saddam
Hussein stays there: unaffected  with his cronies: the whole thing by Bush
is a desparate attempt to continue the insane policy of bombing and bullying
in coordination with Israel: theere have  and are now serious moves to put
Bush, Blair and many others who are responsible (and people in respectable
and "high" professional positions including respected academics) for
genocidal activities on trial like Milosovich. But Saddam Hussein could also
be tried. I dont support dictators o wherever they are - but prior to the
Gulf War (Hussein was probably egged on by the US) the US built up Saddam
hussein (that is wel known) and Iraq because or despite Hussein had a very
high literacy ad rate and clean water  and so on: a very good wel-fare
system (which the US would have hated and also the Thatcherites and
Rogernomicists over here) Meanwhile the Saudis have just i the last few days
withdrawn several billions from the US and invested it in Europe. Qatar is
refusing to allow US to use its country for attacks from there.  Where are
those of courage in Turkey? They should boot theYanks out: ask Partrick
Herron his thinking on this...but I'm not "backing Saddam Hussein" or caring
when or where he was born. The US always use or misuse some patsy: like  a
big Mafia (they use the Mafia probably as well via the CIA)...but going into
all those numbers is stupid. Hussein is no Hitler, as you sayin fact he is
quite bright (but so was A H: but so what?) The issue is the devaastation
that has been caused to Iraq and the prospect of more bombing and killling.
There are thousands of peoples lives at stake. Think about the issues and
take a stand for or against the proposed attack on Iraq. Iraq the place of
the oldest civilisation faced and insulted by a barbarian nation....Learn
some politics and history: read more.  Richard Taylor.

Larger game? As in prey? You are already playing list-as-computer-game, Jesse. You aren't alone.
On many lists devoted to discussion of poetics of different arts, there is no shortage of people
incapable of practicing and furthering the art and poetics and who take it upon themselves to
make such discussion difficult or impossible. To do so is much easier, given the nature of
lists, than the art or the poetics. I've been seeing a lot of this recently on this list, on
Rhizome_Raw, on Eu-Gene, and am familiar with it on webartery. It is depressing and makes me
wonder about the value of lists as forums capable of discussing and furthering the art and
poetics. So much spiteful resistance to creativity and inventive language with the very machines
used to communicate via the lists. Egotism mixed with fear that poetry might actually change.

> and how it appears
> to be a ladder leading to corporate thinking and corporate-size economics.

How much of the work have you even bothered to look at? Your comments are dripping with
ignorance about the art that you dismiss with a sneer. You'd like to see Alan back off to URLs
and now you say that "the larger game is the whole idea of cyber-lit". What do you want? A
uniform level of mediocrity across the board?

You seem to approve of computers well enough, Jesse, that I see you spend considerable time
writing email on them. Maybe even some art somewhere. Miekal and Komninos are trying to use them
in bringing different arts together, and in taking poetry in new directions not as tired as what
normally passes for poetry. This is not exactly the domain of the government or Disney or
whatever. What you say is willfully ignorant of the art and the situation you are in as you look
at the monitor and prepare to play another round of your tiresome computer game.

Alan is where you durst not go, Jesse. So too with Miekal, Komninos, and Lewis. Get used to it.

support Vispo as much of it I've seen. I dont think I could be knackered
doing it myself as I'm very lazy I cant hardly be bothered typing up my own
poems or even sending them even if I'm asked to contribute to things: (come
to think of it I get tired lifting food toward my nouth.....I used to so
love eating!) also I'm busy with trying to buiid a book business and make a
crust: but I am defininitely into anything that is multi media: of course
its not the book OR the hand or the computer OR the hand: nor am I into
"craft" as such.

this will address a few things currently rattling around the list====

{sheila asked about scope, whether some of us feel our work to be a whole or not...i myself do not see my work as a whole...i see it as a series of experiments or revelations toward an ideal...the ideal is interactivity, roping in the end-user, the reader, the audience, to enable them to create the work themselves...i see the progression from text---with a beginning in narrative, flowing into disjunctive and "language" texts--to net art, with all its porosity, fluidity---& in net art i see the beginning of the realization of the ideal: the network//the computer//code....}

{i've only been making net art for a little over a year...there were early experiments in html and javascript, but it wasn't until i became aquainted with (first) shockwave and (then) flash that i truly began to feel free...i'd been reaching in text all through the nineties for just this sort of interactivity====this ideal that it's the user who makes the work, not the author===which is why, after trying fiction, i swam over to poetry, and to disjunctive work at that====}

{for me, the whole purpose of net art is to create works that could not exist in any other form...this means using the computer and the network...it means writing code...which is a spangly very logical sort of english, no matter which computer language (we're not talking binary here, or even assembler)...i want the work to be unique for each user...hence, at times i use randomization algorithms...at others, i allow the user to trigger events in the piece through buttons and rollovers (though lately i've been trying to move beyond these, toward more code-based work)...for me, the use of randomization algorithms creates the potential for the work to be unique with each use...this is also achieved via user-input text which gets entwined with my own text or text culled from the net (see the works in the flash gallery at artifacts--http://webdelsol.com/Artifacts/ or at august highland's muse apprentice guild--http://www.muse-apprentice-guild.com/----depth is provided by the user, 
 is the crack between words, images, sounds, their overlap and resonance}

{it's not strictly about mixing media for me===that's been done, we have cinema already===& in general net art that is simply animation with sound doesn't excite me===i've lately been influenced by much of the work i see at rhizome and at furtherfield, by software art, browser art, work that moves beyond the hypertext...the link has long ceased to hold any interest for me...flash gets a bad rap because those who don't use it or who use it in a limited way only see the animation capabilities, the multimedia capabilities, and the ease of the GUI...what can be done in flash here, many argue, can just as easily be done in dhtml...flash is too easy, they say...me, i think flash is easy if all you want to do is make animations and use rollover buttons...(not to imply that there aren't beautiful works that do only these things, that are only animation and rollovers)---i'm excited by communion with the user, giving the sign back to the user...i want to create works in the gray region
 s between software art and "cyber-lit"}

{i feel jesse glass has a sour view of net work because he's only seen works that are primarily multimedia explorations...i invite him to broaden his horizon in regards to net art: there's a wonderful introduction to it at http://www.postmedia.net/netart.htm...or visit rhizome or furtherfield...hopefully you'll be as excited by the potential of what you see there as i am}

On Tuesday 8/27 I posted a poem entitled Things Considered Poetry?:  Twenty-First Century Edition and I know this poem was posted to the list because I received it on my messages.  On Wednesday 8/28 I received a message from the list serve teeling me that a message I sent was rejected for posting because I or someone else had posted something similar recently.  As best I could decipher the computerese, when people tried o respond to post using the reply button the list serve rejected the posting because it would post the poem again.  If this is somehow different from responding to other postings using the reply button or if this is an incorrect interpretation of what happened, please let me know.

Yes, Joel, I think there are advances in the field of poetics; these
advances are most dramatically seen in applications of techniques from
poetry and poetics to other fields and from other fields to poetry. There
was a tremendous density of such exchanges during the belle epoque. Mallarme
may very well be the inventor of the cut-up technique. His experiments with
typography set the stage for the invention of many boundary melting
applications of discoveries in poetics to other arts and other fields. For
me, modern poetics really begins with certain works by Poe, Baudelaire,
Mallarme and Valery. A good place to start is Valery's selection from his
notebooks in "Analects" (Bollingen). As for "where do we want poetics to
go?" surely few poets would disagree as to the many advantages of poets
having greater impact themselves on the attention given to their work. I
feel that if poets worked more closely together to the advantage of their
field, the efforts would eventually be seen to dramatically diverge from the
approaches used in traditional literary criticism. Electronic poetry offers
powerful possibilities for advances in the field of poetics; it has its own
fascinating aura inhabited by the ghosts of Edison, Marconi and countless
others; poets and poetry have so much to contribute to electronic
communication; I feel that specifically poetry and poetics are central to
the analysis and prevention of thought control by global corporatism and the
rapid rise of Big Brother language manipulations by governments. Poetic
usage of the cut-up technique helped free other arts from focusing
necessarily on a unitary image or theme. These techniques, especially in
their earliest incarnations gave readers (and still do, though possibly to a
lesser degree as they become incorporated into mainstream advertising and
literary products)  additional support in finding ways to defeat the numbing
effects of ever more manipulative methods of propaganda utilized in mass
media and in government supervised educational systems. We are now living in
a world as prophesied by Huxley and Orwell. Totalitarianism is on the rise
in our country and all over the world. Poetry is fun yet it has at least one
deadly serious purpose: to try to help save us from types of logic that kill
and enslave people. This brings me to Joel Weishaus' final question. What
makes an event a poem? For me, this has to do with what I feel is one of the
central purposes of poetry: just this- to confound the types of "rational
thinking" that are in reality harmfully manipulative and constrictive to
freedom of experience and thought. Novalis: "Poetry heals the wounds
inflicted by reason." And Dylan Thomas: "And death shall have no dominion/
dead men naked they shall be one/with the man in the wind and the west
moon/when their bones are picked clean and their clean bones gone/ they
shall have stars at elbow and foot/though they go mad they shall be sane/
though they sink through the sea they shall rise again/though lovers be lost
love shall not/and death shall have no dominion" (quoted from memory, so my
apologies for errors in quotation).

Chris Stroffolino asked me about listening to poetry and the ego effect. I
do think when listening to poetry we are better able to think more about the
music of the poem and to allow our thoughts to combine with the thoughts of
the poet. The poet's actual presence, in just voice or in voice and person,
in the best instances, allows us to paradoxically let the poet go; in that
sense, the presence of the poet' voice becomes the transitional object we
can hold onto while we can allow our thoughts to reach the regions of
thought and feeling that the poet is working to allow us access to. I think
the book can obviously allow for great freedom in appreciating poetry also;
but when I look at them I am frequently reminded of biographical aspects of
the poetry and I am more tempted to drift towards thinking about critical
judgment of the poet which often distorts the poet's intention in presenting
the poem, I think. I've noticed that when listening to poetry I can allow my
thoughts to better join in with those of the poet; I am enabled to think
less about how the poet has crafted the poem, how it holds together, etc. I
memorized the passage above quoted from Dylan Thomas listening to the famous
recording of this poem available on Caedmon Records. Peter Middleton and
others have written about the powerful effects of poetry readings in some
very useful essays in a book edited by Charles Bernstein: "Close Listening"
(Oxford).

Thanks to both of you for responding to my recent post on "Literary
Excellence" with these interesting questions.

i could cite articles and cites and on and on  but I looked at my
granddaughter this morning and realised my current project is recovery from
internet addiction.  This might be dismissed and you've probably stopped
reading but i realised that if I'm going to teach her how to ride a bicycle
I'll have to be able to ride myself and you don't learn how to ride again by
reading about how to do it.

same thinking applies to my work and my project, which is learning again to
write the poem I first babbled and a teacher told me it wasn't right.  (see
Will Alexander's piece in _The Third Mind: Creative Writing THROUGH Visual
Art).

My thanks to Wystan for so effectively pulling together some ideas and
threads. Although there were some interesting points made contrary to this
idea, I still think that Lewis Lacook's point is well taken. Throughout
poetry history certain specific poems do stand out as particularly powerful.
These are often the favorites repeated in anthologies like Stevens' "idea of
Order at Key West," Shelley's "Ozymandias", Keats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn,"
Coleridge's "Kubla Khan," certain poems by Emily Dickenson, Mathew Arnold's
poem "Dover Beach" ending with the famous line "where ignorant armies clash
by night". Many of these all time hits happen, I notice, to make very
powerful points that combine poetics and politics:  "beauty is truth, truth
beauty," "I am Oxymandias, King of Kings...the lone and level sands stretch
far away," "Where Alph the sacred river ran, down to a sunless sea,""O
blessed rage for order, pale Ramon." To focus on specific poems tends to
focus us on the truths they reveal about life and art. They become landmarks
in the process of poetic development, powerfully memorable efforts by
individual poets that lead to ways of thinking that help peel away the
seductive false smooth lies of self serving totalitarian doctrines and
government and mass media propaganda; all the ways that our overly
organized, obsessive-compulsive civilization wears away the ability to think
and feel for ourselves.

My apologies for any mistakes in references; I am still on vacation and away
from my books.

Hi Sheila

At one point in my life I considered each of my works to be part of one =
long work, e.g. the novels of Celine, Kerouac's Duluoz Legend, Whitman's =
Leaves of Grass. Now I'm not so sure. Over the past 20 years, I've =
expanded into too many areas to see how they all might fit together. My =
poetry started out as Black-Mountain-West Coast Beat but seems to be =
moving into a post langpo with vizpo elements. Most of my fiction is in =
an avant-pop/magical realism mode, but I still tend to write the =
occasional gritty realism piece. I have an unproduced play that's =
definitely gritty realism. And even my fusion of Black-Mountain-West =
Coast Beat poetry with free jazz isn't so simple, since I performed =
sections from my more langpo-oriented IMPROVISATIONS (I--XXIV) with free =
jazz opposite John Sinclair less than a year ago. My fingers have =

current attitude about whether my work is all one piece is "I'll know =

"My Great, Great, Great Grandfather, Josiah, Fights the Poney Gang"


"His toughest job was to lead the posse to clean up the Poney Gang, a group
of white trash hoodlums who robbed, raped, and murdered the other white
citizens.  With peace established, Josiah became a successful farmer."
- From an unpublished history of the Josiah Cowan York Sr. family by John
York Rumble

Eye on the blood pooling
Trying not to see the dead man’s dark cavities through his slack mouth
        (like a tunnelmouth where the road dives below rivers, bays, or cities
                (never liked dead faces  photos either
Blood between his forefinger and thumb rubbing it like a coin
        (how?  when?
Bowed floorboards popped up in places, dusty porch sloping towards the
southern exposure, dirt yard, dirt in the shack, dirt in their hair and
fingertips, now blood
        (like in Gone with the Wind
Woman too, and abused, neither armed
        (was the man kneeling?  "execution style" the papers say these days
                (he got them, of course, but how?

He: smoked a pipe
        (probably, a common practice for gentility and he was -- representative of
the law,
         blood of a revolutionary soldier, land/slaveowner
The Gang:  poor, white, couldn’t spell pony right
        (bad combination

I look for him at the reunion, in dark windows
(how?  no pictures, like repels like
I see some of me
but can’t put my fingers on him
        (as if touching makes the fiction real
The fingers of smoke in my lungs grew here,
geography he walked
        (erosion took his footprints -- I walk on turned earth two feet off
                (on account of continental shift
                        ("here" and "there" and "now" interchangeable

He got them, of course
        (posse, guns, oily torches letting loose gusts of flame
                (strange lynching white folk
                        (but how?
This story’s easy
        (with the dreamy edges of sitcom flashbacks
and weird because of the silly name
No Indian blood on the boots, no slave quarters out back
        (he did both:  made sure the Cherokee took the trail,
         raised a whip more than likely, somewhere out there darker cousins
This face there too though

For those who didn't catch it, most of what I've done and said has been in
jest.  Must we always be so earnest in our discussions on this list?  Must
the I always be the true I of the speaker? (If there is a true I.)

There are many ways of opening up topics for discussion.  There are many
ways of manipulating/performing/intervening.  Hasn't anyone ever tried them
out?  I imagine that most of us must be serious here because perhaps they
feel that they have a career at stake.

Yes, I meant some of what I said about Alan's method, but I also
exaggerated, took a point and pushed it, pushed it, pushed it. I also tried
to include some hint that all was not what it seemed.  In a sense, Alan is
this list's shared spectacle.

I want to thank Tom Bell for his quiet dicussions concerning this topic,
which I've been following.  Also his wonderful posting on Glazier's book!
Thanks for that!

Brandon blew my cover, but he went on to deliver some of the most
interesting explanations of what cyber-artists are doing.  Lewis' lecture
was also appreciated.

Why can't I "durst not go" where Alan goes?  Why the heck not?

As for Alan, I've noticed that many of his recent postings reflected
vocabulary from the list situation, so in a sense I've been his Muse.

Love,

Jesse

of Ch'ien-tzu wen, of the waist of language


"He perceives the base of infinite space as the base of infinite space.
Having perceived the base of infinite space as the base of infinite space,
he conceives [himself as] the base of infinite space, he conceives [him-
self] in the base of infinite space, he conceives [himself apart] from the
base of infinite space, he conceives the base of infinite space to be
'mine,' he delights in the base of infinite space. Why is that? Because he
has not fully understood it, I say." (Mulapariyaya Sutta: Sutta 1:15,
trans. Nanamoli, Bodhi)

K Angelo  A good link. The US and eg even Canada and any country that
stands for reason, peace or freedom of assembly, will get more of this.
This IS like the Vietnam war times contrary to the theses of Silliman =
and Perloff etal: its a continuation actually. These people who =
protested in Portland
are courageous. I know what its like: I was battoned by police here in =
NZ
in 1981 in the anti-Apartheid struggle which was like a war. But also I =
was
in the struggles in NZ anti the Vietnam War and some Maori  activist =
marches
nad also anti Nuclear:NZ (Aotearoa) opposes the US in the Nuclear area) =
hopefully pro peace....its terrifying and hard to go into these =
struggles...near
impossible ...  to stay calm: you also now have the Anti-Terroism Act =
which
is a way of controlling protest and freedom. Clinton was supportive of a
lot of bad shit but the Bushes take the cake. He should and his mates =
and Blair and the Israeli top dogs should  be tried and his father for =
genocide.=20

The US people need to struggle against the terrorist system set up by =
the capitlists that eg caused the deaths of 250,000 Pennsylvania miners =
since they began mining there and exploiting the working class there.

Wokers, People:People of the world unite!  Destroy Capitalism!

Arms manufacturers should be sued as tobacco comapies have been: arms =
manufacture should be ended: All countries must disarm. Otherwise we are =
heading for obliteration and more misery.  To attack Iraq is ludicrous: =
that country has been nearly decimated and Saddam Hussein is still very =
well thank you!=20

I  think it is way to easy to slap out a diagnosis or disorder  with some
kind of  disregard to what it  might mean in relationship to have
psychological system that has created convenient categories and then applies
them like tap water.  two in MPD the majority of the time each person or
individual does no know the other... one might want to read some of
Allucquere Stone's "The War of Desire and Technology at the Close of the
Mechanical age" for future insight on MPD.

Wow! Sorry to have knackered you out, Richard! Yes, well, downloading and installing Shockwave
can be a drag on some machines and connections, I realize.

I've put together a great links page, if you'd like to check out some fine work around the
world. It's at http://vispo.com/misc/links.htm . I've been building this page since 95, deleting
the odd link when I find the site doesn't exist anymore. The order of it is sloppily
chronological, mainly, according to when I came across the work. It's annotated so you get some
sense of where you're going, and whether it's primarily using this or that gizmo, usually, and
what I thought the main attractions were.

I tend to link out a lot in the essays I do at http://vispo.com/writings , also, and sometimes
also link out from within Shockwave or other gizmo work. I think a lot of us doing work for the
Web see part of what we are doing as trying to create a rich and meaningfully linked web of
related work that allows people to find their way around the world to exciting, international
net.work.

>one might want to read some of Allucquere Stone's "The War of Desire and
>Technology at the Close of the Mechanical age" for future insight on MPD.

My favorite is from one who has lived with MPD (or DID) for many years,
Madison Clell. She does an autobio comic, "Cuckoo." Here's some descriptive
stuff from her website <http://www.cuckoocomic.com>, which also includes
many pages from her comics:

Madison Clell is a Portland-based writer and artist who lives with a
condition known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (more commonly referred to
as Multiple Personality Disorder). She has published ten issues of an
autobiographical comics series titled Cuckoo.

Madison?s goal with Cuckoo is to shed some light on living with multiple
personality disorder. "If all you know about multiple personality disorder
is from Sybil and Three Faces of Eve, you probably don?t have a very human
picture of the condition," said Madison. "That?s why I write Cuckoo, to show
the what, how, where, why, and who of living as a multiple. The comics are
true stories ranging from the serious to the very silly?for example, how
does one deal with an alternate personality who only speaks Italian? How is
it possible to balance a checkbook when multiple bank accounts keep
mysteriously opening and closing? I present the material in an entertaining
fashion so that people want to read it?it?s a Trojan horse."

From author/illustrator Madison Clell:

Cuckoo started out as an elaborate sci-fi/fantasy world, generated inside my
seven-year-old mind and taking form as obsessive games and daydreams. Over
the years this fantasy developed an extensive plot and cast of characters,
some of whom seemed so tangible I believed they were real people. Every year
I vowed to record this world in "The Epic Novel"?having no idea how to begin
such a project, of course! From age seven onwards I made many attempts at
the novel, but always after either one page, or three, or twenty, I quit,
feeling frustrated and correctly assuming that my writing stank! When my
best friend introduced me to comic books, I decided to change "The Epic
Novel" into "The Epic Graphic Novel." I had no idea how to draw comics, but
blindly hoped if I read enough comic books and still slacked off learning
visual skills, this art form would be mastered though osmosis.

Thirteen years later, "The Epic Graphic Novel" by then engraved in the far
reaches of my skull, I entered therapy for hallucinations, flashbacks, lost
time, and speaking in strange voices. After a year of intensive therapy and
the usual denial over the diagnosis of Dissociative Identity Disorder, a
lightning bolt struck. My "Epic Graphic Novel," my "fantasy world," wasn't
make-believe at all! It was a gigantic metaphor for my fragmented,
dissociated mind, complete with alters cast as "fantasy characters" and
worlds where the power to erase the lives and memories of other people was
considered the ultimate weapon. After thirteen years of compulsive
make-believe, the Fantasy turned out to be REAL!

Cuckoo is the real-life "Epic Graphic Novel." Many wonderful people have
stuck their necks out for this project, and I've met and corresponded with
numerous multiples and "singleton" readers around the world. As a result of
years in therapy, and creating these comics, I am now almost integrated.

My tremendous thanks go to all who have helped, all who have reached out and
written me, and everyone who has shown an interest in Cuckoo. Your
participation has been and will continue to be appreciated far more than you
know.

Cuckoo will continue to be published until "The Epic Story" is finished.

Nick:

Indeed poetry can have an effect larger than only on the circle of its
practitioners. Are we lacking in educating the media and the public as to
the relevance poems may have to a democracy? When we get a rare opportunity,
as, for example, Robert Pinsky does on PBS, we fail "to confound the types
of  'rational thinking' that are in reality harmfully manipulative and
constrictive to freedom of experience and thought," as you say.

Several of you have written to say you've had the same experience, i.e.
receiving suspicious files apparently, but not really, from Listmembers. I
don't know much about computer systems but I wonder if anything can be done
to block this. I suppose we're OK if we just don't open files - but it's
annoying.

chris, tenney, others:

in an interview i asked clark coolidge "So how do you see the name
functioning in your work? Typically for the New York School, the name is
a reference to a community of friends and poets; it also sort of fixes
the work in a particular moment in time."

he responded: "Well, somewhat that way, and also maybe even more so in
just an imaginative way, what names of well-known people do to your
brain: movie stars, writers, politicians. And then also made-up names. It
isn't very far from some of the famous names to just altering them a
little bit and changing them to someone that doesn't exist. I suppose
there's an almost fictional desire to sort of invent people....Plus
naming is just so basic, and maybe really basic to what poetry is."

Hey Guys --

I just clicked on the button at the EPC for Ed Foster's Talisman, out of
Jersey, but the web site the button took me to was the quite different
Talisman Press out in Santa Barbara (where I live when I'm not at the
office in PA!) -- I've seen this confusion before, but EPC needs to correct
this right away --

Does anybody know if Foster's TALISMAN has released THE WORLD IN TIME AND
SPACE yet?

Aldon,

The book is either just out, or almost on the way. As for the Talisman
site...it's currently undergoing a complete overhaul (I'm working on it), &
should be updated & looking snazzy quite soon. URL is

Dear Patrick Herron:


It has come to my attention that you like to join lists just so you can talk
to yourself in public.  Maybe you consider your writing more authentic if
you respond to people who see you as irrelevant or worse.

Far be it from you to be discouraged by your absenting from discourse.  Oh
no.  You feel it is your need to make sociopathy appear to be an occasion
for conical birthday hats or prone canines juggling howler monkeys.  You can
defend the overposted, the ignored, and the belligerent all you want.  You
can post poems that operate with rules that are neither quite organic nor
algorithmic.  Those are much less than boring.  You can post political
journalism but you forget you are simply being negative or that 10,000
Francophiles can quote pseudophilosophical crap establishing the utter
hopelessness about change.  Ah, "change," a cute concept for the desperately
naive!  You can insist that proper names are an occasion for becoming
properly pissed.  You can design websites but no one knows what the fuck you
are talking about.  It is painfully clear that you are not talking about
anything relevant.  Pink web pages, pal?  Somebody back me up here!

You can attend readings, performances and publish in journals.  Be rest
assured that no one listens, no one reads.  You can write books, but clearly
they are unfocused, disparate, unworthy of white whale status.  That one
time we bothered to glance at you, you were not there.  Let's be honest.
You will never be.  We see right through you.  Your art stinks.

Writing is no mirror; it is not sufficient for reflection.  Neither are you
sufficient.  Though, of course, I'd like to have sex with you.  But only
when you are dead and your bone is ash.  You are a vapid fraud formed from
vapor.  Ah, to heckle the dead and buried!  It is your most worthy remark. A
mirror is not when dark.

What's worse, you write letters to yourself on this list, wasting bandwidth
and people's time in an apparent attempt to draw even more attention to
yourself, to maybe sucker some people into delivering some pity to you.
Ranting on and on with self-abuse and disregard.  As if pity is a worthy
remedy for a lack of attention.  Forget it.  Push your shopping cart out of
here.  Or stay here.  Cheap tricks.  I do not care.  Even in your
ephemerality you are frightfully pathetic.  Your mirrors consume themselves
into wisps of nothing.


Patrick Herron
patrick@proximate.org


PS: You might help your reality if you attend graduate school.  Especially
if it gives you the opportunity to spend 20-30K a year reading the horrible
doctoral dissertations your professors excused into book form and sloughed
off as serious criticism.  It will make you someone, maybe even a published
poet.

PSS: Don't tell anyone that I wrote you.  Thanks.

Could somebody give me examples of classical translations by contemporary
experimental poets? I can't think of any off the top of my head, to be
honest. The most recent one that comes to mind is L Zukofsky's Catullus, but
I am sure there must be something after that, yes? If not, then why? Has
experimental poetry finally silenced this oft-exploited link with past
voices and traditions?

Going back to something that George Bowering said earlier about his work
being Kaballistic.  What 20th century--contemporary poets use Kaballistic
(or Christian Quabbalistic) refs. in their work?

Jerome Rothenberg is one.
Yeats

any others?

Jesse, I have Paul Knight's translation in which the section you refer to
appears as number 8 of Book 4.  Knight has it as "Every night, swooping with
the vast span of my wings into the death-throes of my memory . . . ," and his
rendition evinces no cut up technique.  Sounds like you have the more
interesting text.  It's surely possible that Knight went about straightening
out the room.  Unfortunate.  It makes sense to me that "Isi" Ducasse deranged
his texts, both the one he lived and the one he wrote (one and the same?)
Best, Bill

could you perhaps describe more specifically what you
mean by "experimental poetry"?


(I am aware that the term may be very clear for many
members of this list .... but believe that a
discussion of this very interesting topic would
benefit from an exploration of the term).

Michael,

I assume you don't only mean Greeks or Romans. Armand Schwerner and Sue
Landers have translations of Dante (and great ones at that). john Taggart
translated passages from aeschylus. Richard Sieburth has a very interesting
treatment of Holderlin's "a Map of Mnemosyne," which is holderlin's attempt
to translate the Greek spirit into German. Ben Friedlander has work
(translations) in Holderlin style. Holderlin seems to be the key path for us
both to the Greeks and also to the East (through the Persian sufi poet Hafiz).

Then there are Andrew Schelling's translations of classical indian erotic
poetry and my translations of the 13th century Turkish sufi poet Yunus Emre
and 16th century poet pir Sultan...

i think interest in classical poetry is very strong among some poets today,
but the scope of that classism is much wider.

Best.

Hm. I will get to your question in a moment. But first a bit of the
backstory -


I guess my question arose when I began to think about how somebody like
Clark Coolidge (unquestionably an experimental poet, I think it's fair to
say) would go about translating a classical author like Hesiod or Firdusi
etc. Since I couldn't even imagine how it would come about, I began to
ponder whether the age of poets translating old texts like these was finally
over with the generation(s?) of Zukofsky and Pound, at least among cutting
edge experimental poets of Coolidge's ilk. I may be wrong in my assumption,
but if so, I am interested in hearing why. Why doesn't the challenge of
translation seem to appeal to experimental poets anymore? Has it died and
been handed over to the academics, or is something else amiss?

As to what defines experimental poetry, who knows? I can only cite examples.
I would say that Ashbery on forward is arguably what demarcates the
experimental, more or less. Could anybody see Ashbery translating Ovid?
Ashbery has sometimes translated in his own way modern poets like Craven who
have an aesthetic alliance of sorts with him, but how might he handle
something in an ancient, alienated past? I leave this as an open question.

and i'm interested to know what you mean by "translation."
i've been re-reading Rational Geomancy, and the first third or so of the book
investigates translation as a poetic act, so i've got translation on the brain,
and i seem to see it everywhere.
In the sense that nichol & mccaffery use it there-

"the act of organizing space, semiotic balances and the emotional weight
between word-objective-phenomena; .. the modification of pressures in and among
words..."

 i think it might be safe to say that Rob Fitterman translates parts of
Petrarch's Dialogues in Metropolis 16-29.

Of related interest:

1. Frank Bidart, _Desire_ (FSG, 1997); _Music Like Dirt_ (Sarabande, 2002).  His retelling of Ovid's Myrrha story in _Desire_ is a masterpiece.

2. Christopher Logue's ongoing _War Music_.  The latest installment, a battle scene in the _Iliad_, is in the summer issue of _The Threepenny Review_ (along with an interesting essay on Bidart's classicism by Rosanna Warren).

In the chapbook _Music Like Dirt_, Bidart focuses on the metaphysical and emotional contradictions of poiesis.  He centers, for example, on the fact that artists' avidity for making is always linked to their dissatisfaction with what they have made.  Because art is the static, "finished" imitation of fluid praxis, its triumph--to have embodied life as if for all time--is also a source of pain to the artist, whose urge to go on making does not cease, cannot cease.  This poem, "Hammer," focuses on an impossible wish that works of art might also embody their own destruction.  A poet's poet's poem:

        Hammer

        The stone arm raising a stone hammer
        dreams it can descend upon itself.

        When the quest is indecipherable,--
        ...what is left is a career.

        What once was apprehended in passion
        survives as opinion.

        To be both author of
        this statue, and the statue itself.

I think both Bidart and Logue are among the most interesting contemporary poets to have drawn material from Greek and Roman sources.

I think the idea was that the poet would be experimental and recent,
and that the work translated would be classical.

this is kind of a weird winnowing process, I think.  I assume, for example,
that Ed Sanders would be considered either not experimental enough or not
poetical enough or the Chekov he 'translates' be in spirit and not in
"verse" so successfully eliminated from consideration?

I am not trying to winnow anybody out, but I am particularly interested in
seeing how far out translation can be pushed and still be considered
translation, which is why I stress the experimental side of this.
Traditional translations are not terribly valuable to me in this regard as
they follow the standard rules, although they may be perfectly fine in every
other respect. I want to hear about the weird, crazy possibilities and
actualities, like LZ's Catullus. I am not interested in drawing up a
syllabus on the topic, only in stimulating new ideas and seeing where they
lead.

It seems to me that many experimental poets, and the language poets in
particular, often deal with words as fixed objects for manipulation instead
of seeing them as being something that can get mapped onto something else in
a variety of ways. (Translation being one of those ways.) That is, you often
find poets treating words as harvestable markers in a database, etc. instead
of as dynamic, topologically transformable entities. What I am hoping the
discussion of translation will ultimately lead to is to raise the issue of
what is a word and how does it function, especially within a textual entity
that is the direct translation of another entity that is also made of words.
Are the one-dimensional word qua object-based techniques of today's
experimental poets limiting their options vis a vis the way a text can
intersource with other texts? These are the kinds of questions I am grasping
at. (Maybe still rather badly at this stage.)

I think it's an interesting project as you describe it.

1. How does this fit in with what Ron posted re 'sans verbs'?

2.  I consider myself somewhat of an experimental poet in the sense that I
do like to experiment but see that more as coming from translations I've
done and influencing me experimentation rather than vice versa?  This is not
completely lucid to me at the moment but I feel like I learned to pick out
and manipulate words and concepts in space and order, etc. either from the
way I was trained as a translator or the first work I did which was as a
voice intercept operator listening in to Russian tanks on manoever, etc.
There might be an interesting clue in me and other students realizing we
were dreaming in Russian and it would appear related to the type of
instruction we got which was we basically spent 8 hours a day 'in Russia' or
at least exclusively speaking it.

3.  The translation issue I'm intrigued by at the moment is helping native
speakers of other languages put their English (which tend to be very good
but perhaps'academic' or arcane) into something that makes sense for anglo
academic and/or practitioner audiences (audiences?).   For example, this was
my role with Dmirti Bulatov for his two anthologies and here it was
compounded since many of the articles he either translated first into
Russian (or in many cases had it done) before were 'translated' from Russian
into English.  i do regret that I didn't have the time to do more than what
I would consider a 'passable' job on this.

probably more than you wanted to know but I'm in the mood today.

the label 'experimental poet' has been used in the past to
marginalize, along with performance poet, ethnic poet etc. anyone who
is not a 'serious' poet or 'canon' poet.

poetry for me is one big experiment with words/language.

Davenport has an interesting bhook called Eclogues after Virgil's. I wanted
to get hold of it but it's hard to get Davenport's work outside the Uni
Libraries in NZ. But that's one I know. Richard Taylor (Aotearoa)

Then there's Kent Johnson - The Miseries of Poetry - see below. I've read
the text and quite quite liked it (see below) - Alan

We have all always desired the eyeless goddess, the handsome
whore-boy,
the Megala Louloudia.  Here they are.  Ever since the cache was
discovered
at Montazah Palace, we=92ve been waiting for translations suitable
for
Greek menus everywhere.  Had the Greeks invented fortune
cookies, they
could not have foretold the strange beauty of these versions.

I'm doubled over by the Miseries of Poetry, folded into a mirror
world of literature and here live on moth-ambrosia, play happily
with
possible ancillas of the Pre-Socratics. --

Like the Jews, if Kent Johnson didn't exist, someone would have
to invent
him. His mind leaks nomads constantly naming world-historic
hinges as if
inscription were always underfoot. You can't pull Catullus out of
the
'incubated / god, writing himself into being' but you can pull the
door
open. Literature is close to fraud, evanescent and trembling in
these times of
incipient terror. Johnson's approach deconstructs and
exacerbates that
fraud; I think of his work as returning to the (re)creation of
language -
political and sexual language, the languages of the last people
speaking
on earth.

-Alan Sondheim


If they ever need a Classics Geek on "Beat the Geeks," Dr.
Kent Johnson is
their man. The Miseries of Poetry is an operatically nerdy
intervention
in the transmission of ancient lyric, a scurrilous, fantastical,
erudite,
shameless, and often very moving addition to the Geek--er,
Greek--Anthology. More faithful in its peregrinate Sapphic
incontinence than most of the
last two centuries of vanilla-flavored translations, this sheaf of
cracked-amphora smut will change the way people misinterpret
Linear B
forever.  Roll over, Richmond Lattimore: this is not your father's
Mimnermus.

-Kasey Silem Mohammad


In the realm of ethics the ends rarely justify the means; in the
realm of art they always do. This complex translation by
Alexandra Papaditsas and Kent Johnson is flamboyant,
provocative, and brilliant. In three or four thousand years, when
English has long sounded more Asian than European, The
Miseries of Poetry will no doubt be inciting tremendous passions
at the KGB Bar.

=2E.still...moisture on the long
papyrus fragments, vivid
charm and cultural
codes transposed
on a spit the
tang of the Johnson mystagogus,
with live voice on quitch-grass
carnal and refined,
the then swag of buddhistic
pomegranites, the bull-leapers..

-Lissa Wolsak


In The Miseries of Poetry, which court(s) opprobrium as a
slanted form
of cultural capital, violent mannerism is at war with erudite
imagination.
Neither wins. Read it to behold their struggle and moments of
startling
poetry.

-Nada Gordon


A pair of fabled translators politely ambushes us with a rich and
randy
trove of ancient papyri with a dicey provenance. Here the real is
imbedded
in the unreal, the imaginary in the factual. Lacunae appear where
there
were none, and credible texts, adeptly contemporized, where
there were
holes. The holes themselves are deliciously elaborated. Once the
reader is
urged to fall, "Fall, orangely, to the ground" resistance, in a single
adverb, is dispelled.

-C.D. Wright


When Frank, Kenneth, Jimmy and I were young, the
idea of forgery
was a kind of coal to make us go very fast: We
shoveled it,
hungrily, into the bellowing fire, and the speed of our
engine became often
quite fantastic. There were no rules in that magical
land; the backs of
our chairs were turned against the sun, and
sometimes we would
get this overwhelming feeling of exaltation. Now,
suddenly, we are
here at this station, and one wonders, frankly,
what has happened.
"Avant-garde" poetry, whatever it is, like Amtrak
rail travel, so clickety-
clack, so predictable and slow... May I suggest
that Alexandra Papaditsas
be canonized as a saint of translation, and the cast
of her horned head
placed like a warning above the door of The
Academy of American Poets.

-John Ashbery


What a strange debt of gratitude we owe to Kent Johnson and
his
co-translator, the perpetually-betrayed and haplessly goat-
horned
Alexandra Papaditsas (now deceased). In The Miseries of
Poetry they
bring us versions from the Greek that are at once bafflingly
poignant,
shriekingly funny, and far lovelier than they have any right to be,
especially in light of their vexed provenance. These are poems
full of
mystery and buggery, flying in from an unmapped world on thin
gold wings.

-Rachel Loden


Kent Johnson's Miseries probes our own relation with ancient
Greek
musicks, which for most of us are only ever received through
"translation." In so doing, he celebrates and tweaks the
permeability
of that membrane we call "self" or "author-ity." Who is alive and
who
is not, now? Are you alive, reader? The arguments and
skirmishes of a
translator are, perhaps, "the miseries of poetry." And, in this,
though translation might be always a "weird extrinsic
appendage," we
like it, we crave it, for it's also "love's ultimate excrescence into
joy."

O to be struck by lightning
And have a horn sprout
>From the middle of your forehead!
Kent Johnson & Alexandra
Papaditsas, may the ancient
Greeks forgive you.  And us.

-John Bradley


>From the halls of Carl Rakosi's objectivism to the shores of Dr.
Kinbote's cretian textual labyrinths come the conquering soldier boys of
Alexandra Papaditsas and Kent Johnson's translations. What too but the pith
and vinegar of Brautigan and Koch, the pint-sized minotaur farting in the
center of these inventions and oh we can't forget the horn, no, on
Alexandra Papaditsas' head: that horn of plenty on which Kent Johnson
impaled himself and rode up and down the alleyways of Thylakis groaning
and drunk. Yes, I think that "objectionable" is the best term for such poem=
s.
In fact, as with all great works of art, this book is utterly tasteless.

I spent a careless youth looting ancient sites in West Texas, taking
artifacts and shards to decorate my bookcase and bedroom. Later I
discovered the volumes of LITERARY PAPYRII in the Loeb Series, and stole
the fragmented  images shamelessly. We each translate the world we find
ourselves in-- it is the only way we can understand the void. Nothing
whole remains. Even the universe is incomplete.  If Papaditsas believes it
was Romans who destroyed Alexandria, let it be. Though all the Emperor
Caracalla did in reply to satires was massacre the inhabitants in 215 CE.
It was 'Amir the Arab who is said to have burnt the Library
there in 640
CE, though that too is not exactly correct. Just like these poems,
and the
universe entire. And ourselves, wretched readers. But what
beauty and
astonishment remains!
