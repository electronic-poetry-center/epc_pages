ya know yes i'm new to list relatively and i thank david for that
consideration and dear friend jonathan too
and those like richard and mary jo for their support
but if i had been on for 1 or 10 yrs i still would have posted the
backchannel
it's part of POETICS to challenge one and study one and dissect one and
discuss one and ones's work
and i wasn't some much disturbed as amused and i thought well since he is
panning me and
my work so "viciously" playfully and comicaly (sp) without even knowing
me he should do it in public so we can all learn something and if he
wants my work to grow he should offer suggestions that maybe we could all
profit by so maybe it would help me see the errors of my WAY  (oh by the
way a couple of errors in bathroom death and it is now edited slightly)
rather than just scare the roaches when they turned this damned machine
on that night

and yes richard i learned from everything out there except school
and shit as i said in a recent pome

a sestina abandoned me after 2 lines

backchanneling should maybe come w/ a warning  like earthquake before

I met a lot of people through Tom, mainly through the reading series he
ran at the QE2. I know I met Gerry Schwartz, David Kirschenbaum, Alan
Catlin & Paul Weinman there. He was real active politically, to the
core--and between him, Dan Wilcox, Charlie Rossitter and all the punk
rock running through the place there was a DIY thing that started me
into publishing, DAK's Boog also, I would guess. Tom was radical in a
goofy fun way, bringing instruments to readings in the homeless park,
making people read Whitman's Leaves of Grass non-stop start to finish,
trying to get us all to wear a bunch of neon streamers and parade
through the city, reading at the AIDS quilt at the NYS museum but still
retaining a sense of balance, rather than the reeling anguish we were
feeling in the late 80's at the time. Tom was always energetically into
the poetry, yet threw the best shindigs for whomever was passing through
in tribute to their work.  Tom did a lot of work toward causes to show
how important they were to him, from introducing the rest of the US to
his favorite Albany through readings in other states with 3 guys (he did
New Albany, Ohio, here), to attacking hydro electric power plants as a
pamphleteer, hiroshima anniversary readings against the bomb & all else.
He wasn't afraid to mix poetry and politics, to use it to teach, even
during a gap of time when it was thoroughly unfashionable.

I do know, as does Homeland Security and the State Department, that my
file is empty. The Patriot Act was put forward as an excuse and I was
asked to reapply. Since then, there has been total silence. Why was this
decision taken? What are you afraid of? Is it perhaps that academic
freedom of expression has become a danger for you? Or is it perhaps the
fact that it would have fortified criticism against you, no matter how
constructive, especially coming from a Muslim intellectual?... I finally
decided not to try settling in your country anymore. I am not sure what,
during this second mandate, could rid you of this Manichean view and
dangerous interpretation of the world.


Open letter to President George W. Bush

 From an "expelled" Muslim to an elected American
Tariq Ramadan

Mr. President,

By a strange twist of fate, this year's calendar puts your inauguration
on the same day as the most important religious day of the year for
Muslims. Is it a historical irony that links these two celebrations
together? As you are inaugurated for your second term, I, a European
Muslim, want to share with you a few thoughts.

Mr. President, I was banished from the United States by your
administration. My visa was revoked, as I was about to assume my
position as a Professor at Notre Dame University. To this day, I have
not been told the reasons behind this action.

I do know, as does Homeland Security and the State Department, that my
file is empty. The Patriot Act was put forward as an excuse and I was
asked to reapply. Since then, there has been total silence. Why was this
decision taken? What are you afraid of? Is it perhaps that academic
freedom of expression has become a danger for you? Or is it perhaps the
fact that it would have fortified criticism against you, no matter how
constructive, especially coming from a Muslim intellectual?

What are you doing to your country, Mr. President?

Along with the majority of Muslims around the world, I condemned the
September 11 attacks. I shared and sympathized with the American
people's pain. We understood their fears and the depth of their doubts.
To transcend that traumatic experience, two things were crucial. First,
Muslims had to firmly and clearly denounce terrorism and extremism,
which they did, even if at times it was done timidly. Second, the
American government should have shed light on the facts: how were such
odious acts possible? Who was responsible for the multiple and repeated
information failures? The people of the United States, like the rest of
the world, needed explanations, transparency and truth.

However, since September 11th, 2001 your administration has continued to
accumulate shadowy dealings. Boards of inquiry were delayed or strangely
constituted; state secrets and sinister silences mushroomed. In the name
of the "war against terrorism", the ultimate reason for legitimacy, did
you permit your officials to make decisions and to act illegitimately,
without a hint of accountability? Under your watch, laws eradicating
civil liberties have been enacted which put into question the rights of
citizens. Discrimination against Arabs and Muslimshas been
institutionalized and legalized. There is limitless scrutiny,
individuals are arrested, and lying in the name of the State has become
the norm.

Whatever the tone of your generous speeches, facts do not lie: this is
not a good time to be a Muslim in the United States. The consequences of
the Patriot Act has been exactly what its' most virulent detractors had
predicted - an infringement of citizens' rights and legalized
discrimination that is reminiscent of the McCarthy era.

Your commitment on the international stage is no less alarming. Your
intervention in Afghanistan killed thousands of civilians who had
nothing to do with the attacks of September 11th. The situation is
unresolved. Bin Laden is still a fugitive and tortures exerted by those
under your administration are a daily happening as confirmed by Human
Rights Watch.

Inhumane treatment inflicted on the Guantanamo prisoners in a declared
"no rights" area is scandalous. Your intervention in Iraq only confirmed
these practices, characterized by lies, systematic manipulation and in
the end, the death of tens of thousands of Iraqis and Americans. The
horrors of Abu Ghuraib prison, which appeared as revelations of torture
were in fact institutionalized, from Afghanistan to Guantanamo. The
American soldiers in Iraq are not primarily responsible: someone at the
head of your administration had undoubtedly given the green light. Mr.
Bush, would it be that you are in favour of torture exerted against
Arabs and Muslims? Is this the message that one must understand from
these actions?

For the last three years, your policy has consisted in victimizing the
American super power to such an extent that in return, it has had total
disrespect for basic human rights. Instead of calming spirits with more
truth and dialogue, you have spread fear by keeping Americans in the
dark and lying to them. It was expected that you would assist in
surpassing the trauma of September 11th, not sustain it dangerously. You
have won the elections by feeding the fears of your citizens and
presenting yourself as their only guarantor of security. You won by
playing on emotions, not intelligence.

Mr. President,

I have visited the United States more than twenty times in the past
three years. I know that your country abounds with people of critical
intelligence and honesty. Many of your citizens are not easily deceived.
They are not only ashamed of the image you give of your country but,
more deeply, of the way in which you are transforming it into a citadel
besieged by fear and arrogance.

As a European Muslim, frightened by your unilateralism and the serious
excesses of your policies, it is towards worthy and critical American
citizens that I invite Muslims to turn to and to bring together their
hopes. If the Muslims are right in not trusting you, they should not
confuse the American people with the increasingly blunt spirits that
surround you.

It's been a couple of weeks that you have made your support for the
victims of the Tsunami disaster public in order to show Muslims that you
were capable of compassion and that you respected them. At the heart of
this natural disaster, aware of the desolation and deaths, know Mr.
President, that these Muslims remain lucid. You will not gain their
trust through emotions.

Your second mandate begins January 20th. You presented yourself to the
American people as the solution but you are in fact the problem. You
have not ceased to deepen the gap between the United States and the rest
of the world - not only the Muslim world but also Europe. As a European
Muslim, I had the hope that by relocating to your country, I would have
been able to bring a critical and constructive contribution. Your
administration preferred to exclude me, like so many other Muslim
intellectuals, in order to protect itself from debate and dialogue.

I finally decided not to try settling in your country anymore. I am not
sure what, during this second mandate, could rid you of this Manichean
view and dangerous interpretation of the world. I do not know what could
persuade you to use less lies and more truths.

I know simply that the Muslims celebrate on this 20th of January, a
faith, which they consider stronger, then your capriciousness. If with
strength of conscience and intelligence, they succeed in distinguishing
between your administration and the American people and continue to
dialogue with those of your fellow-citizens who have not been blinded,
then hope remains. That is the only hope, unless you are touched by
grace and that you understand that it is urgent, for the good of our
planet, that you change your policies.

That's very interesting, Ishaq. I visited  http://www.ilaam.net/sub.asp and
read the Christian Science Monitor and New York Times articles on the story
of Tariq Ramadan's USA passport having been revoked.

I note that there are various mentions in the NY Times article that he is
considered "a wolf in sheep's clothing" by various people:

"Lee Smith, who writes about Arab culture, pronounced Mr. Ramadan a "quieter
and gentler" jihadist in The American Prospect last March. And earlier this
fall, two Middle East scholars, Daniel Pipes and Fouad Ajami, portrayed the
Swiss intellectual in op-ed articles as a dissembler and a wolf in sheep’s
clothing."

Though we also read that "the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs in Chicago
expressed "deep concern" that the unexplained visa revocation was "one more
horrific example of government suspicion, intimidation and exaggerated
allegations against Muslims and Muslim communities."" And that he does not
advocate violence, for instance. It seems unlikely that he is "a wolf in
sheep's clothing"--and certainly he is *not* "quiet", which seems to be the
main issue. From what I read, he is a challenging but compassionate
intellectual. His challenges seem measured, from what I read.

What do you make of the situation and him, Ishaq?

Thanks guys.

That's more or less what I meant, but I would also refer to someone who
learned poetics outside of the academic system, gained a reputation
there, and THEN went back to school for the degree & teaching career as
a "townie."

Do other people use different definitions?

I would be one of those.
Spent 15 years as a professional performance poet and school writing
workshop facilitator.
Published 6 books of poetry before i read a word of theory, or =
considered
poetics in a formal sense.
Found the computer and literary theory and new media theory and a whole
bunch of other theories in 1993,1994,1995 onwards.
I'm still here.
I like poetry, i like theory and i like argument, just like you. But =
what
i've found on the list is that there are a lot of cowboys and cowgirls =
that
are out to make a name for themselves, by attacking poets/townies (as =
you
call them) who have an established reputation.
Why submit posts when someone wants a shoot-out, pardner.

Hi Folks,

March starts off with a number of major events for Talon including a
conference honoring our author Frank Davey: Poetics and Public Culture at the
University of Western Ontario. Readers, Presenters and Speakers at the Conference
include Frank - who will be launching his new book 'Back to the War' 0-88922-514-1
with a public reading on March 3, George Bowering, Jeff Derksen, Daphne
Marlatt, Fred Wah, Adeena Karasick and bill bissett.

On March 2 Adeena Karasick will be doing the Canadian premier of her
homolinguistic trans'elation of the Sefer Yetzirah (the Kabbalistic Book of Creation)
at the Drake Hotel's Underground Lounge in Toronto from 7:30-9:30. The
performance will include music and projections and a guest appearance by bill
bissett. Both bill and Adeena will also be performing that week at the Grey Borders
Reading series in St Catharines on March 1 and at the Exchange Rate Reading
Series in Buffalo on March 4.

On March 2 BRAVO! TV will be premiering 'George Ryga: Poliical Playwright' at
8:00pm an hour long documentary on one of Canada's and Talon's best known and
best-selling playwrights, author of that staple of Canadian drama backlist
The Ecstasy of Rita Joe 0-88922-000-X and our recently published 'The Other
Plays' 0-88922-500-1 and Prairie Novels 0-88922-501-X. This is a much anticipated
documentary that should help rekindle interest in this great Canadian
playwright.

In early April Talon will be undertaking two mammoth promotions on opposite
sides of the country. In Vancouver the AWP Conference will be occuring and on
April 1 (see attachment) Talon will be presenting a reading and reception of 10
of our most illustrious authors and poets: bill bisset, George Bowering,
Colin Browne, Marie Clements, Frank Davey, MAC (Marian) Farrant, Adeena Karasick,
Daphne Marlatt, Jamie Reid and Fred Wah. We expect it will be the Canadian
literary event of the conference. There will also be a public reading of these
same authors and those of some of our colleagues at FC2 (fiction collective 2)
distributed by Northwestern University Press which will be a benefit for the
RAW Exchange reading series at the Vancouver Public Library. Date, time and
venue have yet to be confirmed but it will likely be at the Crush Champagne Lounge
1180 Granville Ave on March 31 from 7:00-10:00pm.

At the same time in Montreal at Blue Metropolis Steve Galluccio author of
Mambo Italiano  0-88922-494-3 the most popular play in Montreal history and soon
to be a long running ongoing show a la the Mousetrap will be performing in a
series of readings and panel discussions at the Festival. Thierry Hentsch will
also be participating in a public lecture and discussion of the issues raised
by his book Truth or Death 088922-509-5. There will be launches of both
Martine Desjardins new novel All that Glitters 088922-520-6 and Mary Meigs' Beyond
Recall 088922-505-2 which will include a memorial to Mary.

All in all 14 of our writers representing over 40 different Talon titles will
be appearing in Canada during this first week of April. We hope you will help
us support these great writers as they launch us into the Spring of 2005 and
National Poetry Month.

from todays Washington Post:

Irene Pepperberg, a comparative psychologist at Harvard's Radcliffe

thinking -- even grasping something akin to the sophisticated concept

Bird Brains Get  Some New Names,  And New Respect

  By Rick Weiss

   Their plumage can be beautiful, and many warble or sing. A few even
seem kind of clever, in their way. But for all that is impressive about
birds, most people would agree: "Brainy" they are not.

  Now science is about to set the record straight. And the truth may be
jarring for all those big-brained mammals for whom the very word for
avian gray matter has come to mean "dummy."

  Today an international group of experts is publishing a call for
scientists around the world to switch to a new set of words to describe
the various parts of the avian brain -- a wholesale revision of terms
that is rarely seen in science and the first total makeover of bird
brain anatomy in more than a century.

  The new system, which draws upon many of the words used to describe
the human brain and has broad support among scientists, acknowledges
the now overwhelming evidence that avian and mammalian brains are
remarkably similar -- a fact that explains why many kinds of bird are
not just twitchily resourceful but  able to design and manufacture
tools, solve mathematical problems and, in many cases, use language in
ways that even chimpanzees and other primates cannot.

  In particular, it reflects a new recognition that the bulk of a bird's
brain is not, as scientists once thought, mere "basal ganglia" -- the
part of the brain that simply coordinates instincts. Rather, fully 75
percent of a bird's brain is an intricately wired mass that processes
information in much the same way as the vaunted human cerebral cortex.

  Accordingly, under the new system, no longer will a part of that avian
cortex-like region be referred to as the "archistriatum," with its
Latin root that implies primitive. As of today it is the "arcopallium,"
which means, in effect, "arched structure in a cognitively
sophisticated area."

  "It's the opposite of sticks and stones -- names do matter when it
comes to how scientists and other people think about things," said Duke
University neuroscientist Erich Jarvis, a leader of the Avian Brain
Nomenclature Consortium, whose manifesto appears in the February issue
of the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience.

  The old system, Jarvis said, stunted scientists' imaginations when it
came to appreciating birds' brainpower. The new system revamps about 95
percent of the 1,000 or so terms that scientists use to describe avian
brain structure.

  "It's long overdue," said Evan Balaban, a behavioral neuroscientist at
McGill University in Montreal. "Changing a name by itself may not seem
earth-shattering, but it reflects an important change in knowledge."

  The problem goes back to the  19th century, when German naturalist
Ludwig Edinger did the first careful studies of avian neuroanatomy and
labeled the myriad parts of the bird brain. He had a good eye for
detail, Jarvis said. But he was trapped in the political and religious
thinking of his day, which presumed that evolution is a process that
goes from simplest to more complicated and from dumber to smarter, all
culminating in the appearance of  humans, who  were seen as closest to
God.

  In keeping with that view, Edinger's naming system relied heavily on
prefixes  such as "paleo" and "archi" to indicate the primordial nature
of the bird's brain. Similar structures can be found near the core of
"higher" animals' brains -- leftovers, it was believed, from
evolutionary history. But they were covered by what were believed to be
newer layers of smarter material  such as the human "neocortex."

  Edinger was unaware that the first birds did not appear on Earth until
50 million to 100 million years after the earliest, supposedly "neo"
mammals. He also got fooled by the fact that the large portion of bird
brain devoted to higher processing of visual and auditory information
-- the part equivalent to the human cerebral cortex -- has a neural
architecture that makes it look, at first, like the simpler regions
that deal with instinctive behaviors.

  Like many people today, Edinger had little reason to question the
conclusion that birds had meager intellects, said  Tony Reiner, a
University of Tennessee neuroscientist and a member of the consortium.

   "Pigeons bob their heads while they walk, which makes them look like
morons, and so people assumed birds only have the moron part of the
brain," Reiner said. "People thought they were stuck with just the
instinct part."

  In recent decades, however, several avenues of evidence have proved
otherwise. Studies of brain chemicals, neural connections and genetic
controls over embryonic brain development have shown that the vast bulk
of a bird's admittedly small brain is not "primitive" at all but rather
constitutes a robust "pallium," or higher-processing center.

  And behavioral studies in recent years have proved that many birds
have more pallium power than your average mammal.

  Even seemingly moronic pigeons can categorize objects as "human-made"
vs. "natural"; discriminate between cubistic and impressionistic styles
of painting; and communicate using visual symbols on computers,
according to evidence compiled by the consortium, which spent seven
years on the project with input from scientists around the world.

  Some birds can play games in which they intentionally tell lies. New
Caledonian crows design and make tools. Scrub jays can recall events
from specific times or places -- a trait once thought unique to humans.
And perhaps most impressive, parrots, hummingbirds and thousands of
other species of songbirds are able to teach and learn vocal
communication -- the basic skill that makes human language possible.
That's a variant of social intelligence not found in any mammal other
than people, bats, and cetaceans such as dolphins and whales.

  In recognition of such sophistication, the group deleted all prefixes,
suffixes and other linguistic features that implied evolutionary
precedence, superiority or inferiority. In their place the group offers
value-free words that tell, for example, where a structure lies or how
it is connected to other brain parts.

  Irene Pepperberg, a comparative psychologist at Harvard's Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Studies whose experiments with a grey parrot
named Alex have shown that some birds are capable of extremely complex
thinking -- even grasping something akin to the sophisticated concept
of "zero" -- said she was gratified to see scientific language catching
up with reality.

  "The argument has been that birds don't have a cerebral cortex so they
can't do these things," she said. "Now we can appreciate that the bird
does have a brain area that we can imagine doing these things. It makes
all this not so incredibly surprising."

I guess we'll have to think twice before we call someone a bird brain,
unless we change the phrase to a compliment.

I can't say this article entirely surprises me. I've read about the
cognitive skills of ravens. As a teenager I had a pet crow who outsmarted
many adults and had an outrageous sense of humor.

Apparently other members of the animal kingdom have abilities that the
arrogance of our species has prevented us from seeing.

The New York Times  --  09-04-1967

U.S. Encouraged by Vietnam Vote

Officials Cite 83% Turnout Despite Vietcong Terror


by Peter Grose, Special to The New York Times (9/4/1967: p. 2)

WASHINGTON, Sept. 3-- United States officials were surprised and heartened
today at the size of turnout in South Vietnam's presidential election
despite a Vietcong terrorist campaign to disrupt the voting.

According to reports from Saigon, 83 per cent of the 5.85 million registered
voters cast their ballots yesterday.  Many of them risked reprisals
threatened by the Vietcong.

The size of the popular vote and the inability of the Vietcong to destroy
the election machinery were the two salient facts in a preliminary
assessment of the nation election based on the incomplete returns reaching
here.

Pending more detailed reports, neither the State Department nor the White
House would comment on the balloting or the victory of the military
candidates, Lieut. Gen. Nguyen Van Thieu, who was running for president, and
Premier Nguyen Cao Ky, the candidate for vice president.

A successful election has long been seen as the keystone in President
Johnson's policy of encouraging the growth of constitutional processes in
South Vietnam.  The election was the culmination of a constitutional
development that began in January, 1966, to which President Johnson gave his
personal commitment when he met Premier Ky and General Thieu, the chief of
state, in Honolulu in February.

The purpose of the voting was to give legitimacy to the Saigon Government,
which has been founded only on coups and power plays since November, 1963,
when President Ngo Dinh Deim was overthrown by a military junta.

Few members of that junta are still around, most having been ousted or
exiled in subsequent shifts of power.

Significance Not Diminished

The fact that the backing of the electorate has gone to the generals who
have been ruling South Vietnam for the last two years does not, in the
Administration's view, diminish the significance of the constitutional step
that has been taken.

The hope here is that the new government will be able to maneuver with a
confidence and legitimacy long lacking in South Vietnamese politics.  That
hope could have been dashed either by a small turnout, indicating widespread
scorn or a lack of interest in constitutional development, or by the
Vietcong's disruption of the balloting.

American officials had hoped for an 80 per cent turnout.  That was the
figure in the election in September for the Constituent Assembly.
Seventy-eight per cent of the registered voters went to the polls in
elections for local officials last spring.

Before the results of the presidential election started to come in, the
American officials warned that the turnout might be less than 80 per cent
because the polling place would be open for two or three hours less than in
the election a year ago.  The turnout  of 83 per cent was a welcome
surprise.  The turnout in the 1964 United States Presidential election was
62 per cent.

Captured documents and interrogations indicated in the last week a serious
concern among Vietcong leaders that a major effort would be required to
render the election meaningless.  This effort has not succeeded, judging
from the reports from Saigon.

The Broken Circle
by Terri Jean


When I was a little girl, my great grandma Minnie puzzled me something
awful. Though her race was far from a secret - the entire town knew her as
the "Indian Lady" - she denied her heritage until her dying day.

I remember looking at black-and-white history book and magazine photos of
Native Americans - mostly from the late 1800's - and some of those people
looked a lot like grandma. "She's Indian," my mother would explain, "but she
doesn't like being an Indian."

Doesn't like to be Indian?

I would ask why over and over again, for years upon years, and to a variety
of family members who knew grandma best. There were no answers. They didn't
know either.

I was born in 1970, at a time when Native American imagery, for the most
part, went from 'savage murderers' to 'spiritual victims.' Films from years
before, otherwise known as Cowboy & Indian movies, portrayed First Peoples
as blood-thirsty killers, circling and scalping poor, innocent settlers who
only wanted to set up a happy homestead for their families. This image was a
sharp contrast to the films of my day (and today) in which mainstream Native
characters are justice-seeking activists, spiritual tree-huggers, exotic
maidens, and/or victims of oppression and corrupt government policies and
officials.

It took more than two decades for me to understand why my grandmother denied
her heritage. It took even longer for me to fully comprehend the concept of
genocide, and to realize that grandmother was the victim of governmental
genocide. She assimilated herself into mainstream society. She left her
culture and refused to pass it on to her children, grandchildren, or to me,
her eldest great grandchild. Even though her face was Indian, her soul
wanted to be white.... and she wanted the rest of us to be white too.

I will never know why she turned her back on who she truly was. But, what I
do know is that since the dawn of this nations republic (otherwise known as
the European Invasion), Europeans have done everything in their power to
destroy the indigenous population. They consistently lied and broke
treaties, stole land and children, passed anti-Indian laws, brainwashed
children into hating their own race, and they OFTEN held people as prisoners
of war, confining them to prisons and unsanitary reservations where many
died of disease and starvation. They marched them across country, shooting
those who couldn't keep up, and when extermination policies failed, they
enacted a new weapon: assimilation. The goal of the US government was to
force Americas First Peoples to give up their culture, their traditions,
their language and their ceremonies so they could be what the US thought was
the ideal civilized American. If there were no First Peoples to account to,
then there would be no treaties or treaty rights, no history to account for,
no monies to pay out, and no reservation property to hold in trust. Manifest
Destiny would rule.

Assimilation was considered the compassionate solution to the "Indian
Problem," and even though both extermination and cultural assimilation were
policies of genocide, most of society didn't care then, just like they don't
care now.

In the latter part of the nineteenth-century, the Federal government
instituted a "degree of blood" policy in relation to land allotment. Terms
such as "full" and "one-half" were common identification labels; the more
white a person was, the more they would benefit. Those with little to no
white blood were deemed incompetent, placed under government wardship, and
under the control of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Exaggerating ones
white ancestry was common, and if a Native person could pass as white, they
often did so. Self-assimilation was, for some, easier than living in fear,
without constitutional rights or a method of ensuring personal justice. For
others, it was beneficial financially and socially. They could be like
everyone else and own a home, have civil rights, get a job, vote, and walk
among normal folk without trepidation . But for some, there was no choice.
"Turning white" and living inside the culture of the enemy was simply a
matter of survival. And as long as no one knew the truth, they were safe.

Today Native Americans continue to be defined by US government standards,
and by the amount of FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED tribal blood that pulses through
each and every body. Even if you were raised by your parents who were
Native, and they had Native parents, and you raise your children within the
First Peoples tribal culture - with the same beliefs, ceremonies, histories,
artwork, ideologies that make that culture what it is - First Peoples are
still defined by their pedigree. Defining a race by blood quantum and not
culture is a ridiculous, outdated and racist notion.

But it is a continued act of genocide? Many say yes, because as federal
guidelines tighten, the bloodlines are diluting, and a genetic cut-off point
has been established that, once you or your children reach it, you or them
are no longer a Native person by your own governments standards. All your
cultural rights are gone.

Can you imagine telling a person of another race - such an African
American - that even though they ARE African American, they are not entitled
to certain programs and benefits because they a) don't have the proper
paperwork or b) they aren't black enough?

For decades the US government has done all it could to eradicate the Native
people. They wanted to break them down, to destroy their culture, and to
prohibit future generations from enjoying their heritage. They continue
their policies of eradication even today. There are only so many Native
Americans in the US. And if each has to marry someone from another federally
recognized nation, and they cannot step outside their race, this will only
happen so many times before it is necessary to go elsewhere for a mate.
Right? But once you do, your children or grandchildren may lose their
cultural entitlements. A race will live, but it will not be recognized by
their own government. Such a race will be extinct. And this, is genocide.

But there is another side to this issue. Because the government defines
First Peoples by genetic (and not cultural) standards, there is now an open
door policy to those who were raised outside of the culture, who have not
felt the oppression, racism and prejudice associated with living within that
culture, and yet with the proper paperwork, they may be listed as more
Indian than someone living on a reservation, and thusly receiving
entitlements meant for those who need it most.

Is this fair? Some say yes, some say no. It's an issue debated often across
the United States, and especially inside Indian Country. Some First People
say let them all in, count them, bring in the new blood and grow as a
nation. Others say they receive little support as it is, support that is
their racial birthright. Why should it be shared with someone who isn't part
of the culture itself?

Both points are valid, but let me throw this into the mix: Should those
people who are successful by-products of deliberate assimilation policies be
punished just because a government, or their ancestors, have disconnected
them from their people, their heritage and their nation? Should Native
Americans turn their back on them also? What if they have a true inner
calling to rejoin their people? Should they be shunned?

These people, and there are millions of them, are victims of genocide. They
are the expected and desired consequence of policies meant to eradicate the
Native population from this land. They were removed from their culture and
forced to live outside of it. Should they be faulted for trying to get back
in?

The circle has been broken. Generations have been lost. Those who try to
learn more about what they are missing are often left to their own devices -
and that usually leads them into the world of wannabe's and false "Native"
leaders who spread their lies to those who are hungry for knowledge and a
sense of belonging.

Is there a solution? Can the circle be mended? I think so. But it would take
a lot of effort from both the Native American and the "lost bird
generation."

I met a fascinating women a few months back named Jeanne Thomas (wife of
Harry Thomas, a Winnebago elder from Nebraska) who suggested that perhaps
Native communities could offer a membership, of sorts, to those outside the
tribal nations, but who want to join or to help out. They would not be
actual tribal members, they would be more like associates or friends of the
tribes. It would be a subset of the tribal community; a membership
organization meant to support the community itself. Then the "outsiders"
could learn the real history, assist with the issues and struggles facing
that particular community, and hopefully feel a sense of familiarity with
the people they are related to, or they believe they have a special bond
with. The focus would be on education, not tribal enrollment, because
education is the key to progress and change. A membership fee could cover
the costs of a regular newsletter, meetings or perhaps an annual
celebration. Again, it would all focus on EDUCATION and building a bigger,
stronger, inclusive community.

Can you imagine the good that would come from this? The changes that could
be made in government policy, treaty rights, literature, advertising, and
Indian imagery? Think about it. When these associates know the truth, they
will understand the struggles and issues facing today's First Peoples. They
would be motivated to participate. It could be a movement. A civil and
social movement.

The "lost bird generation" would no longer be lost. The First Peoples could
keep their entitlements. And a collective voice would rise up and out of the
mouths of hundreds, thousands, maybe millions of Americans who want what's
right and what's just for the Native people... for their people... for our
people.

I am perfectly willing to help get this started. Those of you who can speak
for your people, if you would like to submit news, articles, profiles, etc.
to me at terrijean@bright.net, I will post the information to my website for
everyone to read. Just make sure it is EDUCATIONAL. And if your nation
initiates such a course of action, please let me know and I will do what I
can to promote it.

There are possibly millions of people out there who want to know more... who
want to participate. They want to belong. Give them something to belong to,
don't punish them for what the government did. Teach them the truth and get
them to join your causes. Together we can mend this broken circle.

Have a great day and cheers!

Thanks for posting this, Alan. Like no doubt many on this list, I have
several "ghosted' Indians in my family ancestry. I used to think that was a
romantic point of honor. Until I read the history of how Native American
women and children were abducted and either "married" or "raised" by white
men and families.
I think this persons approach of tribal "associates" is a good one,
undoubtedly, beset with difficulties as well. Annually, at the end of
February I go to Eureka, California to the tribal and the larger community
mourning of the 1863 massacre of Wyots on Indian Island and simultaneously,
the celebration of the Wyot New Year. My step-grandmother was part Wyot -
her grandmother and grandmother's sister were both kidnapped and enslaved by
white families in the 1850's. I was close to my step grandmother,
Assimilation? Indeed. We never spoke about being part Indian.  In the
Thirties she was a member of the Heritage Book Club - I still keep her case
bound copies of Conrad's Argosy and Alexander Pope's translations of the
Iliad and the Odyssey - the Pope, by the way, is not readable! However, I
keep them as they remain emblematic of a time.
It is forever interesting to me - the ghosted memories (Indian or not) that
run under the radar of most educations, as well as families.

JUST BUFFALO CHOOSES THE INVENTION OF SOLITUDE, BY PAUL AUSTER, FOR IF ALL
OF BUFFALO READ THE SAME BOOK 2005

Just Buffalo Literary Center has chosen The Invention of Solitude, by Paul
Auster, as the centerpiece of If All Of Buffalo Read The Same Book 2005. Mr.
Auster will be in Buffalo October 5-6 to do several book signings, a
reading/Q & A, and a film screening/Q&A. As Just Buffalo's 2005 selection
for If All of Buffalo Read the Same Book, Auster's thought-provoking memoir
will resonate region-wide. Part elegy, part intellectual self-discovery,
part family tree, the book is a study of relationships and memory,
coincidence and influence, cause and effect. It is about mystery, baseball,
murder, America, war, writing, and grieving.

At the moment of his father's fatal heart attack, author Paul Auster was on
the brink of financial and emotion ruin. He had writer's block, a failing
marriage, and a newborn son. With the modest inheritance that came with his
father's death, Auster was suddenly floating instead of drowning. "For the
first time in my life I had the time to write, to take on long projects
without worrying how I was going to pay the rent," Auster has said. "It's a
terrible equation, finally. To think that my father's death saved my life."
What Auster wrote with this new time and money, The Invention of Solitude,
saved his father's life in return.

In the book's first section, a reflection on his father's life and death,
Auster recorded what he could of a man who had otherwise "left no traces."
If he did not write what he knew of his father, Auster realized, "his entire
life [would] vanish along with him." Instead, Auster transformed his father'
s remoteness-and his son's struggle to understand it-into a book that
touches readers' experiences of mourning and memory. "I've received scores
of letters, hundreds of letters, from people who've told me how much the
book helped them to get through the rough experience of losing a parent,"
Auster said. "In writing my own story, I seemed to touch on something that
other people could respond to. For a writer, working alone in his little
room, there's no greater reward than that."

Presented this year in conjunction with WBFO 88.7 FM and Talking Leaves
Books, If All of Buffalo Read the Same Book continues Just Buffalo's 30-year
mission to create and strengthen communities through the literary arts. Now
in its fifth year, the program provides a common point of reference-a single
book-from which to foster conversations among the diverse communities of
Buffalo and Western New York. The book is available for purchase at all area
bookstores, as well as online. All book sales made through Talking Leaves
Books will benefit Just Buffalo. A free readers guide is available for
download at www.justbuffalo.org.

Alan,
Thank you! =20

This is poignant writing; I'm particularly fond of the lack of cynicism. =
 Terri sees a better place for the peoples of this and other nations to =
be intellectually than to stand on bitterness and dismiss a future =
because of a deprived or worst usurped past.  How compassionate and how =
warmly human that is of her. =20

I am delighted to have read the work and learned of Terri's efforts and =
of her group.  I am indebted to you for your having found and shared =
this information.

  The Broken Circle
  by Terri Jean


  When I was a little girl, my great grandma Minnie puzzled me something
  awful. Though her race was far from a secret - the entire town knew =
her as
  the "Indian Lady" - she denied her heritage until her dying day.

  I remember looking at black-and-white history book and magazine photos =
of
  Native Americans - mostly from the late 1800's - and some of those =
people
  looked a lot like grandma. "She's Indian," my mother would explain, =
"but she
  doesn't like being an Indian."

  Doesn't like to be Indian?

  I would ask why over and over again, for years upon years, and to a =
variety
  of family members who knew grandma best. There were no answers. They =
didn't
  know either.

  I was born in 1970, at a time when Native American imagery, for the =
most
  part, went from 'savage murderers' to 'spiritual victims.' Films from =
years
  before, otherwise known as Cowboy & Indian movies, portrayed First =
Peoples
  as blood-thirsty killers, circling and scalping poor, innocent =
settlers who
  only wanted to set up a happy homestead for their families. This image =
was a
  sharp contrast to the films of my day (and today) in which mainstream =
Native
  characters are justice-seeking activists, spiritual tree-huggers, =
exotic
  maidens, and/or victims of oppression and corrupt government policies =
and
  officials.

  It took more than two decades for me to understand why my grandmother =
denied
  her heritage. It took even longer for me to fully comprehend the =
concept of
  genocide, and to realize that grandmother was the victim of =
governmental
  genocide. She assimilated herself into mainstream society. She left =
her
  culture and refused to pass it on to her children, grandchildren, or =
to me,
  her eldest great grandchild. Even though her face was Indian, her soul
  wanted to be white.... and she wanted the rest of us to be white too.

  I will never know why she turned her back on who she truly was. But, =
what I
  do know is that since the dawn of this nations republic (otherwise =
known as
  the European Invasion), Europeans have done everything in their power =
to
  destroy the indigenous population. They consistently lied and broke
  treaties, stole land and children, passed anti-Indian laws, =
brainwashed
  children into hating their own race, and they OFTEN held people as =
prisoners
  of war, confining them to prisons and unsanitary reservations where =
many
  died of disease and starvation. They marched them across country, =
shooting
  those who couldn't keep up, and when extermination policies failed, =
they
  enacted a new weapon: assimilation. The goal of the US government was =
to
  force Americas First Peoples to give up their culture, their =
traditions,
  their language and their ceremonies so they could be what the US =
thought was
  the ideal civilized American. If there were no First Peoples to =
account to,
  then there would be no treaties or treaty rights, no history to =
account for,
  no monies to pay out, and no reservation property to hold in trust. =
Manifest
  Destiny would rule.

  Assimilation was considered the compassionate solution to the "Indian
  Problem," and even though both extermination and cultural assimilation =
were
  policies of genocide, most of society didn't care then, just like they =
don't
  care now.

  In the latter part of the nineteenth-century, the Federal government
  instituted a "degree of blood" policy in relation to land allotment. =
Terms
  such as "full" and "one-half" were common identification labels; the =
more
  white a person was, the more they would benefit. Those with little to =
no
  white blood were deemed incompetent, placed under government wardship, =
and
  under the control of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Exaggerating =
ones
  white ancestry was common, and if a Native person could pass as white, =
they
  often did so. Self-assimilation was, for some, easier than living in =
fear,
  without constitutional rights or a method of ensuring personal =
justice. For
  others, it was beneficial financially and socially. They could be like
  everyone else and own a home, have civil rights, get a job, vote, and =
walk
  among normal folk without trepidation . But for some, there was no =
choice.
  "Turning white" and living inside the culture of the enemy was simply =
a
  matter of survival. And as long as no one knew the truth, they were =
safe.

  Today Native Americans continue to be defined by US government =
standards,
  and by the amount of FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED tribal blood that pulses =
through
  each and every body. Even if you were raised by your parents who were
  Native, and they had Native parents, and you raise your children =
within the
  First Peoples tribal culture - with the same beliefs, ceremonies, =
histories,
  artwork, ideologies that make that culture what it is - First Peoples =
are
  still defined by their pedigree. Defining a race by blood quantum and =
not
  culture is a ridiculous, outdated and racist notion.

  But it is a continued act of genocide? Many say yes, because as =
federal
  guidelines tighten, the bloodlines are diluting, and a genetic cut-off =
point
  has been established that, once you or your children reach it, you or =
them
  are no longer a Native person by your own governments standards. All =
your
  cultural rights are gone.

  Can you imagine telling a person of another race - such an African
  American - that even though they ARE African American, they are not =
entitled
  to certain programs and benefits because they a) don't have the proper
  paperwork or b) they aren't black enough?

  For decades the US government has done all it could to eradicate the =
Native
  people. They wanted to break them down, to destroy their culture, and =
to
  prohibit future generations from enjoying their heritage. They =
continue
  their policies of eradication even today. There are only so many =
Native
  Americans in the US. And if each has to marry someone from another =
federally
  recognized nation, and they cannot step outside their race, this will =
only
  happen so many times before it is necessary to go elsewhere for a =
mate.
  Right? But once you do, your children or grandchildren may lose their
  cultural entitlements. A race will live, but it will not be recognized =
by
  their own government. Such a race will be extinct. And this, is =
genocide.

  But there is another side to this issue. Because the government =
defines
  First Peoples by genetic (and not cultural) standards, there is now an =
open
  door policy to those who were raised outside of the culture, who have =
not
  felt the oppression, racism and prejudice associated with living =
within that
  culture, and yet with the proper paperwork, they may be listed as more
  Indian than someone living on a reservation, and thusly receiving
  entitlements meant for those who need it most.

  Is this fair? Some say yes, some say no. It's an issue debated often =
across
  the United States, and especially inside Indian Country. Some First =
People
  say let them all in, count them, bring in the new blood and grow as a
  nation. Others say they receive little support as it is, support that =
is
  their racial birthright. Why should it be shared with someone who =
isn't part
  of the culture itself?

  Both points are valid, but let me throw this into the mix: Should =
those
  people who are successful by-products of deliberate assimilation =
policies be
  punished just because a government, or their ancestors, have =
disconnected
  them from their people, their heritage and their nation? Should Native
  Americans turn their back on them also? What if they have a true inner
  calling to rejoin their people? Should they be shunned?

  These people, and there are millions of them, are victims of genocide. =
They
  are the expected and desired consequence of policies meant to =
eradicate the
  Native population from this land. They were removed from their culture =
and
  forced to live outside of it. Should they be faulted for trying to get =
back
  in?

  The circle has been broken. Generations have been lost. Those who try =
to
  learn more about what they are missing are often left to their own =
devices -
  and that usually leads them into the world of wannabe's and false =
"Native"
  leaders who spread their lies to those who are hungry for knowledge =
and a
  sense of belonging.

  Is there a solution? Can the circle be mended? I think so. But it =
would take
  a lot of effort from both the Native American and the "lost bird
  generation."

  I met a fascinating women a few months back named Jeanne Thomas (wife =
of
  Harry Thomas, a Winnebago elder from Nebraska) who suggested that =
perhaps
  Native communities could offer a membership, of sorts, to those =
outside the
  tribal nations, but who want to join or to help out. They would not be
  actual tribal members, they would be more like associates or friends =
of the
  tribes. It would be a subset of the tribal community; a membership
  organization meant to support the community itself. Then the =
"outsiders"
  could learn the real history, assist with the issues and struggles =
facing
  that particular community, and hopefully feel a sense of familiarity =
with
  the people they are related to, or they believe they have a special =
bond
  with. The focus would be on education, not tribal enrollment, because
  education is the key to progress and change. A membership fee could =
cover
  the costs of a regular newsletter, meetings or perhaps an annual
  celebration. Again, it would all focus on EDUCATION and building a =
bigger,
  stronger, inclusive community.

  Can you imagine the good that would come from this? The changes that =
could
  be made in government policy, treaty rights, literature, advertising, =
and
  Indian imagery? Think about it. When these associates know the truth, =
they
  will understand the struggles and issues facing today's First Peoples. =
They
  would be motivated to participate. It could be a movement. A civil and
  social movement.

  The "lost bird generation" would no longer be lost. The First Peoples =
could
  keep their entitlements. And a collective voice would rise up and out =
of the
  mouths of hundreds, thousands, maybe millions of Americans who want =
what's
  right and what's just for the Native people... for their people... for =
our
  people.

  I am perfectly willing to help get this started. Those of you who can =
speak
  for your people, if you would like to submit news, articles, profiles, =
etc.
  to me at terrijean@bright.net<mailto:terrijean@bright.net>, I will =
post the information to my website for
  everyone to read. Just make sure it is EDUCATIONAL. And if your nation
  initiates such a course of action, please let me know and I will do =
what I
  can to promote it.

  There are possibly millions of people out there who want to know =
more... who
  want to participate. They want to belong. Give them something to =
belong to,
  don't punish them for what the government did. Teach them the truth =
and get
  them to join your causes. Together we can mend this broken circle.

  Have a great day and cheers!

&gt; JUST BUFFALO CHOOSES THE INVENTION OF SOLITUDE, BY PAUL AUSTER, FOR IF
ALL<BR>
&gt; OF BUFFALO READ THE SAME BOOK 2005<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Just Buffalo Literary Center has chosen The Invention of Solitude, by
Paul<BR>
&gt; Auster, as the centerpiece of If All Of Buffalo Read The Same Book
2005. Mr.<BR>
&gt; Auster will be in Buffalo October 5-6 to do several book signings,
a<BR>
&gt; reading/Q &amp; A, and a film screening/Q&amp;A. As Just Buffalo's 2005
selection<BR>
&gt; for If All of Buffalo Read the Same Book, Auster's thought-provoking
memoir<BR>
&gt; will resonate region-wide. Part elegy, part intellectual
self-discovery,<BR>
&gt; part family tree, the book is a study of relationships and memory,<BR>
&gt; coincidence and influence, cause and effect. It is about mystery,
baseball,<BR>
&gt; murder, America, war, writing, and grieving.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; At the moment of his father's fatal heart attack, author Paul Auster
was on<BR>
&gt; the brink of financial and emotion ruin. He had writer's block, a
failing<BR>
&gt; marriage, and a newborn son. With the modest inheritance that came with
his<BR>
&gt; father's death, Auster was suddenly floating instead of drowning.
&quot;For the<BR>
&gt; first time in my life I had the time to write, to take on long
projects<BR>
&gt; without worrying how I was going to pay the rent,&quot; Auster has
said. &quot;It's a<BR>
&gt; terrible equation, finally. To think that my father's death saved my
life.&quot;<BR>
&gt; What Auster wrote with this new time and money, The Invention of
Solitude,<BR>
&gt; saved his father's life in return.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; In the book's first section, a reflection on his father's life and
death,<BR>
&gt; Auster recorded what he could of a man who had otherwise &quot;left no
traces.&quot;<BR>
&gt; If he did not write what he knew of his father, Auster realized,
&quot;his entire<BR>
&gt; life [would] vanish along with him.&quot; Instead, Auster transformed
his father'<BR>
&gt; s remoteness-and his son's struggle to understand it-into a book
that<BR>
&gt; touches readers' experiences of mourning and memory. &quot;I've
received scores<BR>
&gt; of letters, hundreds of letters, from people who've told me how much
the<BR>
&gt; book helped them to get through the rough experience of losing a
parent,&quot;<BR>
&gt; Auster said. &quot;In writing my own story, I seemed to touch on
something that<BR>
&gt; other people could respond to. For a writer, working alone in his
little<BR>
&gt; room, there's no greater reward than that.&quot;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Presented this year in conjunction with WBFO 88.7 FM and Talking
Leaves<BR>
&gt; Books, If All of Buffalo Read the Same Book continues Just Buffalo's
30-year<BR>
&gt; mission to create and strengthen communities through the literary arts.
Now<BR>
&gt; in its fifth year, the program provides a common point of reference-a
single<BR>
&gt; book-from which to foster conversations among the diverse communities
of<BR>
&gt; Buffalo and Western New York. The book is available for purchase at all
area<BR>
&gt; bookstores, as well as online. All book sales made through Talking
Leaves<BR>
&gt; Books will benefit Just Buffalo. A free readers guide is available
for<BR>
&gt; download at www.justbuffalo.org.<BR>

no, we've only banned political poems.  but this appears to be political, as the poet's disdain for the people--and apparently sex in public places--while put in rather blunt yet transgressively non-academic terms ("yuck"), clearly portends a systematic, rigorous and comprehensive philosophy of social change as it relates to poison stickers.  while I agree with the poet's comprehensive grasp of nuances of poison control, i don't it necessarily entails taking a position against sex in public places.

I missed the reference to sex in public places. Unless you mean poems
about sex
or in favor of sex, published and therefore public.

Hi, Camille:

I hope you heard from Shippensburg or the university in Orlando.  If not, well you're like me.  I finally called the Chair's assistant at UIC who told me that they were just finished with the interview process and she could not give me any more information but will start send letter soon.  I suppose that I am not selected.  Is this code language or what?  There is unfortunately not much else left to apply to, as I don't want to apply to a community college.  I guess that I am thinking more the way you were thinking and will start consider other options, other fields, and other countries. . .  That's a bit demoralizing.

You know, if you would like, I would be glad to read your manuscript and give you feedback.  I know that you don't have a reader for your creative work, so I'm volunteering!

My very best,

Brigitte

At this buffet known as Poetics, it's nice to receive some attention. I
thank you kindly. I think I've stumbled into dialectical poetry, a way of
exchanging points of view and building understanding of individual perspectives  by
combining poems, key words, scrambles, etc. It reminds me of an  older
technique the name of which escapes me at this moment when  poets responded to one
another with satire, poem vs. poem. I now trust  my intuitive reponses more and
accidentally use the right words. I meant  to say "nosh" instead of "gnash",
but the meaning of the poem  deepens when speaking of digestion and
disagreement. Poets shouldn't gnash  their teeth towards one another regarding taste and
form . . .  just  politics and philosophy. Mary Jo

"a love that is everyone's business.
 a drink from the common trough."

this reading may be tendentious.

Monsieur Kominos Zervos thus spake:

"like poetry, i like theory and i like argument, just like you.  But what
i've found on the list is that there are a lot of cowboys and cowgirls that
are out to make a name for themselves, by attacking poets/townies (as you
call them) who have an established reputation. "


Sounds like bitter twisties - never encountered much attacking established
poets - criticsing - questioning etc - yes.

Theory  and reading etc - good. Knowledge good - life experience -also
good -all good. Both book and life learning all good -all kinds of learning
and experience good (on the muck ball - given 'sub speciae...').

Attacking? Dont see that much.

Cowboys/cowgirls? Never seen any.

Cant accept the rocky rocky of the hurly burly burly?

Its the the attackee's problem - maybe to the "established" it is a
problem - scared of others climbing up to the top of the attackee's tower
perhaps.

I would be one of those.
Spent 15 years as a professional performance poet and school writing
workshop facilitator.
Published 6 books of poetry before i read a word of theory, or considered
poetics in a formal sense.
Found the computer and literary theory and new media theory and a whole
bunch of other theories in 1993,1994,1995 onwards.
I'm still here.
I like poetry, i like theory and i like argument, just like you. But what
i've found on the list is that there are a lot of cowboys and cowgirls that
are out to make a name for themselves, by attacking poets/townies (as you
call them) who have an established reputation.
Why submit posts when someone wants a shoot-out, pardner.

Thank You I enjoy reading your work  and of others on this list.  Developing
a style of communication should be something that is welcomed and not
blacklisted.
Politics is part of what formulates how we express ourselves. We better be
on top of it
or Patriot Act Part II-could ban our ability to talk about politics in any
kind of communication.
As far as style is concerned, Sandburg was not welcomed by the critics
because of his politics and his verse was to easy to understand. If you
condemn people because they write to clearly there is a problem.
Politics was the  reason Ezra Pounds work was hard to get in America after
WWII.
Poetry and Politics to hard to separate.

Sorry Richard,
That is how you spell your name isn't it?
Sorry but Jon was asking why there were few poet-academics on the list, =
i
was just offering a possible explanation.
I also pointed out that i fitted his description of a poet-academic and =
i
was still on the list. However i am not important enough a poet to =
attack,
so i don't get attacked much, so no " bitter twisties" really just
observations.
Why am i not important enough? Well i'm australian and i have come from
being a performance poet and now work in the area of new media poetry or
cyberpoetry or digital poetry or e-poetry, call it what you will (like).
Three good reasons for some people on this list, basically dedicated to
print poetry and poetics, to not consider me important enough to attack.

If i was important enough people would take the trouble to ensure that =
they
spelt my name correctly, and, well, i have to correct that quite often,

Cheers
Komninos
That's komninos, spelt komninos.

This makes my final post for this day but if any of you on the list
would like
I am more than willing to make a semi-personal scathing backchannel
invective just for you. Really I am quite good at it. I have often been
urged to go to insult school which is located in Florida.

While you have already seen how I can take a stereotype, say a beatnik
jazz poet (IV drug user, unable to write a cogent sentence, lazy,
disinterested in the notion of poetic craft) and have some fun with it
in the unauthorized back channel that was published, (after just
reviewing it, I still get a good tee-hee about the part where I advocate
shooting up to increase comprehension); however, why stop there, I can
do so much more.

Although I am not an academic, instead "a townie" to answer that
question, and since the term "academic" does not infer more or less high
falutin poetic or gramatical clarity, I am offering to create a
brilliantly articulate vida or razo full of nastiness just for you.  All
I need is your name to create this ancient poetic form of introduction
which is often thought to have evolved into the modern day roast. After
a completed version arrives in your mailbox you can hit the forward
button to post the unpleasantries on poetics. Use the stereotype people
have of people like you as a defense for this action. For example, if
you are of the type previously discussed, one sans dictionary (this
means without), then not knowing the words "forward" or "send" or not
being conscious of your actions, might all be sufficient reasons for
such a forwarded malfunction. Send me a note if you would like a little
razo!


Be well

A key translation in the English language. It seems until the 19th century
people did not know how closely Chaucer's poem was based on Boccaccio's.

Dear Mairead--

On the record-- I mean unless you really want to add to my current
condition, I could send a separate, very different, post homeward --I've
been curious if the oatmeal poem is something that is expected from a
Irish lass or laddie. Thinking of it, is lass or laddie racist? What
about those hats that are pointed in the front? Are there other things
expected if you are Irish, like talking about Joyce?

For myself being a French / Indian I am supposed to poke fun at other
Americans who pronounce my name wrong, (not mis-spell, komninos) eat fry
bread and extol the virtues of corn but call it maize. There's not a
specific poetic requirement expected, on the Indian side probably
because we were not allowed to practice art for such a long time(not
until the 1940's, or ones blood was white enough, say less than 25%) let
alone consider writing poetry. On the French side I believe I am
required to translate some other poets and uphold Mallarme, especially
considering my writing is somewhat experimental.

Except for the French horse in Ulysses and the French mechanicians in
Dubliners I really scarcely remember a damn thing about Joyce. The
French servitude is really unbecoming, and probably a big reason for it
all being called fiction. I mean isn't that why a British guy removed
Joyce's only copy and published it? Or am I being tracist again?

As for Hall, I am not aware of the poem, I've avoided him, lack of
updated images, not nearly the ear of his contemporaries.  Olive St JG.
rhymes way too much for me, always has Popeye saving him, and let Joyce
stay in his house, what else to say.

since it has been a long time, cleaning out some mail, here is the
original--
-----------
Joyce started off as a poet actually David, it's rather amazing in the
light of the consequent work in fiction though some would say the poetry

of the later fiction hands down beats the poetry of the earlier poetry
or that the later fiction dissolves into poetry though that implies
fiction has boundaries poetry doesn't.  What I'm surprised at is that
Joyce was at Dodge in the first place.  I didn't know he had visited
America.  That must have been after the trial.  Do you know Gogarty's
poem "After Reading Hall's 'Toy'" (sometimes called "Ringsend"): "I will

live in Ringsend with a red-headed whore, / And the fan-light gone in /
Where it lights Donald Hall's door," etc?  I suppose Hall could have
taken offense but doesn't seem to have, they were such jolly chaps the
old masters.  But I've often tried to find that poem of Hall's called
"Toy" -- do you know it?
Mairead
(By the way have you noticed a lot of people on this list talking about
what they have for their breakfast?  I remember the grand old days of
POETICS when people poured scorn and eviscerated one another.  These are

strange lost times.)

stay in his house, what else to say.

since it has been a long time, cleaning out some mail, here is the
original--
-----------
Joyce started off as a poet actually David, it's rather amazing in the
light of the consequent work in fiction though some would say the poetry

of the later fiction hands down beats the poetry of the earlier poetry
or that the later fiction dissolves into poetry though that implies
fiction has boundaries poetry doesn't.  What I'm surprised at is that
Joyce was at Dodge in the first place.  I didn't know he had visited
America.  That must have been after the trial.  Do you know Gogarty's
poem "After Reading Hall's 'Toy'" (sometimes called "Ringsend"): "I will

live in Ringsend with a red-headed whore, / And the fan-light gone in /
Where it lights Donald Hall's door," etc?  I suppose Hall could have
taken offense but doesn't seem to have, they were such jolly chaps the
old masters.  But I've often tried to find that poem of Hall's called
"Toy" -- do you know it?

(By the way have you noticed a lot of people on this list talking about
what they have for their breakfast?  I remember the grand old days of
POETICS when people poured scorn and eviscerated one another.  These are

strange lost times.)

Usually I would suggest rooming with our associate editor, but we will
not be able to see you at AWP. This is the first year this millennium
that we will not be attending with our wares and it saddens me as you
were one of the folks we were hoping to see. We would have had you sign
some books at the table and stolen some University of Iowa books just
like last year. Actually that is wrong, we would have gotten you
something more appropriate, say Talonbooks or Coach House instead. While
you might hear some other reason through the po-vine for our absence,
maybe that we were importing illegal grains across the border (oatmeal,
oddly enough), that our interns are felons, that we are being held
responsible for Ohio voting to re-elect our current president and so on;
however, I believe the real reason is because I sent a misunderstood
missive about an important Canadian poet and he has used persuasive
imagistic language to bar our entry. Our denied passports bear testimony
to his mastery. If only our poets here had such power.

This summer we will tour the eastern states and hope to stop in NYC,
Boston, Albany, Maine, Buffalo, Rochester, DC, Syracuse, Pittsburgh,
Kent, Cleveland, Philly, Newark, Harrisburgh, and other places offered
to us; needless to say, Toronto has been scratched.  Other firmer offers
are appreciated from all. NYC is our only confirmed date for Si, Dorian
and David the beginning of July. I hope you will read with us then. Say
howdy to everyone. Kiss them for me.

This whole issue of whether people are poet-academics - or poets who learnt
from the street and so on has been debated before - and also the Vispos etc
clashed with some of the Langpos etc etc  - I'm not "dedicated" to print
poetry - am interested in other media poetry but for now I do poetry that is
seen on the page - but I was  a performance poet - well I was one  (in New
Zealand) because at first when I started writing again in about 1989 (I was
41) I got a big buzz from the immediate reception of my poems - but I now
rarely read in public  - the reasons are related to the fact I have a binge
alcoholic problem (and I almost always get pissed at poetry readings - so
such events are a danger zone for me ) - and indeed I feel that being
published in the magazines etc or doing or getting a book published are
better for me now - although that  hasn't happened to the extent I have
become "recognized" per se...

I actually thought you were referring to some of the attacks on the Langpos
etc  and I have criticised the politics off some myself (not their poetics
so much)  - but I am indebted to them for a lot of innovative ideas and the
politics of them is difficult to pinpoint in any case ( and each of course
hold their own views as we all do) -and it may not matter  so much...but
some of my posts may have looked like "attacks" and I thought you were
generalizing about writers such as Steve who were"attacking' some of the
established poets -

But it seems I got that wrong - it isn't necessarily good to be attacked
Kominos  (I forgot your name before) but if by that you mean recognition -
you would be just as recognised whatever medium surely ..but I don't know
much about that debate ( I know once there was debate on the merits of Vispo
v other methods once)

We all like to be recognised but I just enjoy reading poetry/criticism and
so on - I seem to have lost the 'drive' to type up my poems etc (or make
books or whatever - they stay - often  literally hand written) - I want to
get some old ones from my Amiga and I believe it might be easy to transfer
them with a scanner..(once I have printed them all  I want to store the
Amiga - never throw anything away!)

But even when I have written something I often leave it in a notebook -
unfinished as I miss the buzz of direct "publication" to an audience -
unless someone wants to publish them - and I have been asked to on a few
occasions- so that's good - but as I say I don't do much unless someone
wants me to contribute - so I don't send much unsolicited.

I did at one stage but these days busy with my book hobby /business etc.

But I found your post confusing - perhaps clearer now - - but re
recognition -  being Australian shouldn't matter - there are some very great
Australian writers/poets -

but I cant see the point of what David Baratier is saying - he may as well
be talking in Chinese - he said something about someone being a drug user...

If he's being high jinks silly buggers that's ok - I've been there and done
that - but otherwise I cant figure him out - - no idea who he's talking
about or what - you are ok...we talked about Guy Davenport and the things
you sent he wrote about Wittgenstein.

I'm neither for nor against academia ( if I could I would be an academic -
it just hast happened that way that I am not) - try to stay open to poems to
all styles of writing and media  (my "attack" on jazz and the kabala was
really just silly buggers...satire..it misfired a bit...) -

In general the better read someone is the better poet/artist they will be
but there are (many?) exceptions

One encounters those who are aggressively proud of never having got past
form 3 or whatever or even never went to school and the other extreme of
people who are arrogant because of their great learning/ or their great
"success" etc  - but most people are a healthy in-between of that and an
interesting mix - a variegation - we are learning machines we humans - we
learn from everything. I don't put "successful" people - or any person on
this earth above myself - whatever he she has done or who they are.

From lecture halls to the famed university of life....or other, as the case
may be

Sorry Richard,
That is how you spell your name isn't it?
Sorry but Jon was asking why there were few poet-academics on the list, i
was just offering a possible explanation.
I also pointed out that i fitted his description of a poet-academic and i
was still on the list. However i am not important enough a poet to attack,
so i don't get attacked much, so no " bitter twisties" really just
observations.
Why am i not important enough? Well i'm australian and i have come from
being a performance poet and now work in the area of new media poetry or
cyberpoetry or digital poetry or e-poetry, call it what you will (like).
Three good reasons for some people on this list, basically dedicated to
print poetry and poetics, to not consider me important enough to attack.

If i was important enough people would take the trouble to ensure that they
spelt my name correctly, and, well, i have to correct that quite often,

Cheers

Hi Richard,

Just for the record, I was not asking as a matter of "debate," or to
suggest a preference for one group or the other. I suspected that the
recent posts gave a very inaccurate representation of the List's current
membership, and I was hoping I'd get a better idea of who was here by
asking a direct question. How one defines a townie might be a debatable
question, but my first question was intended simply, not as an excuse to
offer an opinion, or to disparage anyone's lifestyle. I've no interest
in clashing with anyone over a school or poetic, as I usually find other
reasons. :)

Regards,

Well I dont know what you mean by "townie" but I am - or have been since1970
(when I did some writing) in the work force - mainly as a labourer but then
as a Lineman/ Cable Jointer - then a technician - then I got back into
things about 1990 when I was 42 and did a degree in English at the Auckland
University - I was reading my poems live then and was influenced by old and
new poetry and in particular a poetry paper on contemporary US poetry which
included the Language poets and I was looking at the text we had then today
(in In the American Tree)  - actually an essay by Jackson MacLow on
referentiality ( the more or less inacurate use of that term) and the
question of their being a "no Mind" as  he calls it  - I was thus thinking
of Richard von Sturmer who is a  NZ Poet but also travels each year to the
US to a Zen Buddhist place - he an interesting poet and influenced I think
by Language poetry but also by the Oulippo group.

Re myself I have chapbook and one book called RED and published in a few
local mags ( -- once I was published in Chicago -not the famous mag  - a
small mag...about 1998)  and have been recently in BRIEF a more or less
"innovative" mag in Auckland here...hard copy...but am not
"established"...still an "outsider"  - lol...

[When I say "debate"  I dont mean or imply any acrimony ]

But this List probably has a varying membership and right now a lot are
probably on holiday - but that said there of course a lot of people in
academia here - Ron Silliman is more on his Blog but he has and does peep
into the room here from time to time - and he and others are not academics,
but they are pretty well educated/smart cookies - as you probably know -
Nick is 'academic' but I believe he works in [a professional capacity] - how
many are students?

Presumably people on here have more interest in theory etc and
modern/postmodern and or innovative poetics than elsewhere...and while
poetic practice and styles vary that is maybe one common factor -

but there is quite a lot of  back channelling etc goes on some of which is
very good....a lot here or here associated have been very kind to me or at
least interesting....some hover in the bacground and read the EPC things ...

Others pour their poetry on - come hell or high water...the "debates" here
are a bit on the luke side  (either "clubby" ) or they fizzle out ( but some
are good) -discussions were very motile and energetic when I was on here
from 2000 to about 2003)

Subject: POETRY SUPER HIGHWAY announces 4th annual GREAT POETRY EXCHANGE

The 4th Annual Poetry Super Highway
Great Poetry Exchange
The mission of the Poetry Super Highway
is to expose as many people to as many
other people's poetry as possible.

What?
In February 2005, the Poetry Super Highway will coordinate a great free
exchange of poetry publications amongst poets worldwide.

It's not a contest. There are no judges, entry fees, winners, or losers.

Last year, 78 poets participated both sending their book and receiving
another poet's book from a randomly selected other participant

By agreeing to participate, someone will be exposed to your poetry, and
you will be exposed to someone else's poetry.


How?
To participate you must volunteer to mail one copy of one poetry book
that you have written to one other person participating.=A0 Just one book.
In exchange, you will receive in the mail one copy of one poetry book
written by another participating poet.

E-books are not eligible for the Great Poetry Exchange. Your book must
be physical entity.=A0 Even if it's self published, or one of one that you
printed from your computer and stapled together...but please no e-books.

(We are working on a special e-book only event for later in the year so
stay tuned for that!)

E-mail=A0 <mailto:GPE@PoetrySuperHighway.com> GPE@PoetrySuperHighway.com

Include in your e-mail:

The title of your book

A description of your book no longer than 50 words.

Your name

Your mailing address

Your website address (if you have one.)

In the middle of March, we will randomly assign the books to each
participant and email to you the name and address of the person you are
supposed to send your book to.
We will also list your book and description on
<http://PoetrySuperHighway.com/pshgpe.html> this web page along with the
link to your website for all to see. In addition we will list the new
books in our weekly e-mailed update which goes out to thousands of
people.
Please note, as the Great Poetry Exchange is open to everyone on planet
Earth, it's possible that you will be required to send your book to
someone outside of your own country which will, of course cost you more
in postage than it would to send it domestically.
Also, we'll ask that you send us an e-mail in March once your book has
actually been sent so we can keep track and make sure that all
participants who send a book also get one.

You also must agree to send out your book within 2 weeks of being
notified of who to send your book to.

David B.,


Your presence (and table) will be missed at AWP!  Of
course, I won't be there either.  I'll be at the PCA
Conference in San Diego.  Within the U.S., I think the
farthest west I've ever been is Chicago.  Will you be
out that way?  Any recommendations for sights to see
in CA?


As for your denied passports, one rumor claims that
last year’s stolen books at AWP figure into Canada’s
decision somehow … that, plus your notoriety as an
oatmeal smuggler.


I'd love to see you and yours whenever you come!  Send
the itinerary a.s.a.p., and I will arrange the banquet
hall feast … mutton and the finest grains all around!
You’ll need to be replenished during the whirlwind
tour ~

Just gave this wonderful book a thumbs up on Amazon, and noticed that it
was listed as not available. I hope this is a mistake, as it is a
beautifully produced book filled with great little poems that are not at
all little.  Jesse

Just for the record - I wish I were an academic poet; I feel I belong in
the university, and my students usually do better than I do. But I remain
at the margins, which means no conference or travel money, no computer
tech or facilities available, no free equipment to play with - in short,
no communality garnered by the institution. Trust me, it's harder out
here. There's nothing wrong with support.

Be careful of what you wish for, Alan. I've lived longer at the margins
of the academic world than I have at the margins of the literary/poetical
world--years of annual contracts stamped "NO BENEFITS"; no
pension; etc. etc. On the other hand, no committees, no meetings,
no officemates, no deans.

Not complaining, mind you. I like it here at the margins, where I can
splash around and actually see the bottom. The water's not so deep,
and the current ain't so strong.

NORTHEAST

if you picked any story but this,
I wouldn't know where to begin.

The grey November sky predicting early snow,
The ground already resisting footprints.

A young doe in my garden looks up;
How the mind seeing, loses sight.

Inside where I stand, one cobweb on the ceiling
Delicately twists when the furnace comes to life.

What if I turned my face away
And when I looked back you were gone?

The freezing mud in the driveway
Seizes the tires in their ruts overnight.

I wish for multiple eyes like a spider,
My forehead of shining cobblestones.

Subject:      Chinese-English translator needed
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

If anyone knows of a translator who can translate Chinese poet's Huang Xiang's work, I would appreciate it if you could email me at paulcatafago@movementone.org. Huang Xiang is a poet who was imprisoned twelve years in China because of his role in the Democracy Wall Movement and other crimes against the government. He has had fifteen Chinese language books published in Taiwan, Hong Kong and the U.S. His books are still banned in his native China. In 2004, Mellen Press published "A Bi-Lingual Edition of Poetry Out Of Communist China By Huang Xiang." It is a comprehensive collection of translations of Xiang's poetry, spanning 40 years. Unfortunately, Huang Xiang's translator, Andrew Emerson died suddenly in August, 2004, several months after the book's publication.
Since that time, Huang Xiang has been without a translator. Currently, Xiang and his wife, the writer Zhang Ling, live in Pittsburgh, hosted by the North American Network of the Cities of Asylum Program, an organization whose board includes Wole Soyinka and Carolyn Forche.
Again, if anyone is interested, or if you want more information (like Huang Xiang's bio, sample poetry, etc.) please email me at the above address.

number one nation (#1!)
by Betsy Fagin

Gift I meaning. Filled with our lives.
Our worthwhile. Are we focus, practice.
Fear reducing. Crime reducing. We survival
Each other in interest. We theory exchange.
Today I would like to buy everyone=92s breakfast.
Condemning this and that. Suspicious, quite.
Are people traffic tickets? Their phone bills' calling?
Rein in the umbrellas. Out-hand them!
I when illness mental. I when office workered,
Chip-implanted. Better luck had women
This is how wary they were,
Conscious of children=92s security.
Toys to homeless for lack of food,
A neighborhood of clinging papers. Sell it
To strangers, the kindness of a number one nation.

-- I WISH SENSE IN LOSS, and wish that
sense in mountains, frost, poised moonlight
above ornamented shivering of thunder
between those mountains... dim me, though
I see the vermin at my toes are hard at work
syllabling bright the scales of sirens singing
at Pluto's ships.. lyres, rough, pressed they cruel
though sometimes coy & polished near to grated
then again all animals are fanciful before my glass,
when wearing my air... oh how billows...
oh, the thunder's ornament? -- we drained
its sparkles for our charms (censure
that back to childish hours; Oh! how
billows your gleams, memory! standing
atop that hill not long ago, I had the chance
to exclaim, of the sun shining on my barrel,
"on my musket's throat day does languish"
before finding myself here to -- not com-
plete it, but to say "I wish sense in loss" &
look over my shoulder for the ball, the report,
the thunder's ornament... the thunder's ornament?
we drained its sparkles for our charms

But as you pointed out during your stint in Miami
As a non-academic you can;

Not have to deal with bureaucracy
Have a sustained artistic thought that will not be interrupted for days
Not have to constantly justify your existence

"Not have to deal with bureaucracy"
      one has to be the working poor
"Have a sustained artistic thought that
will not be interrupted for days"
      one has to alienate family and  friends
"Not have to constantly justify your existence"
      one must write to live
You have to emerge from a creative cocoon
     and see if it flies
Publishing is the only bureaucracy that matters
     to give it away is philanthropic poetry
Sometimes poetry is a warm bowl of soup
     for many others, a magazine in the waiting  room

Take a look at this manuscript. It's actually pretty
interesting, despite its authors' (plural) intentions.
Here's the constraint under which it was produced:

"Under "direction" of James D. Macdonald, each author
was given minimal information from which to write a
chapter (with no idea of the chapter's location in the
book, time of year, background of the characters, what
the plot was, etc.), and encouraged to write poorly."

The result can be found here:

Faustine


Of locks, Faustine.
Each side, Faustine.
Each week, Faustine.
To drink, Faustine,
For you, Faustine.

And keep Faustine.'
Long since, Faustine.
Far down, Faustine,
That won Faustine.

We see, Faustine.
In hell, Faustine.

We know, Faustine.
For you, Faustine.

Our sins, Faustine?
Twice crown Faustine.
The same Faustine.
Revived Faustine.

To soothe Faustine.
That galled Faustine.
All round Faustine.
That slew Faustine.

Are you, Faustine?
Forget, Faustine?
Your doom, Faustine.
The first Faustine.

>From his, Faustine.
Your face, Faustine.
A new Faustine.

In heaven, Faustine.
By night, Faustine.
The soul, Faustine.
That hid Faustine?

Of love, Faustine?
Caressed Faustine?
To spoil Faustine.
No more, Faustine.

Your lord, Faustine.
It seems, Faustine);
Your throat, Faustine,
Their shame, Faustine,
Or what, Faustine?

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT

KEEPING IT SIMPLE/LOOKING FOR THE LIGHT =AD PATRICIA SPEARS JONES
TUESDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 22ND
"The quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives has direct bearing
upon the product which we live...It is within this light that we form those
ideas by which we pursue our magic and make it realized. This is poetry as
illumination." =AD from =B3Poetry is Not a Luxury=B2 by Audre Lorde. =B3This is a
poetry workshop that takes the poetry of illumination to mean the poetry of
experience. How we scrutinize, how we elucidate our lives through words and
rhythms, how we make our poems bring new ways of thinking about our lives.
We will focus on the basics: line, stanza, cadence, meter, diction, syntax,
and point of view -=AD the elements that make a poem. We will also read
contemporary poets including Audre Lorde, Maureen Owen, Amy Gerstler, Shara=
n
Strange, Lee Young Lee, Jeanne Marie Beaumont, Frank O'Hara, Lorenzo Thomas=
,
and Bob Kaufman.=B2 Patricia Spears Jones is an award-winning poet and
playwright, and author of The Weather That Kills. Students must submit 5-10
pg. work samples before the class begins.

FINDING THE & THEN SOME THERE THERE =AD MERRY FORTUNE
THURSDAYS at 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 24TH
Film of Dreyer, writing of Mayer, painting of Traylor. An identifiable poet
=B3voice=B2 is a desirable, comfortable and utilitarian achievement. But what
potential or beautiful mystery lurks beyond carefully cultivated form,
tendency, technique, habit and boundary. Exploring the processes, qualities
and aesthetics of all art forms we will collectively discover commonalities=
,
and fearlessly apprehend what we may learn to expand our poetic values and
vocabularies as well as our very minds. Merry Fortune is the author of
Ghosts By Albert Ayler, Ghosts By Albert Ayler (Futurepoem).

HYPNOSIS AND CREATIVITY =AD MAGGIE DUBRIS
FRIDAYS AT 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 25TH
=B3Hypnotic and trance states have been used for centuries by shamans, mystic=
s
and visionaries. In this five week workshop, we will study techniques for
self-hypnosis that allow a writer to easily access the creative flow state.
We will explore the use of hypnotic tools to generate images, to increase
creative focus, to switch gears from a day job into writing, and to
circumvent creative blocks. We will also discuss the use of hypnosis to
vividly recall memories, and its use in conjunction with other creative
tools such as automatic writing.=B2 A $20 materials fee covers four of
Dubris=B9s hypnosis CDs, three of which are specifically geared to writing.
Maggie Dubris is the author of Skels (Soft Skull Press 2004), and Weep Not,
My Wanton (Black Sparrow Press 2002). She is also employed as a professiona=
l
hypnotist.=20


POETRY AND MUSIC =AD DREW GARDNER
FRIDAYS at 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN APRIL 8TH
=B3A workshop investigating the relation of music and poetry, comparing the
languages of poetry and music and asking questions about how they can be
combined and how they might illuminate each other. What are the poetic
implications of improvisation? What are the musical implications of everyda=
y
speech? What does our experience of poetry imply about how we experience
sound and how does our listening affect our writing? We will read and liste=
n
to Harry Partch, Morton Feldman, Leo Smith, Pauline Oliveros, Thoreau,
Nathaniel Mackey and others, keep listening notebooks and collaborate with
guest musicians. No musical background required.=B2 Drew Gardner is the autho=
r
of Sugar Pill (Krupskaya) and conducts the Poetics Orchestra, an ensemble
featuring poetry and structured improvisation.


A LAB: POST-CONCEPTUAL POETRIES =AD ROBERT FITTERMAN
SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 26
=B3What happens when we ask ourselves not if the poem =B3could have been done
better, but whether it could have been done otherwise=B2 (Dworkin). In
post-conceptual writing, the expression is realized in the process. This
workshop will be a hands-on writing lab. Each week we will write poems
in-class generated by borrowed models from contemporary, 21st Century
poetry. Some of these experiments might include: sampling, bastardization,
procedural writing, mixed media, collaboration, etc.=B2 Robert Fitterman is
the author of 9 books of poetry including: Metropolis XXX (Edge Books),
Metropolis 16-29 (Coach House Press) and Metropolis 1-15 (Sun & Moon Press)=
.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I'm looking for some help in identifying the source of a poem or some
ideas about how to continue my research.
My mother graduated from high school in Neligh, Nebraska, in 1931.
She always claimed she wrote a short poem, which has been published
many places since.  She said her English teacher sold it and didn't
tell you.

While my mother did continue to write some poetry throughout her
lifetime, there is no proof that she wrote this particular poem.  It
may have been something she heard, but came to believe it was original
to her.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
the poem:
"The gum-chewing girl and the cud-chewing cow
    are somewhat alike, yet different somehow.
What is the difference -- Oh, I see it now --
It's the intelligent look on the face of the cow."

My mother always hated gum chewing.

thanks,

birthday and the re-release of The Letters of Mina Harker (2004,
University of Wisconsin)

Joining Dodie will be Julia Bloch, Colter Jacobsen, Donal Mosher,
Aaron Nielsen, & Zakary Szymanski.

In Dodie Bellamy's imagined "sequel" to Bram Stoker's fin-de-si=E8cle
masterpiece Dracula, the plain Jane secretarial adjunct, Mina Harker,
is recast as a sexual, independent woman living in San Francisco in
the 1980s. The vampire Mina Harker, who possesses the body of author
Dodie Bellamy, confesses the most intimate details of her
relationships with four vastly different men through past letters.
Sensuous and captivating, The Letters of Mina Harker describe one
woman's struggles with finding the right words to explain her desires
and fears without confining herself to one identity.

"One of the most important novels of our time." - Dennis Cooper, from
the foreword

Well, we had a great happy trails event for Tom Nattell -- details
below in the Times Union (rather accurate) account of the event --
Pierre


A poetic farewell to Tom Nattell
By GREG HAYMES, Staff writer
First published: Wednesday, February 2, 2005

ALBANY -- There were political poems, environmental poems,
revolutionary poems. Poems about peace and about poetry itself.

There were poems by Tom Nattell, and poems about Tom Nattell.

More than two dozen Capital Region poets and musicians performed at
Tess' Lark Tavern on Monday evening for what was planned as the first
installment of "Poets Speak Loud," a new monthly series of open-mike
nights.

Nattell, the 52-year-old undisputed dean of the Albany poetry scene,
was slated to be the featured artist at the event. But after a long
battle with cancer, he passed away at his home Monday morning, and the
reading was transformed into a word-drenched wake, and a
standing-room-only celebration of Nattell's belief in the power of
poetry to build community.

Nattell, also a social and political activist, had hosted a monthly
open-mike night for poets at the now-defunct QE2 nightclub in Albany
for 10 years. He also hosted annual "Readings Against the End of the
World," as well as events for Poets Action Against AIDS.

In short, Nattell served as a friend and mentor to to nearly everyone
in the region who has stood in front of a microphone to pour out their
verse.

"This night was all about Tom Nattell, and it still is," said poet Mary
Panza, who co-hosted the festivities with Thom Francis. "We are here to
mourn his passing and celebrate his life."

The evening began with a recording of Nattell reading several of his
own poems, including "Frank Zappa Memorial Barbecue," which includes
the line "Frank Zappa is dead, but his music spins on."

Dan Wilcox, Don Levy, Cheryl Rice, Tess Lecuyer, R.M. Engelhardt, Emily
Gonzalez and other poets paid homage. Singer-songwriters Steve Candlen,
Kate McKrell and Times Union contributor Michael Eck offered musical
tributes. Caroline Johnston, better known as MotherJudge, delivered a
powerful a cappella rendition of "Amazing Grace," while performance
artist Nicole Peyrafitte accompanied herself with sleigh bells as she
praised Nattell's inspiring dedication and grace.

Throughout the evening, an empty beer pitcher was passed around,
filling up with $1, $5 and $10 bills. The proceeds were donated to the
Tom Nattell Peace Poetry Prize, an annual $200 award to an Albany High
School student for a poem that fosters a sense of social
responsibility.

Pierre Joris read eulogies from poets who were unable to attend,
including award-winning poet Anne Waldman. "Tom was a great light on
the scene," she wrote. " ... May his vision rekindle activist hearts
everywhere."

Nattell's son, Noah, read one of his father's poems, and Nattell's
longtime companion Mary Anne Winslow read the final entry from
Nattell's journal, which he wrote on Sunday: "Short or tall/Flowers are
wonderful."

After the readings had ended, Wilcox led a parade of three dozen into
Washington Park, stopping at its statue of the Scottish poet Robert
Burns. It was the spot where Nattell had hosted the "Poets in the Park"
reading series each July since 1989.

In the cold winter night, Peyrafitte kicked off her shoes and climbed
barefoot up the statue, adorning Burns' bronze head with a green beret
similar to the one that Nattell frequently wore. She placed a bouquet
of white roses in the statue's arms.

As the crowd cheered, Peyrafitte climbed down and lit a candle at the
foot of the statue.

Hi - I absolutely agree with you. What fascinates me is that - in order to
write to a disk, etc. - you need a stronger current or voltage than to
read; reading is a process that leaves the original alone. Yet reading in
a sense is all there is; the world is interpretable, and out of such
interpretation we construct meaning. But if we interfere too much,
interpretation is lost, meaning corrodes.

The originary texts of various monotheisms are thought impervious to
reading, to interpretation; they are there purely for the performative
telling - out of which stems the violence of the letter itself.

i wonder what would have happened
if we never got kicked out of PARADISE
she says- we wouldn't have multiplied
i ask - do you mean we'd never have sex? that we'd be extinct?
she says nothing.
i think - would adam & eve be the only 2 eternally?
the fire rages on t.v.
at the site where the plane tottered
from the runway
ending up in strawberry's
re-read that kafka story she tells me
i think he felt we...........oh i don't remember
it's a weird twist
let's read it together  i say

can't get my sentences straight
i'm
totally incomplete
this hospital light makes us all look sick
this skyline is
walked thru
flown thru
lit by the first signs of day
everything seems more like a reflection
than a shadow
the fire still rages
arms raised

reflecting on PARADISE is like walking
over a bridge in dense fog
even tho the day is brilliantly clear
it's like when a detective shadows a possible perp
without knowing all the facts
it's a painting by an old master
a passageway in the mind that ends in a mirror
which is mistaken for a door
it's like stock speculation
or privitization
it is like something we see so very clearly
without ever knowing
what it really is.

Haven't been there, Robin.  I think I'll stay away
from it.  humanities.lit.authors.shakespeare is enough
for me--although I also discuss the "authorship
question" with people at the Shakespeare Fellowship
website, where I've just been shown that Greene's
"Shake-scene" can't be the name of a person because
Greene capitalized many nouns in his book.

Agreed.  But I argue for the fun of arguing a nice
safe topic (unlike politics or religion).  I'm also a
Serious Investigator of Irrationality with a book
planned on the cerebral dysfunctionality of
anti-Stratfordians finished except for one last round
of polishing.

 Ah, but anti-Stratfordians have other qualities; my
book is about this particular one only.  Now stop
being mean to the poor people.  They're very

Been done -- inter alia, _Extraordinary Popular Delusions, and The Madness
of Crowds_ by Charles Mackay (1841).

Not to speak of (have I got the title right?) Sir Thomas Browne's _Pseudoxia
Epidemica_.

        Why reinvent the wheel?

                        <g>

Mind you, the Web has given a totally new spin to Conspiracy Theory ...

My favourite is how Scientology was constructed by not LRon but by Van Vogt
via Count Alfred Korzybski's _Science and Sanity_, and the Democrats are run
by Chomsky and the Institute of Scientology, with the Sokal Hoax (cf. the
British title, _Intellectual Impostures_) as a cover-text.

The current front-runner in these stakes in the UK is Opus Dei, which
crosses our Education Minister with The Da Vinci Code.

Apologies for the mass of emails this week -- it's really busy, and my lack

TONIGHT

ANSELM BERRIGAN AND STEFAN KIESBYE
Poetry and Fiction Reading
Friday, February 4, 8 p.m.
$4, $3 student, $2 members
The Hibiscus Room at Just Buffalo, Tri-Main Center, 2495 Main Street, Ste.
512

Anselm Berrigan is the author of Integrity & Dramatic Life and Zero Star
Hotel (both from Edge Books), and a CD (reading only) Pictures for Private
Devotion (www.narrowhouserecordings.com). Recent work can be found on-line
at www.gutcult.com and www.2ndavenue.com . He lives in New York City, where
he grew up, and is the Artistic Director of the Poetry Project at St. Mark's
Church-in-the-Bowery. He also lived in Buffalo from 1989-1993 while
attending UB.

Stefan Kiesbye was born on Northern Germany's Baltic coast and grew up in
West Berlin. He is a graduate of SUNY Buffalo and received an MFA in
Creative Writing from the University of Michigan. His novella, Next Door
Lived a Girl, was the winner of the 2004 Low Fidelity Press Novella Award.
His stories and poems have appeared in numerous magazines and anthologies.
He currently teaches writing at Eastern Michigan University and works as a
freelance writer.

TOMORROW

SPECIAL ONE-DAY POETRY WORKSHOP WITH ANSELM BERRIGAN

STITCHING TOGETHER A VOICE Saturday, February 5 12-4 p.m., $50, $40 members

I want to examine the artistic co-habitation of two apparently opposing
ideas: that every poet has a distinct voice, and that every voice is
constructed (a made thing). The idea being to put both notions to use in
order to write rich, long, complicated, independent-minded poems that handle
multiple subjects and that audiences want to read and hear. Another way of
putting it is looking directly at autobiographical material and external
(received, researched, appropriated, for starters) language and information
as capable of sharing the same space within poetic forms. Work by poets
Kevin Davies and Harryette Mullen involved. Participants should bring some
work in progress or notes or unfinished anythings to use as potential
material, and some reading materials of any types.

ALONG THIS WAY: STORYTELLING IN THE AFRICAN TRADITION
Saturday, February 5th, 2 P.M.
Buffalo and Erie County Central Library, 1 Lafayette Square, Buffalo
Free and open to the public

This annual fun-for-the-family program celebrates the African oral tradition
through stories, fables, folktales, epics, legends, songs, poems, and even
jokes. Featuring storytellers Sharon Holley and Karima Amin, drummer Eddie
Nicholson, and vocalist Joyce Carolyn.

TUESDAY -- PLEASE NOTE ACTUAL DATE AND TIME - REALLY, I MEAN IT

MS. FAT BOOTY AND THE BLACK MALE FEMINIST
A Talk by scholar Mark Anthony Neal
Tuesday, February 8, 7 p.m.
Langston Hughes Institute, 25 High Street, Buffalo
The event is free and open to the public.

A former graduate student in the Department of American Studies at the
University at Buffalo, Professor Neal is widely known for his provocative
perspectives on contemporary black life and his public lectures and
presentations on notable figures in black culture, from politicians to
popular music artists, including Tupac Shakur, Michael Jackson, Al Sharpton,
Meshell N'degeocello, Marvin Gaye, and Shirley Chisolm. He is the author of
four books: NewBlackMan: Redefining Black Masculinity (Routledge, 2005);
Songs in the Key of Black Life: A Rhythm and Blues Nation (Routledge, 2003);
Soul Babies: Contemporary Black Popular Culture and the Post-Soul Aesthetic
(Routledge, 2002); What the Music Said: Black Popular Music and Black Public
Culture (Routledge, 1998). Copies of Professor Neal's books will be

  Hi - I absolutely agree with you. What fascinates me is that - in =
order to
  write to a disk, etc. - you need a stronger current or voltage than to
  read; reading is a process that leaves the original alone. Yet reading =
in
  a sense is all there is; the world is interpretable, and out of such
  interpretation we construct meaning. But if we interfere too much,
  interpretation is lost, meaning corrodes.

  The originary texts of various monotheisms are thought impervious to
  reading, to interpretation; they are there purely for the performative
  telling - out of which stems the violence of the letter itself.

Ravi,

I have used Ginsberg's "America," as well as other poems of his, and some
of Gregory Corso in a course I teach on American Comedy and Satire.  Poems
by Dorothy Parker.  It depends on how broadly you define satire,
particularly if you consider Mennipean satire, but TS Eliot's "Prufrock"
would work, even "The Waste Land."  Lots of gentle satire in Kenneth Koch
and Frank O'Hara.  I also use Stein's "Tender Buttons" -- and talk about
satire of language (as well as language of satire), and I'm having students
read "Naked Lunch" to continue that discussion (in addition to other
issues).  Some of Emily Dickinson's poems have a satiric edge (although
she's always a special case), and then there are the sardonic poems of

In several of the poems in "Meadowlands" (Rainy
Morning) and "Vita Nova" (the closing poem of that
collection) Louise Gluck seems to me to be satirizing
herself.

But still if "reading is all there is" then writing is all there
is too.  I mean they only come together, no?

Can you 'read' an orgasm?  Isn't ecstatic experience often
pointed to as the origin of religious texts.  Then they
sometimes famously declare that the 'beginning' is pegged at the
transition to the social, when that experience gets put into
'the word.' It seems like a dominant thread of your (Alan's) own
writing seems to be a kind of biting the hand that feeds:  a
'readerly' assault on the syntax that's made by projecting
ecstatic experience into time, an attack on the root of 'the
strong's perogative.'

Doesn't it seem like reading changes writing and vice versa?
(It actually takes me quite a lot of energy to read some texts!)
But that's not the only feedback loop in town.  For one thing
there's textual corruption.  There's also performance which (as
David Larsen and Michelle Tea demonstrated last night at New
Langton Arts in SF) is more than speech.  And then also work in
film, music, etc that exceeds the written/read horizon.

Thinking of this relentless mill of response and intepretation,
i'm reminded of the end of a long line Kerouac's
   ' ... Lucien Midnight for my name,
and concocted up a world so nothing you had forever thereafter
make believe it's real.'

Subject: [call for proposals] VERSION >05 INVINCIBLE DESIRE

VERSION>05
APRIL 22- MAY 1, 2005
CHICAGO

Call for Proposals and Work

Deadline February 28, 2005

Version is a hybrid form of festival,
conference, arts fair and online
project. The fourth annual Version convergence
is an experimental approach
at navigating the activities of emerging
cultures that combine visual arts,
activism, social practices, creative use of new
technologies as well as
tactics and strategies of intervention.

Version>05>Invincible Desire
Version>05-Invincible Desire is a summit of the
underground and the
everyday.  Version>05 aims to practice, examine,
and strengthen the
activities of local configurations and their
external networks.  Version>05
is a drunken boat on a river whose flow has been
reversed by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers.

Driven by an irrepressible urgency for
intervention in the roaring bullshit
carnival that has become reality, Version>05
will investigate, debilitate,
and agitate contemporary US culture through a
diverse program featuring an
experimental art expo, artistic disturbances,
networked urban events,
screenings, interactive software applications,
performances, workshops,
parties and street action. We envision a New
Renaissance summit of
aggressive cultural workers organizing their
shared interests and networking
a distribution of ideas; a rendez-vous of
friends & lovers who?ve never yet
met.

We will convene in Chicago for a ten-day open
laboratory to explore a
diversity of tactics and strategies for
activating our communities,
amplifying our ideas, and ultimately creating
viable permacultures parallel
to consumer society =E2=80=93 and capable of superceding
it.  The city itself will
be used as a map to stage microactions.
Blueprints for strengthening
emerging alliances and counter-institutions will
be unveiled. Alternative
spaces will be open for staging actions. Public
space, corporate and
otherwise, will be our terrain of intervention.

Version>05-Invincible Desire is a cultural
summit and call for creating and
strengthening connections among artists,
writers, wingnuts, curators,
vigilante gardeners, activists, surrealists,
scientists, musicians, pirates,
filmmakers, activists, space hijackers, tactical
media provocateurs, radical
cartographers, students, designers, dreamers,
architects, adventurers,
critical thinkers and cultural workers of all
kinds.

Send us your critiques of the society of Control
and help us examine the
rhizomatic systems now confronting the
monoculture. We want to enlarge our
little utopias and expand participation across
today's multiple fronts of
countercultural emancipation and cultural
reclamation.

We dictate no format and only require your
desire to make it happen.

CALL FOR PROPOSALS AND WORK.

Not necessarily - re Foucault for example on divinatio, 'reading' the book
of nature. Stratigraphy is still treated that way informally. Writing
usually supposes intention; it's to some extent from the fallacy of
unintended writing that deity is presumed - someone had to write, to place
things in such a manner that interpretation is possible.

One can argue that the universe for example is information only, along the
lines of dna/rna, that fundamental particles can be 'exhausted' in terms
of ontology in relation to their parameteres (within probabilistic models
of coruse). But it's only 'information' in the reading; otherwise, it's
mute - and one can further argue perhaps that the reading itself is mute -
that the only 'thing going on' is the local assignation of meaning among
one or another group of organisms.

Well, I'm not sure that 'reading orgasm' is relevant? Or if it is, I'm not
sure how. I also haven't seen ecstatic experience as an origin of such
texts - more things like local explanation, fear of death, unexplained
catastrophes and the like. Certainly the word has had creative power
ascribed to it (which brings up a theme I talk about a lot, the
performativity of codework/computers in general); I think this stems from
the gestural content of early language or protolanguage - calling for
'help' or 'food' is identified with danger and nourishment in a deep way.

In my own work I see the simultaneities of reading/writing/machine/organ/
organism; I don't see the experience as ecstatic so much as supposedly or
abjectly ecstatic, replete with the fecundity of death. And yes, an attack
- I agree with you; otherwise we are silenced vis-a-vis the differend,
beneath the strong so to speak, not unlike what is happening to the
enunciation of the Democrats (sorry for the stupid phrase) at the moment -
dispersed, speaking weakly, effectively silenced.
>
> Doesn't it seem like reading changes writing and vice versa?

I'd say no, not necessarily; in fact writing, to the extent of the
stratigraphic (or even protocols) is necessarily obdurate, inert - to use
a phrase not mine (Rosset's) - 'idiotic' - it's there. It may or may not
have been intended. In codework reading/writing are tangled, complicit,
but even there, there's a release. In fact, even with interactive work,
the release holds; there's always power in the inscription - it was
William Gibson for example who, years ago, created a cdrom which could
only be played once.

Well, I don't doubt this about performance. I'm not so sure about film -
there's a discussion on empyre at the moment about the necessity of
archiving. Most human artifacts decay, but decay is also a reading of a
material condition; with Japanese wabi no sabi, one might take it to an
extreme and argue against decay even at the limits.

So it's complex - _if_ writing is humanly or organically/intentionally
inscribed, _then_ one can consider the interference of reading changing
the writing; I'd argue that author or not, Power is in the background, and
reading is always a lending-oneself-to the text at hand, just as in, say,
watching a film, one gives oneself up temporarily, not unlike on one hand
Coleridge's willing suspension of disbelief, or Bharata's idea of layered
coding producing meaning in the spectator.

Which is not to say that the interpretation of texts doesn't change over
time - or even texts - look at how variants of the Dao have changed as new
manuscripts have been discovered. Or Gnostic texts, Dead Sea Scrolls, etc.
- with these 'older' texts, always already palimpsests, there is always
the broken from the viewpoint of hermeneutics.

Again, though, even the collocation of early texts, say, of Genesis
(B'rashit) imposes a background of language, lettering, humans now
scurrying up whatever scaffolding remains.

That may be fascinating: but the voltage or current used to write to a disk
can't be compared to the energy used by the brain! They are very different
systems (perhaps very distantly analogous ) - but you are somehow using
the"model" of religions or religion with their - supposedly -
uninterpretible texts - impervious to reading - as a model to a  - say - the
reading of your own work  by those who take on the challenge -which is
pretty difficult if we are to "scan the disk" closely (and if scanned enough
and inetrpreted too much the 'data' may be corrupted )- or interpret or
explicate (as far as we can) the text - and its greater meaning in the order
of the greater "whole"of which that post was one part in the projectual jig
saw (as usual you are almost endlessly formally inventive and I feel you
have a great capacity with/for language -apart from the "meaning" (or
intention) or other of your text -
now if I was reading say John Ashbery for example I wouldn't really worry
too much about the complexities of (of the text in front of me) ( his
writing at best has a haunting quality  -in fact at its best it seems he is
talking to each reader - the reader feels it is he or she who is being
addressed...but he is very different kind of poet/writer) whether I needed
to interpret more or too much - in fact to better "read" writing such as
yours I have started reading some books referring to and or by Derrida (and
other related subjects)- so if I do get really into the great Sondeim
project you might be able to light up a city with my brain in action!

That is a stylistic or methodological  or philosophical (or even
metaphyical?) difference between you and say Nudel or Steve or probably
myself as I have written... your whole text seems to be - must surely
be? -determined almost to the last t or g or whatever (every "mark" every
grapheme? - there is nothing (?) aleatory in here if any - and you deny
"intuition"  (although - the meaning of that word is problematic) and so on

Something (has to?) catch the reader though - and on a superficial level the
enormous variations of your texts fascinate - in appearance (in some cases
literally the layout -and some of your visual images disturb - or
fascinate - and that is good - although some of he disturbing ones I
found/find very disturbing - that was interesting because I couldn't say
exactly why they disturbed..) and in tone and so on - language or  "timbre"
of each - the "voice" from each

Would you call yourself a kind of postmodern Pound or Zukofsky? (Not
comparing "levels" - just probing) The Great Postmodern Sondheimian Epic -
how will your project be named or  be referred to - or is naming out?

Whatever - keep sending -

So you really are 62 ? I just turned 57 !! On the 2nd of February - I was
born in 1948 - in Auckland, new Zealand, to English parents. I am glad they
came here as this country is a great country - and I have had a (mostly)
great life  -  it is possible to live well on a low income here... even on a
high income!! (If one is wise..)

Cheers -belated happy birthday!!

"Well, I don't doubt this about performance."

Isnt performance also a kind of complex language -part  of the larger "text"
?

 I'm not so sure about film -
there's a discussion on empyre at the moment about the necessity of
archiving. Most human artifacts decay, but decay is also a reading of a
material condition; with Japanese wabi no sabi, one might take it to an
extreme and argue against decay even at the limits."


Everything decays. [I think of Tennyson's poem - is it 'Tithonus' (he cant
die but continues to age) - The woods decay the woods decay and fall...And
after many a summer dies the swan".]

 In which case  - what do they mean  - "the  neccessity of  archiving?
you/they mean the necessity of good and or efficient archiving - literally -
all information storage systems corrupt  -so eventually all information -
everything - is obliterated. But you say that above - but  the or some of
the Japanese believe nothing decays...?

Does this connect to this  you said:

"In my own work I see the simultaneities of reading/writing/machine/organ/
organism; I don't see the experience as ecstatic so much as supposedly or
abjectly ecstatic, replete with the fecundity of death."

What do you mean by "the fecundity of death" .....
if there were no death - I believe - life would indeed be  terrible - but
why are you "abjectly ecstatic" - get aestheta-ecstatic man!! (Abject before
death? God? is there a God?)  For tommmorrow we die....

These are fascinating 'exaplantions' Alan -even your comments are poetic!

 Hmmm  - "reading an orgasm" (not your phrase i know) - I have experienced
some but never desired to read one!!

Aftershock

Of the huge dead. Of upscale retail centers in our city. Of closing loopholes
in the corporate tax code. Of course, we’d welcome these or any images

based on legislation passed in several states, or news that the Weather
Underground’s gift shop will remain open until 9 o’clock on warm summer

evenings. Far from charging sales taxes on the chemicals purchased by major
terrorists and agribusinesses, the government is thought to be preparing

a press release stating that it has no comment on that subject. Keeps our
economy and people moving, keeps one eye on the door, one foot on

the accelerator at all times—until offered a discount of 15% off the regular
admissions price for R-rated features. I particularly admired this old

hardware store with its nineteenth-century fixtures. He gently wipes it
with a tattered sleeve, saying, “I will be true to the wife.”

Because too many students threw pennies in the pool, its water
was no longer blue, and the conferees had to spend the night sleeping

on the hard-wood floor of the basketball court, tossing fitfully, dreaming
of road and site improvements that would cost 50 million to 75 million

dollars (not counting kickbacks). My dear, it is too late for peace, too
late for philanthropic phalaropes to adjust their lobate toes to current

market conditions. Down the wilde road the travelers proceeded, happy
to be on the move again after their enforced leisure caused by

drifting snow and a deliberate underfunding of public transportation.

A small Moment for a Huge Man


I touched his hand
Oh, a thousand years ago
now it seems
in mid-town

he leaped off the stage at final curtain
jumped down among us the awe-struck audience
shook our hands
smiled
put his huge arms around our shoulders
and as if it were he who owed us for his skills
he thanked us.

Imagine that, he thanked us...

"Thank you for coming," =20
and he still wore the tattered shirt;
he grasped hands
held eye-contact with perfect strangers
charmed us with both

I venture the thought -- sacrilegious though it might appear -- that our
ancestors who had a hand in the composition and editing of the text were
profoundly involved in work that entailed the sin of idolatry, worshippin=
g a
God of their own creation; and that many who live within the context of t=
heir
work may worship a God fashioned by human beings.  For today we are aware=
, as
the work of so many students of the Bible has indicated, that the shaping=
 of
the image of God in the text was a human enterprise.  If we are to regain=
 an
authentic religiosity, it is essential that we refrain from making images=
 of
God.  The nature of God must remain a mystery.  Should we, at any time, c=
ome
to feel that we have solved the mystery of the characteristics of God, th=
en,
indeed, would we be in sin.  Should we ever come to believe that we have
solved that mystery, all the refreshment of existence associated with hum=
an
religiosity will be gone.

sounds like worship of poetry = worship of god here

is it idolatry to think of the poem as more materialist than that? even to
want it to be more materialist than that? and if you want to center on what
happens when the poem is read (individually or communally) as what is
really important, that's fine. but does that have to be "the poem?" and do
i need to think of it as *worship?* that would ultimately seem to give the
poem a place beyond what i want to give it, beyond my own intervention,
beyond its status as object. yet it also lessens the poem, in favor of some
essential-ness beyond the poem, maybe some desire on the part of reader(s)
that may not have anything to do with the poem.

why can't "the text" remain "the text" without lessening all that happens
because of the presence of that text?

object of study, object of contemplation, object of interest, even object
of desire, yes all of these and more . . . but object of worship? i'm not
quite ready to go there.

That may be fascinating: but the voltage or current used to write to a disk
can't be compared to the energy used by the brain! They are very different
systems (perhaps very distantly analogous ) - but you are somehow using
the"model" of religions or religion with their - supposedly -
uninterpretible texts - impervious to reading -

=======I'm not saying the texts are uninterpretable at all - all there is,
in fact is interpretation. They're not impervious to reading; they're not
mutated, as material substrate, by reading, although they might physically
decay. What I'm saying is that the writing, even aleatoric or generative
writing, carries with it structure/scaffolding/authority, even if it is
destroyed in the reading, qua Gibson. The reading, which is the
formulation of meaning, hermeneutics, interpretation, is something else
altogether. I point to the 'reading' involved in stratigraphy or for
example DNA/RNA.

That is a stylistic or methodological  or philosophical (or even
metaphyical?) difference between you and say Nudel or Steve or probably
myself as I have written... your whole text seems to be - must surely
be? -determined almost to the last t or g or whatever (every "mark" every
grapheme? - there is nothing (?) aleatory in here if any - and you deny
"intuition"  (although - the meaning of that word is problematic) and so on

======= I agree but I think all texts are determined in this fashion, one
way or another. There's nothing truly random in Nudel or Steve - but let's
say there was - the very act of recording/setting it down, establishes a
text - there it is, written; it can be changed later by someone else, but
it's already got the handle of power, of authority...

Something (has to?) catch the reader though - and on a superficial level the
found/find very disturbing - that was interesting because I couldn't say
exactly why they disturbed..) and in tone and so on - language or  "timbre"
of each - the "voice" from each

====== For me, that's when an image 'works' for a viewer, when it opens an
anomalous space -

Would you call yourself a kind of postmodern Pound or Zukofsky? (Not
comparing "levels" - just probing) The Great Postmodern Sondheimian Epic -
how will your project be named or  be referred to - or is naming out?

====== I don't relate much to either... I'm reading parts of Dante's
Purgatorio (old Penguin translation) again... Look at Beatrice!

So you really are 62 ? I just turned 57 !! On the 2nd of February - I was
born in 1948 - in Auckland, new Zealand, to English parents. I am glad they
came here as this country is a great country - and I have had a (mostly)
great life  -  it is possible to live well on a low income here... even on a
high income!! (If one is wise..)

======= Happy birthday to you as well!

>From richard.tylr@XTRA.CO.NZ Sat Feb  5 07:01:48 2005

"Well, I don't doubt this about performance."

Isnt performance also a kind of complex language -part  of the larger "text"
?

======== I'd think it's a language the same way Christian Metz found film
a 'language' - which is to say highly problematic. But a film has
different archival issues of course than performance - or dance -
ironically perhaps only film can do them justice -

  In which case  - what do they mean  - "the  neccessity of  archiving?
you/they mean the necessity of good and or efficient archiving - literally -
all information storage systems corrupt  -so eventually all information -
everything - is obliterated. But you say that above - but  the or some of
the Japanese believe nothing decays...?

========= "necessity of archiving" is my phrase; I couldn't hold anyone
else to it. I just mean the archiving of digital media within digital
media, the archiving of the "Net" which is clearly one sort of image or
imaginary of our cultures...

"In my own work I see the simultaneities of reading/writing/machine/organ/
organism; I don't see the experience as ecstatic so much as supposedly or
abjectly ecstatic, replete with the fecundity of death."

What do you mean by "the fecundity of death" .....
if there were no death - I believe - life would indeed be  terrible - but
why are you "abjectly ecstatic" - get aestheta-ecstatic man!! (Abject before
death? God? is there a God?)  For tommmorrow we die....

====== Well, psychologically, depression enters into the picture, but
death is surely fecund, replete with potential, possibilities, moreso
perhaps than even sexuality, which revolves around a loose anthology of
scenarios. Death is that inconceivable blank; we write against it, but
also fill in so that there's witness after we're gone...

  Hmmm  - "reading an orgasm" (not your phrase i know) - I have experienced
some but never desired to read one!!

======= Actually I'd like to read one; some of the work in the ln or
l.txt done with Kim McGlynn deals with this.

I answered the query -- still not sure if I'll pursue or not -- but
seems decent

Catherine Daly



Thank you for contacting me regarding the ad for the Host Position

I've had such a great response, (god bless Craigslist), that I thought I
would send out this basic info-email and allow everyone to have a better
understanding of what's going on. I apologize for the "spam like" look.

Let me tell you about what I need.

Every week there will be a performance dedicated to the art of spoken
word / poetry. I'm a big stickler for creative freedom, SO the person
chosen will essentially have complete creative freedom and control of
this show. You will be picking the acts, scheduling the show, even
performing if you so choose. It would be like me giving you a theater to
express yourself and do whatever you want. I need someone who has a
passion and dream for a creative environment like this.

After you prove yourself, you will also be given special privileges for
the theater. If you want to start your own poetry / writers / music
workshop, you'll have a space to run it from. Have a full length script
you've always wanted to produce. I will help you there as well. There
are many possibilities and I love hearing new ideas.

Now let me see if I can talk you out of it.

It is a lot of fun, but there IS a little work involved. You are
responsible for the show going on. You have to meet with new up and
coming artists. You must give fair schedules to all performers. And I
have to be able to trust you with the door money knowing that you will
do the correct math and not lose any. There will be people that believe
you are the owner, and that's fine with me, but I need someone who is
going to have that kind of pride and passion to treat the theater like
they own it

I will give you the weekly time slot , space and facility to develop
your creative world. You must give me the assurance that the show will
go on every week. If you can't be there, then there should be a guest
host scheduled.

Tickets to every show will be $7.00. For every ticket sold, the theater
will take $5.00 and you will take $2.00. If you would like to set up a
concession stand and sell drinks & snacks. You will be able to keep any
and all profits from this. The theater can fit 50 to 60 people so there
is a little money that can be made. If the show does well, you will walk
with some serious pocket change. If the show doesn't do well..I will eat
the cost in the spirit of nurturing the night and allowing the project
to grow and build a following..

If you are responding to this in hopes of quitting the day job and
looking for the big bucks..delete this NOW. Go away! I'm not looking for
someone who is strictly money motivated. I will putting up the backing
of the facilities and long term support. I would (and most of the time
after all bills are paid) do this for free because this is my passion
and it's what I love.

So there you have it in a nutshell. Still there? Still interested?
GREAT. Then call me direct at 323-850-7827 and I'll set up a time for us
to meet and talk. If you have any further questions. You can ask them at
the website, (thus assuring that everyone gets all the info), located at
www.berubians.com . Just look for the link talking about poetry night
host and ask away!

I once again thank you for responding and I'm really looking forward to
getting this show started again.

Thanks!, and I'll talk to you soon

"Not necessarily - re Foucault for example on divinatio, 'reading' the book
of nature. Stratigraphy is still treated that way informally. Writing
usually supposes intention; it's to some extent from the fallacy of
unintended writing that deity is presumed - someone had to write, to place
things in such a manner that interpretation is possible."
[snip]

It may be that i get backed into an 'intelligent design'
position with what i wrote there.  My sense of reading is
reserved for what can be parsed, what has syntax, and i don't
think that exhausts experience.  That's why i have a
disagreement when you say 'in a sense, everything is reading.'
But you're correct, it's wrong to conclude if 'everything is
reading everything is writing,' and it should have concluded
"... everything is a text."

"Well, I'm not sure that 'reading orgasm' is relevant? Or if it is, I'm not
sure how. I also haven't seen ecstatic experience as an origin of such
texts - more things like local explanation, fear of death, unexplained
catastrophes and the like. Certainly the word has had creative power
ascribed to it (which brings up a theme I talk about a lot, the
performativity of codework/computers in general); I think this stems from
the gestural content of early language or protolanguage - calling for
'help' or 'food' is identified with danger and nourishment in a deep way."


I think that what you are referring to are certain
interpretations of why such texts exist (in an anthropological
framework).  But to take an example someone just this morning
reminded me about:  Joseph Smith's book founding the Church of
the LSD religion can be seen as 'local explanation' or it can be
seen as 'divine inspiration.' The question isn't what was in the
re-buried plates, but what to they represent?  My appeal to a
category of "ecstatic" is because it seems like something
everyone can be aware of -- hence the example of orgasm, and i
appreciate that could be extended as you suggest to any kind of
'dissolution' (or bardo) relating to death, fear, desire or
bliss. I just never would have the sense that i was
'interpreting' something like that, of course until later, after
it's gone.

To me the power aspect you rightly refer to is exercised at that
'after' moment (Lenny Bruce : "Didja come?  Didjacome?
Didjacomegood?"), when the experience is unpacked in time,
expressed, doubted or believed, whether it's a transition that
involved inscription, speech or action.  What is the special
nature of writing that you're trying to bracket?

"In my own work I see the simultaneities of reading/writing/machine/organ/
organism; I don't see the experience as ecstatic so much as supposedly or
abjectly ecstatic, replete with the fecundity of death. And yes, an attack
- I agree with you; otherwise we are silenced vis-a-vis the differend,
beneath the strong so to speak, not unlike what is happening to the
enunciation of the Democrats (sorry for the stupid phrase) at the moment -
dispersed, speaking weakly, effectively silenced."
[snip]

yes, agree, very clear.

> But that's not the only feedback loop in town.  For one thing

"Well, I don't doubt this about performance. I'm not so sure about film -
there's a discussion on empyre at the moment about the necessity of
archiving. Most human artifacts decay, but decay is also a reading of a
material condition; with Japanese wabi no sabi, one might take it to an
extreme and argue against decay even at the limits."
[snip]

I guess by 'corruption' i was thinking about mis-readings, or
typos mostly, noise on the line rather than material decay, and
with regard to performance i'm thinking how overdetermination of
text in performance feeds a text back onto itself, even while it
can be originary for me (if i don't have access to the script).
But let me be more specific about my concerns with 'everything
is reading.'

As a filmmaker what i'm most familiar with is experimental
cinema, about which it's odd to talk of texts, since the work
must be performed.  Because of this, though it is clearly
inscribed in dye patterns or magnetic patterns on a base strip,
it is farther out of reach than any written poem.  To use some
well known examples i'll refer to a difference between Vertov's
idea of a "kino eye" language, of truth (Pravda) through the new
organ of the camera/cinema, and Brakhage's work with images that
subvert the irresistible urge to read.

My pedestrian sense of what you say when you say 'everything is
reading' is that feeling i get of when i'm out and i see a sign
or something, a car door opening in front of me on my bike, or a
pile of dog shit on the sidewalk: i can't not read it, i know
what it means.  I've tried to train myself to not read and it's
like swimming against the tide.  On the other hand i've been
lost in Prague and Tokyo where i can't read the street signs and
been very scared ("water water all around and not a drop to
drink").  Watching Brakhage's films is like getting lost
without the ability to read anymore.   Vertov's (and allies like
Abigail Child) approach is different, trying to create a native
syntax for cinema so you can read and write new texts.  In
either case though, either you don't like them, you enjoy the
experience or you have a perverse desire to LEARN TO READ them.
I mean that in the positive sense of perverse.  What is the
state you're in before you learn to read?  (A less known example
of a different kind would be the films of Ernie Gehr, but that
would take us way far away from poetics.)

Of course there are levels of 'reading' -- like people can tell
it's a Brakhage film from the style -- but it seems there is
not-reading too, usually referred to as 'below' the level of
reading: an interesting spatialization of the relationship!  It
seems to relate to ideas of subconscious perception or
'phenomena' behind (again the spatial metaphor is interesting)
the representations of thought or experience.

So i think the idea of reading does imply an idea of writing
(perhaps agentless or intention-free, say in the way a
geographer reads a landscape or doctor an x-ray), but that in
any case that constitutes a HORIZON of experience.  And by THAT
spatial metaphor i mean to rely on the idea that 'living is
round' (to quote Trinh Min-ha) and there are things beyond the
horizon.


> i'm reminded of the end of a long line Kerouac's
>  ' ... Lucien Midnight for my name,
> and concocted up a world so nothing you had forever thereafter
> make believe it's real.'
>
"It's all real, it's all real -"

But the unreal way it's real is what i thought Kerouac pointed
out in that line.

          Balances


Gold is mute, the sea's white throat
collapses on itself, flowers are indifferent to
their purpose, but I say silence is its own topic.

It's like a gilded skull for drinking blood:
there is nothing to compare with such a draught
echoing in the hollow that once held its own.

Drinking blood then is a suggestion,
as is the gold on the bone.  Don't you understand
that the balances thus established make a request,

as if a crocus sprouted in the skull, or you heard
the sea within its nautiline curve, holding its cheek to yours,
or the words could be individually refilled with blood?

I can arrange them so that each matches up with another, or
I can make them all turn into one another, or
I can make each one the crown of all the rest, but

I cannot cross the gap between whatever I make of them
and the nervous tree rooted in the mud that is
the same for everyone, and you cannot get here to help me.    =

From konrad@PANIX.COM Sat Feb  5 19:08:53 2005

It may be that i get backed into an 'intelligent design'
position with what i wrote there.  My sense of reading is
reserved for what can be parsed, what has syntax, and i don't
think that exhausts experience.  That's why i have a
disagreement when you say 'in a sense, everything is reading.'
But you're correct, it's wrong to conclude if 'everything is
reading everything is writing,' and it should have concluded
"... everything is a text."

Even vision starts with retinal learning; the body itself is enfolded,
encoded. The universe is syntactic, structured. -

"Well, I'm not sure that 'reading orgasm' is relevant? Or if it is, I'm not
sure how. I also haven't seen ecstatic experience as an origin of such
texts - more things like local explanation, fear of death, unexplained
catastrophes and the like. Certainly the word has had creative power
ascribed to it (which brings up a theme I talk about a lot, the
performativity of codework/computers in general); I think this stems from
the gestural content of early language or protolanguage - calling for
'help' or 'food' is identified with danger and nourishment in a deep way."

I think that what you are referring to are certain interpretations of why
such texts exist (in an anthropological framework).  But to take an
example someone just this morning reminded me about:  Joseph Smith's book
founding the Church of the LSD religion can be seen as 'local explanation'
or it can be seen as 'divine inspiration.' The question isn't what was in
the re-buried plates, but what to they represent?  My appeal to a category
of "ecstatic" is because it seems like something everyone can be aware of
-- hence the example of orgasm, and i appreciate that could be extended as
you suggest to any kind of 'dissolution' (or bardo) relating to death,
fear, desire or bliss. I just never would have the sense that i was
'interpreting' something like that, of course until later, after it's
gone.

=== I was thrown off by "LSD religion"; you mean LDS! A huge difference.
We're moving away; I didn't say that there are no ecstatic experiences;
we're talking about the origin of (religious) texts. Smith's vision is
just that, a vision, highly structured, and in fact the question is I
think precisely what's in the plates.

For that matter, orgasm is also a form of inscribing, I think; it's highly
specific, chemically bound, triggered, etc. The fact that it appears
transcendent or enveloping doesn't contradict this.

To me the power aspect you rightly refer to is exercised at that
'after' moment (Lenny Bruce : "Didja come?  Didjacome?
Didjacomegood?"), when the experience is unpacked in time,
expressed, doubted or believed, whether it's a transition that
involved inscription, speech or action.  What is the special
nature of writing that you're trying to bracket?

====== Nothing in particular; I never said that writing had a "special
nature." I simply gave a structured priority to writing over reading, even
though the two may seem inextricably entwined. Again, an aleatoric work is
still bound by the author, one way or another; even if the work is
deliberately unbound, the unbinding itself is an authorial process. The
reading which may or may not alter the text is a scanning hermeneutics;
the two aren't equivalent, which, to get away from orgasm and back to hard
drives, is why there are different voltages applied; if they were equal,
reading and writing would result in deeply unreadable results.

> But that's not the only feedback loop in town.  For one thing
> there's textual corruption.  There's also performance [snip]
> film, music, etc that exceeds the written/read horizon.
"Well, I don't doubt this about performance. I'm not so sure about film -
there's a discussion on empyre at the moment about the necessity of
archiving. Most human artifacts decay, but decay is also a reading of a
material condition; with Japanese wabi no sabi, one might take it to an
extreme and argue against decay even at the limits."
[snip]

I guess by 'corruption' i was thinking about mis-readings, or typos
mostly, noise on the line rather than material decay, and with regard to
performance i'm thinking how overdetermination of text in performance
feeds a text back onto itself, even while it can be originary for me (if i
don't have access to the script). But let me be more specific about my
concerns with 'everything is reading.'

As a filmmaker what i'm most familiar with is experimental cinema, about
which it's odd to talk of texts, since the work must be performed.
Because of this, though it is clearly inscribed in dye patterns or
magnetic patterns on a base strip, it is farther out of reach than any
written poem.  To use some well known examples i'll refer to a difference
between Vertov's idea of a "kino eye" language, of truth (Pravda) through
the new organ of the camera/cinema, and Brakhage's work with images that
subvert the irresistible urge to read.

==== I also work in experimental cinema, and I don't think it's odd to
talk of texts at all; why also must the work be performed? Is Vertov a
performance? Are all screenings performances? If I show films, say, at
Millennium (here), I'm showing films. I may involve them in performance, I
may even perform them, I may do a Jack Smith with or without them, etc.
But it's not odd to talk of text at all.

As far as Brakhage goes, of course they're read; the shapes, if not
abstract, are identified, there's a development based even on entry/exit
of the venue, etc. Kino eye language is way different, it's a language in
a sense of design, more likely given within Metz's analyses.

My pedestrian sense of what you say when you say 'everything is reading'
is that feeling i get of when i'm out and i see a sign or something, a car
door opening in front of me on my bike, or a pile of dog shit on the
sidewalk: i can't not read it, i know what it means.  I've tried to train
myself to not read and it's like swimming against the tide.  On the other
hand i've been lost in Prague and Tokyo where i can't read the street
signs and been very scared ("water water all around and not a drop to
drink").  Watching Brakhage's films is like getting lost without the
ability to read anymore.  Vertov's (and allies like Abigail Child)
approach is different, trying to create a native syntax for cinema so you
can read and write new texts.  In either case though, either you don't
like them, you enjoy the experience or you have a perverse desire to LEARN
TO READ them. I mean that in the positive sense of perverse.  What is the
state you're in before you learn to read?  (A less known example of a
different kind would be the films of Ernie Gehr, but that would take us
way far away from poetics.)

======= First, for me there's no native syntax at all of cinema, not even
in materialist/structuralist experimental work. But you're using reading
in a very very narrow sense. It's not necessarily symbolic, linear; it's
cognitive processing. Zen works without this, but Zen also has specified
vocabulary, often overlooked; it too is structured, and authority courses
through Zen like a river.

One reads from birth; smiles are interpretable, etc. As far as Tokyo goes
- I can only speak of Fukuoka, without romaji at all - but one reads to
the extent that the signs are ciphers; one doesn't "read" the signs in the
sense of understanding the Japanese, but they're part of a configuration
of a landscape - like stratigraphy again - that one processes, learns to
read one way or another. On the other side lies anger, catatonia.

Of course there are levels of 'reading' -- like people can tell it's a
Brakhage film from the style -- but it seems there is not-reading too,
usually referred to as 'below' the level of reading: an interesting
spatialization of the relationship!  It seems to relate to ideas of
subconscious perception or 'phenomena' behind (again the spatial metaphor
is interesting) the representations of thought or experience.

===== Subconscious perception - Pribram's retinal learning, Marr's 2, 2.5
d processing, Land's stuff on color perception, etc. etc. - it's all
processing; it's just not conscious; it still reading/interpreting. It's
interesting to look at the old text of Hadamard's on The Psychology of
Mathematical Thinking in this regard.

So i think the idea of reading does imply an idea of writing (perhaps
agentless or intention-free, say in the way a geographer reads a landscape
or doctor an x-ray), but that in any case that constitutes a HORIZON of
experience.  And by THAT spatial metaphor i mean to rely on the idea that
'living is round' (to quote Trinh Min-ha) and there are things beyond the
horizon.

====== Here I can only disagree; we're bound by our hermeneutics,
including the hermeneutics of the body.

> i'm reminded of the end of a long line Kerouac's
>  ' ... Lucien Midnight for my name,
> and concocted up a world so nothing you had forever thereafter
> make believe it's real.'
>
"It's all real, it's all real -"

But the unreal way it's real is what i thought Kerouac pointed
out in that line.

====== I can't answer for Kerouac of course; the line sees capable of any
number of readings. -

====== I do want to add here that I think far too much is made of the
"death of the author" or the postmodernity of fluid texts - both of which
are partially "true" - but what's overlooked is the very authority of
texts, even given multiple and partial interpretations, readings, etc.
etc. I'm more aware in hypertext that I'm bound by the author, in fact,
than I am in a traditional novel; in the latter, the diegetic allows me to
be involved in the "world" created between writer and reader, but in
hypertext, the choices are always already limited, given as such, and the
control of the author becomes apparent. We're seeing today with all forms
of religious fundamentalism - the authority of the text, and its playing
out - and the authority that inheres in what's called the fundamentalist
notion of textual inerrancy. I also feel all of us - myself included -
look for precisely non-readable/non-writable (for that matter) experiences
- and there seem to be many, from sexuality to mysticism; but I think it's
also important to recognize the syntactics and semantics of those experi-
ences - again, there's a sense of power, and, at least for me, inerrancy
that must be deconstructed. Such deconstruction doesn't point to a
specific reading of a specific text, but a field of readings over and
through a field of texts, and the deployment of power across and through-
out both. And it's too easy, at least for me, at this point, to speak of
reading and writing as similar or simultaneous, etc. - most reading and
writing parallels, say, Deleuze on sadomasochism - which doesn't break
down necessarily into dialectic or opposition, but the play of powers
within what might be vastly different regimes.

- Alan, thanks for the reply!

Last Letter from Gol.Com
I'm out of gol.com, my Japanese account. I closed it down a week early.
Although they have touted themselves as far ahead of panix in my corres-
pondence with them, they have repeatedly damaged their own shell accounts.
They switched machines without telling anyone at times - rendering void
email lists which rely on correct addressing. They got rid of emacs quite
a while ago, allow no traceroute, ping, netstat, or any sort of perl and
other programming - as far as I could tell, only simple shell programs
would run. They change things without advance notice - including time-
consuming machine repairs that they knew of in advance. I'd dial in and
find the account inaccessible. At one point, they removed Pine - I had to
switch to elm; they removed elm - I had to switch to mail. All this with-
out notice. Of course they removed /usr/games etc. Finally, they kept
reconfiguring Pine, the mailer - at this point, I couldn't even change my
name. They set more and more of the so-called user options. And again, all
of this without advance warning. [And Pine is now misconfigured, with an
error message concerning file permissions appearing every time someone
logs in.]

Psydchoanalysis, like all good science fiction, involves the rigid
application of an invented generative hypothesis. "If it aint" would throw
the whole thing into a cocked hat. What's needed to render such theoretical
games anything more than a rhetorical exercise is an exploration, not an
unquestioned, or even a for-the-sake-of-argument, acceptance, of the
hypothesis. You haven't done this, nor, for that matter, did Freud, who
seemed to think that the metaphors that helped him explain his own emotions
to himself were universal. One's self is an excessively small sample.

A good methodology would be "if you think you know something throw it out
and observe instead."

You should know, by the way, that outside of the increasingly small circle
of psychoanalysis Freud isn't taken very seriously by students of psychology.

Perhaps your definition of satire would be useful in thinking about
whether appropriate examples from poetry exist. I can think of
innumerable examples of what I'd call satire, from Dryden, Pope,
Byron, Carroll, Calverley, the Carryls, Owen Seaman, FP Adams, Newman
Levy, Dorothy Parker, Arthur Guiterman, John Updike, John Betjeman,
Frank Jacobs, A D Hope, whose "The Kings" is a brutal indictment of
modern society, which I include below, and even Robert Frost -- his
"Etherealizing" I also include below because it seems to be so little-
known, and other examples of the other writers on request.

The Kings
A D Hope

The lion in deserts royally takes his prey;
Gaunt crags cast back the hunting eagle's scream.
The King of Parasites, delicate, white, and blind,
Ruling his world of fable even as they,
Dreams out his greedy and imperious dream
Immortal in the bellies of mankind.

In a rich bath of pre-digested soup,
Warm in the pulsing bowel, safely shut
>From the bright ambient horror of sun and air,
His slender segments ripening loop by loop,
Broods the voluptuous monarch of the gut,
The Tapeworm, the prodigious Solitaire.

Alone among the royal beasts of prey
He takes no partner; no imperial mate
Seeks his embrace and bears his clamorous brood.
Within himself, in soft and passionate play,
Two sexes in their vigour celebrate
The raptures of helminthine solitude.

>From the barbed crown that hooks him to his host,
The limbless ribbon, fecund, flat, and wet,
Sways as the stream's delicious juices move;
And, as the ripe joints rupture and are lost,
Quivers in the prolonged, delirious jet
And spasm of unremitting acts of love.

And Nature, no less prodigal in birth
In savage profusion spreads his royal sway:
Herds are his nurseries till the mouths of men,
At public feasts, or the domestic hearth,
Or by the hands of children at their play,
Transmit his line to human flesh again.

The former times, as emblems of an age,
Graved the gier-eagle's pride, the lion's great heart,
Leviathan sporting in the perilous sea;
Pictured on History's or the Muse's page,
All knew the King, the Hero, set apart
To stand up stiff against calamity,

Breed courage amid a broken nation's groans,
Cherish the will in men about to die,
Chasten with just rule a barbarous tribe
And guard, at last, the earth that kept his bones.
And still the Muse, who does not flatter or lie,
Finds for our age a symbol to describe

The secret life of Technocratic Man:
Abject desire, base fear that shape his law,
His idols of the cave, the mart, the stye --
No lion at bay for a beleaguered clan,
No eagle with the serpent in his claw,
No dragon soter with his searing eye,

But the great, greedy, parasitic worm,
Sucking the life of nations from within,
Blind and degenerate, smug in excrement,
"Behold your dream!" she says, "View here the form
And mirror of Time, the Shape you trusted in
While your world crumbled and my heavens were rent."


Etherealizing
Robert Frost

A theory if you hold it hard enough
And long enough gets rated as a creed:
Such as that flesh is something we can slough
So that the mind can be entirely freed.
Then when the arms and legs have atrophied,
And brain is all that=92s left of mortal stuff,
We can lie on the beach with the seaweed
And take our daily tide baths smooth and rough.
There once we lay as blobs of jellyfish
At evolution=92s opposite extreme.
But now as blobs of brain we=92ll lie and dream,
With only one vestigial creature wish:
Oh, may the tide be soon enough at high
To keep our abstract verse from being dry.

"...outside the increasingly small circle of psychoanalysis, etc"

This is only because Freud,  in psychology, like Newton in physics,
Popular interest in Freudian thinking has been coming and going since
the publication of *The Interpretation of Dreams* over 100 years ago. Freud
brought so many psychological concepts into the popular foreground-
(repression,"Freudian slips",  projection, the unconscious, the importance
of' childhood and sexuality in everyday life,  the significance of
narcissism, the neurotic foundations of war, etc, etc) that saying he is no=
t
taken seriously is becoming one of those increasingly "cool", yet tiresomel=
y
incorrect contemporary clich=E9s. Lots of people question Darwin also right
now, even going to the point of forbidding discussion of evolution in the
classroom. People have been claiming the death of psychoanalysis since its
birth, for many varying reasons. Of course Freud is taken seriously in an
historical way as one of the founders of modern psychology. Virtually every
supporter of managed care likes to encourage medication over long or even
short term therapy. They don't approve of Freud either. They are also
frequently mistaken, though, of course, there have also been many abuses of
long term psychotherapy as well. Psychoanalysis may not be fashionable righ=
t
now-neither is liberalism. That doesn't mean it isn't important. It
doesn't mean its day is over, either.

"...outside the increasingly small circle of psychoanalysis, etc"


Popular interest in Freudian thinking has been coming and going since
the publication of *The Interpretation of Dreams* over 100 years ago. Freud
brought so many psychological concepts into the popular foreground-
(repression,"Freudian slips",  projection, the unconscious, the importance
of' childhood and sexuality in everyday life,  the significance of
narcissism, the neurotic foundations of war, etc, etc) that saying he is no=
t
taken seriously is becoming one of those increasingly "cool", yet tiresomel=
y
incorrect contemporary clich=E9s. Lots of people question Darwin also right
now, even going to the point of forbidding discussion of evolution in the
classroom. People have been claiming the death of psychoanalysis since its
birth, for many varying reasons. Of course Freud is taken seriously in an
historical way as one of the founders of modern psychology. Virtually every
supporter of managed care likes to encourage medication over long or even
short term therapy. They don't approve of Freud either. They are also
frequently mistaken, though, of course, there have also been many abuses of
long term psychotherapy as well. Psychoanalysis may not be fashionable righ=
t
now-neither is liberalism. That doesn't mean it isn't important. It
doesn't mean its day is over, either.

Alan et al

The wonder of my financial satus is that I think I owe about NZ$5000 (two
credit cards) (although I amost paid a third one off) and on my cheque
account I am at least (minus) NZ$900 (in overdraft)  -   I also owe another
NZ$500 for the balance of a new computer - and i dont know how much I owe my
"book buyer"  outgoings are endless - rates/water rates/power/telephone and
internet/groceries (including the cat !!)/petrol for my old "bomb"/
registration and WOF for said bomb/ postage costs/fees to abebooks about
NZ$80 a month at least /fees to eftpos (varies) if there are any book sales/
payments on another loan - balance ~NZ$3000/student loan  (owe Govt about
NZ$4000)  - other - get about NZ$ (all about in NZ$164 a week and some extra
from book sales (total of which amounts to just making it to to get some
groceries etc or maybe to buy a book ocsasionally - otherwise have to borrow
or ("find") a book)) -

BUT - nothing has really changed since about 1987 when I left my 'proper'
employment -

All of which reminds me of the Monty Python skit about how hard things were
in :"the good old days" -

"I had to get up at 5 am to milk the cows"  .. and " I only got $50 a week"
...  " Yes, but I had to get up at 3 am"  " I only get paid $1 a week".... "
Yes but I had to pay my boss to work!..it was hard in them days!!" and so
on...
Alan  - you will never be rich hunkered down there in Boston with your books
and computers and and your calculus of cyber thought =  the body/text etc
etc etc etc etc etc etc and so on and so on and so on and so on - and your
great (and small) tomes, your readings of Deridda and film theory and
physics and theatre and cybernetics - no money in it my boy!!  Dontkick
againts the pricks!! its neen tried!! No future - get real job!!

At least you write poetry or do something  - I dont write unless I think I
am going to read to a (present )public or i know someone is interested in
publishing and lately feel that everything I have ever written is possibly
crap - that said - I feel great!!   And always seem to be busy - despite
being - officially - on 'welfare'....My project at the moment is to get fit
and lose weight!! So as I am more or less healthy and happy i dont have much
"drive" to write etc (maybe should try some testosterone -saw a progamme on
that - even women are using it to 'get drive'! (to do well in business etc))
although I still read poetry etc...but sometimes wonder why I am on here - i
suppose its curiosity ..there is some interesting poetry on here - yours
particulary  - but others of course...

(In Montaigne he quotes how Caesar was asked persmission of an old soldier
that he be able to take his own life - Caesar replied - "Why ask? - You are
already dead!!"....- sometimes I feel like the old soldier - in a happy kind
of way!!

You can be sure Alan - lets be serious - that   - 100 years after you are
dead - there will be a huge industry of Sondheimiania (as there is now one
devoted to such as Joyce and Pound) - with Sondehmian poetics in
hyperspace/hypertext (something with an abstruse or modish appelation)  and
there will be thousands - nay billions - of PhDs written scribed or texted
on your great project - like James Joyce: with his immense tantalising
seemingly endlessly convoluted and labyrinthine and virtually
(uninterpretable?..well incomprehensible for most people) Finnegans Wake -
you will have defeated death !! Sidestepped the "Great Grim One".

And anyone caught being merely happy - or not booked up on his
Sondheimanism - will have to watch out for his (and or her) neck!!!!  Dont
worry about that - you have the authorial power me lad! (your absence shall
disturb!)

 "Look on the bright side of life...dah de da!" (The Life of Brian)

Perhaps your definition of satire would be useful in thinking about
whether appropriate examples from poetry exist. I can think of
innumerable examples of what I'd call satire, from Dryden, Pope,
Byron, Carroll, Calverley, the Carryls, Owen Seaman, FP Adams, Newman
Levy, Dorothy Parker, Arthur Guiterman, John Updike, John Betjeman,
Frank Jacobs, A D Hope, whose "The Kings" is a brutal indictment of
modern society, which I include below, and even Robert Frost -- his
"Etherealizing" I also include below because it seems to be so little-
known, and other examples of the other writers on request.

The Kings
A D Hope

The lion in deserts royally takes his prey;
Gaunt crags cast back the hunting eagle's scream.
The King of Parasites, delicate, white, and blind,
Ruling his world of fable even as they,
Dreams out his greedy and imperious dream
Immortal in the bellies of mankind.

In a rich bath of pre-digested soup,
Warm in the pulsing bowel, safely shut
>From the bright ambient horror of sun and air,
His slender segments ripening loop by loop,
Broods the voluptuous monarch of the gut,
The Tapeworm, the prodigious Solitaire.

Alone among the royal beasts of prey
He takes no partner; no imperial mate
Seeks his embrace and bears his clamorous brood.
Within himself, in soft and passionate play,
Two sexes in their vigour celebrate
The raptures of helminthine solitude.

>From the barbed crown that hooks him to his host,
The limbless ribbon, fecund, flat, and wet,
Sways as the stream's delicious juices move;
And, as the ripe joints rupture and are lost,
Quivers in the prolonged, delirious jet
And spasm of unremitting acts of love.

And Nature, no less prodigal in birth
In savage profusion spreads his royal sway:
Herds are his nurseries till the mouths of men,
At public feasts, or the domestic hearth,
Or by the hands of children at their play,
Transmit his line to human flesh again.

The former times, as emblems of an age,
Graved the gier-eagle's pride, the lion's great heart,
Leviathan sporting in the perilous sea;
Pictured on History's or the Muse's page,
All knew the King, the Hero, set apart
To stand up stiff against calamity,

Breed courage amid a broken nation's groans,
Cherish the will in men about to die,
Chasten with just rule a barbarous tribe
And guard, at last, the earth that kept his bones.
And still the Muse, who does not flatter or lie,
Finds for our age a symbol to describe

The secret life of Technocratic Man:
Abject desire, base fear that shape his law,
His idols of the cave, the mart, the stye --
No lion at bay for a beleaguered clan,
No eagle with the serpent in his claw,
No dragon soter with his searing eye,

But the great, greedy, parasitic worm,
Sucking the life of nations from within,
Blind and degenerate, smug in excrement,
"Behold your dream!" she says, "View here the form
And mirror of Time, the Shape you trusted in
While your world crumbled and my heavens were rent."


Etherealizing
Robert Frost

A theory if you hold it hard enough
And long enough gets rated as a creed:
Such as that flesh is something we can slough
So that the mind can be entirely freed.
Then when the arms and legs have atrophied,
And brain is all that's left of mortal stuff,
We can lie on the beach with the seaweed
And take our daily tide baths smooth and rough.
There once we lay as blobs of jellyfish
At evolution's opposite extreme.
But now as blobs of brain we'll lie and dream,
With only one vestigial creature wish:
Oh, may the tide be soon enough at high
To keep our abstract verse from being dry.

another type of satire is Menippean satire. I believe that the etymology
of the word, satire, leads to medley. So a satire is a medley of styles.
I've always thought that The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is great example.
Verse, biblical inversions, prose, collapse of ancient and contemporaneous
personages, open parody, the list goes on. Hetrogeneous polyvocal
.
Bakhtin writes on satire.

sounds interesting,

Cognition and language are the crown of human evolution. How we  use them
will determine our progress or decline as a species. Poetry is  as adequate a
form of communication as any other. Sometimes oblique or  obscure poetry is fun,
intriguing, because we must pay attention to the poet and  not just his text
or art. Poems need the context of the poet. T.S. Eliot  disagreed, but that's
okay. Sometimes isn't always, and all ways  are toward. If they're not forward
in the least, they're no thing.  Even fun can be progress.

Under Which Lyre
WH Auden

Ares at last has quit the field,
The bloodstains on the bushes yield
        To seeping showers,
And in their convalescent state
The fractured towns associate
        With summer flowers

Encamped upon the college plain
Raw veterans already train
        As freshman forces;
Instructors with sarcastic tongue
Shepherd the battle-weary young
        Through basic courses.

Among bewildering appliances
For mastering the arts and sciences
        They stroll or run,
And nerves that steeled themselves to slaughter
Are shot to pieces by the shorter
        Poems of Donne.

Professors back from secret missions
Resume their proper eruditions,
        Though some regret it;
They liked their dictaphones a lot,
They met some big wheels, and do not
        Let you forget it.

But Zeus=92 inscrutable decree
Permits the will-to-disagree
        To be pandemic,
Ordains that vaudeville shall preach
And every commencement speech
        Be a polemic.

Let Ares doze, that other war
Is instantly declared once more
        =91Twixt those who follow
Precocious Hermes all the way
And those who without qualms obey
        Pompous Apollo.

Brutal like all Olympic games,
Though fought with smiles and Christian names
        And less dramatic,
This dialectic strife between
The civil gods is just as mean,
        And more fanatic.

What high immortals do in mirth
Is life and death on Middle Earth;
        Their a-historic
Antipathy forever gripes
All ages and somatic types,
        The sophomoric

Who face the future=92s darkest hints
With giggles or with prairie squints
        As stout as Cortez,
And those who like myself turn pale
As we approach with ragged sail
        The fattening forties.

The sons of Hermes love to play,
And only do their best when they
        Are told they oughtn=92t;
Apollo=92s children never shrink
>From boring jobs but have to think
        Their work important.

Related by antithesis
A compromise between us is
        Impossible;
Respect perhaps but friendship never:
Falstaff the fool confronts forever
        The prig Prince Hal.

If he would leave the self alone,
Apollo=92s welcome to the throne,
        Fasces and falcons;
He loves to rule, has always done it;
The earth would soon, did Hermes run it,
        Be like the Balkans.

But jealous of our god of dreams,
His common-sense in secret schemes
        To rule the heart;
Unable to invent the lyre,
Creates with simulated fire
        Official art.

And when he occupies a college,
Truth is replaced by Useful Knowledge;
        He pays particular
Attention to Commercial Thought,
Public Relations, Hygiene, Sport,
        In his curricula.

Athletic, extrovert, and crude,
For him, to work in solitude
        Is the offense,
The goal a populous Nirvana:
His shield bears this device:  mens sana
        Qui mal y pense.

Today his arms, we must confess,
>From Right to Left have met success,
        His banners wave
>From Yale to Princeton, and the news
>From Broadway to the Book Reviews
        Is very grave.

His radio Homers all day long
In over-Whitmanated song
        That does not scan,
With adjectives laid end to end,
Extol the doughnut and commend
        The Common Man.

His, too, each homely lyric thing
On sport or spousal love or spring
        Or dogs or dusters,
Invented by some court-house bard
For recitation by the yard
        In filibusters.

To him ascend the prize orations
And sets of fugal variations
        On some folk-ballad,
While dietitians sacrifice
A glass of prune-juice or a nice
        Marsh-mallow salad.

Charged with his command of sensational
Sex plus some undenominational
        Religious matter
Enormous novels by co-eds
Rain down on our defenceless heads
        Till our teeth chatter.

In fake Hermetic uniforms
Behind our battle-line, in swarms
        That keep alighting,
His existentialists declare
That they are in complete despair,
        Yet go on writing.

No matter; He shall be defied;
White Aphrodite=92s on our side:
        What though his threat
To organize us grow more critical?
Zeus willing, we, the unpolitical,
        Shall beat him yet.

Lone scholars, sniping from the walls
Of learned periodicals,
        Our facts defend,
Our intellectual marines,
Landing in little magazines
        Capture a trend,

By night or student Underground
At cocktail parties whisper round
        From ear to ear:
Fat figures in the public eye
Collapse next morning, ambushed by
        Some witty sneer.

In our morale must lie our strength:
So that we may behold at length
        Routed Apollo=92s
Battalions melt away like fog,
Keep well the Hermetic Decalogue,
        Which runs as follows:

Thou shalt not do as the dean pleases,
Thou shalt not write thy doctor=92s thesis
        On education,
Thou shalt not worship projects nor
Shalt thou or thine bow down before
        Administration.

Thou shalt not answer questionnaires
Or quizzes upon World-Affairs,
        Nor with compliance
Take any test.  Thou shalt not sit
With statisticians nor commit
        A social science.

Thou shalt not be on friendly terms
With guys in advertising firms
        Nor speak with such
As read the Bible for its prose,
Nor, above all, make love to those
        Who wash too much.

Thou shalt not live within thy means
Nor on plain water and raw greens.
        If thou must choose
Between the chances, take the odd:
Read The New Yorker, trust in God;
        And take short views.

Ernst Mayr
Veteran biologist who synthesised Darwin's theory of evolution and
Mendel's theory of heredity
ERNST MAYR devoted eight decades to the systematic study of the natural
world that he learnt to love as a boy growing up in Bavaria before the
First World War. He began as an ornithologist, became an evolutionist, and
in later life developed his interests in the philosophy of biology. His
longevity and his appetite for work enabled him both to establish a
prominent place in the history of 20th-century evolutionary biology, and
to write that history himself.

In an essay marking his 100th birthday, which fell last July, Mayr
described himself as "the last survivor of the golden age of the
evolutionary synthesis". That process, which occupied the middle decades
of the past century, integrated two theories which had originated in the
middle of the century before: Darwin's theory of evolution by natural
selection, and Mendel's theory of heredity.

Much of the credit for it has conventionally been awarded to geneticists,
whose methods were mathematical, but Mayr challenged their significance. A
naturalist and a confirmed non-mathematician, he insisted that the
geneticists had only addressed the question of how organisms become
adapted to their conditions of life. For the synthesis to be complete, it
needed to incorporate the question of how new species are formed. It was
this dimension of the synthesis which Mayr helped to clarify, most notably
in his landmark book Systematics and the Origin of Species (1942).

In particular, Mayr explained the "biological species concept", a view of
species not as forms defined by a collection of attributes but as
populations of interbreeding organisms. He emphasised the role of
geographical isolation in the formation of new species: when parts of a
population became physically separated, they would take different
evolutionary paths, and would eventually become incapable of
interbreeding. In this he followed his mentor, Erwin Stresemann; both in
the concept itself, which he considered to have been held by Stresemann
and other German ornithologists, and in his conviction - not typical of
the age in which he was formed - that biology should be a theoretical
discipline as well as a project to accumulate facts.

Ernst Walter Mayr was born in Kempten, Bavaria, in 1904. His love of
nature was inculcated by his father Otto, a judge, on Sunday natural
history excursions, and later his family's tradition of medical practice
guided him to medical studies - though his choice of university,
Greifswald, was influenced by the likelihood that the local bird life
would be interesting. He made contact with Erwin Stresemann, who was
curator of birds at the University of Berlin Museum of Natural History, to
report a sighting of rare ducks, and in 1925 moved to Berlin, where
Stresemann supervised his PhD. Mayr completed his doctoral thesis the
following summer, at the age of 21, and became an assistant at the museum.

He followed the tradition of the great Victorian naturalists by going on
formative expeditions in his youth, followed by long years studying
specimens. In 1928 he went to New Guinea to collect for Lord Walter
Rothschild's museum at Tring, Hertfordshire, and the American Museum of
Natural History, then joined the museum's Whitney expedition further east
in the Solomon Islands. Surviving tropical diseases and other hazards - a
highly premature report of his death claimed that he had met his end at
native hands - he returned to Berlin in 1930. In 1931 he sailed to the US,
to take up a post at the museum in New York. Rothschild's collection of
280,000 bird specimens followed him not long after - Rothschild sold it to
the museum in the face of blackmail demands arising from an affair.
Curating this collection was Mayr's main responsibility for the next 20
years.

In 1935, Mayr married Margarete (Gretel) Simon. Their marriage lasted 55
years, until her death in 1990.

Mayr left the natural history museum in 1953 to become Alexander Agassiz
Professor of Zoology at the Harvard University Museum of Comparative
Zoology. He stayed at Harvard for the rest of his life, serving as the
director of the MCZ from 1961 to 1970, and becoming Professor Emeritus in
1975.

He projected his vision of biology and his role in its development in the
historical and philosophical ventures he undertook from the 1970s onwards,
from the historical and biographical essays in The Evolutionary Synthesis,
which he co-edited with the historian of science Will Provine, through the
900 pages of his 1982 book The Growth of Biological Thought, to the
articles and books he wrote in his nineties.

These later works summarise the persistent themes in his thought,
expressed with characteristic directness and conviction. He asserted the
importance of naturalists such as himself in the development of
evolutionary theory. Naturalists, he considered, were disposed to
recognise that natural selection acts on individual organisms rather than
individual genes. Mayr's view of the evolutionary geneticists' project, in
which they used mathematics to treat individual genes in isolation, was
expressed in the phrase "beanbag genetics". Swimming against one of the
most powerful currents in modern biology, much of which now deals with
molecules rather than organisms, he rejected reductionism wholesale.

In this, as in his vision of biology overall, he was a self-consciously
continental thinker, holistic in inclination and schooled in the
importance of systematic classification. His historical commentaries
asserted the significance of scientists from a continental European
background, most of all the Russian-born Theodosius Dobzhansky, whose 1933
paper on variation in beetles provoked Mayr to exclaim: "Here is finally a
geneticist who understands us taxonomists!"

In relocating across the Atlantic, however, Mayr left behind the Central
European philosophical tradition of idealism, whose notion of ideal types
he saw as an obstacle to the concept of species as populations of varying
individuals. He maintained a commitment to German natural history, and
acquired a following in the country of his birth.

After the war, he and his wife Gretel supported his colleagues in Germany
by sending them journals as well as food parcels. Meanwhile, in his
adopted country (he and Gretel became US citizens in 1950) he founded the
journal Evolution in 1947.

As a professor he was American in his informality, in striking contrast to
the strict hierarchies that still endured back in Europe. One of his
former students recalls how, on a visit to France, Mayr deliberately
contrived to shock his hosts by engaging in debate with his junior
colleague on first-name terms.

Over the course of his career Mayr supported and guided many younger
colleagues - most dramatically to New Guinea, in the case of Jared
Diamond, whom he met when Diamond was a teenager, and Mayr worked with his
father on the role of natural selection in the evolution of blood groups.
In 1971, they began a project which eventually resulted in their book The
Birds of Northern Melanesia (2001).

Ernst Mayr remained an ornithologist and a systematist even after he had
turned to history and philosophy. All these fields were unified by his
understanding of evolution.

Mayr's many honours include the Japan Prize, the Balzan Prize and the
Crafoord Prize, one of the most prestigious international awards open to
biologists. His tally of productivity includes the description of 26
species and 473 subspecies of birds previously unknown to science, and 25
books, the last of which (What Makes Biology Unique) he completed in time
for his centenary, 81 years after his first publication. He is survived by
his two daughters.

Ernst Mayr, biologist, was born on July 5, 1904. He died on January 3,
2005, aged 100.

Educate and Liberate!
Raza Studies Program
Spring Semester 2005

The Raza Studies Program/Somos Raza (youth organization) was founded in
1987
by Union del Barrio.  The objectives of the program are:

1. Educate/Inform young people about Raza History, Politics, and Culture.
2. Through Raza Studies create/instill pride and positive self-esteem among
Raza youth.
3. Create unity among Raza youth and end the mindless violence that takes
place daily throughout the Barrios of Aztlan.
4. Assist/Motivate young Raza to continue their education (high school,
college, etc.).
5. Raise the social consciousness of youth and get them involved in the
struggle for Raza self-determination (create progressive social activists).
6. Prepare other to become Raza Studies instructors and teachers.

For almost two decades, the Raza Studies Programs have been held in various
barrios of San Diego:  in schools, community youth centers, and at Union
del
Barrio headquarters.

This Springâ€™s Raza Studies Program is being organized in a â€œround table
discussionâ€ (circulo de discusion) format/structure; an a guest
presenter is asked
to give comments on a particular issue and everyone is encouraged to asked
questions or give comments (feed back). We are currently on our third
session of
the Raza Studies Program Spring Semester 2005.  The first session was an
introduction to the program and our last session was titled â€œISSUES
FACING YOUTHâ€
(which took place on Feb. 2).

The third session of the spring semester will take place at 5 PM,
Wednesday 9
, at the Yo Spot Youth Center, located on the corner of 41 and Market
St, San
Diego.    The session is titled â€œWhy Some Raza Youth End Up In Prison
and The
Reality of Prison Life".

Franciso Soto, who has done time in youth detention facilities, as well as
State and Federal Prisons, and is currently a member of the Chicano
Mexicano
Prison Project (CMPP), will be the guest presenter for this session.
Francisco
will speak from a Chicano Mexicano self-determination perspective.

Learn.  Become an activists.  Support the Struggle.  Participate in the
Raza
Studies Program.

Venceremos!

I stand by my last sentence. Even in analytic training institutes it's=20

None of which means that people who believe Freud's theories can't be good=

regardless of how they explain to themselves why they're doing them. Nor=20
does it mean that Freud's work has no historical significance, and for some=

it remains a useful set of metaphors.

Regardless, Norman O. Brown's application of psychoanalytic theory, which=20
is where we started, is absurdly reductive.

Lots of satyrical subject line poetry here cropping up.

Alan wrote:
>> Even vision starts with retinal learning;

All i can say is: learning WHAT?  I realize that the piece you
posted that started this had partly to do with the assertion of
power through definitive against interpreted readings of
religious texts (among other things).  And, sorry, i didn't mean
to put words in your mouth like 'there is no ecstatic
experience' or 'the essence of writing.'  But then i didn't
commit to saying there was a 'native syntax' for film, but
rather that that was someone's project.

The point about bringing up Joseph Smith (or Moses, or any of
the discoverers of Terma, buried Tibetan religious texts --
sometimes they're said to be 'buried' in peoples' minds!!!) is
that there is The Book of Mormon and there are the Golden Plates
that got reburied.  The reason i say 'it doesn't matter' what's
on the plates is that they are not a reference, they are a
cypher, a placeholder for something beyond the grasp of the
Book, which is a translation (only non-believers believe he
wrote it from scratch). The book de-marks the interface between
his visionary experience and the exfoliation of that into a
text.  But that's still a DNA metaphor -- i need something else
to get at what i mean, but it's not possible: i need a metaphor
with only one term!

One thing that interests me about, uh ... "experimental" cinema
(music, dance): it's a laboratory for inter-media translation,
that ekphrastic transition to language in trying to talk about
it.  Of course this makes everything into a text :( so it's
apropos of what you're saying with "it's also important to
recognize the syntactics and semantics of those experiences,"
except that you said that with respect to mystical or ecstatic
experiences rather than aesthetic ones.  But the reason i find
it a lab, is that it's a sheltered environment to examine how
really incommensurate realms interact.  My sense is there is a
gap between  experience and language, that even writing is a
kind of reading, so talking/writing about non-verbal work is
like practice in dealing with life. (This view brings the critic
down a notch.)

I understand that you're saying that experience IS structure
(syntax), i.e. that that is the equivalent of 'everything is
reading.' Perhaps i misunderstand.

My sense is that 'experience without structure' is the
experience of being a 'conduit' or what many poets and seers
have described as being a vehicle for some kind of transmission,
though you don't have to be one to experience it.  Hell, even
George W Bush thinks he talks to God.  But that's the issue
you're getting at, isn't it?

I'm way with you regarding the 'death of the author' as an echo
of the Death of God.  But i'm way against you regarding cinema.
Every unreeling is a performance.  I experience every
re-screening as irreducibly different, even though some may fall
into families of similar events.  On top of that the film
'exists' in the memories of spectators more unavoidably than a
poem 'exists' in the memory of readers, since a poem's text is
much more available to look up.

To me the priority (authority, power) you suggest writing has,
using the metaphor of voltage required to inscribe a magnetic
trace, could also be inverted to show that the Achilles Heel is
having no eraser.

Is the rubber heel a solution?

Ten Sentences on Robert Creeley

"What is poetry which does not save / Nations or people?"
-Czeslaw Milosz

Let's read "I Keep to Myself Such Measures" as a description of
Creeley's writing process or poetic practice.

In the lines 'The mind... puts in place of it... simple markers'
Creeley represents the possibility of returning to and revising the past
through writing, but since ultimately 'All forgets,' this action
remains futile.

A world in which 'all forgets' refuses a firm ground for knowledge,
making decisive action difficult.

'My mind sinks,' Creeley writes, descending into a half-lit realm
where both transcendence and revelation become impossible.

Weighted down by a consciousness whose thinking can only lead in the
direction of the 'less tangible,' the less substantive, Creeley's
verse continually circulates through an omnipresent forgetfulness; he
uses it to drive his poems forward.

Since 'form is never more than an extension of content' as we
learned via Olson in his "Projective Verse," what we find in the figure
of Creeley is a man mired in an inability to overcome himself, to make a
statement, to make poetry.

"I was always leery of claiming to be a 'poet...'" Creeley admits
in a recent interview.

As Bataille writes in the essay "The Notion of Expenditure:" 'The
term poetry... can be considered synonymous with expenditure; it in fact
signifies, in the most precise way, creation by means of loss.  Its
meaning is therefore close to that of sacrifice.'

Since Creeley sacrifices nothing, gives nothing away, and in fact
insists he has nothing to give, can his work truly be considered poetry?


Despite the fact that Creeley's formal innovations have changed the
face of American poetic practice, we must yet determine what value this
work might hold for us today.

I sincerely appreciate Mark Weiss' patient and considered responses to my
huffy statements. His original point, that I was responding to here, implie=
d
that Freud's contributions are now considered insignificant, historically,
in psychology. This is incorrect. Also, the main reason that analytic
institutes and analysts in private practice don't get as many referrals at
they used to is managed care, not the ups and downs, in academia, and among
critics of the field, as to the significance of psychoanalysis. Managed car=
e
proponents are well aware of the convictions of psychoanalysts about the
necessity, in some cases, of long term psychotherapy; they don't like it
because they want to save money for insurance companies. This is an
understandable conflict. I have also been inside the profession for a long
time, in fact, over 20 years. I, as well as others, have noted countless
successes, along with numerous failures, of all kinds of psychotherapy
treatment. By the way, this is true of any kind of treatment, from
cardiology to dermatology, so it's no reflection on Freud at all. He himsel=
f
was cautious, and says so in his published writings, as to the probable
successes of psychoanalytic treatment (see, "Psychoanalysis Terminable and
Interminable.") The significance of the unconscious, of the ego defenses,
and so many other contributions of psychoanalysis are very well recognized,
and were and are debated, as well. My point about Darwin was to illustrate
the fact that because something is contested, it doesn't mean it isn't
valid. Everyone now recognizes that psychoanalysis cannot be considered
"hard science." But it is, frankly, short sighted to attempt to obviate the
psychological and cultural contributions of Freud's ideas. The fact that
they are contested, that the debates remain alive, within and without the
profession, is a sign of life, not death. Like many types of  poetry,
Freudian ideas continue to engender fierce and interesting debates,
loyalties and disavowals. What else is new?

There's a lot of huffiness on both sides whenever discussions of=20
psychological theory come up, and I apologize for my own. But I'll stick=20
with what I thought was my original point (I never said anything about the=
=20
historical significance of Freud), however badly put: one can base an=20
argument about any aspect of human behavior on a Freudian construct, but=20
one cannot do so as if that construct was a scientific given, as evolution=
=20
by natural selection is.

Mark.

And then a different light:

"Managed Care"....now there's a health industry oxymoron worthy of =
adding to your vocabulary.  And wouldn't you just know it's a phrase =
created by the insurance industry.=20

Of course, one must look to the bright side of the insurance equation.  =
Zillions of folks in the nation take bazillions of dollars worth of =
medicines daily attempting to maintain some semblance of sanity and =
health.  Those medications are not covered by Medicare.  However, the =
current administration has seen fit to add Viagra costs to the "covered" =
list of treatments Medicare will pay for.  (Is there a presidential =
moment hidden behind this choice for the administration?)

No, we won't pay for your prozac or for your trip to the naturo-path for =
calming sedative herbs and balms, but rest assured, we will pay to =
repair your erectile dysfunction so you can continue to screw as ye are =
screwed...ah, sweet poetry of life, at last we have found you. =20

  I sincerely appreciate Mark Weiss' patient and considered responses to =
my
  huffy statements. His original point, that I was responding to here, =
implied
  that Freud's contributions are now considered insignificant, =
historically,
  in psychology. This is incorrect. Also, the main reason that analytic
  institutes and analysts in private practice don't get as many =
referrals at
  they used to is managed care, not the ups and downs, in academia, and =
among
  critics of the field, as to the significance of psychoanalysis. =
Managed care
  proponents are well aware of the convictions of psychoanalysts about =
the
  necessity, in some cases, of long term psychotherapy; they don't like =
it
  because they want to save money for insurance companies. This is an
  understandable conflict. I have also been inside the profession for a =
long
  time, in fact, over 20 years. I, as well as others, have noted =
countless
  successes, along with numerous failures, of all kinds of psychotherapy
  treatment. By the way, this is true of any kind of treatment, from
  cardiology to dermatology, so it's no reflection on Freud at all. He =
himself
  was cautious, and says so in his published writings, as to the =
probable
  successes of psychoanalytic treatment (see, "Psychoanalysis Terminable =
and
  Interminable.") The significance of the unconscious, of the ego =
defenses,
  and so many other contributions of psychoanalysis are very well =
recognized,
  and were and are debated, as well. My point about Darwin was to =
illustrate
  the fact that because something is contested, it doesn't mean it isn't
  valid. Everyone now recognizes that psychoanalysis cannot be =
considered
  "hard science." But it is, frankly, short sighted to attempt to =
obviate the
  psychological and cultural contributions of Freud's ideas. The fact =
that
  they are contested, that the debates remain alive, within and without =
the
  profession, is a sign of life, not death. Like many types of  poetry,
  Freudian ideas continue to engender fierce and interesting debates,
  loyalties and disavowals. What else is new?

By "retinal learning" Pribram was referencing that there are no incoming
"raw data" - that the retina itself processes and encodes information
before it's sent to the brain. And if you look at the various receptors in
the eye - some are set for motion, some for static information, etc. It's
all active processing.

Not sure what you're referencing here. But the plates, aren't they more
than a placeholder or cypher? They're also the punctum, the power source -
they're the credibility.

I pretty much agree with you here. And yes, everything _is_ a text, but
the written text, the labanotation of the dance, for example - what I'm
saying is that the text is somewhat independent, the harboring of
authority. And I'd argue further that there is no gap between experience
and language in the broader sense. Of course in the narrow sense -
difficult for example to translate a mountain hike into english, not to
mention music, film, etc. But by 'language' I'm referencing cog sci here -
languaging in fact is what makes experience qua experience; otherwise it
would be a rock on that hike, nothing more.

Well, at my end, first, I can and do look up my own video as fast as a
piece of writing; this is an attribute of the increasing ease of data
storage. But no, watching a film isn't a performance in the sense I
thought you were using. It's in fact being locked in to cinematic time,
projector time, the authority of the predetermined psychoanalytics and
mechanics of the editing. I thought you were referencing things like Jack
Smith which were in part at the least improvisational, difficult to
record. With traditional film, there's even an ur-text, the archival
negative. Now interesting enough I think, early film was different; in the
"silent" (not really) era (not really), the projectionist would improvise
the hand-cranking speed to transform the time of the frames into something
fluid and tuned to the action. This would of course also occur through
over- or under-cranking when the film was made. Fluid times transformed
into fluid times. The orchestra or other soundwork followed suit.

Yes, or that erasure is another authority in itself. That's why all those
texts "under erasure" or with struck-out lines still visible, in say the
theory of the late 70s through 80s, still conveyed authority, the author
having it "both ways."

Another example occurred often with net sex using ytalk or talk in unix -
a partner would write a line - the other would see the line as it was
being written across the screen - and then the line would suddenly be
erased - as if it were the _wrong_ line - but appearing long enough to
create a seduction, a trembling, in the other who watched the wisp of
language under transformation.

Please join us for an exciting Washington,
DC, Poetry Event on Friday, February 11th at
7:30 pm. The Lucifer Poetics Group, a
NC-based affiliation of artists, will be
reading at The Flea in Friendship Heights.


The Flea is located 4604 N. Park Ave, a few
blocks north of the Friendship Heights Metro.
A map is available at
http://users.erols.com/friendshiphtsvillage/AboutCommty.html#PFO
The Flea is roughly where Number 11 is. Call
202-210-5623 with questions.


The Lucifer Poetics Group is a loose
affiliation of poets who mostly reside in and
around North Carolina, and describe
themselves as follows: "We have no, nor seek,
a specific aesthetic agenda: our collective
is strongest when splintered.  Collaboration
sometimes occurs and involves, inevitably,
organs of influence.  We have no relationship
  -- stated, contracted, enforceable, nor
traceable -- with the idea often referred to
  as Satan.  Our only shared belief is that
poetry is a group activity."


The list of readers:


Marcus Slease is a native of Portadown, N.
Ireland but is currently a resident alien.
His blog is http://marcusslease.blogspot.com


Todd Sandvik lives and writes in Carrboro,

Tony Tost is the author of Invisible Bride. A
chapbook, World Jelly, is forthcoming from
Effing Press this year.  His blog is

Brian Howe is a freelance music critic and
poet from Carrboro, NC. He contributes
regularly to Pitchforkmedia.com and Paste
Magazine, and his poems have appeared in
Eratio and Pedestal. He is currently reading
all the Brian Evenson he can get his hands
on, and trying to devise new ways to make
machines write poems for him.


Ken Rumble is the director of the Desert City
Poetry Series and list administrator for the
Lucifer Poetics Group.  His poems have been
published or are forthcoming in NoTell Motel,
Effing Magazine, Sidereality, Drunken Boat,

a storm of quotation marks
now rests in puddles, you've
lost all coyness, Wormswork,
that you must storm down...
you'll not lay devised marks?
we're confined to mouthfuls of
quotation marks which have
nothing to do with Wormswork's
warm-blooded grandeur... when
the storm struck we were long past
flinches, and certainly unprepared for
running and hiding... our mouthfuls
WERE to be distributed to a still-wearier
crowd that waits on that red bell
announcing the arrival of a strom of
quotations marks... if that crowd has
not more luck than us, then the next
crowd's crowd perhaps... even with
our forebears, village errors broke apart,
yes, yes, whenever they thought of us,
and we've learned to think ahead even more
--> the marks puddle in the trench we've dug
above the elm-tops... a comma? 'twas recess...

I too have a "ghosted" Indian ancestor.  We don't know exactly how she
obtained her American maiden surname "Christian" - though we do know many
Indians were "given" this same last name.   She was Cherokee, from the
border area of Tennessee/Virginia - Bristol.  The Cherokees were
horrifically "removed" from this area in 1838.  Who knows under what
circumstances she and her parents lived there in the 1850's when she was
born.  There are some things we know about her later life, as my father knew
her.  My poem for her, "blood," was published by Minotaur Press (Jim Gove).


Excerpt from "blood":


what lay in your heart
               what lay in your dark eyes
               the dark Indian eyes
as you knew and felt the folly
what did you not say?

how hard was it
to give it all up
how hard was it
to keep it
               to keep your Indian
                              beneath the covers
                              beneath your clothes
                              beneath your face and smile

Thanks for posting this, Alan. Like no doubt many on this list, I have
several "ghosted' Indians in my family ancestry. I used to think that was a
romantic point of honor. Until I read the history of how Native American
women and children were abducted and either "married" or "raised" by white
men and families.
I think this persons approach of tribal "associates" is a good one,
undoubtedly, beset with difficulties as well. Annually, at the end of
February I go to Eureka, California to the tribal and the larger community
mourning of the 1863 massacre of Wyots on Indian Island and simultaneously,
the celebration of the Wyot New Year. My step-grandmother was part Wyot -
her grandmother and grandmother's sister were both kidnapped and enslaved by
white families in the 1850's. I was close to my step grandmother,
Assimilation? Indeed. We never spoke about being part Indian.  In the
Thirties she was a member of the Heritage Book Club - I still keep her case
bound copies of Conrad's Argosy and Alexander Pope's translations of the
Iliad and the Odyssey - the Pope, by the way, is not readable! However, I
keep them as they remain emblematic of a time.
It is forever interesting to me - the ghosted memories (Indian or not) that
run under the radar of most educations, as well as families.

I offered the Norman O. Brown quote here because I thought it has a strik=
ing
and specific relevance to contemporary poetics.  Brown wrote that some
"linguistic analysts have had the project of getting rid of the disease i=
n
language by reducing language to purely operational terms."  It seems to =
me
that some contemporary American poets have engaged in a similar project t=
o
create a poetry which uses language purely operationally, and for the sam=
e
reason:  as part of what Wittgenstein called philosophy's "battle against=
 the
bewitchment [Verhexung] of our intelligence by means of language."

I think that this project, as Brown also says of the project of the lingu=
istic
analysts he mentioned, will fail because it is impossible, and anyway wou=
ld be
pointless if it succeeded.  As Brown says, "a purely operational language=

would be a language without a libidinal (erotic) component; and psychoana=
lysis
would suggest that such a project is impossible because language, like ma=
n,
has an erotic base, and also useless because man cannot be persuaded to
operate (work) for operation's sake."  For "language" in the foregoing
sentence substitute "poetry," and you can take it as a critique of certai=
n
current avant-garde poetics.

Poetry, like psychoanalysis, should begin where Wittgenstein ends.  A
Wittgensteinian poetics will result only in an aridly endless restatement=
 of
the problem, but what the poet must provide is a solution.

Michael,
Hurtful question this!  Of course there are both poets and pigs in Iowa. =
 The real question is which of the two voted blue?

I might be able to find one or two for you... What's this project about
again?

In fact there are far more pigs than poets in Iowa and far more corn than
both combined (rumor has it, though, that the pigs eat it and the poets
produce it).

Great suggestions, all; glad to have such a wealth of material to choose =

of my own as due recompense-=20

-RS  =20


Ten Truisms and a Lie
=20
Spatulas make passable flyswatters.
On average, double coupons mean twice as much.
To make a monkey a man, offer a cigarette.
Orange is the new pink; pink was the new black.
Punk rock panders.
Sour cream and onion sells more than salt and vinegar.
Some prefer bromides to platitudes.
The phrase, irony is based on misrelationship discovered
by the =91I=92 between existence and the idea of existence, is =
plagiarized.
Aristophanes meant well when he put Socrates in a basket.
Even the mullet has risen!



And from Instrumentality-

The Flock=92s Reply to the Passionate Shepherd
         After Christopher Marlowe
=20
Marooned upon this grassy knoll,
We wander lost from vale to pole,
Our wooly backs resemble thorn,
It=92s been a while since we=92ve been shorn.

You waste much time trying to woo
That nymph who never will see you.
Since it=92s a shepherd that you are,
You=92re better off courting a star.
=20
But over here, your loyal flock
Needs no clasp, no precious rock
To follow you from field to field:
If love=92s your need, we can but yield.
=20
Have you not heard us cry and bleat
When you approach us, then retreat?
We miss your orders and your laugh,
We even miss your clouting staff.

If such delights your mind might move
Then live with us and be our love.

(To JS/07 M 378
This Marble Monument
Is Erected by the State)

He was found by the Bureau of Statistics to be
One against whom there was no official complaint,
And all the reports on his conduct agree
That, in the modern sense of an old-fashioned word, he was a
   saint,
For in everything he did he served the Greater Community.
Except for the War till the day he retired
He worked in a factory and never got fired,
But satisfied his employers, Fudge Motors Inc.
Yet he wasn't a scab or odd in his views,
For his Union reports that he paid his dues,
(Our report on his Union shows it was sound)
And our Social Psychology workers found
That he was popular with his mates and liked a drink.
The Press are convinced that he bought a paper every day
And that his reactions to advertisements were normal in every way.
Policies taken out in his name prove that he was fully insured,
And his Health-card shows he was once in a hospital but left it cured.
Both Producers Research and High-Grade Living declare
He was fully sensible to the advantages of the Instalment Plan
And had everything necessary to the Modern Man,
A phonograph, a radio, a car and a frigidaire.
Our researchers into Public Opinion are content=20
That he held the proper opinions for the time of year;
When there was peace, he was for peace:  when there was war, he went.
He was married and added five children to the population,
Which our Eugenist says was the right number for a parent of his
   generation.
And our teachers report that he never interfered with their
   education.
Was he free? Was he happy? The question is absurd:
Had anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard.

MIME-Version: 1.0

For myself, I cannot live without my art. But I have never placed it above
everything. If, on the other hand, I need it, it is because it cannot be
separated from my fellow men, and it allows me to live, such as I am, on one  level
with them. It is a means of stirring the greatest number of people by
offering them a privileged picture of common joys and sufferings. It obliges the
artist not to keep himself apart; it subjects him to the most humble and the
most universal truth. And often he who has chosen the fate of the artist because
 he felt himself to be different soon realizes that he can maintain neither
his  art nor his difference unless he admits that he is like the others. The
artist  forges himself to the others, midway between the beauty he cannot do
without and  the community he cannot tear himself away from. That is why true
artists scorn  nothing: they are obliged to understand rather than to judge. And
if they have  to take sides in this world, they can perhaps side only with
that society in  which, according to Nietzsche's great words, not the judge but
the creator will  rule, whether he be a worker or an intellectual.

By the same token, the writer's role is not free from difficult duties. By
definition he cannot put himself today in the service of those who make
history;  he is at the service of those who suffer it. Otherwise, he will be alone
and  deprived of his art. Not all the armies of tyranny with their millions of
men  will free him from his isolation, even and particularly if he falls into
step  with them. But the silence of an unknown prisoner, abandoned to
humiliations at  the other end of the world, is enough to draw the writer out of his
exile, at  least whenever, in the midst of the privileges of freedom, he manages
not to  forget that silence, and to transmit it in order to make it resound
by means of  his art. None of us is great enough for such a task. But in all
circumstances of  life, in obscurity or temporary fame, cast in the irons of
tyranny or for a time  free to express himself, the writer can win the heart of a
living community that  will justify him, on the one condition that he will
accept to the limit of his  abilities the two tasks that constitute the
greatness of his craft: the service  of truth and the service of liberty. Because his
task is to unite the greatest  possible number of people, his art must not
compromise with lies and servitude  which, wherever they rule, breed solitude.
Whatever our personal weaknesses may  be, the nobility of our craft will always
be rooted in two commitments,  difficult to maintain: the refusal to lie about
what one knows and the  resistance to oppression.

For more than twenty years of an insane history, hopelessly lost like all
the men of my generation in the convulsions of time, I have been supported by
one thing: by the hidden feeling that to write today was an honour because this
 activity was a commitment - and a commitment not only to write.
Specifically, in  view of my powers and my state of being, it was a commitment to bear,
together  with all those who were living through the same history, the misery
and the hope  we shared. These men, who were born at the beginning of the First
World War, who  were twenty when Hitler came to power and the first
revolutionary trials were  beginning, who were then confronted as a completion of their
education with the  Spanish Civil War, the Second World War, the world of
concentration camps, a  Europe of torture and prisons - these men must today rear
their sons and create  their works in a world threatened by nuclear
destruction. Nobody, I think, can  ask them to be optimists. And I even think that we
should understand -  without ceasing to fight it - the error of those who in an
excess of  despair have asserted their right to dishonour and have rushed into
the nihilism  of the era. But the fact remains that most of us, in my country
and in Europe,  have refused this nihilism and have engaged upon a quest for
legitimacy. They  have had to forge for themselves an art of living in times
of catastrophe in  order to be born a second time and to fight openly against
the instinct of death  at work in our history.

Each generation doubtless feels called upon to reform the world. Mine knows
that it will not reform it, but its task is perhaps even greater. It consists
in  preventing the world from destroying itself. Heir to a corrupt history, in
which  are mingled fallen revolutions, technology gone mad, dead gods, and
worn-out  ideologies, where mediocre powers can destroy all yet no longer know
how to  convince, where intelligence has debased itself to become the servant
of hatred  and oppression, this generation starting from its own negations has
had to  re-establish, both within and without, a little of that which
constitutes the  dignity of life and death. In a world threatened by disintegration,
in which our  grand inquisitors run the risk of establishing forever the
kingdom of death, it  knows that it should, in an insane race against the clock,
restore among the  nations a peace that is not servitude, reconcile anew labour
and culture, and  remake with all men the Ark of the Covenant. It is not
certain that this  generation will ever be able to accomplish this immense task, but
already it is  rising everywhere in the world to the double challenge of
truth and liberty and,  if necessary, knows how to die for it without hate.
Wherever it is found, it  deserves to be saluted and encouraged, particularly where
it is sacrificing  itself. In any event, certain of your complete approval, it
is to this  generation that I should like to pass on the honour that you have
just given  me.

At the same time, after having outlined the nobility of the writer's craft,
I should have put him in his proper place. He has no other claims but those
which he shares with his comrades in arms: vulnerable but obstinate, unjust but
 impassioned for justice, doing his work without shame or pride in view of
everybody, not ceasing to be divided between sorrow and beauty, and devoted
finally to drawing from his double existence the creations that he obstinately
tries to erect in the destructive movement of history. Who after all this can
expect from him complete solutions and high morals? Truth is mysterious,
elusive, always to be conquered. Liberty is dangerous, as hard to live with as
it is elating. We must march toward these two goals, painfully but resolutely,
certain in advance of our failings on so long a road. What writer would from
now  on in good conscience dare set himself up as a preacher of virtue? For
myself, I  must state once more that I am not of this kind. I have never been
able to  renounce the light, the pleasure of being, and the freedom in which I
grew up.  But although this nostalgia explains many of my errors and my faults,
it has  doubtless helped me toward a better understanding of my craft. It is
helping me  still to support unquestioningly all those silent men who sustain
the life made  for them in the world only through memory of the return of
brief and free  happiness.

Thus reduced to what I really am, to my limits and debts as well as to my
difficult creed, I feel freer, in concluding, to comment upon the extent and the
 generosity of the honour you have just bestowed upon me, freer also to tell
you  that I would receive it as an homage rendered to all those who, sharing
in the  same fight, have not received any privilege, but have on the contrary
known  misery and persecution. It remains for me to thank you from the bottom
of my  heart and to make before you publicly, as a personal sign of my
gratitude, the  same and ancient promise of faithfulness which every true artist
repeats to  himself in silence every day.

Folks,

does anyone have a table of contents for the tape called "The
Voice of the Poet: Sylvia Plath"?  I'm converting it to CD
(can you believe that they produced this audiobook without a
CD option just five years ago?!)  I can't find the booklet
and it's nowhere online.  If you have it, could you let me
know the contents?  Gratitude in advance,

so, are you granting that these 'avant-garde poetics' have
successfully accomplished this 'purely operational language'?  or is
this more your worry about a current (with)in these poetics?  the idea
of purity has always striked me as muddled.

MSA 7 - Chicago, IL, November 3-6, 2005:

UPDATE: The Conference Website is now live at www.luc.edu/msachicago.
It can also be accessed from the Modernist Studies Association Website
(http://msa.press.jhu.edu/).

CALL FOR SEMINAR, PANEL, and ROUNDTABLE PROPOSALS=20

Deadline for Submission of Seminar Topics: February 28, 2005=20

Deadline for Submission of Panel Proposals: May 9, 2005

Deadline for Submission of Roundtable Proposals: May 9, 2005

Please note:=20

* All who attend the MSA conference must be members of the organization
with dues paid for 2005-6. (MSA membership runs from October to
September.)

* Because we wish to involve as many people as possible as active
participants, MSA does not permit multiple appearances on the program.
That is, one cannot give papers in two sessions, or be both a seminar
leader and a panelist or roundtable participant. However, panelists,
roundtable participants, and plenary speakers who also wish to
participate in a seminar or a "What Are You Reading?" session may
certainly do so. And of course one may chair a session and also appear
elsewhere on the program.

* MSA rules do not allow panel or roundtable organizers to chair their
own session if they are also speaking in the session. Organizers are
encouraged to identify a moderator and include this information with
their proposals; the MSA Program Committee is also able to help you
secure another conference attendee's service as moderator.=20

After the following calls for seminar leaders, panels, and roundtables,
please see at the end of this message announcements for additional
conference events.
  =20

1. CALL FOR SEMINAR PROPOSALS

Deadline: Monday, February 28, 2005=20

Seminars are one the most significant features of the MSA conference.
Seminars are two hours in length. Participants write brief "position
papers" (5-7 pages) that are read and circulated prior to the
conference. With no more than 15 participants, seminars generate lively
exchange and sometimes produce networks of scholars who continue to work
together beyond the conference. The format also allows most conference
attendees to seek financial support from their institutions as they
educate themselves and their colleagues on subjects of mutual interest.


Please note that this is the call for seminar *leaders*. Sign-ups for
seminar participants will take place on a first-come, first-served basis
starting in mid-April.

Seminar Topics

There are no limits on topics, but past experience has shown that the
more clearly defined the topic and the more guidance provided by the
leader, the more productive the discussion. To scan past seminar topics,
go to the "Conference Archives" on the MSA website
(http://msa.press.jhu.edu/archive/archive.html), click the link to a
prior conference, and then click on "Conference Schedule" or "Conference
Program." You'll find seminars listed along with panels and other
events.=20

Proposing a Seminar=20

Seminar proposals must be submitted via email and must include the
following information. Please assist us by sending this information in
exactly the order given here:=20

* Use as a subject line: MSA 7 SEMINAR PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF SEMINAR
LEADER] (e.g., MSA SEMINAR PROPOSAL / GORMAN)

* List the seminar leader's name, institutional affiliation,
discipline, position or title, mailing address, phone, fax, and e-mail
address=20

* Provide a brief curriculum vitae (including teaching experience) for
the seminar leader=20

* Give a brief description (up to 100 words) of the proposed topic=20

Submit proposals by February 28 to:=20

Ann Mattis, Conference Assistant
MSACHICAGO@LUC.EDU=20

Seminars will be selected in mid-March 2005.
 =20

Leading a Seminar=20

Seminar topics will be listed on the conference website in late March
with instructions on how to enroll. Effective seminars have followed a
variety of models, and seminar leaders will be given a menu of best
practices derived from the experience of previous leaders.

E-mail addresses for all seminar registrants will be provided to
seminar leaders in May. At that time, leaders should:=20

* Initiate communications by e-mail, introducing themselves and
providing addresses to all participants=20

* Set guidelines for the seminar, which might include questions to be
addressed, reading to be done, and a specified length for the position
papers (normally 5-7 double-spaced pages). MSA will provide guidance,
but so long as the focus remains on the papers submitted by
participants, leaders are free to use the two-hour time period as they
see fit).

* Set firm deadlines, no later than September 12, 2005 for the actual
exchange of papers=20

* Exchange and read papers during the 7-8 weeks before the conference=20

 =20
2. CALL FOR PANEL PROPOSALS=20

Deadline: Monday, May 9, 2005=20

There are no limits on topics, but please bear in mind these
guidelines:

* We encourage interdisciplinary panels and discourage panels on single
authors.=20

* In order to encourage discussion, we prefer panels with three
participants, though panels of four will be considered.

* Panels composed entirely of participants from a single department at
a single institution are not likely to be accepted.=20

* Graduate students are welcome as panelists. However, panels composed
entirely of graduate students are less likely to be accepted than panels
that include degreed presenters together with graduate students.


Proposals for panels must be submitted via email and must include the
following information. Please assist us by sending this information in
exactly the order given here:=20

* Use as a subject line: MSA 7 PANEL PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF PANEL
ORGANIZER] (e.g., MSA 7 PANEL PROPOSAL / GORMAN)

* Session title=20

* Session organizer's name, institutional affiliation, discipline,
position or title, mailing address, phone, fax, and e-mail address=20

* Chair's name, institutional affiliation, discipline, position or
title, and contact information (if you do not identify a chair, we will
locate one for you)=20

* Panelists' names, paper titles, institutional affiliations,
disciplines, positions or titles, and contact information=20

* A maximum 500-word abstract of the panel as a whole=20

* Brief (2-3 sentence) scholarly biography of each panelist

3. CALL FOR ROUNDTABLE PROPOSALS

Deadline: Monday, May 9, 2005=20

Unlike panels, which generally feature a sequence of 15-20 minutes
talks followed by discussion, roundtables gather a group of participants
around a shared concern in order to generate discussion among the
roundtable participants and with the audience. To this end, instead of
delivering full-length papers, participants typically deliver short
position statements in response to questions distributed in advance by
the organizer, or they take turns responding to prompts from the
moderator. The bulk of the session should be devoted to discussion. No
paper titles are listed in the program, only the names of participants.

Other MSA roundtable policies:=20

* Roundtables may feature as many as 6 speakers

* We particularly welcome roundtables featuring participants from
multiple disciplines, and we discourage roundtables on single authors.

* Panels composed entirely of participants from a single department at
a single institution are not likely to be accepted.=20

* Graduate students are welcome as speakers. However, roundtables
composed entirely of graduate students are less likely to be accepted
than roundtables that include degreed presenters together with graduate
students.


Proposals for panels must be submitted via email and must include the
following information. Please assist us by sending this information in
exactly the order given here: =20

* Use as a subject line: MSA 7 ROUNDTABLE PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF
ROUNDTABLE ORGANIZER] (e.g., MSA 7 ROUNDTABLE PROPOSAL / GORMAN)

* Session title=20

* Session organizer's name, institutional affiliation, discipline,
position or title, mailing address, phone, fax, and e-mail address=20

* Moderator's name, institutional affiliation, discipline, position or
title, and contact information (if you do not identify a moderator, we
will locate one for you)=20

* Speakers' names, institutional affiliations, disciplines, positions
or titles, mailing addresses, phones, faxes, and e-mail addresses

* A maximum 500-word rationale for the roundtable=20

* Brief (2-3 sentence) scholarly biography of each speaker

Send proposals by May 9 to:

Ann Mattis, Conference Assistant
MSACHICAGO@LUC.EDU=20

Roundtables and Panels will be selected in mid-June.


ADDITIONAL CONFERENCE EVENTS: "WHAT ARE YOU READING?"

Last year in Vancouver, the MSA introduced a new kind of session, "What
Are You Reading?" Designed to take advantage, in a productive new way,
of the presence in one place of modernist scholars from many locations,
institutions, and fields, each ninety-minute forum consisted of 8 to 10
participants and a moderator. Led by the moderator, each participant
reported for a few minutes on a scholarly or critical book in modernist
studies, sketching the work's content and explaining why she or he found
it exciting to share with other scholars. Time permitting, moderators
then led discussions  in which participants could seek clarifications,
draw connections, and propose further related reading.

A major goal of "What Are You Reading?" is to facilitate the sharing of
exciting new scholarship (or the "rediscovery" of older scholarship) and
to foster interdisciplinarity by exposing participants to work in
modernist fields other than their own. Open only to those who register
for them in advance, these sessions were widely considered a success and
will be repeated in Chicago.

"What Are You Reading" is not intended as a venue for discussion of
primary texts or works, for self-promotion, or for the enacting of
intellectual conflicts. Participants will therefore be asked not to
present on primary texts or works (though new editions and catalogues
are welcome), their own publications, or scholarship they did not
substantially admire.

To participate, all you will need to do is check the appropriate box on
your MSA registration form and name a book you might be interested in
presenting. MSA registration will begin mid-April; look for
announcements at that time. Please note that you will have to register
by 5 September to be included in "What Are You Reading?"

You will be notified of the time and location of your forum in early
October. There is no need to submit any proposal or paper in connection
with this event, nor do you need to contact your moderator in advance.
Simply check the box, receive notice of your time and location, and show
up ready to share a book! Given the uncertain supply of moderators,
places are limited and will be distributed on a first-come, first-served
basis.

theme of the anthology will be "Writing From the Edges" and submissions
should reflect life on the outer edges of Los Angeles. By writing about
life on the edges of the city, we hope to come closer to a clearer sense
of the city itself.

from the Terry Eagleton's diary at the New Statesman

http://www.newstatesman.com/200501310003

It seems that I've been dropped as a book reviewer by the Irish Times for
daring to criticise Seamus Heaney. He lent his bardic seal of approval to
an unctuously self-congratulatory ceremony in Dublin some months ago, at
which a handful of new members were triumphally admitted to the EU on
second-class terms. The Phoenix Park was full of beaming, backslapping
Irish political boyos; and army officers shouted orders in Irish, just to
prove that the nation cherishes its unique identity at the very moment
when it's busting a gut to look exactly like Switzerland. Meanwhile, the
Gardai were beating up protesters outside. Irish writers haven't on the
whole marched or spoken out on Iraq (they come to London for posh dinners,
not demos), but they'll declaim poems celebrating a club that cripples the
world's poor with its tariffs, because that's not political, you see.

So I wrote a poem for the Irish Times's literary pages satirising this
grisly event, which they published, I suspect, only because they hadn't a
clue what it was about. Once the penny dropped, all review copies and
telephone calls ceased instantly. This is a splendid thing. In the old
Ireland, you were censored for criticising the Virgin Mary. Now it's
Seamus Heaney. That's progress.

CALL FOR 101 POETRY BOOKS

Dear Poet and/or Poetry Publisher,

I am starting a new conceptual art project that addresses the notions of
commercialism and ephemerality in/for poetry.  For this project -- whose working
title is "Commercial Poetry" -- I need donations of unsold poetry books.
Specifically, 101 books each of any single title.  Ideally, those titles should be
of books that you feel have been/will be difficult to sell.

If you think you can participate (and have questions), please feel free to
contact me at

Ertabios@aol.com

Thanks for your time,
Eileen Tabios

P.S. Below are some links about my previous and ongoing works which may be
relevant to this project:

I have a book about literary criticism by Eagleton which is very good -in
fact I must re read it as I learnt a lot from it - overall I find Heaney -
while being a good poet in a kind of  lumpy rustic and "bardic" way - and
very talented - too traditional - a bit obvious and repetitive like Hughes -
I can imagine that scenariao - of course its only via Eagleton - and the
literary world is full of internal politics...(personal struggles are art of
politcs albeit it is perhaps only one side of things) at said I suspect
there is a lot of truth reflected there we are glimsping...

Poets become "names" and/ or get Nobel Prizes and it goes to their heads
and -in Ireland I would say almost national heroes (if they win a Nobel or
whatever) (and write about half decayed swamp men) - the Irish are  always
desparate to claim people - I see Yeats and all sorts of Irish  writers
proudly on the walls of Irish pubs (and that tedious Irish music that they
always play (its nearly as bad as jazz being played instead of Bach) - so
repetitive - almost a cliche) that most people visiting the Irish pubs
probably dont even know - or haven't read - even Joyce bedecks the walls
(who reads Joyce in Ireland ??) (anywhere? - he's too hard) of these
patriotic pubs - partriotism is all very good (say for example -  the
British being patriotic when there was danger they were to be or might be
invaded  in WW2 etc) but at its worst it can descend into madness as in the
Bush admin and various fanatics in the world - in hot spots (Ireland to the
Middle East -where its hard to tell who is who) - the main thing for a lot
of the Bards would be "recognition" - forget about civilains being killed in
Iraq or Israel or wherever...I have
_my _Nobel rize - Pinter spoke out againt the fascist invasions of
Afghanistan and Iraq. He is British Jewish. The Irish use the excuse of
having been invaded by Britain to turn a blind eye to anything Britain is
doing or they imitate the British - the Sassenachs - Joyce satirises all
this so well in The Dubliners etc

Though Pinter's unintentionally become a blustery comic figure:
http://www.haroldpinter.org/politics/god_bless_america.shtml
http://plagiarist.com/poetry/?wid=540


He suspected a rat when they(the poems)  were turned down by the Guardian.
His 'poetry' was successfully parodied by Private Eye shortly thereafter. If
only I could turn up the parodies... Not to say the British press would
actually know interesting poetry, even if it were on page three.

natural selection of physiological characteristics is a _relative_ given.  it is indeed a theory, but not an established fact in the way that we can establish the fact of gravity.  you cannot test evolution nor can you repeat the results of the test.  part of the problem with the way science is taught and understood in this culture is clarity about exactly what it _can_ avail you. the scientific method is nearly absolutely silent on why things occur, other than it can say when this occurs, this too shall occur.  it provides no surefooted means to enter into the black box of human motivation or thinking.  thus neo-Darwinian hypotheses about human behavior have as much (or rather less) validity than psychoanalytic ones do.  psychoanalysis begins with case studies and clinical observation, which are not exhaustive but are suggestive; while neo-Darwinian speculation on contemporary behavior begins either with animal research or with evidence from the fossil record; thus, it eithe
 r uses
 subjects which are even less representative than the post-adolescents of university psychological research or with behavior that was never observed by any living person.

there is a futher irony to consider when dismissing Freudian and psychoanalytic explanations of behavior.  Darwin himself began using the premises of the jejune social science of Malthus, itself merely an excuse to stigmatize English jacobin thinking--the first edition is almost half an attempted refutation of Malthus' mentor, William Godwin--and the poor in general, who naturally are the bearers of vice and disease, not to mention uncontrollable appetites.  it is one thing to document physiological change in animals and its relation to adaption to environment.  it is altogether another thing to explain, for instance, primogeniture by some genetic inevitability in men.  finally, modern social psychology, which at least takes contemporary folks as its subjects is handicapped by its focus on rather limited and narrow questions, as well as its almost comic reliance on college students as a research group.  myself, i prefer the rather old-fashioned literary and intutive approach
 represented by psychoanalysis, which is not so different in form from that which we have traditionally used to understand social behaviors:  the novel.

Brown, by the way, is merely a rather reductive and typically American (in the sense that ego psychology is a typically American rendering of Freud) rendering of a much more profound thinker, Georges Bataille.  in his way, Bataille's thinking on energy's role in life is a much deeper and broader meditation on something that bears some resemblance to Freud's death instinct.  Freud has not been forgotten, but rather his thinking has been absorbed and transformed.

argument about any aspect of human behavior on a Freudian construct, but
one cannot do so as if that construct was a scientific given, as evolution
by natural selection is.

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

THE WANDERING HERMIT REVIEW, a new, twice-yearly independent arts and
literary journal, is looking for poetry and fiction, essays and reviews,
comics and art. The Hermit will be a perfect bound, digest size journal of
120 - 150 pages.

Poetry: Please send 3 - 5 poems at a time preferably pasted into the body of
the e-mail. As Robert Duncan wrote, “every order of poetry finds itself,
defines itself, in conflict with others.” We’d love to see that conflict
take place within the covers of The Hermit. Send acrostics, alcaics,
alphabet poems, aubades, ballads, blues poems, catalog poems, centos,
cinquains, concrete poems, constraint-driven forms of your own invention,
elegiacs, haiku, laments, lang po or oulipo inspired experiments, limericks,
madrigals, odes, pantoums, projective verse, prose poems, rispettos,
rondeaus, roundelays, sapphics, skeltonics, sestinas, sonnets, tanka,
triolets, villanelles.... you get the idea.

Fiction: For short shorties we’d prefer to see the text pasted into the body
of the e-mail. Unlikely to publish anything beyond 20 pages. As with poetry,
we’re open to a broad range of literary fiction. We’d like to see short
stories, microfiction, fables, and novel excerpts that stand on their own.
We’re interested in  Social Realism, Surrealism, Magical Realism, Postmodern
Meta-fiction, and the indefinable. Weird is good. So is funny. Send humor.
Not interested in paint-by-numbers genre fiction but if; like Oakley Hall
for the Western, Walter Mosley for Detective Fiction, Ursula LeGuin for
Sci-Fi, you’re working within the constraints of the genre to say something
serious and original about the human condition, by all means let us have a
look.

Essays & Reviews: Well-written, concise considerations of contemporary arts,
literature and life with a preference for subjects outside the corporate
mainstream and within the Pacific Northwest. DIY culture. Tell us about that
brilliant musician we’re unlikely ever to see perform on television or hear
on the radio, the small press book of the poet too weird and honest for
academia, your neighbor who welds junk into phantasmagoric monsters in his
garage.

Comics & Art: Quality black & white drawings, photos & thoughtful, original
comics.

Please send submissions with a brief bio to: whrev@yahoo.com

Dammit, we've been through this already. Just because we might sympathise
with Pinter's opinions doesn't make his 'poetry' poetry.

Headline:  Koranic duels ease terror
Byline:  James Brandon Contributor to The Christian Science Monitor
Date: 02/04/2005

(SANAA, YEMEN)When Judge Hamoud al-Hitar announced that he and four
other Islamic
scholars would challenge Yemen's Al Qaeda prisoners to a theological
contest, Western antiterrorism experts warned that this high-stakes
gamble would end in disaster.

Nervous as he faced five captured, yet defiant, Al Qaeda members in a
Sanaa prison, Judge Hitar was inclined to agree. But banishing his
doubts, the youthful cleric threw down the gauntlet, in the hope of
bringing peace to his troubled homeland.

"If you can convince us that your ideas are justified by the Koran,
then we will join you in your struggle," Hitar told the militants. "But
if we succeed in convincing you of our ideas, then you must agree to
renounce violence."

The prisoners eagerly agreed.

Now, two years later, not only have those prisoners been released, but
a relative peace reigns in Yemen. And the same Western experts who
doubted this experiment are courting Hitar, eager to hear how his
"theological dialogues" with captured Islamic militants have helped
pacify this wild and mountainous country, previously seen by the US as
a failed state, like Iraq and Afghanistan.

"Since December 2002, when the first round of the dialogues ended,
there have been no terrorist attacks here, even though many people
thought that Yemen would become terror's capital," says Hitar, eyes
glinting shrewdly from beneath his emerald-green turban. "Three hundred
and sixty-four young men have been released after going through the
dialogues and none of these have left Yemen to fight anywhere else."

"Yemen's strategy has been unconventional certainly, but it has
achieved results that we could never have hoped for," says one European
diplomat, who did not want to be named. "Yemen has gone from being a
potential enemy to becoming an indispensable ally in the war on terror."

To be sure, the prisoner-release program is not solely responsible for
the absence of attacks in Yemen. The government has undertaken a range
of measures to combat terrorism from closing down extreme madrassahs,
the Islamic schools sometimes accused of breeding hate, to deporting
foreign militants.

Eager to spread the news of his success, Hitar welcomes foreigners into
his home, fussing over them and pouring endless cups of tea. But beyond
the otherwise nondescript house, a sense of menace lurks. Two military
jeeps are parked outside, and soldiers peer through the gathering dark
at passing cars. The evening wind sweeps through the unpaved streets,
lifting clouds of dust and whipping up men's jackets to expose belts
hung with daggers, pistols, and mobile telephones.

Seated amid stacks of Korans and religious texts, Hitar explains that
his system is simple. He invites militants to use the Koran to justify
attacks on innocent civilians and when they cannot, he shows them
numerous passages commanding Muslims not to attack civilians, to
respect other religions, and fight only in self-defense.

For example, he quotes: "Whoever kills a soul, unless for a soul, or
for corruption done in the land - it is as if he had slain all mankind
entirely. And, whoever saves one, it is as if he had saved mankind
entirely." He uses the passage to bolster his argument against bombing
Western targets in Yemen - attacks he says defy the Koran. And, he
says, the Koran says under no circumstances should women and children
be killed.

If, after weeks of debate, the prisoners renounce violence they are
released and offered vocational training courses and help to find jobs.

Hitar's belief that hardened militants trained by Osama bin Laden in
Afghanistan could change their stripes was initially dismissed by US
diplomats in Sanaa as dangerously naive, but the methods of the
scholarly cleric have little in common with the other methods of
fighting extremism. Instead of lecturing or threatening the
battle-hardened militants, he listens to them.

"An important part of the dialogue is mutual respect," says Hitar.
"Along with acknowledging freedom of expression, intellect and opinion,
you must listen and show interest in what the other party is saying."

Only after winning the militants' trust does Hitar gradually begin to
correct their beliefs. He says that most militants are ordinary people
who have been led astray. Just as they were taught Al Qaeda's
doctrines, he says, so too can they be taught more- moderate ideas. "If
you study terrorism in the world, you will see that it has an
intellectual theory behind it," says Hitar. "And any kind of
intellectual idea can be defeated by intellect."

The program's success surprised even Hitar. For years Yemen was
synonymous with violent Islamic extremism. The ancestral homeland of
Mr. bin Laden, it provided two-thirds of recruits for his Afghan camps,
and was notorious for kidnappings of foreigners and the bombing of the
American warship USS Cole in 2000 that killed 17 sailors. Resisting US
pressure, Yemen declined to meet violence with violence.

"It's only logical to tackle these people through their brains and
heart," says Faris Sanabani, a former adviser to President Abdullah
Saleh and editor-in-chief of the Yemen Observer, a weekly
English-language newspaper. "If you beat these people up they become
more stubborn. If you hit them, they will enjoy the pain and find
something good in it - it is a part of their ideology. Instead, what we
must do is erase what they have been taught and explain to them that
terrorism will only harm Yemenis' jobs and prospects. Once they
understand this they become fighters for freedom and democracy, and
fighters for the true Islam," he says.

Some freed militants were so transformed that they led the army to
hidden weapons caches and offered the Yemeni security services advice
on tackling Islamic militancy. A spectacular success came in 2002 when
Abu Ali al Harithi, Al Qaeda's top commander in Yemen, was assassinated
by a US air-strike following a tip-off from one of Hitar's reformed
militants.

Yet despite the apparent success in Yemen, some US diplomats have
criticized it for apparently letting Islamic militants off the hook
with little guarantee that they won't revert to their old ways once
released from prison.

Yemen, however, argues that holding and punishing all militants would
create only further discontent, pointing out that the actual
perpetrators of attacks have all been prosecuted, with the bombers of
the USS Cole and the French oil tanker, the SS Limburg. All received
death sentences.

"Yemeni goals are long-term political aims whereas the American agenda
focuses on short-term prosecution of military or law enforcement
objectives," wrote Charles Schmitz, a specialist in Yemeni affairs, in
2004 report for the Jamestown Foundation, an influential US think tank.

"These goals are not necessarily contradictory, with each government
recognizing that compromises and accommodations must be made, but their
ambiguities create tense moments."

Some members of the Yemeni government also hanker for a more
iron-fisted approach, and Yemen remains on high alert for further
attacks. Fighter planes regularly swoop low over the ancient mud-brick
city of Sanaa to send a clear message to any would-be militants.

An additional cause of friction with the US is that while Yemen
successfully discourages attacks within its borders on the grounds that
tourism and trade will suffer, it has done little to tackle
anti-Western sentiment or the corruption, poverty, and lack of
opportunity that fuels Islamic militancy.

"Yemen still faces serious challenges, but despite the odd hiccup, we
sometimes have to admit that Yemenis know Yemen best," says the
European diplomat. "And if their system works, who are we to complain?"

As the relative success of Yemen's unusual approach becomes apparent,
Hitar has been invited to speak to antiterrorism specialists at
London's New Scotland Yard, as well as to French and German police,
hoping to defuse growing militancy among Muslim immigrants.

US diplomats have also approached the cleric to see if his methods can
be applied in Iraq, says Hitar.

"Before the dialogues began, there was only one way to fight terrorism,
and that was through force," he says. "Now there is another way:
dialogue."

I wasn't talking about social or psychological darwinism. Biological
evolution is observable.

The old-fashioned literary and intuitive approach I hope isn't based on a
prioris.

Interim notes: fitting the Jacket

Jacket 26 is filling up nicely: some sixty extant pieces to date, with more
to come, including two long interviews with / about Robert Duncan. The issue
should be complete by late February 2005.

Features: the citric-acid talent of neglected British poet Jacket Beeching;
Robert Duncan; Landis Everson and his Kodachrome memories of Berkeley in the
1950s, tribute to Tom Raworth; and more.

A highlight of Jacket 26: the vocals and Norwegian translation of ‘The Day
Lady Died’ by Jan Erik Vold: text, MP3 and RealAudio tracks of the 1986
reading by Jan Erik Vold of ‘Den dagen Lady døde’, with Red Mitchell’s jazz
accompaniment.

        http://jacketmagazine.com/26/index.html

Jacket 27 under the editorial guidance of Pam Brown is beginning to emerge
from its cocoon, item by item. Due to close late April 2005.

These two issues move towards a cleaner page design using more CSS and less
HTML tables, seen in some pages in Jacket 26 and all pages for Jacket 27 and
future issues.

Notes: I have three overseas trips planned for 2005, so if things fall off
the table occasionally, please bear with us.

Also, I had a computer crash a few months ago and lost a lot of pending
email. If you think I may have mislaid an email of yours please send it
again.

Jacket reads new material in June, July and January: J for Jacket!

best for 2005,

John Tranter, Editor, Jacket magazine

I only  sub to one mag in NZ  (BRIEF ) - not (ony) because I am in it !!
Actually I have every copy since it was started by Alan Loney..and I wasn't
published in it until a year or so ago - but I was looking to sub to one
overseas mag  - if i can afford (postage costs are te problem here in New
Zealand) - I liked Fence (what I loved most were reading what all the
contributors read - I am, a person who if i get abook I want to know
everything possible about the author ( I read -and re-read the blurbs and
keep looking at the author's picture and wondering about them, what they are
doing now, how they died,  how thery are living, if they were/are happy,
etc etc - in fact I find it slows my reading I often get a few pages into a
book and if i dont find reference that sends me to another book - I read up
on the author  - so I have a huge lot of unfinished books - read in
fragments -lol)  - incredible the range of things poeple are interested in -
and some great poetry (in Fence) - but couldn't afford it anymore - I
remember Talisman - recall reading some intereting stuff in that - and there
are so many mags - even with "innovative" sytuff -of course you will
recommend your mag but there is Nick Piombinos one - I would to get some
ideas  - Sulphur was good but maybe not quite  - the journal of post modern
poetics - I think is the one I enjoy when I see it - there  are others -
also there are obviously ones in Britain , Australia, Canada etc
Maybe I will just have to look at them online - something about getting
something in the mail -like getting a present..

[Thinking  of Britain - Lawrence (Pinter is a great playwrite and courageous
in his opinions) - I haven't forgotten you - I still intend to buy at least
one of your books (will google etc)  - I _do_ buy books eg i bought nick
piombinos book from the US and some lit crit things - also poeple remember I
am ASPECT BOOKS on www.abebooks.com  - but only a small fish  - gradually
getting some interesting stock I dont want! Also have a lot of stuff
unprocessed as yet...]

What are the "cutting edge" mags in the US, Canada, Aussie etc - or is only
neccesary to read Alan Sondhiem and Steve etc?  and Ron Siliman's Blog etc?
(jiving)  ??

Dont just push _your mag _ although of course  _your_ mag (whoever you
are) - could well be "just the ticket"

yours interestedly and madly - The Mad Kiwi  - aka

 >>INFO: african hip hop websites
===============================

Hello Brother Kalamu,

I was given your contact information by Delia Cleveland. I am a hip
hop artist from East Africa, Tanzania. I perform my lyrics in Swahili
which is my mother tongue. I am currently residing, studying and
working at NYU and also performing in the US. I have been in the US
for a little over 2years.

I understand that you have a listserve, I would appreciate if you
could help spread the word for me about my music and East African Hip
hop.

One of my main mission in hip hop is to raise the level of awarness in
the US of how much hip hop has progressed in the past 15years. It has
become a part of everyday life in africa. It is more than just getting
the material benefits of its fruits or putting food on the table. It
is a blessing to us because it helps educate our youths and gives our
people a sense of identity.

I have spoken at a number of Universities Jay Jay, Syracus and at the
New York Public Library in Harlem, African Museum in Queens. I beleive
there is a lot we have to share in common with brothers and sisters in
the US. In terms of how hip hop can be used effectively as a medium of
infromation and education.  You will be amazed as to how much hip hop
has evolved in Tanzania and Africa. If it wasn't for Hip Hop in the US
there will not be any hip hop in africa or any where in the world.

Please see my BIo for more details.

Balozi Dola's BIO:

Balozi Dola (Ahmed Dola) is a hip hop artist from Tanzania.  My music
is socially conscious, focusing on the political and social economic
situation of young people and artists in Tanzania.  I have released
two albums, "Balozi Wenu" (Your Ambassador) in 2000 and "Ubalozini"
(The Embassy of hip hop) in 2002.  I recently performed at the
International Hip Hop Film Festival (H20 Awards) in New York. Other
performances include the Festival Mundial in Holland and Belgium in
2001, the Zanzibar International Film Festival in 2000, venues all
across Tanzania, several clubs in New York City (Five Spots, Knitting
Factory, Bowery Poetry club, African Museum at Queens, Bronx Museum)
and the Club, Capital in Washington D.C, Boston, Maryland. I have two
video clips to my credit for his hit singles, Kwenye Chati (which went
to the top of the chart in Tanzania) and Nani na Nani (which was
number 2).  A song that he performed with another Tanzanian rap
artist, Mr. II, went to the top of the chart in Holland (Q 97 FM).  In
addition, Balozi Dola worked with a group of eight teenagers in
Tanzania to do a song discussing issues of impoverishment in Tanzania
for the Tanzania Participatory Poverty Eradication Project.  I
formerly performed with a group, The Deplowmatz, who released an album
self titled in 1997 and were awarded the best rap group in Tanzania in
1999.

Thanks,

Balozi Dola

Hey.

I've got a hefty manuscript full of cribbed text, facts, flotsam, jetsam, actual quotes in actual quotation marks.  I'd like to cite sources and am undecided on how to do that.

I'd appreciate any help/ideas/suggestions on citing the sources at the back of the book.  Can anyone point me to some good models in other poetry books where someone did something cool and creative?

thanks.  you can back-channel, but since others might benefit from the discussion, maybe you don't want to.  BETSY

Check the way Carole Maso does her citations at the
end of AVA. She does it by page number; the other way
is the way Lyn Hejinian does it at the end of A Border
Comedy which is by chapter. Susan Howe's The Birth
Mark is a book that mixes Howe's signature prose style
with properly cited academic sources so it may be
worth a look just to see how she uses footnotes vs
endnotes etc.

If you want to do something more actually visual with
footnotes (where the footnotes compete with text for
centrality) then I bet there are dozens of other books
to look at.

Good luck.

MIME-Version: 1.0

this may interest,

:::::
A final reminder: You have just one week to get in your proposal for
workshops and presentations at this year's Montreal Anarchist Bookfair
(May 21) as well as the full day of Anarchist Workshops and Presentations
(May 22). We have an early deadline this year so that we can properly
promote the actual content of the bookfair. Anarchists!: Get organized and
send us your proposals! More info below.
:::::


--> CALLOUT for workshops and presentations at Montreal's Anarchist
Bookfair (May 21, 2005) and Day of Workshops (May 22, 2005) <--

** Deadline for proposals is February 15, 2005! **

The Montreal Anarchist Bookfair collective is currently planning the next
Anarchist Bookfair (our sixth in a row!). This year's bookfair will take
place on Saturday, May 21, 2005, to be followed on Sunday, May 22, 2005 by
a full day of anarchist-themed presentations, panels, debates and
workshops. We will return to the same venue as last year: The CEDA Adult
Education Center at 2515 Delisle (near Lionel Groulx metro) in the Little
Burgundy neighborhood, just west of downtown Montreal.

Last year, the bookfair collective received more than forty workshop
proposals, of which we could only accept twenty-one (due to space
limitations). We invite you to send your proposals again this year,
keeping in mind the following guidelines:

* Proposals for the Day of Workshops (Sunday) should address an
anarchist-themed topic in some depth, and should be intended for people
who are already familiar with anarchism, or might identify as anarchists.
The collective will accept between 10 to 15 workshops.

* Workshop proposals for the bookfair day (Saturday) should be
introductory workshops to anarchism, or an aspect of anarchism, and should
be aimed at people who are curious about, or new to, anarchist ideas.
These workshops should be accessible to non-anarchists. The collective
will accept 6 introductory workshops.

* Workshops can be proposed to take place in French, English or another
language, but the bookfair collective will ensure that at least half of
all workshops are in French-only. The bookfair collective will organize
whisper translation into English and French for all workshops.

* The bookfair collective will strive to have at least one-half of all
workshops presented by people who identify as women.

* The bookfair collective especially encourages workshop proposals by
individuals who identify as women, indigenous, people of colour, working
class, poor, people with disabilities, trans and/or queer.

* Please consult the bookfair principles, which guide the organizing of
the bookfair as an event, including workshop selection. The principles are
available at: http://anarchistbookfair.taktic.org/principles.html

* We have also included below the workshops that have been accepted in the
previous three years. We indicate these topics to provide individuals
proposing workshops with an idea of the kinds of workshops that have been
accepted in the past (and might be accepted again) and to indicate the
workshop topics that have yet to be proposed for consideration by the
collective.


--> IF YOU ARE MAKING A WORKSHOP PROPOSAL, please do the following:

* Submit your proposal in writing, either in French or English, by e-mail
or by post (contact information below). The strict deadline for proposals
is February 15, 2005.

* Provide a title for your workshop. Please choose a title that is
self-explanatory.

* Please provide a short (one to two paragraphs) description of your
workshop.

* Please provide a one-line description of the individual or group
presenting the workshop. If you are proposing a panel, please provide a
one-line biography for each participant.

* Please provide a longer description -- as long as you need -- to
describe your proposal. This longer description will be read by the
bookfair collective to help us decide which proposals to accept.

* Please indicate any audio-visual or space needs in your proposal.

* Please indicate if your attendance is contingent on funding. Our funding
is very limited, but in the past, on rare occasions, we have considered
funding out-of-town speakers, in certain cases.

* Please provide a contact e-mail AND phone number.


Keep in mind that your title, short workshop description and one-line
biography will be used for publicity purposes if your workshop is chosen,
so please provide clear and explanatory descriptions. Keep in mind too
that workshops can be no longer than 1 hour and 50 minutes.

The DEADLINE for all workshop proposals is: February 15, 2005 (no
exceptions).


--> Proposals should be sent by e-mail to: anarchistbookfair@taktic.org.

--> Alternatively, proposals can be mailed to: Montreal Anarchist Bookfair
2033, St-Laurent Boulevard Montreal, Quebec H2X 2T3 CANADUH (mailed
proposals must be post-marked by February 15, 2005 or before).

Mark,

Such reasoning, of course, is based on presumptions, but a presumption is not an a priori.  An a priori is a foundationational premise, such as the belief in the scientific method or the assumption of Aristotelian logic.  This is not the same thing as holding the presumption that men and women do not differ discernibly in either ability or mode of intelligence.  The latter is a starting point, while an a priori is the end of a discussion.  It seems certain bio-behavioral scientists (I myself would not call these researchers "psychologists") begin with the a priori assumption that men and women differ essentially in terms of mode and ability of intelligence.

Freud wrote his work on interpeting dreams with the presumption that they spoke intelligibly about psychic conditions, conditions which he catalogued based upon physical manifestations (hysteria, tics, obsessive compulsive behaviors).  The science of his time said simply that were just in the subject's mind and its positivism wrote them off as mere phantasy.  The new positivism wants to write them off as mere problems with a subject's synapses or adrenal glands, the better to be cured with medications.  It won't accede to fine discrimination that Freud made between neuroses with external causes--death of a loved one, difficulty at work--and neuroses with internal causes (thru the subject's fantasy).  It cannot even consider that the subject's fantasy is itself an embodiment, even though it is patently evident that we are neither mind nor body but some muddled mixture.  Such mixtures cannot be measured and therefore must not exist.  Our century remains positivist, however dead
  the
 verificationist principle is and the question for a language which is absolutely logical.

Thus, it is more than necessary to remember thinkers such as Freud, and before him Nietzsche and Hegel (not Marx, who unfortunately himself is some sort of postivist), and more particularly to remember that we have always come to know things through mixed and messy ways, not simply the Ready and Easy Way of puritanism and science.

I suggest you do some reading in the history of the field and also in
cognitive psychology. You might want to throw in some systems theory while
you're at it. The picture you paint is almost caricature.

There may be folks doing psychological reasearch who begin with "the
assumption that men and women differ essentially in terms of mode and
ability of intelligence," but they hardly represent the field, just as
creationists hardly represent biological theory. There are cranks in every
field, and their assertions are regularly challenged in the journals. A
number of very good studies would seem to indicate that men and women do
differ statistically to a slight degree in certain mental abilities, just
as they do in certain physical abilities. An example from the latter: the
fastest man is likely to be faster than the fastest woman because of the
shape of the pelvis and musculature, but there are a fair number of women
who are faster than all but the very best male athletes. Because we
understand the mechanical reasons for this pretty well we can say with some
degree of certainty that the difference isn't cultural. We only have the
merest beginning of knowledge about the brain mechanisms that might account
for the apparent differences in certain mental abilities, so the jury is
still out on whether, in a society in which women and men were acculturated
educationally in the same manner,  those differences would still hold,
though there are respectable studies that suggest, very tentatively, that
they may.

Bur it's important to remember that at this point the discussion is
primarily statistical and explanations of the findings that are based on
differences in brain structure are of the most hypothetical.

We're talking here about indications that men, statistically, have a slight
edge in math, though there are women who are every bit the equal of the
best minds in the field, and indications that women have a slight language
edge, though there are men who are every bit the equal of the best minds in
the field. In any case, the differences, whatever they turn out to be, are
miniscule compared to the cultural determinants, and there's more than
enough work to be done there for the foreseeable future.

Let's try this out: suppose that we learn that the difference is not in
potential ability so much as in receptivity to certain ways of teaching.
Maybe men simply need to be taught language differently, for instance. That
would be a nice thing to know, and it requires the kind of research that's
being conducted. Not to speak of the greater understanding the studies will
afford of serious health problems. One would think that a good differential
map of the brain would aid the surgeon in knowing where to put the knife
when necessary.

The Oedipus Complex once established became an a priori, by the way. The
scientific method is a guide to procedure.

ERATIO SMEARED


This "review" just up at Web Del Sol, by Tim McGrath:


"Eratio Postmodern Poetry =A0 ://=A0 View | Rating:
Eratio offers up incomprehensible postmodern fodder for critics of=20
postmodern incomprehensibility. Good luck finding anything=20
intentionally; look for links and find a blog, look for poetry and find=20=

quotations. And when you realize that Eratio's editor, Gregory Vincent=20=

St. Thomasino (whose name suggests either a pseudonymously guarded=20
narcissist or the tragi-comic hero of a Wes Anderson film) has included=20=

his own embarrassing asseverations ("Discourse is like a river" is his=20=

unqualified and deplorably facile, but apparently quotable, simile)=20
along with the words of Nietszche, Plato, and Jung, you'll start=20
wondering whether this postmodern experiment is, in fact, a postmodern=20=

parody. On the same page, alongside the luminous Lord Duke G.V. St.=20
Thomasino, Diane Wakoski is quoted as saying, "I feel that poetry is=20
the completely personal expression of someone about his feelings and=20
reactions to the world. I think it is only interesting in proportion to=20=

how interesting the person who writes it is." By Wakoski's logic, the=20
people who bring you Eratio are not very interesting at all."



Friends, as contributors to eratio postmodern poetry, you should=20
proudly count yourselves among some of the most talented and=20
influential writers and artists on the scene today. As editor of the=20
site, I can honestly say that many of the works submitted for eratio=20
simply do not make the cut (and I'm sorry if I've rejected your work,=20
Mr. McGrath, but there's always the welcome to send again).=A0 I try to=20=

be fair when making these judgments, because I know what it means to=20
put your heart into something (especially something like poetry), and=20
how it feels to be rejected.

Eratio is a labor of love, since it generates no revenue for me (but=20
rather costs me time and energy and money). Each issue requires months=20=

of work, involving coding, design, correspondence, planning, and an=20
immeasurable amount of frustration. Ultimately, it's very gratifying --=20=

but I cannot say it's fun.

Still, I am proud to publish your work and hope that its presence at=20
eratio gives you some exposure and some degree of satisfaction that you=20=

otherwise would not have had, and gives you some encouragement to=20
continue being a poet in an economy that doesn't much care about you.

I do not know Tim McGrath. But if you read him closely you'll see that=20=

this is nothing more than a personal attack on me (based on his dislike=20=

of my name!). I am distressed because none of the poetry or artworks=20
are mentioned, and in fact I do not believe Mr. McGrath even bothered=20
to read or look at any of it. (But can he, indeed, talk about the=20
poetry, or the content of the page, or the logic of the concept, I=20
wonder? Why the subterfuge of fixating on my name? No one of any real=20
insight or wit would do that -- unless he were inclined to burlesque.)

As a poet and a critic, I take great care to explicate my reasons for=20
"liking" or "disliking" something. More importantly, I consider it my=20
responsibility to try to place a work into context, to appreciate what=20=

it is the poet is trying to achieve, and to assess whether this has=20
been accomplished (and sometimes I offer alternatives, but I never=20
ridicule and I am never disrespectful, and I always manage to point out=20=

a poet's successes). There are several reviews in the current issue=20
that I took great care in writing, I hope you'll see them for yourself=20=

now that the issue is up.

Reading Tim McGrath's personal attack (on my name, for Pete's sake!) is=20=

an example of something a poet or a critic should never do. Mr. McGrath=20=

has latched on to my name as something that irritates him a great deal,=20=

and in the process has ignored your work and mine. Why does Mr. McGrath=20=

dislike me personally? Could it be that this is payback? (Or else:=20
What's "pseudonymously guarded" about it? What's "narcissist" about it?=20=

I will, however, accept that being a Roman Catholic name it is somewhat=20=

"tragi-comic.")

Mr. McGrath's tone -- glib, cynical, condescending, and uninformed and=20=

lacking of the requisite vocabulary to comprehend let alone explicate=20
or set a value upon "the postmodern" -- is indicative not only of Web=20
Del Sol but of the "unlettered lad" generally. I do not know why Web=20
Del Sol has adopted this attack mentality toward anything to do with=20
"the postmodern," but for sure it is the creativity of resentment.

Compliments Alan, they are wonderful pictures. Especially #12, a
peaceful perfection, but also #13 in its wilder (still accurate)
being.
Thank you for sharing them,

It is nice to see his intelligence flowing back down the pipes.

I guess blogs are all about plumbing, right?

Let's say Tim usually has good pipes.

Chops? Chops are something else.

& "pipes and chops" would sound weird.

Though folks with good chops by definition - unless they indulge too much -
Often have good pipes.

Mark,

Your snideness here to me is something I can only read as defensiveness.  It makes me want to ask you a question which I think as the prime one that psychoanalysis asks:  What exactly are you afraid of?

I suggest you do some reading in the history of the field and also in
cognitive psychology. You might want to throw in some systems theory while
you're at it. The picture you paint is almost caricature.

There may be folks doing psychological reasearch who begin with "the
assumption that men and women differ essentially in terms of mode and
ability of intelligence," but they hardly represent the field, just as
creationists hardly represent biological theory. There are cranks in every
field, and their assertions are regularly challenged in the journals. A
number of very good studies would seem to indicate that men and women do
differ statistically to a slight degree in certain mental abilities, just
as they do in certain physical abilities. An example from the latter: the
fastest man is likely to be faster than the fastest woman because of the
shape of the pelvis and musculature, but there are a fair number of women
who are faster than all but the very best male athletes. Because we
understand the mechanical reasons for this pretty well we can say with some
degree of certainty that the difference isn't cultural. We only have the
merest beginning of knowledge about the brain mechanisms that might account
for the apparent differences in certain mental abilities, so the jury is
still out on whether, in a society in which women and men were acculturated
educationally in the same manner, those differences would still hold,

We're talking here about indications that men, statistically, have a slight

miniscule compared to the cultural determinants, and there's more than
enough work to be done there for the foreseeable future.

Let's try this out: suppose that we learn that the difference is not in

Maybe men simply need to be taught language differently, for instance. That

The Oedipus Complex once established became an a priori, by the way. The

arguably probable "subliminal" influences that can exist in  written=20

affords us that opportunity, if we use a disciplined and  reasonably=20
instrumentalist approach.
=20
The apparent after the fact clairvoyance of code passages is an exhibition =20
of a controlling formulation of dynamic factors that produces an effect. The=
 =20
predictability factor of the passages is essentially meaningless in science.=
 We=20
 may produce replicative phenomena through instrumental methods but we may=20
not  predict that the result will always be the same. This is because all=20
observable  phenomena are affected by certain and several undefined though=20
reasonably  expected dynamics. Because certain reliable dynamics are essenti=
ally=20
undefined  we may only reasonably predict results, but in certain circumstan=
ces we=20
may  produce reliably replicative results through formulation. It is the=20
production  of results, not the prediction of results, that must be consider=
ed in=20
examining  a specific effect or phenomenal dynamic. If a result or effect is=
=20
produced, its  formula must be ascertainable. If something written thousands=
 of=20
years ago has  now been observed as producing a result it is a reliably=20
productive formula  within our range of comprehension. The difficulty with a=
 formula=20
for this  particular effect is that it is a system-wide formula. Since=20
cognition is  arguably the last recognizable developmental dynamic the unive=
rsal=20
system has  managed to objectivise, any formula producing the particular eff=

In the west we fancy ourselves as free individuals. We may be free within =20
the parameter of human existence, but we are not universally free. We are th=

product of a formula. We are a reasonably reliably produced result. What the=
 =20
result that we are produces back into the
universal system as effect and  dynamic cannot be without signifigance. When=
=20
we produce an effect in the system  it is important to question its=20
developmental potential. Does the effect  encourage or hinder development? I=
n the case=20
of the effect we are discussing: it  is a
formulaic constraint on the original formula; essentially using the same =20
undefined dynamics available in the original formula to control a built-in =20
developmental process of the original formula. It is inflexible and empirici=
st  in=20
its seeking to impart cognitive nature to what are just yet to be defined =20
reasonably reliable dynamics. There are no laws in universal reality just =20
reasonably reliable yet to be defined dynamics ascertained so by their  prod=
uction=20
of replicative results in certain formulations. The idea of God is an =20
intellectual recycle bin: that is a place to put everything we have yet to =20
understand. It's time to restore some of the files we've allowed to be sent=20=
 there. The=20
effect we are discussing is a hindrance to development. The formula  that=20
produces the effect is essentially: laziness and stupidity written down  pro=
duces=20
system-wide error as long as certain reliable yet to be defined  universal=20
dynamics are not reasonably understood.=20
=20
There is a vast difference between understanding and defining. Essentially =20
nothing can be defined. This is because there is no definable beginning or e=
nd =20
to anything, only an experiential or existential middle. We may however =20
understand a reasonably probable
beginning, and reasonably assess apparent  effects in the middle of=20
existence. If written language and human understanding  has produced a syste=
m-wide=20
predictable outcome for each and every individual  instance of human cogniti=
on it=20
is clearly an error and unfortunately a prison as  well. In order to break o=

The scribes  did not predict the future. They produced our present with a=20
parlor trick. That  is not remarkable. The mass hysteria in an age before ma=

communication that  caused the scribes to produce
our present is not remarkable just a product of  unfavorable cosmic events,=20

system-wide error in thinking is not remarkable. What is remarkable is that=20=

we have in this age so easily surrendered our individual potential rather th=

 making a reasonable attempt to understand it. In this age of mass=20
communication  I am personally capable of using the
same linguistic methodology as the  scribes to produce a new system-wide=20

understand existence to a greater degree than the  scribes, and expect the c=

respect  the individual potential of every single instance of human cognitio=

"To begin this discussion I want to use the term "subliminal" but since it
is a somewhat overused and archaic term I want to briefly clarify. I think for
the most part it will be acceptable in this discussion as commonly
understood; I  am just attempting to avoid any contentiousness over terminology from
psychology  majors on this list. For the purpose
of this discussion I propose that  "subliminal" be taken to mean: "cognitive
realization of intellectual proposal  outside of immediate logical
recognition" a kind of sensory and cognitive  sleight of hand. At the outset I must
responsibly remark that other than  physical abuse modern psychology is relatively
divided about the probability of  "subliminal" influences on human reason.

Personally, having a bit more than a passing acquaintance with old school
cryptography and modern computer security, I have been humorously perplexed for
some time about the controversy over equidistant letter sequencing alledged
to  exist in Hebrew language
passages of the bible, the Christian or Jewish  mathematicians wet dream
commonly called "bible code", and I have begun to look  at it as what I think it
really is: a poorly comprehended and conceived  probability problem. In any
case I want to discuss the "subliminal" issue  first.

In ordinary written English we have 52 basic symbols and nine commonly used
punctuation symbols. Basic cryptography involved letter substitution and code
pointers, the more pointers the deeper the code. It has been around since the
 Greek alphabet, and now seems to have been around since the Hebrew alphabet,
 which means probably the Sumerian and Babylonian. I think that this needs to
 become significant to anthropologists and historical linguists. Written
langauge  is essentially codefied thought. Pictographic written languages like
Egyptian,  and to a lesser degree calligraphic written languages like Chinese are
more  likely to be esoteric in direct presentation, that is: one had to know
the  secret to recognize any secret; thus a lower sensory threshold area of
the mind  could only be reached by veiwed
written material through a more meditative  gazing process of visual
absorbtion. Concrete characters such as those in  English and Hebrew could reveal
esoteric messages to those who knew or  discovered a code without the necessity of
knowing any secret other than a  collection of characters, because the
characters are always essentially the same  document to document, no lengthy visual
meditation is normally required, and the  letters already exist at a lower
sensory threshold area, thus arguably allowing  for the possibility of
"subliminal"
influence on a dilettante reader.

In quantum theory rhythm is like a pointer dynamic, simply put: if dynamics
or objects exhibit rhythm it is extremely probable that the result is either
another observable dynamic or another observable object. If the probability of
 the nascense of formulated cognition is
virtually inevitable in quantum  systems, as I and many others think it
arguably is, then the argument over the  probability that equidistant letter
sequencing in concretized alphabet written  languages is capable of causing
cognitive realization of intellectual proposal  outside of immediate logical
recognition is proved as: you bet, it is highly  probable. It is remarkably reminiscent
of fundamental theory in the proposition  of quantum computing environments
relating to the grossly or carefully  misrepresented term, depending on your
point of view or
political  affiliation, "artificial" intelligence.

We really do not know what rhythmic patterns of letters can do rolling
around in a human readers mind, but if we are able to logically decipher the  code
after the fact with simple mathematics, it is probable that the same  capacity
exists in a lower sensory threshold
area or "subliminal" area of the  human mind; therefore it is possible that
one could absorb information nearly  unawares, and outwardly exhibit the effect
of that absorbed information  essentially unaware of its origin. Personally,
I can attest that I have solved  mathematical
problems in my dreams and awoke with a memory of the problem and  the
solution, usually startled awake by finding the solution. Since only a very  small
number of western Christians read authentic Hebrew bibles the whole idea  of
"bible code" seems quaint. The agendized esoteric use of rhythmic letter  and/or
symbol placement in written languages with concretized alphabets is
historically evidenced in many languages. There is every reason to believe that  codes
exist in a multitude of liguistically diverse archaic documents, (i/e the
finger alphabet in "The White Goddess" by Graves) and are probably readily
discernible to one who at least grasps the possible agenda of the writer.

Obviously "bible code" whether real, or fabricated, or both, has an agenda.
"Bible code" is not reasonable evidence of the existence of God. A literate
modern first grader could conceive of the idea and practice of code. "Bible
code" is not reasonable evidence that aliens
from outer space mistaken for  Gods by ancient humans taught humans about
code and physics. There is nothing  alien about language or code, in fact it is
profoundly human. Code existed for  naked Irishmen too. It is more reasonable
to propose that "Bible code" was  probably normally practiced by the Hebrew
scribes of the era, and that it was a  type of esoteric practice commonly
evidenced in other anient languages and  cultures. The real clues to the agenda are:
the nature of the document the code  is said to exist in this case, and the
apparent after the fact clairvoyant  nature of the code messages. The bible
itself is in large part a disjointed  documentation of a specific cultural very
human hysteria that spilled over into  the world at large. Initially,
archaically, an elite group of elders or scribes  may have fanned the flames of the
hysteria and been able to induce a collective  assessment of great enough scale to
produce apparently physical or cosmic  phenomena, or often even laying claim
as well through induced hysteria to  ordinary cosmic or elemental phenomena. In
any case, as writers often cannot  resist bragging a bit, the bible itself,
and Hebrew theology, evidence a  knowledege of the basic implications of
collective assessment. (i/e "God  inhabits the praises of his people" or even the
idea of the "Matronit") The  apparent after the fact clairvoyance of passages of
code is indicative of the  result of collective hysteria and evidence of a
quantum sociological effect in  human cogniton: predicting a future of ongoing
cognitive assessment without  proven evidence, fueled by a relatively large
enough magnitude of collective  hysterical cognitive assessment, will conversely
but inevitably evidence a  system-wide predictable future of similar
hysterical cognitive assessment, until  all causal factors relative to the phenomena
are defined correctly. There is no  doubt that cultural isolation begins in
hysteria, is fueled onward by hysteria,  and acts outwardly in hysteria; an
hysteria seized upon in a lack of fundamental  existential evidence. The point is
this: apparent after
the fact encoded  esoteric evidence of clairvoyance is indicative of a
disasterous error in  collective assessment, not the hand of a God. The same
methodological errors in  collective assessment are entrenched in modern science. "A
little knowledge is a  dangerous thing" because if it is written - it is
replicative. It may take  a hundred monkeys or more to shift a biological pattern,
but the change began  with one. Because of written language it only requires
three humans to make a  collective assessment that is potentially culture-wide
or even world-wide, and  only one of them has to be stupid for that assessment
to be wrong."

A book that investigates the Numerical configuration of the old and new
testaments is called
Theomatics-Don't remember the author. It states that Man couldn't write
these books -because every line where God is mentioned God appears on the
8th syllable.
There was also a book written about Shakespeare--with the same theory.

Subject:      after my death, i have been thinking about this writing
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

after my death, i have been thinking about this writing



you would notice my death as an afterthought, peripheral topos; or rather,
you wouldn't notice it at all. it would emerge, slowly, out of the mud
into consciousness; someone else might say something, might send an obit,
and that would serve as the fulcrum or divisor of event and time. but not
for you, and for me only in the past anterior, as if i might have noticed
what i could not during and after the fact, the passage.

it would change everything, this writing, the speaking and speaker of this
writing, and of other writings that pass through my name, and through the
names of others speaking my name, perhaps borrowing it in an area in which
no return is possible.

the writing, the writing plural, writings, would become remnants, signs of
a life, symptomologies for interpretation, and interpretations which i
could never answer, which would remain in other discursive strata, back
and forth, without my author/ity and for that matter, sourceless,
something that may be a matter of pride for the interpreters, a dissection
table perhaps.

the writing, all this oozing about death, this reiteration, inconceivable
recuperation, would become uncanny, unheimlich, stateless, as if it were
once again replete with the fecundity of speech, a paradox.

in my absence, in the absence of my jarring personality, it would be
recognized for what it is, a continuous meditation by the reader as much
as by the writer, something ongoing, something freed from my personality.

in this freeing the words would speak, as if my magic. they would be heard
and seen for what they are: literature, philosophy, psychology. one might
be heard to say, i knew him when, but that knowledge is of a shell, would
be of a shell, and would be a shell.

recognition would surely come, recognition of speaking and writing as an
afterthought, recognition of a stranger behind one on the street, you can
sense his eyes.

the death would be forgotten in the reading of the writing, for what would
remain would be just that, the reading, nothing more, nothing less, and
the fluidity of a writing now always vulnerable, always on the verge of
disappearance.

but there would remain this sensation, one might sense it as a shuddering,
the interpretation would come later, and would require work.

the shuddering would submerge in everyday life among the living of men and
women still alive. the shuddering would later bring the writing to the
foreground for you and newer readers and readers born after the time in
which i died.

you would know all of this, reading the writing i have written, after the
death, after i am no longer writing, at least writing in the ordinary
sense. you would write what you know.

Richard,

I was forwarding a message because Ed Foster, the editor of Talisman, could=20
not do so due to a temporary problem in his university's e-mailing system.=20
Though I have been an admirer of Talisman and Ed Foster as a poet, as a publ=
isher=20
and as a human being- for years, I am not even in the upcoming issue.

Ciao.

Yeah, "iamb that iamb". Or, possibly, "iamb what iamb and that's all

Link for the curious:  http://webdelsol.com/PortalDelSol/#eratio

Gregory: You're aware, I hope, that the executive poetry editor of the
whole WebDelSol thang is Joan Houlihan, locus of so much controversy
on this list for her attacks (in a different section of that same
site) on Language and avant/post-avant poetries?

So I wouldn't feel too bad about it. A bad review from the league of
the narrow-minded may well be a solid compliment (Eratio taking a
bullet in the poetry culture wars?)  Their review of _Fence_ ("a
change of staff is highly recommended") is similarly ad hominem.

Besides, I see in their review of _Salt Hill_ that they don't know the
difference between "its" and "it's", which tells you something about
the calibre of the reviewer(s).

Subject:      The religious foundation of language
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Firstly, let me apologize for the poor quality of the T. Cruz quoted text =20
which renders it difficult to read. I have yet to master the copy and paste=20=
=20
technique from one format to another. Even after carefully going through all=
 the =20
punctuation and character adjustments, it still appears as garbage with =20
unexpected spaces and line shifts. Secondly, I should have called the subjec=
t: =20
quantum, religious and poetic nature of language.
=20
From what I understand of the proposed theory, written language evolved  upo=
n=20
either an intended or accidental understanding of quantum level rhythm and =20
future probabilities. Furthermore he suggests that written language could ha=
ve =20
developed during an intense religious subversion of human thought, with the=20=
=20
language itself (character and rhythmic placement) being intentionally=20
expressed  as code. This code was permanently implanted in language for a nu=
mber of =20
purposes, but the primary result is that it has lasted so very long.=20
=20
I have always been an advocate of Robert Graves=E2=80=99 language theory sin=
ce it  is=20
poetic. Whether he and Laura Riding developed it together or separately is =20
not as important to me as its import. I agree with Graves, and what I =20
understand of the Cruz theory is that language reflects both our biological=20=
and =20
intellectual proclivity towards symbolism AND rhythm. Also, Cruz was offerin=
g a =20
portion of his theory in a quasi-existentialist discussion group which is =20
interdisciplinary, incorporating literature, phenomenology (scientific and =20
philosophical) and atheism. He said that despite the fact that language may=20=
have  at=20
its foundation a religious agenda does not prove the existence of god. He =20
said that the founders of such a language were aware of a technique which =20
appeared powerful & mystical, a sleight of hand. Rhythm is intrinsic to  eve=
rything=20
so poetry and language would have this ubiquitous component.
=20
Now please, disagree with the theory in a manner that befits and implies =20
intelligence and comprehension of at least one of the disciplines comprising=
 the =20
theory.  Perhaps, poetry? There are many extant language theories, but this=20=
=20
one is unique. Like I said, Graves (a poet, remember?) suggested a simpler =20
version which did not include quantum physics. He was not a great poet, but=20=
he =20
understood language and its intent far better than those who abuse it so =20
regularly.=20

his own embarrassing asseverations ("Discourse is like a river" is his=20=

along with the words of Nietszche, Plato, and Jung, you'll start=20
wondering whether this postmodern experiment is, in fact, a postmodern=20=

Friends, as contributors to eratio postmodern poetry, you should=20

site, I can honestly say that many of the works submitted for eratio=20
simply do not make the cut (and I'm sorry if I've rejected your work,=20
Mr. McGrath, but there's always the welcome to send again).=A0 I try to=20=

put your heart into something (especially something like poetry), and=20
how it feels to be rejected.

Eratio is a labor of love, since it generates no revenue for me (but=20
rather costs me time and energy and money). Each issue requires months=20=

of work, involving coding, design, correspondence, planning, and an=20
immeasurable amount of frustration. Ultimately, it's very gratifying --=20=

but I cannot say it's fun.

Still, I am proud to publish your work and hope that its presence at=20
eratio gives you some exposure and some degree of satisfaction that you=20=

continue being a poet in an economy that doesn't much care about you.

I do not know Tim McGrath. But if you read him closely you'll see that=20=

this is nothing more than a personal attack on me (based on his dislike=20=

of my name!). I am distressed because none of the poetry or artworks=20
are mentioned, and in fact I do not believe Mr. McGrath even bothered=20
to read or look at any of it. (But can he, indeed, talk about the=20
poetry, or the content of the page, or the logic of the concept, I=20
wonder? Why the subterfuge of fixating on my name? No one of any real=20
insight or wit would do that -- unless he were inclined to burlesque.)

As a poet and a critic, I take great care to explicate my reasons for=20

responsibility to try to place a work into context, to appreciate what=20=

been accomplished (and sometimes I offer alternatives, but I never=20

Marcus,

People who still use the word "postmodernists" aren't. Call me on the
carpet. It's better than never having an original thought or philosophizing  about
poetry instead of writing it. And whatever whale dreck is, sperm or shit,  at
least it's organic, waste product, a sign of something that's living.
Cognition and language are the latest and greatest in the evolutionary history  of our
species, but you gotta get a grip to produce even a spoonful.

Just a quick notice of my digital chapbook "Poems of Wax and Waiting" at

The poems are about wax.  (A couple are about waiting.)

They are located online at:

i don't want to get into this debate, but "philosophizing about
poetry" is a form of writing poetry.

Announcing the CSU Biennial Writing Conference, hosted on Saturday, =
April 30th, 2005, on the campus of Central Connecticut State University =
in New Britain, CT. This conference will encompass the faculty and =
students from the four CT state schools (Central, Eastern, Southern, =
Western), as well as poets and prose writers from area institutions =
(Yale, Trinity, University of Hartford, St. Joseph's and University of =
New Haven). This theme of the conference is "Craft and Modalities," =
which we define broadly and apply to the genres of fiction, non-fiction, =
poetry, drama and multimedia writing. Writers interested in =
participating in the conference should email Ravi Shankar at =
<shankarr@ccsu.edu> with any ideas for panels or readings, brief bio, =
and a sample of creative work. The conference will be free and open to =
the public, and a limited amount of stipends will be available to help =
defray the expenses of invited participants. =20

Ah, but we might get a toehold in the problem if we put Subject A in a PET
scanner (http://www.triumf.ca/welcome/petscan.html) and got them to recite
Hiawatha. If you chucked enough money at it, you'd get a 3D cartoon
extravaganza with Bugs Bunnie for free! Admittedly granularity might not
what you want, but I bet it would be a good starter for 10.

In fact, there be quite a few issues which could be dealt with in the same
way. Saves all that voodoo stuff with the math.

"Good luck finding anything
intentionally"?!?

Pray, what could the writer have possibly meant by this sentence?  That the reader has no will before the texts of eratio?  That the writers do everything at random?  Silly new critic! The reviewer seems not to know that intentionality is an affect of language and an affect that even the most random texts still have.  Though I admit not being able to discern intentionality in the above phrase.

I'm afraid eratio must have gone over their heads and so the whines of the entitled begin.

The whole readership of anything has been so inflated. What we call =
literacy now actually is just those things--if you get, say, some =
washing up liquid, it's got a picture of a lemon on it, meaning it's got =
that fragrance. If you know enough that that's not salad dressing =
because of the lemon picture on there, then you're literate. That's ALL =
it means. That's all literacy now means. And if you put that on salad, =
then you're illiterate.

I like craft, but when you only concentrate on craft like that, it's =
hideous: like link sausages.

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT

KEEPING IT SIMPLE/LOOKING FOR THE LIGHT =AD PATRICIA SPEARS JONES
TUESDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 22ND
"The quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives has direct bearing
upon the product which we live...It is within this light that we form those
ideas by which we pursue our magic and make it realized. This is poetry as
illumination." =AD from =B3Poetry is Not a Luxury=B2 by Audre Lorde. =B3This is a
poetry workshop that takes the poetry of illumination to mean the poetry of
experience. How we scrutinize, how we elucidate our lives through words and
rhythms, how we make our poems bring new ways of thinking about our lives.
We will focus on the basics: line, stanza, cadence, meter, diction, syntax,
and point of view -=AD the elements that make a poem. We will also read
contemporary poets including Audre Lorde, Maureen Owen, Amy Gerstler, Shara=
n
Strange, Lee Young Lee, Jeanne Marie Beaumont, Frank O'Hara, Lorenzo Thomas=
,
and Bob Kaufman.=B2 Patricia Spears Jones is an award-winning poet and
playwright, and author of The Weather That Kills. Students must submit 5-10
pg. work samples by FEB. 14.

FINDING THE & THEN SOME THERE THERE =AD MERRY FORTUNE
THURSDAYS at 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 24TH
Film of Dreyer, writing of Mayer, painting of Traylor. An identifiable poet
=B3voice=B2 is a desirable, comfortable and utilitarian achievement. But what
potential or beautiful mystery lurks beyond carefully cultivated form,
tendency, technique, habit and boundary. Exploring the processes, qualities
and aesthetics of all art forms we will collectively discover commonalities=
,
and fearlessly apprehend what we may learn to expand our poetic values and
vocabularies as well as our very minds. Merry Fortune is the author of
Ghosts By Albert Ayler, Ghosts By Albert Ayler (Futurepoem).

HYPNOSIS AND CREATIVITY =AD MAGGIE DUBRIS
FRIDAYS AT 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 25TH
=B3Hypnotic and trance states have been used for centuries by shamans, mystic=
s
and visionaries. In this five week workshop, we will study techniques for
self-hypnosis that allow a writer to easily access the creative flow state.
We will explore the use of hypnotic tools to generate images, to increase
creative focus, to switch gears from a day job into writing, and to
circumvent creative blocks. We will also discuss the use of hypnosis to
vividly recall memories, and its use in conjunction with other creative
tools such as automatic writing.=B2 A $20 materials fee covers four of
Dubris=B9s hypnosis CDs, three of which are specifically geared to writing.
Maggie Dubris is the author of Skels (Soft Skull Press 2004), and Weep Not,
My Wanton (Black Sparrow Press 2002). She is also employed as a professiona=
l
hypnotist.=20


POETRY AND MUSIC =AD DREW GARDNER
FRIDAYS at 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN APRIL 8TH
=B3A workshop investigating the relation of music and poetry, comparing the
languages of poetry and music and asking questions about how they can be
combined and how they might illuminate each other. What are the poetic
implications of improvisation? What are the musical implications of everyda=
y
speech? What does our experience of poetry imply about how we experience
sound and how does our listening affect our writing? We will read and liste=
n
to Harry Partch, Morton Feldman, Leo Smith, Pauline Oliveros, Thoreau,
Nathaniel Mackey and others, keep listening notebooks and collaborate with
guest musicians. No musical background required.=B2 Drew Gardner is the autho=
r
of Sugar Pill (Krupskaya) and conducts the Poetics Orchestra, an ensemble
featuring poetry and structured improvisation.


A LAB: POST-CONCEPTUAL POETRIES =AD ROBERT FITTERMAN
SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 26
=B3What happens when we ask ourselves not if the poem =B3could have been done
better, but whether it could have been done otherwise=B2 (Dworkin). In
post-conceptual writing, the expression is realized in the process. This
workshop will be a hands-on writing lab. Each week we will write poems
in-class generated by borrowed models from contemporary, 21st Century
poetry. Some of these experiments might include: sampling, bastardization,
procedural writing, mixed media, collaboration, etc.=B2 Robert Fitterman is
the author of 9 books of poetry including: Metropolis XXX (Edge Books),
Metropolis 16-29 (Coach House Press) and Metropolis 1-15 (Sun & Moon Press)=

Mary,

I think you can send attachments to this list.  That would be far preferable than the way the text ends up formatted.  When confronted with the odd line breaks, my snap judgment unfortunately turns to abject metaphors.

At the same time (and bear in mind, I have only read the first part), I am not sure what is at stake in Cruz's discussion.  I think it needs some translating or perhaps context, but he seems to be arguing that language is always encrypted, so those who find encryptions are actually not getting the point.  I don't get the point, though.  I think it is rather unlikely that every text has encryptions, some dark secret point to Logos.  And I hold quite strongly to the thesis that men invented the gods (we had, too, after the dwarves and the elves and the wizards left the world, since we realized how lonely we were going to be).  The piece seems like a whole lot of sound and fury which unfortunately signifies not very much (at this point).

A provocative text nevertheless.

best,

Robert

Firstly, let me apologize for the poor quality of the T. Cruz quoted text
which renders it difficult to read. I have yet to master the copy and paste
technique from one format to another. Even after carefully going through all the
punctuation and character adjustments, it still appears as garbage with
unexpected spaces and line shifts. Secondly, I should have called the subject:
quantum, religious and poetic nature of language.

From what I understand of the proposed theory, written language evolved upon
either an intended or accidental understanding of quantum level rhythm and
future probabilities. Furthermore he suggests that written language could have
developed during an intense religious subversion of human thought, with the
language itself (character and rhythmic placement) being intentionally
expressed as code. This code was permanently implanted in language for a number of
purposes, but the primary result is that it has lasted so very long.

I have always been an advocate of Robert Gravesâ€™ language theory since it is
poetic. Whether he and Laura Riding developed it together or separately is
not as important to me as its import. I agree with Graves, and what I
understand of the Cruz theory is that language reflects both our biological and
intellectual proclivity towards symbolism AND rhythm. Also, Cruz was offering a
portion of his theory in a quasi-existentialist discussion group which is
interdisciplinary, incorporating literature, phenomenology (scientific and
philosophical) and atheism. He said that despite the fact that language may have at
its foundation a religious agenda does not prove the existence of god. He
said that the founders of such a language were aware of a technique which
appeared powerful & mystical, a sleight of hand. Rhythm is intrinsic to everything
so poetry and language would have this ubiquitous component.

Now please, disagree with the theory in a manner that befits and implies
intelligence and comprehension of at least one of the disciplines comprising the
theory. Perhaps, poetry? There are many extant language theories, but this
one is unique. Like I said, Graves (a poet, remember?) suggested a simpler
version which did not include quantum physics. He was not a great poet, but he
understood language and its intent far better than those who abuse it so
regularly.

I've just been looking in on all this and I'm both fascinated and bewildered: bewildered by some of the terms that are flying around
and fascinated by the subject. Methinks that the relationship between language and the sacred is ultimately irrefutable, however,
that is not to key into some kind of GDubbya crap rhetoric of good and evil powers. The rhetoric that is, not necessarily the
reality. Me and my little disabled lady, who both probably can be called alcoholics, and have 'enjoyed' personal lives throughout
our adulthood existence that can be mildly termed as chaotic, do both believe in a loving-kindness deity without having any
assurance of post-mortem continuance, which does not mean a subscription to some of the nastier prophets in the Bible. When we go to
our Methodist church we find a symbolic language in the services which makes us, however briefly, fell slightly sane (for a
change!). I think too that that looking for structure, meaning even in the without meaning, is close to the heart of the drive
behind the poetic impulse, creating form from what is formless, maybe, even if life is but a joke. Not so much let us praise famous
men but let us praise something that isn't horrid, as it were. Little Vicky often goes out a 6.30 in the morning with her walking
frame to keep exercising, she also often runs me over with it when she's pissed, with the result that I sometimes have to use a
walking stick because my foot is bruised, but that is the human comedy which is also divine, I love it all, even if absurdity is
what underlies all we believe in, all we feel, even love, or poetry.

All the Best

The light of Reason gone, and feign
To vanquish Language from the sane,
Just so the dredging of the Seine
Resultant cruise beyond the Main,
Beyond the Ghast, where Darkness reign,
The ghost or gast behest and Thane
And Lord shall mourn the pain
Within - Without, the Violent gain,

The Meek are weakened, slaughtered, stained,
Bound, nonetheless by blackness, chained.

And just so, Jonathan and Jane

Alan

Some brilliant writing as usual - that one on genesis etc looks
interesting -but I'll be surprised if someone doesn't complain how long it
is - but I wouldn't take any notice unless the moderator objects - you
should be putting your stuff on -

I also looked at your jpgs etc - varied reactions but I was very interested
and liked the pictures (not all) - there is an ambiguous quality to them (of
course its not really a question of liking per se) - as i say - a disturbing
disturbance they generate in me - but you have put a lot of work into this
project of yours - there are hundreds of pictures  -and some animations -
that music was good - it came at the right time (for me) after some thing -
thing! - had disturbed me in one of your "nature" pictures (think of teh
ichneumon wasp, think of death and sex and decay but think of breathing and
the light and the ectasy, think, adn dont think)- but being "disturbed" is
ok !! That's never a criticism  - irritated - exasperated because sometimes
perhaps envious ,yes - even angry with Alan - yes - sometimes absolutely
amazed - yes - sometimes not interested - but almost always interesting (A's
work is never trite) -

its harder to make effort to connect to peoples' blogs and links I find - so
you are a lot more likely to be seen (and who knows is looking?) if you send
direct - and also that is good for me - you know your posts are the main
things I read on the list - i find a lot else is trivia (although I enjoy
much of the other writers who contribute ) - there is no way I or anyone is
ever going to "see" your whole work but that's ok its fascinating and as you
say it resonates so it can be read anyway - in any order - (although some
people will just "trash it" - but that's the way it always has been
Alan -don't worry about the The Great Deleter of This World ( I think he
deletes everything I send!!) -he has his own world - I don't know what kind
of poetry he writes - actually I just saw one poem the other day of his in
an Aussie mag (issued in about 1970!!)  - years ago so its probably not
representative - ) - that was also B K Johnoson's idea (to read his novel -
loose leaved and in a box) in any order..great minds Alan !

Re film  - I am not greatly into film but I was greatly affected by
Brakhage I saw also NZ's Len Lye's work is strange - he had some rich
strange and interesting ideas - but I can see you being tangential to these
various 'schools ' - hard to place you - which is probably good - is good -
you not only cant be placed you cant be replaced !!

most of what I wrote my "middle period" - and quite a bit was published here
and there - was simply written (and simply re(a)d ! hope not!)- as if I was
composing music - without much conscious thought  so to speak - often no
idea what I was about to write about or why (sometimes kind of responding to
music or art) I was making a kind of music with words I suppose - I couldn't
explain much of it ( i really got a "buzz" only when I could read it aloud
to people: publish by voice and presence was me then... I was popular as a
reader in Auckland - but I stopped becasue i used to drink a lot at the same
time (and get caught by the cops driving ( some strange stories there!! -
nealy killed myself a few times ..i think....) and terrorising women and
have public fights (they wernt very good fights lol) with my ex and or her
lovers etc etc etc etc -madness - madness!!  - all gone - no (hardly any)
feeling for even sex now -hence passion gone -maybe drive gone also -all
gone - gone! gone! gone! - all gone thank god )  so I avoid readings now)
( I dont go to many social events as such ) (and not drinking and walking
and being healthy are great - being alive is enough - (going public now
Alan) - love it - the readings and the adulations  - and even any poetry at
all - can go if need be - into the fire - burn all my writings - enflame I
command you!! enflame !! free me - words !!

- as long as I feel good - but that isnt your case I know - your are
passionate - driven) -

and I was dark but driven in those drink times

and words came

some were words i heard or would hear coming from dreams or as i was falling
asleep etc or the ideas flashed in that "inward eye" - lol!  (lol -it  - the
term -irritates me but I keep using it)

After a while I found I wrote everything too quickly and too easily - then I
thought of doing a project (well before I even got a computer ) but have
really done much on it (to be looking at all these writers around me with
ther various ideas and projects etc and yours in particular ( I may have to
stop looking if I want to get any confidence to write!) (my father told me
the story years ago - Turner is said to have one of his paintings beside
some other artist in an exhibition -and someone pointed out how his sun
blazed so much it put the other work in the shade so to speak - so he
painted his sun out with black paint!) (but dont paint out your sun Alan!) -
i doubt I really had anything original to contribute in my projected
project(s) that had not been said elsewhere  - or whatever) - I m not very
energetic and now I have more or less -almost lost interest in writing - but
I know if i put my mind into the right gear the music will start again..or
it might just come - unbidden as the buds and birds of spring!- it -my
brain/mind is eating up ideas for now (well either that or its just shutting
down!)...

You affect this person in any case Alan...lol (use that cyber shorthand
everyday in chess on the net - especially when I make a stupid blunder!)

Keep going Alan - keep going all of you whether on your blogs or by sending
links or whatever  -keep going all of you - all you writers and creators -
ignore that person who attacked the postmodern magazine (or the
non-postmodern magazine - whatever) with that kind editor St Thomasino -
keep on, keep on  - of whatever style or approach -keep on - keep on -
regardless - i dont know why

Great suggestions, all; glad to have such a wealth of material to choose
from. And I suppose I'm compelled to exhibit a couple of satirical poems of
my own as due recompense-

-RS


Ten Truisms and a Lie

Spatulas make passable flyswatters.
On average, double coupons mean twice as much.
To make a monkey a man, offer a cigarette.
Orange is the new pink; pink was the new black.
Punk rock panders.
Sour cream and onion sells more than salt and vinegar.
Some prefer bromides to platitudes.
The phrase, irony is based on misrelationship discovered
by the ‘I’ between existence and the idea of existence, is plagiarized.
Aristophanes meant well when he put Socrates in a basket.
Even the mullet has risen!



And from Instrumentality-

The Flock’s Reply to the Passionate Shepherd
         After Christopher Marlowe

Marooned upon this grassy knoll,
We wander lost from vale to pole,
Our wooly backs resemble thorn,
It’s been a while since we’ve been shorn.

You waste much time trying to woo
That nymph who never will see you.
Since it’s a shepherd that you are,
You’re better off courting a star.

But over here, your loyal flock
Needs no clasp, no precious rock
To follow you from field to field:
If love’s your need, we can but yield.

Have you not heard us cry and bleat
When you approach us, then retreat?
We miss your orders and your laugh,
We even miss your clouting staff.

Save those gowns made of our wool,
No need to make belts or to pull
Posies from the hillside’s crease—
That nymph is what we call a tease.

Just as the hours wing away,
There are some sheep that love to play:
If such delights your mind might move
Then live with us and be our love.

Hi All,

could you please circulate this to students and friends?  thanks much, lisa jarnot

I will be conducting a 10 week poetry writing workshop at my apartment in Williamsburg Brooklyn, beginning the Week of March 1st.  The fee is $250 and the course is limited to six students.  The workshop is open to beginning thru advanced students of poetry and will address issues of content and form, traditional verse forms vs. "field theory" poetics, the interaction of linguistic theory, phonetics, and poetics, ideas of lineage and derivation in poetry, and other topics that suit the interests of the students.  The times and days of the workshop will be determined by the schedules of the students.   Please contact me at jarnot@earthlink.net or view my website at http://www.angelfire.com/poetry/lisajarnot/ for more information.

Yes Richard, for someone who has "almost lost interest in writing," you
are fluent.  Perhaps your mind is already in the right gear and the
music has started again unbidden as the birds and buds.  Anyway as you
say to Alan: don't paint out your sun Richard.

Alan

Some brilliant writing as usual - that one on genesis etc looks
interesting -but I'll be surprised if someone doesn't complain how long
it
is - but I wouldn't take any notice unless the moderator objects - you
should be putting your stuff on -

I also looked at your jpgs etc - varied reactions but I was very
interested
and liked the pictures (not all) - there is an ambiguous quality to them
(of
course its not really a question of liking per se) - as i say - a
disturbing
disturbance they generate in me - but you have put a lot of work into
this
project of yours - there are hundreds of pictures  -and some animations
-
that music was good - it came at the right time (for me) after some
thing -
thing! - had disturbed me in one of your "nature" pictures (think of teh
ichneumon wasp, think of death and sex and decay but think of breathing
and
the light and the ectasy, think, adn dont think)- but being "disturbed"
is
ok !! That's never a criticism  - irritated - exasperated because
sometimes
perhaps envious ,yes - even angry with Alan - yes - sometimes absolutely
amazed - yes - sometimes not interested - but almost always interesting
(A's
work is never trite) -

its harder to make effort to connect to peoples' blogs and links I find
- so
you are a lot more likely to be seen (and who knows is looking?) if you
send
direct - and also that is good for me - you know your posts are the main
things I read on the list - i find a lot else is trivia (although I
enjoy
much of the other writers who contribute ) - there is no way I or anyone
is
ever going to "see" your whole work but that's ok its fascinating and as
you
say it resonates so it can be read anyway - in any order - (although
some
people will just "trash it" - but that's the way it always has been
Alan -don't worry about the The Great Deleter of This World ( I think he
deletes everything I send!!) -he has his own world - I don't know what
kind
of poetry he writes - actually I just saw one poem the other day of his
in
an Aussie mag (issued in about 1970!!)  - years ago so its probably not
representative - ) - that was also B K Johnoson's idea (to read his
novel -
loose leaved and in a box) in any order..great minds Alan !

Re film  - I am not greatly into film but I was greatly affected by
Brakhage I saw also NZ's Len Lye's work is strange - he had some rich
strange and interesting ideas - but I can see you being tangential to
these
various 'schools ' - hard to place you - which is probably good - is
good -
you not only cant be placed you cant be replaced !!

most of what I wrote my "middle period" - and quite a bit was published
here
and there - was simply written (and simply re(a)d ! hope not!)- as if I
was
composing music - without much conscious thought  so to speak - often no
idea what I was about to write about or why (sometimes kind of
responding to
music or art) I was making a kind of music with words I suppose - I
couldn't
explain much of it ( i really got a "buzz" only when I could read it
aloud
to people: publish by voice and presence was me then... I was popular as
a
reader in Auckland - but I stopped becasue i used to drink a lot at the
same
time (and get caught by the cops driving ( some strange stories there!!
-
nealy killed myself a few times ..i think....) and terrorising women and
have public fights (they wernt very good fights lol) with my ex and or
her
lovers etc etc etc etc -madness - madness!!  - all gone - no (hardly
any)
feeling for even sex now -hence passion gone -maybe drive gone also -all
gone - gone! gone! gone! - all gone thank god )  so I avoid readings
now)
( I dont go to many social events as such ) (and not drinking and
walking
and being healthy are great - being alive is enough - (going public now
Alan) - love it - the readings and the adulations  - and even any poetry
at
all - can go if need be - into the fire - burn all my writings - enflame
I
command you!! enflame !! free me - words !!

- as long as I feel good - but that isnt your case I know - your are
passionate - driven) -

and I was dark but driven in those drink times

and words came

some were words i heard or would hear coming from dreams or as i was
falling
asleep etc or the ideas flashed in that "inward eye" - lol!  (lol -it  -
the
term -irritates me but I keep using it)

After a while I found I wrote everything too quickly and too easily -
then I
thought of doing a project (well before I even got a computer ) but have
really done much on it (to be looking at all these writers around me
with
ther various ideas and projects etc and yours in particular ( I may have
to
stop looking if I want to get any confidence to write!) (my father told
me
the story years ago - Turner is said to have one of his paintings beside
some other artist in an exhibition -and someone pointed out how his sun
blazed so much it put the other work in the shade so to speak - so he
painted his sun out with black paint!) (but dont paint out your sun
Alan!) -
i doubt I really had anything original to contribute in my projected
project(s) that had not been said elsewhere  - or whatever) - I m not
very
energetic and now I have more or less -almost lost interest in writing -
but
I know if i put my mind into the right gear the music will start
again..or
it might just come - unbidden as the buds and birds of spring!- it -my
brain/mind is eating up ideas for now (well either that or its just
shutting
down!)...

You affect this person in any case Alan...lol (use that cyber shorthand
everyday in chess on the net - especially when I make a stupid blunder!)

Keep going Alan - keep going all of you whether on your blogs or by
sending
links or whatever  -keep going all of you - all you writers and creators
-
ignore that person who attacked the postmodern magazine (or the
non-postmodern magazine - whatever) with that kind editor St Thomasino -
keep on, keep on  - of whatever style or approach -keep on - keep on -
regardless - i dont know why

I am confused by technicalities. My e-mail is Microsoft Entourage 2001 for
Mac and I use a G-4 Mac OS 9.2.2. But it seems that I cannot directly send

when I attach an image to my e-mail and send it to myself, the image appear=

My question is, since I don=B9t know how to send an image by e-mail without
attaching it, even if it may appear also in the textual area as well as in
the attachment area, will you accept submissions sent that way?

Dear Friends --

I am thankful to everyone who responded.  I will gladly take a bullet=20
for our poetry, and I will wear my scar proudly.

So far as Snow White and her seven mental dwarfs go, what they cannot=20
accept is this:  More people are writing poetry (and other creative=20
writings) today because of Language and post-avant than for any other=20
reason.  I think the influence is comparable to that of the Beats, and=20=

like that of the Beats, there are succeeding generations.  If you=20
really love creativity, how can this be bad?  You gotta give credit=20
where credit is due!  Snow White and her dwarfs ought to channel their=20=

resentment into writing a better poem, one that appeals to the spirit=20
of the times the way that Language and the post-avant and the=20
postmodern have.  You just gotta give credit where credit is due. . . .

(And I do not believe that people who use the term "postmodern" are not=20=

postmodern -- say, in their poetry and in the way they think.  I do,=20
however, believe that it is a broad category.  And where concerns=20
poetry, it is more than a matter of form or style or technique, it is a=20=

sensibilities.  Agree or disagree -- I have friends who do both -- it's=20=

really not that big a deal for me.  The term does not offend or=20
threaten or challenge me -- or my self-image -- in any way.  And I=20
think it is ridiculous to dismiss a person because of his vocabulary. =20=

Not all of us seek legitimacy by way of association -- I suppose it's a=20=

self-image thing, or maybe it's a career thing.  I suppose it's a=20
"value" thing.)

I'll be reading you all wherever I find you.

ERATIO SMEARED

This "review" just up at Web Del Sol, by Tim McGrath: mcgrattf@bc.edu :

"Eratio Postmodern Poetry =A0 ://=A0 View | Rating:
Eratio offers up incomprehensible postmodern fodder for critics of=20
postmodern incomprehensibility. Good luck finding anything=20
intentionally; look for links and find a blog, look for poetry and find=20=

quotations. And when you realize that Eratio's editor, Gregory Vincent=20=

St. Thomasino (whose name suggests either a pseudonymously guarded=20
narcissist or the tragi-comic hero of a Wes Anderson film) has included=20=

his own embarrassing asseverations ("Discourse is like a river" is his=20=

unqualified and deplorably facile, but apparently quotable, simile)=20
along with the words of Nietszche, Plato, and Jung, you'll start=20
wondering whether this postmodern experiment is, in fact, a postmodern=20=

parody. On the same page, alongside the luminous Lord Duke G.V. St.=20
Thomasino, Diane Wakoski is quoted as saying, "I feel that poetry is=20
the completely personal expression of someone about his feelings and=20
reactions to the world. I think it is only interesting in proportion to=20=

how interesting the person who writes it is." By Wakoski's logic, the=20
people who bring you Eratio are not very interesting at all."


Friends, as contributors to eratio postmodern poetry, you should=20
proudly count yourselves among some of the most talented and=20
influential writers and artists on the scene today. As editor of the=20
site, I can honestly say that many of the works submitted for eratio=20
simply do not make the cut (and I'm sorry if I've rejected your work,=20
Mr. McGrath, but there's always the welcome to send again).=A0 I try to=20=

be fair when making these judgments, because I know what it means to=20
put your heart into something (especially something like poetry), and=20
how it feels to be rejected.

Eratio is a labor of love, since it generates no revenue for me (but=20
rather costs me time and energy and money). Each issue requires months=20=

of work, involving coding, design, correspondence, planning, and an=20
immeasurable amount of frustration. Ultimately, it's very gratifying --=20=

but I cannot say it's fun.

Still, I am proud to publish your work and hope that its presence at=20
eratio gives you some exposure and some degree of satisfaction that you=20=

otherwise would not have had, and gives you some encouragement to=20
continue being a poet in an economy that doesn't much care about you.

I do not know Tim McGrath. But if you read him closely you'll see that=20=

this is nothing more than a personal attack on me (based on his dislike=20=

of my name!). I am distressed because none of the poetry or artworks=20
are mentioned, and in fact I do not believe Mr. McGrath even bothered=20
to read or look at any of it. (But can he, indeed, talk about the=20
poetry, or the content of the page, or the logic of the concept, I=20
wonder? Why the subterfuge of fixating on my name? No one of any real=20
insight or wit would do that -- unless he were inclined to burlesque.)

As a poet and a critic, I take great care to explicate my reasons for=20
"liking" or "disliking" something. More importantly, I consider it my=20
responsibility to try to place a work into context, to appreciate what=20=

it is the poet is trying to achieve, and to assess whether this has=20
been accomplished (and sometimes I offer alternatives, but I never=20
ridicule and I am never disrespectful, and I always manage to point out=20=

a poet's successes). There are several reviews in the current issue=20
that I took great care in writing, I hope you'll see them for yourself=20=

now that the issue is up.

Reading Tim McGrath's personal attack (on my name, for Pete's sake!) is=20=

an example of something a poet or a critic should never do. Mr. McGrath=20=

has latched on to my name as something that irritates him a great deal,=20=

and in the process has ignored your work and mine. Why does Mr. McGrath=20=

dislike me personally? Could it be that this is payback? (Or else:=20
What's "pseudonymously guarded" about it? What's "narcissist" about it?=20=

I will, however, accept that being a Roman Catholic name it is somewhat=20=

"tragi-comic.")

Mr. McGrath's tone -- glib, cynical, condescending, and uninformed and=20=

lacking of the requisite vocabulary to comprehend let alone explicate=20
or set a value upon "the postmodern" -- is indicative not only of Web=20
Del Sol but of the "unlettered lad" generally. I do not know why Web=20
Del Sol has adopted this attack mentality toward anything to do with=20
"the postmodern," but for sure it is the creativity of resentment.

genesis genesis redux revisited

The explanation:

genesis genesis redux is a reduction of the book of Genesis, the originary
book from which the spiral of monotheism extends. Creation exists in the
performativity of speech; "God says," which of course presupposes a
language, sound and an atmosphere to convey it, throat, vocal cords, lips,
teeth, and tongue to configure it.

"God says," and it is done, completed, vocalization into matter. But there
remains, at the beginning, as if in reverse, the remnant, the speaking
itself, the origin and material grounding of that language, Hebrew,
Akkadian, Assyrian, Ugaritic, for example, from which creation ensues.
Wherever the account begins, began, in whatever district, desert, forest,
marshland.

A word is created only once. The creation of the word proceeds from the
existence of language; language is always already there, just as
information is: If we only had the means and patience to read it!

genesis genesis redux borrows and extends the materialization of language;
it also works through the aesthetics of the Thousand Character Essay.
Ellen Zweig and I have been translating this, it seems, forever, stumbling
across difficult classical Chinese, without any background 'for this sort
of thing.' In the Essay, a thousand different characters are used; the
essay itself is a thousand characters long, and there is no repetition.
One begins anew with each character, and here we are.

genesis genesis redux transforms the book of Genesis, and this is a better
transformation than one I had previously completed, this is more accurate.

This transformation is, and must be, the originary text of language, and
therefore must be Important, and a source for scholars of Revelation in
English.

The words in genesis genesis redux are all unique; the programming below
(with eliminate.pl a perl program by Florian Cramer, upon my request)
takes the original text, such as King James would have it, and eliminates
all redundancy. Every word is returned to its primordial uniqueness,
regardless of syntax and placement. As such, the text descends into
increasingly terse languaging, since the more common words are of course
eliminated early on. By the end of it, the protolanguage code of all
enunciation appears; the whole constitutes a supplication to language
itself, my own production of the Word of God, with no emendation, with a
purity that would have been well nigh inconceivable before the digital
age.

Here is an accounting.
cat genesis.txt | tr -cs A-Za-z '\012' | tr A-Z a-z > yy
perl eliminate.pl < yy > redux.txt
where eliminate.pl is below:
#!/usr/local/bin/perl5
while (<STDIN>) {
      @words = split /[\s]+/, $_;
      @spaces = split /[\S]+/, $_;
      for ($x=0; $x <= $#words; $x++) {
          $word_count{$words[$x]}++;
  if ($word_count{$words[$x]} == 1) {print $words[$x],$spaces[$x+1]}
                 }
         }

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present
on Friday, February 18, 2005 at 7 p.m.
(note special time, plus free admission!)
Borderline starring H.D. & Paul Robeson
introduced by Susan McCabe
cosponsored with the Visual Criticism Program at CCA

Borderline (1930), starring H.D., Bryher, Paul and Eslanda Robeson, was
ground-breaking for its treatment of race and sexuality. Director Kenneth
Macpherson edited Close Up (1927-33), the first journal dedicated to film as a
modernist art form. According to the British Film Institute, "The narrative is
relatively simple, depicting an inter-racial love triangle, but Borderline's
attempts to portray the extreme psychological states of its characters render
it a quite complex film, [one which] concentrates on the inner states of its
protagonists, using a technique that H.D. referred to as 'clatter-montage', in
which rapid montage combinations create an effect close to superimposition."

Susan McCabe's books include the poetry collection Swirl (Red Hen Press,
2003); as well as Elizabeth Bishop: Her Poetics of Loss (Penn, 1994); and new
from Cambridge UP, Cinematic Modernism: Modern Poetry and Film. Her
introduction to the new edition of Bryher's Visa for Avalon has just been
published (Paris Press, 2004), and she has begun work on a critical biography,
Bryher: Female Husband of Modernism. She teaches at USC.

Maria,

Every time one of these enticing Dactyl Foundation
open mike announcments has appeared on this list, I've
wondered: if one is presenting very short poems, does
one really have to stop after 3, even if that leaves
one way shy of 10 minutes?  I'm not saying that would
be an unbearable rule--I'm just wondering what's the
case, (and what's the rationale).

Hello Aaaron,

I just read some of your fabulous work and was compelled to write
immediately.  My name is Deborah Grayson and I'm a Registered Poetry
Therapist (yes, there is indeed such an amazing thing...) and regional
director in Fort Lauderdale Fla of the National Association for Poetry
Therapy.  Our website is www.poetrytherapy.org.

Our next conference will be in St. Louis, Mo. May 3-8th.  Gregory Orr will
be our keynote poet, yours truly will be your keynote speaker and tons of
talented and inspiring people will be offering workshops and readings
throughout this wonderful extravaganza.  Thought you'd like to know about
it!

Meanwhile, Bangs looked like it was a fabulous collection.  I wish you
continued success with your work.

In Poetry and Peace,
Deborah Grayson, LMHC, RPT

Poetry therapy has been around for something over 20 years. It's something
like journal therapy or reminiscence workshops--the client expresses, works
through issues, expression is interpreted back, discussed, etc. Done
individually or in groups. Note that this has very little to do with what
most of us call poetry, but a lot about confessionalism as practiced by
Greg Orr, whose first two books (if memory serves--we knew each other back
then, but I couldn't read another word without barfing) were an attempt to
deal with his having accidentally killed his younger brother when he was
himself a young child.

I have the same fears, being a serialist and all - I mean do I read for ten=
 minutes and end in the middle of a serial or do I read three serials (whic=
h would end up taking me to the twenties)? I'm not being facetious, just ad=
ding to the humour... It's egalitarian all the way and up for interpretatio=
n. Good job, Dactyl!

Not to make light of the normal rituals of a death, but maybe we can also
see this one as Arthur Miller's last piece, last performance. I just
suggested to my local bookstore (ironically called "The Phoenix"!) to place
"The Crucible" and "Death of a Salesman" and other other works in the front
window. (There amongst N Choamsky, H. Zinn, etc.)

During the fifties' witch hunts  it was probably more often than not
activist Jews who were called into the hearings and trials. Today it's Arabs
and Arab Americans. (That's if they even get out of confinement to be
formally accused.)

It's ironic that "The Crucible" as well as Orwell's "1984" are required
reading in California high schools. One would think that the alarms in those
books - as if they would now be part of our DNA - would automatically inform
and compel public outrage against this selective death of the constitution.
Contrarily, it seems, much of the public has an infinite capacity to absorb
Bush & Co's  lies and contradictions - each one combined with the
repetitious incantations and calls for "Freedom." Real stomach turners.

I hope we can, at least, hope that this, Miller's, last performance, will
revive his work, as well as his transparent sense of public alarm.

Sorry I didn't pick up on your earlier post, Richard -- I'm currently
suffering from Severe Attention Deficit -- but I *did* like your satire.

                <g>

And I think I noticed that Mary somewhere mentions Robert Graves.

... partly I agreed (being someone who cut his poetic teeth as a teenager on
Graves, and has an anomalous relation to The White Goddess, both book and
concept) but I'd disagree with Mary (unless I picked her up wrongly in one
of her later posts) that Graves is a less-than-major poet.

Depends which poems you look at, and for a time, Graves' (after at the
latest the 68 Collected) seemed to dump his best poems for new trash.

But now there's a nice new (three volumes in hardback with notes, one volume
in a Penguin paperback if you just want the actual texts) Complete,
Re-edited, with even the hard-to-get war poems.  Gorgeous.

            ... as to Laura (Riding) Jackson, well ...

I hope this makes sense -- at the moment, I have a worrity bug crawling
around the guts of my hard disk, which among other things seems to have
trashed the Folder Association where I dump things.  This means that I
wake-up to 120+ *unsorted* emails, which makes it hard to follow a thread
sometimes.

        No shit!!!!

This is great writing, not because of what you say about me but because it
builds on its own oddly Whitmanesque but also Celine of all people in the
excitement, I'd focus on this yourself, you don't need us, just of course
your own voice which comes through - of course also thank you for the
compliments which make me uncomfortable, at least if I'm deleted by x,y,z,
they won't know of the discomfort, think I'm taking it all in, lucky lucky
me, it's a ghost they're unreading, unraveling, in their non-reading,
non-raveling - I do feel odd of course in replying of course, here, they
won't know that it will be our little secret

Thanks (Mairead and Mary  and Alan )! I wasn't sure if I should have pushed
the send button.I morphed into a strange state of mind last night - wasnt
sure if I was writing crap  - getting to invasive or silly or whatever - or
what I was doing - I'm trying, I
suppose, if I'm trying anything, to do kind of poetry that is also
"confessionalist" but also kind of phenomelogic -not that I have studied
Husserl etc etc (my definitions of phemonenology basically are from my large
Concise Oxford Enclyclopaedic Dictionary and I put my own interpretation on
that  also) Alan does the "poesay" much better I feel or - I mean - not
better -but more logically "connected"  that said the 'essays' from Alan
(the
ones - whichever they are short or long waves as he desribes them in some
(intro to The Internet Text) of the 'texts" or more "expository seeming" -
possibly they are either deconstructed themselves or are deconstructions of
part of a general deconstruction - but I don't really  understand that term
too well -but they have maybe "slippage" etc - the words evade me here they
"slipe slide, perish etc" - but they are like Nick Piombino's in his book
"Theoretical Objects" in which his questioning and questing poetics or his
poetry is philosophy actioned or it is somewhere between philosphy
psychology and poetry - or it is all -or all poetry is also all these and
more - the language is frequently more ( keyword = more) - more abstract
(abstract is problematic)  than say Silliman (who is good at zooming (in) on
particulars - George Bowering likes particulars) Bernstein and Heijnian
(just some of the many I could name) (all very varied I realise)  - some of
those in the Language Group (which  of course -well its problematic to
define what that group is) - but it is closer to these writers - but also
has some characteristics of Alans' essays - which often are at the edge of
"not"
being essays..."poessays" - then there are all the other things going on in
\the Internet Text - but I noticed some similarities betwen those two
writers (just to pluck one example of two I know).... (maybe of theme and
subject and some possibly stylistic

I was kind of talking myself up then down then got a bit dramatic when I
realised I was "on air"  -of  course I put myself on air so to speak..

Maybe I will have to start a Blog and disappear...every man woman and their
dog are doing blogs nowadays.

I will continue to talk to myself and others - so hopefully I wont
disappear.

Here is some interactive video for you:
http://vispo.com/kearns/modemspeed2.htm . It's called 'Not Negotiating a New
Canadian Constitution' and uses a 1974 video poem by Lionel Kearns, Gordon
Payne, and Peter Huse called 'Negotiating a New Canadian Constitution'.

The interactivity comes about largely via either clicking the video in the
lower left-hand corner or, equivalently, the 'bonk button' at top left.
Repeated clicks and then mousings around reveal different ways to not
negotiate a new Canadian constitution and a different approach to video on
the web. There are also a couple more buttons at top left to adjust time and
volume.

The video is part of a larger work called 'On Lionel Kearns'. If the first
part of 'On Lionel Kearns' at http://vispo.com/kearns is concerned with
binary process, then you might say this is the unary part. The binary theme
is concerned with the on off the yes no the 0 1 the nothing something the
content form the hot cold the ouch oh the sex death the bang bang the the
the. But 'Not Negotiating a New Canadian Constitution' is just plain 'no'.

Robin,

Graves is definitely a major poet but more importantly a genius whose  poetic
language theory remains largely unexplored or validated. Actually, I  think
he proved his theory so thoroughly and painstakingly that no one wants to
dispute it. Thanks for the heads up on new publications. His work historically
traces the thought-language transition from the matriarchal feminine view of
life to the patriarchal. Perhaps it was time for a change, but the greater
questions remains, why did it happen? Poetry had power and produced tangible
results in people's lives. That goddess formulaic poetry was both abruptly and
gradually usurped by the vulgar rhymesters of the cross & crown was no less
than a phenomenological and philosophical coup. However, most modern poetry has
staged another coup, in wresting it from the hands & lips of the vulgar
rhymesters of church and state. I'm satisfied that modern poetry has  accomplished
so much, and in fact, may have indeed returned it to those  subliminal &
quantum rhythms suggested earlier. Poetry is about everything  now, nothing taboo,
nothing sacred. I await something powerful and new in  language of which
poetry will play a great part in our society, something to  restore its potency,
like say a fertility or e.d. drug.

All I can say is:  Joseph Campbell.

Jung lives, Graves died (so to speak) in 1916.

Much as I admire Graves as a poet, there are better linguists.

What is a genius?

How does one recognise it?

Why is it so important that someone is one?

Are there any anthropologists or linguists working in say the past 20 years
who take the matriarchy/patriarchy shift seriously? Is there any evidence?

I know a fair number of people in the field, of all genders. Many are
active feminists. None think it merits a second thought. But my experience
is anecdotal. I'd be happy to hear otherwise.

Since you're not averse to taking a mocking tone, I feel empowered to tell
you what a ridiculous backwater the work of Jung & Campbell appears to
numbers of us. The "collective unconscious" model of culture hasn't been a
serious contender for decades, and I'm surprised to see Jung & Campbell
introduced as a contemporary rebuttal to anything. If laughable, Graves and
his theories are at least quaint and literary. For a real belly laugh check
out the book _Aryan Christ_ by Richard Noll --it's got all the dirt on Jung
and mystical Teutonic race-fantasy. --Remembering Robin's contributions to
last year's Tolkien debate, I expect he will question the relevance of race
in Jung's work. But has anyone seen the 1936 essay on "Wotan"? Achtung.

I shouldn't hate, because the same could be said about Georges Dumezil who
was a lifelong rightwinger and race-fantasist if not worse, and I find him
completely mesmerizing. But at least he was working with real data,
Indo-Euro linguistic data I mean, and historicizing it in a way that Jung
and Campbell never seem to have felt necessary. Really you couldn't have
named 2 bigger blockheads, sociologically speaking.

In answer to Mark's question about the matriarchy/patriarchy shift, I can
recommend a great article by Joan Bamberger, "The Myth of Matriarchy: Why
Men Rule in Primitive Culture" that appears in the collection _Women,
Culture, and Society_ (Stanford Univ.P., 1974). Again, watch those toesies
because she's a keen intellectual historian and rather a skeptic.

I'm not trying to fight, though. Happy Valentines LRSN

The thing I find most bracing about Graves is his insistence that his innate
poetic knowledge as a Poet trumps boring old rational theorising any day.
And why not?  It makes him a most intriguing fantasist, even if he does get
lost in his own metaphors.

Yes, Steve. All I can say to that is that Robert offered a not too  shocking
theory that women will a pul ye ass into the grave sooner or  later.
Fortunately, in his case it was much later. He was a glutton for  punishment after he
worshipped the golden ass of Laura Ryder.

Regarding scholarship, mythology, archaeology, and various  interdisciplinary
works have promoted the m/p 'thing' which is recorded in  religious texts
themselves if only in the minds of the male  reformers. Graves, Jung, Frazer, and
Campbell may not have been quantum  physicists but their ideas have entranced
thinkers/readers who long suspected  that religion had pulled the wool over
our powers of reasons for millenia. If it  wasn't for their efforts and
inspiration, they'd still be teaching creationism  in public schools as fact rather
than a part of mythology. Also, I think  the abundant Gilgamesh studies provide
evidence of the m/p shift. Genius is that  rare creative ability to synthesis
ideas and provide insight and meaning where  old structures of understanding
are failing. Genii are like muses that inspired  them.

Or is it "Jung is wasted on the Youth"? Hi Nick, and sorry for all the good
things about Jung I'm sure I slighted in my post. I have nothing to say
against the therapeutic value of his work, only the cultural history. And
I'm sure I don't even know enough about that. Hope this finds you well,
take care --David L.

Abstract for the Roundtable Discussion=20
with Jena Osman:

Poet-critic Joan Retallack has described the poethical art form as "a =
form
of life in which we would, in our most enlightened moments, want to live =
-
[that] which makes the intricate complexity of the intersecting =
intentional
and accidental that is our world known to us through the sensory and
imaginative enactment of complex forms" ("Accident ...Aeroplane
...Artichoke"). I've been thinking about this concept in relation to a
comment Anne Waldman made a year or so ago at the Kelley Writers House =
in
Philadelphia about how now is a time of "outrageous metaphor and =
terrible
misnomers," what she called a kind of "interior terrorism." She said =
that
the best thing we can do right now as writers is study euphemism.
Poet-critic Barrett Watten said in a talk called "War=3DLanguage" that =
"We
need to take the mechanized hardware of the language of war apart - by
locating alternate evidence in multiple media, by questioning the
pseudo-objectivity of its delusional conclusions, by unpacking its =
embedded
metaphors and narrative frames, by thinking otherwise." There seemed to =
be a
necessary hope that as writers, pointing to language itself is a first =
step
toward action. But in what ways is that pointing poethical? Are there =
ways
to critique the topical world, the world of events, while at the same =
time
providing alternative "poethical" forms? In other words, in what ways =
can
words in poems make war, and in what ways can they make peace?

This indeed a grave matter - but are we at Graves End?

I was reading some of Graves poetry last night - and a lot is quite
beautiful and unique - but so far cant say his criticism of Eliot and Pound
were jsutified - both are greater poets - but in a sense he has been
"neglected" - but he has not really contributed to 20th Cent developments
inliterature of a radical kind - Riding maybe different - I believe she was
had some original and fierce ideas...passionate about the truth of words etc
- her famous hiatus

but to be fair or unfair as the case may or may not be -  I havent read
muchof Graves - aminlysen the TV progarm "I Caludius ' as discussed with
Robin . that was excellent - I believe his book on Greek Myhtolgy is good
also.

"Graves died" -- I was thinking specifically of the edge-of-death phenomenon
he describes in GoodbyeTAT, when he was almost blown apart by a German
shell.

I should have made this clearer, but I'd distinguish between Campbell and
Jung.

Campbell (and I'm sorry to be so crude) strikes me as a boring fart who
never had a single original idea in his life.  Jung, in contrast, while
ofter barking mad, seems to me (still) interesting.  (Though there is a
problem in that, unlike Freud and as far as I can judge from the English
translations of his work, he wrote badly.)

I linked the three -- obviously awkwardly -- as examplars of myth-creation.

I wouldn't base *any* linguistic, let alone psychoanalytical, theory on
their work.

(Linguistically, I suppose I'm closest to Halliday.  Give me a formalist
Edinburgh Maoist any day.  Psychology I simply know nothing about, except to
recognise that whatever importance Jung has, it isn't based on the efficacy
of his therapeutic methods.)

Did I?  If so, I apologise

I think more than that -- _Survey of Modernist Poetry_ (the bits Graves
wrote, not Riding) is a pretty seminal EngLit text (Empsom picked-up on
parts of it in 7Types, and it's worn better than Leavis in ways), and as
well as the poetry, his novels -- both the Claudius ones and, say, _Antigua
Penny Puce and "The Shout" -- aren't to be discounted.

However (and I'm sorry if I gave this impression) I don't think any of the
three, Campbell, Graves, or Jung, are reliable "scholarly" guides.

Actually, what I find it most difficult to forgive Jung for is the utter
nonsense of his commentary on Flying Saucers.  But then, we all get old,
some faster than others.

Dunno if this makes things better or worse, or more or less clear

Me neither.

Subject:      The Letter
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

The Letter


Yesterday, Azure and I found a letter in a second-hand book on ecology.
The letter was from a prisoner in a New York State correctional facility.
It was addressed to a woman in Queens, New York.

The letter used the word "nigga" extensively, and threatened to kill the
married "nigga" who was fucking his woman, whom he loved. It was four
pages in length, and veered wildly from death threats to protestations of
love. It was awkwardly written, and the prisoner apologizes for the poor
quality of the paper, almost school notebook paper, the kind with the thin
blue lines.

My impulse was to 'make a work' from the letter, which had been discarded
in the book, to use the text in one or another fashion. But the text
seemed too powerful, too angry, too sad, to do anything with it. I talked
it over with Azure and our friends. At one point, I was going to throw it
out; at another, file it away as a reminder of the vastly different worlds
present in slaughter-america under the bush regime. I finally decided the
best was to remail the letter in the original envelope to the original
recipient. Perhaps she had lost it, perhaps it had frightened her so much
that she subconsciously left it behind when she turned the book in for
textbook credit. Our friends gave us two stamps and tape, and with the
envelope resealed, I sent it on its way though a local mailbox.

On the envelope I wrote, 'found this in a book and thought you may want
it.' I didn't sign it, the separation was permanent.

I had an odd sense of loss, which haunts me. I have used found materials
if they 'resonate' before - for example, webcam images that are then
transformed, arranged, semantically 'intensified.' But this letter was too
strong - or if not strong - violent - or if not violent - symptomatic - it
was too dis/comforting, as if real life permanently intruded on what, in
my work, in all work, can be at best metaphoric conceits, no matter how we
think otherwise.

The letter was uncanny. It demanded, it appeared to demand, to be read,
absorbed, to fit in, as if returning were a coward's way out - for there
was no indication that she would have done anything but discarded it,
perhaps after class. The envelope was thick, immediately evident within
the pages of the ecology text, surely she would have put it away,
somewhere, anywhere, if she had wanted to save it. And the undeniable
violence of it all mitigated against this, I could only imagine that she
had moved on, that she wanted as much distance as possible from the
writer, that the letter was a reminder of an uncomfortable past, one which
could never be absorbed, could never fit in with her current lifestyle.
The letter was close to illiterate, she was in college, and the text was
somewhat advanced, with a cdrom illustrating ecological processes, and
quite clearly often played.

There is a weakness and pretense in all writing, in all art, as if 'my
love is like a red, red, rose' said anything at all that rearranged the
molecular epistemology of things on the planet. Art murmurs presumably to
the soul, it calls us to action, makes us feel better about the world, or
gives us an expressivity for the violent tendencies of the times. Or it
allows us to push the boundaries of comfort, dis/comfort, in new ways, for
dis/comfort speaks in art of a 'newness' that is non-existent. It takes
one letter in a book on ecology to contradict each and every other form of
cultural construction, a letter from a sender who had no idea whatsoever
that it would form the punctum of an essay, nor, I suspect, would he care.
He would care about his woman who was no longer his woman, his love who
had betrayed him, and he would kill the perpetrator of that betrayal who
surely was not her.

This short essay can't go anywhere, it can only point to a found object, a
letter, which could not be subsumed. And within that lack, on my part, is
an incredible selfishness, that the debris of the world is there, in the
first place, to be used. To be primordially used. To be used by a writer
or an artist. To be absorbed, to be robbed of originary content. And while
that may be the premise and promise of art, it remains a hole in this
page. Debris is never debris, or it is someone's, or it is no one's, but
it is never debris, just like there are never vermin or weeds, words which
I detest for their inherent elitism. Debris is nothing but the world, and
it is the world which rends and renders artwork useless, meaningless, at
best with meaning grafted by the reader who has no choice.

my definition of a boombasta afrougiosie: the impotence of revolution in
a corperate tranquility

the question on the floor massa speaka was;

"Whats keeping us from doing what Middle East Militants do?"

actually, it's not just the middle eastern resistence/freedome fighters
who are "fighting the power". it is the entire world -- peep the
papers... check the few free press griots

hell........

while we get right wing extremist sellouts = condi rice, colin powell
and barack obama ("afrikan"?) -- 60yr old white women, pissed off white
kids, natives youth and 12yr so called "arabs" are doing more for the
cause of justice, light and freedome than the north amerikkkan so called
afrikan.

...now.

unfortunately, the so called "afrikan" of north amerikkka, who resides
in the belly of the beast (of what is the greatest threat to world
freedome justice equalty and have/are murdered (ing) houndreds of
thousands of people around the world -- if not in their own country) is
so controlled and infultrated that the moment any threat to the
establishement even blinks, the govt operatives, or rass corperate whore
wanna bes, are ready to attack, discredit, ostrasize, distract (the
masses), neutralize, humiliate and have imprisioned and have killed the
dissident (s) since the times of marcus garvey and the agent 800 to this
very day.

the afroamerikkkanadian, especially since the hip hop "take em out"
attitude was approved by corperate amerikkka, is too busy aktin like
"crabs in the barral" = attacking any threat to what might stand between
establishing themselves as the top o de pop cult torture and scrilla, to
clic (k) up and do what the rest of the world is/are doing.

it was always about, not freedome justice equality b.u.t., shufflin like
the jeffersons or walking like utraamerikkkan w.a.s.p. and gettin a
'peice o de pie' squared to the massive accumulation of stuff, a credit
rating and maybe a taxbreak.

"For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.
They may temporarily allow us to beat him down at his own game,
but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change." - Audre Lorde

remember the main point in the f.b.i and, prior to that, the colonial
powers, in the directive to the control of the, what william carlos
williams refered as, "pure products of ameri(kkk)a" = (blacks in north
amerikkka) was to insure they did not get a black "messiah" and to
destroy the black male. ...all nonpassive (freethinking -- if not --
analytical) black males are to be considered possible black "messiahs"
or candidates in the running for the doomed position and, therefore; are
to be considered threats to the system.

...and so all black males (as is the case with native males in kkkanada),
under the age of 18yr, are in especially grave danger of death via urban
accidents = (police or opertatives or self esteem demolition techniques
to guns or drugs/down to dumbed = narcotization) who remain rebellious
and seek actualization = to destratify/deterrorialize

...who gain speed to jump to the next plateux.

...black males (like other internal opertatives) are assigned to destroy
the
black male; more than a few black women, under the guise of white
euro feminazism, have done their share.

I am

dat was dah plan my mayn

...now (since islam and muslims, urban guerillas and dissidents have been
and are too radical and seemingly untamable for the massa of the house)
the trend is to "distract" the black youth with a vision of an
unattainable, undefinable, sublime commercialized "afrikan"
consciuosness CONtroLLed by the few in a mongolian cluster f**k point
system like pyramid scam = create a reservation stylee currupt "elder"
system to control the masses of rowdy black youth under the guise of
guidence (keep them occupied with ritual and away from resistence --
with apolly ogies to stuart hall). anyone, who even questions, adds on,
or criticizes this or asks too many questions -- as is in the case with
amerikkka and terrorism (you're with us or against us and
"daemonacracy"), the gay community (homophobia), the so called left
(paranoia and suburban colonial middle -class white supremacy) and
communism (dissidents and nonpersons) -- is immediatley assaulted on all
fronts which pertain the profiled catagory they have been assigned to
-- thus dealt with accordingly.

"...the Amerikkkan Empire today... is hell bent on acting out it's plans
for global hegemony,..., to usurp such resources from the poor and destitute
and re-apportion them to the fatcats that helped to create and sustain the
Empire. To spread the corruption and vice that infects it's own society
and that it's own people speak out against...."
-- from "Muharram the month of revolution"*

listen...hear here.....

now, it is very easy to decieve the general afroamerikkkan peoples
because amerikkkan educational system is so poor and even worse in lower
income and minority neighbourhoods -- latino, black, natives and poor
whites. therefore, it is easy to get them to become suspicious of the
ever feared "intellectual" and the "other" -- considering these under
privilaged peoples (the masses) are kept in north amerikkkan
concentration camps of innercities, trailor parks, shot gun shacks,
barrios and reservations while FED (govt) crap for news and daily events
and their cultures and economic state are criminalized as they are kept
in a state of, as bruh chuck d states; "thinking like an animal" or
criminal = behavioral modification -- or nas' "black zombie";

"Yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow? All we are
is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes? And you believe when they be
tellin you lie, all on the media? They make the world look crazy to keep
you inside? ...You scared to be yourself, cause you in a trance/Feel
free, hear the music and dance/If you cared what they think, why wear
what they wear, just for you Dumb niggaz with long beards like they
Arabs or Jews or from Israel, bis'ma Allah, Al-Rahman, Al-Rahim Islam's
a beautiful thing And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring peace
against the darkness, which is unGodly..."

...and these, the poor, the working class, the masses are the balance in
the equations to topple the world domination of north amerikkkan and
e.u. slave masters. ...so it is important to "passify" them and control
them and to distract them...

what a better way than to have people who look and chat them up just

while the world targets the enemy - the so called "afrikan" of north
amerikkka targets each other and hollas about "revolution" to the
most ut pop charts (while using garvey and other members of the
dead negro society) as a propaganda tool, for the establishement =
to cast suspicion, humiliate, control world knowledge, "universality",
discredit and then pimp anti-intellectualism = fascism as black
consciousness ... when it is actaully another attempt by the few
at the top and the climbers to CON and troll through the masses.

the tactricks have become more sophisticated and there is not an
organization ... except for perhaps the n.o.i and those who remain
unlimited = stay clear of affiliations-- which has not been completely
controlled from the top.

however, the greatest radical move would be to break out of the ghetto,
barrio and reservation mentality, identity politricks, drop the played
out sun tzu and go defend or feed afrika and not chat about it; to not
wear bad played out dashiki vines or use it as rank... just get on the
dissidents tip of nonsuburban direct action = resistance... cuz ain't
nobody gives a mofo that your name means 'sun runner ancestor hugger' in
fake swahili.

hell yell ¡YA! even the black panthers thought these dudes were posers
and passive agressive back inn DAH daze = 'pour me a libation', yo.
peep the "panthers" script by melvin van peebles

street rebellology (unlimited)?

personally, if you gonna have a sight, in these times, which big ups
cuba, assata shakur (http://www.assatashakur.org/) and claims "afrikan"
and "revolution" -- i'm sorry to say my friends, no dis to the sis, that
it is going to be run and infultrated to the max by the powers who
should not be and attempt to numb all action and rebels, rebellion and
keep it at a yawn.

basically, our revolution is like an mc battle or dmc -- alot hollerin,
tricks and play b.u.t. ain't nobody sayin nothin and we target each
other as threats to success in master's house.

the neoafrikan dissassembled

it is best to keep clear of the afrougoisie.

the revolution shall not be wy fi'ed.

"How do you say "Anger" for example is "Moral" or "Immoral?" There are
things to be angry about and things not to be angry about. Similarly,
adab, or manners is delegated to the sort of Southern Belle mannerisms:
"Put your fork here when you sit at the table and your napkin here; say
'excuse me' after you belch, and always hold the door for ladies." This
is not what adab is dealing with. For just as in such Southern
societies, etiquette is considered a virtue, but backbiting and gossip
are traditional mainstays. The same Southern families which would hold
"etiquette" in such high regard would also ruthlessly beat slaves
working in their plantations. The same who would consider etiquette so
essential would treat `asabiyyah, racism, nationalism, and tribalism as
though it were normal and acceptable." -- Abu Jamaal -- "Forgiving Those Who Tresspass..."

>

Alan - impulsively I say you were right to do what you did. Even if you
could accurately inscribe intention around your discovery of the letter (the
sender wanted somebody to see it before a threat could be fulfilled, or the
receiver wanted to lose it as some form of banishment, etc., etc.) - I think
the use of the for an art project would be like taking a person's picture
without asking for permission to do so.    Asking for permission often puts
something much more interesting into motion, such as a fuller sense of
disclosure by both artist and subject, and the realized 'art object' can be
much the richer from this process. At least that has been my experience.
(And I suspect yours.) Thieving the subject  I never find similarly
rewarding. A little cheap, I feel after.

Sending the letter back anonymously, undoubtedly will set something in
motion. The only regret is that you will never know what!

Alan,
I taught at Soledad Correctional Facility in Gonzales, CA in 1966; funny =
thing about that letter of yours, it reminded me of my days as an =
instructor in aircraft electronics in the U.S.A.F.  Back in that =
classroom, all the folks (males only back then) wore their fatigues and =
came to class clean shaven and almost sparkling.  They were attentive, =
obedient, and bright.

At the prison, I taught HS English to folks attempting to complete their =
HS education; in class one afternoon, I remember the moment well, I =
stood before the class about to attempt to lead a discussion on the =
poetry of W. Whitman, and I looked out over the room and saw all the men =
in their prison fatigues, clean shaven, (males only), obedient, bright =
and sparkling with a kind of intellectual interest.  And I remember =
feeling that de ja vu horror...for a moment I really didn't know where I =
was. =20

But there's more to the tale than that.

I spent a year on that faculty.  I found chaps I had no trouble =
identifying with...worse, I found no one who was guilty!

There were rapists, robbers, con men and a whole host of violent men =
angry at the society, all of whom were innocent.  I never met a guilty =
convict.  And after spending time reviewing their files and chatting =
with them, I came to realize, there really were no guilty men.  There =
were only men who lacked the money to prove their innocence or to =
confuse the facts.  =20

All of that useless information though evades the questions: is the =
loyalty and love among the criminal element as fervent, as the love of =
the upper class?  And more, does the racism language increase the fervor =
of the relationship?  And even worse, is there a motive on the part of =
the writer of any letter that drives action from one who reads the =
letter?  And is that motive honorable?=20

Interesting questions those...sorry I have no answers. =20

But I do have this...one of my students, a particularly bright chap =
(I'll call him Robert here) who had a flair for writing, one day asked =
me if I would mind taking a letter to his sister.  Now, mind you, I had =
already been warned by the warden and the captain of security that cons =
would ask me to do things for them, for favors, so I was prepared to say =
"No" to such a request. =20

And I did say "No."  But not without chatting first with Robert. =20

At the conclusion of my talks, I heard this: "Mr. Saliby, I was a robber =
before I got in here; I'm a robber now, and I'll be a robber whenever I =
leave this place."  Those were Roberts words.=20

I read Robert's jacket; I read his court case files and I learned, he =
didn't lie to me; he was a robber. I'm certain, where ever he is =
today...he's still a robber. =20

His letter to his sister, which I did not deliver, was more a confession =
of Robert's sins than a plea for forgiveness.  I felt when I read the =
note that I should have delivered it because it placed the man in the =
light of honesty he saw himself.  And while I did follow the rules of =
the institution, I've often felt guilty for not having disobeyed those =
rules and taken that note to the man's sister....who knows how that =
might have altered his life or hers.

Sorry for the lengthy diatribe here...it's just your note struck a cord =
of familiarity with me.

  The Letter


  Yesterday, Azure and I found a letter in a second-hand book on =
ecology.
  The letter was from a prisoner in a New York State correctional =
facility.
  It was addressed to a woman in Queens, New York.

  The letter used the word "nigga" extensively, and threatened to kill =
the
  married "nigga" who was fucking his woman, whom he loved. It was four
  pages in length, and veered wildly from death threats to protestations =
of
  love. It was awkwardly written, and the prisoner apologizes for the =
poor
  quality of the paper, almost school notebook paper, the kind with the =
thin
  blue lines.

  My impulse was to 'make a work' from the letter, which had been =
discarded
  in the book, to use the text in one or another fashion. But the text
  seemed too powerful, too angry, too sad, to do anything with it. I =
talked
  it over with Azure and our friends. At one point, I was going to throw =
it
  out; at another, file it away as a reminder of the vastly different =
worlds
  present in slaughter-america under the bush regime. I finally decided =
the
  best was to remail the letter in the original envelope to the original
  recipient. Perhaps she had lost it, perhaps it had frightened her so =
much
  that she subconsciously left it behind when she turned the book in for
  textbook credit. Our friends gave us two stamps and tape, and with the
  envelope resealed, I sent it on its way though a local mailbox.

  On the envelope I wrote, 'found this in a book and thought you may =
want
  it.' I didn't sign it, the separation was permanent.

  I had an odd sense of loss, which haunts me. I have used found =
materials
  if they 'resonate' before - for example, webcam images that are then
  transformed, arranged, semantically 'intensified.' But this letter was =
too
  strong - or if not strong - violent - or if not violent - symptomatic =
- it
  was too dis/comforting, as if real life permanently intruded on what, =
in
  my work, in all work, can be at best metaphoric conceits, no matter =
how we
  think otherwise.

  The letter was uncanny. It demanded, it appeared to demand, to be =
read,
  absorbed, to fit in, as if returning were a coward's way out - for =
there
  was no indication that she would have done anything but discarded it,
  perhaps after class. The envelope was thick, immediately evident =
within
  the pages of the ecology text, surely she would have put it away,
  somewhere, anywhere, if she had wanted to save it. And the undeniable
  violence of it all mitigated against this, I could only imagine that =
she
  had moved on, that she wanted as much distance as possible from the
  writer, that the letter was a reminder of an uncomfortable past, one =
which
  could never be absorbed, could never fit in with her current =
lifestyle.
  The letter was close to illiterate, she was in college, and the text =
was
  somewhat advanced, with a cdrom illustrating ecological processes, and
  quite clearly often played.

  There is a weakness and pretense in all writing, in all art, as if 'my
  love is like a red, red, rose' said anything at all that rearranged =
the
  molecular epistemology of things on the planet. Art murmurs presumably =
to
  the soul, it calls us to action, makes us feel better about the world, =
or
  gives us an expressivity for the violent tendencies of the times. Or =
it
  allows us to push the boundaries of comfort, dis/comfort, in new ways, =
for
  dis/comfort speaks in art of a 'newness' that is non-existent. It =
takes
  one letter in a book on ecology to contradict each and every other =
form of
  cultural construction, a letter from a sender who had no idea =
whatsoever
  that it would form the punctum of an essay, nor, I suspect, would he =
care.
  He would care about his woman who was no longer his woman, his love =
who
  had betrayed him, and he would kill the perpetrator of that betrayal =
who
  surely was not her.

  This short essay can't go anywhere, it can only point to a found =
object, a
  letter, which could not be subsumed. And within that lack, on my part, =
is
  an incredible selfishness, that the debris of the world is there, in =
the
  first place, to be used. To be primordially used. To be used by a =
writer
  or an artist. To be absorbed, to be robbed of originary content. And =
while
  that may be the premise and promise of art, it remains a hole in this
  page. Debris is never debris, or it is someone's, or it is no one's, =
but
  it is never debris, just like there are never vermin or weeds, words =
which
  I detest for their inherent elitism. Debris is nothing but the world, =
and
  it is the world which rends and renders artwork useless, meaningless, =
at
  best with meaning grafted by the reader who has no choice.

A strong answer (Alexander) to a strong mail (Alan).

To Alexander, I don't know if someone who was born a robber will
always be a robber. There is transformation, and by glimpsing at the
titles of the other threads (Graves-Graves etc.) it is symbolized in
the philosopher's stone. For those who did not understand it yet, and
according to this tale, we are the base metals and can change
ourselves into gold.

There is no transmuted gold out there to fulfil our desires. The less
by manipulating and confusing, not meant to you, but to some other out
there.

Care, Anny

>sorry really haven't been following any of this but what's a booojum?
>
I recommend a reading of the hunting of the snark; it's very good in parts

if the reference isn't recognised then i was wasting my time inadvertently

I'll come at it another way

I too came to this late with a claim that graves was not only a major poet
but more importantly a genius.

Now I am not too worried about the first half. I don't actually like terms
like major poet; but I have sufficient regard for his writing not to want to
find myself debating a quality that both accept. That kind of categorising,
eg x was a major poet, is not easily dealt with - we do evaluate, we do
compare: the problem is we don't agree. So the best thing to be done is to
try to identify what the individual making the claim means, what their terms
of reference are etc

I wouldnt have bothered except that claims were being made for Graves'
theories; which to me are... incorrect

I thought I could best counter *this false claim by asking what is meant by
"genius".

So I asked: "What is a genius? How does one recognise it? Why is it so
important that someone is one?"

and I got back "Genius is that  rare creative ability to synthesis ideas and
provide insight and meaning where  old structures of understanding are
failing. Genii are like muses that inspired  them."

which answers the first and not the second or third.

I don't think the second and third questions were unreasonable. The second
follows from the claim of genius, surely; and third from the claim that the
claim of genius is more important than the claim of major poet. Both claims
were made.

No explanation being forthcoming, I conclude that there is no consensual
means of identifying genius (borne out by the heterogeneity of the list of
those for whom I have heard the claim made over the years); and that there
is no particular reason why it should be important. This seriously weakens
the claim

But that leaves us with this:

"Genius is that  rare creative ability to synthesis ideas and provide
insight and meaning where  old structures of understanding are failing.
Genii are like muses that inspired  them."

Taking the second sentence first... Is this a report of what some claimed to
have believed or an actual claim of fact? If the former it's redundant
because I want to know how the word is being used in this thread, if the
latter then it assumes the veracity of the existence of muses and of
inspiration; and that surely requires some justification.

I remain to be persuaded. Which leaves us with:

"Genius is that  rare creative ability to synthesis ideas and provide
insight and meaning where  old structures of understanding are failing."

Well, if I had been offered that as a definition of a major poet, I think I
would be happier. Yet I have been led to believe that there is a marked
difference, making the genius more important. Clearly, it would have helped
had we been told how to recognise a genius; but that request was declined by
silence - as a kind of footnote to a reply to someone else.

One suspects that the rareness of this unrecognisable phenomenon will be
clerar when the rest is clear. Creative is a word used for everything from
needlecraft-by-numbers onwards. So, for the moment, I'll come back to
rareness and creativity.

It is an ability we are talking about. That is at least one clear statement.

I had feared that it might be a quality, like kingship, which all with eyes
can see, with Graves going round in some kind of Tolkien world giving out
his theory saying "This will cure you"

If it's an ability, we shall see it in action - an ability "to synthesis
ideas and provide insight and meaning where  old structures of understanding
are failing." What? Is he doing a doctorate then? A bit of the definition is
missing if so. What ideas? Any ideas? Insight into what? Etc

Genius is an ability. Well, I'm glad I waited for that.

Creativity is a slippery word. It is used a lot by people who are anything
but creative. I read a book not long ago which suggests creativity is
subject to market forces; so that when a body of work is no longer
considered creative, it isn't; and when it is, it is. But the book doesn't
say what it - creativity - is, except in those terms

Anyone want  a go with my bootlaces? Guaranteed to prove you knowledgeable.
No evidence required.

Rare - a rare creative ability -??? Don't see what that adds except to be
sure there won't be comparisons available

boojum tree - definition from gcide
   cirio \cirio\ n.
      the candlewood of Mexico and couthwestern California

Idria columnaris
       or
Fouquieria columnaris), having tall columnar stems and bearing
honey-scented creamy yellow flowers; --
      called also the boojum tree.


some images at http://helios.bto.ed.ac.uk/bto/desertecology/boojum.htm

Boojum at U of Arizona: http://arboretum.arizona.edu/boojum.html

from the Desert Ecology web site:

The boojum tree is one of the strangest plants imaginable. For most of the
year it is leafless and looks like a giant upturned turnip. Its common name
was coined by the plant explorer Godfrey Sykes, who found it in 1922 and
said "It must be a boojum!". In saying this, he was referring of the
strange and mythical creature that the author Lewis Carroll called a boojum
in his children's book, The Hunting of the Snark. The Spanish common name
for this tree is Cirio, referring to its candle-like appearance.

The plant itself is restricted to a relatively small region of the Baja
California peninsula of Mexico (but with a small population also on the
extreme western side of state of Sonora on the Mexican mainland). However,
within this restricted region it is very common and sometimes forms forests
that dominate the landscape on rocky hillsides or flat plains. In other
cases the boojum grows in mixed communities with two other characteristic
large stem succulents of the Baja California Desert - the giant cardon
cactus and the elephant tree (Pachycormus).

Individual boojum trees can live for up to 100 years, and possibly up to
300 years, reaching a height of 18 metres. But the wood of their trunks is
not very strong, so the plants are susceptible to damage by periodic
hurricanes, which probably limit their natural age. The trunks of boojums
often branch near the tops, and sometimes contort into strange shapes, even
bending to touch the ground. The trunks contain succulent tissues that
store moisture, so they are of the general type termed stem succulents.
They have greyish-white bark and for most of the year are dormant,
protected from water loss by a thick epidermal layer. Thin, pencil-like
branches arise along the length of the stem and rapidly produce thin,
rounded leaves in response to rain. These leaves soon wither and are shed
in drought conditions.

Boojums produce clusters of creamy white flowers at the tips of the trunks
in July-August. These flowers resemble the flowers of ocotillo and of
Adam's tree - both of which are very closely related plants in the ocotillo
family (Fouquieriaceae).

I love it when people talk about what they have done - or are doing -you
have taught Aircraft elctronics and also taught English in a prison - great!
I studied electronics - telecommunications and electronics and my last "real
" job was as an Engineering Tech in telecommuications of all kinds (for  the
then Government Power provider who have their own communications network)
and electronics of all kinds -eg PCM - Microwave - intercoms -
radio,telephone exchanges, of various kinds, modems, power supplies
9compuert controle, digital electronics of course in everything, on radio
and micrwave masts (setting up transceivers - aerials), instrumentation,
telephones, microwave, batteries, cabling, amplifiers,dBm (power) level
metering and etc PLCs etc etc and i then studied English ! And I've
forgotten most of it!

I visited prison once here as part of a progamme to visit prisoners - it was
chillng and an insight - prison is a place one doesnt want to go to - but my
son was in remand for a time: it made me think (Alans letter) of The
Shawshank Redemption -everyone was "innocent' - they wern't but I read upon
death row and a hell of a lot of them are - as you say they just cant afford
lawyers etc and then there is the people in Guantanamo a lot have just been
picked up and sold to the US ( they are not even terrorists): and I can
believe - that in a sense a lot of people are basically innocent - there
are some bad eggs of course - but many just drift and blunder into crime -
Alan shared another side of life with us (when I was in hospital last year I
shared a ward with a Maori guy who had spent 14 years in jail for varous
things and  he said "I also raped a woman, but then all women get raped (!)"
(His words) ..actually he had crushed his foot - interesting guy as it
hapenned - in a gang (he had been) -  ...  Alan's letter is fascinating - I
mean the whole story of  it... I've known the jealousy - evem planned to
kill men (or i deluded myslef I woudl kill - more likely )- it was 1989 -
and I was pretty messed up - I might have gone that way  - my ex had left me
and i was very angry - and i knew where a local gang met and could have
bought a gun (very unlikely I would ever do it -motdly it was bluster (I've
ber owned a gun - onlyfired one once I think - and basically cant fight my
way out of paper bag and am more or less a card carrying coward! I wil runa
away rarther than get a fist planted on my lovely old teeth!!) but at times
i started to imagine I was actually mad (and or some kind of "tough guy")
(I'm not -  if the phone goes i often jump in fright!! - as it only goes
once every 6 months or sometimes once in 5 years! -lol) I'm sacred shitless
of spiders!  (but I was building this mytholgy of myself)- the next step may
have been madness, destruction of others and self - jail for life whatever -
descent into hell......but mostly its was just talk and I even think my ex
and her friends got a frisson from it  -but things happened and gradually I
came to my senses - evry unlikely anything would anve ovmc of it - i never
ever hit a woman - in fact cant recall hitting anyone (except as  a child
maybe I hit "Teddy" or Dennis my brother!) - - but some guys dont
esitate  - they dont think conclusions through as I did -or they arent true
cowards as I am ! - it is possible you know - in some cases women get a
buzz out of all that stuff -tormenting the guy in prison with the lover  -or
maybe she didnt - one never knows  - she may have invented the lover - (the
permutations advance) some would maybe have made a complete break...a
mystery - the human heart - but sexual jealousy is the cause of many
homicides and has and will be for many (centuries -millenia) -probably for
ever
but in a sense the great  or  awesome thing about the letter is its complete
mystery - and in some ways that's sad -or the poignant aspect of it -
strange  it is - for some reason I think again of the film The Dead  (the
last story in The Dubliners by Joyce) - and the man whose wife once -long
ago - was loved by am young man who sacrificed his life for her and this man
cant get to her - he  is walled out from her self - her soul - her
eart  -even though he is her husband - has children by her - - he has never
felt that passion - or that depth of passion...he will never love her -
never be ready to die for her

Alan,
I taught at Soledad Correctional Facility in Gonzales, CA in 1966; funny
thing about that letter of yours, it reminded me of my days as an instructor
in aircraft electronics in the U.S.A.F.  Back in that classroom, all the
folks (males only back then) wore their fatigues and came to class clean
shaven and almost sparkling.  They were attentive, obedient, and bright.

At the prison, I taught HS English to folks attempting to complete their HS
education; in class one afternoon, I remember the moment well, I stood
before the class about to attempt to lead a discussion on the poetry of W.
Whitman, and I looked out over the room and saw all the men in their prison
fatigues, clean shaven, (males only), obedient, bright and sparkling with a
kind of intellectual interest.  And I remember feeling that de ja vu
horror...for a moment I really didn't know where I was.

But there's more to the tale than that.

I spent a year on that faculty.  I found chaps I had no trouble identifying
with...worse, I found no one who was guilty!

There were rapists, robbers, con men and a whole host of violent men angry
at the society, all of whom were innocent.  I never met a guilty convict.
And after spending time reviewing their files and chatting with them, I came
to realize, there really were no guilty men.  There were only men who lacked
the money to prove their innocence or to confuse the facts.

All of that useless information though evades the questions: is the loyalty
and love among the criminal element as fervent, as the love of the upper
class?  And more, does the racism language increase the fervor of the
relationship?  And even worse, is there a motive on the part of the writer
of any letter that drives action from one who reads the letter?  And is that
motive honorable?

Interesting questions those...sorry I have no answers.

But I do have this...one of my students, a particularly bright chap (I'll
call him Robert here) who had a flair for writing, one day asked me if I
would mind taking a letter to his sister.  Now, mind you, I had already been
warned by the warden and the captain of security that cons would ask me to
do things for them, for favors, so I was prepared to say "No" to such a
request.

And I did say "No."  But not without chatting first with Robert.

At the conclusion of my talks, I heard this: "Mr. Saliby, I was a robber
before I got in here; I'm a robber now, and I'll be a robber whenever I
leave this place."  Those were Roberts words.

I read Robert's jacket; I read his court case files and I learned, he didn't
lie to me; he was a robber. I'm certain, where ever he is today...he's still
a robber.

His letter to his sister, which I did not deliver, was more a confession of
Robert's sins than a plea for forgiveness.  I felt when I read the note that
I should have delivered it because it placed the man in the light of honesty
he saw himself.  And while I did follow the rules of the institution, I've
often felt guilty for not having disobeyed those rules and taken that note

Sorry for the lengthy diatribe here...it's just your note struck a cord of

  The Letter


  Yesterday, Azure and I found a letter in a second-hand book on ecology.
  The letter was from a prisoner in a New York State correctional facility.
  It was addressed to a woman in Queens, New York.

  The letter used the word "nigga" extensively, and threatened to kill the
  married "nigga" who was fucking his woman, whom he loved. It was four
  pages in length, and veered wildly from death threats to protestations of
  love. It was awkwardly written, and the prisoner apologizes for the poor
  quality of the paper, almost school notebook paper, the kind with the thin
  blue lines.

  My impulse was to 'make a work' from the letter, which had been discarded
  in the book, to use the text in one or another fashion. But the text
  seemed too powerful, too angry, too sad, to do anything with it. I talked
  it over with Azure and our friends. At one point, I was going to throw it
  out; at another, file it away as a reminder of the vastly different worlds
  present in slaughter-america under the bush regime. I finally decided the
  best was to remail the letter in the original envelope to the original
  recipient. Perhaps she had lost it, perhaps it had frightened her so much
  that she subconsciously left it behind when she turned the book in for
  textbook credit. Our friends gave us two stamps and tape, and with the
  envelope resealed, I sent it on its way though a local mailbox.

  On the envelope I wrote, 'found this in a book and thought you may want
  it.' I didn't sign it, the separation was permanent.

  I had an odd sense of loss, which haunts me. I have used found materials
  if they 'resonate' before - for example, webcam images that are then
  transformed, arranged, semantically 'intensified.' But this letter was too
  strong - or if not strong - violent - or if not violent - symptomatic - it
  was too dis/comforting, as if real life permanently intruded on what, in
  my work, in all work, can be at best metaphoric conceits, no matter how we
  think otherwise.

  The letter was uncanny. It demanded, it appeared to demand, to be read,
  absorbed, to fit in, as if returning were a coward's way out - for there
  was no indication that she would have done anything but discarded it,
  perhaps after class. The envelope was thick, immediately evident within
  the pages of the ecology text, surely she would have put it away,
  somewhere, anywhere, if she had wanted to save it. And the undeniable
  violence of it all mitigated against this, I could only imagine that she
  had moved on, that she wanted as much distance as possible from the
  writer, that the letter was a reminder of an uncomfortable past, one which
  could never be absorbed, could never fit in with her current lifestyle.
  The letter was close to illiterate, she was in college, and the text was
  somewhat advanced, with a cdrom illustrating ecological processes, and
  quite clearly often played.

  There is a weakness and pretense in all writing, in all art, as if 'my
  love is like a red, red, rose' said anything at all that rearranged the
  molecular epistemology of things on the planet. Art murmurs presumably to
  the soul, it calls us to action, makes us feel better about the world, or
  gives us an expressivity for the violent tendencies of the times. Or it
  allows us to push the boundaries of comfort, dis/comfort, in new ways, for
  dis/comfort speaks in art of a 'newness' that is non-existent. It takes
  one letter in a book on ecology to contradict each and every other form of
  cultural construction, a letter from a sender who had no idea whatsoever
  that it would form the punctum of an essay, nor, I suspect, would he care.
  He would care about his woman who was no longer his woman, his love who
  had betrayed him, and he would kill the perpetrator of that betrayal who
  surely was not her.

  This short essay can't go anywhere, it can only point to a found object, a
  letter, which could not be subsumed. And within that lack, on my part, is
  an incredible selfishness, that the debris of the world is there, in the
  first place, to be used. To be primordially used. To be used by a writer
  or an artist. To be absorbed, to be robbed of originary content. And while
  that may be the premise and promise of art, it remains a hole in this
  page. Debris is never debris, or it is someone's, or it is no one's, but
  it is never debris, just like there are never vermin or weeds, words which
  I detest for their inherent elitism. Debris is nothing but the world, and
  it is the world which rends and renders artwork useless, meaningless, at
  best with meaning grafted by the reader who has no choice.

The pictures don't do them justice. A boojum forest is like riding through
a landscape by Dr. Seuss. The Baja California boojum region is something
like 200 miles long.

Dear Friends --


I am thankful to everyone who responded.  I will gladly take a bullet
for our poetry, and I will wear my scar proudly.

So far as Snow White and her seven mental dwarfs go, what they cannot
accept is this:  More people are writing poetry (and other creative
writings) today because of Language and post-avant than for any other
reason.  I think the influence is comparable to that of the Beats, and
like that of the Beats, there are succeeding generations.  If you
really love creativity, how can this be bad?  You gotta give credit
where credit is due!  Snow White and her dwarfs ought to channel their
resentment into writing a better poem, one that appeals to the spirit
of the times the way that Language and the post-avant and the
postmodern have.  You just gotta give credit where credit is due. . . .


(And I do not believe that people who use the term "postmodern" are not
postmodern -- say, in their poetry and in the way they think.  I do,
however, believe that it is a broad category.  And where concerns
poetry, it is more than a matter of form or style or technique, it is a
sensibilities.  Agree or disagree -- I have friends who do both -- it's
really not that big a deal for me.  The term does not offend or
threaten or challenge me -- or my self-image -- in any way.  And I
think it is ridiculous to dismiss a person because of his vocabulary.
Not all of us seek legitimacy by way of association -- I suppose it's a
self-image thing, or maybe it's a career thing.  I suppose it's a
"value" thing.)


I'll be reading you all wherever I find you.

ERATIO SMEARED


This "review" just up at Web Del Sol, by Tim McGrath: mcgrattf@bc.edu :


"Eratio Postmodern Poetry =A0 ://=A0 View | Rating:
Eratio offers up incomprehensible postmodern fodder for critics of
postmodern incomprehensibility. Good luck finding anything
intentionally; look for links and find a blog, look for poetry and find
quotations. And when you realize that Eratio's editor, Gregory Vincent
St. Thomasino (whose name suggests either a pseudonymously guarded
narcissist or the tragi-comic hero of a Wes Anderson film) has included
his own embarrassing asseverations ("Discourse is like a river" is his
unqualified and deplorably facile, but apparently quotable, simile)
along with the words of Nietszche, Plato, and Jung, you'll start
wondering whether this postmodern experiment is, in fact, a postmodern
parody. On the same page, alongside the luminous Lord Duke G.V. St.
Thomasino, Diane Wakoski is quoted as saying, "I feel that poetry is
the completely personal expression of someone about his feelings and
reactions to the world. I think it is only interesting in proportion to
how interesting the person who writes it is." By Wakoski's logic, the
people who bring you Eratio are not very interesting at all."


.

Friends, as contributors to eratio postmodern poetry, you should
proudly count yourselves among some of the most talented and
influential writers and artists on the scene today. As editor of the
site, I can honestly say that many of the works submitted for eratio
simply do not make the cut (and I'm sorry if I've rejected your work,
Mr. McGrath, but there's always the welcome to send again).=A0 I try to
be fair when making these judgments, because I know what it means to
put your heart into something (especially something like poetry), and
how it feels to be rejected.

Eratio is a labor of love, since it generates no revenue for me (but
rather costs me time and energy and money). Each issue requires months
of work, involving coding, design, correspondence, planning, and an
immeasurable amount of frustration. Ultimately, it's very gratifying --
but I cannot say it's fun.

Still, I am proud to publish your work and hope that its presence at
eratio gives you some exposure and some degree of satisfaction that you
otherwise would not have had, and gives you some encouragement to
continue being a poet in an economy that doesn't much care about you.

I do not know Tim McGrath. But if you read him closely you'll see that
this is nothing more than a personal attack on me (based on his dislike
of my name!). I am distressed because none of the poetry or artworks
are mentioned, and in fact I do not believe Mr. McGrath even bothered
to read or look at any of it. (But can he, indeed, talk about the
poetry, or the content of the page, or the logic of the concept, I
wonder? Why the subterfuge of fixating on my name? No one of any real
insight or wit would do that -- unless he were inclined to burlesque.)

As a poet and a critic, I take great care to explicate my reasons for
"liking" or "disliking" something. More importantly, I consider it my
responsibility to try to place a work into context, to appreciate what
it is the poet is trying to achieve, and to assess whether this has
been accomplished (and sometimes I offer alternatives, but I never
ridicule and I am never disrespectful, and I always manage to point out
a poet's successes). There are several reviews in the current issue
that I took great care in writing, I hope you'll see them for yourself
now that the issue is up.

Reading Tim McGrath's personal attack (on my name, for Pete's sake!) is
an example of something a poet or a critic should never do. Mr. McGrath
has latched on to my name as something that irritates him a great deal,
and in the process has ignored your work and mine. Why does Mr. McGrath
dislike me personally? Could it be that this is payback? (Or else:
What's "pseudonymously guarded" about it? What's "narcissist" about it?
I will, however, accept that being a Roman Catholic name it is somewhat
"tragi-comic.")

Mr. McGrath's tone -- glib, cynical, condescending, and uninformed and
lacking of the requisite vocabulary to comprehend let alone explicate
or set a value upon "the postmodern" -- is indicative not only of Web
Del Sol but of the "unlettered lad" generally. I do not know why Web
Del Sol has adopted this attack mentality toward anything to do with
"the postmodern," but for sure it is the creativity of resentment.

Subject:      More on the topic in a different light
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Trying to think through the Brown quote (given in my posting under the su=
bject
"The topic in a different light") in case anyone's still interested:

When Brown talks about "linguistic analysts [who] have had the project of=

getting rid of the disease in language by reducing language to purely
operational terms," I think he's referring to theories of language which
insist that language has no meaning except what it's given by its context=
=2E  In
this view, language is "purely" operational because it is atelic:  it ope=
rates
without operating to any end; it works without working *for* anything; it=

means without meaning anything in particular.  Obviously this view is, or=
 at
least is close to, the view of language which has subsequently become
popularly known as structuralist or post-structuralist.  A poetics based =
on
such a view -- what I called a Witttgensteinian poetics -- will see the r=
ole
of poetry as being to liberate language from the delusory quality that
Wittgenstein attributed to it, in order to ... what?

In order to do nothing.  And this is the problem.  The purpose of liberat=
ing
language should be to enable the poet to use it to reveal meanings which =
can't
be revealed if language remains bound to what we deludedly call reality, =
if
the words remain locked in their nominalist prison.  It's dream-work.  Ju=
st as
the psyche's dream-worker can only construct symbolic meaning by liberati=
ng
sensory images from their quotidian meaning, so the poet can only constru=
ct
meaning in a language which has been liberated from the delusion that it
represents our experience.  Or to put it another way, words must be liber=
ated
from their ordinary meanings before the poet is able to use them to const=
ruct
metaphors, and metaphor, as Aristotle said, is the essence of poetic geni=
us. =

There are indeed times when a cigar is only a cigar, but the dream time,
whether of the psychic dream worker, the shaman, or the poet, =

isn't one of them.

The result of a poetics that stops with Wittgenstein instead of beginning=
 with
him will be a poetry that offers nothing but a savor of the meaninglessne=
ss of
the universe:  it will be a poetry that turns the world into a kalaidesco=
pe
which it invites us to delight in passively like a baby reclining under a=

fascinating jangling and shining crib toy.

And from a psychoanalytic standpoint the profoundly infantile nature of s=
uch a
poetry cannot of course be accidental.  Reversion to infantile passivity =
is
the classic simple hysterical response to prolonged unbearable threat. Th=
e
constructors of such a poetry are acting as artists in spite of themselve=
s,
imitating the action of the human self in a world which has made it impos=
sible
to live a human life.  The unconscious message of such poetry is, "Please=

don't hurt me."

Hi Jon,

I don't have much to comment here, I simply agree with you.

Even if that "Please don't hurt me" can be saved, it could be a good
initial step towards civilized manners.

Take care,
Anny

Watching the Detective Watching the Detective
http://eyesoflaura.org

"The conceit is half Blair Witch Project, half Paul Auster; 'Laura,' an
artist working as guard at the Vancouver Art Gallery, makes art out of
allowing visitors to her website to take charge of the museum's cameras and
see what she sees. 'Sometimes I wonder whether more happens because I'm
watching or whether events line themselves up for my benefit or something,'
she reflects in her first diary entry on the site, dated September 1, 2004.
Every few days, something new is posted, including video clips from the
day's observations. These have slowly coalesced into a mystery of sorts, as
the narrator obsesses over the interactions of the milieu's recurring
characters--a detective, a skateboarder, and an odd woman. True to that
initial entry's promise, as you watch the narrator piece together the clues,
you can never be sure whether something is 'really' going on, or whether
it's in her head. Nevertheless, all the references to Blow-up, The
Conversation and other fictions in which the observer becomes the observed
make one guess that Laura's job is about to become even more interesting. .

Jessica Torres is a Nuyorican coming to you by way of the Bronx--
Riverdale, but the Bronx nonetheless. An organizer of the Acentos Poetry
Series and a member of the louderARTS Project, she is obsessed with her
journals and makes believe the world understands her overall paranoia.
A teaching artist and advisor in Bronx high schools with ASPIRA of New
York, Inc., she hopes for a book but knows getting published won't
validate her as a writer. Her primary influences are el Reverendo Pedro
Pietri, Mart=EDn Espada, Nicanor Parra, Langston Hughes, Julia de =
Burgos,
among other contemporary poets she's come across.
She has been a featured poet/performer at Bar13, SOUL NATION at
Bluestocking Bookstore, The Point, Hunter College, Amherst College,

Ascencion showcase at the Chashama Art Space.
Poetry found her like sun in her eyes, spawning an inseparable love/hate
relationship between them. She is slowly recovering.
Her work can be found in her first chapbook, Seven by Seven.

    Grave Failures

I climbed a Boojum once to see
if from up there I would be free
to become more than dad told me
I would amount to writing poetry...

The man insisted I become
someone solid
not a pauper or a literary bum
he harped
he nagged
he ragged on me till I felt numb
and then
you see I crushed his dreams
of my success
by majoring to his distress=20
in liberal arts, "Oh woe is me!"
He cried

I climbed a Boojum when he died
wishing he were at my side...

where's the oatmeal
response?

(By the way, one of the reasons for not being at AWP really was a
serious situation due to importing grains, specifically a bag of oats.
It was nebraska and we had a 100 pound bag and this last time they only
allowed 50lbs after years of this practice. When you are not allowed
back into the states from Canada due to oats for oatmeal I think it is
our President's fault. )

Subject:      Jon Corelis - Can Poetry Liberate Language?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Jon, I'm extremely interested in this. Philosophical poetry and prose is
largely divided into two camps. Those who hope for this liberation and who have
a general idea of to what - and - those who don't, but who nevertheless use
language to make their point that there is no point to language. Mary  Jo
===================

Trying to think through the Brown quote (given in my posting under the
subject
"The topic in a different light") in case anyone's still  interested:
When Brown talks about "linguistic analysts [who] have had the project of
getting rid of the disease in language by reducing language to purely
operational terms," I think he's referring to theories of language which insist  that
language has no meaning except what it's given by its context.  In  this view,
language is "purely" operational because it is atelic:  it  operates
without operating to any end; it works without working *for*  anything; it
means without meaning anything in particular.  Obviously this  view is, or at
least is close to, the view of language which has subsequently  become popularly
known as structuralist or post-structuralist.  A poetics  based on such a
view -- what I called a Witttgensteinian poetics -- will see the  role of poetry
as being to liberate language from the delusory quality  that
Wittgenstein attributed to it, in order to ... what?

In order to  do nothing.  And this is the problem.  The purpose of  liberating
language should be to enable the poet to use it to reveal meanings  which
can't
be revealed if language remains bound to what we deludedly call  reality, if
the words remain locked in their nominalist prison.  It's  dream-work.  Just
as
the psyche's dream-worker can only construct  symbolic meaning by liberating
sensory images from their quotidian meaning,  so the poet can only construct
meaning in a language which has been liberated  from the delusion that it
represents our experience.  Or to put it  another way, words must be liberated
from their ordinary meanings before the  poet is able to use them to construct
metaphors, and metaphor, as Aristotle  said, is the essence of poetic genius.

There are indeed times when a cigar is only a cigar, but the dream  time,
whether of the psychic dream worker, the shaman, or the poet,
isn't  one of them.
The result of a poetics that stops with Wittgenstein instead of beginning
with
him will be a poetry that offers nothing but a savor of the  meaninglessness
of
the universe:  it will be a poetry that turns the  world into a kalaidescope
which it invites us to delight in passively like a  baby reclining under a
fascinating jangling and shining crib toy.

And from a psychoanalytic standpoint the profoundly infantile nature of  such
a
poetry cannot of course be accidental.  Reversion to infantile  passivity is
the classic simple hysterical response to prolonged unbearable  threat. The
constructors of such a poetry are acting as artists in spite of  themselves,
imitating the action of the human self in a world which has made  it
impossible
to live a human life.  The unconscious message of such  poetry is, "Please
don't hurt  me."

I offered the Norman O. Brown quote here because I thought it has a  striking
and specific relevance to contemporary poetics.  Brown wrote  that some
"linguistic analysts have had the project of getting rid of the  disease in
language by reducing language to purely operational terms."   It seems to me
that some contemporary American poets have engaged in a  similar project to
create a poetry which uses language purely operationally,  and for the same
reason:  as part of what Wittgenstein called  philosophy's "battle against the
bewitchment [Verhexung] of our intelligence  by means of language."

I think that this project, as Brown also says of  the project of the
linguistic
analysts he mentioned, will fail because it is  impossible, and anyway would
be
pointless if it succeeded.  As Brown  says, "a purely operational language
would be a language without a libidinal (erotic) component; and
psychoanalysis
would suggest that such a project is impossible because  language, like man,
has an erotic base, and also useless because man cannot  be persuaded to
operate (work) for operation's sake."  For "language" in  the foregoing
sentence substitute "poetry," and you can take it as a critique  of certain
current avant-garde poetics.
Poetry, like psychoanalysis, should begin where Wittgenstein ends.   A
Wittgensteinian poetics will result only in an aridly endless restatement  of
the problem, but what the poet must provide is a solution.

========================
If, in the history of every child, language is first of all a mode of  erotic
expression and then later succumbs to the domination of the
reality-principle,
it follows, or perhaps we should say mirrors, the path  taken by the human
psyche and must share the ultimate fate of the human  psyche, namely neurosis
...  To regard human speech, the self-evident  sign of our superiority over
animals, as a disease, or at least as  essentially diseased, is for common
sense ... a monstrous hypothesis.  Yet  psychoanalysis, which insists on the
necessary connection between cultural  achievement and neurosis and between
social organization and neurosis, and  which therefore defines man as the
neurotic animal, can hardly take any other  position. ... if psychoanalysis is
carried to the logical conclusion that  language is neurotic, it can join
hands
with the twentieth century school of  linguistic analysis -- a depth analysis
of language -- inspired by that man  with a real genius for the
psychopathology
of language, Wittgenstein.   He said, "Philosophy is a battle against the
bewitchment [Verhexung] of our  intelligence by means of language."
Some of these linguistic analysts have had the project of getting rid of  the
disease in language by reducing language to purely operational  terms.  From
the psychoanalytic point of view, a purely operational  language would be a
language without a libidinal (erotic) component; and  psychoanalysis would
suggest that such a project is impossible because  language, like man, has an
erotic base, and also useless because man cannot  be persuaded to operate
(work) for operation's sake.  Wittgenstein, if I  understand him correctly,
has
a position much closer to that of  psychoanalysis; he limits the task of
philosophy to that of recognizing the  inevitable insanity of language.  "My
aim is," he says, "to teach you to  pass from a piece of disguised nonsense to
something that is patent  nonsense."  "He who understands me finally
recognizes
[my propositions]  as senseless."  Psychoanalysis begins where Wittgenstein
ends.  The  problem is not the disease of language, but the disease called
man.

ABC radio recently ran a poll for the 100 most popular pieces of piano
music - "the one piece of piano music you can't live without?" I'm
proud to say that my campaign to get John Cage's 4'33" on the list was
a success (it is the only piece which I literally can't live without -
as long as I'm alive, I'll hear ambient sound, but I could choose not
to listen to a Beethoven sonata). Made it to number 40! Next campaign
is getting Stockhausen videos played on MTV (could be more
challenging). Most of the winners were the predictable classical names,
though I was impressed to see "Chopsticks" at no. 7

The pictures don't do them justice. A boojum forest is like riding through

I had Dick Bridgman for a tutorial on Melville back when he was in the
midst of writing Gertrude Stein in pieces. He was a very supportive
teacher & certainly was the only person I knew on the faculty at
Berkeley at that point (I met Grenier a bit later) who thought that
reading Melville & reading Stein made perfect sense together. We used
to have great chats on that very topic,

Richard Bridgman -- retired UC Berkeley professor, author
- Charles Burress, Chronicle Staff Writer
Monday, February 14, 2005

Richard Bridgman, a retired UC Berkeley English professor who covered
the Toledo Mud Hens as a sportswriter, went to sea on an oil tanker
and reshaped the reputations of Gertrude Stein and Henry David
Thoreau, has died at age 77.

Professor Bridgman died Jan. 27 at his Berkeley home after a short
battle with cancer.

Born in Toledo, Ohio, he fled his home state as soon as he graduated
from high school and joined the Navy near the end of World War II.
After a stint with the merchant marine on an oil tanker, he took off
for the life of an expatriate in France. He returned to Ohio for a
short reporting career at a Toledo newspaper and also worked for TWA
in New York, his family said.

He studied for a year at Stanford (1947-48), and later resumed his
college education under the distinguished historian and English
professor, Henry Nash Smith, at Berkeley, where he earned three
degrees in English: a bachelor's in 1956, a master's in 1957 and a
Ph.D. in 1960.

After teaching at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire for two years, he
returned to Berkeley as an assistant professor in 1962 and won tenure
four years later.

He wrote influential works on Stein, Thoreau, Mark Twain and
colloquial American English, among other topics.

"They're very important books," said his Berkeley colleague of four
decades, emeritus English Professor Morton Paley. "He was recognized
as a really great Americanist."

Professor Bridgman's "Gertrude Stein in Pieces," published in 1970, is
regarded as a classic and helped relocate the reputation of Stein from
the periphery of American letters to her being regarded as "a central
figure of the American expatriate movement," Paley said.

Professor Bridgman's interest in Stein, who lived for a time in Paris,
was probably fueled by his own youthful adventure living among
American expats in France, said his son, Roy Bridgman.

In "Dark Thoreau" (1982), Professor Bridgman recast the dreamy
transcendentalist of Walden Pond as a "a literary psychopath," to
borrow the hyperbolic description of Bridgman's Thoreau from another
Thoreau scholar, the late Carl Bode.

His other influential books include "The Colloquial Style in America"
in 1966 and "Traveling in Mark Twain" in 1987. He had been working on
a book about the writings of George Washington, but that project was
aborted after his manuscripts and research were destroyed in the
Oakland-Berkeley hills fire in 1991.

During the Cold War in 1974, when American professors were rare in
Russia, he became the first American to hold a newly established
visiting chair at that nation's most prestigious center of higher
learning, Moscow State University.

Upon his retirement in 1989, he was awarded one of the campus' highest
honors, the Berkeley Citation.

He won praise not only for his scholarship but also for his
contributions to the university. Possessing a marked sense of ethics,
he was called "the good conscience of us all" by one colleague and was
elected by his peers to the English department's Advisory Committee
more frequently during his tenure than anyone else.

He also served as the chair of the Mark Twain Project at the Bancroft
Library in the 1970s and played a leading role on the faculty
committee on campus libraries.

He is survived by his sons Roy of Sonora and Joel of Berkeley; his
daughter Cynthia Josayma of Berkeley; and two grandchildren.

A memorial gathering will be held 4 p.m. Thursday at the Faculty Club
on the Berkeley campus.

Good point.  Here's the original score here:

http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/4-33/

But I think as a rule, the classic performances of it have all been at
a piano.  I saw Ellsworth Snyder perform it in Madison in the 80s
sitting at a baby grand.

length in half. This is what it takes to start creating a streamlined short
story, usually referred to as a "short short." But is a short short simply
determined by the number of words used? Is it an abbreviated character
study? Does it even have plot development to speak of? To answer these
questions, we will look at contemporary American writers excelling in very
short stories, such as Diane Williams and Gary Lutz, as well as Modernists
who experimented with the form. We will also attempt our own short shorts
and brave the intriguing hazzards of paring fiction down to 100 words (or
less!).

Barry Crimmins
Benefit Performance and Booksigning: Never Shake Hands with a War Criminal
Thursday, February 17, at 7 pm.
Talking Leaves, Main St.

Never Shake Hands with a War Criminal weaves personal and political history
into a heartfelt memoir of cutting humor and biting satire. In the
straightforward manner of his heroes, Mark Twain and Will Rogers, Crimmins
tells the story of his skeptical childhood in the frozen wastes of upstate
New York (Skaneateles), his upbringing by a hard-line war veteran father and
leftist mother, and his rambling life that led to Boston and the
revitalization of American stand-up comedy (he founded two of Boston's
fabled comedy clubs in the 1980's). Along the way he leaves no heartless
reactionary crook unpummeled and no brave soul unrecognized. Ranging across
the last twenty years of our trial by government and corporate kleptocracy,
this unreformed political southpaw reminds us of exactly why and who we are
fighting. Admission: $5 suggested donation will benefit the Buffalo
Coalition for Progressive Media, an advocacy group working on broadening
local media choices by working to bring alternative progressive media
programs like Democracy Now! to our airwaves.

Well it's true that it got its first peformance by a pianist (John
Tilbury?), who I believe marked the beginning and end by raising and
lowering the lid. I think there are other versions scored for other
ensembles.

I was more bothered thinking about which Beethoven sonata not to listen to
during the 4'33" -- none of them would fit, not at normal tempo anyways. But
then again one's perception of time is bent while listening to music; on the
other hand I once saw a contemporary dance piece without music, and was
astonished to find, at the end of what I'd thought was a good 20 minutes at
least, that only 5 minutes had elapsed.

Fascinating,

Is this (what you thought was a least 20 minutes...was five minutes) due to to intense concentration or to boredom? Are they related, but only as pun, or deeper coincidence?

It makes sense for Brown to say the 'logical conclusion' of
'linguistic analysis' is to drain the libidinal component from
language.  But he distinguished the reductionists from
Wittgenstein in the quoted material.  If his stated task was to
analyze linguistic bewitchment (or in Brown's terms: neurosis),
i think you can recognize in (later) Wittgenstein's *method* --
distinct from his goal -- the principle that all remarks [poems]
are provisional, that there's always more to say.  So i don't
know how you 'end' with Wittgenstein. Or how any poets find a
solution rather than multiple solutions that are each
temporarily satisfactory to some people.  Then they get restless
again (that old libido) and do some more work.

I just hate to see my man W (the *good* W) tarred with such a
broad brush!  And that's partly because i think he wrote some
good prose poems, if unwittingly.

PS relevant Brown quote:

"Some of these linguistic analysts have had the project of
getting rid of the disease in language by reducing language to
purely operational terms.  From the psychoanalytic point of
view, a purely operational language would be a language without
a libidinal (erotic) component; and psychoanalysis would suggest
that such a project is impossible because language, like man,
has an erotic base, and also useless because man cannot be
persuaded to operate (work) for operation's sake.
Wittgenstein, if I understand him correctly, has a position much
closer to that of psychoanalysis; ..."

Not only have I read "GEB," I'm currently teaching it.  I remember discovering it
back in junior high school not long after it was first published, and finding it to be
one of those "life-saving" books one reads as a young person.  (Not that it's for
young people only, obviously -- it's a challenging book!  I just mean it's the kind
of book that can bowl you over if you do read it when you're young.)  Now I'm
trying to get my own students stoked about it.  They're doing well with it so far.

It is a terrific book.  Exuberant and unique.

It was the boredom. (chuckles) The rest of the programme was lovely,
including a piece danced to a live gamelan band.

I think it a good time for Cage performances in Baghdad, Beirut - all the
hot spots - including the W House. Four minutes & 33 seconds of silence in
front of a baby grand performed with a full orchestra on the street in front
of the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad - or inside the White House Situation Room
- one suspects, would be monumental. The terror of what one might hear in
comparison to the presence of silence might be the most provocative,
inexpensive act of peace to be instilled on the planet of recent time.

Top of the Top 40, indeed!

Anyone have any words about it? I'd like to talk to some folks about it,

The Nebraska town of Monowi has just Elsie Eiler left. She runs=20
everything, including the library that was her late husband's bequest.
February 11, 2005

By Stephanie Simon, Times Staff Writer

MONOWI, Neb. =97 Weeds twine around the disintegrating remnants of the=20=

water tower and sprout in a tangle through the floorboards of the=20
grandest house in town. The Methodist church, gray with rot, slumps=20
toward the frozen ground. An empty mailbox flaps open on a gravel rut=20
that was once a road.

  The people of Monowi have died or moved =97 all but one: Elsie Eiler.=20=

Brisk and unsentimental at 71, she lives in the one home still fit for=20=

living in, a snug trailer with worn white siding. She runs the one=20
business left in Monowi, a dark, wood-paneled tavern, thick with smoke.

  She also runs the library.

  The sign outside is painted on a section of a refrigerator door. The=20=

floor is bare plywood. There's no heat. But there are thousands upon=20
thousands of books. "The Complete Works of Shakespeare." "Treasure=20
Island." Trixie Belden and "The Happy Valley Mystery." Zane Grey's=20
westerns, every one of them, lined up across two shelves. Homer.=20
Tennyson. Amy Tan. Goethe.

  Elsie's late husband, Rudy, read them endlessly. He farmed and tended=20=

bar, he ran a grain elevator, he delivered gas to filling stations, and=20=

when the town was down to just him and Elsie, he served as mayor too.=20
But he always found time to read =97 science fiction, history, the=20
classics =97 anything but a Harlequin romance.

  When he got sick with cancer two years ago, Rudy confided a dream to=20=

Elsie: He wanted to turn his collection into a public library.

  Rudy ordered a custom-made building and set it a few steps from his=20
home and his tavern. The Eilers' son, Jack, wired the lights, and=20
friends built floor-to-ceiling shelves. But Rudy died in January 2004,=20=

before he could fill them.

  Five months later, his friends and family came together to pack the=20
small white building with Rudy's books. Elsie estimates they shelved at=20=

least 5,000 volumes.

  Monowi, population 1, had its library.

  The farm kids who come tumbling into the tavern with their parents run=20=

up to the library now and again to paw through the magazines, looking=20
for pictures of man-eating snakes. Friends visiting Elsie from the=20
neighborhood =97 any town within 50 miles =97 stop by every few months =
to=20
browse. Rudy's younger brother Jim pulls his pickup to the library door=20=

and carts home stacks at a time.

  Monowi may be the smallest town in the nation with its own library.=20
But the bounty of books here for the taking is very much in the spirit=20=

of rural America.

  Across the Great Plains, towns that have long since lost their=20
schools, their banks and all hope of a future still keep their little=20
libraries going. Volunteers open them for a few hours a week, waiting=20
for readers to come down deserted Main Streets.

  Nearly 30% of the nation's libraries serve communities of fewer than=20=

2,500 people, including almost 3,000 libraries in towns where the=20
population is measured in the hundreds.

  Because they run on volunteer labor, making do with the books at hand,=20=

rural libraries survive even in tight times like these, when big cities=20=

are shutting branches. In California, John Steinbeck's hometown of=20
Salinas (population 150,000) has announced plans to close all of its=20
libraries by April to save money. But it's still possible to check out=20=

a book in Gaylord, Kan. (population 97), and Strang, Neb. (population=20
38).

  In Monowi, Elsie keeps the key to the library hanging in the tavern.=20=

She's there 12 or 14 hours a day, frying up egg sandwiches for the=20
farmers and hunters and construction workers who stop by for lunch at=20
any random hour they're free. "Go on up and take a look," she'll urge.

  Rudy's Library is less than 350 square feet. The books are worn,=20
disorganized and eclectic beyond description.

  It's impossible not to linger.

  Here's "Ivanhoe," by Sir Walter Scott, next to "Jaws 2." Mark Twain's=20=

collected works sit side by side with "Dancer of Dreams" by Patricia=20
Matthews, touted on the cover as "America's First Lady of Love."=20
(That's one of the few Rudy likely never opened.)

  "How to Get Filthy Rich, Even If You're Flat Broke" recommends reading=20=

obituaries so you can assume a dead man's identity to throw creditors=20
off the hunt. "Adventures in Science with Doris and Billy" =97 circa =
1945=20
=97 advises: "If you could fly in an airplane to the moon, you might=20
reach it in about 100 days."

  Copies of Reader's Digest date back to 1950; National Geographic, to=20=

1953. A local newspaper from 1941 bears the front-page news that Rose=20
Karel's tonsillectomy went well.

  The library runs on the honor system: Take what you want, return it=20
when you can.

  "You just have to look around till you find something you want to=20
read," Elsie says. "You'll probably run across something you're not=20
thinking of."

  Seven-year-old Shelby Micanek comes by after school one frosty=20
afternoon, drawn to the children's corner. She has two books at home,=20
she says proudly, both Dick and Jane, one with a yellow cover, one with=20=

a blue.

  In Rudy's Library, she's looking for a book about animals.

  Shelby pulls out a textbook about mammals, flips through it eagerly,=20=

then frowns. Too many words. She wanders down the shelf, picking out=20
books at random. "Look at this big one!" she calls out, wonder in her=20
tone. "This would take a long time to read!" She's holding Webster's=20
Unabridged Dictionary.

  Over in the corner, first-grader Cade Kalkowski is staring at a=20
National Geographic photo of a banana slug, entranced. Then he spots a=20=

hardcover book and drops the banana slug with a shriek. "Killer sharks!=20=

I want this one!" Cade runs back to the tavern to show his dad. Shelby=20=

follows, clutching "Zoo Babies."

  Rudy collected these books over a lifetime in love with the printed=20
word.

  "He always said he never read any book but he didn't learn from it,"=20=

Elsie says.

  Though he had more books than he could finish, Rudy prowled estate=20
sales and thrift shops, always looking for more. When a community four=20=

towns over closed its school, he bought out the whole library =97 two=20
pickup loads of outdated textbooks and teen novels. As Elsie puts it:=20
"He was forever buying something for a little bit of nothing."

  The subject didn't matter to him, as long as it wasn't straight=20
romance. In his last year, he spent hours reading a seed catalog, cover=20=

to cover.

  "Out here in the sticks, we don't have a lot of things to do,"=20
explains Barb Weeder, a friend.

  "So if you find something you like to do, you do a lot of it," Elsie=20=

adds.

  Tavern patrons got used to seeing Rudy's books piled every which way,=20=

under the 50-cent bags of chips or on top of the bar, or over by the=20
collection of beer steins painted with Clydesdale horses. Elsie reads=20
too. She loves historical novels. But in 49? years of marriage, she=20
never could catch up to Rudy.

  He always had two or three books going at once, and if he really liked=20=

one, he'd put it on his list to re-read through the long, still nights=20=

of a prairie winter.

  "He always said you were never locked in one place when you read=20
books. You could be under the ocean or exploring space or shooting=20
cowboys and Indians in the desert," says the Eilers' daughter, Rene=20
Lassise, who was named after a character in one of Rudy's beloved=20
westerns.

  Rudy did most of his exploring through books. He spent three years in=20=

France with the Air Force after high school. Then he and Elsie lived in=20=

Omaha for six months while he finished up his military obligation. But=20=

as soon as they could, the Eilers moved back to Monowi, where they had=20=

met in the one-room schoolhouse on the hill when he was in fourth grade=20=

and she was in third.

  This is rugged territory, a good three-hour drive from Omaha. The=20
folding hills are good for pasture or for growing alfalfa, and not much=20=

else. Even at its peak in the 1930s, Monowi had fewer than 150=20
residents and measured perhaps three blocks by four blocks. When Elsie=20=

and Rudy bought the tavern in 1971, the population was down to 22.

  But community is broadly defined out here.

  It's nothing to drive a half-hour or more to drop in on a neighbor.=20
The local FM station keeps everyone up to date on the gossip from two=20
counties: "That big 5-0 birthday bash was well attended, and Mike was=20
definitely surprised=85. "

  And so, even as Monowi withered, even as their two children grew up=20
and moved away, Rudy and Elsie never felt alone.

  Monowi remains an incorporated town because there's no reason to=20
dissolve it. Elsie grants herself her own liquor license, collects=20
taxes from herself =97 "it's a matter of cents, really" =97 and keeps =
the=20
books.

  Every year, Elsie has to approve a municipal road plan to receive=20
Monowi's share of state transportation funds, which she sends to the=20
county to maintain the two-lane highway that runs past her tavern.

  A Notice of Public Hearing is duly posted in the tavern, announcing an=20=

upcoming meeting on the road plan for all citizens of Monowi to voice=20
"support, opposition and/or suggestions." The meeting is to be held "at=20=

the usual place." Elsie figures it won't last long.

  When the state sends her paperwork, "I just sign wherever it needs to=20=

be signed: mayor, secretary, treasurer," Elsie says. "They know I'm the=20=

only one up here."

  On busy days, a few dozen customers will stop by the tavern for a beer=20=

or a T-bone steak or a $3 platter of gizzards. Now and then, a reader=20
will come in.

  Beth Davy drove 12 miles from her home along the Missouri River bluffs=20=

with her daughter and her grandkids last summer. They spent three hours=20=

rummaging through the shelves, finding treasures.

  The other day Davy was back, returning a novel she had borrowed and=20
plucking a new one from the shelf at random, with an air of=20
expectation. " 'Walking Through the Dark,' " she said, reading off the=20=

cover. "Sounds like a mystery." She wrote her name and the title in a=20
notebook up front, to let Elsie know she was taking it home.

  Elsie means to put the books in order one day. But there's a part of=20=

her that likes how they are now, helter-skelter.

  There's a proper library an hour's drive away, in O'Neill, with 28,500=20=

volumes, a computerized card catalog and dozens of magazines laid out=20
alphabetically, from Air & Space to Workbench.

  That's the place to go if you need a book. Rudy's Library is where to=20=

go if you love them.

An excerpt from Perry Link's fascinating review of He Qunglian's book 'How
the Chinese Government Controls the Media'. The below is reproduced without
permission but with respect. It appeared in the February 24, 2005 issue of
The New York Review of Books (pages 38-39) -- http://nybooks.com

**************************

The Internet, which has grown explosively in China, has become the biggest
obstacle to the government's  control of information. In 1997 the country
had about 620,000 Internet  users; today there are about 80 million, whether
they use home computiers or frequent the "Internet cafés" on the streets.
E-mail--flexible, fast, and unorganized--is the most frustrating medium the
Party has ever confronted.

But if the problem has been large for Chinese officials, so are their
efforts to control it. In 1996 the government started issuing proclamations
forbidding the use of the Internet to circulate information objectionable to
the regime, but it soon realized that this was futile. He Qinglian describes
how, beginning in 1998, the Ministry of State Security recruited a great
many young university graduates with high-tech skills to monitor and control
the Internet. Today there are thousands of them surfing the Web in search of
anti-Party opinions. Anmesty International has estimated that there are some
30,000 but no one outside the system knows for sure. When they find
something they want to suppress they have a number of choices. If the
offending Web site is foreign, they can block it, either temporarily or
permanently, and sometimes can edit it electronically. If the Web site is
domestic, they can issue a warning or they can close it down, a practice
more common during "sevsitive periods" like the run-up to a Party congress
or to an anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. In early 2003, during
the SARS cover-up, forty-two of Google's one hundred most frequently visited
sites were blocked in China.

If electronic methods fail, the police can be sent to deal with the
offending blogger. Then the sanctions become essentially the same as for
work in print: "rectifications," fines, confiscation of money and equipment,
closings, and in extreme cases, arrests.  Of sixty-nine people throughout
the world listed by Reporters Without Borders as in jail for using the
Internet, sixty one are in China, where most of them have been charged with
"subversion" and given sentences ranging from two to twelve years. Four
Internet offenders, all from Falun Gong, have died in prison.

And yet even these measures have not been enough to control the Web.
Electronic cat-and-mouse games continue between bloggers and the regime. In
recent months the government has added psychological weapons to its offense
in an effort to induce Web users to srart policing one another and, by
generating fear, to make people censor themselves.

In Auguest 2002 new regulations required that Web publishers in China have
organizations, bylaws, and an editorial system in which they assign a
"responsible editor" to supervise each article they publish. In form these
rules only bring Web publishers into line with print and other publishers.
But the real intent was to ban personal Web sites. Now at least two people,
and usually more, must be collectively accountable for what any one of them
does on the Internet, and hence each has an incentive to watch the others
and prevent their mistakes. Similar techniques of enforcing collective
responsibility have ancient roots in China, and were much used during the
Mao years.

Moreover, Web sites are being held responsible not only for their own
postings but those of all chat room visitors; managers are therefore obliged
to stand in for the government, monitoring and censoring what gets posted.
Managers of Internet cafés can be punished if any of their customers sends
or receives illicit messages. During the "sensitive periods," cafés and Web
sites thus ask their visitors to be careful, to "please cooperate," and so
on. He Qinglian points out that this system tends to encourage a perverse
assumption in the minds of all concerned, namely, that if someone does "make
a mistake" and precipitate a shutdown, the calamity is the fault of that
person, not the government.

In early 2004 the government set up a new chinese Center for Informing on
Illegal and Harmful Information, which hugely expanded the possibilities for
anyone, anywhere, to report bad thinking to the Chinese police by sending an
email to jubao@china.org.cn ( net.china.cn/chinese/index.htm ). "Jubao"
means "informing". If you want to attack your enemies, however, it is
illegal to do so anonymously. Another recent rule for the Chinese Web says
that surfers must use their real names, a requirement that naturally
strengthens the Web user's "self-discipline".  In March 2003 the government
asked Internet service providers in China to sign on voluntarily to a
"Public Pledge of Self-Discipline for the China Internet Industry". About
three hundred providers, Yahoo among them, did so.

In her conclusion He Qinglian touches on the most sensitive question of all
when she analyzes the term "state security," which is used by the regime to
justify its efforts to block news from reaching the public. The regime also
claims that popular elections above the village level will not work because
the suzhi (quality, character) of the people is too low. The masses are
ignorant, and would be too easily swayed by passion or bias. Therefore, they
coninue, we, the masters of the regime, have to be in control. The logic is
not only humiliating to the Chinese people but oddly circular: we must, the
regime says, run things in our own repressive way because the people are
ignorant, and the people are ignorant in large part because we keep them
from being informed. The result is described as "stability". But the lesson
of He Qinglian's book is that it is the security of the dictatorial system
itself that is at stake.

The English Lesson by Halvard Johnson in a limited edition
of signed, numbered copies is now available from

    Unicorn Press, Inc.
    201 North Coulter Drive
    Bryan, Texas 77803

The price is $12.95 US (including shipping).

"The English Lesson" would be an anthropologist's delight
and a reader's feast even without Halvard Johnson's remarkable
ear. But its music, the composer's attention both global and
local, charges the poem with a story more visceral than its found
source can account for:

        I am very glad
        It gives me pleasure
        It give me great joy.

Considering the praise John Cage has received on this List, I'm surprised
that some are so short-sighted as to insult our beloved and inspiring leader
in his most innovative moments. Cleary, this statement transcends its
surface appearance of incoherence. Bush, in point of fact, is furthering
Cage's work by creating constructs that can only be described as
"spontaneous linguistic indeterminacy."

I know you will all want to calculate the impact of the social security

WOMAN IN AUDIENCE: I don't really understand. How is it the new [Social
Security] plan is going to fix that problem?

GEORGE W. BUSH: "Because the -- all which is on the table begins to address
the big cost drivers. For example, how benefits are calculated, for example,
is on the table. Whether or not benefits rise based upon wage increases or
price increases. There's a series of parts of the formula that are being
considered. And when you couple that, those different cost drivers,
affecting those -- changing those with personal accounts, the idea is to get
what has been promised more likely to be -- or closer delivered to what has
been promised. Does that make any sense to you? It's kind of muddled. Look,
there's a series of things that cause the -- like, for example, benefits are
calculated based upon the increase of wages, as opposed to the increase of
prices. Some have suggested that we calculate -- the benefits will rise
based upon inflation, as opposed to wage increases. There is a reform that
would help solve the red if that were put into effect. In other words, how
fast benefits grow, how fast the promised benefits grow, if those -- if that
growth is affected, it will help on the red."

Back to the Future: Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music at NYU

Revisits Landmark Hip Hop Album
Rapper Chuck D and members of Public Enemy join film director Brett
Ratner and a host of critics, producers, engineers and executives for
seminar exploring The Making of Public Enemy's "It Takes A Nation Of
Millions To Hold Us Back"




On Friday, February 25 and Saturday, February 26 a two-day seminar at
New York University (NYU) will examine the making of what music critics
and hip hop aficionados widely regard as one of hip hop's seminal
albums, Public Enemy's It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.
The 1988 Def Jam recording was a critical and commercial success,
spinning off the controversial singles "Don't Believe the Hype" and
"Bring The Noise."  The album made stars of MCs Chuck D and Flava Flav
and ushered in an era of political rap often referred to as the "golden
age" of the genre.  The seminar, sponsored by NYU's Clive Davis
Department of Recorded Music, will feature a documentary film of Public
Enemy's 1988 and 2002 tours of Great Britain as well as panel
discussions on the making of the album and the political climate that
inspired the artists.  All events will be held at NYU's Tischman
Auditorium (40 Washington Square South between McDougal and Sullivan)
and are free and open to the public.



"Nation of Millions was one of the most important albums of its time.
The lyrics were hard-hitting and confrontational and the music was
visionary. It captures an era in which a certain type of politics was
possible," says Jason King, organizer of the event and associate chair
of the Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music.  "This seminar will be
the first time that many of the players -- the producers, engineers, the
artists -- have been together since 1988.  We'll explore their memories
of the making of the music and find out what's happened to them.
They've all gone on to big things."



On Friday, February 25, the seminar gets underway at 6:00 p.m. with the
film screening, "Public Enemy: London Calling."  The documentary film,
directed by Lathan Hodge, is a work-in-progress that follows Public
Enemy's British tour and features never-before-seen footage of the
group's performances.  That same evening, beginning at 7:45, a panel of
top journalists and critics who covered the era will discuss the music
legacy of Public Enemy and It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us
Back.  Participants include Robert Christgau, Nelson George, Vivien
Goldman, John Leland, Alan Light and Jon Caramanica.



On Saturday, February 26 at noon, the first panel of the day will
feature members of the Def Jam and Rush Arts teams -- the creative staff
behind the album's A&R, publicity, management and marketing.
Participants include film director Brett Ratner (Rush Hour) -- who got
his start directing Public Enemy's first video, "Louder Than a Bomb" --
as well as Bill Adler, Lisa Cortes, Charlotte Hunter, Biff Warren, Kelly
Haley and others.  The day continues with "On Hip Hop and Political
Activism: A Conversation with photographer Glen E. Friedman and author
and activist Jeff Chang" (1:45 p.m.).  Friedman, the author of Fuck You
Heroes and The Idealist, photographed and designed the album's cover.
Chang is the author of the new book Can't Stop Won't Stop: The History
of the Hip Hop Generation.  At 3:30 p.m., the panel "Producing The
Album" will bring together the album's original engineers, the owners of
the Greene Street studio (where the album was cut) and members of the
Bomb Squad production team for the first time since 1988.  Participants
include Rod Hui, Steve Loeb, Nick Sansano, Chris Shaw, Hank Shocklee,
Keith Shocklee and Chairman Mao.



The seminar's final panel, "Revolutionary Voices" (6:00-8:00 p.m.),
features the members of Public Enemy.  Public Enemy frontman Chuck D
joins surprise guests in a reflection on their experiences in the making
of the legendary album.



"Whether you're nostalgic for political music or old school hip hop, or
whether you just want a behind-the-scenes look at how great records are
produced, this is a terrific opportunity," says King.



"The Making of Public Enemy's It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us
Back" is a presentation of NYU's Tisch School of the Arts in association
with African Heritage Month, Shocklee Entertainment and Scratch Magazine
(a leading magazine for hip hop DJs and producers).  All events are held
at Tischman Auditorium on the NYU campus (40 Washington Square South,
between McDougal and Sullivan), and are free and open to the public.
Picture ID will be required to enter the building.  For more information
please contact 212-992-8405.



The Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music officially opened its doors
in September 2003. It is the first program of its kind to offer artistic
training to aspiring record producers and music executives toward a BFA
(Bachelor of Fine Arts) degree in Recorded Music. Students not only
learn to produce records in a state-of-the art recording facility, they
also study the business and craft of music production (A&R, songwriting,
music publishing, radio, film and new media) as well as the history and
culture of popular music.



The program bears the name of its patron and chief advisor to the
program, Clive Davis. Mr. Davis explains his rationale for funding this
program as such: "I've felt for many years that serious, career-minded
students of recorded music should have their own school, just as film
aspirants have had and benefited from for decades."



The Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music is also the first to offer
concentrated courses in R&B and hip hop production (as well as rock and
pop) toward a BFA degree.



The Department of Recorded Music is part of the Tisch School of the
Arts, one of the nation's leading centers of undergraduate and graduate
study in the performing and media arts. The school's alumni consist of
many of the country's leading film directors, Broadway producers and
writers, as well as theater historians and critics.

SF Cinematheque presents
Seen Missing: Two Premieres
Abigail Child In Person

New York poet, essayist and filmmaker Abigail Child documents
how filmmakers' illuminate how our personal movies narrate our
political history. She will join us for a talk and discussion as
well as to screen two of her tapes which recently premiered at
the New York Film Festival.

"The Future is Behind You" retells the story of two sisters
buffeted by the tides of fascism, using personal 16mm archives
of a German Jewish family from the 1930s accompanied by the
music of John Zorn.

"Cake and Steak" mines proud parents' home movie footage to
examine the visual details of 1950s Americans training for a
life in the suburbs.

Child will also contextualize her aesthetic anthropology by
screening Alexander Kluge's "Brutality in Stone: Eternity in
Yesterday" a poetic documentary from 1961 on the architectural
residue of the Third Reich, and showing D.W. Griffith's unedited
camera reels in an elegant deconstruction of his invention of
cinematic narrative before the First World War.

(3) describe the taste of the water using 2 - 8 words
(4) write these words down
(5) send me these words via backchannel email

thanks so much,
all and only my very best,

"TRILOGY"
by Cole Swensen


One


             I


The guard peers closely
at the painting. Count.


The fingers. The figures. The
strange sweep from waist


to chest to head. His hand reaches out
within a second of



             II


She sweeps upward. Up
to where the gold sky might


What would the touch
if it did not first


run up against
a man who is in the end a man



             III


She touched the painting
as soon as the guard


turned his back. Respond.
I said turn around. I


screamed, I drowned, I
thought you were home.


I touched the surface of the canvas.
It was I, the sound of salt. And fell
and is still falling through a silent earth.




Two


             I


A deep red in the sky that has nothing
to do with the season but quiets


Outside drinking coffee and wine and watching.
Look, he's speaking, leaning over to his
neighbor.


Look how the lines around his eyes and mouth.
Fleet. Part. What of that. Replies.



             II


She crosses the square in a bright red coat.
Look how they look at her, look up


from their talking. There is no thought
here of leaving. There is no thought.


There are people crossing the square
arm in arm, in threes and fours and alone in
great numbers.



             III


Joseph Albers, THE INTERACTION OF COLOR,
1975. I've heard
that no one is ever repeated or ever
precisely named.


She took the coat off the peg.
Even to herself, she said it was her own.


She crosses the square on her way home.
She will not stop at a cafe, she will not
talk, she will just go home.




Three


             I


The minute progressions between grey and black
becoming one against the red that stares back.


Because she knows they are watching, she will
not turn around.
Home is a sound repeated to solid, to
something that will hold.


Look, there goes a man with his left hand
left lightly
on the head of his child. There they go.



             II


In the painting, all the reaching hands are
growing.
In the gallery, everything was green and gold
and red


Made the sun, though deep, cut through:
Within the door was a window; within the
window, a jar.


Inside the jar, carefully there, the love
need not be
assigned in order to fix and ignite.



             III


She had to cross the square in order to get home.
She was one. And one by one, they looked up
and watched.


When the guard turned around, the gesture was
gone.
A woman stood back and said no.


She stood back, looking at the painting and
said isn't it fine
that a woman wearing red could arrive at a
gold sky. Remind.
Or else in falling. And nothing broke. The rift
shifts open the devout. A finger that
exceeded number, a
fingertip.

Dear POETICS list,

I'm forwarding this unfortunate news from Mike Henry, co-director of Slam
Planet, a documentary-in-progress. I'll be making a donation to help them
recover some of their material, and I hope you will consider doing the
same.

Brian Clements

Hey everyone,

Hope this finds you well.  As most of you know, for the last year and
a half, I've been serving as Co-Director for Slam Planet: War of the
Words, a feature-length documentary about poetry slam.  Two weeks
ago, a huge fire destroyed our edit suite.

The losses were devastating and we're looking at a long, difficult
road to rebuild our operation and pay specialists to recover media on
our hard drives and tapes which suffered extensive heat, smoke, and
water damage.

I'm sure I don't need to tell you how deeply I believe in Slam
Planet, and the work of the poets in our film.  I'm more dedicated
than ever to making a great movie, but I need your help to shoulder
this enormous financial burden.

Anything you can give will mean the world to me and to the poets in
our film.  Don't think that your few dollars won't make a difference.
 It will.  And most of all, please forward this message to anyone who
you think might be interested.  If you have any questions at all,
please feel free to contact me at mike@slamchannel.com.

The book "the Para Critical Hinge" by nathaniel Mackey  looks interesting
but what is "serial poetics"  - similaryr to "seral music" ? and "diasporic
syncretism"?


 "to the emancipatory potential of collaborative practices; from serial
poetics to diasporic syncretism; "


I suppose all would be revealed with the book itself  but ..just wondering -
idont need such a book (indeed - what do we need?) but it looks
interesting...

I boought abook on long poems by women etc by Lyn Keller (she is very astute
critic and writes well) from  - via ADD ALL - a steo up from my photocopying
the entire book by Jerome McGann (I surrender!! I'll come quietly Ossifer!!)
called The Visible Language of Modernsim which is a facinating book - its
neatly in my folder - but that was a big job copying that -

(Just about feel I should have been paid for doing that....)

But Ive forgotten a lot of it - should have read it when I was young -
things stay in one's mind then...I mean I should have been young when i read
it which is impossible becaue i was..
nearly 50! So I wasnt young , therefore I was old and...well I was older
than when I was young and could remember much more better....

One spin off  -in reading critical works i have sometimes said - that's an
interesting idea  - I'll use that in my poems or a comment by a critic has
inspired a poem etc  - the best critical wods can be re-read a lot.

I suppose this is all a bit "fatuous" or "redundant" ..oh well...thought
Pooh bear..its a funny life under a little cloud that just appearified.

 (Poor old Pooh was always getting muddled -was a "serial" something you
ate - and what were paratrooptters doing in a book? these were some of the
silly ideas Pooh kept thinking of...)

(I am now ~14.4 stone  multiply by 6.35 to kilogrammes)

Method - walk each day and exercisse during the day - also eg halve or
quarter  the amount of potatoes etc in my meals and eat apples and other
fruit etc rather than so much toast - use water crackers instead of toast or
bread or have only one bread intead of two - keep a jar of water in the
fridge rather than use those "sachets (mostly sugar they are) with a bit of
lemon  etc (use milk instead of Yoghurt)  - concentrate my mind on getting
healthy and fit as an interesting project - like a game/hobby -make it a
pleasant challenge and a game....

Dear Friend,

I hope you take a moment to fight the the Right-To-Life Movement
by killing an unborn baby--yours, or perhaps a friend's--this
Valentine's Day.

Show the unborn who's boss this holiday season. After all, it is
your convenience, your wealth and comfort that are important:
not those of an unborn child who knows nothing about life yet.
By keeping the population down, we increase access to the
world's precious resources by people that count (the born)
through a simple, nearly invisible act of slaughter.

Please join NARAL in this important cause. Thank you.

Marianne Moore?
"Raid Kills Bugs Dead"
was a tagline created by Lew Welch,
while, I think, he was a young "copywriter"
in Chicago. Lew's thesis at Reed College
in the early Fifties was on the work of
Gertrude Stein. You can see here
how she provided him with certain resources.
In 1957 or 58 Marianne Moore
created the name "Edsel" for a new model Ford.
Sadly the Edsel was killed dead in the market
by American consumers. "Oversexed" - that
particular vertical oval cavity in the grill -
was considered one of the reasons why.
Once upon a gothic time I created a bumpersticker,
 "Bodyguards Make Better Lovers"
in honor of Patty Hearst and Susan Ford,
both of whom, or Patty, at least, married
one of their bodyguards. Unlike Lew
Welch or Marianne Moore I did not get paid much,
in fact nada. But, at the time, 1976,
it was kind of a comment.

Actually, Moore didn't come up with the name Edsel.  She was invited by Ford to name the new car
but the company decided to name the vehicle after Henry and Clara Ford’s only child, Edsel.

A Letter


I wasn't expecting you to write to me.

I'm a little sad and confused myself.

I'm not very happy when I'm living in limbo.

  Even though it hurt to lose you, it feels better than wondering if you
would ever decide how you felt about me.

  I cut things off because I wanted to move on. When you say that you don't
want to write about how you feel or have been feeling, but you say we need
to communicate, what exactly do you want to communicate?

  What else is there besides how you feel or have been feeling? In the
absence of that, I have to guess how you feel.

  The best guess I came up with was that you just weren't into me all that
much any more.

  And I don't want to waste my time on someone who isn't into me. It hurts
a lot to be with someone who says that maybe he loves me and hints that he
finds me pretty unpleasant.

  When I was with you, I felt like I was a huge disappointment for you.

Now you can be disappointed with someone else.

I guess I'm still angry.

I love you.

  That isn't good enough, though.

  I can't even name what our problems are, so I don't see how those
problems could ever be fixed.

  I have little faith that we can communicate without professional
assistance.

  Are you ready for that?

  Have you been getting therapy for yourself?

  You said you wanted to do that first, so that's more waiting limbo for
me. Anyway, I think you're right.

  Our feelings have never been able to make up for our problems. I'm trying
to solve my own problems now.

  I don't think I can be any good to anyone until I'm good with myself. I
never wanted to lose you either.

  But it would be far worse to lose myself, and I'm the one who needs all
of my spare time and effort right now. I wish it didn't have to be this
way.

  There's this part of me that's trying to figure out the magic thing to
say to make everything work out in the end for us.

  But that's just me trying to manipulate the situation.

  I can't control this or make it work out. You do what you've gotta do.

  I'm doing what I have to do.

  I don't exactly miss you.

  You're heart left me so long ago, I got used to you being gone.

I miss the memory of you from long, long ago, when you were a god to me and
I wanted to be just like you.

  I miss how I felt about myself when I met you.

  I felt pretty and amazing and creative and like I was an extraordinary
being.

  And I thought all of that about you, too.

  Somehow, for both of us, our self-esteem and excitement about being in
the world slowly eroded. Maybe all those good feelings in the beginning
were artificial, or exaggerated. But I'm trying to emerge for real now.
I'm not looking to you to help me feel good about myself, or blaming you
for making me feel bad about myself. I don't know what you're doing, or
how you feel.

  I can't be responsible for that.

So why are you angry with me for cutting you off?

  What would you have me

  I didn't want to talk to you anymore because I didn't want to go
through the agony of hoping it would work out for us. Especially when you
wouldn't even commit to trying. I think I also wanted to prove that I'm not
like      .

  But maybe it's you who's like      .

  Maybe you enjoy the unstable drama of loving someone who doesn't give you
what you want.

I'm getting what I want for myself.

I want things to work out for us somehow, but only on terms that feel right
and healthy.

  I don't know what that would be like, exactly.

This is a long letter.

  Longer than         wants right now.

  He's singing "          " in my face to get my attention. He misses you.

  He asked if you could come over Thursday night.

  I didn't know if it was better to say yes or no.

I know nothing.

Steven, Maria

I did know it was Lew Welch but I was warned
not to talk about that subject any where near what
the word I'm not mentioning that this thread is about.
So I thought that Marianne Moore was a good substitute
because the car she promoted went into that great car lot.
Although I also thought about Elsie Stevens
being on a dime and furthermore about Terry Ryan
from Defiance Ohio who was a prize winning poet
who you probably would not know who wrote like
Ogden Nash and therefore would lose the joke.

Please forgive me but I need to practice civility and hidden meanings
not to enrage a flaming backchannel community and thereby lose
my livelihood due to an errant blogger.

Be well

Book Review of Books Mostly Liked


This is written in a more traditional style, in the hopes of greater
distribution, and readership, and in the hopes it will be of greater use.
I already reviewed Bunt's Islam in the Digital Age for RCCS and will send
that out in the future, when it's published online.

Islam in the Digital Age and a number of other books have given me a
greater interest in the Quran itself. I can highly recommend:

Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation, John
Wansbrough; forward, translations, and expanded notes by Andrew Rippin,
Prometheus, 2004, original edition Oxford 1977. For me, raised with a
greater knowledge of biblical exegesis, the Quran has remained somewhat
impenetrable in terms of hermeneutics. This book goes a long way towards
remedying that; it describes the various tropes and interpretive modes
available in enormous detail. Wansbrough begins with retribution, sign,
exile, and covenant, analyzes the concept of prophethood, indicates how
narratology and textual archaeology tend to fail, presents a wide variety
of exegetic principles, and so forth. The work is both older and difficult
- the original has sections in Arabic, Hebrew, German, Greek, and Latin
(at least) left untranslated, but Rippin's addenda help a great deal. I
feel I can work with this book, move out to a greater understanding of the
scaffolding, if not the interiority, of Islam, and for an atheist, this is
the best I can hope for.

On the other end of the spectrum, which closes the ring through Avicenna
and Averroes, look at Moses Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed, the
translation by Shlomo Pines, with an introductory essay (quite long) by
Leo Strauss, University of Chicago Press, 1963, still in print. Note the
name Leo Strauss - the same beloved of neocons in the US (see the BBC's
Powers of Nightmare). Strauss was an expert in Maimonides, and it is oddly
to Maimonides one might turn for an analysis of current US political
rhetoric rhetorical tendency. For Maimonides writes for the 'perplexed' -
those who are already knowledgeable in Biblical exegesis, but who want to
explore the deeper meaning of the words, especially in light of Arabic and
Greek philosophy. The work is two-tiered, which Strauss' essay, How to
Begin to Study The Guide of the Perplexed, brings out - there is exoteric
and esoteric knowledge, and it is not necessary for everyone to understand
everything in depth. Out of this comes Bush, eventually, without the
grace, the knowledge, the problematized liberalism, that seems to
characterize Strauss' thought. And the Guide is interesting itself; it
begins with a terrific analysis of the attributes of God, and moves on
from there. Most highly recommended. Dover has an earlier translation, but
it's more difficult to read, and without the introduction, of course. (The
translator also has an introduction, The Philosophic Sources of The Guide
of the Perplexed, which indicates the tremendous cross-fertilization among
Arabic, Greek, and Jewish sources at the time.)

My ignorance of Strauss (and of political philosophy in general) led me to
The Rebirth of Classical Political Rationalism, An Introduction to the
Thought of Leo Strauss: Essays and Lectures by Leo Strauss, Selected and
Introduced by Thomas L. Pangle, Chicago 1989, currently in print. Here
you'll find The Spiritual Crisis of Modern Rationalism; "Relativism"; An
Introduction to Heideggerian Existentialism; Exoteric Teaching; The Dialog
between Reason and Revelation; and a number of other essays. The essay on
Heidegger, who Strauss considers a master, is itself a revelation; his
interstitial scholarship reminds me of Jane Gallop. Strauss thought, if
anything, is complex, and this is an excellent introduction. We need to
return to the sources at this point, not of theodicy, but at the least, to
those who struggled with materials that Bush and cohorts, bin Laden and
cohorts, have simplified and bent out of all recognition (the two engaged
in a violent dance of slaughter and retribution etc. etc.).

Strauss leads to Karl Kraus, by virtue of politics and the crisis of
rationalism. I've read Kraus for years, on and off, and he now slides into
the descriptions of the work of Elfriede Jelinek, which I've mentioned
before. I've read three of her four novels in print in English from
Serpent's Tail, and am in the middle of the fourth (Lust, translated
Michael Hulse, 1992). Although I'm probably the last to argue for a
'national literature,' there are moments among Kraus/Jelinek that resonate
strongly. It's Wonderful Wonderful Times, Serpent's Tail, translated
Hulse, 1990, that has given me nightmares and an interiority as if the
writing were inscribed just on the outer edge of a scar among twins, or
what happens in the 50s in Vienna. This is the strongest fiction I have
read in a long long time, and I hesitate to call it fiction; whatever it
is, it is something else along the lines of philosophical psychology
without the cleverness that characterizes so much in what might be
considered a fallen genre. Read it.

Here are three O'Reilly books. The first is:

Google Hacks, Tips & Tools for Smarter Searching, Tara Calishain and Rael
Dornfest, 2005. I've actually found this book indispensable, since I play
with the API, Gmail, and so forth. It's like working a cranium, or a model
of a cranium. This edition is far more useful than the first, since it
covers the wide variety of material coming out of Google labs, as well as
the usual material on the deep syntax of web searches. I'm surprised how
valuable it's been. I have mixed feelings of Google itself - on one hand a
commercial enterprise with over 100,000 computers - but on the other, an
entrance, configured/corrupted into the fabric of knowledge itself. So I
work with it; I could work with any number of other search engines, but
Google is familiar, and does what I want it to. When I try other engines
or access modes, I always return to this one, even with the advertising,
etc. It's stripped down and oddly open, and the book is an excellent guide
to all that it can do.

Second O'Reilly is Internet Annoyances: How to Fix the Most Annoying
Things about Going Online, Preston Gralla, 2005. The format of the book
itself is annoying; computer books at this point seem to divide into
'serious' and therefore straight-forward text/diagrams - and 'home use' -
with over the top production. This follows the latter, and as a result
it's difficult to use, which is a shame because the information is quite
useful. Unlike Google Hacks, the best way to use this book, unfortunately,
is to read straight-through; otherwise you might miss something, and there
are things to miss. This is for the non-geek net user, but I did find good
material on software for connection speeds. Gralla himself is excellent.

The third of these - O'Reilly send them to me for review - I ask them - if
the book looks promising or useful or valuable for cultural production of
any sort - since I've very little money - I was a consultant on one of the
Running Linux editions - that started it - is Home Hacking Projects for
Geeks, Tony Northrup and Eric Faulkner, also 2005. So this summer I have a
residency at the Grand Central Art Center in Santa Ana, and want to work
more with hardware, and will be using this and the other books I mentioned
in other reviews that deal with wiring and wireless and automation. This
may be the best of the group, with clear text, etc. Some of the projects
require hardware modification and some don't. A lot involve viewing - home
theater, 'Watch Your House Across the Network,' tivo-ing a radio,
monitoring a pet, etc., and the scripts, many for linux, will be useful
enough. I yearn for the day when creating an installation will be simply a
matter of linking components like modules or subroutines or old analog
audio synthesizers. It's getting there, and books like these are guides
along the way.

I found a copy of Frank Lloyd Wright's Drawings and Plans of Frank Lloyd
Wright, The Early Period (1893-1909), a Dover reissue of an original
German edition from Berlin 1910. This was a real surprise; here's either
convergence or an incredible familiarity with Japanese Heian architecture;
in any case the buildings are spread horizontally with negative spaces and
all sorts of eave-ings that sink the structures into the plains. I thought
I knew Wright - wrong! - and if you have a chance to find this, check it
out. For some reason it was at a Barnes & Noble on sale for fifty cents
(new).

Also by Dover, in the same sale, Introduction to Space Dynamics, William
Tyrrell Thomson, from the first edition Wiley, 1963. I realize how little
I understand the dynamics of space-flight, and this book explains it in
detail. The mathematics is difficult; I get the 'general idea,' and that's
enough at the moment. There's a lot of material on gyroscopic dynamics,
torque of all sorts, etc. If this book were current, it would be
accompanied by a cdrom with all sorts of demonstrations. Still, it's fun
as it is, and certainly if you 'know math,' check it out.

Finally, the Pilgrims had chronicles, and I didn't know that, and found a
book, Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers, published by Dent/Dutton 1910,
introduction by John Masefield of all people. The chapters are New
England's Memorial; Supplement to New England's Memorial; Cushman's
Discourse; New England's Trials; Winslow's Relation; and Winslow's Brief
Narrative and the material is fascinating. I've been reading these sorts
of things, if sorts they are, for several years, after I found that
Letters From an American Farmer (Crevecoeur) contained early material on
Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania, where I was born. There were bitter and violent
wars there and hunger and fury and fear and slaughter and it was in the
middle of the north-east of the state and for the narrative, imminent. So
the Pilgrim material is equally of interest, at least a century earlier;
there is much on Native Americans that I hadn't seen. If you can find this
or similar, read away; it's as astonishing as Hakluyt.

Finally - is anyone out there working with ELF radio? I'm interested in
working with one. -

  A Letter


  I wasn't expecting you to write to me.

  I'm a little sad and confused myself.

  I'm not very happy when I'm living in limbo.

    Even though it hurt to lose you, it feels better than wondering if =
you
  would ever decide how you felt about me.

    I cut things off because I wanted to move on. When you say that you =
don't
  want to write about how you feel or have been feeling, but you say we =
need
  to communicate, what exactly do you want to communicate?

    What else is there besides how you feel or have been feeling? In the
  absence of that, I have to guess how you feel.

    The best guess I came up with was that you just weren't into me all =
that
  much any more.

    And I don't want to waste my time on someone who isn't into me. It =
hurts
  a lot to be with someone who says that maybe he loves me and hints =
that he
  finds me pretty unpleasant.

    When I was with you, I felt like I was a huge disappointment for =
you.

  Now you can be disappointed with someone else.

  I guess I'm still angry.

  I love you.

    That isn't good enough, though.

    I can't even name what our problems are, so I don't see how those
  problems could ever be fixed.

    I have little faith that we can communicate without professional
  assistance.

    Are you ready for that?

    Have you been getting therapy for yourself?

    You said you wanted to do that first, so that's more waiting limbo =
for
  me. Anyway, I think you're right.

    Our feelings have never been able to make up for our problems. I'm =
trying
  to solve my own problems now.

    I don't think I can be any good to anyone until I'm good with =
myself. I
  never wanted to lose you either.

    But it would be far worse to lose myself, and I'm the one who needs =
all
  of my spare time and effort right now. I wish it didn't have to be =
this
  way.

    There's this part of me that's trying to figure out the magic thing =
to
  say to make everything work out in the end for us.

    But that's just me trying to manipulate the situation.

    I can't control this or make it work out. You do what you've gotta =
do.

    I'm doing what I have to do.

    I don't exactly miss you.

    You're heart left me so long ago, I got used to you being gone.

  I miss the memory of you from long, long ago, when you were a god to =
me and
  I wanted to be just like you.

    I miss how I felt about myself when I met you.

    I felt pretty and amazing and creative and like I was an =
extraordinary
  being.

    And I thought all of that about you, too.

    Somehow, for both of us, our self-esteem and excitement about being =
in
  the world slowly eroded. Maybe all those good feelings in the =
beginning
  were artificial, or exaggerated. But I'm trying to emerge for real =
now.
  I'm not looking to you to help me feel good about myself, or blaming =
you
  for making me feel bad about myself. I don't know what you're doing, =
or
  how you feel.

    I can't be responsible for that.

  So why are you angry with me for cutting you off?

    What would you have me

    I didn't want to talk to you anymore because I didn't want to go
  through the agony of hoping it would work out for us. Especially when =
you
  wouldn't even commit to trying. I think I also wanted to prove that =
I'm not
  like      .

    But maybe it's you who's like      .

    Maybe you enjoy the unstable drama of loving someone who doesn't =
give you
  what you want.

  I'm getting what I want for myself.

  I want things to work out for us somehow, but only on terms that feel =
right
  and healthy.

    I don't know what that would be like, exactly.

  This is a long letter.

    Longer than         wants right now.

    He's singing "          " in my face to get my attention. He misses =
you.

    He asked if you could come over Thursday night.

    I didn't know if it was better to say yes or no.

  I know nothing.

I am trying to read some of these posts and the one I sent but I realise
that mine - because I just watched an Ali G movie I cant get his voice and
accents and jiving out of my head so its all crazy  - cant even think !

Really funny bloke old Ali G !!!

But I cant make sense of anything just now - the post I sent seems even more
bizarre than I intended (because of the typos actually I didn't intend
anything - I just write what comes into my head as I am writing- bugger
intending things - because of my spelling mistakes  (mis-types) and one hour
or so of Ali G clowning around and soon.....cant even work out what Ron was
talking about - something about killing babies

(water test down a bit -)

Havent been following this but its a bit like Aaron's jive  - very funny
(well droll) pseudo politics thing

I just glanced at it and that D Barratier fellow is a naughty naughty maker

sent from the US to find out what makes the ASB (bannk) "diffrent") by his
boss (its a story)  - and a few others - but mostly there is this terrible
shouting so I switch the news off in the middle and forget what is coming -
might revert to listening to the News on the radio.

Then does any of it matter - the News - we cant change anything - what does
it matter about something about to happen ot that has happened  - mostly it
doesnt - to each of us - we all have enough problems ourselves...?

I did that water thing - drink water and then describe it -enjoyed it - hope
that was fair dinkum....

Bloody hard to describe the taste of water - keep (kept) thinking of what I
know or knew about water...arther than focusing on what was it realy like -
this sensation/taste of water?

[from the land of Bennett and Baratier....]

Lawmaker says profs are pushing agendas
  Thursday, January 27, 2005
  Kathy Lynn Gray
  THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH

  Legislation that would restrict what university professors could say =20=

in their classrooms was introduced yesterday in Ohio.

  Judging from reactions in other states where similar bills have been =20=

considered, controversy won=92t be far behind.

  Marion Sen. Larry A. Mumper=92s "academic bill of rights for higher =20=

education" would prohibit instructors at public or private universities =20=

from "persistently" discussing controversial issues in class or from =20
using their classes to push political, ideological, religious or =20
anti-religious views.

  Senate Bill 24 also would prohibit professors from discriminating =20
against students based on their beliefs and keep universities from =20
hiring, firing, promoting or giving tenure to instructors based on =20
their beliefs.

  Mumper, a Republican, said many professors undermine the values of =20
their students because "80 percent or so of them (professors) are =20
Democrats, liberals or socialists or card-carrying Communists" who =20
attempt to indoctrinate students.

  "These are young minds that haven=92t had a chance to form their own =20=

opinions," Mumper said. "Our colleges and universities are still filled =20=

with some of the =9260s and =9270s profs that were the anti-American =
group. =20
They=92ve gotten control of how to give people tenure and so the =
colleges =20
continue to move in this direction."

  Joan McLean, a political-science professor at Ohio Wesleyan =20
University, said Mumper=92s legislation is misguided and would have a =20=

chilling effect on the free-flowing debate that is a hallmark of =20
democracy.

  "This is not the kind of democracy we think we=92re spreading when we =20=

hear President Bush=92s words. What we=92re celebrating is our ability =
to =20
not control information."

  Besides, McLean said, who would define what issues could not be =20
discussed?

  The language of Mumper=92s bill comes from a 2003 booklet by =20
conservative commentator David Horowitz that lays out how students can =20=

persuade universities to adopt the "bill of rights." The booklet says =20=

it is "dedicated to restoring academic freedom and educational values =20=

to America=92s institutions of higher learning."

  The issue has gone national.

  Horowitz created Students for Academic Freedom, a group based in =20
Washington that has chapters on 135 campuses, to promote his views.

  On the other side, the American Association of University Professors, =20=

which has thousands of members at hundreds of campuses, argues that =20
eliminating controversial issues from courses waters down academic =20
freedoms.

  Mumper said he=92s been investigating the issue for months and has =
heard =20
of an Ohio student who said she was discriminated against because she =20=

supported Bush for president.

  "I think the bill asks that colleges and universities be fair in their =
=20
approach to their education of students," Mumper said. "They need to =20
have their rights defended and need to be respected by faculty and =20
administrators."

  In a Kenyon College publication, President S. Georgia Nugent called =20=

Horowitz=92s thinking "a severe threat" to academic freedom.

  "I see this so-called bill of rights, the platform that he has =20
constructed, as one that would explicitly introduce into college and =20
university appointments a kind of political litmus test," she said.

  Mumper said he will "push this all the way" so that it=92s approved by =
=20
either the legislature or by individual universities.

  When a similar proposal was considered in the Colorado legislature =20
last year, it was withdrawn after state universities agreed to some of =20=

its principles. The issue also has been debated in Indiana and =20
considered in Congress.

Looks to me like someone nasty is impersonating Silliman. Assuming it
isn't some uncharacteristically very bad taste by him, he might want
to look into the possibility someone has hacked his account. (It looks
like it's from the same address as his blog updates, but I didn't look
that closely at the email headers to find signs of spoofing.)

If it is an impersonation, it's saddening. You see this sort of
pathetic crap all the time on Usenet discussion groups, but not
usually private, moderated lists like this one.

I'm on digest mode, so I don't know if anyone else brought this up, but
it was David Tudor who first performed 4'33" at a concert in Woodstock.
  The piece is in three parts, and Tudor lowered and raised the lid of
the keyboard to signal the beginnings and endings of each movement.

There are actually several versions of the score, one of them including
instructions to the musicians with one of my favorite words, "TACET."

An interesting website of research behind the piece and its development
and performance: http://music.research.home.att.net/4min33se.htm

U.S. Scientists Say They Are Told to Alter Findings
More than 200 Fish and Wildlife researchers cite cases where =20
conclusions were reversed to weaken protections and favor business, a =20=

survey finds.


By Julie Cart, Times Staff Writer

More than 200 scientists employed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service =20=

say they have been directed to alter official findings to lessen =20
protections for plants and animals, a survey released Wednesday says.

The survey of the agency's scientific staff of 1,400 had a 30% response =20=

rate and was conducted jointly by the Union of Concerned Scientists and =20=

Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.

=A0 A division of the Department of the Interior, the Fish and Wildlife =20=

Service is charged with determining which animals and plants should be =20=

placed on the endangered species list and designating areas where such =20=

species need to be protected.

More than half of the biologists and other researchers who responded to =20=

the survey said they knew of cases in which commercial interests, =20
including timber, grazing, development and energy companies, had =20
applied political pressure to reverse scientific conclusions deemed =20
harmful to their business.

Bush administration officials, including Craig Manson, an assistant =20
secretary of the Interior who oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service, =20=

have been critical of the 1973 Endangered Species Act, contending that =20=

its implementation has imposed hardships on developers and others while =20=

failing to restore healthy populations of wildlife.

Along with Republican leaders in Congress, the administration is =20
pushing to revamp the act. The president's proposed budget calls for a =20=

$3-million reduction in funding of Fish and Wildlife's endangered =20
species programs.

"The pressure to alter scientific reports for political reasons has =20
become pervasive at Fish and Wildlife offices around the country," said =20=

Lexi Shultz of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Mitch Snow, a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said the =20
agency had no comment on the survey, except to say "some of the basic =20=

premises just aren't so."

The two groups that circulated the survey also made available memos =20
from Fish and Wildlife officials that instructed employees not to =20
respond to the survey, even if they did so on their own time. Snow said =20=

that agency employees could not use work time to respond to outside =20
surveys.

Fish and Wildlife scientists in 90 national offices were asked 42 =20
questions and given space to respond in essay form in the mail-in =20
survey sent in November.

One scientist working in the Pacific region, which includes California, =20=

wrote: "I have been through the reversal of two listing decisions due =20=

to political pressure. Science was ignored =97 and worse, manipulated, =
to =20
build a bogus rationale for reversal of these listing decisions."

More than 20% of survey responders reported they had been "directed to =20=

inappropriately exclude or alter technical information."

However, 69% said they had never been given such a directive. And, =20
although more than half of the respondents said they had been ordered =20=

to alter findings to lessen protection of species, nearly 40% said they =20=

had never been required to do so.

Sally Stefferud, a biologist who retired in 2002 after 20 years with =20
the agency, said Wednesday she was not surprised by the survey results, =20=

saying she had been ordered to change a finding on a biological =20
opinion.

"Political pressures influence the outcome of almost all the cases," =20
she said. "As a scientist, I would probably say you really can't trust =20=

the science coming out of the agency."

A biologist in Alaska wrote in response to the survey: "It is one thing =20=

for the department to dismiss our recommendations, it is quite another =20=

to be forced (under veiled threat of removal) to say something that is =20=

counter to our best professional judgment."

Don Lindburg, head of the office of giant panda conservation at the =20
Zoological Society of San Diego, said it was unrealistic to expect =20
federal scientists to be exempt from politics or pressure.

"I've not stood in the shoes of any of those scientists," he said. "But =20=

it is not difficult for me to believe that there are pressures from =20
those who are not happy with conservation objectives, and here I am =20
referring to development interest and others.

"But when it comes to altering data, that is a serious matter. I am =20
really sorry to hear that scientists working for the service feel they =20=

have to do that. Changing facts to fit the politics =97 that is a very =20=

unhealthy thing. If I were a scientist in that position I would just =20
refuse to do it."

The Union of Concerned Scientists and the public employee group =20
provided copies of the survey and excerpts from essay-style responses.

One biologist based in California, who responded to the survey, said in =20=

an interview with The Times that the Fish and Wildlife Service was not =20=

interested in adding any species to the endangered species list.

"For biologists who do endangered species analysis, my experience is =20
that the majority of them are ordered to reverse their conclusions [if =20=

they favor listing]. There are other biologists who will do it if you =20=

won't," said the biologist, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

with its all morning taste of postage
and applied a salve of cashews.

At my window, looking at rain
melting
snow
birds in the hedges
and squirrels eager for my tulips
that they can hear stretching
below the white sounds
of the work week.

Yes. It was probably Tilbury who first performed it in UK. I always found
the fact that both names begin with T confusing ;)

one of the more over the top performances was seen on a public television
broadcast years ago -- a piano was placed in heavy traffic (round it was,
and of a port in air) in, I think maybe Boston Common or Cambridge --
whichever, you get the idea --

of course it worked, but I wondered at the time about the many renditions
of this that deliberately put themselves in the way of as much noise as
possible, almost as if not trusting to the composer and the audience and
the ambience --

Mary,

I am interested this, too, except that I think it is a blind alley, an instance of someone saying they have found the "ding-an-sich," or a cry to find it.  To my mind, Wittgenstein did not consign poetry to an endless repetition of the so-called real.  This seems to be how his mantra that philosophy nothing but therapy for the delusions it creates.  In any case, that is a broad generalization about the project Philosophical Investigations, a work that was never finished, and in any case is not written in the consecutive and consequential style of the Tractatus.  The PI is a case of analysis interminable.  It does, however, start with an explosion of Wittgenstein's previous work and much of western philosophy back to Descartes.  He says that a picture had us bewitched.  By saying that, he is saying good-bye to a correspondence theory of truth and naive representationalism, the bulwarks of the quest for certainty.

Instead, PI posits that language only can be understood as a game, or rather games.  This does not mean that we are fully in charge or cognizant and--perhaps this is not Wittgenstein--the games don't change and evolve, as humans evidently do.  But Wittgenstein does seem to believe that getting beyond games--in a way that is certain, rather than simply speculative--is impossible.  Now, if getting beyond the games is how poetry is to liberate language, well, I just don't get that.  Language can never point to anything outside itself.  It is our reception of it and the full web of understanding that happens in a communicative that allows language to be a vehicle for meaning.

Why not simply go back to Shelley and his belief that poetry reanimates the language of the tribe? It gives us new expressions and sometimes, with it, new experiences.  But to look in a language or in poetry for certainty, that I am afraid is a delusion.  It is exactly the picture that bewitches.

===================

Trying to think through the Brown quote (given in my posting under the
subject
"The topic in a different light") in case anyone's still interested:
When Brown talks about "linguistic analysts [who] have had the project of
getting rid of the disease in language by reducing language to purely
operational terms," I think he's referring to theories of language which insist that
language has no meaning except what it's given by its context. In this view,
language is "purely" operational because it is atelic: it operates
without operating to any end; it works without working *for* anything; it
means without meaning anything in particular. Obviously this view is, or at
least is close to, the view of language which has subsequently become popularly
known as structuralist or post-structuralist. A poetics based on such a
view -- what I called a Witttgensteinian poetics -- will see the role of poetry
as being to liberate language from the delusory quality that
Wittgenstein attributed to it, in order to ... what?

In order to do nothing. And this is the problem. The purpose of liberating
language should be to enable the poet to use it to reveal meanings which
can't
be revealed if language remains bound to what we deludedly call reality, if
the words remain locked in their nominalist prison. It's dream-work. Just
as
the psyche's dream-worker can only construct symbolic meaning by liberating
sensory images from their quotidian meaning, so the poet can only construct
meaning in a language which has been liberated from the delusion that it
represents our experience. Or to put it another way, words must be liberated
from their ordinary meanings before the poet is able to use them to construct
metaphors, and metaphor, as Aristotle said, is the essence of poetic genius.

There are indeed times when a cigar is only a cigar, but the dream time,
whether of the psychic dream worker, the shaman, or the poet,
isn't one of them.
The result of a poetics that stops with Wittgenstein instead of beginning
with
him will be a poetry that offers nothing but a savor of the meaninglessness
of
the universe: it will be a poetry that turns the world into a kalaidescope
which it invites us to delight in passively like a baby reclining under a
fascinating jangling and shining crib toy.

And from a psychoanalytic standpoint the profoundly infantile nature of such
a
poetry cannot of course be accidental. Reversion to infantile passivity is
the classic simple hysterical response to prolonged unbearable threat. The
constructors of such a poetry are acting as artists in spite of themselves,
imitating the action of the human self in a world which has made it
impossible
to live a human life. The unconscious message of such poetry is, "Please
don't hurt me."
=====================================
Jon Corelis jonc@stanfordalumni.org
_www.geocities.com/joncpoetics_ (http://www.geocities.com/joncpoetics)
I offered the Norman O. Brown quote here because I thought it has a striking
and specific relevance to contemporary poetics. Brown wrote that some
"linguistic analysts have had the project of getting rid of the disease in
language by reducing language to purely operational terms." It seems to me
that some contemporary American poets have engaged in a similar project to
create a poetry which uses language purely operationally, and for the same
reason: as part of what Wittgenstein called philosophy's "battle against the
bewitchment [Verhexung] of our intelligence by means of language."

I think that this project, as Brown also says of the project of the
linguistic
analysts he mentioned, will fail because it is impossible, and anyway would
be
pointless if it succeeded. As Brown says, "a purely operational language
would be a language without a libidinal (erotic) component; and
psychoanalysis
would suggest that such a project is impossible because language, like man,
has an erotic base, and also useless because man cannot be persuaded to
operate (work) for operation's sake." For "language" in the foregoing
sentence substitute "poetry," and you can take it as a critique of certain
current avant-garde poetics.
Poetry, like psychoanalysis, should begin where Wittgenstein ends. A
Wittgensteinian poetics will result only in an aridly endless restatement of
the problem, but what the poet must provide is a solution.
Jon Corelis jonc@stanfordalumni.org
_www.geocities.com/joncpoetics_ (http://www.geocities.com/joncpoetics)
========================
If, in the history of every child, language is first of all a mode of erotic
expression and then later succumbs to the domination of the
reality-principle,
it follows, or perhaps we should say mirrors, the path taken by the human
psyche and must share the ultimate fate of the human psyche, namely neurosis
... To regard human speech, the self-evident sign of our superiority over
animals, as a disease, or at least as essentially diseased, is for common
sense ... a monstrous hypothesis. Yet psychoanalysis, which insists on the
necessary connection between cultural achievement and neurosis and between
social organization and neurosis, and which therefore defines man as the
neurotic animal, can hardly take any other position. ... if psychoanalysis is
carried to the logical conclusion that language is neurotic, it can join
hands
with the twentieth century school of linguistic analysis -- a depth analysis
of language -- inspired by that man with a real genius for the
psychopathology
of language, Wittgenstein. He said, "Philosophy is a battle against the
bewitchment [Verhexung] of our intelligence by means of language."
Some of these linguistic analysts have had the project of getting rid of the
disease in language by reducing language to purely operational terms. From
the psychoanalytic point of view, a purely operational language would be a
language without a libidinal (erotic) component; and psychoanalysis would
suggest that such a project is impossible because language, like man, has an
erotic base, and also useless because man cannot be persuaded to operate
(work) for operation's sake. Wittgenstein, if I understand him correctly,
has
a position much closer to that of psychoanalysis; he limits the task of
philosophy to that of recognizing the inevitable insanity of language. "My
aim is," he says, "to teach you to pass from a piece of disguised nonsense to
something that is patent nonsense." "He who understands me finally
recognizes
[my propositions] as senseless." Psychoanalysis begins where Wittgenstein
ends. The problem is not the disease of language, but the disease called
man.

>I am interested this, too, except that I think it is a blind alley, an instance of someone saying they have found the "ding-an-sich," or a cry to find it.  To my mind, Wittgenstein did not consign poetry to an endless repetition of the so-called real.

What does he mean then by being caught like a fly in a box?

This seems to be how his mantra that philosophy nothing but therapy for the delusions it creates.  In any case, that is a broad generalization about the project Philosophical Investigations, a work that was never finished, and in any case is not written in the consecutive and consequential style of the Tractatus.

By "consequential" do you mean important or logically connected?

The PI is a case of analysis interminable.  It does, however, start with an explosion of Wittgenstein's previous work and much of western philosophy back to Descartes.  He says that a picture had us bewitched.  By saying that, he is saying good-bye to a correspondence theory of truth and naive representationalism, the bulwarks of the quest for certainty.

He is saying that language games are tautological. Because of that they are not about the world, They are illusions. But he himself is involved in a language game; that's why a fly in a box. Metaphysics (PI), a constant engine of tearing down of illusions through illusions.
>
>Instead, PI posits that language only can be understood as a game, or rather games.  This does not mean that we are fully in charge or cognizant and--perhaps this is not Wittgenstein--the games don't change and evolve, "

What does exactly "evolve" mean? Does the "old" inherently contain everything in the "new" or doesn't it? If it does not, then the system is not closed. If it does, then nothing "new" (therefore nothing) is being said.

"...as humans evidently do.  But Wittgenstein does seem to believe that getting beyond games--in a way that is certain, rather than simply speculative--is impossible."

Yes, that's true. That's why he feels and senses caught like a fly. Wittgenstein makes empiricism (Locke, also the rationalizer of property) come face to face with its inherent contradictions (Marx). Tractatus and PI are works of empiricism in extremis. The real attack against this thinking does not come from Descartes but from Kant, Hegel, Heidegger, Benjamin, all believers in essences. The real attack on Wittgenstein, etal, is not that words have pictures which they represent; rather that, words (language) are part of a reality which they can not completely cover. Words and experience do not completely cover each other; they are not a perfect, tautological fit.

In attempts to cross that gap (distance, imperfect fit) that language renews itself.

"Now, if getting beyond the games is how poetry is to liberate language, well, I just don't get that.  Language can never point to anything outside itself."

All you are saying is that you can not disagree with Wittgenstein.

"It is our reception of it and the full web of understanding that happens in a communicative that allows language to be a vehicle for meaning."

One can equally look at Wittgenstein's view of language as a tool with generates (can generate) no meaning.


>
>Why not simply go back to Shelley and his belief that poetry reanimates the language of the tribe?

What does Shelley have to do with Wittgenstein?

 "It gives us new expressions and sometimes, with it, new experiences.  But to look in a language or in poetry for certainty, that I am afraid is a delusion."

Who said one is looking at language for certainty. That's the point, it is full of uncertainty, insufficiency.

"It is exactly the picture that bewitches."

A good description of W.'s work, an attempt not to be bewitched which bewitches.


Ciao.

>
>An excerpt from Perry Link's fascinating review of He Qunglian's book 'How
>the Chinese Government Controls the Media'. The below is reproduced without
>permission but with respect. It appeared in the February 24, 2005 issue of
>The New York Review of Books (pages 38-39) -- http://nybooks.com
>

>
>**************************
>
>The Internet, which has grown explosively in China, has become the biggest
>obstacle to the government's  control of information. In 1997 the country
>had about 620,000 Internet  users; today there are about 80 million,=
 whether
>they use home computiers or frequent the "Internet caf=E9s" on the streets.
>E-mail--flexible, fast, and unorganized--is the most frustrating medium the
>Party has ever confronted.
>
>But if the problem has been large for Chinese officials, so are their
>efforts to control it. In 1996 the government started issuing proclamations
>forbidding the use of the Internet to circulate information objectionable=
 to
>the regime, but it soon realized that this was futile. He Qinglian=
 describes
>how, beginning in 1998, the Ministry of State Security recruited a great
>many young university graduates with high-tech skills to monitor and=
 control
>the Internet. Today there are thousands of them surfing the Web in search=
 of
>anti-Party opinions. Anmesty International has estimated that there are=
 some
>30,000 but no one outside the system knows for sure. When they find
>something they want to suppress they have a number of choices. If the
>offending Web site is foreign, they can block it, either temporarily or
>permanently, and sometimes can edit it electronically. If the Web site is
>domestic, they can issue a warning or they can close it down, a practice
>more common during "sevsitive periods" like the run-up to a Party congress
>or to an anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. In early 2003, during
>the SARS cover-up, forty-two of Google's one hundred most frequently=
 visited
>sites were blocked in China.
>
>If electronic methods fail, the police can be sent to deal with the
>offending blogger. Then the sanctions become essentially the same as for
>work in print: "rectifications," fines, confiscation of money and=
 equipment,
>closings, and in extreme cases, arrests.  Of sixty-nine people throughout
>the world listed by Reporters Without Borders as in jail for using the
>Internet, sixty one are in China, where most of them have been charged with
>"subversion" and given sentences ranging from two to twelve years. Four
>Internet offenders, all from Falun Gong, have died in prison.
>
>And yet even these measures have not been enough to control the Web.
>Electronic cat-and-mouse games continue between bloggers and the regime. In
>recent months the government has added psychological weapons to its offense
>in an effort to induce Web users to srart policing one another and, by
>generating fear, to make people censor themselves.
>
>In Auguest 2002 new regulations required that Web publishers in China have
>organizations, bylaws, and an editorial system in which they assign a
>"responsible editor" to supervise each article they publish. In form these
>rules only bring Web publishers into line with print and other publishers.
>But the real intent was to ban personal Web sites. Now at least two people,
>and usually more, must be collectively accountable for what any one of them
>does on the Internet, and hence each has an incentive to watch the others
>and prevent their mistakes. Similar techniques of enforcing collective
>responsibility have ancient roots in China, and were much used during the
>Mao years.
>
>Moreover, Web sites are being held responsible not only for their own
>postings but those of all chat room visitors; managers are therefore=
 obliged
>to stand in for the government, monitoring and censoring what gets posted.
>Managers of Internet caf=E9s can be punished if any of their customers=
 sends
>or receives illicit messages. During the "sensitive periods," caf=E9s and=
 Web
>sites thus ask their visitors to be careful, to "please cooperate," and so
>on. He Qinglian points out that this system tends to encourage a perverse
>assumption in the minds of all concerned, namely, that if someone does=
 "make
>a mistake" and precipitate a shutdown, the calamity is the fault of that
>person, not the government.
>
>In early 2004 the government set up a new chinese Center for Informing on
>Illegal and Harmful Information, which hugely expanded the possibilities=
 for
>anyone, anywhere, to report bad thinking to the Chinese police by sending=
 an
>email to jubao@china.org.cn ( net.china.cn/chinese/index.htm ). "Jubao"
>means "informing". If you want to attack your enemies, however, it is
>illegal to do so anonymously. Another recent rule for the Chinese Web says
>that surfers must use their real names, a requirement that naturally
>strengthens the Web user's "self-discipline".  In March 2003 the government
>asked Internet service providers in China to sign on voluntarily to a
>"Public Pledge of Self-Discipline for the China Internet Industry". About
>three hundred providers, Yahoo among them, did so.
>
>In her conclusion He Qinglian touches on the most sensitive question of all
>when she analyzes the term "state security," which is used by the regime to
>justify its efforts to block news from reaching the public. The regime also
>claims that popular elections above the village level will not work because
>the suzhi (quality, character) of the people is too low. The masses are
>ignorant, and would be too easily swayed by passion or bias. Therefore,=
 they
>coninue, we, the masters of the regime, have to be in control. The logic is
>not only humiliating to the Chinese people but oddly circular: we must, the
>regime says, run things in our own repressive way because the people are
>ignorant, and the people are ignorant in large part because we keep them
>from being informed. The result is described as "stability". But the lesson
>of He Qinglian's book is that it is the security of the dictatorial system
>itself that is at stake.

>Back to the Future: Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music at NYU
>
>Revisits Landmark Hip Hop Album
>Rapper Chuck D and members of Public Enemy join film director Brett
>Ratner and a host of critics, producers, engineers and executives for
>seminar exploring The Making of Public Enemy's "It Takes A Nation Of
>Millions To Hold Us Back"
>
>
>
>
>On Friday, February 25 and Saturday, February 26 a two-day seminar at
>New York University (NYU) will examine the making of what music critics
>and hip hop aficionados widely regard as one of hip hop's seminal
>albums, Public Enemy's It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.
>The 1988 Def Jam recording was a critical and commercial success,
>spinning off the controversial singles "Don't Believe the Hype" and
>"Bring The Noise."  The album made stars of MCs Chuck D and Flava Flav
>and ushered in an era of political rap often referred to as the "golden
>age" of the genre.  The seminar, sponsored by NYU's Clive Davis
>Department of Recorded Music, will feature a documentary film of Public
>Enemy's 1988 and 2002 tours of Great Britain as well as panel
>discussions on the making of the album and the political climate that
>inspired the artists.  All events will be held at NYU's Tischman
>Auditorium (40 Washington Square South between McDougal and Sullivan)
>and are free and open to the public.
>
>
>
>"Nation of Millions was one of the most important albums of its time.
>The lyrics were hard-hitting and confrontational and the music was
>visionary. It captures an era in which a certain type of politics was
>possible," says Jason King, organizer of the event and associate chair
>of the Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music.  "This seminar will be
>the first time that many of the players -- the producers, engineers, the
>artists -- have been together since 1988.  We'll explore their memories
>of the making of the music and find out what's happened to them.
>They've all gone on to big things."
>
>
>
>On Friday, February 25, the seminar gets underway at 6:00 p.m. with the
>film screening, "Public Enemy: London Calling."  The documentary film,
>directed by Lathan Hodge, is a work-in-progress that follows Public
>Enemy's British tour and features never-before-seen footage of the
>group's performances.  That same evening, beginning at 7:45, a panel of
>top journalists and critics who covered the era will discuss the music
>legacy of Public Enemy and It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us
>Back.  Participants include Robert Christgau, Nelson George, Vivien
>Goldman, John Leland, Alan Light and Jon Caramanica.
>
>
>
>On Saturday, February 26 at noon, the first panel of the day will
>feature members of the Def Jam and Rush Arts teams -- the creative staff
>behind the album's A&R, publicity, management and marketing.
>Participants include film director Brett Ratner (Rush Hour) -- who got
>his start directing Public Enemy's first video, "Louder Than a Bomb" --
>as well as Bill Adler, Lisa Cortes, Charlotte Hunter, Biff Warren, Kelly
>Haley and others.  The day continues with "On Hip Hop and Political
>Activism: A Conversation with photographer Glen E. Friedman and author
>and activist Jeff Chang" (1:45 p.m.).  Friedman, the author of Fuck You
>Heroes and The Idealist, photographed and designed the album's cover.
>Chang is the author of the new book Can't Stop Won't Stop: The History
>of the Hip Hop Generation.  At 3:30 p.m., the panel "Producing The
>Album" will bring together the album's original engineers, the owners of
>the Greene Street studio (where the album was cut) and members of the
>Bomb Squad production team for the first time since 1988.  Participants
>include Rod Hui, Steve Loeb, Nick Sansano, Chris Shaw, Hank Shocklee,
>Keith Shocklee and Chairman Mao.
>
>
>
>The seminar's final panel, "Revolutionary Voices" (6:00-8:00 p.m.),
>features the members of Public Enemy.  Public Enemy frontman Chuck D
>joins surprise guests in a reflection on their experiences in the making
>of the legendary album.
>
>
>
>"Whether you're nostalgic for political music or old school hip hop, or
>whether you just want a behind-the-scenes look at how great records are
>produced, this is a terrific opportunity," says King.
>
>
>
>"The Making of Public Enemy's It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us
>Back" is a presentation of NYU's Tisch School of the Arts in association
>with African Heritage Month, Shocklee Entertainment and Scratch Magazine
>(a leading magazine for hip hop DJs and producers).  All events are held
>at Tischman Auditorium on the NYU campus (40 Washington Square South,
>between McDougal and Sullivan), and are free and open to the public.

>The Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music officially opened its doors
>in September 2003. It is the first program of its kind to offer artistic
>training to aspiring record producers and music executives toward a BFA
>(Bachelor of Fine Arts) degree in Recorded Music. Students not only
>learn to produce records in a state-of-the art recording facility, they
>also study the business and craft of music production (A&R, songwriting,
>music publishing, radio, film and new media) as well as the history and
>culture of popular music.
>
>
>
>The program bears the name of its patron and chief advisor to the
>program, Clive Davis. Mr. Davis explains his rationale for funding this
>program as such: "I've felt for many years that serious, career-minded
>students of recorded music should have their own school, just as film
>aspirants have had and benefited from for decades."
>
>
>
>The Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music is also the first to offer
>concentrated courses in R&B and hip hop production (as well as rock and
>pop) toward a BFA degree.
>
>
>
>The Department of Recorded Music is part of the Tisch School of the
>Arts, one of the nation's leading centers of undergraduate and graduate
>study in the performing and media arts. The school's alumni consist of
>many of the country's leading film directors, Broadway producers and
>writers, as well as theater historians and critics.

what you carry in your clothes
is not gold, driver, it's bones


in my ledgers the State
is so hot for, officer,
each blunder is made by
only five bales of bread


bread blunders of orange ouch,
vast, vast is the relenting dent...
of that dent: I'm in this, & in brass
& waltz-like of malignity, tho I
called for something light, driver,
you'll leaf razzle, rust and pocket


this grows, out, map, out & into files...
driver, whose visible groves were these?
the missing accident daughter? well, then,
her leaps MUST have been impenetrable...


there was more than one? surely
a couple of them at least will
top this writing with wish words
who half in kicks grow skill - hist!,
someone rouses my syllables:


wind my names up, you
seaward grudge, you
kissing-foot thing,


move along now,
missing accident daughters,
your speech is live, mine
is reluctant willows, Herr
B's is flowers in hand...


flowers & hand: they,
the flowers, love hand?


missing accident
daughters, here
your pieces roam to
ghost that low form
of Herr Bibliothekarius,
so this poem's sudden guest
can dream his eye chirps Logic's sun
instead of Curiosity's eyes... oh, &
here you'll think understanding away, Sirens

one of the more over the top performances was seen on a public television
broadcast years ago -- a piano was placed in heavy traffic (round it was,
and of a port in air) in, I think maybe Boston Common or Cambridge --
whichever, you get the idea --

of course it worked, but I wondered at the time about the many renditions
of this that deliberately put themselves in the way of as much noise as
possible, almost as if not trusting to the composer and the audience and
the ambience --

Improvised Music and Poetry:-

Saturday 19 Feb  From 8PM=20
At the Old Queens Head, Pond Street, Sheffield

Stunning music and poetry

Beck +Hession -
                Mick Beck, tenor sax, bassoon, whistles
                Paul Hession, drumset

And Geraldine Monk - readings


=A35 waged, =A33 unwaged




The Beck/Hession duo is legendary for focus and power.  Together they =
can knock an audience sideways.  Spiky or humorous, compelling, fluent =
they offer the best of abstract free and dangerous driving.  If that =
doesn't work, they go head over heels, plunging into uncharted waters, =
or end up in a ditch.



The international poet Geraldine Monk's writings and readings are of =
world renown. A provocative mixture of the random, the alien and the =
familiar.

Even if I have a piece in the Big Bridge, I am not going to hold back from a
hearty congratulations to Michael Rothenberg (back from the burn!) and his
four associate editors for putting together a great issue, made the more so
by the fact of its very readable, attractive design. I do believe Michael
and company are really working out the graphic issues that make the web a
genuine medium for the visual (design/typographic) challenge of "reading on
line." Compared to this - yes, what you are reading - Bridge is pure visual
/ 'lisable' luxury.

Just getting into much of it. Joanne Kyger's elegy for Don Allen is quickly
worth the non-price of cracking the 'http://www....'

to quickly concur, this is a great issue.

I still have confess that I don't really get where the american midwest
is. it's kind of like British Columbia, which is neither.

a great job all.

Mairead--

Thanks for the poem. I have thoroughly enjoyed our Oatmealee.
I hope you will dispense royalties, per word or per page
for my part when this appears in your next book.

Second, I might owe you an apology,
it is not that I do not know your name
but there is an intentional mispelling each time I write it.
I have been thinking a stress-mark into the e-mail
just before I send it  and since you have not said anything
I thought it might be working but I wanted to be clear.

Be well

3 videos from HEAP

HEAP is a collection of experimental video
portraits of Westerners who have studied,
invented, misunderstood and loved China.=A0 These
videos explore the multiple misunderstandings and
rare moments of connection between two cultures.
By focusing on individual historic personages
like John Searle, G.W. Leibnitz and Robert van
Gulik, I hope to follow the complex attitudes
that have developed in the West, creating an
ambiguous and intense portrait of cultural
contact.

(tongue tongue stone) G. W. Leibnitz=A0=A0=A0 2002=A0=A0=A0=A0 9:36 minutes

Follow a trail of associations, close-up,
caressing the surfaces of unusual rocks and folds
of falling silk, hear the ringing sonorous
stones.=A0 A man and a dog carry rocks in their
mouths.=A0 Leibnitz, the philosopher of surfaces
and interconnected depths, invented binary
arithmetic because of a misunderstanding of the
I-Ching.

(The Chinese Room) John Searle=A0=A0=A0 2001=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =
7:30 minutes

A little girl running, reflections of a garden,
calligraphy, tourists on a misty mountaintop.=A0 A
boy shouts in Chinese:=A0 ~Syou can~Rt shoot here.~T
The philosopher, John Searle, wrote about a
thought experiment called ~SThe Chinese Room.~T
He needed a foreign language to prove his point ;
he chose Chinese

(unsolved) Robert van Gulik=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 2003=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 18:03 minutes

Referring to the Dutch diplomat van Gulik~Rs many
interests, this video is a mystery story with no
resolution ~V included are the ancient Chinese
musical instrument, guqin; the wonderful ape
called gibbon; the Judge Dee mysteries
intermingled with a Caucasian man who is
transformed into the Chinese opera character
Judge Bao.=A0 Meanwhile, there~Rs something hidden
under the tarp on that boat ~V is it a body?

Leslie Thornton

Adynata=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 30 minutes

An impossible world of exoticism and difference,
an ~SOrient~T noticeably constructed in a play of
seductive surfaces.=A0 The film begins with an
instance of fact~Wa formal portrait taken in 19th
Century China of an aristocratic couple~Wthen
proceeds on a series of false penetrations on a
course of vulgar tourism of the ~SOther.~T=A0 This
inscrutable Other is seen variously as history,
culture, woman, eroticism, madness, and violence
through a complex of resonances which both engage
the viewer in pursuit and deny any solace of
~Sknowing.~T=A0 The surface remains constantly
opaque.~WL.T,

(World Premiere) A collage of landscapes; an
interview with filmmaker, Leslie Thornton, while
she is hooked up to a lie detector; a dance in a
red dress.=A0 Landscapes in places as various as
China, France, California.=A0 There are so many
images of landscape.=A0 Why would anyone travel
when we can travel in our imaginations?=A0 Digital
video cut with Super-8 and 16mm film

Subject:      "Grafik Dynamo" by Kate Armstrong and Michael Tippett
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Here's a new piece by Vancouver's Kate Armstrong and Michael Tippett:
http://turbulence.org/works/dynamo .

The press release says:

"Grafik Dynamo" is a net art work that loads live images from blogs and news
sources on the web into a live action comic strip. The work is currently
using a feed from LiveJournal. The images are accompanied by narrative
fragments that are dynamically loaded into speech and thought bubbles and
randomly displayed. Animating the comic strip using dynamic web content
opens up the genre in a new way: together, the images and narrative serve to
create a strange, dislocated notion of sense and expectation in the reader,
as they are sometimes at odds with each other, sometimes perfectly in sync,
and always moving and changing. The work takes an experimental approach to
open ended narrative, positing a new hybrid between the flow of data
animating the work and the formal parameter that comprises its structure.
"Grafik Dynamo" is a 2005 commission of New Radio and Performing Arts, Inc.
(aka Ether-Ore) for its Turbulence web site (New York). It was made possible
with funding from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.

Just like to clear any confusion, Malleable Jangle IS still accepting submissions for Issue 4 March. Looks like Michael Rothenberg's email accidently attached itself to my last post. Regards Robert Lane.

survived
many little wars. Dalachinsky's work appears regularly in journals on and

Indeed, Haiku Moment and the much praised anthology The Outlaw Bible of
American Poetry. He is he hopes, Steven Dalachinsky and no one else ? tho
that is
doubtful.

Merry Fortune

". . . a microscopic gauntlet of ?imaginary landscapes? where the
spiritual
and pedestrian share parity in a squirmingly comfortable way at both
exhilarating heights and disquieting depths. Created at times are edgy
musical
messages, just as Ayler?s strange, simple, melancholic melodies shared
space with his
weird impassioned howling and plaintive, overflowing cries. . . .
Desire?s
internal struggle opens into a sometimes frantic, sometimes sublime,
always
abstract abyss called life."
      ? Steven Dalachinsky on Ghosts by Albert Ayler, Ghosts by Albert
Ayler

Yes

This is reminiscentof Swift's A Modest Proposal - I cant make head or tail
of it - is it saying something against abortion? - via irony - in any case
it seems "muddled"  doesn't seem Ron's style - he is very bright....I also
like the thing by Swift that stopped the potential financial crippling of
Ireland.

There is no consensus here on the subject of  "right ot life" so the irony
is -by and large  - lost here (and this is not relevant to this List ) - of
course its possible it could ip inside another debate, as these things
do,but its not really anything to do - per se - with poetics..

Thank you, Richard Taylor, and I do remember now the occasion, decades back,
on which I saw the poem in The Making of Ulysses. My German is adequate
enough to translate the poem literally as

And now comes the war (3x)
Now they are all soldiers, i.e., Now everyoneÂ¹s a soldier
Soldiers must die.
Die they must.
Who will now kiss
My white body

Actually, Â³leibÂ² is body, Â³liebÂ² is the adjective for Â³dear,Â² from the noun
Â³liebeÂ² for love.

Bully for The Poetics List and gratitude to you.

(Baksun, 1998).  She has written several plays, one of which, Reduced
Tuesday, a collaboration with Camille Roy, was performed at the 2002 Poetry
Play Jamboree in San Francisco and is published online at Cauldron
Magazine. Levitsky is the creator of Belladonna*, NYC's

Steve,
Whether your know it or not, your are the biggest meme machine of all--you
are so possessed by memes that the memes don't want you to be conscious of
them!
Seriously, don't worry about it if you don't know consciously know what they
are or how they are defined, suffice to say that I am seeking text and
visual art (prose poems, visual poetry, found objects or whatever else you
want to call it). The theme is mostly for my amusement. If you google
"memes" you should  be able to find plenty of info, for example this site
defines them:

http://maxwell.lucifer.com/virus/alt.memetics/what.is.html

O if you have the time, read some Richard Dawkins. A good place to start is
the "Selfish Gene".

Visually, street memes is another great site: http://streetmemes.com/ though
I'm not nearly as strict for the need to be "self-replicating"... the
replication part comes when it is published. Think of your writings as ideas
that are in competition to replicate by being published.

Textually, I'm after encapsulated myths or the memetic equivalent of genetic
code. Definitely open to interpretation.

I think I list some other sites and resources on the submissions page:
http://www.sleepingfish.net/submit.htm
Apologies for not explaining it better.

All best

 Of course, it is also possible that message reflects Ron's point of view.
Given that Ron's background is Catholic, I assume that the message is genuine.
After all, is considering a foetus in the woman's belly alive such an
outrageous idea? Are all our choices absolute and limitless, doesn't the abortion issue
have any ambivalence?

Like Ron I am a parent t6hough a Jew. My wife had to have an abortion many
many years ago. The idea that we may have had a third person as precious, our
feelings as attached to her/him as our two sons haunts me to this day.

there are any number of oddities about this message -- which makes it a perfect
exemplum of the difficulties of interpretation. no?  the second part makes it
hard to read the first part as ironic in quite the way you might at first wish
to -- the entire thing is so over the top that it would not find a happy home
even with many right-to-life Catholics -- (the tone is quite unlike the tone of
MODEST PROPOSAL, for example) -- though it might sit well with the Randall
Terrys and Alan Keyes of this world --

and the second part of the message appears to make a number of truly strange
assumptions about the social class and background of people likely to get
abortions --

and an aside -- why is it that in the American politcal context, constant
reference is made to the Vatican's opposition to abortion, while we seldom hear
about the Vatican's equally vehement objections to the USA's penchant for
executions? asked ex-Baptist Aldon . . .

Abstract for the Roundtable Discussion=20
with Jena Osman:

Poet-critic Joan Retallack has described the poethical art form as "a =
form
of life in which we would, in our most enlightened moments, want to live =
-
[that] which makes the intricate complexity of the intersecting =
intentional
and accidental that is our world known to us through the sensory and
imaginative enactment of complex forms" ("Accident ...Aeroplane
...Artichoke"). I've been thinking about this concept in relation to a
comment Anne Waldman made a year or so ago at the Kelley Writers House =
in
Philadelphia about how now is a time of "outrageous metaphor and =
terrible
misnomers," what she called a kind of "interior terrorism." She said =
that
the best thing we can do right now as writers is study euphemism.
Poet-critic Barrett Watten said in a talk called "War=3DLanguage" that =
"We
need to take the mechanized hardware of the language of war apart - by
locating alternate evidence in multiple media, by questioning the
pseudo-objectivity of its delusional conclusions, by unpacking its =
embedded
metaphors and narrative frames, by thinking otherwise." There seemed to =
be a
necessary hope that as writers, pointing to language itself is a first =
step
toward action. But in what ways is that pointing poethical? Are there =
ways
to critique the topical world, the world of events, while at the same =
time
providing alternative "poethical" forms? In other words, in what ways =
can
words in poems make war, and in what ways can they make peace?

Tijuana writer and theorist HERIBERTO YEPEZ reads
next Thursday night, FEBRUARY 24
in the Mills Hall Living Room
@ 7:00

(w/ a reception to follow)

Among poets and writers who blog, Mexican writer and translator
Heriberto Yèpez is one of the most provocative voices, writing in both
Spanish and English and about/at the boundary of each language.
Relentless in his questioning of both totalitarian states and the role
of the poet/cultural worker, Heriberto’s aphorisms are an unsettling
salve for the global conditions we find ourselves in: “Poetry is the
power the writer has; the power s/h/e needs to fight, this power within,
not the power we invent as not-related-to-me, the power-of-the-other,
the one I can criticize to be heroic, to be a Poet. Write against your
own act.” Currently a professor of Philosophy at UABC-Tijuana, Yèpez is
the author of several books in Spanish writes for the Reforma newspaper
in Mexico City. Some of his writing in English has appeared in U.S.
magazines, including Tripwire, Shark and XCP. He has performed and read
at various U.S. conferences, including Poetry in a Time of Crisis at the
UC Santa Cruz, and the recent Cabinet of the Muses series, sponsored in
part by UC Berkeley and the LAB. You can find him online at
http://www.hyepez.blogspot.com/ and http://mexperimental.blogspot.com/

Murat,

there is much here i hadn't considered.  and i admit that my main concern was to clear Wittgenstein of any connection to the denial of the revolutionary potential of poetic language.   as I say below--sort of--what is missing from Wittgenstein's notion of language games is any sense of how the games change--at least from I what know.  I do think the notion of games allows one to explore the limits of those games, which may not turn out to be as impermeable as philosophers would like.  poetry does allow one to cross borders, but then chaos has taught us that limits are the very place of indeterminacy.  I am not sure why a contemporary poet would feel the need to abide by Wittgenstein, in any case.  His is but another language game.  Thus my turn to Shelley and his Defense, specifically to where he says of poets:

"Their language is vitally metaphorical; that is it marks the before unapprehended relations of things, and perpetuates their apprehension, until the words which re present them become through time signs for portions and classes of thoughts, instead of pictures of integral thoughts; and then, if no new poets should arise to create afresh the associations which have been thus disorganized, language will be dead to all the nobler purposes of human intercourse."

This is not "liberation," but resurrection.  Shelley always has in mind his own christian Platonism, although he undermines it as well--the poetic capacity is but a fading coal, ashes--so you cannot charge him with idealism pure and simple.  At the same time, this is a manifesto or an exhortation.  It is not philosophy, it is not trying to patrol or discover borders.

A final word:  Shelley's quote about the unacknowledged legislators is a classic, but the preceding formulation at the end is at once more extreme (in its suggestion of power) but also more disturbing.

"Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration, the mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present, the words which express what they understand not, the trumpets which sing to battle and feel not what they inspire: the influence which is moved not, but moves."

poets here are turning into mere vessels, no more conscious of what moves them then anyone else.  if they are unacknowledge legislators, they themselves do not acknowledge that they are either.

>I am interested this, too, except that I think it is a blind alley, an instance of someone saying they have found the "ding-an-sich," or a cry to find it. To my mind, Wittgenstein did not consign poetry to an endless repetition of the so-called real.

What does he mean then by being caught like a fly in a box?
>
This seems to be how his mantra that philosophy nothing but therapy for the delusions it creates. In any case, that is a broad generalization about the project Philosophical Investigations, a work that was never finished, and in any case is not written in the consecutive and consequential style of the Tractatus.

By "consequential" do you mean important or logically connected?

The PI is a case of analysis interminable. It does, however, start with an explosion of Wittgenstein's previous work and much of western philosophy back to Descartes. He says that a picture had us bewitched. By saying that, he is saying good-bye to a correspondence theory of truth and naive representationalism, the bulwarks of the quest for certainty.

He is saying that language games are tautological. Because of that they are not about the world, They are illusions. But he himself is involved in a language game; that's why a fly in a box. Metaphysics (PI), a constant engine of tearing down of illusions through illusions.
>
>Instead, PI posits that language only can be understood as a game, or rather games. This does not mean that we are fully in charge or cognizant and--perhaps this is not Wittgenstein--the games don't change and evolve, "

What does exactly "evolve" mean? Does the "old" inherently contain everything in the "new" or doesn't it? If it does not, then the system is not closed. If it does, then nothing "new" (therefore nothing) is being said.

"...as humans evidently do. But Wittgenstein does seem to believe that getting beyond games--in a way that is certain, rather than simply speculative--is impossible."

Yes, that's true. That's why he feels and senses caught like a fly. Wittgenstein makes empiricism (Locke, also the rationalizer of property) come face to face with its inherent contradictions (Marx). Tractatus and PI are works of empiricism in extremis. The real attack against this thinking does not come from Descartes but from Kant, Hegel, Heidegger, Benjamin, all believers in essences. The real attack on Wittgenstein, etal, is not that words have pictures which they represent; rather that, words (language) are part of a reality which they can not completely cover. Words and experience do not completely cover each other; they are not a perfect, tautological fit.

In attempts to cross that gap (distance, imperfect fit) that language renews itself.

"Now, if getting beyond the games is how poetry is to liberate language, well, I just don't get that. Language can never point to anything outside itself."

All you are saying is that you can not disagree with Wittgenstein.

"It is our reception of it and the full web of understanding that happens in a communicative that allows language to be a vehicle for meaning."

One can equally look at Wittgenstein's view of language as a tool with generates (can generate) no meaning.


>
>Why not simply go back to Shelley and his belief that poetry reanimates the language of the tribe?

What does Shelley have to do with Wittgenstein?

"It gives us new expressions and sometimes, with it, new experiences. But to look in a language or in poetry for certainty, that I am afraid is a delusion."

Who said one is looking at language for certainty. That's the point, it is full of uncertainty, insufficiency.

"It is exactly the picture that bewitches."

A good description of W.'s work, an attempt not to be bewitched which bewitches.


Ciao.

Leonard Peltier Scholarship at Oglala Lakota College

THREE-MILE CREEK SD - The Oglala Commemoration
Committee and Lakota Student Alliance is pleased to
introduce the Leonard Peltier Honorary Scholarship for incoming
freshmen at Oglala Lakota College. This scholarship will be awarded to
one student each year that has finished their General Equivalency
Diploma (GED) in good standing and plans to attend Oglala
Lakota College (OLC) to further their education.

The Award, in the amount of $250, is created in the
name of Leonard Peltier, Anishnabe activist and
acclaimed author of "Prison Writings: My Life is My
Sundance."

Only GED Graduates at Oglala Lakota College shall be
eligible to receive this scholarship. The applicant
(GED Graduate) must submit an application and Essay to
be considered by the Oglala Lakota College Scholarship Committee. The
Oglala Lakota College Scholarship Committee is authorized to select
the award recipient each year. The Oglala Commemoration Committee will
announce the Leonard Peltier Honorary Scholarship
recipient following the annual Oglala Commemoration
Event held each year in Oglala SD.

The Lakota Student Alliance and Oglala Commemoration Committee jointly
sponsor the Scholarship to honor and remember the lives lost during
the 1970's civil conflict on the reservation and to also raise
awareness toward the unjust imprisonment of AIM member Leonard Peltier,
currently jailed in Leavenworth Kansas.

Peltier's imprisonment resulted from answering a
distress call by Oglala Lakota Elders and victims of a
"Reign of Terror" ultimately resulting in a shooting
battle between AIM members and Federal Agents at the
Jumping Bull property.

The Elders called AIM for protection during the
historic 1970's era on Pine Ridge Reservation.
Lakota Student Alliance members hope this scholarship
will encourage GED graduates to further their
education  and gain powerful knowledge for the common good of the
Lakota Nation. The LSA realizes the tremendous
barriers that often lead to painful choices by many Lakota
Tribal students. The GED graduates of the Oglala
Lakota Nation are mostly Single Parents with little income.
These parents took the initiative to better themselves
for their homes, and their communities.

Applications for the Leonard Peltier Honorary
Scholarship will be made available at the Oglala
Lakota College Registrar's office as well as the local College
Center Branches. The scholarship application will also
be posted online at the Lakota Student Alliance and
the Oglala Commemoration Websites.

We wish future scholarship recipients good luck in
their educational endeavors.

The Leonard Peltier Honorary Scholarship is a result
of fundraising efforts conducted by the Oglala
Commemoration Committee and the Lakota Student
Alliance in conjunction with the annual Oglala Commemoration
Event. We intend to continue this scholarship annually
with the help of considerate donors and individuals.

Event, you can visit the website at http://www.oglalacommemoration.com

Robert Corbett, responding to Murat Nemet-Nejat wrote:

[snip] "what is missing from Wittgenstein's notion of language
games is any sense of how the games change--at least from I what
know.  I do think the notion of games allows one to explore the
limits of those games, which may not turn out to be as
impermeable as philosophers would like."  [snap]

With the game metaphor it's important to remember that it's
backed up by the 'family resemblances' concept.  That is, a way
of grouping similar things without relying on 'essences.' Also i
could be wrong, but don't think Wittgenstein EVER flat out said
that language was a game or even that any particular person's or
people's language was a game.  He thought of the idea of
'language games' to model certain aspects of language.

My sense of Wittgenstein's thinking is that it explains that
conceptual 'change' occurs because cognitive recognition or
rhetorical construction of resemblances can change, which
affects the boundary of a concept.  GAME changes because its
intension (the structure of resemblances) can change the
extension (things in the world you call a "game") and vice
versa.  A particular new activity is invented and it changes
what exists in the world, and what we call a "game."  I think
the *source* of this kind of change is really well illustrated
in section IIxi of the Philosophical Investigations, where he
explores the idea of the organization of perceptions: of seeing
aspects and aspect change (Shelley's "before unapprehended
relations of things").

Shelley was wrong to ascribe only to poetry a vital metaphoric
prerogative.  ALL language is "vitally metaphorical."  Daily
speech ("time passes") and even scientific language ("electrons
orbit the nucleus"), especially at the edge.  There's a great
(apocryphal?) story about Heisenberg and Bohr washing dishes
together at a guys-only quantum physics retreat high in the
Swiss Alps.  Heisenberg turns to Bohr and says, "Our language is
like this dishwater.  Even though it's dirty we manage to get
the dishes clean."  Or something to that effect.  He meant that
while they had math equations to work out theories in, they
still needed language to describe the world.  The metaphoric
strength of language ('waves of light' 'particles of matter')
was breaking down for them because the "contradictions" that
their math was revealing described reality better than classical
mechanics, which all their descriptive language was based on.
But somehow, metaphoric neologisms ('wavicle') with a little
sense of humor ('quarks' 'colored quarks' and 'quantum
chromodynamics'), helped them understand how to interpret the
math.

I think it's important not to assign poets (or philosophers) a
role that requires them to have an essential difference,
capacity, insight, etc from everybody else.  Conversely i think
it's important to allow that the growth, renewal and even
corrosion of language is brought about by many types of
interlocking uses of language.

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT

KEEPING IT SIMPLE/LOOKING FOR THE LIGHT =AD PATRICIA SPEARS JONES
TUESDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 22ND
"The quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives has direct bearing
upon the product which we live...It is within this light that we form those
ideas by which we pursue our magic and make it realized. This is poetry as
illumination." =AD from =B3Poetry is Not a Luxury=B2 by Audre Lorde. =B3This is a
poetry workshop that takes the poetry of illumination to mean the poetry of
experience. How we scrutinize, how we elucidate our lives through words and
rhythms, how we make our poems bring new ways of thinking about our lives.
We will focus on the basics: line, stanza, cadence, meter, diction, syntax,
and point of view -=AD the elements that make a poem. We will also read
contemporary poets including Audre Lorde, Maureen Owen, Amy Gerstler, Shara=
n
Strange, Lee Young Lee, Jeanne Marie Beaumont, Frank O'Hara, Lorenzo Thomas=
,
and Bob Kaufman.=B2 Patricia Spears Jones is an award-winning poet and
playwright, and author of The Weather That Kills. Students must have

FINDING THE & THEN SOME THERE THERE =AD MERRY FORTUNE
THURSDAYS at 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 24TH
Film of Dreyer, writing of Mayer, painting of Traylor. An identifiable poet
=B3voice=B2 is a desirable, comfortable and utilitarian achievement. But what
potential or beautiful mystery lurks beyond carefully cultivated form,
tendency, technique, habit and boundary. Exploring the processes, qualities
and aesthetics of all art forms we will collectively discover commonalities=
,
and fearlessly apprehend what we may learn to expand our poetic values and
vocabularies as well as our very minds. Merry Fortune is the author of
Ghosts By Albert Ayler, Ghosts By Albert Ayler (Futurepoem).

HYPNOSIS AND CREATIVITY =AD MAGGIE DUBRIS
FRIDAYS AT 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 25TH
=B3Hypnotic and trance states have been used for centuries by shamans, mystic=
s
and visionaries. In this five week workshop, we will study techniques for
self-hypnosis that allow a writer to easily access the creative flow state.
We will explore the use of hypnotic tools to generate images, to increase
creative focus, to switch gears from a day job into writing, and to
circumvent creative blocks. We will also discuss the use of hypnosis to
vividly recall memories, and its use in conjunction with other creative
tools such as automatic writing.=B2 A $20 materials fee covers four of
Dubris=B9s hypnosis CDs, three of which are specifically geared to writing.
Maggie Dubris is the author of Skels (Soft Skull Press 2004), and Weep Not,

POETRY AND MUSIC =AD DREW GARDNER
FRIDAYS at 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN APRIL 8TH
=B3A workshop investigating the relation of music and poetry, comparing the
languages of poetry and music and asking questions about how they can be
combined and how they might illuminate each other. What are the poetic
implications of improvisation? What are the musical implications of everyda=
y
speech? What does our experience of poetry imply about how we experience
sound and how does our listening affect our writing? We will read and liste=
n
to Harry Partch, Morton Feldman, Leo Smith, Pauline Oliveros, Thoreau,
Nathaniel Mackey and others, keep listening notebooks and collaborate with
guest musicians. No musical background required.=B2 Drew Gardner is the autho=
r

featuring poetry and structured improvisation.


A LAB: POST-CONCEPTUAL POETRIES =AD ROBERT FITTERMAN
SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN FEBRUARY 26
=B3What happens when we ask ourselves not if the poem =B3could have been done
better, but whether it could have been done otherwise=B2 (Dworkin). In
post-conceptual writing, the expression is realized in the process. This
workshop will be a hands-on writing lab. Each week we will write poems
in-class generated by borrowed models from contemporary, 21st Century
poetry. Some of these experiments might include: sampling, bastardization,
procedural writing, mixed media, collaboration, etc.=B2 Robert Fitterman is

What's more odd to me has been Ron's silence on that matter. Was he
hacked/spammed or in honest favor of the email's message & sentiment?
This is what I find intriguing. I checked to see if Silliman's Blog
was down, and from all appearances, it's jugging right along. As for
the violent and hate-filled sentiment and message of that email, I
find them very believable in this "culture" of ours. --Ak

Capture the rapture of mother nature
Beyond Africa, Pan Pacifica, Antarctica to South America
Health before wealth in the kingdom of righteous
Fight until death do us part and I might just
Travel to the depth of the heart of Atlantis
Pledge to the state of the art so I plan this
Expedition as my mission all the while
Competition lose not knowing why
Til the day I chill in the east of the River Nile
Real skill, real deal never go out of style yeah



Who wanna test their blackness?
Let me guess, fake jocks frontin' like Loch Ness
Life blessed you to look the best
When you're dressed with less but cover the rest
Some kids with straight strands want dread locks
Some girls with a fro want to straighten their chops
It's all good we all grow out of it just like hair-do
You gotta vibe and flow with it just like air do

'Round the globe youth carry the hope
That one day everything's gonna be just fine now
Press rewind to a world color blind
Zero complex, find a space all mine
I grew up on the East Coast, opposite of Ivory
In the 21st, reckon economic slavery

Beyond Africa, Latin America, through Jamaica back to Japonica
Man and machine make the money that manipulate
Mind over matter meaning make moves to motivate
Before we globalize commercially
We need to mobilize community to spread the music with mercy
'Cuz exploitation is the blast from the past

Conversation help future visions last
Til the day I fill the post I'm supposed to live by
Real skill, real deal never go out of style yeah



Black is beautiful to me

Respect all state, all color, all race

Black is beautiful to me

One love, one god, one mind, one heart



INI, You and I, realize U-N-I-T-Y

INI, You and I, realize U-N-I-T-Y

Wow, is this a joke?  I downloaded that amazing little vid of Ashcroft's
inspiring performance, but I can't believe people take this stuff seriously.
You see my limitation.

I wonder what the difference is between "political correctness" and
"righteousness"?

Are you considering emigration, Pierre?

All the best

Abuse After Aristide's Ouster:
Less Than A Year After Former Haiti President Was Run Out, Observers Say U.S.
Sponsored Terror Has "Again Launched A Tsunami Of Oppression Against
Haitians":
By READ HEARSAY


They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

As I posted last year there's an alarming, "serious" groundswell of bcking
for the "Alabama God-Damn"
Judge Moore. And he's quite prolific. And... from
those who follow this sort of thing-- there's a book dure out soon.

But, please, if we must go this route, what about J.C., the man from Plains.
At least this dreadful poet would be (in many ways) an anathama to many...

... and then there's MacLiesh...

Cheers,

Cage is clearly a great thinker poet artist musician - but -  just talking
of his famous silence omits what I think - from my limited knowledge of his
work - what seems to be his accomplishment - is interest in chance plus his
ideas including that music move beyond the "organised"  or predetermined etc
and that idea of his that involves very much his audience - but of course as
in the problematic "death of the author concept (as Alan eg comments on and
there was a debate on the D of the A once on here before) Cage of course is
still  an individual  "author" behind his works- but ideas from his
works/philosophy etc include the idea of  feeling that one (the audience /
the  performers) can interprete music much more freely - can participate -
can appreciate being alive and listening -- as in jazz and indeed even in
Bach and Beethoven and all those guys - but more so - the idea that sounds
themselves of the 'real world' are incorporated - what is composed - what is
artifice - what's more beautiful or more interesting - sounds we hear  or
composed music?

"That's God " "A shout in the street" - is there any untimate silence - he
went into a soundless chamber  - I forget the term for it - but he realised
he couldn't "escape' sound - the mind creates sound - and  the involvement
of the audience -
interesting ideas by an innovative musician/writer etc

And Cage's ideas contributed to a degree of liberation  from the set - forms
etc - I don't understand it all but those are some  ideas  I get from
Cage...

 Silence can be terrifying and extraordinary beautiful.

And I heard a musician describing her performance of the
4' 33" and she had  to work on it very hard - not trivia - and Cage actually
'composed' the silent parts as well or as assiduoulsy as other composers
compose their
 music: it was constructed silence - composed silence - and he scored and
wrote tempus for the silence music - or at least he had bars etc carefuly
and assiduously composed silence.

funny, you'd think with a question like 'can poetry liberate
language?' there would be the following choices:
yes
no

I need help with this question: are the poems in _Cathay_ (1915) in the
public domain? My understanding was that anything published before 1923
falls into that category, and indeed there is a version of "Exile's
Letter" at
Bartleby.com. But it's from _The New Poetry: An Anthology_ (1917),
edited by Harriet Monroe, and differs from the version in _The
Translations of Ezra Pound_, still in print from New Directions.

To add to the confusion, I note that another of the _Cathay_ poems is at
the poets.org site, and it carries this notice: "Copyright C 1956, 1957
by Ezra Pound. Used with permission of New Directions Publishing
Corporation. All rights reserved. No part of this poem may be reproduced
in any form without the written consent of the publisher." That seems
fairly definitive.

Does anyone grok these subtleties?

Thanks in advance,
Rachel Loden

Hi,

arrested last night in Brazil. For more information, see the IndyMedia address

Breaking News: Homeless Camp in Brasil Raided, Two Killed, NYC IMC Volunteer
Arrested
by NYC IMC 16 Feb 2005
There is an English language translation of this story now available on
Global Indymedia. Update: According to a comment posted to the Global Indymedia
feature from CMI Brasil, "The two IMC volunters ... were taken to the Federal
Police where their equipement was taken by the police. They have a lawyer there
with them and they seemed to be ok." We are recieving reports from Indymedia
Brasil that Brasilian military police raided a homeless camp last night, killing
at least two members of the Homeless Movement. More than 800 people were
arrested, including NYC Indymedia reporter Brad Will. This is a breaking story.
For updates visit the Indymedia global and Brasil [pt] websites.

The point behind Cage's silent piano piece seems to be, however, that there is no silence.  Ambient noise from the audience is heard throughout.  Still, Cage was and is a great composer, even though he is now deceased.  Did you know, that his prepared piano innovations  , in fact, originate with Henry Cowell.  Not that the works so produced were not written by Cage but that the method of putting things on the strings originated with Cowell.

Yeah, ambient noise from the audience you get when you go to hear Webern,
too -- sometimes hard to hear the music for all the fidgeting noise.

(As for the putting things on strings thing, are you saying that Cage 'got
the idea from Cowell', i.e. in direct contact? Or merely that Cowell's
preparations preceded Cage's? I used to play around with the strings inside
our family piano long before I'd heard of either & no one gives me credit!)

"Besides studying with Weiss and Schoenberg, I had also studied with
Henry Cowell. I had often heard him play a grand piano, changing its
sound by plucking and muting the strings with fingers and hands. I
particularly loved to hear him play 'The Banshee.' To do this, Henry
Cowell first depressed the pedal with a wedge at the back (or asked
an assistant, sometimes myself, to sit at the keyboard and hold the
pedal down), and then, standing at the back of the piano, he produced
the music by lengthwise friction on the bass strings with his fingers or
fingernails, and by crosswise sweeping of the bass strings with the
palms of his hands. In another piece he used a darning egg, moving
it lengthwise along the strings while trilling, as I recall, on the keyboard;
this produced a glissando of harmonics."

Oh, Cage is still very much alive... This from a 2001 BBC article:

The John Cage Project launched what they claim will be the world's=20
longest musical recital.

  Organ2/ASLSP is due to be performed on the town organ in Halberstadt=20=

in northern Germany over a decidedly leisurely 639 years.

  Apparently some 360 spectators, paid DM30 (UK=A310) to see the =
recital's=20
organist inflate his instrument's bellows and they'll have to come back=20=

in another 18 months time in order to hear him play the first chord -=20
and one each year or so thereafter.

  Providing that sponsors can be found, the performance is scheduled to=20=

reach its finale in 2640, with a half time interval planned in 2319.

Time

  Although Cage originally wrote ASLSP in 1992 as a 20-minute piece for=20=

piano, for many years musicologists have deliberated over just how=20
slow, as slow as possible really is.

  Whilst purists have argued that time is infinite, the John Cage Organ=20=

Foundation agreed on the figure of 639 years to correspond with the=20
number of years since the construction of Germany=92s first block single=20=

organ.

  The performance has been presented as the ultimate antidote to a fast=20=

paced world. As organiser, Michael Betzle, has explained:

  =91The long period of time is supposed to form a contrast to the=20
breathless pace of change in the modern-day world.=92

  It is certainly very slow, but as music critic Michael White, explains=20=

this is not necessarily how John Cage intended the music to be=20
performed:



=91It is in the spirit of John Cage=85 he was an outrageous character, =
in a=20
sense, he was the emperor of the avant-garde.=92

  =91His whole life was spent creating events and happenings=85 they =
were=20
meant for you to go away and think about some principal or=20
philosophical idea that each piece embodied and reflected.=92

Life and laughs

  When asked about his thoughts on death, John Cage famously replied:

  =91That's a mystery the solution of which interests me very much.=92

  Unless his music enables the audience to cheat death, it is extremely=20=

unlikely that anyone will witness the entire live performance.

  Organiser, Michael Betzle, has even said:

  =91I am 57 years old. I have to accept the distinct possibility that I=20=

shall die before the concert is over.=92

  So what does ASLSP signify? Is there any point in staging a concert=20
that even the organisers will never hear?

  =46rom Michael White=92s point of view, there are always lessons to be=20=

learned from Cage performances. He explains:

  =91I think Cage was a con-man, but he was a con man who stumbled on =
some=20
brilliant truths and was able to make use of them.=92

  'I met him a few times and he was funny and able to laugh at himself.=20=

It wasn=92t that he didn=92t take what he was doing seriously, he did, =
but=20
he thought that there was a joke in everything.'

  'I think people who grasp some deep truths about life are able to look=20=

at life and see how funny it is.=92

Dear Chicago area poetry friends.

My hipster friend Andy and I need a place to stay in downtown Chicago
Saturday and Sunday night.  We are both funny and would bring our own
sleeping bags.   Please advise.

I mean, we could go on Priceline, but who really has $50 a night?

Is Chicago International Hostel worth trying?

You're hanging with the wrong crowd. Like Ives said on another occasion,
"Stand up and use your ears like a man."

But hell, there are people who fidget at readings of poetry they consider
difficult.

I took a class from Cowell at Columbia in 1963. He performed some of his
pieces played on the interior of the piano for us. He also demonstrated for
us some of Cage's innovations. Cage was his student.

It's curious - and I think an old tactic of the right - to put this Ashcrof=
t
aspiration into the public sphere. It has a way of focusing and draining
energies away from paying attention to real work and the people and
processes that make poetry real.  Brings up memories of local, consuming
debates in the mid-seventies about whether or not Rod McKuen - Stanyan
Street Poems, multiple million copy seller - was a real poet, and whether o=
r
not Lewis McAdams should have invited Mckuen to read at the SF State Poetry
Center. Which he did. The whole thing many of us found an energy suck and
refused to go to the event. McKuen is a forgotten footnote now. Such,
hopefully, will not be the case of those Arabs and Arab-Americans unjustly
jailed and tortured under Ashcroft as Attorney General.
I think it is a good time turn one's back and refuse to publicly acknowledg=
e
the Ashcroft prospect - like Pierre not shaking hands with Chirac -
particularly if he is so chosen. Jesus!

For gawds sake, a few minutes of the push-button
research that is now so very easy shows that this
Ashcroft thing comes from a satirical website called
The Swift Report which includes delicisous stories
like
"Bush: Banning Gay Marriage Could Cut Deficit in Half"
& something about Ann Coulter once having been a man.

well then no if the answer has to be one word.

i have been reading Isaiah Berlin and should have said
so, since my Wittgenstein is old and perhaps a little
suspect (though he is still the Man, after the
Nietzsche, for me).  Berlin has an interesting claim
about philosophy or several related claims.

1) philosophy has no method, despite the fact that
some philosophers become methodized.  anything that is
overly mechanical is destroyed or given over to
science; anything that is overly deductive or formal
is given over to logic and mathematics.  philosophy is
a practice and you can only learn by working with the
practictioners (a game if you will).

2) philosophy develops in two ways:  1) through
reformulating the questions themselves, so what were
apparent problems become problems no longer; 2)
through destruction of an existing system -- Kant's
destruction of naive empiricism or Nietzsche's
destruction of Hegelian metaphysics.

He is better than Rorty because Richard is not
historical is thinking about philosophy.  He thinks
that once a metaphor is dead, it is dead.  Berlin
knows it can be resurrected (making him strangely
closer to Derrida).

Finally (and perhaps this is his repetition of
Wittgenstein), he says that philosophical problems
causes "mental agony."  That is why it is frustrating
that there is no "method" to philosophy and that is
why sometimes the acolytes destroy their predecessor's
work (as Wittgenstein did unto Russell's logical
atomism).

None of which is to the point, but I do think it would
be interesting to substitute "poetry" for philosophy
here.  Is there a "method" to poetry?  Do poets
destroy the "methods" that precede them?

And yes poetry cannot liberate langugage.  But why
give one or the other priority over them.

And no, not all language is "vitally" metaphorical.
All is metaphorical but if computer manuals was
written like the Triumph of Life--well they would be
better reading but even less helpful than they are
now.  Shelley is not naive about his _language_, so
don't you be either.

Ah David, I never knew you were such a quirky fellow -- and still are as
is plain to see.  I should have known by "Estrella's Prophecies" but I
thought "Ah that's just poetry," making the mistake so many have made of
imagining distinction between
the poetry & the mind.

Royalties will not be difficult to keep track of, as you will be
publishing the book.

You need not worry about the stress-mark.  I have absorbed it into the
body of my name.  People I think highly of use it in email; I myself do
not, unless I am thinking highly of myself that day.  Please do not
bother yourself to think any more stress into my name: you know I think
I can feel it: it is a rare mixture of courtesy and strain,
maybe like a man with a toothache holding open a door for a lady with
too much fur sweeping through or ... no, I will not pursue that image.
But a very sweet wrestling with the accent nevertheless.  David you
should hear how I pronounce Baratier you grenadier, you bereted tier,
you barette of a dear, barista of my atelier, breath of day.  I have
sewn a small flock of starlings into it for you, they look like
circumflexes, with transparent thread.

And for the information of anyone who feels he or she could establish a
warm & cheering relationship with me if only he/she could pronounce my
name, it's
marade, rhyming with parade, charade, afraid.  The Irish for Margaret.

Thanks for the poem. I have thoroughly enjoyed our Oatmealee.
I hope you will dispense royalties, per word or per page
for my part when this appears in your next book.

Second, I might owe you an apology,
it is not that I do not know your name
but there is an intentional mispelling each time I write it.
I have been thinking a stress-mark into the e-mail
just before I send it  and since you have not said anything
I thought it might be working but I wanted to be clear.

THE PARAPROFESSIONAL

A priest, a lawyer, and a paraprofessional were stranded on an island.

The priest prayed, the lawyer gathered firewood, and the paraprofessional
sat in my classroom in the desk behind a kid that had Aspergers Syndrome.



NON VERBAL LEARNING DISABILITY

Maria Deutschmann is ignoring me.
Maybe she  has a non-verbal learning disability.
Hey Maria. Yo.
See? She has no inner voice to restrain her from base instincts.



MYELIN

I can't tell you how to relate to others.
I don't have the answers, and you know it.
All I can tell you is that nobody fits a single definition perfectly.
Also, I have no myelin coating on my nerves  to restrain me
    from base instincts.
Stop triggering my responses, because I can't control them. Thanks.



BASE INSTINCTS

One time there was a powerpoint about base instincts.
Beforehand, the presenter warned us to assume nothing.



ASSUME NOTHING

These students have an extremely high tolerance for pain.
Whereas normal students may respond positively to mild chastisement,
Maybe you'd want to stab one of these students in the hand.
If you laugh or say anything afterward, that would be a trigger.



CALM

Jessica is walking to class.
She walks through a freshly painted hallway.
This becomes a "trigger" and confuses Jessica.
She ends up at Starbucks.



REALITY THERAPY

Reality therapy is very simple.
Everyone can incorporate it into their work.
It helps develop the inner voice so critical to normal life.
The first question is, "What do you want?"
The second question is, "What do you really want?"
The key to reality therapy is discovering
how to help others get the things they need.
Once this key is established, the questions become,
"What are you doing?" and "Is it working?"
The final step is to develop a "plan":
Simple, specific, positive, immediate, commitment.




+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Dear Mark Weiss-

The above are my attempt at therapy poetry.  Or poetry therapy.  I am not a
big huge fan of the poets listed at the poetry therapy convention, so I
believe you and I should take this movement by the horns and steer it in
another direction.

For a start, let's try to get them to take the word Poetry out of Poetry
therapy.

Yours are nice, tho. I hope they help you deal with your conflicts.

Artists who don't work in media where interpretive artists are
usually necessary for an audience to experience the work (those who
aren't, for example, composers, choreographers or playwrights) often
have skewed ideas about what was important about Cage was doing. Cage
wasn't interested in performers doing whatever they wanted to - he
wanted them to play the works on the scores in front of them. Cage
was far more interested in composers being able to make whatever they
wanted to however they wanted to, regardless of how difficult it
might be for a musician to perform the resulting works.

There's really VERY little evidence that Cage had much interest in
any idea of "the Death of the Author" and he had VERY little interest
in improvisation as such or audience participation. What little
interest he may have had in these things does not seem to be
reflected in the music that he composed.

Cage's use of chance techniques was as a way to avoid falling into
his own compositional habits of taste and self-expression, also, he
wanted to create works that didn't simply fall into the performing
habits of musicians. Once a score was completed, however, Cage
expected that musicians would reproduce their parts as they were
written, and he was always quite upset whenever performers took
liberties with his notated scores.

There WAS a relatively brief period in the 1960s when Cage created a
few works (maybe as many as ten out of nearly 300 compositions) that
were little more than sets of materials with which a musicians or
ensemble were to develop their own scores using various random
manipulations, but even in these cases, Cage expected the resulting
scores to be followed exactly rather than ignored by performers
improvising in real-time.

If anything, he seemed to have even less patience for audience
members who chose to do their own thing in response to a work, rather
than just being open to hearing what was performed.

One of Cage's frequently quoted bon mots was "Permission granted; but
not to do what you want."

>of the audience -
>interesting ideas by an innovative musician/writer etc

When Cage was in the anechoic chamber, his mind DIDN'T create sounds
where there were no sounds. Rather he heard the actual sounds of his
body in operation, sounds which are usually masked by the ambient
sounds of the world around us: the low-pitched blood pulsing through
his veins and the high-pitched sound of his nervous system. Some
people might also hear the various sounds created by tinnitus in such
a situation.

4'33" is in three sections; the first section is 30"; the second
section is 2'23" & the final section is 1'40". Demarking these
sections clearly in performance is as difficult for a musician as
maintaining performing concentration while not playing the instrument
they've spent years working on.

As I note elsewhere, ambient sounds come from the surroundings
regardless of the behavior of any members of the audience. And they
can just as easily come from non-fidgeting audience members who are
entirely focused and attentive on the work at hand, whatever that may
be.

I read recently  that the women in the Yoshiwara sometimes tattooed their
favorite haiku along with the name of their chief patron on certain
parts of their bodies.  This intrigued me so much that I thought I'd
enlist the help of the list concerning the idea of worn poetry/text.
Please participate by telling us, specifically, what poem/text you would
have tattooed on your body, and exactly where on your body you would
tattoo the poem/text in question.  Poems can be in any language, and any
length and of course any part of the anatomy is fair game.  Oh yes, and
you could tell us why you would place the poem where you would place it.

Instances of tattoo poetry/text from history, or popular culture would be
appreciated.  If you're really game you could text yourself and tell us
about it.  It might make an interesting addition to a future ahadada
book.

check out cowell's complete piano music one disc's worth  on folkways he
plays it himself and explains but there are also some great interpreters
of it

ah a woman who's name now escapes me on finadar

cowell also "invented" the tone cluster

elbow to hand on keyboard

i first saw that done in the 60's by cecil taylor  whom at 76 is still
beyond amazing
caught his trio last night and going back for the big band tonight

cowell was  also gay as was cage  and as is taylor
tho in cowell's time he was denounced and jailed for it
and supporters like ives abandoned him
lou harrision i believe also studied with cowell
cage eventually said he didn't like what shoenberg was about
nor beethoven (i think)  and tho he was into chance operations ( a form
of improvisation )
he disliked jazz

Fiction writer Shelley Jackson's "novel"- I think it is called "Skin": she's
recruited people to each sport 1 word of the text on their body as tattooed
text/symbol (ampersand, etc.). 1000 people or something are doing this; the
project is nearly complete.

This is another off-the-point discussion or really the beginning of a new thread, but I have provoked by some of the more dogmatic utterances here about what poetry IS.  I think practitioners have a certain investment in saying what it _is_ and saying some forms are out of bounds.  To a large degree, this is what the so-called new formalists do, and to a lesser degree, the LP and post-LP folks do.  (Sorry, David Lehman, but you are just flat out wrong about the Last Avante-Garde.)  We seem to have a rising generation that resists such statements, but there remains a distinct emphasis on method as synomous with poetry--at least poetry that matters.  (It is a peculiarity of our moment that the most radically formalist movement, LP, is thought of a formless by certain algorithms in the reviewing machine.  The neo-formalists themselves should be called the Old Formalists, just as the New Critics were nothing but Johnson with a few misunderstood premises from Coleridge.  "Just
 representations of general nature" covers the unexceptional work of both schools and misunderstood Coleridge gets you to the autotelic moment (subtly Christian) which has degraded into the dreaded epiphany of the final line.)

Berlin proposes that philosophy has no essential method and that it sloughs off as unnecessary two different kinds of labor:  roughly the construable by experiment or observation, or the deductive by formal logic (starting with logic and mathematics and reading up into physics, though at the rarer altitudes there, there may be philosophy).  The reasoning is that philosophy is simply what is the case and you only know by doing it and doing it in community (so the ranting of the Unabomber or the Imam or the Libertarian are not philosophy).  Think about it:  what is the _subject_ of philosophy?  Or better, where does it start and where does it end?   Not here:  other minds discussions can take place on Mars.  Note to pragmatists:  this is a more vigorous definition of philosophy, because y'all are too eager to render its work back into social policy or engineering or natural science or literature.  It is in the Sellarsian tradition of "philosophy is, in general, how things hang
 together."  Berlin, too, as historian of philosophy (but also a conceptual innovator, which is how Deleuze defines the work of philosophy), is conscious of the embeddedness of philosophic discourse and how it resistance (mental agony, for Berlin, creates the need for new philosophy) can bring about rebellion.  This allies him with Derrida and Freud.

So under the influence of Berlin (ich bin berliner for the moment), I want to ask, how does Poetry compare to this definition of philosophy?  And does defining Poetry this way solve or make go away the anxious question about what it does to language?    I think it does and yet it does in a way that does delegitimate other definitions, presumably local. (I'll say more on that score in another email.)

The next installment will be a healthy selection of Berlin on philosophy as a-methodical.  After that I will try to specify in more detail how poetry, in its way, is also a-methodical.   I don't think of this a critical therapy (fortunately, criticism is mostly about what something means and what are its effects, so not recuperable by therapy community) but I do think it will help relieve anxiety and promote clear thinking.

I am well aware of the point - or that point re ambient sound - there are
others as everyone agrees - he was great generator of  ideas -
but also Charles Ives's father experimented with the prepared piano in the
19th century - I am no expert on music - but I was reading a book on modern
music and Cowell was discussed - I looked him up and indeed he was an
original -but I also like Ives's concepts his mixing of sounds -popular and
so-called classical - and the sheer energy of his music...and back to his
father - once he let a certain John Bell sing out of tune as the main thing
was the 'spirit' or gusto in the man  - there was no "correct" music - it
was the joy of it , the conceptual aspect, the ideas - strange that in theUS
Ives was neglected so much (or for so long)  - he epitomizes the so-called
American dream - but this is always the case (I don't care that he bcame a
multimillionnaire - good on him)  - the major innovators are either attacked
or neglected or  are actually in danger...under the surface of US Capitalism
we have a new-Stalinist-Breznevian-McCarthyist [some strange configuration]
America waiting to be born - in more or less subtle changed form - with
Rumsford and Ashcroft writing all the poetry - Rice doing all the music and
so on ....

jesse thnx for posting this fun topic. i hope others respond.

however much i like having text penned on my skin, i don't think i'd ever
get a tattoo of a poem/text but i really dig it on others.  i guess i'm
cautious about definition outlasting its assigned ephemera (me). that being
said, i do have a character tattoo on my write wrist - it's the name,
however tongue in cheek, of the protagonist in my Magnus Opium. & sometimes
i'm dubitable about, like, vodou invocation or servitude &tc but then shake
it away. it's small enough i can tear it out with my teeth if i must.

 how 'bout you? seems i haven't met many poets with tattoos, now that i
think of it. certainly not like musicians or artists.  at least a couple
poets on this list have tattoos that i know of, ahem, but i don't remember
whole texts.

Say it isn't so, Joe!

From Saturday's London Independent:

Hubble scientists compared with artists of Old West

Images of stars and galaxies taken by the Hubble space telescope fall into
the Romantic landscape tradition that inspired the "America sublime" artists
of the 19th century.


"An art historian has found similarities in the way American painters
depicted the beauty of the Old West with the subjective decisions made by
the astronomers to form Hubble pictures.

The Hubble records optical images but the colours have to be processed from
black-and-white pictures with filters sensitive to different frequencies of
the spectrum. But astronomers trying to depict space as realistically as
they can have to make subjective choices on contrast, composition and
colour, Elizabeth Kessler, of the University of Chicago, told the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.

"The Hubble images are part of the Romantic landscape tradition" she said,
pioneered by the likes of Moran and Albert Bierstadt.

David DeVorkin, of the Smithsonian Institution, said: "Just as 19th-century
artists accompanied ... exhibitions to persuade of the greatness of the
West, the space telescope images are doing that for space."

Actually ambient noise from everywhere and everything (whether it's
an HVAC system or a train going by) is heard throughout. There's no
need for an audience (or for that matter, any easily audible ambient
sounds) for the piece to work.

Cage did get the idea of altering the piano from Cowell during a
period in which he was writing only music for percussion ensembles.
Cage was asked to make a piece for a dance performance on a stage too
small to fit percussionists and dancer. Cowell's alterations of the
piano's sound inspired Cage to think of ways that a single performer
in a relatively small space could play a wide array of percussive
sounds. However, what each of these 2 composer did with and/or to the
piano was significantly different.

Cowell didn't affix anything to specific spots amidst the strings of
a piano. His inside the piano works require the performer to
manipulate objects (or the player's bare hands)  across and along the
strings. In these works, the general shape of the sound is under
control of the pianist, but the detailed components of each sound
might be quite different from performance to performance, depending
on the exact places that are struck or stroked on the strings.

In Cage's piano preparations, he provides detailed instructions about
exactly where on the piano's strings particular objects (strips of
rubber, bolts, etc) should be placed. Ideally, striking the same note
on a prepared piano's keyboard will always result in exactly the same
sound. For what it's worth, Cage's notations about where to insert
various objects inside a piano don't take into account the varying
string lengths of different sized instruments, so there can be
extreme differences in the actual sounds heard in performances using
different pianos.

So yeah, Cowell influenced Cage, and it's very unlikely that Cage
would have developed the prepared piano without knowing of Cowell's
work, but Cowell didn't do anything like what Cage did when he
prepared pianos.

It's not so bad, Tim. I have a one-line poem tattooed on my right shoulder.
Written by myself:
YOU OTTER LOSE
and there's a picture of an otter, smiling. Looks like he just caught a
fish, the lucky guy LRSN

Great post. How do you demark it on a recording?  I imagine
Zappa on his performance lighting a cigarette at the beginning,
taking a loud drag/exhale at :30, and 2:23 and stubbing it out
at the end.

Been trying.  Shelley isn't naive, but that quote is just biased
in its emphasis.  It took til 1980 and "Metaphors We Live By" by
George Lakoff (who was advertised here recently) and Mark
Johnson before even linguists had good tools to acknowledge the
deeply systematic use of metaphor in daily language, not to
mention professional argot. Check it: just listen to how you
express yourself moment to moment -- even 'express yourself' is
rooted in metaphor!  There is vitality in the creation of novel
metaphors based on 'family resemblances' to old ones.  But after
centuries of the sedimentary accretion and elaboration of these
kinds of tropes in literature, Dada, Lang-Po, Vis-Po or punkier
aleatory or procedural work says: fuck that!  Another kind of
linguistic vitality. I don't think it's an accident that
Surrealism and Wittgenstein's analysis of grammar came at the
same time.  They're both trying new rhetoric to get out from
under that weight.  Cage too for that matter.

Maybe it's not such a big deal, but i think it's not helpful to
define poetry (or poets), as opposed to other activities, as
having an *essential* efficacy in changing language.  A handy
counter-example seemed to be scientific language, which
ultimately alters language to deal with its non-linguistic
discoveries. Of course this doesn't mean poets aren't more aware
of banging their heads against the wall of language. Expressing
a powerful evanescant experience is different than explaining an
equation.  The good "W" might have said, there are limits
captured in our grammar.  His "Grammar" ultimately should
include, as much as word order, declension and case agreement,
systematic metaphorical constructions (such as those pointed out
by Lakoff and Johnson), which even find their way into the best
poets' work.

I've always been upset... I remember that day I was walking in the woods
with you and we came upon the bodies. We didn't know what to do! I thought
to myself, God must be terrific to let me find these bodies! We kneeled
and prayed. A great light filled the forest clearing, and we heard a voice
telling us to put our hands up and leave the crime scene. In no time at
all, we were jailed. Later the famous lawyer, Normal Siegel, freed us. At
this point we are celebrities, and that's why I'm here. Think of me as
"the guy who found the bodies in the woods" and you will have a good time!

Subject:      Japanese Women, tattoos, Yakusa and the word "Jap"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

One morning I was riding the train to work in Ogori, Kyushu.  It was
about 9 o'clock and we were heading into the countryside.  (I used to
work at a woman's college that was quite literally surounded by rice
fields.)  Anyway, this rather attractive lady--about 30 years old I'd
say--was nodding off in her seat almost opposite me.  She was wearing
slacks and the right pant leg rode up as she leaned back in the seat and
nodded.  She had a tattoo that began somewhere in her shoe and flowered
over her ankle and up.  It was a complete tattoo, from what I could see.
 Evidently this woman was a Yakusa "wife," but she was taking care to
keep her tattoo covered--as mostly everyone does in the countryside.
Even the guys.  Not so with two of my women students at Meikai
university.  One lady had a rather dramatic black dragon tattooed to her
left shoulder blade and another had a small read and white floral
pattern on her neck.  Both of these women openly displayed their
tattoos.  This could be because Tokyo is not Japan but another planet
entirely where the usual kata do not apply.  So, Steve, tell your wife
that tattoos openly displayed by Japanese women happen but are pretty
rare.  The two students I speak of are the first I've seen in 13 years
of being here.

The Yakusa are pretty scary.  I had a wonderful student--again in
Kyushu--who was working a part time job at a small supermarket in Ijiri,
when a Yakusa thug (they call them Chimpira), rolled back his sleeve in
the check-out line, revealed his tattoo and demanded a discount.  My
student was the check-out lady, and when she hesitated, this person
began to shout abuse at her.  A high school boy who worked as a bagger
there tried to tell this idiot to back off and the thug began to thrash
this young man.  The manager was alerted and when he came downstairs
from his office the thug looked up and threatened him, his business, and
everyone who worked at the supermarket.  He then picked up the groceries
without paying for them, laughed in their faces and walked out.  The
young man was sent to the hospital for his bravery and no police were
called.  That's the Yakusa.

Chinese actresses playing the part of Japanese women is pretty common.
It even happens in Japan.

Finally, Steve, I have a hard time with the word Jap, as I'm married to
a womderful woman from Nagasaki prefecture and have two wonderful
children who absolutely don't deserve such a slur.  Don't apply it to
the women and children, because they don't deserve it. Save it for the
Yakusa men, Steve.  They'd know exactly how to answer you.  Jesse Glass

Jesse,
No titles, no poems...no tattoos for me.  But I loved the tale of the =
train ride and the details of the young chap standing up to the Yakusa =
thug.=20

 As for the slur word, Jap, I confess, I'm confused.  What exactly is it =
that makes saying, "Japanese" acceptable and saying "Jap" unacceptable?=20

I do know that during the war, and for the first ten years or so =
following the war, literature, film, and journalistic commentary =
shortened the word to "Jap."  And I remember as a youth in 1945, 6, 7, =
etc, using the word, "Jap" to mean the enemy...but I've no recollection =
of reading, hearing, or using the word in the way or manner one might =
have used the word, "nigger" to denigrate a race.   If you get a moment, =
I'd appreciate hearing your views on what exactly makes the shortening =
of the word offensive.=20

As a frame of reference, Scottish and Scot aren't offensive in either =
form of the word; why is Japanese ok and Jap not? =20
Thanks,=20

Actually, that's not true, or not quite.

(Leave aside one is an adjective and the other is a noun, so "Scot" isn't a
shortened version of "Scottish" -- I am a Scot so I must be Scottish.)

While Scottish and Scot are quite OK, "Scotch" isn't.

There are only three things which can be legitimately termed "Scotch" --
whisky, terriers, and porridge.

Add to this, Jerrold, when it comes to *directed* offense, if you're a
left-handed Glasgwegian, being described as a cack-handed keelie ...

            <g>

There's an odd argument kicking around here (cis-Atlantic) as to the
legitimacy of the term "Asian".

Partly because the word (in some circles) is seen as a colonial coinage,
more cogently because it manages to conflate Chinese, Japanese, Hindu, Sikh,
and Muslim.

        Whatever happened to the sweet particularity of people?

I'm with you in that Japanese is K, Jap is invariably offensive.

Not quite as bad as nigger, but on the edge of the same territory.

(My daughter is even more rigid than me when it comes to this, which can be
a problem given that Loughborough in the East Midlands of England is
possibly the most homophobic and racist spot in the UK, so Catherine seems
to spend much of her time biting her tongue and swearing under her breath at
the casual racism/homophobia of her friends.)

The default English of-course-I'm-not-a-racist term is "Paki".

Angels weep territory, this.

Re Tatoos

They are part of Maoritanga - Maori culture - and just recently a woman took
a potential employer (who owned a coffee shop) to the race Concilaitons
tribulnal as she claimed the reason she was refused a job was she had a moko
(facial tatoo mostly ) on her mouth - and that the lady emploer to be had
said it would put customers off  (it may have been racialy caused - but the
owner probably has a right to refuse if someone is wearing strange clothes
or has a tatoo - i would reserve that right as an employer - I would reserve
the right not to employ people for my own private reasons if  I felt I didnt
like  and  (business is business - I am building small business and in
business you have to be fairly tough  - especialy re employment) (but it
shows that more Maori are showing a more open cultural fight back which in
itself is a good thing) on- the early Maori had them (but mostly only chiefs
or those who were higher so to speak)- a number of Maori now have tatoos eg
one very prominent Maori activist - who I have met (( the other day he
blasted  what he thought was a NZ flag with shot gun and charges are
pending!) - the funny side (its amusing even if it was a NZ flag as the flag
is very boring a kind of copy of the Union Jack) of that is that it was an
Aussie flag - it looks almost the same)) - has a full facial tatoo - the
tatoos, like Maori caving, tell stories - in the Maori (early) houses the
ornate carvings tell of the tangata whenua -- (people of the land)'s
istory  - that is it relates the story of the ancestors - the tipuna

I personally dont like tattoos - people have right to wear them - but I dont
like them.

But I suppose that is just me.

"Here comes Third Man, tattooed from head to foot:  he's like a map, a
multi-dimensional coloured moving map, one huge moko. He has returned,
having "done the rounds" in his wheelchair - he goes all night, touring the
hospital, seeing, thinking, talking. He's no fool - he wouldn't waste his
time saying "Ein jeder Engel es schrecklick" over and over to himself. He
passes my bed. "Out like a light eh?"... I mutter "Morpheus", drowsily. He
counters: "Word rapping now eh?"



That is from my poem sequence /journal -poem called "Hospital"  - some more
of it  -



Hospital 1


"Since only children have the power to grip the lightning."

The above sentence read, in Baxter's Collected Poems,

in Middlemore Hospital, Otahuhu, 8.45, the 15th of January 2004.

The air con, the drip machines, the click clacks of comings and goings...

Someone calls.



Here are three men: we share nights.



Third Man (also known as Spider Man) is a Maori who crushed his foot in a
hydraulic lifter  while shifting a house. He tells everyone how he was 17
years in Paremoremo: "Hospital is exactly like prison...you have to adapt,
and fight for yourself: and learn." I call him Third Man as initially there
were three of us in the Ward: Spider Man and me shared with a South African
businessman who accidentally hit his tibia with a gimpy (no break, but bad
enough for the doctors to be concerned). He gets on his cell phone in the
morning telling everyone (at his office, whoever, wherever) it's no big
matter. He speaks in English, then a language I can't make out - Afrikaans,
German, Polish, Russian?



Now Third Man returns on the wheelchair he has rigged for himself. He's been
here since December.





Before I came here I was reading Rilke's "Duino Elegies" (German/English
edition) and the phrase "Ein jeder Engel es schrecklick" ('Every angel is
terrible') keeps running in my mind. I had also been reading a poem a day of
Smithyman's.  Baxter's job is to illuminate Smithyman by providing a
contrast.



Here comes Third Man, tattooed from head to foot: he's like a map, a
multi-dimensional coloured moving map, one huge moko. He has returned,
having "done the rounds" in his wheelchair - he goes all night, touring the
hospital, seeing, thinking, talking. He's no fool - he wouldn't waste his
time saying "Ein jeder Engel es schrecklick" over and over to himself. He
passes my bed. "Out like a light eh?"... I mutter "Morpheus", drowsily. He
counters: "Word rapping now eh?"



It has been established that the electrically controlled bed is mine, as it
is for old women. I am a man, but dignity allows. If I had to I would
survive 30 years in Paremoremo.  Dignity allows, we reach; we are, here,
somewhere. Third Man wheels up to my bed again, tells me "The party's just
begun". I rise, I write: I am not an angel or a super being. Voices: the air
conditioning.



Tomorrow they may cut, cure or kill. Mein Tochter has not (yet) come.
Tomorrow perhaps. We live, we live in, hope. Words.



Later I rouse  - I took some Tramadol and something else - and talk on and
on -  about God, fear, love, and nations, and rugby: and nations. The drugs
make me talk. I decide to avoid painkillers as much as possible. My foot and
ankle area of the lower leg, where the bones snapped at the Panmure Basin (I
dropped, ridiculously from some monkey bars), swells and swells. An
operation is impossible.



When Gerhardt was here he was interested in how Zulu is spread... talk of
languages and cultures. I think (now, here, typing, this up) of how I was
bashed in the face in the 1981 protests against the Springbok tour. The cops
were trying to smash my teeth in.



Sebastian (about 7 months) listens a little:  cannot understand he might be
reason, light to me. Victor grips my shoulder. In 1990 the cops knocked his
eye out with a baton.



Later the nurse helps get me out, we change the bed, I piss in a bottle,
wash with a basin and flannel, the bed is made, I get back in, leg up: I am
re-established. Morning will bring.



Hospital  2



Waiting to be happened to can be terrible:

but, it happens: you imagine that they will

cut - one seems sacrifice - but Third Man

has had many ops, knows the land, the lie,

the lies: is about at night, being.

Paracetemol only - this morning. The air conditioner sings.



Today, the sun: the master machine. Third Man reports
of a man who has lost a leg, who "has the right attitude".

True. I read a book, forgetting what might or might not be true, is.



Everywhere they are moving, waking, dying, arising, and
Here, and there:  recording, relaying, collating; notes are made, records.

(One is perhaps information, hopefully registering, remembered.)



The sun winks - it knows - Te Ra knows - somehow things work.

Systems. There is always doubt, error, annoyance..

Remember falling and then the click, the snap: definite, clear.



16/1/04



         Hospital 3



I am now demoted! A man of eighty or so is in the bed opposite.

My operation is over if not out. One accustoms. Each minute is
to be resurrected into a bank of jewels, or violets, the music stealing

(as is the usual case with these things).



Know that layers on layers hereby lie: note this: note that as I am now
writing this after the time it took place, or as I recall it took place (I
think I had come out of an operation, and my recollections are still
uncertain as to time and exact place) reality is impossible, though a bus is
undoubtedly still a bus.



Stealth - how time throats us. An old man with my name, Richard, is here
now. It is very hot, as they don't open the side windows: I am sweating and
swelling: I turn the fan on...



                              how to say things? I evaded



             the claw of the Wahi Ngaro



I watch the boxing, a little ill from some tramadol I think I took and one
(the only one) inject of morphine from the machine. Mundine defeats a Jap
boxer - with courage the Japanese man comforts his daughter. Mundine  was
fast.  But the Japanese man - the man, the father, he falls but falls with
courage.



                        Suddenly I fear death.



The old man has come from another hospital, is very old, perhaps his is some
terrible struggle. I hope he recovers. I too have reason to live. To
struggle. Third Man calls people whanau - wants to know about everyone's
whanau.  He has "F U C K Y O U" tattooed on his forehead.



                       Are we are all whanau?



 the pen, the tongue, the idea, aroha, being here...

"I was 17 years in Paremoremo - I did all sorts of things, hospital is just
like jail, you have to learn the system to survive: I did all sorts of
things, I raped a woman, but all women get raped." I've worked with men like
him.his angle is to belittle me - the Pakeha: somehow I want to like the
guy, but am preoccupied with surviving. In some things he's right, or is he?
Fuck the black hori, fuck whatever women he might or might not have raped: I
only want to not feel  sick.



 Hospital 4



Third Man teaches me the word wharepaki which at first I mistake for
parepake.  That's what I'm worrying about - how can I have a shower and
later a shit with dignity? Eventually I get to the toilet and it is easier
than I feared.



But wharepaki is better than toilet or shithouse or "how do I go about
getting to the toilet for a shit with a cast on my leg on a wheel chair?"
Bog is ok. Bog rather than dunny...



How did we get here? By what windings, derivations, tricks, trials,
travails, accidents, slips, deaths, births, misdirections? The ships set
forth - in my parents' case, for New Zealand, Aotearoa. My father and his
brother, from London, to work on farms - to maybe keep a farm. The
depression met them. My father soon gave up his hobby of painting. My uncle
arrived owing $20 pounds for a tooth op, but later became an agricultural
scientist and the head of a chemical company. He died of bone cancer aged
about 85. My mother came from England to Melbourne then New Zealand in 1939.
"It looked like a village."





        Hospital 5



Waiting for the operation. I feel calm - whether because of the valium, or
because I am getting used - used to this place..



People. People in the corridors. Third Man is out again. There is a Samoan
girl with a broken leg in the next bed - she is to go to the women's ward
when beds are free. One hears of shortages, crises, invasions, the
destruction of social services, doctors worked near to death - terrible
terrible terrible - how true? One cannot know. The three terribles were
ironic but I meant it (insofar as one can mean)...do you see what I mean? I
spy with my little eye.



The complex, the nexus of things like a body: head and brain, the thousands
of nerves, neurons, blood, fibres, blood pulsing, heart pumping, electrons,
sugar, mitochondria and ribosomes, transmitters, synapses: all of it like
Sebastian's Busytown. A neuronic New York, a Megalopolis. A megalomaniacal
metropolis...



One is private partly. Shut up mind, stop thinking. Pissing in a bottle is
absurd. Why do I seem to float? Their job is their job. The cat was fed -
house shut up.  I chucked my spare set of keys to some fulla from the
ambulance: please drive my car home, lock it, throw the keys inside and lock
the door - I have spare set.



I read - intermittently - Baxter's Jerusalem sonnets. I am surprised; they
are better than I remember. Everything is surprise.





                             Hospital   6



                          Wahi Ngaro



                the rocks emerging into men -

                the process is terrible, tyrannical

hassen,
i agree 100% with you on The Pillow Book.
it's my favorite Greenaway film, making beautiful the human
body and the written word in one brush stroke.

poetry never seemed so HOT, frankly!

when i was a kid i used to have intense nose bleeds, which
eventually resulted in electrical cauterization.  but at one
point in those years of bleeding, i would let the blood
flow into my hands, then cover my naked body with the blood.
when it dried (which a coating of blood doesn't take too long,
maybe a couple of minutes), i'd wet my fingers with water (or
spit if i wasn't in the bathroom) and draw symbols on my body.

when i was down at the Edgar Cayce Institute i met a psychic
woman there, a lovely old grandma type, and she told me that
i used to do this!  i was already getting used to psychic people
at this time, so i wasn't too shocked, but there is always a bit
of shock when you encounter a psychic, maybe because you
feel slightly violated.  but anyway, she told me that those  symbols
i was drawing on my bloodied body were from another alphabet
from another lifetime.

my interest in studying the runes today has much to do with
this, i'm sure.  especially studying Freya Asswyn  _http://www.aswynn.co.uk/_
(http://www.aswynn.co.uk/)

but also, when i was a young teen, and had my first boyfriend,
he and i used to go to a creek, deep in the woods where i lived.
one day i started painting mud symbols on his naked body, and
this became a ritual for us both, something we looked forward to,
something very strange, something secret since it was too awkward
to tell any of our friends.  it doesn't seem even remotely weird to  me
now to do something like this, but at thirteen it sure did.

I will be guest editing an issue of the electronic poetry journal MiPOesias.

I'm looking for epistolary poetry, textual improprieties, list poems,
abecedariums, poems that question, poems that sing, poems that exude pheromones.

Go to this site for submission guidelines:
http://www.mipoesias.com/volume19Issue2/guidelines.html

Kind of like Lydia?



My life was wrapped around the circus.
Her name was Lydia.
I met her at the world's fair in 1900,
marked down from 1940.

Ah, Lydia.
She was the most glorious creature
Under the su-un.
Guiess. DuBarry. Garbo.
Rolled into one.

Oooooooh
Lydia oh Lydia, say have you met Lydia,
Lydia, the Tatooed Lady.
She has eyes that folks adore so,
And a torso even more so.

Lydia oh lydia, that encyclopidia,
Oh Lydia the Queen of Tatoo.
On her back is the Battle of Waterloo.
Beside it the wreck of the Hesperus, too.
And proudly above waves the Red, White, and Blue,
You can learn a lot from Lydia.

La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la

When her robe is unfurled, she will show you the world,
If you step up and tell her where.
For a dime you can see Kankakee or Paris,
Or Washington crossing the Delaware.

La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la

Oh Lydia oh lydia, say have you met Lydia,
Oh Lydia the Tatooed Lady
When her muscles start relaxin',
Up the hill comes Andrew Jackson

Lydia oh Lydia, that encyclopidia,
oh Lydia the queen of them all!
For two bits she will do a mazurka in jazz,
With a view of Niagara that nobody has.
And on a clear day you can see Alcatraz.
You can learn a lot from Lydia.

La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la

Come along and see Buff'lo Bill with his lasso.
Just a little classic by Mendel Picasso.
Here is Captain Spaulding exploring the Amazon.
Here's Godiva but with her pajamas on.

La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la

Here is Grover Whalen unveilin' the Trilon.
Over on the West Coast we have Treaure Island.
Here's Najinsky a-doin' the rhumba.
Here's her social security numba.

{whistles}La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la

Oh Lydia, oh Lydia that encyclopidia,
Oh Lydia the champ of them all.
She once swept an Admiral clear off his feet.
The ships on her hips made his heart skip a beat.
And now the old boy's in command of the fleet,
For he went and married Lydia.

I said Lydia
{He said Lydia}
They said said Lydia
{We said Lydia}
La La!

From "At the Circus" - Marx Bros.

Hi all,

I would also like to advertise my blwough:

there are pics of this nice art gallery MeranoArte, I always love to
go and visit (click and they open up);

some notes on the latest movies I watched:

The Draughtsman Contract by Peter Greenaway
Solaris by Andrei Tarkovsky
Edward II by Derek Jarman
A woman under the influence - and The Killing of a Chinese Bookie by
John Cassavetes
by Derek Jarman again: Super8 Programme (he is English) vol. 1 & 2;

I advertise Big Bridge the great poetry site of Michael Rothenberg and
there is one of my pOms among the elegies;

I translated a couple of pOms by Michael Rothenberg and one by Rebecca Seiferle;

I send you to read a good pOm by Chris Murray on her Texfiles;

and I add my _flashing scarlet fishing nets_;

I also thank James Finnegan for the list of audios he sent to New Poetry,
and talk of the birth day of New Poetry with Carl Sandburg's God's
Children sent by James.

and much and more...
thanks for the visit, if you wish you can leave a couple of pennies to
the guardian gods at the entrance :-)
appreciated,

The m[emes ]or(e, love is always more, that
ex[oskeletal]tra line Kierkegaard writes, mor)phine
see (video game controllers forgotten on the floor,
closed roo)ms to have kick( this alchemy of soiled off
the b)ed Mary's ass.

You know, the epics start like this:

She's light and dark. I like being held in place and
squeezed until I'm blinded looking home. Jeran sle(eek
elevation, vacant and disruptive st)eps in angles
completely still. Caleb wanders into the second living
room, bo[nes ordered by function, some ]red
momentarily by planning blow-ups on a ruffled screen.
I'll plant kisses along Mary's( a frozen rose with
petals too frail to ) throat from time to time.
Drive's full. Adult-swim could be on. Her
fearlessness, war[ against derisive laughter; lean
back against and fuse with the fish, become ]mer than
anything else. Bad circulation gets around; my hands
and feet are cold.

Mary is a taoist Mary is a dadaist I live with a cut
of birds' wings bloody for a mouth and I'm living in
moody villages after midnight crossing a bridge lit
over a frozen lake

Yurr... People you never suspected of being racist talk of going to the Paki
shop. I think that is somwhere between Jap and nigger in the offensiveness
stakes: the former seems to me more disrespectful than abusive, but often
just because people are too lazy to say the whole word, like Scot and
Scottish, and BLT & any number of acronyms. I'd restrict Scotch to blended
whisky myself...

The Japanese can take care of themselves, but I question how well you
could if you said that word to the wrong people.  Even your wife sitting
next to you would have to caution you about that.  S or Z?  Actually,
I've seen it spelled in Romaji both ways.  It depends on how much buzz
in the teeth we Gai koku jin can muster when we think it, write it, or
say it.

Having said all that--are you still in Japan?  If so, it'd be great to
connect.  I'm near Tokyo, but Nagasaki and surrounds is my favorite
place to be and I have a research project that will take me there next
academic year.  Has your wife heard of Chijiwa in Nagasaki Prefecture?
That's my home away from home.  It's on the far side of Mount Unzen
(also spelled sometimes with an s) and close to Shimabara.

No, actually both of the students were somewhat older than the rest, and
I definitely got the sense that the lady with the dragon had a stormy
past.  Jesse

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Alexander, I'm on digest here, and it appears that someone came up with
one reason that Jap could be offensive to Japanese people, but I believe
that it has to do with the usage of the word during the great influx of
Chinese and Japanese into the U.S. in the latter half of the 19th c.  I
don't have a dictionary of slang here, but I imagine there's one
online someplace and it would probably indicate an origin of around 1890
or so.  There was a great backlash against the "Yellow Hoards" that
resulted in Congress passing a law (when was it? 1923?) that prohibited
all Asians from settling in America.  Then of course the word really
came into play during WWII and in the years immediately after.  All of
that real hate and decades of discrimination are associated with that
word, and that's the inheritance most of us on this list have been
given via the reality of WWII and its reflection on the U.S. side of the
river in propaganda.

Of course the Japanese have their own offensive word for foreign
people--and Steve and his wife from Nagasaki no doubt know this one:
Gaijin, which is short for Gaikokujin, or person from an outside or
foreign country.  Funny, but I've heard mainly white men and women in
Tokyo (who usually don't know the language) laughingly refer to
themselves in the presence of Japanese folks in this manner, but it
really is a slam, with all the negative resonance of the n word, but
while Jap is almost universally responded to, Gaijin is not widely
known.  If you're in the countryside and it's just you among the
Japanese and you've lost that certainty that you're connected to the
COUNTRY WITH THE MOSTEST in the WORLD, and you hear someone refer to you
as Gaijin, after trying your best to do your best, it really hurts.

The Chinese also have their word for foreign people and that's
Hongbizhi--red nose.  Lucas, if you're reading--you're welcome to
correct my spelling here!

I think the best people to ask, though, are the Japanese and
Japanese-American members of this list.  Sawako Nakayasu could probably
articulate just what it is that makes the word Jap offensive to the
Japanese much better than I.  She occasionally reads postings on this
list so perhaps she could step in and enlighten us all.

Jesse

Johnny 'Dark O' Negroponte Named 'Supreme Intelligence Overlord':
Cannistraro Voted "Go To Liar Of the Century" By National Press Corps
BY KNUKIE RUZE


They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

I lost an 'e'! Please help me find it! No, it isn't that 'e' and it isn't
that one (now quite a few words after the other and before this) either. I
don't know where it went! It wasn't alone, at least I don't think it was
alone. It was in the middle of a word! At the beginning! The ending! The
feminine ending (for perhaps it wasn't english at all - the word or the
piece it was in - if it was in a piece - I should say 'were' in a piece -
there's two more 'e's but it's not them, I'm sure of it)! Or some such -
how can one be sure of anything nowadays? In any case, I'm sure you'd
recognize it; you could tell perhaps by its indolent expression, suave
self-assuredness. Perhaps it's disguised, however, perhaps run away! It's
a sign of the times - you can't count on letters any more, at least not
belles lettres filled with 'e's - there's a kind of immigration here -
where did they come from? For that matter, where are they going? They know
something, they're not telling - that's about as far as I can take it!
It's definitely well-hidden (not there, with its two 'e's, nor hidden in
hidden, although something is?)! Be careful! Please help! Thank you!

Little 'e', come home to roam!
Little 'e', come home to Rome!

Steve, I have one Japanese sister in law and have another brother who has
been in Japan for 12 years who could very easily marry a Japanese woman.

As most of us can suspect, Bush is using Camus (!) for even more Stranger
forms of cover in Brussells. Scott Ritter just spoke in Washington State to
reveal the news that Bush has recently signed off on US plans to attack Ira=
n
in June. Who knows, yet, if Syria is included? The new Haliburton map of th=
e
Mid-East is clearly designed to include the full Oil swath from Afghanistan
across Iraq, Iran, Syria, etc. It is also the Neocon forecast, apparently,
that the peoples in each country will instantly rejoice in liberation and
instantly start building self-determining democratic governments. Thomas
Friedman is already (again) beginning to write about the revolutionary
democratic force of the "Arab Street." Etc.

As my 93 year old petroleum engineer Dad - who worked for Chevron for 40
years - shakes his head at the prospect and and says, "It's amazing what
they will do for a gas station."

One can only imagine what car etc. hungry Russia and China are also shaking
their heads - or strategizing - around these prospects as well.

And isn't nice that Gonzales and Negroponte - the so-called Torture Twins -
are now conveniently in charge of domestic surveillance (in case you were
thinking of organizing and participating in the next anti-war protests,
etc.) !!

Welcome to the Millennium. I say it's getting quite dark down here. Anybody
got a light??!!

Kevin,
I don't agree that I had answered my own question.  Nor do I view this =
as a matter of my growing up.  It's more a matter of gaping wounds =
having healed from the passage of time.  =20

Usage of words during the war differs greatly from usage of =
today..."Jap" as used during the war and in the years immediately =
following always came with a precede:  "dirty jap" "lying japs" "lousy =
japs" etc. etc. (and let's not forget the equally derogatory term =
"nips."   And if you remember any of the action comic books of the days =
during the war, you might also remember that the soldiers of the emperor =
were depicted as ogres with canine fangs and showing heavy dog-like =
slobber hanging from their maws.  I know I needn't explain the whys of =
that practice in the propaganda mechanism to you.  And, indeed, =
propaganda it was.    =20

That description of the enemy of the time lasted a decade beyond the war =
at least.  However during the Douglas MacArthur years of redevelopment =
of the nation, hatred and animosity between the two nations diminished =
somewhat. MacArthur not only respected his enemy militarily, he admired =
the people and their traditions. (I also suspect he enjoyed playing at =
being emperor MacArthur of the South Pacific and Japan, but that's an =
entirely different subject.)

By the time MacArthur died (mid 60's if memory serves), most of the =
mutual hatred between the two nations had disappeared.  Japan not only =
had been rebuilt it had developed into a major economic force in =
electronics and automobile manufacturing.  And that success, combined =
with the shifting of huge capital investments from American, Canadian & =
British corporations into the nation, helped obliterate war memories and =
assuage some of the hatred felt by both sides. =20

I have (ooops had, he died a month ago now) a friend, Jim =
Lynch...wounded at 19 serving in the South Pacific on a US battleship in =
1944.  He lost the top half of his right lung, and had a hug (fist =
sized) hole in his rib cage just below the right shoulder joint.  Jim =
returned home; became a lawyer, and years later was elected Mayor of =
Wenatchee, WA. =20

Wenatchee has a sister city in Japan.  As part of his mayoral duties, =
Jim and wife flew to Japan with the sister city delegates.  They had a =
grand time, but in one of the official activities, Jim was to be =
introduced to one of the city officials...a man of about Jim's age, who =
had been in battles in the South Pacific and had been captured by =
American and Australian forces.  =20

Bottom line of the tale: neither the two former adversaries wanted to =
shake hands, and this was some 30 years after the days of combat and =
injury(both had been severely wounded).  They finally did agree to a =
meeting after a translator convinced the Japanese gentleman that the =
American was willing.  They met, chatted, and began a friendship that =
lasted nearly 20 years before the elderly Japanese died. =20

What was interesting to me about the tale is learning that the animosity =
was two-sided; I've no idea what propaganda the Japanese used during the =
war but I'm certain of one thing, they too had their "dirty yanks" or =
what ever they referred to Americans as. =20

Those days are long over for both sides.  And our two nations have grown =
fond of each other, both politically as well as culturally.  And I think =
it safe to say most of the anti-Japanese hatred is gone from =
America...that is not to say there aren't still some old soldiers =
hanging around who harbor hatred.  Nor is that to suggest that America =
too has its share of ignorant and prejudiced morons within its =
boundaries...again, different subject.=20

So, do Americans, born say after 1970, use the word "Jap" in the way it =
was used in say 1941-1951?  I don't think so.  I see no evidence of the =
lingering propaganda materials.  Further, given what we know of the =
penchant of English speaking peoples to seek shortening in words, I =
reason, saying Jap, as a shortening of Japanese, is an acceptable =
alternative identifier. =20

I don't view the word in the same context as I do, kyke or nigger, mick, =
spick, or wop.  These ultra-nasty derogatory expressions are not =
shortened forms of a root word. They are themselves words lacking any =
positive attributes in either denotative nor connotative context.  That =
is not true of the word, Jap.  This is a logical construct that =
facilitates communication...it's just easier to say or write Jap, than =
it is to say or write Japanese.

By the way, a good many Canadians and British citizens as well use the =
term Yank as their chosen shortening of American...and the term is =
sometimes used in a positive manner, and sometimes used in a very =
derogatory manner.  The difference of course is both context and tone =
(if spoken).  And I have been in bars in both London, Ontario and in =
London, England where I experienced both a negative and a positive =
intention of the speakers.=20

Is it not possible that the word Jap can have both a negative and a =
positive meaning determined by the style and tone of the deliverer?  And =
if not, why not?  Or, is it that the word Jap will forever be labeled by =
the Japanese as derogatory because of some kind of memetric dynamics? =20

Alex
P.S. if you look up the word Jap on "WordWeb"  you get the following =
definition:"Noun: 1. a person of Japanese descent." And the synonym =
given is "Nip."  There is no suggestion in that definition to any =
derogatory or racist-slur connotations.  Of course creators of WordWeb =
were probably born after 1980 and have no preconceived War propaganda =
hang-ups of any kind.=20

the three missing chapters from "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" that he

------------------------------------------------------------------------
40 years ago today on February 21, 1965 Malcolm X was shot dead as he
spoke at the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem. He had just taken the stage
when shots rang out riddling his body with bullets. Malcolm X was 39
years old.

At his funeral, the actor and civil rights activist Ossie Davis hailed
Malcolm as "our Black shining prince."

Today commemorations are scheduled across the country.

In New York, the Center for Contemporary Black History and the Institute
for Research in African-American Studies at Columbia University are
sponsoring "Malcolm X: Life After Death -- the Legacy Endures" an
educational forum and radio broadcast. The program will be chaired by
historian Manning Marable, founding director of the Institute for
Research in African-American Studies.

The historic Abyssinian Baptist Church is also hosting a national
commemoration of Malcolm X with Percy Sutton, Sonia Sanchez, Haki
Madhubuti, Dr. James Turner, Gil Noble, Rev. Herbert Daughtry and M-1 of
Dead Prez.

Later this year, the Audubon Ballroom is scheduled to reopen as the
Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Education Center on May 19
on what would have been Malcolm's 80th birthday.

Meanwhile Columbia University professor Manning Marable is working on a
major new biography on Malcolm X. Marable has already spent 10 years
researching the book which is tentatively titled "Malcolm X: A Life of
Reinvention."

Today Professor Marable joins us in our Firehouse Studios to discuss the
legacy of Malcolm X as well as some of his new findings.

Marable has said "Malcolm X was potentially a new type of world leader,
personally drawn up from the 'wretched of the earth into a political
stratosphere of international power. And telling that remarkable, true
story is the purpose of my biography."

Marable's research has raised new questions about The Autobiography of
Malcolm X which was written with Alex Haley. Marable has also examined
un-redacted FBI files which provides new insight into the role of FBI
and the New York Police Department in the assassination of Malcolm X

We will be joined by Professor Marable in a moment, but first we begin
with the words of Malcolm X recorded a month before he was killed. In
January 1965 he gave a speech entitled "Prospects for Freedom."

Malcolm X for more then ten years. It will be published by Viking in 2008.

AMY GOODMAN: We will be joined by Professor Marable in just a moment,
but first we begin with Malcolm X himself in words recorded just a
months before he was assassinated. It was January 1965, he gave this
speech entitled "Prospects for Freedom."


MALCOLM X: When this country here was first being founded, there were 13
colonies. The whites were colonized. They were fed up with this taxation
without representation. So some of them stood up and said, liberty or
death. I went to a white school over here in Mason, Michigan. The white
man made the mistake of letting me read his history books. He made the
mistake of teaching me that Patrick Henry was a patriot and George
Washington – wasn’t nothing non-violent about old Pat or George
Washington. Liberty or death was what brought about the freedom of
whites in this country from the English. They didn't care about the
odds. Why, they faced the wrath of the entire British Empire. And in
those days, they used to say that the British Empire was so vast and so
powerful, the sun would never set on it. This is how big it was, yet
these 13 little scrawny states, tired of taxation without
representation, tired of being exploited and oppressed and degraded,
told that big British Empire, liberty or death. And here you have 22
million Afro-Americans, black people today, catching more hell than
Patrick Henry ever saw. And I'm here to tell you, in case you don't know
it, that you got a new - you got a new generation of black people in
this country, who don't care anything whatsoever about odds. They don't
want to hear you old Uncle Tom handkerchief heads talking about the
odds. No. This is a new generation. If they're going to draft these
young black men and send them over to Korea or South Vietnam, to face
800 million Chinese. If you are not afraid of those odds, you shouldn't
be afraid of these odds.

AMY GOODMAN: Malcolm X, a month before he was assassinated. It was
January 1965 at a speech he gave in New York, sponsored by the Militant
Labor Forum. This is Democracy Now! We're joined by Professor Manning
Marable, one of America's most influential and widely read scholars,
professor of history and African American Studies at Columbia
University, founding director of the Institute for Research in African
American studies, again working on a new biography of Malcolm X. Welcome
to Democracy Now!

MANNING MARABLE: Thank you. It's always great to be here.

AMY GOODMAN: It is great to be with you. Why don't you summarize for us
– I mean, you have been studying Malcolm X for more than a decade now -
what you think are the most explosive findings and then throughout the
hour, we will tease them out and talk about them.

MANNING MARABLE: I think that Malcolm X was the most remarkable
historical figure produced by Black America in the 20th century. That's
a heavy statement, but I think that in his 39 short years of life,
Malcolm came to symbolize Black urban America, its culture, its
politics, its militancy, its outrage against structural racism and at
the end of his life, a broad internationalist vision of emancipatory
power far better than any other single individual that he shared with
DuBois and Paul Robeson, a pan-Africanist internationalist perspective.
He shared with Marcus Garvey a commitment to building strong black
institutions. He shared with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a commitment
to peace and the freedom of racialized minorities. He was the first
prominent American to attack and to criticize the U.S. role in Southeast
Asia, and he came out four-square against the Vietnam War in 1964, long
before the vast majority of Americans did. So that Malcolm X represents
the cutting edge of a kind of critique of globalization in the 21st
century. In fact, Malcolm, if anything, was far ahead of the curve in so
many ways.

AMY GOODMAN: We're going to break and then when we come back, we are a
going to talk about The Autobiography of Malcolm X, the missing
chapters, and where they are, which you have got a chance to see
excerpts of.

MANNING MARABLE: That's right.

AMY GOODMAN: We're going to talk about how the autobiography was
written, and the F.B.I., their relationship with Alex Haley. We will
talk about these things and more in just a minute.

>>So, do Americans, born say after 1970, use the word "Jap" in the way it
was used in say 1941-1951?  I don't think so.  I see no evidence of the
lingering propaganda materials.<<

And yet I remember when the Japanese bought Rockefeller Center in NYC--not a
few people, some of them in print and on TV, revived in updated terms the
old yellow hoard stereotypes, except that instead of overrunning us
physically, they were simply going to buy our land out from under us, or at
least our most important pieces of real estate, and, so to speak, charge us
rent to live in our own homes. I don't remember that Jap as an epithet was
resurrected at that time, though it wouldn't surprise me if papers like the
Daily News or New York Post used it. You may be right, Alexander, that the
feelings of mutual hatred between the US and Japan no longer run as high as
they did during the war, but the racial stereotypes and fears that
underwrote that hatred--on both sides--are still very much a part of both
cultures, just waiting to be tapped into.

>>Further, given what we know of the penchant of English speaking peoples to
seek shortening in words, I reason, saying Jap, as a shortening of Japanese,
is an acceptable alternative identifier.... I don't view the word in the
same context as I do, kyke or nigger, mick, spick, or wop.<<

Which raises the question of whether you can ever cleanse a word, even
partially, of its history. Actually, cleanse is the wrong word. I suppose
what I mean is, Can you ever really divorce a word from its history? Look at
the radical feminist attempt to reclaim the word cunt, or the way some
African-Americans refer to each other as nigger. Each grows out of a
subversive politics. The difference here, of course, Alexander is that you
are not Japanese, and you are not, as I read you, trying to be subversive.
Rather, you seem to me to be trying to depoliticize a word, or at least to
suggest it has developed to the point where it can be used apolitically, and
I just wonder, given the word you are talking about and its history, if
that's really possible.

It seems to me that the ultimate test is what Japanese people feel about the
word--as in the case of cunt and nigger, the subversive use of each grows
out of how women and African-American feel about the word--which is not to
say that only Japanese can have opinions about the use(s) of the word, but
that the question of whether it is racist and offensive all of the time/some
of the time/never should rest finally with Japanese people, the people to
whom the word refers.

And I would also add that I think the example of Steve and his wife, or of
any two intimates of whatever gender and relationship, is ultimately not a
proving ground for any theory or politics about a word like Jap. People who
are intimate like that cross all kinds of boundaries with each other that
they would not let others cross, linguistically and otherwise. Those
relationships, precisely because they are intimate and boundary-crossing,
are not representative of--though they may still be colored by--the
cultural, gendered, racial, national, religious etc. relationships that give
rise to words like cunt and Jap and nigger.

I havent been following your poems -each one I mean - but this on for
example is fascinating - great use of words etc. Can you comment on its
"meaning" or where/or how or whether - it fits into a larger project -

if not - disregard it is quite haunting regardless..

Dear friends, family, and inhabitants of my address book,

I have changed email addresses. Please update your address books
accordingly. My old address (cartograffiti@mindspring.com) will
continue to work for a month, but this one
(cartograffiti@sbcglobal.net) is the new permanent address. Sorry to do
this in such an impersonal way: if you're someone I should have been in
touch with and this is the first you've heard from me in a while, I'm
sorry and I miss you. If you're someone who is mystified at your
inclusion in my address book, I apologize for the intrusion.

Finally, if you didn't receive an earlier email from me noting my
change of address and phone number, write back and I'll get that to
you. I'd rather not append it to a widely-distributed message like
this.

Best regards,
Taylor Brady

I don't think China is that car hungry - you Americans assume everyone wants
cars etc etc - they (China) are well aware of the stupidity of clogged roads
pollution etc - the Chinese are a great nation and a very
democratic -perhaps the most in the world despite anti-communist
propaganda - the\\china was attacked by the Japs in WW2 and understandably
they hate and are wary of the Japanese ( eth US will probably be secretly
arming  the Japs right now against China) - they're also well armed with
IBM'S and will be backing North Korea -don't believe to the contrary - and I
support Korea having nukes - see what happens if you don't have them - the
US bomb you...and Korea was invaded by the US and the so - called United
Nations  (who collaborated killing millions of civilians in Korea -where
hospitals etc were bombed daily) in an attempt to punch through to China -
the prize the US has always coveted...  before that the US let Japan take
China, and only when the US came under threat (by a rival Imperialist
Power - Japan) did   it retaliate also when they realised that  the Soviet
Union was coming down from the North also advancing across Europe - other
otherwise the US didn't want to help Britain until that nation was weak -
broken - a deliberate and cynical policy  - nor did they help the Jews -
they used the Jews after the war and now back Israel -  another cynical set
up -then they entered Europe to head of the Soviet Imperialists (and there
is evidence they were very supportive (secretly) of many  nazis who found
their way to the US) - but China has its own oil resources and will be a big
trader in the future especially of countries who will drop the US when it
collapses - never has China invaded another country (Tibet's always a part
of China) - never rained down massive tonnages of bombs, napalm, nerve
installed dictators only to have then overthrown as an excuse for an
invasion etc or for purposes of destabilization - on the contrary  - China
has helped many countries economically - no way will China let itself be
attacked  by madmen such as Bush and women such as Rice - a token black and
a token woman  - as Kofee Anan is a token black - he grovels to the US ( if
not they would probably assassinate him - but he's gutless ) - etc - they
are waiting while the US does its usual stupid bombing and invading and
making itself unpopular. If S/11 wasn't organized by the US itself then it
may as well have been - it was waiting to happen and it was payback for
Vietnam, Cambodia (10 to 20 millions killed in that area?), and Chile and
Cuba (Che Guevara), Indonesia, Korea, Panama, Nigeria, Malawi, Yugoslavia,
the backing of Israel's mad adventures and wars, interference in Australia's
politics, New Zealand's, Europe's, the deliberate disintegration of the
USSR, the Marshall Islands, the Bikini Atoll, Diego Garcia, San Salvador,
vast loan debts onto Mexico, usage of immigrant labour from South America
and other poor nations (that debt loading has impoverished - the US$ has
killed as many people throughout the world as US bombs), bombs and more
bombs, invasions and more invasions -  etc etc etc etc etc etc

The Chinese are no fools they are simply waiting for the US to
self-destruct.
if the US ocntinues on its terrorist path people will lose patience they
will welcome the destruction of the US   and its allies by whatever means -
and if NZ is one - then also the destruction of NZ

- but I would urge NZ to distance itself from the US - we can trade
elsewhere -we don't need the US

Richard Taylor

One can only imagine what car etc. hungry Russia and China are also shaking
their heads - or strategizing - around these prospects as well.

And isn't nice that Gonzales and Negroponte - the so-called Torture Twins -
are now conveniently in charge of domestic surveillance (in case you were
thinking of organizing and participating in the next anti-war protests,
etc.) !!

Welcome to the Millennium. I say it's getting quite dark down here. Anybody
got a light??!!

Since neither of my races are important enough to have holidays devoted
to them, and today is the last major holiday preceding it, I am
wondering all kinds of St. Patties Day questions. Since the celebration
of the day started in the United States is there a reciprocation? When
it comes to a seamróg, if you accidentally pick one up that was five
sided but only four were left remaining and you could not tell, would it
still be effective?

Most importantly how early would an average American Irish person make
plans for St. Patrick's Day? I mean native dances are planned out
usually a year or centuries in advance depending on if done
astrologically. Except for one year when I was with the Replacements for
a week and planned to touch down for a show in my home city on St.
Patrick's Day, I have never had a plan, and that year the plan was
useless, none of us had enough gut left to drink. I am well aware of the
US customs, wearing green, breaking beer bottles instead of cameras,
dying your hair red, wearing kiss me I'm Irish buttons, drinking green
beer, drinking Bailey's Irish cream, cream de menthe, drinking Jameson,
Bushmills, other Irish whiskey, drinking Rye and then the morning
leprechauns. I think I've done it all but I might be missing something
by not planning these elements appropriately like we do using the stars.

Considering my type of luck on this holiday I also have no idea why the
Ides of March precedes it. Does this phenomenon happen because I'm not
Irish?

Dear friends, family, and inhabitants of my address book,

I have changed email addresses. Please update your address books
accordingly. My old address (cartograffiti@mindspring.com) will
continue to work for a month, but this one
(cartograffiti@sbcglobal.net) is the new permanent address. Sorry to do
this in such an impersonal way: if you're someone I should have been in
touch with and this is the first you've heard from me in a while, I'm
sorry and I miss you. If you're someone who is mystified at your
inclusion in my address book, I apologize for the intrusion.

Finally, if you didn't receive an earlier email from me noting my
change of address and phone number, write back and I'll get that to
you. I'd rather not append it to a widely-distributed message like
this.

Best regards,
Taylor Brady

Yes Daithi if you pick up a 5-leaved shamrock with only 4 leaves remaining =
you would know by the "wasp" that the fifth leaf had been there but was =
now gone.  The "wasp" is the outline of the leaf, a sort of very thin =
silver edge just barely visible if you hold the shamrock by the stem up =
against a dark background like a trouser leg.  It would be very effective, =
as the 5-leafed shamrock is very rare; I have only seen a few myself, all =
of them 'wasps.'  Still very potent however (you could get a bad cut from =
one).

Sadly I am not an expert on St. Patrick's Day and have mixed, not to say =
negative, feelings about it.  It always rained on St. Patrick's Day when I =
was a child.  Then, when I grew up a bit, I developed a distaste for =
nationalism.  I now subscribe to the belief that anyone can be godddamn =
Irish if they goddamn want (though why would they indeed). =20

You know David I think I saw you that week you were with The Replacements. =
 That was stunning.  Have you ever written about that?  All those guys =
with their shadowy ghost limbs.  Just like the 5th leaf 'wasps' in fact.  =
Waving like seaweed fronds in the incoming rushing surf.  It was very =
moving.

You ask many hard questions, my dear David.  Profound and deep questions  =
I
feel I may not be the best person to take in hand and knead.  I'm sure =
there is a summer school for such as you where you can wander around like =
a great dandelion clock blowing fluff from your head.  The fares are great =
right now if you book.  You could bring The Replacements.  Maybe we could =
meet up round Roundstone round July.

Richard,

I was in China last December -in Hongkong- and before that about ten years
ago in several cities. One of the most memorable things about the place to me is
the pollution. I remember when I first set foot at Shanghai airport in my
earlier viosit. I thought I was in a chemical factory. Have things changed?

are doors considered furniture?  - for christophe casamassima
(cecil taylor big band @ the iridium  2/20/05)

set1.
it is the story of the one that got away
it is about catching & catching up
how you hear things thhhh r u r ear that
you haven't heard
the one that got away  ( un/herd )
( i liked it - but i liked the one i missed better )
how the one who caught the big one
goes out every day trying to catch another
how the one that got away from the one who
almost caught it must be caught so that the one that didn't
catch it goes out every day trying to catch it or like
you know the story of...... the
it must get caught one way or the other
even
if only in a story
the placement of the chair
the acknowledgement that the chair
exists
outside of you
for reasons other than sitting
it is in the nature of things
is it not?

i cannot relax
i expect to hear what someone else has
told me i missed last night
choices are like
fish in the sea
or
fish in a tank
or
fish on ice
or
fish on the counter
waiting to get their heads
chopped off
waiting to be gutted &
scaled
mountains
weighed

fish in tanks
fish tanks
in restaurants
in homes
domestic fish
or............................
i feel there is a part missing as the action unfolds
is it me     or the action?
if i anticipate some action within the action because i have been told
that the last time this action occurred it contained another action that
tonight might be missing that it contained actions beyond the action
itself components within the fundamental components that are always there
but just may not show themselves tonight which make the action even
greater  more expansive than it usually is- is it my expectation of these
components that keeps me tonight from hearing them my obsession with the
actions that i missed the night before or am i really hearing the action
seeing the action with those components it contained/contains that were
displayed last night when i was not there to hear  or see them exercised
or exorcised, missing tonight?

it is about the one that got away
amassing the point
or am i missing the point?
eye as action
i      as      a(u)ct   ion
the i that is passive action
that is moving beyond myself
its    self
how big was it really?
if more than one person saw/heard
than it must be so
the one that remains
has it really been diminished
because i long to see/hear the one i missed
?
when i was not present?
the one that got away
i diminish my capacity to listen
as my expectations grow
or is there really something missing?
rendered?

render unto that which is rendered unto

i can only conclude that last night i should have been where i wasn't
& that i wasn't where i should have been
but life should be what you make it
& not what others make it for you
.......yet   "i am no longer i,  nor is................"

set 2  (sonnet)
within a tail twice told
a tale alas not pulled

it is the energies of this big sun
inside a brilliant construction

an orbular crescending
omni-versed poe(s)tic

hence you are this always
burning light

this definitely moved
i definitely moved

one last sentence
one more ta(i)le to tell.

WORKSHOPS

THIS WEEK ONLY!

LET'S BE QUICK ABOUT THIS: AN INTRO TO SHORT SHORT FICTION, with Forrest
Roth
Saturday, February 26, 12-4 p.m.
$50, $40 Members

Think of the shortest story you have ever written; then imagine cutting its
length in half. This is what it takes to start creating a streamlined short
story, usually referred to as a "short short." But is a short short simply
determined by the number of words used? Is it an abbreviated character
study? Does it even have plot development to speak of? To answer these
questions, we will look at contemporary American writers excelling in very
short stories, such as Diane Williams and Gary Lutz, as well as Modernists
who experimented with the form. We will also attempt our own short shorts
and brave the intriguing hazzards of paring fiction down to 100 words (or
less!).

Forrest Roth is a graduate of the MFA Creative Writing program at Goddard
College. He currently teaches creative writing at Medaille College and has
stories forthcoming in NOON.

Continuing: You can still sign up for this workshop at a pro-rated cost for
the next 7 weeks!

PLAYWRITING BASICS, with Kurt SchneIderman
8 Tuesdays, February 15- April 5, 7-9 p.m.
$250, $200 for members

Playwright Basics is a weekly workshop open to novice and experienced
playwrights alike. The purpose of the course is to allow participants to
develop playwriting abilities through actual writing and in-class feed back.
Structured as a workshop, the format will allow all participants to produce
and bring in their own work to be read aloud and critiqued by everyone
involved. In addition there will be readinga of various classic theatre
texts and discussion of playwriting structure and theory. Participants can
expect to emerge from this course with some written and workshopped
dialogue, and with an introduction to the overall theoretical framework of
dramatic writing.

Kurt Schneiderman is currently the Dramaturg for the Buffalo Ensemble
Theatre, the Co ordinator of the annual new play competition the Area
Playwrights' Performance Series, and the Director of the monthly new play
forum Play Readings & Stuff. Named one of "Buffalo's emerging young
playwrights" by Gusto Magazine and Buffalo's "next A.R. Gurney" by Artvoice
Magazine, Kurt was the winner of the Helen Mintz Award for Best New Play
(2003) and was nominated for the Artie Award for Outstanding New Play

I'm curious as to what people on this list think of Gary Snyder's new =
book, "Danger on Peaks." Snyder get so little real critique, only mainly =
laudatory commentary. It's as if reviewers, and academics, are afraid of =
him, and this doesn't do anyone any good. Years ago, Snyder had a major =
impact on my work and the direction of my life, so now, a book written =
in his 70s, I'd like to read some thoughtful critique.

Thanks,
Joel

Joel, your critique says it all. I'd like to hear some of your critique - I=
 mean, since it impacted you so much, perhaps your critique is most importa=
nt, to yourself firstly, and secondly to the world in general. As a publish=
er I know I have to make my own rules sometimes. Isn't that the point of be=
ing a human first and a writer second?

Also, who needs a critique when you have readers? The book club may be the =
best design for any critique, because it introduces the action of the book =
i.e. reading. Critics are out to praise writers or discourage readers - the=
re's no sense in holding the critic's hand as you read, but to formulate an=
 effort, a reading, and not an opinion.

Hope this is enlightening for you, because it sure is to me!

Oh Richard, Richard, do for once try thinking before you type.  To wit,

the Chinese are a great nation and a very
> democratic -perhaps the most in the world despite anti-communist

I suppose it's anti-communist propaganda that there was a Tienanmen
Square massacre more than fifteen years ago perpetrated against people
calling for China to be the "democratic" nation you claim it to be.

There are hundreds of rural revolts -- strikes, protests, etc. --
going on right now in China.  I guess the grievances are fed by anti-
communist propaganda rather than poverty and the oppressive policies
of local Communist Party officials, right?

the\\china was attacked by the Japs in WW2

Japs!  Such a lovely little epithet, and one that's been subjected to
some discussion lately on the list.  Did you notice, Richard?

never has China invaded another country (Tibet's
> always a part
> of China)

The Tibetans might have another idea about that, but I suppose they
don't matter much to you.  I'm looking forward to hearing you
write "Chechnya always a part of Russia."  Oh yes, and wasn't there a
war between China and Vietnam about 25-30 years ago, and hasn't
Vietnam always had historical grounds to fear China's hegemonism?

Well, China also supported Jonas Savimbi's brutal war in Angola, sent
arms to crush a (Maoist!) insurrection in Sri Lanka in the early
1970s, supported Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, and stood idly by when
thousands of its partisans were massacred in Indonesia in 1965.  Not
to speak of the millions of dead as a result of demented policies like
the "Great Leap Forward" and palace coups run amok like the "Great
Proletarian Cultural Revolution," which as a few heretics noted at the
time, was neither proletarian, nor cultural, nor a revolution.

If, in the history of every child, language is first of all a mode of eroti=
c expression and then later succumbs to the domination of the reality-princ=
iple, it follows, or perhaps we should say mirrors, the path taken by the h=
uman psyche and must share the ultimate fate of the human psyche, namely ne=
urosis... To regard human speech, the self-evident sign of our superiority =
over animals, as a disease, or at least as essentially diseased, is for com=
mon sense ... a monstrous hypothesis.  Yet psychoanalysis, which insists on=
 the necessary connection between cultural achievement and neurosis and bet=
ween social organization and neurosis, and which therefore defines man as t=
he neurotic animal, can hardly take any other position. ... if psychoanalys=
is is carried to the logical conclusion that  language is neurotic, it can =
join hands with the twentieth century school of  linguistic analysis -- a d=
epth analysis of language -- inspired by that man  with a real genius for t=
he psychopathology of language, Wittgenstein.   He said, "Philosophy is a b=
attle against the bewitchment [Verhexung] of our intelligence by means of l=
anguage."Some of these linguistic analysts have had the project of getting =
rid of the disease in language by reducing language to purely operational t=
erms.  From the psychoanalytic point of view, a purely operational language=
 would be a language without a libidinal (erotic) component; and psychoanal=
ysis would suggest that such a project is impossible because language, like=
 man, has an erotic base, and also useless because man cannot be persuaded =
to operate (work) for operation's sake.  Wittgenstein, if I understand him =
correctly, has a position much closer to that of psychoanalysis; he limits =
the task of philosophy to that of recognizing the inevitable insanity of la=
nguage.  "My aim is," he says, "to teach you to pass from a piece of disgui=
sed nonsense to something that is patent nonsense."  "He who understands me=
 finally recognizes [my propositions] as senseless."  Psychoanalysis begins=
 where Wittgenstein ends.  The problem is not the disease of language, but =
the disease called man.

WRITER GUILLERMO CABRERA INFANTE DIES
WebPosted Tue Feb 22 09:02:17 2005

 LONDON---Cuban-born novelist Guillermo Cabrera Infante, the acclaimed
 Spanish-language writer and critic of the Castro government, has died at
 the age of 75.

Cabrera Infante died in hospital Monday of a blood infection and had
suffered a series of illnesses over the past few years, according to a
spokesperson for his Spanish literary agent, the Balcells agency in
Barcelona.

Celebrated for an experimental use of language in his writing, Cabrera
Infante worked as a literary and film critic, translator, essayist and
novelist. In 1997, he won the Miguel de Cervantes prize for literature,
the Spanish-speaking world's most prestigious literary prize.

His best-known work is the 1967 novel Three Trapped Tigers , the success
of which surprised the author since half of it is written in Cuban slang.
The novel captured the lush, boozy, exciting pre-Revolutionary nightlife
of Havana in the 1950s and has become a classic of Cuban literature.

Other works include the novel Infante's Inferno , the political writing
collection Mea Cuba and A 20th Century Job , a collection of his film
criticism. In addition to novels and essays, Cabrera Infante also wrote
screenplays, including John Huston's film adaptation of Malcolm Lowry's
Under the Volcano .

Born in Gibara, eastern Cuba, in 1929, the writer studied journalism and
became one of Latin America's most acclaimed film critics. He was also a
founding member of Revolucion magazine and an early supporter of Fidel
Castro, serving as a government liaison to Brussels in the early 1960s.
However, by 1965, he became disillusioned with the totalitarian direction
of the government and became a harsh critic of the Castro regime. He
eventually left his home country and in 1966 settled in London, where he

Please come! A bona fide Unpleasant Event Schedule
reading this Saturday!


Saturday, February 26, 2:30pm


An Unpleasant Event Schedule reading.  As part of the
Frequency Reading Series, three UES contributors will
read their work:   Leonard Gontarek (from
Philadelphia), Amy King (from Williamsburg, Brooklyn),
and Tracey Knapp (from Boston).


Location:


Four-Faced Liar
165 West 4th Street
New York, NY
212-366-0608


http://www.shannacompton.com/frequency.html


http://unpleasanteventschedule.com/



AND on Sunday from TYPO Magazine:


Dear friends, readers, writers, and all who yearn for
the burning chair,

We offer the second installment of the Burning Chair
Readings, featuring Sabrina Orah Mark and Marie
Mutsuki Mockett, set for Sunday, February 27th,
sharply at 8PM.  Due to renovations at the Cloister
Café, the gathering will take place two doors down at
**Solas, 232 East 9th Street, between 2nd and 3rd
Avenues.**

Sabrina and Marie write, each in her own way, outside
of the usual literary frameworks.  Each writes
innovatively, accessibly, and beyond prescribed
conventions.  Sabrina’s poems figure their way through
the dark contraptions of the world.  It’s her voice
versus the inventions of the monsters—time, space, and
the terrible endeavors of humanity.  Marie’s fiction
winds through the despairing and laughing shapes of
the world, observing and calculating toward a
discovery that remains unrealized beyond those forms.
Each has found an ageless voice and will lead us, as
audience, into the unlit stretches.

Please, join us for the reading and post-reading
celebration.

Warmly,

Danielle, Dave, Greg, Katy, and Matt

I hesitate to hurl myself like a playing card on the cinders of this =
tired
old topic, but oh well here goes...
=20
As Jesse Glass and Rich Newman have explained very well, the generally
agreed-upon answer is no, "Jap" is NOT a desirable short form for =
"Japanese."
The three-letter abbreviation for Japan the country is "Jpn," which you =
will
see on your tv screen during the Olympics and in global business
correspondence. YES, WWII is long over, but NO the memory of that war is =
not
over for many many people on this planet. YES the collective cultural =
memory
of "Jap" being applied as a racist and insulting epithet is still very =
fresh
in the minds of not only Japanese and Japanese Americans, but of anyone =
(like
myself) who might be seen as a susceptible target of such an epithet, =
and of
anyone who might think of using such an epithet (with the full power of =
all
its epithetic associations) against a susceptible target, as I have
personally seen done through the 1980s, nearly half a century after V-J =
Day.
NO the individuals who used this term and similar terms against me in a
disparaging manner did not remember WWII and were in fact too young by =
far to
have even come close to living through WWII, but they had a stunning and
(Alexander S. might consider) precocious command of language, precocious
enough to grasp the historically derogatory connotations of a certain
three-letter word and to use it for that very power. NO this does not =
mean
that people (like Steve D. and his wife) can't use this same word in =
casual
off-the-cuff descriptive speech, as possibly an insider's game of =
detourning
and subverting historical stereotypes, but YES the insider/outsider =
context
of such a detournment must be well understood by both speaker and =
audience
and if not it must be questioned and explained, as has been done on this =
list
over the past few days. NO the word "Jap" will not be erased of its =
negative
context and acquire neutral status anytime soon, and NO the status of a =
word
in culture can't/won't obey the outcome of an intellectual debate =
however
well-thought-through or well-intentioned, but is instead dependent on
practice, on the usage of that word in culture based on agreements =
between
and among individuals; and so YES Alexander by all means don't take my =
word
for it, don't take Jerrold's or Jesse's or Rich's word for it, but test =
your
hypothesis out in the street, particularly in your local Japantown or
Chinatown or in the alleys of Shinjuku if you enjoy travel, and gather =
your
data as you may...

About The Bands:

They Shoot Horses, Don't They?
Shindig finalists and Vancouver residents They Shoot Horses, Don't They?
are a hillbilly art rock band from Vancouver British Columbia.

Self described as an Ã¢â‚¬Å“Old Root-A-Ma-Toot bandÃ¢â‚¬Â They Shoot horses has
grown a reputation for their amazing live shows and off kilter brand of
demented poppy art-rock. Playing along such notable acts as Ã¢â‚¬ËœI am
world trade CenterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe UnicornsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ - They Shoot Horses are a
band not to be missed.

Hank Pine & Lily Fawn
Hank Pine and Lily Fawn are a vaudeville-inspired duo from Victoria,
British Columbia, whose act is based upon the tragic and hilarious
adventures of their comic book series. Like the great acts of old, the
music covers many genres, yet all stems from a punk rock ethic, and an
appreciation for the delicate art of entertaining.

Hank is a tall, dark, and mysterious figure in goggles and a mask that
carries his dead girlfriend around in a garbage bag, plays the cello,
keyboards, guitars, ukulele, accordion, drums and whatever else he can
get his hands on.

Lily, a half-deer, half-human forest creature, that tap-dances and plays
the musical saw, the trumpet, the theremin, the flute, and hits the
drums like a six-foot sledgehammer.

This debut double album, "The Road to New Orleans..." serves as a
soundtrack to the first two issues of their comic book, and showcases
both their adoration of all music forms and manic sense of humour.

David Chenery & The Lonesome Valley Singers
David Chenery grew up with cop stories and small town rumours of murder.
In his late teens, he began to adapt sixties pop songs by groups like
the Box tops, The Zombies and Lulu into screeching, obnoxious punk-rock,
causing bar regulars to throw beer bottles and bar managers to cry. By
the age of twenty-three, he felt it was time to leave the boredom of
rural B.C., and headed to the concrete pastures of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe garden
cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Victoria B.C, where he planted some tenuous roots.
While attending film school, David discovered the sounds of artists like
The Carter Family and Hank Williams. Hearing this music transformed him
from a punker-than-thou Misfits aficionado to a writer of traditional
country arrangements, and he began to focus his creative energy into the
composure of sweeping death-ballads.

In late 2003, David released his debut album, entitled "Tonight IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll
Be Singing In The Devils Choir" with his merry band of degenerates The
Lonesome Valley Singers. In the brief window of time since, David has
completed a modest tour of Western Canada and opened for a plethora of
well-known artists, including Smog, Elevator to Hell, and underground
Canadian icon Dale Morningstar and has recently revived his music with a
new line-up of Lonesome Valley Singers notably including
Singer/songwriter Chelsea Wakelyn, Former Sensitone & Mondegreen, Martin
Courchane.

Recently David & The Lonesome Valley Singers have released the highly
acclaimed follow-up to The DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choir album, entitled Memorial.

JENNIFER MOXLEY, OFTEN CAPITAL
First published as two separate chapbooks in 1995 and 1996, OFTEN CAPITAL
explores the tensions between political commitment and personal desire.
Moxley draws in part on the love letters of the Polish radical Rosa
Luxemburg in searching out a habitable space for resistance. Moxley
employs techniques of collage and juxtaposition as well as narration to
sound her subject. Yet the lean, sonorous lines that result leap out of
any categorical dichotomies: "our imagined finish line / is the end of
reason, the irresistible tantalization / of presence, lips pressed
together open / to eat..."


JOHN TIPTON, SURFACES
SURFACES is John Tipton's first full-length collection of poems. Here
is a world of Cartesian precision, where matrices and Markov chains
are revealed by the lattice of snowfall and the improbable order of
ants. Yet the irrational and the absurd are not exiled from these
poems, warping and defining their contours instead: "here the
geography is the horizon here / Oklahoma moves him in ways he
regrets."


JOHN TAGGART, PASTORELLES
In PASTORELLES, John Taggart draws on the local culture of rural
Pennsylvania to consider the permutations of the human mark. An
abandoned one-room schoolhouse, a page from an accounting ledger, a
covered bridge still in use: each offers a "glance / perhaps all that
was ever possible" into what persists. With wry humor, these poems
attend to the ecology of language in a season of drought.


TOM PICKARD, THE DARK MONTHS OF MAY
In part a chronicle of misfortune and heartbreak, THE DARK MONTHS OF
MAY tells of life on the run. With his characteristic bawdiness and
sonic aplomb, Pickard seeks refuge in the geography of British border
ballads, accompanied by eighteenth-century horse thieves and
"desperate reprobates." There, he finds only cold consolation: "leave
me now and let me sleep / your thieving words are all I'll keep."

REMOVED FOR FURTHER STUDY brings together new writing on the British
poet Tom Raworth by 24 poets and critics from both sides of the
Atlantic, four previously uncollected texts by the poet, and a
detailed bibliography. The contributors are: David Ball, cris cheek,
Ian Davidson, Nate Dorward, Ken Edwards, Gunnar Harding, Anselm
Hollo, Fanny Howe, Doug Lang, J. C. C. Mays, Peter Middleton, Alan
Munton, Tom Orange, Marjorie Perloff, Simon Perril, Joan Retallack,
Peter Robinson, Claude Royet-Journoud, Robert Sheppard, Ron Silliman,
Jonathan Skinner, Keith Tuma, Ben Watson and John Wilkinson. REMOVED
FOR FURTHER STUDY provides a fresh and engaging set of responses to
the work of one of the major poets of our time.


MAGGIE O'SULLIVAN, PALACE OF REPTILES
The long-awaited followup to O'Sullivan's IN THE HOUSE OF THE SHAMAN
(1993), PALACE OF REPTILES is a dance and a ritual conducted in
language, a plumbing and sounding-out of buried histories and
vocabularies. Ranging from the brief and beautiful "Ellen's Lament"
to the central long poem "DOUBTLESS," the eight poems of this book
touch on multiple genres --- elegy, celebration, performance art,
poetics talk-in order to transform them.


ALLEN FISHER, ENTANGLEMENT
This is the first book-length showing of Allen Fisher's work of the
1990s and 2000s, drawing together previously uncollected work from
the ongoing project GRAVITY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SHAPE. ENTANGLEMENT
is a meditation on loss, damage and noise, as sources of harm and as
sites of unpredictability and creativity. For Fisher, art is
transformation, and in these poems --- clashing, combining, recombining,
moving restlessly from Piers Plowman to Kurt Cobain to genetic
engineering --- such transformation is ultimately a form of healing.

"This notion that the United States is getting ready to attack Iran is
simply ridiculous. Having said that, all options are on the table," Bush
said

Is this something like "double-talk"?

"It's ridiculous to say I am getting ready to kill you. Having said that,

Or is one being shortsighted, overly freaked out and a few other things

Oy! Here comes the gun.

Pamela,
Yes, both Jesse Glass and Rich Newman provided interesting responses =
(except of course for Richard's "Yellow Hordes" which suggested that one =
article in the NY Times bespeaks a national attitude, a bit of a one =
swallow does not a summer make point,  but, appropriate none the =
less...): "Hell No!" Is the answer to the question as posed, don't say, =
"Jap!" =20

And, obviously, your personal experiences underscore their answers.  You =
agree, "Hell No, Don't use the word!"

I've been intrigued by the responses, in that they support the idea that =
the ultimate meaning of any communication lies not with the sender of a =
message, but rather with the receiver...I may intend no slur or =
derogatory meaning, but you hear the word as such, and so, the negative =
meaning is present.=20

And that point too I find interesting, for it suggests that the reader's =
deconstruction of any piece reduces the piece to it's essence of =
meaning...at least from the reader's/listener's/viewer's point of view.  =
Perhaps Jacques Derrida makes more sense than some would think.=20

Thanks for the thoughts
Alex =20

  I hesitate to hurl myself like a playing card on the cinders of this =
tired
  old topic, but oh well here goes...
  =20
  As Jesse Glass and Rich Newman have explained very well, the generally
  agreed-upon answer is no, "Jap" is NOT a desirable short form for =
"Japanese."
  The three-letter abbreviation for Japan the country is "Jpn," which =
you will
  see on your tv screen during the Olympics and in global business
  correspondence. YES, WWII is long over, but NO the memory of that war =
is not
  over for many many people on this planet. YES the collective cultural =
memory
  of "Jap" being applied as a racist and insulting epithet is still very =
fresh
  in the minds of not only Japanese and Japanese Americans, but of =
anyone (like
  myself) who might be seen as a susceptible target of such an epithet, =
and of
  anyone who might think of using such an epithet (with the full power =
of all
  its epithetic associations) against a susceptible target, as I have
  personally seen done through the 1980s, nearly half a century after =
V-J Day.
  NO the individuals who used this term and similar terms against me in =
a
  disparaging manner did not remember WWII and were in fact too young by =
far to
  have even come close to living through WWII, but they had a stunning =
and
  (Alexander S. might consider) precocious command of language, =
precocious
  enough to grasp the historically derogatory connotations of a certain
  three-letter word and to use it for that very power. NO this does not =
mean
  that people (like Steve D. and his wife) can't use this same word in =
casual
  off-the-cuff descriptive speech, as possibly an insider's game of =
detourning
  and subverting historical stereotypes, but YES the insider/outsider =
context
  of such a detournment must be well understood by both speaker and =
audience
  and if not it must be questioned and explained, as has been done on =
this list
  over the past few days. NO the word "Jap" will not be erased of its =
negative
  context and acquire neutral status anytime soon, and NO the status of =
a word
  in culture can't/won't obey the outcome of an intellectual debate =
however
  well-thought-through or well-intentioned, but is instead dependent on
  practice, on the usage of that word in culture based on agreements =
between
  and among individuals; and so YES Alexander by all means don't take my =
word
  for it, don't take Jerrold's or Jesse's or Rich's word for it, but =
test your
  hypothesis out in the street, particularly in your local Japantown or
  Chinatown or in the alleys of Shinjuku if you enjoy travel, and gather =
your
  data as you may...

Not to belabor this, but I guess I do want to be clear: My "yellow hordes"
comment was not based on a single article in the NY Times, but on responses
in other media as well, and also on conversations with people, not a few of
whom were my students. Even then, you may be right that my sample does not
necessarily bespeak an overtly expressed national attitude. My point was
that the cultural stereotypes are there under the surface for people to tap
into for whatever reason they might wish to.

Best--

>> on the left you're watching the recent revolution in the ukraine on the
right the end of empire signalled by the presence of
infinite viewpoints berlin 1939 new york 2002 in the middle anya warming up

anya goes into a trance. everything disappears. the world remains outside
of anya. nothing is inside anya. nothing.


anya believe in the world but the world is not there and anya is there in
the world.

this is the beginning of everything in the show which is not everything in
the world.

you can see
you can see how the computer makes me make mistakes

in america at the moment we are a divided nation but we are the strongest
nation in the world and 2 into one is one half. we are one half of a
nation we are crippled. in a book I am currently reading by Stefan Zweig
there is a crippled girl and the motto of the book is

beware of pity.
we are at an impasse. we are lost.

i cannot see 'what i am typing' or if i see 'what i am typing' i do not
see my speech and do not hear my speech. you have one or the other one you
either speak or you are spoken to. in the history of empire, it's one or
the Other: you speak or you are spoken to.

there is no speech in dance. there is nothing in dance, absolutely
nothing. there is the body and the body is nothing.

now about these people.

these people want you to know something about them.
these people are the victims of a 'massacre.'
i put 'massacre' in quotation marks because who can tell
what is a massacre
and what isn't?
it's all confused. fox news says it isn't a massacre. cbc says it is.
abc nbc cbs say wait and see who knows if it's a massacre or not.
very many people have died!
they are people of all colors!
they have different shapes.

animals have different shapes too and there are many dead animals.

I bet you didn't know animal species are disappearing at the rate of three
to four AN HOUR on the planet! not individual animals, but entire species.

humans are one species and they're still around. if they weren't around I
bet there'd be more species! I'd bet a lot.

but back to the massacre. maybe a lot of humans died. we don't even count
animals. did you know that hundreds of thousands of birds - birds - died
during the World Trade Center bombing and its aftermath?

after the bombing and the building collapse, a year later, there were
memorials -

huge columns of light!
beautiful light, incredible light!
where the world trade center was wonderful light!
the light went through - right through - the migration paths of birds!
50,000 *ti y try typing inthe dark!) - fifty thousand birds died because
of the light! seventeen times as many people as died in the world trade
center! it was a terrific memorial!

anya dances and she doesn't know what or why she's dancing or what the
machine is doing just outside the studio or why those people on the right
are just broken up like that.

she doesn't have a clue.
things fall apart, but the book is based on africa.
late at night i can't sleep. i have nightmares.

in this war, now, 150000 iraqi have been killed and many americans and
people of other nations and in the last iraqi war 165000 wwere killed,
beween father and son that is over 300000 people and hiroshima, the
dropping of the bomb, killed how many, perhaps 150000 killed. how many
romani were killed in world war two. how many armenians early on. when did
the species start disappearing.

i was asked to do a piece about death and i did a piece about birth and
death they are not the same but they are conne3ct and they are connect to
sex this is connect to sex this is the film over and over until you want
the body to disappear.

when a species disappear you know it's really gone, nothing can bring it
back, not all the dna banks in the world.

i'm sorry about this. i should tell you what i know about normal illinois. well there is hot water in the men's room. i know that for a fact because i tried the faucet and it went lukewarm on me. but i didn't wait for it to get hot, i didn't have time. but i'm sure it would do that if i had waited. the monument in the image is to the dead from siberia in 1031.

that was 1931.

these are the dead but things are falling apart.

you can't bury them and you can't carry on much longer. it's as if the
body's been taken away by inscription. inscription of empire. but we can
reclaim bodies, write on them:

but what we write on each other is only of interest to the censors! it
doesn't matter. what we're saying doesn't matter. it's like the koranic
interlude of reason. have you read the koran? avicenna? averroes? have you
read the bible? the sutras? upanishads?

have you written on your body? in the midst of the most secret dreams of
the world have you written on your body? in your nightmares? tattoos?
something deeper, more private? written on the inside? operations? plastic
surgeries? ways to stay alive?

in this piece of the bodies there are five cameras. the sound triggers the
cameras and creates the edits. the sound is making the movie.

now in this piece, nothing is doing the edits. it's just a shamanic body
in midair.

it's just a woman cut by glass.
she's moving the way i tell her to.
she's wearing whatever i tell her to
i told her not to wear anything at all.

now there's a skeleton behind the shaman and the shaman is controlling the
skeleton or the skeleton is controlling the shaman because the skeleton is
her animal.

i didn't tell her to dance this way but someone else did. how, alan, is
that possible. because someone else worked the machinery that made the
movements so she coulddance. and if someone else didn't work the machinery
she wouldn't move at all. she's a file and you can kill her by entering
"delete" although she's also a file and you can kill her by entering
"kill."

Hello, my object.

Kathy Acker wouldcalll this the empire of the senseless.

See wha happens, there's a glitch in the presentation - why not? and
everyone gets restless. time for lunch! or maybe say something or other, I
don't know, what would you say? this stuff is pretty weird, I'm not sure
what he's getting at, he seems to have forgotten the massacres, is it him
or the computer thats acting up, doesn't he know how to use punctuation.
damn, it just slowed again, all by itself.... just so you know this is
actually a conversastion between Sandy Baldwin and myself on the
fundamental difference between analog and digital regimes in the world.

but it got changed in the process, I don't think Sandy even knows it
sounded like this.

honest, there were no changes at all. we were busy watching these
creatures doing their thing near the ceiling.

this is what we were doing.

these made the stick imagery you see on the left. the stick imagery made
files. the files were imported into a program that clothed them into
avatars. the avatars were played against background images edited in
another program.

we can send shortly. this is stuff that was shot in the evergaldes. we had
to escape people in miami, i think anyone in their right mind would want
to escape people in miami, so we weent to the everglades. we were there in
the middle of the night talking with snakes and alligators and in the
daytime wading through stuff and taking photographs of just about
everything. it's not entertainment but it's the best we've got.

the dancer will dance for you for a little bit and we will end this piece
called
"The Derailment of Massacre"
which pretty much sums things up.
thank you and for questions now.
(somewhere along the way i got lost

i was lost -- there were rows and rows of detainees and more being

marched hands over head in a line -- clusters of women with small

children and elderly trickled out unescorted and were shown to waiting

buses-- i had been handed over to a plains clothes policeman who

finally found my digital photo camera -- the idea of losing another

camera in one day put me in a panic -- i told him just to take the card

out and give me back the camera again and again -- he went through

every little pocket and had all these scraps of paper i had forgot to

throw away with phone numbers and addresses of people who had nothing

to do with anything and put my passport and my camera in a separate

plastic bag with these things -- i kept asking if he could cut off the

plastic cuffs and replace them -- he just wandered away with my bag

after placing a guard right over my head -- a couple dogs were on the

lose and one came close and he kicked it -- the militarty police kept

yelling insults and kicking people who were sitting on the ground --

the pain in my back was making it hard to sit but if i relaxed at all

it would push on my hands andthe pain would shoot into me -- the hard

brazilian sun was beating down and i was sweating hard -- i looked up

and there was a local companero from indymedia pointing at me -- he

wasnt even in cuffs -- they came over and he started explaining we were

together -- what an incredible relief -- i wasnt alone -- soon another

was discovered -- his video camera had also been stolen -- they cut off

my cuffs and my whole body sighed -- we were separated from the mob

scene and placed in neutral territory baking in the sun between the

prisoners and a tent where the hard core military police were in the

shade celebrating their victory -- they would come marching out in

formation singing songs -- it was twisted i looked in some of their

eyes and there was just darkness -- it was like they had no souls, cold

hard steel killers-- i saw other undercover police with a computer and

some really young ones getting into a car -- there was a lot of talk of

infiltration the days before -- time crawled -- eventually we were

placed on a bus with all the other prisoners -- i coulnt figure out

which was worse for us, being isolated or lost in the herd -- but with

the other imcistas i was calmed -- at the police station it was mayhem

-- paperwork took forever -- we were led to an area turned into a

medical station -- there were pools of blood on the floor starting to

turn black at the edges -- people were getting stiches for head wounds

-- i saw a guy with bandages all over his head caked in blood -- he

described a bullet passing through his scalp -- he was refusing more

medical treatment --- he looked scared -- there was movement everywhere

and every available space was utilized with scores of prisoners -- it

was a much more mellow scene -- there was a journalist who spoke

english and i told her i was beaten and they stole my camera but no one

say it on the news -- i got a  medical check and slowly slowly we made

our way to the federal police -- i was the only foreigner -- as we

drove out there were other imcistas outside trying tofigure out were we

were off to -- there were crowds of young people who had gone to school

that day and were gloomily waiting for their parents -- looking at them

they could be from anywhere, any class and country, all clean and in

their nice clothes with book bags -- we sped away -- at the federal

police the snails pace continued as they argued about my visa -- i had

a tourist vias but they said i was working as a journalist -- we

explained that my work with the imc was completely unpaid -- they said

they were going to cut me loose with a court date in june -- ok -- then

they wanted to go copy all the photos in my camera -- this took about 3

hours and suddenly i was buzing away out of there and ready to pass out ----

so many stories to tell -- i only have written about what i saw so far

but now i need to write about the witness accounts -- people said they

saw bodies being dragged to the water wells and dumped, they saw bodies

thrown into burning buildings -- no one knew how many were still

missing -- all night there were military ambulances leaving the

encampment -- all night imc volunteers were at the hospitals and these

ambulances never arrived -- a massive orchestrated coverup was underway

while i collapsed that night -- people working in the hospitals were

afraid to talk with us -- they were already bulldozing houses -- in the

jail so called leaders were being selectivle pulled into special

holding for interogation -- children still looking for their parents --

streams of refugees -- there was no government plan what to do with

these people -- the next morning there was a gathering called for at

the catholic church -- i asked if the police would be there waiting and

a friend said never, after what happened the day before, this was the

center of the city -- there was a sound system and people scattered

everywhere in and out of the church sleeping -- most of them didnt even

have a change of clothes -- i talked to many who had their money, their

identification and their cell phones stolen -- everyone was hungry --

was takijng pictures and say a gathering near the alter and it looked

like they were distributing food -- i walked up and there were two open

caskets -- it was more than i could handle -- they were floating in

pools of flowers and surrounded by loved ones crying -- little children

didnt seems to understand -- one had pictures of he and his wife,

hisnew home in the encampment, them on a vacation -- so proud and full

of life -- the other had strange marks on his hand and everyone told me

they were the initals of the policeman who killed him -- some kind of

weird trophey marking -- i was spilling out and dizzy i stumbled away

and cried -- they could have been anyone, they could have been me --

the police said they died shooting eachother and the corporate media

repeated it unquestioned -- the two official deaths -- outside there

was a huge line waiting to report missing people -- their faces -- i

turned away -- there was some distribution of clothing and soap and

bread but it was a mad house people pushing and desperate clutching

babies -- i went with a friend who said she was getting food at the

market for the church kitchen -- i went to a safe house to rest a while

and people came running in to tell me about the attack -- undercover

police had infiltrated the rally that started at the church and had

grabbed on of the so called leaders to arrest him -- the people werent

having it and started to fight for their companero -- the undercovers

pulled out their guns shooting in the air and were barely able to flee

the scene running into a forming block of military police who were

suspiciously near by in large numbers -- the community was there for a

funeral -- despite the gunplay they assembled for a march carrying the

caskets to a huge park then buses took them to the cemetary -- after

the funeral the buses went to the mayors office and everyone camped out

for hours -- a storm was brewing black clouds in the distance and the

wind kicked hard -- there were different proposals on the loudspeaker

and people decided to go to two gymnasiums set aside for housing --

what a dark night

pamela do you think the term japs which is a negative  developed in ww2
and which i used in passing but not really to start another stupid racial
argument on this list
really
has anything to do with detourning?  as in detourne-3d text???

i took detourning to mean the subverting of say advertising text
reconfiguring it reusing the text like a cutup  no/?

as i stated to jesse privately if we perhaps did what lenty bruce
suggested and stopped putting so much emphasis on these negatives  we
could reduce their impacts
instead of the way we've travelled in the late 20th century with
political correctness
as the way to go
and i think most of us on this list know the values of usage and what is
meant by what is expressed  do we do this because we write and just have
morbid needs to continually play with language and dissect the meaning
until as lenny bruce would have put it
   but in diff words         it is made impotent and no longer dangerous

or because we are so damned liberal and so continually afraid of hurting
eachothers feelings tho we seem to do it constantly on this list
or so afraid of hurting the rest of the worlds' feelings
be it jesse's  or some unknown real world out there
that most of us don't even live in

or is it like that george carlin joke ?
the words we  can't say on the air

No fewer than nine books by Thompson were ranked among the top 100
best-selling books on Amazon.com yesterday. On Barnes & Noble.com, seven
titles were on the top-100 list.

Unfortunately for readers, most of the titles were temporarily sold out,
with delivery times ranging from two days to two weeks.

I think Pamela explained eloquently enough why these
words and other words, invested with intense
historical weight, are difficult to use no matter the
coding of the present user. and it is always lame when
it is a non-asian or non-african, etc (if I can make
the assumption) who defends its use.

you may have all sorts of high theories of the use of
the word, but not the people who are listening to you
(on this list or in the streets of New York, as Pamela
advised to experiment).

lame at best. at worst criminal. if not actually then
in its effect.

I was just reading about the Kundiman Foundation's
Vincent Chin chapbook award and then I have to come on
this poetics list and listen to debate about whether
or not "jap" has outgrown its historical connotation
of racism? Appalling.

If I asked every subscriber to this list, directly, if they cared what I
think of the word "Jap," I bet not one could honestly say "yes."

It might technically be a wordsmithing issue, but until someone can say
something I haven't heard 100 times in a bar, I ain't seein' no
intellectualism in it.

ive been skipping this thread, being busy, and i'm not sure why i looked =
at this message; and i dont know where youre coming from on it, tho it =
seems to be an odd place

in reply to your unasked question, i think Jap is an offensive word, as =
such contractions often are, I mean likely to cause offence to those it =
describes - my offence derives from that

I hear it in wwii films as a run up to japanese being killed. In the =
context of the film, I am not saying the killing is wrong; but the use =
of it is part of the process of saying it's ok to kill them. They're not =
Japanese, they're not human beings, theyre not sons, daughters, spouses, =
theyre japs. Get the fly spray someone. In war it is a way of helping =
people commit the repugnant act of murder by verbally dehumanising the =
victims. The effects of such abuse hang around in the soil of things, =
like agent orange

I hear Australians call themselves Aussies / Ozzies, so I assume they =
are happy with it. I never hear Japanese calls themselves Japs. I assume =
they are not happy with it. Any Japanese person I have spoken to who =
thinks it necessary to identify their country has always said "I am =
Japanese"

I class Jap as a demeaning-in-intent and sometimes racist coinage

I don't know if that is intellectual enough.

It is also what you call a wordsmithing issue, of course.

Perhaps it is true that no one would care enough to say anything of
what you THINK of the word "Jap", but it's clear that there are lots
of opinions about your USE of the word "Jap". If you kept what you
think of the word "Jap" to yourself, and also didn't use the word,
then the issue would not arise. But once you use the word you
necessarily open the issue of others' opinions of the word, the use
of the word in general, and your use of it in particular.

It may be that in the bars you prefer "Jap" and "nigger" and "wop"
and "spic" and "cunt" and the like are all thrown about with
enthusiasm and, because no Americans of Japanese, African, Italian,
or Hispanic ancestry go there, and the women are economically
dependent on white guys who call them "cunts", you get no objection.

The general rule in civilized discourse is to refer to individuals
and to groups of people by the terms that those individuals and those
groups of people do not object to.

Perhaps you're not frequenting the right bars. Why not try your
theory out in bars where there are a lot of Americans of Japanese
ancestry? Report back to us here when you get out of the hospital.

i'm not sure i understand this discussion. the term "jap" is
offensive, period.  doesn't everyone know this?  i can't believe it
has garnered serious debate here.

I agree overall - but  I think it is a peccadilo - - lets not forget what
the Japs did in WW2 - and they still have ambitions -- lets not get too PC
about everything ...

My mother -a  good and a very English person, gentle , called the Japanese
"Japs" - on Ocean Island friends were killed -  Jap is just  a shortened
form - (killing isnt good if it can be avoided)  - I knew one Kiwi bloke who
hated Japs - really hated them from his war experience - - of course one
Imperialism pushing away another - but they also called the islanders
"natives" they didnt mean anything by it - it was a habit of the
colonialists - Maori here were called "natives" and for a long time were not
allowed to speak Maori -all sorts of things - trivial or non trivial facts
etc - creep out of the wood work..

Dont say it!!

When i was young I thought that it didnt matter if black people were
killed - seen too many Tarzan films or cowboy and Indian films etc - Maori
just seemed to me to be in another world.....kind of thought they didnt feel
pain etc ... in some ways that is still the case - the are in some ways in a
foreign land if they  are my neighbbours...there is quite a distance
Pakeha - Maori etc
I am Eurocentric - although  I try to resist that aspect of myself..it keeps
pushing through..as do other prejudices I have...although I think at my
grandfather was London Jew

Definitions -  English = good.  British (in the old Imperial) "sense" = bad.
So Britain is still an Imperailist and on (technical but no longer an
imperialist nation in the old sense  - coloniser  as such (transformered to
modern day Imperialism) - and the English are good people who drink tea and
have scones and live in cottages in the Cotswolds etc - THAT is MY England


Kiwi =  good person.

Kiwi is used all the time by all New Zealanders we say Kiwis are  this kiwis
are that rather than New Zealanders - "you are a real kiwi" is heard often
or "kiwi kids" etc - kiwi and or fucking sheep references is are not
offensive - actaully i think there are more sheep in the UK (Old Blighty)

I hear it in wwii films as a run up to japanese being killed. In the context
of the film, I am not saying the killing is wrong; but the use of it is part
of the process of saying it's ok to kill them. They're not Japanese, they're
not human beings, theyre not sons, daughters, spouses, theyre japs. Get the
fly spray someone. In war it is a way of helping people commit the repugnant
act of murder by verbally dehumanising the victims. The effects of such
abuse hang around in the soil of things, like agent orange

I hear Australians call themselves Aussies / Ozzies, so I assume they are
happy with it. I never hear Japanese calls themselves Japs. I assume they
are not happy with it. Any Japanese person I have spoken to who thinks it
necessary to identify their country has always said "I am Japanese"

I class Jap as a demeaning-in-intent and sometimes racist coinage

I don't know if that is intellectual enough.

It is also what you call a wordsmithing issue, of course.

That's a valid argument. Of extreme curiosity to me is the fact that I DID
keep my opinion of the word "Jap" to myself, yet you assumed, for reasons
I'd be interested in hearing about, that you knew what that opinion was.
In fact, I have used the word only to verbally roll my eyes at the debate
surrounding it.

Again, you have assumed a "theory" when I have offered none. I have
certainly used the word "cunt" in both white- and blue-collar lesbian
bars, because there is a movement to liberate it. I've survived. I know of
no movement to liberate the word "Jap," but you are correct in guessing
I've never been to a Japanese bar, though I suspect I would find your
reasons for guessing this skewed. There's no large movement to liberate
the word "spic,"  though the Sephardi really should, and I certainly know
the difference between the words "nigger" and "nigga." If I am
hospitalized for using one of these words, I will acknowledge my error.
Regardless, I remain as apathetic about your opinion of the word "Jap" as
you are about mine, imaginary or real.

  The Japanese who committed war crimes in WW2 are at the least very old.
Many are dead and do not have ambitions by definition.

I do not see that calling any still living by an offensive name is justified
morally or of any advantage. At best it will create discord. Calling all
Japanese by an offensive name is not acceptable. Calling individuals by
racist names is not acceptable. If they are murderers, say murderers etc

It would be more appropriate to remember what was done to Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, a war crime which has never been tried; ambitions to repeat that
exercise somewhere - anywhere - remain with us; but I do not wish to insult
all the people in the countries whose governments might develop such plans;
and my own government is quite capable of doing appalling things. I know
because they are doing appalling things.

Using references to being PC or not being PC leads to confusion. It muddies
the water and blurs the distinction between ridiculous activities and
thought through activies Take each issue and event on its merits

In this case and in all cases, let the axiom be Let's not be racist to *any

Part of the problem of taking what you think is an objective view is
persuading your readers that you're doing so -- or at least that
you're trying to. In this instance it seems as if you're defending
the notion that the word "Jap" is non-pejorative, and not as if
you're verbally rolling your eyes at the debate surrounding it --
especially when you say such things as:

"It might technically be a wordsmithing issue, but until someone can
say something I haven't heard 100 times in a bar, I ain't seein' no
intellectualism in it."

That seems straightforward in its view that the assertion that "Jap"
is offensive is merely wordsmithing, and not intellectually supported
at all. It seems straightforward in its view that "Jap" is non-
pejorative.

Jonathan Penton wrote:
> ... you have assumed a "theory" when I have offered none.<

It seems to me that you have indeed offered one, and the one you seem
to me to have offered is that there is no good argument you've seen
here or in a hundred bars that persuades you that "Jap" is a
pejorative term.

Hi everyone,

I thought you might like to know about the
organization Kundiman, a wonderful new group promoting
Asian-American poetry. This past year they sponsored a
chapbook award in the name of Vincent Chin.

Here's the URL:

http://www.kundiman.org/index.php?id=3

According to Kundiman's website:

"On June 19, 1982, in Detroit, Vincent Chin was beaten
to death with a baseball bat by a man and his stepson.
The two laid-off autoworkers mistook Chin for Japanese
— an Asian group they blamed for the ailing U.S. auto
industry. The assailants never served jail time, and
later federal civil-rights courts acquitted them
entirely of the crime.

For many today, this is a rarely remembered footnote
in American history. However, the tragedy of Vincent
Chin marked an important change in how Asian Americans
viewed themselves. It was the first time, according to
APA advocates and academics, that people who traced
their ancestry to different countries in Asia and the
Pacific Islands crossed ethnic and socioeconomic lines
to fight [politically] as a united group of Asian
Pacific Americans. They were Chinese, Japanese,
Korean, and Filipino; they were waiters, lawyers, and
grandmothers who were moved to action by what happened
to Vincent Chin.

For the first time, Asian Americans banded together
against the discrimination and racism directed toward
the APA community.* Decades later, the need for Asian
Americans to unite as a population and to project a
voice into the cultural mainstream is as urgent as
ever.

In honor of Vincent Chin and this watershed moment in
Asian American history, Kundiman and Manoa have
established The Vincent Chin Memorial Chapbook Prize.
This annual prize is an opportunity for both Kundiman
and Manoa to support and spotlight the talent of an
emerging Asian American poet, a new voice in the
landscape of Asian American expression and power."


I would also like to say that though I have not
traditionally been very vocal on this list, I always
read with interest the discussions that happen here.
I'm really scandalized by the casual way that these
hate-words appear in posts and title lines to posts.
It's incendiary, it's rude, and not to repeat myself,
it's frankly scandalous. I would very much like it to
stop as it is creating an unfriendly, unsafe, racist
environment.

K

"And they still have ambitions" -- LOVE that one, after all, those
tricky Japanese are shifty-eyed, inscrutable, slippery types, aren't
they?

You keep sliding deeper into your own ordure-flavored ice-cream mind,
Richard.

And I agree with Maria Damon -- I can't believe we're talking about
racial/ethnic slurs as if the whole thing was an intellectual issue.
Y'all ought to get out more often.

On March 2 at the Drake Hotel in Toronto Adeena Karasick will be
presenting the Canadian premiere of her poetic trans'elation of the
Sefer Yetzirah (the Kabbalistic Book of Creation) with special guest
bill bissett. The show which premiered to a packed house at New York's
St Marks Poetry Project on December 3rd last year is an amazing
mixture of the modern and the archaic incorporating an intensely
personal, brilliant,  playful, linguistically original
re-interpretation of this classic Kabbalistic text which appears in
her recent book The House that Hijack Built from Talonbooks. As well
there will be the collaged visual projections of Blaine Speigel, a
musical accompaniment of both electronic and archaic Middle Eastern
sound textures with dance music afterwards. There is no cover charge,
there will be some food. Doors will open at 7:30pm, performances will
begin at 8:15pm. We hope to see you all there. The Drake Hotel is at
1150 Queen St W. at Beaconsfield. For more information phone
416-703-7485 or email rkasher@sympatico.ca
Adeena is available for interviews on both her poetry, her show and
the Kabbalah. I've included jpgs of the two tarot cards in case you'd
like to use them in any articles.

On March 4 bill bissett and Adeena Karasick will be doing a major
reading of their poetry including work from the Drake Hotel Show for
the Exchange Rate Reading Series at the Rust Belt Bookstore 202 Allen
Street in Buffalo, NY. They will be reading from their recent books
narrativ enigma/rumours uv hurricane (bill bissett) and The House that
Hijack Built (Adeena Karasick). Both are available for phone
interviews or interviews at the show.

On the I-80 Thruway where it crosses Indiana (once home to the largest Ku
Klux Klan organization) the food/and/gas stops are namesd for famous
Hoosiers. One is the Ernie Pyle Rest Stop. Pyle was a correspondent during
WWII in the Pacific--he gave us the phrase GI Joe, if I'm not mistaken. He
was killed in 1944, as the bronze plaque informs us, "by a Jap sniper."
Amazing. For short time endless monument.

But I also remember colored-only bathrooms.

Depends on what you mean by "what I think about the word Jap," doesn't it?
To the degree that what any of us thinks about a word like that reflects our
ideas about race and language, not to mention history and politics on a
broader scale as well, I'd be willing to bet lots of people on this list
would care quite a lot about what an individual--you, me, whoever--thinks
about that word.

It consistently amazes me that there are people on this list (and I should
be clear, Jonathan, that I am not saying you are one of them) who are
shocked, absolutely shocked!, to find that the meanings of the words they
use are beyond their control, that the words have histories and cultural
contexts that are not always pretty, and these people resent it when they
are asked to hold themselves accountable for their use of such words--and I
don't care whether we're talking about a one-word epithet or the rhetorical
undercurrent of a longer piece of discourse--whether by people for whom the
words resonate in an immediate first-person way, as in Pamela's example of
how some kids used the word Jap against her, or by people who care about the
ways those words resonate period.

It bothers me much less, in other words, that someone would use the word
Jap--because I assume that people on this list are not openly and overtly
racist and therefore I assume the word does not come from a position of
explicitly racial hatred (especially in this case, where the word was
initially used by Steve Dalachinsky, whose wife is Japanese), and because
there are all kinds of reasons why that word might slip into what a person
says--than that this person would resist, as some on this list have done and
continue to do, being accountable and responsible for their use of that, or
any other similar word. We are, after all, poets, and language is supposed
to be our craft and calling, and part of being a writer is being willing to
be held accountable, is to insist on your own responsibility, for what you
write, even, and perhaps especially, when that responsibility is painful to
take.

Alexander,

>>I've been intrigued by the responses, in that they support the idea =
that
>>the ultimate meaning of any communication lies not with the sender of =
a
>>message, but rather with the receiver...I may intend no slur or
>>derogatory meaning, but you hear the word as such, and so, the =
negative

That's certainly one way of looking at it. But I'd say also that the =
message
of the communication is not a matter to be determined solely by either =
sender
intent or receiver experience. I don't think there's an either/or cause. =
In
the memoir/confessional moments I was relating, the message originated
clearly with sender intent, then exploded in receiver experience. Also, =
there
is the third term of the language itself, which acts as a reservoir for
larger historical/cultural forces that are out of either the sender's or =
the
receiver's immediate control. So even if sender and receiver believe =
they are
communicating strictly on a one-to-one personal level, they are still
invoking broad cultural terms and associations inherent in language =
itself.
The nexus of sender, receiver, and language-as-public-medium is what =
creates
the complex meaning or confusion of the message. Hence the politics of
speech. Not that this should stymie spontaneous and expressive =
communication
-- I dislike the strongarm PC police squad as much anyone else. I guess =
I'm
just saying that to use language effectively, one needs to understand as =
much
as possible the nuances of the language being used, and that may often
include additional nuances found outside the disembodied text of the
dictionary definition. Love language, love life!

So in your original queries, I heard not the intention to slur or offend =
a
group, but an intention to downplay the significance of etymology and =
history
in language usage. Which ironically turned the political back over to =
the
personal for me, as I heard an undertone of abstract dismissal with =
respect
to my own experiences.

>>And that point too I find interesting, for it suggests that the =
reader's
>>deconstruction of any piece reduces the piece to it's essence of
>>meaning...at least from the reader's/listener's/viewer's point of =
view.=20
>>Perhaps Jacques Derrida makes more sense than some would think.

Ah but there is no essence of meaning, only excess! I confess now to my =
lack
of direct experience with Derrida's works, but the concept I always =
gleaned
from him (via the trickle-down education of my school years) was this =
one of
excess, of the text's accumulation of meaning over time and over the
collective experience of readers. So that the text is outside the =
author's
control, and outside any one reader's control.. the text must be =
respected
for having a life of its own, which it has earned from being a part of =
the
material of culture. So if I've gotten even halfway close to inferring a
Derridian notion here, yes I agree he is quite relevant to the topic...

At the sweet and usually notably ripe age of 95, is "Dorothea Tanning" still
indeed "emerging",  and as a poet - instead of a painter - no less? I love
it. Somebody does have to claim the "Louise Bourgeois" role in poetry,
n'est-ce pas? I tell you, those surrealists are something else! Marvelous.

Or is somebody already faking that proud name?

Richard, I know you think you're being funny.  I've encountered this kind of
wearisome humour soooo often, and calling its bigotry always garners the
counter accusation that one is a humourless PC drone.  Yawn.  Personally, I
like a bit of wit in my humour.  Even a cruel wit.  Aside from being totally
offensive, this kind of witlessness is monumentally mindnumbingly dull.

This Welcome Message updated 11 January 2005.

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list
carries about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time. A
good number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
(see web-address above).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.  We recognize that other lists
may sponsor other possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium.
We request that those participating in this forum keep in mind the
specialized and focused nature of this project, and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list.  That is, the Poetics List
exists to support and encourage divergent points of view on modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the list
moderators may shift with impunity between this and a pre-review mode
which calls for all messages to be read and approved before being
forwarded to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers
the spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under individual
review, in which case only their messages would be received for
moderators' approval before being forwarded to the list; the list
moderators may also ask subscribers to leave the list if they are not
productively contributing to the discussion. We remain committed to
this editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about
this list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists.
The idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather
than general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list
relatively small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the
list are 50 messages per day, and two messages per subscriber per day.


Further information on posting to the list for subscribers, publishers
and series-coordinators, see sections 5 and 6.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage
posts that announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5
for details.

---------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
All posts to the list should provide your full real name, as
registered. If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it
appears in the "from" line of the message header, please sign your
post at the bottom.  PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information
and correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators at the
lists' administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message
should include all of the required information. All other questions
about subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription or
subscription policy, should be addressed to this same administrative
address.

PLEASE NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROCESS SUBSCRIPTION
REQUESTS.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having messages from the
list returned to us. If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to
request an increased quota from your system administrator.  You might
also consider obtaining a commercial account. In general, if a good
number of Poetics messages are bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this
happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by contacting the moderators
at<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------------------

3. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.  If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics digest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics nohtml index  --or--  set poetics html index

*to temporarily turn off Poetics mail send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics nomail

*to reactivate Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you
are going to be away for any extended period of time.  Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages but
other important mail.

-------------------------

4.  To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options) go to the
right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html  You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then return to your new address and contact the
moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> to resubscribe. If you find
that it is not possible to unsub using your old address, please
contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> for assistance.

----------------------------

5.  Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in
this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
Feel free to query the list moderators if you are uncertain as to
whether a message is appropriate. All correspondence with the
moderators regarding submissions to the list remains confidential and
should be directed to us at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or
in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of
this list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications are always
welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address: <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list to our
administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

----------------

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We
define 'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or
personal insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes
ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than their work is
attacked; in other words while critique of a person's work is welcome
(critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list), this
critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

I think most would agree that the listserv serves as a productive
communal space for discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers
who do not follow listserv policy on flaming will first receive a
warning from the listserv moderator and should they fail to follow
policy again they will immediately be placed on review.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudononymous
subscriptions.  We also discourage the sending of HTML-formatted
messages to the list. All messages intended for the Poetics List
should be sent in Text-Only format.

Please also do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post.  Messages containing attachments
will be presumed to be worm- or virus-carrying and will not be
forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 50 or fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

Apologies, Lori - I'll try to keep my finger off the button in moments of
dudgeon.  Sometimes boredom is a goading thing, but that's no excuse.

Since Dorothea Tanning's name emerged this afternoon as an emerging poet,
Chris Sullivan's blog reminds me of another genius in the surreal 'strip the
chicken of its feathers to bare flesh' visual mode, that is Frederick
Sommer, whose executors have bestowed his works with a foundation and a a
website:
http://www.fredericksommer.org/index.html

If your visual vowels, etc. need cleaning, I recommend the site as a place
to go! It might take awhile to find the chicken parts, but they are
unforgettable.

Tijuana writer and theorist HERIBERTO YEPEZ reading
this Thursday night, FEBRUARY 24
in the Mills Hall Living Room
@ 7:00

(w/ a reception to follow)

Among poets and writers who blog, Mexican writer and translator
Heriberto Yèpez is one of the most provocative voices, writing in both
Spanish and English and about/at the boundary of each language.
Relentless in his questioning of both totalitarian states and the role
of the poet/cultural worker, Heriberto’s aphorisms are an unsettling
salve for the global conditions we find ourselves in: “Poetry is the
power the writer has; the power s/h/e needs to fight, this power
within, not the power we invent as not-related-to-me, the
power-of-the-other, the one I can criticize to be heroic, to be a Poet.
Write against your own act.” Currently a professor of Philosophy at
UABC-Tijuana, Yèpez is the author of several books in Spanish writes in
Mexico City. Some of his writing in English has appeared in U.S.
magazines, including Tripwire, Shark and XCP. He has performed and read
at various U.S. conferences, including Poetry in a Time of Crisis at the
UC Santa Cruz, and the recent Cabinet of the Muses series, sponsored in
part by UC Berkeley and the LAB. You can find him online at
http://www.hyepez.blogspot.com/ and http://mexperimental.blogspot.com/

Here are a few poems by Dorothea Lasky



The first lesson


Earth and earth make air.
Air and air make fire.

Water and fire make
Air, fire, and fire

Or fire, air, and fire.
Depending on how you look at it.

The house on the edge
Was painted in purple.

And there were shells in it
And lacy things.

“Stability is a ghost.” he had said to me.
We were naked.

But still silence is a globe too
Of unhaloed train light.

The light in the street
Is made of purple, heather, and finer things.

And the light is yellow.
And it takes my time to look at it.


_____________________________________________________________________


The Sea Goddesses are Pulling in the Shells in Pink and Green


I almost had a run-in with the nurse.
It would have been just me and the nurse!

She has a beautiful face I’m sure.
You have a beautiful face, but you must know that.

My little animal
Coming to me now so clearly.

Everything you do alone
Must be made out of wood.

The wood glove of dawn.
The wood pies the sun eats

On a luncheon hill
With the friends of God

He gets so clearly along with.
But why must we stop with economy?

The wood pies of Bernadette Mayer are fancy, too.
Even I have known love that was fancy.

But it was for an afternoon and the sun was truly coming in.

The Second Lesson, the Second Appurtenance


In your mouth the soul gapes out.
The dogs gape out.
The men eat grapes.

In your rib, a bird looks out.
The bird is an airbird.
Scratch its head.  It is holy.

In your head is the smallest lion that has ever lived.
Take it out and give it air.  It is dark and damp in your head.
Your brain eats away at the lion.

Outside your body is a set of bleachers.
Look across them, but don’t look at the people.
Trick the men to do sleeping, caress the feet of the women.

For the women are the bodies that will make you come into being.
You will not know this for a long time.
You will sit stupidly and drink milk.

As you requested
I decided on a Vidas instead of a Razo, enjoy--

-------------

Vidas

Ken Rumble, was from the south, a practicioner of the Carolinas, and had
close to one thousand women spread over five counties with two primary
juristictions. He had brothers named G and C each of whom he treated
with vigor, glee and strong offence as if they were Titan or some other
methane gas covered planet to tell jokes of. One of those who sang for
him, his joglar, Lester, was a clever woman dressed as a man in sheeps
clothing of an undeterminable sex near an unprotected open fire pit.

Ken Rumble treated his brothers as if a drug using president trying not
to practise racial profiling by using a gregorian educational calendar
from the early 1800's, a favour which was returned at times earlier in
his days. For this reason, while travelling he always rode in the best
of transport to alleviate fears of missive inadequacy and could oft be
found sulking in a dirty part of town absent of verse.

Ken Rumble boasted a valiancy of such strength that he had no need to
use his wits and therefore oft found himself at the Late Night drive
thru window at Taco Bell instead of eating a home cooked meal with one
of his lovelies. A good singer, troubadour, and pancake maker he was,
nevertheless very faithless. And, unless rubbed elsewhere, he rubbed
elbows with the Cathars of his day. This was quite effective and lead to
a series of peacefully sweet cansos and a general lack of sirventes.

Ken Rumble, for many of the reasons above, made this cobla to share with
all and it goes like this:


                 Communion

                 I crept through your neighbor's yard, careful
                 not to trip the security lights your father
                 installed. Balanced on a nail below your window,
                 I tapped the screen until you slid it up
                 and I slipped in like a burglar. We didn't speak.
                 We pushed off our clothes, lost in learning
                 the circular motion of falling and rising hips.
                 I read your body in the dark with my fingers,
                 tongue, thighs, and palms. The rug burned my knees,
                 your back. We bit our lips, careful
                 not to make a sound, our moans
                 quiet, shallow panting.

                 For months, we watched lights from cars on the road
                 sweep back and forth across the ceiling
                 like searchlights peering through the night.
                 Several hours later, intoxicated
                 on the smell of sex, mothballs, and Chanel, I crept out

                 like a thief, walked home under streetlight
                 after streetlight after streetlight
                 after streetlight and in school
                 I nodded to you in the hall, walked the other
direction,
                 thinking of the bottle of your father's vodka
                 I took that first night. I didn't understand
                 you were teaching me a language:
                 grammar, punctuation, tense, person,
                 possession, agreement, case, infinitive,
                 subject, predicate, and plural.




Be well

The difference between Caleb and Jeran is.

Honey Nut Cheerios open on a heartbeat buckling. Mary
snores sprawled across those lossy climates. I'll make
you read this in certain units that accrete and sound
like struts.

Rat's always pushing at the top of his cage.

Ed is starting a sentence that contains several
nicknames and cultural references.

My wifey rattles gravel I. Tao like what's sour in
under rose petals, in under the rose petals in a box.
Do a short line. Smoke a bowl. My wifey like the Tao
with emotions is an Ohio girl. Like a tom(morrow
fragrant with tapestries, )boy, with smiles that curl
around you, tickle you sloped, tough like folly but
lithe with consonance. Tao skull lurking, doll bulls
in frames of Memphis.

My wifey is furry with hope.

Rough, like a raw honey lozenge.

This really does cross a line, and I am glad the List Administrator has
issued her "gentle reminder," though it's hard to see what Richard Taylor
has done in this post as gentle or funny or witty or as anything other than
blatantly racist, even taking into account that it is probably intended as a
witheringly dismissive response to Christopher Leland Winks'--deservedly in
my opinion--hard-hitting response to Taylor's previous post about the
Japanese still having "ambitions."

It did seem to me that a discussion worth having--about language and meaning
(Pamela's latest response to Alex), about a writer's responsibility to
language and, by implication, to audience as well, and about the nature of
"wordsmithing" (Jonathan Penton's question and my response), and maybe there
were other threads that I have missed (I haven't been reading
everything)--was beginning to emerge here, and it would be a shame if
Richard Taylor's failed attempt at whatever he thought he was attempting (I
will give him the benefit of the doubt that he did not mean this as a
successful example of race baiting) diverted or short-circuited what people
were starting to say.

Interestingly enough, these same issues come up among foreign residents
in Japan who are confronted with "Japanese Only" signs on bath houses,
barber shops, and other public venues, and suffer sexism, racism, and
every other kind of ism in the job market as they attempt to live
productive lives here.  You may keep up with the continuing debate about
this problem by taking a look at the Japan Times on-line version.
We're not talking just about white folks from the U.S. and the U.K.,
but about Chinese, Koreans, Africans, Saudi-Arabians, Iranians,
Iraqis,Brazilians, etc. etc.

Moreover, there are the "hidden holocausts" that happened from
1910--1945 in Korea and for about the same period of time in China,
complete with forced prostitution, enslavement, vivisection, biological
warfare, testing of biological agents on whole villages, attempted
genocide, etc., etc. the extent of which is still being uncovered, and
none of which the Japanese government has begun to apologise for.
There's also the matter of Yasukuni Shrine, which Koizumi insists on
visiting to honor the war dead.  This sounds reasonable enough, until
one sees the place for oneself--then it's obvious that this is a shrine
dedicated to war, and to the Japanese martial spirit, with weapons on
display, etc. etc.  Far from condemning war, the keepers of this shrine
praise it, offering daily prayers to Tojo and the rest.  A bit like the
Germans maintaining a shrine to Hitler.  If you look around you'll see
many of those Old Ones from WWII that Lawrence thinks has passed on to
whatever glory awaits them clapping their hands, bowing their heads,
throwing their coins.  The Japanese have the longest life-expectancy in
the world, and many of those folks are still here fighting the war in
their heads.  I know because I'ive encountered them on the trains and
in the streets and heard from their lips about the "special role in
history" of the Japanese People.  "Nihon #1!"

The Japanese have no qualms about being racist and about throwing around
racist epithets, it's just a fact of life here.  You can see it on
television, hear it on the radio, read it in the textbooks, hear it from
the mouths of the children.  They're not going to change.

That, however, doesn't condone the use of hateful epithets like "Jap"
or like "gaijin," or from the practice of governmentally sanctioned
discrimination based on race, sex, age, etc. Indeed, we, as
non-Japanese, must refrain from doing what the Japanese seem to need to
do to us.  Jesse

"You can only protect your liberties in this world by
protecting the other man's freedom." --_Clarence Darrow_
(http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/clarence_darrow.html)

First, I also agree with Maria Damon, but then part of me also
wants to talk about WHAT drives people to their bigotry.

By the way, I was happy Kazim Ali posted the _Kundiman_
(http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0502&L=poetics&D=1&O=D&F=&S=&P=75566)
link for us in the middle of all this hate.  And frankly I don't
give a fuck if anyone thinks the jokes weren't hate driven,
yes they certainly were.  (if you didn't check out the _Kundiman_
(http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0502&L=poetics&D=1&O=D&F=&S=&P=75566)
link, please do so...posted yesterday)

The extra step after identification of bigotry should always
be Why?  What even, and How does that come out of you?

How are you not filtered, and maybe to say Good, I'm glad
you're not filtered, you're really THAT far out there in accepting
these feelings you have that it comes out of you so easily.
But I think Why is really the hard one.  In fact Why could take
a whole lot of therapy to understand.

I've experienced shades of homophobia on this List more than
once, and frankly I'm fascinated by it.  Not just by the bigotry
itself as it occurs, but the ease of it, the gentle knock on the
door the hammer is capable of to get the door open.  This is
due in part to the general codes that still exist, regardless of
any cultural leaps we think we've made.

It kind of bugs me how people think that JUST because there
are TV programs with positive Queer or Black or Asian characters
that some great milestone has been hit.  Frankly, I believe it  just
means that TV has made progress in its own way with the world,
but we really need to check in with one another before ever accepting
a TV marker.  The fucking antigay vote for the president was  proof
that Will & Grace could air 24 hours a day on all stations and  there
would still be hatred for fags and dykes.

(An aside, I loathe the Will & Grace show, and don't like TV in  general
to be honest.  So maybe that's why I'm so down on accepting the  way
TV is used as a cultural marker.  But the Will & Grace show in  particular
has such class issues that it sets my hair on fire with rage.)

But getting a bigot to taste his own medicine is my favorite tactic,
especially since it's so deliciously unexpected.  After that it
would be nice to figure out what the hell is going on.

MOST IMPORTANT is that bigots get another step, a good step, in
that they really NEED to understand that being ignorant of what is
going on inside them can be dealt with, and that AFTER it is that  they
can be alive in the world again without the stigma.  In fact, it's  really
fucking ESSENTIAL that we do this!  WE NEED TO make room for
people to CHANGE!  And maybe, just maybe, in order to do that,  we
need to allow people the space to vent, to say it all.  Just say  it!

One of the things that has come up in this discussion is how we need
to understand how important the things we say are.

Well I say something a little different in that, on the other side,  the
listening side, we need to not be so AFRAID of the language.  As  long
as no one is getting their head bashed in, then let's hear, and  listen.
And discuss our reactions to what we're taking in.

We're living in a time with leaders who really are sanctifying hate.
It's been given the holy seal of approval.

Anyway, this is long enough of a post,
CAConrad

Subject:      A Question Of Parity
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

A fact: the Japanese who go abroad to the U.S.--and from what I
understand the U.K.-- are afforded every benefit in terms of employment
and protection of personal rights at the workplace, in matters of sexual
harassment, and against other forms of discrimination, etc., but these
protections are not extended to foreign workers (including second and
third generation Japanese-Americans) in Japan.   I (as well as 100's of
workers here) believe that there should be parity in this matter.  These
are not racist observations, this is simply a fact that anyone on this
list can verify.  The Japanese make absolutely no beans about it, they
discriminate on the basis of what they perceive as race, and not only in
private businesses, but in government positions as well.

Just recently a Chinese woman who was raised in Japan and is perfectly
bilingual and acculturated as a Japanese, was not allowed to sit for a
civil service exam for a position in local government.  The reason?  She
is not Japanese!  There are many many examples of this, but apparently
American government is not interested enough to protest.

I believe that the butter should be spread both ways.  It's only fair.
In fact, with the 0 population growth in Japan, it would behoove the
Japanese government to change immigration and employment laws to allow
foreign workers more rights and more protections.  Recently, I heard one
Japanese robotics expert say that Japan is pressing forward to become a
world leader in robotics because of a lack of workers in the future.  Of
course, he meant Japanese workers--apparently the only kind!  Jesse

I have to back Jesse on this; I found the same conditions in Fukuoka.

But I'd love to get back to either talking about poetry/poetics and/or
poetry/poetics presentations here - or a discussion, which might be
useful, why issues of race etc. come up so often on this list. It's not
endemic; it's not happening on others, but it seems to veer in Poetics'
direction.

Meanwhile, after some discussions in Normal, I'd really like to know what
people think of Swinburne; I find him disturbing in a way that's deeply
uncomfortable, valuable as a result.

Yonder Zonging

A boy came deliberately evoking far gaining height in

from gambling his inner juice kicked long mentally
neutered, openly presuming querulous rank so the
users valued weather exonerating youthful zigzags.
Combining death embellished flukes going honorably in
jestful knacks like masterful notes over peppered
quandaries reasonably secure to understand value

flukes gained height inside jocular kicks labored
monthly, not overly presumptuous, quiet, regardless,
so timidly useless, venerated with excessive yearly
zeitgeist. Every far-flung government hides inside
jocular kicks limited masterless, nixing, overtly
precarious, quaintly regarded, seasonally timorous

hideous, innocuous, jocund, kicked limp moreover near

Dog Prizes


Dog prizes do not resemble literary prizes.  Dog prizes regulate the size,
shape and style of dogs. They maintain traditional breed standards. To
have your pet win the grand prize at a dog show is not at all like winning
a literary prize.  To win a dog prize it helps to have a traditional
friend on the judging panel. It helps that throughout the year you deliver
coffee to judges when you see them sitting at ringside. It helps that you
advertise your dog as best' in numerous canine magazines. Literary value
is quite different from kennel-club breed standards, even though
officially recognized' does mean, in doggy language, canonical.' The only
dogs considered for the grand prize are those that are entered, which
leaves a lot of inglorious dogs named Milton languishing at firesides. It
helps that you sit with prospective judges and chat about structural
problems in your competition. About them not being born the colour they
display. About them using illegal substances. Or that you observe sagely
and loudly that some move too slowly. That they are well regarded only in
other countries, or in rural communities. It helps to parade your pet and
his trophies through crowds where judges congregate. It helps to go to dog
parties. To go to the right shows. To introduce your dog in a purely
social tail-wagging way to influential breeders. To talk frequently about
good breeding. Literary prizes are intractable because editors,
ex-editors, schoolmates, and envious competitors never sit on judging
panels. When a book is called a dog, it makes prize-winning less likely.
The kennel club forbids your family members from judging your dog. Forbids
judges who once sold you a dog. Forbids judges who recently have paid you
to exhibit their own dogs. But it does not forbid ex-spouses, or your
son's judge girl-friend, or judges whose dogs compete with yours, or
judges who you once paid to exhibit your dog, or judges who were once your
kennel-help. It helps to encourage your kennel help and your children's
lovers to become judges. It helps to be a judge yourself and to make a
deal with a judge who would also like his dog to win. It is therefore both
easier and more difficult to win a dog prize than a literary prize.

Alan,
Two things:
1. Are you referring to A.C. Swinburne, the English poet of the late =
19th early 20th century?  I've not read any A.C. S. in decades...is =
there a particular piece you are wondering about or wishing to discuss?  =
Or is it rather you are interested in general impressions of the body of =
the poet's work?  He was prolific, but a bit too metrically sing-songy =
for my personal tastes.  I recall once in a seminar on Modern British =
Poets, during my sophomore year I fell sound asleep during a reading of =
a Swinburne piece by the professor.  I couldn't help myself...the work =
was sooooo long, and its sounds were so regularly syncopated, so =
repetitively like the clicking of the metronome atop the piano they put =
me in a trance.  Damned if I can recall the name of the piece now, =
something with either a French word title, or perhaps a Greek word =
title.  I'll have to search for the piece to see if it is still capable =
of lulling me off to sleep.  Now I think about it, finding the work =
again could result in lowering my wine drinking bills; I won't require =
quite so much libation prior to going to bed.   =20

2. The discussion I was having wasn't about race so much as it was about =
words and the acceptability or not of using specific words, e.g. =
usage...seemed to me to be rather on point for a discussion among folks =
who use words, or at least attempt to use words as part of their =
vocation or avocation. =20

I confess to having smirked and been rather amused by the comments from =
some folks.  Their responses indicated they had their minds made up =
already, knew their positions, and didn't appear too interested in =
participating in the discussion.  I thought that point of view =
acceptable on a site which purports to offer a discussion format.  =
However I also thought that those who, so feeling, felt the need then to =
ridicule others who did not feel that way erred in their dismissive =
comments.=20

What is pompous, one-sided arrogance? Does it show when one assumes =
he/she has the answer and dismisses others who don't already fall in =
line with their thinking?   How dare we have or attempt to have a =
discussion on a topic they found dull, or inappropriate?  or worse, How =
unintelligent we are for having asked questions these folks already knew =
their answers to and didn't really give a damn about hearing what =
someone else had to offer!  Shame on us!

Thanks to some of the responses, I created an acronym: RPP.  (I will =
apply it in private of course, and never post it for fear of being =
guilty of "Flaming.")  But it might amuse you to know some in the world =
might aptly be called RPPers. (Rude Pompous Poets).

But as I say, I would never use the term openly nor level it at any on =
the list.

  I have to back Jesse on this; I found the same conditions in Fukuoka.

  But I'd love to get back to either talking about poetry/poetics and/or
  poetry/poetics presentations here - or a discussion, which might be
  useful, why issues of race etc. come up so often on this list. It's =
not
  endemic; it's not happening on others, but it seems to veer in =
Poetics'
  direction.

  Meanwhile, after some discussions in Normal, I'd really like to know =
what
  people think of Swinburne; I find him disturbing in a way that's =
deeply
  uncomfortable, valuable as a result.

At the sweet and usually notably ripe age of 95, is "Dorothea Tanning" =
still
indeed "emerging",  and as a poet - instead of a painter - no less? I =
love
it. Somebody does have to claim the "Louise Bourgeois" role in poetry,
n'est-ce pas? I tell you, those surrealists are something else! =
Marvelous.

Or is somebody already faking that proud name?

Incidentally, "gaijin" (outside person) can also be used to refer to other
Japanese. To a person from Nagoya, say, who complains about not being able
to relate to the cold and unfriendly people of Tokyo: "well, that's because
you're a gaijin, isn't it". Not that this would be a particularly nice
thing, nor something a gaikokujin would be likely to say.

Interestingly enough, these same issues come up among foreign residents
in Japan who are confronted with "Japanese Only" signs on bath houses,
barber shops, and other public venues, and suffer sexism, racism, and
every other kind of ism in the job market as they attempt to live
productive lives here.  You may keep up with the continuing debate about
this problem by taking a look at the Japan Times on-line version.
We're not talking just about white folks from the U.S. and the U.K.,
but about Chinese, Koreans, Africans, Saudi-Arabians, Iranians,
Iraqis,Brazilians, etc. etc.

Moreover, there are the "hidden holocausts" that happened from
1910--1945 in Korea and for about the same period of time in China,
complete with forced prostitution, enslavement, vivisection, biological
warfare, testing of biological agents on whole villages, attempted
genocide, etc., etc. the extent of which is still being uncovered, and
none of which the Japanese government has begun to apologise for.
There's also the matter of Yasukuni Shrine, which Koizumi insists on
visiting to honor the war dead.  This sounds reasonable enough, until
one sees the place for oneself--then it's obvious that this is a shrine
dedicated to war, and to the Japanese martial spirit, with weapons on
display, etc. etc.  Far from condemning war, the keepers of this shrine
praise it, offering daily prayers to Tojo and the rest.  A bit like the
Germans maintaining a shrine to Hitler.  If you look around you'll see
many of those Old Ones from WWII that Lawrence thinks has passed on to
whatever glory awaits them clapping their hands, bowing their heads,
throwing their coins.  The Japanese have the longest life-expectancy in
the world, and many of those folks are still here fighting the war in
their heads.  I know because I'ive encountered them on the trains and
in the streets and heard from their lips about the "special role in
history" of the Japanese People.  "Nihon #1!"

The Japanese have no qualms about being racist and about throwing around
racist epithets, it's just a fact of life here.  You can see it on
television, hear it on the radio, read it in the textbooks, hear it from
the mouths of the children.  They're not going to change.

That, however, doesn't condone the use of hateful epithets like "Jap"
or like "gaijin," or from the practice of governmentally sanctioned
discrimination based on race, sex, age, etc. Indeed, we, as
non-Japanese, must refrain from doing what the Japanese seem to need to
do to us.  Jesse

For one, there's the poem on the leper. But it's the general tenor of his
work, almost sliding into aural similitude and semantic incoherence, on
the verge of literally sticky sexuality, as if there were a fear of words
that tended to arouse. It's hard to specify. I hardly think him sweet. He
seems murderous, rhyme and assonance as weapons. A different use of
language than I've seen, tour de force of swallowing, emanating. Objects
and their exactitude lose their boundaries, shades of Kristeva's
abjection.

As to 2., I can't answer to that.

Philip, what you just said about calling another Japanese gaijin is
wrong.  Even though you're a great guy and we're on for lunch anytime
this month (and on me!) one Japanese never calls another such a word.
How do I know?  I just did a poll among the women here in my apartment
building and they confirmed it.

Alan, when were you in Fukuoka?  I was in that neck of the woods from
1993--2000.  It would have been great to have met you.  Maybe someday.

Bruna, the term haaafu (half) has been applied again and again to my
kids, as if they were not really Japanese.  In addition, though they're
native speakers of Japanese, strangers will address them in English and
will act amazed that they can speak "their" language!  They've also
started getting the word gaijin thrown at them from other kids.  Yoichi
looks Japanese, so he's pretty much escaped the harshest abuse, but
I'm a little afraid for Tennessee because she has brown hair and more
"foreign" features.  They say that the worst sabetsu (discrimination)
happens in Jr. high school and it can be really awful.  A sad fact: the
children wouldn't engage in this bullying if the parents and in many
cases the teachers (!) didn't encourage it, either directly, or
indirectly by ignoring what is going on in front of them or making
excuses for the actions of the belligerents.  Somehow it is the
"foreigner's" fault that they are discriminated against.  We're not
talking about the right wingers here, Bruna, we are talking about
members of the PTA--average, (usually) nice people who have been taught
that "we Japanese" are somehow different from other mortals.  Both of
my children have Japanese passports and are technically and legally
Japanese.  That does not mean, however, that they will be accepted
socially by other Japanese.  Tokyo, as I believe I said before, is a
different planet.  If you live or have lived in Tokyo you have not--in
my opinion--lived in the real Japan.  Kyoto, Osaka, Fukuoka, Hiroshima,
Nagasaki--that's another matter.  My "haafu" children would find
social acceptance more difficult in cities other than Tokyo.  I don't
know what your experience has been, but I hope that you somehow escaped
all of this.  I hope this for my children as well.

By the way, I don't call my children "halfs" as the Japanese like to
say.  I call them "doubles."

I brought this matter up simply because it appeared that we were
following a good guy/bad guy script with the Japanese. It's a simple
fact that they openly use hate speech with no repercussions and they too
have lots to answer for.  This does not mean that I hate Japan or
dislike the Japanese.  On the contrary, I wouldn't have stayed 13 years
if I didn't make lots of Japanese friends and find daily life here
congenial.  In fact, I am now more comfortable around the Japanese than
I am with people who resemble me.

Yes, I know that a similar situation obtains in Korea, and I have heard
my share of horror stories from "foreigners" who have lived there, but
that still doesn't exonerate the Japanese, or any country that
practices discrimination--including the U.S.  Jesse

Jesse, Steve, I should have been more specific. I didn't mean to suggest
that one Japanese calling another 'gaijin' is at all common--of course, the
word means, primarily and only, for most people, 'foreigner' (short for
'gaikokujin'). But while the other meaning I mentioned is certainly dated,
and only used by some older people, I can assure you that it has been used
in this way. The example I gave you about the person from Nagoya being
called 'gaijin' (just in the sense of his being from a different cultural
background/not sharing the same cultural 'sense'), by a Japanese business
colleague from Tokyo (both around 55-60 years old), is fact. It could never
be used in this way except to a close friend who wouldn't take offense at
being treated lightly/seemingly looked down on in this way. You can find
these other definitions of the word 'gaijin' in Japanese dictionaries, as in
'daisansha' (third party), 'tanin' (unrelated person), 'gaibu no hito'
(outsider/someone outside your circle). In Chinese, this meaning (from the
same written characters) is, I'm told, quite common. But it's not surprising
that the women Jesse spoke to in his apartment building said that they
wouldn't, and couldn't imagine the word being used in this way. (Thanks
Jesse for doing the quick survey!) But as I said in my previous message,
this is just an 'incidental' note, a footnote to Jesse's more important
points.

Subject: Gaijin--For Philip and Alan and Bruna


Philip, what you just said about calling another Japanese gaijin is
wrong.  Even though you're a great guy and we're on for lunch anytime
this month (and on me!) one Japanese never calls another such a word.
How do I know?  I just did a poll among the women here in my apartment
building and they confirmed it.

Alan, when were you in Fukuoka?  I was in that neck of the woods from
1993--2000.  It would have been great to have met you.  Maybe someday.

Bruna, the term haaafu (half) has been applied again and again to my
kids, as if they were not really Japanese.  In addition, though they're
native speakers of Japanese, strangers will address them in English and
will act amazed that they can speak "their" language!  They've also
started getting the word gaijin thrown at them from other kids.  Yoichi
looks Japanese, so he's pretty much escaped the harshest abuse, but
I'm a little afraid for Tennessee because she has brown hair and more
"foreign" features.  They say that the worst sabetsu (discrimination)
happens in Jr. high school and it can be really awful.  A sad fact: the
children wouldn't engage in this bullying if the parents and in many
cases the teachers (!) didn't encourage it, either directly, or
indirectly by ignoring what is going on in front of them or making
excuses for the actions of the belligerents.  Somehow it is the
"foreigner's" fault that they are discriminated against.  We're not
talking about the right wingers here, Bruna, we are talking about
members of the PTA--average, (usually) nice people who have been taught
that "we Japanese" are somehow different from other mortals.  Both of
my children have Japanese passports and are technically and legally
Japanese.  That does not mean, however, that they will be accepted
socially by other Japanese.  Tokyo, as I believe I said before, is a
different planet.  If you live or have lived in Tokyo you have not--in
my opinion--lived in the real Japan.  Kyoto, Osaka, Fukuoka, Hiroshima,
Nagasaki--that's another matter.  My "haafu" children would find
social acceptance more difficult in cities other than Tokyo.  I don't
know what your experience has been, but I hope that you somehow escaped
all of this.  I hope this for my children as well.

Concision is the
> essence of poetry, after all.

I enjoyed Steve Dalachinksi's poem too (especially the
line "mono-po/list's noblemen oracle passwords"), but
I take exception to the idea that concision is the
essence of poetry. It may be the essence of some
poetry, but certainly not all. What about the poetry
of excess, of surplus, of redundancy? Whitman has been
long dismissed for his failure to be concise--and, for
a more contemporary example, Kenny Goldsmith's work
resists the notion of concision entirely.

Bst,
Jsph (fr cncsin)

Alan Sondheim suggested:

But I'd love to get back to either talking about poetry/poetics and/or
poetry/poetics presentations here - or a discussion, which might be
useful, why issues of race etc. come up so often on this list. It's not
endemic; it's not happening on others, but it seems to veer in Poetics'
direction.

***

That's a question I've been wondering about myself -- why do issues of =
race
(and racial terminology, how to talk about race, how to talk about the =
talk
about race, etc.) come up so often on this Poetics list in particular? =
Is it
related to other qualities/preoccupations of this list? In the spirit of =
a
little navel-gazing, let me toss out a few thoughts, with advance =
apologies
for the length:

1. This list is officially dedicated to discussions of poetry and =
poetics.
For many (most?) of us, poetics does not just start/end with poetry and =
text
but extends far into life and the world. So being and thinking in the =
word,
and using language, we naturally get drawn into discussing politics.

2. Politics of world events, as well as the politics of poetry and =
language
in general.

3. This List has never shied away from matters of controversy. Indeed if =
I
remember right, this List was born from an environment of controversy =
itself,
late in the time of the Language Poetry vs. (the then) mainstream
establishment poetry wars.

4. Such was the historical backdrop. But (again, if I remember right), =
this
List was founded by members who were squarely in the
Language/experimental/avant-garde "camp," as a way to continue/expand =
online
the many debates, discussions, and theories that fueled the experimental
scene and gave coherence to the ideas of writers who viewed themselves =
less
as lone practitioners than as participants in a collective community.

5. The collective nature of this community was characterized by:
a. a sense of solidarity, in terms of being collected "in opposition to" =
the
aesthetics of mainstream establishment verse
b. mutual support ("you are like me," "we're in this together," "wanna =
read
in my series?")
c. internal debate & critique-- as practices for pushing oneself and =
others
to think harder, think further, improve articulation, see more sides,
consider shades of meaning, answer challenges, counterpunch, etc.

6. 5c was spirited, internally polemical, often contentious, often
productive. There was a sense (something in the zeitgeist? the backdrop =
of
Bush I and Gulf War I?) that polemical stances within the community were
urgent and necessary-- as a way to continue sparking growth in the =
community,
but also as a practice to ensure that the community stayed true to its =
core
radicalism.

7. Radicalism in aesthetics and aesthetic practice, but also radicalism =
in
politics. The radical role that aesthetics could play in =
relation/dialogue
with politics.

8. Historically (and also autobiographically), I associate the time of =
this
List's beginnings (1993) with a time when post-structuralism, =
postmodernism,
multiculturalism, political correctness, women's studies, and various
ethnic/culture studies departments were developing clout in U.S. =
academic
institutions (a time that makes neocon intellectuals squirm and quote =
Gramsci
with quivering breath).

9. To take up the relevant strand here, political correctness: I =
remember
being a student in the 1990s and watching the double-edged sword of PC
discourse happen live. On the one hand, by establishing some linguistic
guidelines for civil discourse, it opened the door for people to talk =
about
social injustice, personal experiences, previously suppressed =
viewpoints, and
issues of race/ethnicity in a "safe" environment, and much was learned =
in
this way. On the other hand, it had a way of being incredibly touchy and
oversensitive at the time, of making people feel very uncomfortable =
about
expressing their deeper and often more complex views, for fear that =
these
views would be perceived as "incorrect" and thereby ignite the flames of =
an
already inflamed and polemical discourse. At its very worst, PC could =
repress
open discussion, keeping it at the level of "safe," superficial, and at =
times
"fake" parlor room talk.

10. So as much as I appreciate the fruits of the PC wing of =
multiculturalism
(greater sensitivity to viewing/treating different individuals with
egalitarian respect, greater general awareness of the subjectivity of =
"the
other"), I can sympathize with the frustrations. I think many of these
frustrations got silenced in the 80s and 90s and are now, in this =
decade,
finding that the social climate has relaxed to a certain extent and that =
it
might be possible to dig a little deeper into ideas that 10 years would =
have
been way too touchy to explore.

11. Also, the current U.S. role in world politics only invites further
contemplation from thinking people about how to view, talk about, =
understand,
and critique "others."

12. Not that I think this List is the appropriate forum for exploring =
these
issues in depth, but it makes sense to me why the issues are always =
lurking
in the background and sometimes take over center stage, with respect to
language usage and the times we live in (Bush II, Gulf War II) today.

13. To get back to poetics, it has felt to me that the polemicized =
nature of
this List (like the polemicized nature of PC discourse) has gotten
considerably relaxed as of late. I mean the polemics about poetics and =
poetry
itself (see 5 and 6). Well we all know about this. The battlelines have =
been
drawn and redrawn and redrawn again, and the fight is no longer fresh.
Rather, now seems to be a time of rapprochement in various forms-- more =
poets
from the experimental tradition landing academic posts, their subsequent
influence & power upon MFA programs, Fence Magazine, the January almanac =
on
the Academy of American Poets website, Lyn Hejinian editing the Best =
American
series. For better or for worse, there is more crossover between the two
"camps," more proliferation of "experimental" writings (how many =
bloggers
have bemoaned the surplus of young poets coming out of =
experimental-minded
MFA programs and reentering the institutional bloodstream as =
instructors?),
less and less of a clear line between the establishment and the previous
anti-establishmentarians. Ron Silliman explores this in his February 22
"prophecy": http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/

14. So in a way I think we are living in a time of release, a time of
aftermath. Even as we are living in a time of intense battle, violent
conflicts abroad, major and too-significant domestic policy battles at =
home
in the U.S. And if there is not currently a polemicized situation within =
the
poetics community itself, which fires the passions and gets people =
posting to
the list, then there are certainly plenty such situations in the world =
to get
us going, in the polemical spirit of Poetics.

Please come! A bona fide Unpleasant Event Schedule
reading this Saturday!


Saturday, February 26, 2:30pm


An Unpleasant Event Schedule reading.  As part of the
Frequency Reading Series, three UES contributors will
read their work:   Leonard Gontarek (from
Philadelphia), Amy King (from Brooklyn), and Tracey
Knapp (from Boston).


Location:


Four-Faced Liar
165 West 4th Street (at 6th Avenue)
New York, NY

http://unpleasanteventschedule.com/



AND on Sunday from TYPO Magazine:


Dear friends, readers, writers, and all who yearn for
the burning chair,

We offer the second installment of the Burning Chair
Readings, featuring Sabrina Orah Mark and Marie
Mutsuki Mockett, set for Sunday, February 27th,
sharply at 8PM.  Due to renovations at the Cloister
Café, the gathering will take place two doors down at
**Solas, 232 East 9th Street, between 2nd and 3rd
Avenues.**

Sabrina and Marie write, each in her own way, outside
of the usual literary frameworks.  Each writes
innovatively, accessibly, and beyond prescribed
conventions.  Sabrina’s poems figure their way through
the dark contraptions of the world.  It’s her voice
versus the inventions of the monsters—time, space, and
the terrible endeavors of humanity.  Marie’s fiction
winds through the despairing and laughing shapes of
the world, observing and calculating toward a
discovery that remains unrealized beyond those forms.
Each has found an ageless voice and will lead us, as
audience, into the unlit stretches.

Please, join us for the reading and post-reading
celebration.

Warmly,

Danielle, Dave, Greg, Katy, and Matt

Great!
Will there be a transcript/webcast of the discussion?
http://www.georgetown.edu/departments/english/lannan

the thing is how do you get people still engulfed in book culture, who =
see
print publications as the currency of literature, to acknowledge there =
is
even anything happening in the field of digital poetics and poetries?

People like Katherine Hayles have been trying for years.

If we keep framing that experience in terms of pre-digital literary =
theories
then the possibilities of digital poetries are also predictable, fully
realised by previous actualisations. The virtuality of poetry, in
philosophical terms, as a problematic, a multiplicity of questions,
attempted answers and more questions to the attempted solutions, as an =
ideas
domain rather than physical archive, needs to take into account the new
actualisations realised as digital media poetries. Otherwise the ideas
domain of poetry is incomplete.

Today even if speaking about print published poetry the argument is =
replete
without consideration of the influence of digital technologies on the
poetics of poetry and poetic culture.

Deaccessioned Landscapes, by Jonathan Brannen
112 pages, poetry

ISBN 0-925904-34-1
$16

Huge Haiku, by David McAleavey
340 pages, poetry

ISBN 0-925904-46-5
$20

On Deaccessioned Landscapes:

"The word [deaccessioned] you've entered does not appear in the
dictionary," my search engine informs me, although it does let me know
that "accession" involves increase, acquisition. To which Jonathan Brannen,
in this book of linked meditations, responds, "Minus is more
exact / than plus." Or, "there are no / empty words," which fact proves
over and again in his explorations of distance, passage, and death's
imprint on identity. By writing his poems along two tracks, one that
gathers thinking together, and another that disperses it, Brannen
illustrates the tenuousness of language even as he shows faith in the act
of speech. I have not for some time read such a profound consideration of
"what passes," or how best to talk about the mind's landscapes once they're
gone.
--Susan M. Schultz

The visceral and the intellectual, the fragmentary and the full, the future
and memory - Jonathan Brannen interrogates opposites in these facing pairs,
brilliantly illuminating the zone of language that operates between. Sharp
and bright, it's a collection that sees the world in all its detail and in
vivid color; it sparks the mind.
-- Cole Swensen


On Huge Haiku:
Huge Haiku indeed. Incredibly obsessive, exceptionally detailed haiku might
be a more exact description. Imagine 80 Flowers exfoliating over a far
greater terrain, growing wild in fact with a sense of its own range. Yet
not without self-knowledge. "Blunt architecture" is both the first title
and first phrase of the opening poem, a figure that might capture the
project itself at hand, recount something as simple as a deck addition
to a home & reverberate not-so-coincidentally with the profession of the
poet's father.

These poems to my ear are at their best at their most dense - I think I
would say this of almost any poet - and yet, not unlike Bob
Perelman, McAleavey often refuses that final step off the springboard into
the level of opacity we associate, say, with something like
80 Flowers out of an ethical commitment both to content & reader. This
sometimes gives the haiku a thematic center that puts individual pieces
again midway betwixt Oppen & (of all things) Berryman's Dream Songs, the
poetry McAleavey was most enthusiastic about when first I met him. This
may, in fact, be the first work influenced by Berryman that I can think of
that takes that formal impulse forward, precisely because it recognizes
these disparate connections. There is a world in which Berryman & Zukofsky
make perfect sense together - and this pretty much is it.
-- Ron Silliman


Part hayride, part toboggan run, Huge Haiku offers poems that get you from
here to there and there to here in a meandering hurry. They stop time and
troubadour flash dazzle while underneath a deeper wisdom lays down tracks.
Read it.
-- Eli Goldblatt


The poems here feature the best kind of innovation, that which retains the
old in the new but also gives readers what they have never seen
before. David McAleavey expands the form of the haiku into something alive
and incisively of our time. Through the mathematical rigor of
their stanzas and lines, the poems in Huge Haiku open themselves out to an
astonishing variety of experiences and disruptive contrasts. Whether the
subject is the natural world, the suburbs or the city, growing up or
growing older, politics or language or absurdity, these poems never settle
for easy answers, but pull us repeatedly back into a world that's both
dangerous and full of possibility. In so doing, McAleveay takes the great
virtue of haiku-its exactness of detail-and focuses it resolutely on our
own contemporary and wildly layered strangeness.
-- Mark Wallace

-- Caroline Bergvall: Fiona Templeton's Cells of Release

     For six weeks, in 1995, the poet and performer Fiona Templeton locked
herself up in the lugubrious corridors of the abandoned Eastern Penitentiary
of Philadelphia to write. Why would she do this? Why would one do this? But
this she did, "over six weeks", writing by hand with an indelible marker, no
return no edit, "I wrote without the possibility of erasure", on one long
string of paper, "where a spool of paper ran out, I sewed on the next one",
guiding it through one prison cell per day, and for as long as it would take
to work through the thirty-eight cells that make up this one corridor of the
dreadful panopticon.

Hi Pam---
Thank you for your analysis. It's very much appreciated.
I think the history of the list and the history of the various
rapproachments you mention
definitely have some parallels, or overlaps, but there's also some other
other factors
that might be involved in which these two histories may somewhat differ.
For, yes, I remember witnessing and participating in
very distinct, and, yes, comparitively "unrelaxed" (more theoretically based
and sustained) discussions on this list circa 94-96, and have seen a gradual
relaxation since that time
(with some occasional bursts, but, as you argue, more often than not
occasioned by socio-political issues, 9/11, the recent presidential
election, etc, than by issues of "poetics" as such).
While part of this can be attributed to the gradual dropping out from active
participation of many with already articulated positions, many of the lang.
poets either setting the terms of the discussion or at least using the forum
to continue certain debates with others of their generation or older (when
Creeley, Don Byrd, and Perloff were more active). The list was certainly
more "closed" then, even if this was just because of the mere fact that word
of it hadn't gotten around (rather than a blatant attempt to have a more
closed discussion), for it was certainly open to others who certainly did
not share many of the core assumptions of the Lang. Po. polemicists. In
fact, one of the exciting things about this list in those early years was
that it created a forum for myself and some other young writers to begin to
articulate, in a somewhat informal way, our poetics and polemics in ways
that other more formal forums didn't allow. After awhile many of the
"established names" and many of the younger polemicists (say Steve Evans,
Mark Wallace, Louis Cabri) interested in a specific debate which either
extended, challenged, or reacted to a Lang Po. poetics took their debates
elsewhere (the blogosphere, for instance; their dissertations; various
"sub-lists"). In addition, certain "flame wars" drove some people away, and
the list opened up to many for whom the issue of "poetics"
as understood by this list's "founding fathers" (yes, mostly male---more on
gender in a second) was
often a more marginal concern. In my off-on involvement during these last 7
or 8 years (I've dropped out on a few occasions for a year at a time or so),
I'm definitely aware that I became less interested
in articulating my poetics on this forum (since, like many others, I
discovered that when I attempted to work out a more subtle response to
someone's post, it would more likely be ignored than if I just
wrote a short, relatively unreflective quip), and would tend to seek out
other forums for a more serious discussion, or start backchannel
conversations, etc., or "lurk." I'm not necessarily lamenting this change;
obviously I'm still here (while many of my old friends and colleagues are
not, except to advertise their new book or workshop)--but I do think this
history cannot be exactly explained
by the other history (of RAPPROACHMENT) you mention.

The history of that rapproachment also fascinates me, probably more than the
specific history of this list--for, to me at least, it seems to have more
consequence. My particular take on it differs from both those who still
claim the "utopian" vision of Lang Po as somehow separate from "official
verse culture" (and yes some still make that argument) on one hand, and
those who consider the collapsing of those boundaries (from the 80s "poetry
wars"), to be a positive thing (the influence over MFA programs, the
championing of the "fragment" by many at IOWA, etc.). Since I've been
articulating that elsewhere (in an interview with Bengali writer Aryanil
Mukherjee and in Fulcrum Magazine, for instance), I won't get into the
intricacies of my particular polemical stance here,
but I will say, briefly, that there is a valid perspective from which this
"rapproachment" (or even "merger") of some aspects of the lang. po
aesthetics with some aspects of what used to be called "mainstream"
aesthetics has helped reinstate a "HIGH" VS "LOW" dichotomy (which to some
extent was implicit in some of the lang. pos polemics, though framed as
"LEFT" VS "RIGHT") which has in effect created a new "official verse
culture" which in some ways is very closed (not at all that different from
that passage by PAUL CARROLL which PERLOFF quotes in the beginning of her
book on FRANK O'HARA, and, one could hope, very ripe for something to happen
like the opening that happened with that coalition of poets Donald Allen was
able to assemble in his anthology emerged).
Of course, for something like that to happen, there may need to be other
factors, outside of the realm of "poetry" and "poetics...." (and some of
these factors may involve the issue, Pam, from which you began this
discussion, like the social move toward integration that was happening in
the 1950s, which, to many of course, doesn't seem as BAD now---like the
PRIVITIZATION OF SCHOOLS issue isn't as BLATANTLY a Segregation issue as
BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION, but it really is if you think about it....

Anyway, so that's one theory why there seem to be less POLEMICS in the field
of POETICS (beyond the list) these days than there were in the 80s and early
90s. But there are others too, and perhaps GENDER comes into play here. One
conversation I've been involved in REPEATEDLY since say 1996 with many well
known poets goes something like this: "OKAY, Duncan WAS Pretentious in his
Polemics, and Watten, for instance, is to be applauded, for challenging
those polemics. But in a way, even if he helped challenge the mystical
magical poet ON HIGH notion, he too replicated what's so
abhorrent about those polemics, and WE, by contrast, can now take a middle
ground, or avoid the excesses of polemics altogether." Now the fact that
many of the people who've said things like this to me happen to be female
may be entirely accidental (I certainly don't want to make a gendered
essentialist argument here), but if you couple this with the fact that many
of the most celebrated writers of "my generation" so far are women, one may
come to understand why many of the males
have come to think that engaging in polemics is a form of "male chest
beating" rather than a useful tool for organizing one's thoughts, etc. It
will be interesting to see how this plays out. I myself am rather torn about
it--on one level I celebrate the changes that have happened in terms of a
more gendered discussion in recent years, and I certainly don't mean to say
that you, Pam, share these thoughts about the gendering of polemics I
characterized above, but I also wonder if that position I characterized
above (whether spoken by a female or a male) has, instead of creating a new
openness to various poetic modes has rather merely replaced the role of
polemics and criticism with a
backroom dealing in which people lack the courage to articulate a poetics of
resistance that doesn't simply rehash the old language line (or an old
duncan line for that matter) on the grounds that
it might be considered a kind of "chest beating" that in the current climate
is considered anti-social.

Okay, I left a lot of loose ends here, but I thought I'd throw some of this
out, because when I read your post Pam I am reminded why I got on this list
in the first place, and thought I'd at least try to
raise some of my concerns here, in hopes of furthering discussion, either on
this list, backchannel, or by any means necessary....

Dear friends, readers, writers, and all who yearn for the burning chair,


We offer the second installment of the Burning Chair Readings, featuring Sa=
brina
Orah Mark and Marie Mutsuki Mockett, set for Sunday, February 27th, sharply=
 at
8PM.  Due to renovations at the Cloister Caf=C3=A9, the gathering will take=
 place
two doors down at Solas, 232 East 9th Street, between 2nd and 3rd Avenues.

Sabrina and Marie write, each in her own way, outside of the usual literary
frameworks.  Each writes innovatively, accessibly, and beyond prescribed
conventions.  Sabrina's poems figure their way through the dark contraption=
s of
the world.  It's her voice versus the inventions of the monsters=E2=80=94ti=
me, space,
and the terrible endeavors of humanity.  Marie's fiction winds through the
despairing and laughing shapes of the world, observing and calculating towa=
rd a
discovery that remains unrealized beyond those forms.  Each has found an ag=
eless
voice and will lead us, as audience, into the unlit stretches.

Please, join us for the reading and post-reading celebration.

Warmly,
Adam Clay

Death & Memory of Cock Robin


'Who kill'd Cock Robin?
  I, said the Sparrow,
With my bow and arrow,
  I kill'd Cock Robin.

Who saw him die?
  I, said the Fly,
With my little eye,
  I saw him die.'

Who saw him fall?
  I, said the Rule,
With hammer and with awl,
  I saw him fall.

Who saw him flayed?
  I, said the Moon,
As I danced and played,
  I saw him flayed.

Who heard his screams?
  I, said the Mind,
In my darkest dreams,
  I heard his screams.

Who turned away?
  I, said the Sun,
I was busy with the day,
  I turned away.

Who mourned and cried?
  I, said the Lark,
Someone else has died,
  I mourned and cried.

Who has time to mourn?
  I, said the Worm,
There's nothing left to harm,
  I have time to mourn.

Who bears the grave?
  I, said the Auk,
There's still a soul to save,
  I bear the grave.

Who prays for years?
  I, said Cock Robin,
For nameless are my fears,
  I'll pray for years.

The Roll of the Letter

All letters are good for spelling words, but did you know that some letters
are good for rolling?  Of course you did!

In anticipation of the Lannan Poetry Series mini-conference "Digital
Poetics: A Cultural Response," on March 3, the Lannan Poetry Series is
hosting "The Roll of the Letter," an interactive outdoor performance
combining projected animated text with large three-dimensional "rollable"
letters. =20

Come watch performers roll, spin, bend and twist assorted four-foot-high
O=B9s, G=B9s, D=B9s, C=B9s and e=B9s in choreographed sequences.  Maybe give a letter
a spin yourself!

Don=B9t miss "The Roll of the Letter" on Tuesday, March 1 in Georgetown's Red
Square @ 6 p.m. =20

Projected digitally animated poetry by Ambroise Barras, Giselle Beiguelman

The Strange Case
of the Internal Dialogue
=20
=20
On a number of city blocks near my place of work were posted, overnight it =
seemed, a vast array of stickers with cartoon interpretations of famous pol=
iticians. Just above the cartoon heads were large speech bubbles of the var=
iety in which a hooked or crescent appendage thrust casually from its lower=
 half =96 unlike those in which smaller and smaller bubbles issued from the=
 larger bubble, falling lightly toward the two dimensional speaker, as if t=
o eventually alight and pop on the speaker=92s forehead. In an instant one =
particular sticker was surrounded by people who were on their way to work. =
Each, individually, and in their own time, came to a fit of laughing after =
moments of serious study. As I approached I casually awaited a space where =
I could see and read the caption so that I too may have a hearty laugh at t=
he expense of a famous politician. After a few moments I checked my watch a=
nd realized I would be late for work if I remained to see the caption on th=
e sticker =96 but I was rather curious to see it myself, hoping to have an =
object of humor to share with my colleagues when I entered the office. But =
the crowd in front of me grew larger and larger, the laughing became uproar=
ious and hostile, and the curiosity burned in my head so that I pushed my w=
ay through to the telephone pole where the sticker had been placed. I climb=
ed over one shoulder, then another, hoping to see the message on the sticke=
r. =93What does it say? What does it say=94 I shouted to the crowd. =93For =
heaven=92s sake what does it say?=94 =93Nothing,=94 cried a voice at the he=
ad of the crowd, =93you=92ll have to see for yourself!=94






The Incident=20
in the Living Room=20
of a Famous Dentist


In the living room of a famous dentist was a metal box with a keyhole in th=
e front. After a few drinks the famous dentist pulled a key ring from his p=
ocket which contained many keys and tried =96 to no avail =96 each and ever=
y one. =93There=92s nothing inside,=94 I said, =93I assure you.=94 When the=
 last key failed to enter the keyhole another large ring of keys was summon=
ed for by the dentist. At last, and quite expectedly, not one key on the se=
cond ring could be fit into the keyhole. =93Honestly,=94 I begged, =93I=92m=
 quite positive there is nothing inside.=94 A third set of keys was brought=
 to the famous dentist but he ordered the servant to be dismissed, pulling =
from his pocket a large pen knife which he jammed into the keyhole. After a=
 few moments his face had gone from composed to contorted. =93Please, Docto=
r, it=92s really quite alright=94 I said as the latch broke and the lid pop=
ped open with a thump. He looked inside and saw the servant sitting in the =
middle of the box with his legs crossed. =93What are you doing in there,=94=
 ordered the famous dentist. The servant looked up, and with total composur=
e answered, =93Why, nothing.=94

i am a way too wordy poet myself  there i've said it POET  uch

but what i was getting at with the abc poem whose form actually has a

i've now forgotten
is
if rules are followed the basic rules for this poem
are a-z  words  period  nothing added no sermons
each letter represents one word
that's the challenge and why so many pomes of this sort
end up  so quirky

Apologies for cross posting.

I'm conscious in sending information out about our publishing that people
will be receiving posts from us a number of times (personally, from email
subscription with us, and through membership of listservs); this is bound to
be annoying and confusing.

I've got around 20 books coming out in the next few months and 65 scheduled
for this year, and email alerts are an important service for our customers
and it's one we want to improve and develop in the future.

Having thought about this, I think the best way for me to announce new books
is *exclusively* from my own email alerting service, so from now on I'll
only be posting publishing news to subscribers of those services. I'll
periodically post notice that people can join that (given new members do
join listservs), but if you wish to receive information on new titles from
Salt, you can join (or leave) our email alerting services at this address:

http://www.saltpublishing.com/mailinglist.htm

There are currently two services, Salt New Title Announcements, and bookshop
news at SPB (the Salt Publishing Bookstore), you can join one or both, as
you wish. If you think others may be interested in our email alerts, do
please let them know.

Many thanks.

Best wishes
Chris

Fear no longer, happy people, there is finally a new issue up at
www.UnlikelyStories.org!

Before I ramble about the rest of the issue, I'd like to draw your
attention to the latest episode of A Sardine on Vacation. Many moons
ago, when Unlikely Stories was tired and Unlikely 2.0 was not yet an
itch in its daddy's pants, a man calling himself the Sardine suggested
running a weekly column, for one year, of the adventures of A Sardine on
Vacation, in 52 parts. I told him I didn't want to increase my
publishing schedule to weekly, but I had run Unlikely Stories for years
and saw no reason we couldn't do 52 episodes monthly. Many of you know
that my publication schedule was interrupted, and a new site has been
formed, but A Sardine on Vacation continued. We've now published 24
episodes, two year's worth, of A Sardine on Vacation; nine episodes on
Unlikely 2.0 and fifteen lurking around on the old site. I'm looking
forward to publishing 36 more.

In addition to the 24th episode of A Sardine on Vacation, this issue
presents:

An interview with political author Joe Bageant
Rania Zada on the New Age and spiritualism
"Right Wing Media and the Propaganda of Facists" by Mavi Gözler
"Serial Killers as a Cultural Construct" by Sam Vaknin
short fiction by AD Winans, Rob Rosen, Terry P. Rizzuti, Korinna Irwin,
and Kurtice Kucheman, formerly known as Kurt Lee
poetry by Shane Allison, Steve Dalachinsky, Donna Kuhn, Jonathan Hayes,
John Bryan, C. Derick Varn, Dana Jerman, M. Andre Vancrown and NeBa

Our normal publication schedule will resume in mid-March, with a
multimedia issue. Now go read something.

captives, Virginia, insisted the orator
you retrieved to bind charm to the dawn,
take turns being the ocean's face -- we captives
surfaced quickly and there's hardly water this time


paddling around the bookshelves,
we were never the anchors,
only telescopes to shape the stars
and found skies frequent speech more
than speech frequents skies


your shores, Virginia, we wear -
our waters, once boundless as the hum of bees,
tho, Virginia, you've sealed dark, dark
here, where there's no sun, are all lyrics punished
and all looks are dedicated to beasts - O heavy,
heavy weighs their splendor, their petals are
ENIGMA when in full bloom, but as the days fly over
the moon, these beasts wither in character,
honeyed solid at last

The Complete Tribune Primer

Eugene Field, 1901

Selections (probably written 1881-83):


THE MOTHERLESS INFANT

The Man has a Baby. The Baby is Three weeks
Old. Its Mamma Died two Years ago. Poor
little Baby! Do you not Feel Sorry for It?

THE MUD

The Mud is in the Street. The Lady has on a
pair of Red Stockings. She is Trying to Cross
the Street. Let us all give Three cheers for the
Mud.

THE GUN

This is a gun. Is the Gun loaded? Really, I do
not know. Let us Find out. Put the Gun on
the table, and you, Susie, blow down one barrel,
while you, Charlie, blow down the other. Bang!
Yes, it was loaded. Run quick, Jennie, and pick up
Susie's head and Charlie's lower Jaw before the
Nasty Blood gets over the New carpet.

THE COAL-HOD

Oh, how nice and Black the Coal-Hod is! Run,
children, Run quick and put your Little Fat
hands in it. Mercy me, your Hands are as Black as
the Coal-Hod now! Hark! Mamma is Coming.
She will spank you when she Finds your Hands so
Dirty. Better go and Rub the Black Dirt off on
the Wall Paper before she Comes.

THE NAUGHTY RAT

The Rat is Gnawing at the Baby's Ear. The
Baby is in the cradle, and is so Little it cannot
Help itself. Oh, how Piteously it is Crying! The
Rat does not care a Cent, and keeps Eating away at
the Baby's Ear. When it gets this Ear eaten off it
will Crawl over the Baby's neck and eat the other
Ear. Where is the Baby's Mamma? She is Down
in the Back Yard Talking over the fence to the
neighbors about her New Dress. You must Tell
your Mamma never to Leave you Alone in the
Cradle, or a Rat may Eat off your Poor little Ears.

SLEEPY KITTY

The Cat is Asleep on the Rug. Step on her Tail
and See if she will Wake up. Oh, no; She will
not wake. She is a heavy Sleeper. Perhaps if you
Were to saw her Tail off with the Carving knife
you might Attract hr attention. Suppose you try.

THE AWFUL BUGABOO

Oh, what a Bad Mamma to Leave Little Esther
allAlone in the Dark Room. No wonder Es-
ther is Crying. She is afraid a Big Bugaboo will
come down the Chimney and Eat her up. Bugaboos
like to Eat little Children. Did you ever see a Buga-
boo with its Big Fire Eyes and Cold Teeth all over
Blood? The next Time Mamma leaves you Alone
in a Dark room, perhaps One will Come to Eat you.

THE DEEP WELL

The Well is very Dark and Deep. There is Nice
Cool Water in the Well. If you Lean way Over
the Side, maybe you will Fall in the Well and down
in the Dear Water. We will Give you some Candy
if you will Try. There is a Sweet Little Birdie in
the bottom of the Well. Your Mamma would be
Surprised to find you in the Well, would she not?

THE WASP

See the Wasp. He has pretty yellow Stripes
around his Body, and a Darning Needle in his
Tail. If you Will Pat the Wasp upon the Tail, we
will Give You a Nice Picture Book.

THE HIRED GIRL

This is an Hired girl. She has Something in
her Hand. It is a Can, and there is Coal Oil
inside. The Hired Girl is going to Light a Fire in
the Kitchen Stove. She has been Disappointed in
Love, and Desires to Die. She will Put some of the
Pil in the Stove, and Light it with a Match. In
about half a Minute she will be Twanging a Gold
Harp among the Elect in Heaven.

THE POET

Who is this Creature with Long Hair and a
Wild Eye? He is a poet. He writes Poems
on Spring and Women's Eyes and Strange, unreal
Things of that Kind. He is always Wishing he
was Dead, but he wouldn't Let anybody Kill him if
he could Get away. A mighty good Sausage
Stuffer was Spoiled when the Man became a Poet.
He would Look well Standing under a Descending
Pile Driver.

THE SEWING MACHINE

Here is a Sewing Machine. It was Made for
little Children to Play with. Put your Feet on
the Treadle and Make the Wheels go round Fast.
See how the Thread unwinds and the Needle bobs
up and down! This is Lots of Fun. Do not Deny
baby the privilege of Putting his Fat little Finger
under the Needle. It will Make pretty holes in the
Finger and give Baby something to occupy his At-
tention for a Long time.

AN EPITAPH

Here lies the body of Mary Ann,
  Who rests in the bosom of Abraham.
It's all very nice for Mary Ann,
  But it's mighty tough on Abraham.

Her brother hated my ass told me I couldn't equal the toilet paper balls =
that collected in the hairs in her butt crack and ordered me away for =
good only she didn't agree with his assessment to condemn my soul and =
maybe she was also horny so we fucked and brought new people into the =
world to worry about what the fuck they'd be worth when they grew up but =
we didn't have to care about that because fuck it that would be their =
problem and her brother wouldn't be there to lend any of his advice so =
we thought maybe everything would work out for them better than for us =
in this dingy apartment me working that Midas Muffler job she on the =
check-out line at the Wal-Mart part time because more hours meant they =
had to pay overtime and benefits and give vacations but we got by and =
saved some money each friday thinking maybe someday we could afford a =
little house and after enough time we could maybe find us a small =
business to buy like maybe one of those little coffee huts that tourists =
swarm to and we could make a comfortable living like capitalists across =
the land of the FREE that never happened of course because the kids =
needed shit all the time like books and clothes and food and stuff and =
when they got to be teenagers they needed WANT which of course we =
couldn't afford like CDs then DVDs then IPODs and a whole world of WANT =
that didn't really have any resemblance to NEED but drove a wedge =
between us so I just said fuck it and went away leaving her to collect =
government checks that came to more than I got paid so she could buy =
more WANTS and make the kids happier while I found her brother in =
Alabama and he gave me a job off the books so I could send money to her =
without the government knowing and reducing her checks life's not any =
better now I mean I have no children at home and my love is about three =
hundred miles away and the WANTS run things for everybody including me =
and her brother and I keep thinking maybe after the kids are gone she'll =
come back and she and I and her brother can share an apartment somewhere =
near Birmingham or maybe Montgomery hell even Mobile if that's a better =
place to settle and her brother still thinks I don't amount to one god =
damned butt ball and I'm thinking maybe the fucker is clairvoyant.

Amazing business, craziness daily!
Enormously funny gatherings happen
in Jane’s Kaleidoscope Lounge.

Many nights old philosophers
quack rhetorical speeches
talking Utopian visionaries,
wizards, Xanadu,
youthful zaniness.


Beatnik characters
deliver emanicipation folios.
Green hippies introduce juice kicks
like marvelous Nigerian orange
pineapple quinine rhizome soup.
Tastes unnervingly velvety.
Wildly x-otic! Yummy ztuff.

Art Blakey, Coltrane, Duke,
Ella Fitzgerald get heard

Music’s never over,
piano quiets, radio starts;
trumpets, uproarious violins,
woodwinds, xylophones,
yodeling, zydeco.


Jazz keeps loosening moods.
Nefarious ogres pass quiet relaxed siestas
tamely undergoing  velvety woodwind xperiments
zippily arranged by Carter Denizen,
everyone’s favorite gay hermaphrodite inventor.

and buy cocaine.


Dates’re easily found.
Groping’s heaven
in Jane’s Kaleidoscope Lounge.

Midnight: naked orgy people;
queer realtors, sneaky teachers
under various warrants
xploit young, zonked
androgynous boy cheerleaders.


Zoophilic, yicky, x-rated weirdness!
Vaseliney undulations,
titilating, swivel-hipped razzle-dazzle

into historionic grooves
for each-to-other dance,
coital bonding adventures.

*   *   *

Among barbarous comrades

Crazy derelicts eat free greasy ham
in Juke’s Kitchen late Monday nights.

>(with some occasional bursts, but, as you argue, more often than not

>that other more formal forums didn't allow. After awhile many of the
>"established names" and many of the younger polemicists (say Steve Evans,
>Mark Wallace, Louis Cabri) interested in a specific debate which either
>extended, challenged, or reacted to a Lang Po. poetics took their debates
>elsewhere (the blogosphere, for instance; their dissertations; various
>"sub-lists"). In addition, certain "flame wars" drove some people away, and
>the list opened up to many for whom the issue of "poetics"
>as understood by this list's "founding fathers" (yes, mostly male---more on
>gender in a second) was
>often a more marginal concern. In my off-on involvement during these last 7
>or 8 years (I've dropped out on a few occasions for a year at a time or
>so),
>I'm definitely aware that I became less interested
>in articulating my poetics on this forum (since, like many others, I
>discovered that when I attempted to work out a more subtle response to
>someone's post, it would more likely be ignored than if I just
>wrote a short, relatively unreflective quip), and would tend to seek out
>other forums for a more serious discussion, or start backchannel

>obviously I'm still here (while many of my old friends and colleagues are
>not, except to advertise their new book or workshop)--but I do think this
>history cannot be exactly explained
>by the other history (of RAPPROACHMENT) you mention.
>
>The history of that rapproachment also fascinates me, probably more than
>the

>consequence. My particular take on it differs from both those who still
>claim the "utopian" vision of Lang Po as somehow separate from "official
>verse culture" (and yes some still make that argument) on one hand, and
>those who consider the collapsing of those boundaries (from the 80s "poetry
>wars"), to be a positive thing (the influence over MFA programs, the
>championing of the "fragment" by many at IOWA, etc.). Since I've been
>articulating that elsewhere (in an interview with Bengali writer Aryanil
>Mukherjee and in Fulcrum Magazine, for instance), I won't get into the
>intricacies of my particular polemical stance here,
>but I will say, briefly, that there is a valid perspective from which this
>"rapproachment" (or even "merger") of some aspects of the lang. po
>aesthetics with some aspects of what used to be called "mainstream"
>aesthetics has helped reinstate a "HIGH" VS "LOW" dichotomy (which to some
>extent was implicit in some of the lang. pos polemics, though framed as
>"LEFT" VS "RIGHT") which has in effect created a new "official verse
>culture" which in some ways is very closed (not at all that different from
>that passage by PAUL CARROLL which PERLOFF quotes in the beginning of her
>book on FRANK O'HARA, and, one could hope, very ripe for something to
>happen
>like the opening that happened with that coalition of poets Donald Allen
>was
>able to assemble in his anthology emerged).
>Of course, for something like that to happen, there may need to be other
>factors, outside of the realm of "poetry" and "poetics...." (and some of
>these factors may involve the issue, Pam, from which you began this
>discussion, like the social move toward integration that was happening in
>the 1950s, which, to many of course, doesn't seem as BAD now---like the
>PRIVITIZATION OF SCHOOLS issue isn't as BLATANTLY a Segregation issue as
>BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION, but it really is if you think about it....
>
>Anyway, so that's one theory why there seem to be less POLEMICS in the
>field
>of POETICS (beyond the list) these days than there were in the 80s and
>early
>90s. But there are others too, and perhaps GENDER comes into play here. One
>conversation I've been involved in REPEATEDLY since say 1996 with many well
>known poets goes something like this: "OKAY, Duncan WAS Pretentious in his
>Polemics, and Watten, for instance, is to be applauded, for challenging
>those polemics. But in a way, even if he helped challenge the mystical
>magical poet ON HIGH notion, he too replicated what's so
>abhorrent about those polemics, and WE, by contrast, can now take a middle
>ground, or avoid the excesses of polemics altogether." Now the fact that
>many of the people who've said things like this to me happen to be female
>may be entirely accidental (I certainly don't want to make a gendered
>essentialist argument here), but if you couple this with the fact that many
>of the most celebrated writers of "my generation" so far are women, one may
>come to understand why many of the males
>have come to think that engaging in polemics is a form of "male chest
>beating" rather than a useful tool for organizing one's thoughts, etc. It
>will be interesting to see how this plays out. I myself am rather torn
>about
>it--on one level I celebrate the changes that have happened in terms of a
>more gendered discussion in recent years, and I certainly don't mean to say
>that you, Pam, share these thoughts about the gendering of polemics I
>characterized above, but I also wonder if that position I characterized
>above (whether spoken by a female or a male) has, instead of creating a new
>openness to various poetic modes has rather merely replaced the role of
>polemics and criticism with a
>backroom dealing in which people lack the courage to articulate a poetics
>of
>resistance that doesn't simply rehash the old language line (or an old
>duncan line for that matter) on the grounds that

>
>Okay, I left a lot of loose ends here, but I thought I'd throw some of this

MIME-Version: 1.0

as if this were a performance

CATALYST >> which it is not. it is
a cyclone of performance, you have it all, there are
no images, no sound coming through, no interactive,
no audience.
nothing but the typing as if there were,
as if i were somewhere else. look, for example, out of that
window, there is nothing, but perhaps would be, at anothertime. inside my
mind i woke up this morning, terrified,
of starvation, this drives me, thinking about Sam Harri's book on
religion and rationality and terror as well, it is brilliant, but perhaps
not as brilliant as that man walkin on the roof of the church
or was it a factory, visible
from the back window here where we live, then figured
perhaps if i kill myself azure will survive, better,
then how selfish that would be, she would inherit what i have,
but then i wouldn't be around in my moody neurotic self
which is stressed to encompass death, i think, at every moment, or am
hypochondriac, perhaps that is spelled wrong, i am reason a novel by
the partner of my daughter and it is brilliant, but what can i do
in the world
nothing, i will aNSWER   that, of no audience here, money is everything,
we would use momney against them and keep just enough for ourselves,
welived on azure's students loans last semester, just that, and soe small
extras but small, i think perhaps thirteen thousand altogether, we have
to pay back, the cost of this place, my life, is less than a cannon
or a car, less than a vacatoin or a spa,
more than a country or a village, but we have our ecological footprint
reduced as much as possible, it is recyling all the way except for
equipment which strangles me, yesterday found a book for two dollars
in german on the current state of scientific research into elctricity
at that point which was 1781, there it was waiting for me, now
there is money all around me, if i could only take it
i'd heal myself heal the world, another book, a dictionary from 1848
french into english and english into french, many words i have not known
in either language, i am working through the archives of the world
i will reach the end
i will die at that point and all the archives will die with me
and wittgenstein
azure will continue and my relatives will continue and my friends
there are some friends who are already no longer continuing
i should consider muyself lucky
the radio is on there are no problems to encounter in new jersey
heavy traffic on the westside highway those people
have cars and other vehicles, they couldn't be there
if they didn't so i read parts of orwell's
down and out in london and paris and got stuck on the image of the jew
just there just like there, a storm is heading our ay, reading zipe's
translation of grimm's fairy tales, did you read the one
about the jew in the thornbush, i remember that
somewhere along the line when i was a kid
when i wa a kid a read
a book about a cocker spaniel
the nuremburg war trials volumes 1 and 2 the mediacal trials
the fairytale about the jew in the thornbush
a magazine i got from the american foresty association
the greek and roman plays in trnaslation
i liked antigone who i proncounced, well i pronounced her name
anti-gone, as if, just wait, i'll be around after you,
i'm gone "but also' anti-gone, yes, yes, yes
i take dismal pleasure in that a piece of my work
i don't know which, aybe just a word like codework
will surivive a century from now
(now they're talking about the oscars
so that i'll drag the memory of culture family famly ciulture
beind me, in won'd be around to know or see but i have my dreams, of
course
yes yes yes i have my dreams, theywill go on until
the money goes out or i go out or the oney and i go out, not that we
'go out' together, there's no one
to go out, just realized, as if this were a performance, no images!
video! real sound! to hold on to, the demons come out to play
in my brnai, there they are, there's no other eal, these demons
and the radio and the man on the roof and a fairly silent sunday morning
in the iddle of the city snow coming it's gonig to be an oscar party
day
someone said i was raw in my job betging i have no other gifts to give
and not even that what is an encounter between teaching
and being taught and both are taught and are teaching
we don't know how to listen, hoave you evder heard that,
thank you time for questions wait
i'll get the lights on, or someone will
i don't know where to find the swithc

As a professional film editor, educator, and author, Nathaniel
Dorsky's name is associated with a sublime and precise vision.

For forty years he has made his own personal films out of tender
encounters with the minute and the vast.  His ability to bring
an poetic but unsentimental eye to any subject matter has earned
him a career as consulting editor for numerous documentaries on
topics ranging from Sierra Club founder David Brower, the
personal stories American and Vietnamese War widows, the plight
of Tibetan buddhist nuns in captivity, and to the life and work
of literary figures such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and
Paul Bowles.

On the occasion of the release of the revised 2d edition of his
book of lectures on film "Devotional Cinema," (Tuumba Press)
Nathaniel Dorsky will join with Cinematheque to present his two
latest films: "The Visitation" (2002) and "Threnody" (2004),
both recent premieres at the reopening celebration of MoMA in
New York, and neither shown before in San Francisco.  These two
devotional songs will be preceded by "Triste" (1996), the first
work of a quartet of exquisitely photographed films from the
1990s.

Joel,

If, as Zukofsky writes, "The test of poetry is the range of pleasure it
affords as sight, sound, and intellection," then I don't necessarily think
Morice's poem misses "the point of poetry," though you may feel, in
overwhelming one with sound, it tends to ruin, or at least obscure, the
pleasure it affords. But I would hardly think this means it misses the
point, more that it seizes the point perhaps too firmly, in a way you may
find uncomfortable. Maybe you want poetry to obscure the point more -- I
don't know what you want. What is "the point of poetry," as you see it, anyway?

Joel,

Poetry has a point? =20

I don't think so, no more so than any work or art.

Some poetry is painful to read; other poems are equally painful to hear; =
yet too other poems are delightful, just to look at and experience =
visually printed on paper, and then, some verse makes me laugh while =
others just thrill and excite me, and some poetry is just plain boring =
no matter how I experience it: verbally, visually, audibly...on every =
level and on all levels simultaneously, some works just plain suck.  I =
know, because I've written a great many of those kinds of poems. =20

But, for the life of me, I don't see that any of the works, pleasing to =
me or unpleasant, had been created to achieve any "on point" status. =20

I'd be very interested in reading your views of what exactly the point =
of poetry is.
Thanks,
Alex
P.S. David Morice's work, "Tebahpla" was very pleasant visually, but =
falls into the slightly unpleasant category for me only in that I found =
the stanza lengths repetitively tiring (I mean 26 stanzas...) and that =
made the work of reading somewhat unpleasant.  However, I did enjoy the =
technical aspects of the poets accomplishment...perhaps if you looked at =
it as an Etude in verse writing you too might see more value in the =
piece than that it "missed the point..." =20

                              CFP - HYPERTEXT 2005
                 Sixteenth ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia

                                http://www.ht05.org/


The 16th International ACM Conference on "Hypertext and Hypermedia:
Concepts and Tools for Supporting Knowledge Workers"  will be held in
Salzburg, Austria, on 6-9 September 2005. Following in the footsteps of
early hypertext pioneers, the conference invites original contributions on
concepts, methodologies and tools for supporting knowledge workers. HT 2005
invites scholars, researchers and practitioners from all disciplines to
participate in this event and exchange ideas, theories and experiences
regarding the use of hypermedia to augment the capabilities of knowledge
workers.

Knowledge workers add value by processing existing information to create
knowledge that can be used to define and solve problems within
organizations. In achieving their objectives they continuously search,
gather, analyse, associate, compare and organize information. Confronted
with the vast amount of diverse information today, knowledge workers require
new concepts, methodologies and tools that boost their everyday activities.
The hypermedia community seeks to explore how to augment the skills of
knowledge workers and hence their efficiency.

In addition to interdisciplinary work describing the application of
hypermedia concepts and technologies in other fields, HT 2005 encourages

The point of poetry, of all creativity, as I see it, is to work through, or
leap past, all constraints.

I’ve been struggling with a new work....it is 90
percent done and needs honest destructing or praise
or anger or steel toed boots. It is based on some
speech to text poetics experiments all crafted into a
new media experience. There are heaps and heaps of
links and hidden things.

The title might still suck (gone through various
ramifications)…

“Promiscuous Design”

thanks in advance....

Christo's giving away the saffron squares seems to me
a "realization" of Ono's "Part Painting" which has had
variatous incarnations over the years. Sometimes a
vase or other object is broken and the physical pieces
are given to the audience. Other times it is purely
conceptual: cards are given out with part numbers
inscribed on them. At my Yoko Ono show/talk at the
Poetry Project last year I took a collaborative work
the audience created (a realization of Ono's
instruction for "Circle Painting" from Grapefruit) and
cut it into pieces to give to the audience. We had
pre-written part numbers on the other side of the
painting.

My favorite realization of this work is "Piece of the
Sky" which Ono I think had done before 9/11/01, but
re-did more widely after that. In this realization,
postcards were distributed with blue squares on them.
These were "pieces of the sky."

Importantly different from Christo's disassembling of
the "Gates" in two ways. First, Ono's "sky" while
along the lines of "framing device" like the Gates, is
purely conceptual, ie never existed in physical form,
though that sense of an intangible object (sky as
solid object) breaking in the days and weeks after
9/11 was very real in media and individual
consciousness (for me anyhow).

But second, in all of Ono's distrubution, there is
some kind of "promise" to meet again, to put the
broken object back together again. The meeting is
sometimes physical, ie delineated with specific time
frame ('in ten years' etc) sometimes cheekily physical
(not able to be actual, i.e 'March 33rd') and
sometimes purely conjectural, conceptual, or mental.


Just thoughts.

Edwin Torres
Nuyorican Futurist Performance Poet
and Recording Artist (Kill Rock Stars)
Author of The All-Union Day of the Shock Worker
(New York: Roof Books, 2001)

Performance Friday, March 4, 7:30 PM
The Scarab Club, 217 E. Farnsworth, Detroit
Preceded by an informal discussion at 11 AM
10th Floor Conference Room, 5057 Woodward
Wayne State University, Detroit

"Edwin Torres is the bastard love child of Vladimir Mayakovsky and Nicanor=
=20
Parra, midwifed by Guillaume Apollinaire," wrote Christian Haye in The=20
Poetry Project Newsletter. If there has ever been a poet who may be guilty=
=20
of hybridity or syncreticism or multiple influences or unnameable practices=
=20
or being over the top, it is Torres. Critics say things about him like,=20
"It's hard to wrestle meaning from the shreds of language he tosses out.=20
And on paper, Torres seems to make as much sense as a Port Authority=20
schizophrenic"--which is as much to say that they are impressed,=20
challenged, wondering, intrigued, and looking for more. Otherwise put,=20
Torres works between and among languages, aesthetics, genres, and makes new=
=20
meaning out of all of them. He is a master at creating new affects--states=
=20
of feeling that never existed until you saw them live on stage.

His bio reads: "Edwin Torres is a bilingual poet, rooted in the languages=20
of both sight and sound. He's been creating text and performance work since=
=20
1988. Mingling the textures of poetry with vocal & physical improvisation,=

where he=92s worked as workshop leader and curator. His debut CD Holy Kid=20
(Kill Rock Stars) combines poetry with music, sounds and homemade tapes,=20
and is included in the exhibition The American Century Pt. II at The=20

"From 1993-99, he was a member of the poetry collective, Real Live Poetry=20

Dear Friends of Just Buffalo,

The past several weeks have been extremely trying for the many residents,
workers and cultural organizations of Erie County. Although we do not yet
know the extent of the cuts to the $55,650 we were set to receive from Erie
County this year, the current version of the budget cuts us -- as well as 42
other small to mid-sized arts organizations -- to zero, which means we will
lose 15% of our operating budget. More importantly, the money we lose is
unrestricted, which means it can be used as needed for things like salaries
and rent.

As a supporter of Just Buffalo we want you to know that we are not in any
immediate danger of closing, and that we will continue to support the
writing community and teach the writing arts to under-served communities in
Buffalo despite the bungling of our politicians. But we also want you to
know that we are at significant risk of reductions in programming, staff
time, and staff positions, and that these reductions will necessarily
produce significant changes in the way we operate.

Successfully meeting this challenge will depend more than ever on the
communities we serve. To put it bluntly: to continue our mission we need our
supporters to reach into their wallets to make a donation. For 30 years,
Just Buffalo has been the only independent literary center in Buffalo.
Please help us make another 30 possible.

Sincerely,

The Board and Staff of Just Buffalo Literary Center

(2004). Most recently, one of Kurt's plays was chosen for the 2004 Toronto
Fringe Festival. Also know for his work as dramatic critic, Kurt has written

There comes a time in the life of every..bookstore (in this case this =
bookstore, Talking Leaves), when the desire to stock every useful, =
wonderful, compelling, exotic, interesting, unusual, extreme, =
essential..book smashes into (or in this case, gently nudges) the =
constraints of space and of stark economics.  Though keeping books on =
the shelves forever, or as long as possible, is the admirable and =
necessary goal of libraries, bookstores are different critters, =
requiring a different sustenance.  That overgrown forest at the original =
Talking Leaves on Main Street known as the poetry section has had to =
undergo some judicious culling and cutting, so that the new growth has a =
chance to thrive.  Confirmed poetry lovers can build or replenish their =
collections, and initiates can take a chance with these specially priced =
volumes.  All books in the specially priced sale section are now 40% =
off, and Talking Leaves and just buffalo members get an additional 10% =
off their purchases.

Some of these books have been on our shelves for a decade or more, and =
they will not be around forever, so we encourage you to stop by soon, =
and often.  Treat yourself to a bargain that will keep you mentally =
stimulated for the rest of your life, and help us to keep the gift that =
is poetry moving.  The sale section has plenty of other offerings as =
well.

Cynthia Sailers & Standard Schaefer

Local heroine Cynthia Sailers joins us in celebration of her first full-length
collection, Lake Systems, from Tougher Disguises. Sailers is a California
native (San Diego, 1974) who now lives in Alameda and co-curates the New
Brutalism Reading Series in Oakland. Her work has or will appear in various
journals, including Aufgabe, 14 Hills, LitVert.com, pompom, Small Tiger, Barn
(v.), and Involuntary Vision: Poems after
Kurosawa's Dreams.

Standard Schaefer's debut collection, Nova (Sun & Moon, 1999), was a National
Poetry Series selection. He is the former editor of Rhizome, and currently an
editor of The New Review of Literature, as well as a freelance journalist and
contributor to counterpunch.org. Newly relocated to San Francisco, Schaefer
joins us tonight in celebration of his second book, Water and Power, just out
from Agincourt Press.

For an historic note, when Christo was a teenager in Bulgaria - in the late
Forties -  one of his summer jobs was to live and work on a collective farm
located beside the Orient Express. He and other workers took responsibility
for ordering mowed hay into bales that they neatly stacked and covered with
colored tarps.
The image of these well ordered and colorful stacks was to present a
persuasive, well organized and aesthetically attractive image of the
socialist Bulgarian Government to travelers on the Orient Express - many of
whom were from Europe and America, including countries that were in high
debate about whether or not to become entirely or partially Socialist. The
covered hay stacks were considered a highly effective form of socialist
advertising.

Every time I see a Christo project I marvel at how his career has taken off
from that first Bulgarian experience in making public art occur in such a
diversity of contexts with a diversity potential intentions, or what more
often happens,  in a space of "non-intention" over which the artist waxes no
control. The materials are always only one half of the event; the other half
is what both individual and the public bring into the environment. It's in
this alchemy of the combination of materials and person(s) that something
transcends into another space - at least for a moment or a sustained moment.
In Hannad Arendt's terms, the site becomes a place of public disclosure - in
which the environment (including it's historical associations), objects and
persons become actors on a stage, one in which we partake both as our own
experience, and the witness to the enactments of those of others.  One
might, for examplem juxtapose this kind of public experience with Fox
Network (as a site) - where space is entirely enclosed, claustrophobically
so, and "we" as individuals or a group are permitted no disclosure at all.
Ideally its one in which authority - in all senses - returns to the members
of the Polis.

The Christos in that sense are only responsible for creating a stage that
permits the event.

massacre in Brazil:call to action 3/4/05

En / Pt / Es / Se

-------------------------EN----------------------------------------------

This is a call to action. There was a massacre here on February 16th at a
squatters encampment eviction. The squatters community is calling for a
global day of action, this friday on march 4th. They will march here
for justice for the disappeared and to reclaim their lost land. The
constitution of Brazil promises housing for the people and makes it illegal
to leave land abandoned and in speculation. The occupation was a fufillment
of that promise.

People from all over the world will be acting autonomously at Brazilian
consulates and embassies. Any action will be helpful no matter the size.
Have everyone call, fax, email. Enter and demand to be heard. Protest
outside against the police action and the cover up that followed. They have
bulldozed the entire community, destoryed almost 3000 homes, erased
important evidence, possibly corpses. These people acted spontaneously and
autonomously outside of political parties and organizations to occupy urban
blighted land. Please act together in solidarity with the poorest people of
Brazil who have risked their lives for a simple home.

Chicano Power: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow

Educate and Liberate!
Raza Studies Program
Spring Semester 2005


Pablo Aceves,  a member of Union del Barrio, a movement activist for
over 20
years,  and author of the The Stolen Revolution and numerous articles on
Raza
liberation,  will be the facilitator for this Raza Studies Session.  Pablo
will lead a discussion on what was meant by â€œChicano Powerâ€ in the late
1960s
and 1970s, and the significance of this term today. The discussion will be
lively and educational.


For almost two decades, the Raza Studies Programs have been held in various
barrios of San Diego:  in schools, community youth centers, and at Union
del
Barrio headquarters.

The objectives of the Raza Studies Program are:

1. Educate/Inform young people about Raza History, Politics, and Culture.
2. Through Raza Studies create/instill pride and positive self-esteem among
Raza youth.
3. Create unity among Raza youth and end the mindless violence that takes
place daily throughout the Barrios of Aztlan.
4. Assist/Motivate young Raza to continue their education (high school,
college, etc.).
5. Raise the social consciousness of youth and get them involved in the
struggle for Raza self-determination (create progressive social activists).
6. Prepare others (specially young people) to become Raza Studies
instructors
and teachers.


This Spring's Raza Studies Program is being organized in a round table
discussion (circulos de discusion) format/structure:   a guest presenter
is asked to
give comments on a particular issue and everyone is encouraged to asked
questions or give comments (feed back). We are currently on our six session
(discussion) of the Raza Studies Program Spring Semester 2005.  Past
sessions have
included (1) Introduction to Raza Studies, (2) Issues Facing Youth, (3)
Why Some
Raza
Youth End Up In Prison-The Reality of Prison Life, (4) Waking Up La
Raza: Why
and How To Publish a Newspaper or Newsletter in Your School or Barrio, (5)
and La Mujer Mexicana.

The six session of the Spring Semester will take place at 5 PM, Wednesday,
March 2 (2005), at the Yo Spot Youth Center, located on the corner of 41
and
Market St., San Diego.

Come and Learn.  Become an activist.  Support the Struggle. Participate in
the Raza
Studies Program.
Venceremos!

some slave
perished
over his oar -
these limbs
must belong
to some other slave,
fictional, a low motion
from a lofty actor
who cried to
applause "all moss
our cries all moss"
upon crisping
handfuls of
script to his lip
"we sang, mourn-
ful and wrong,
asphodel & asphodel,
the thorn smiled at
our names for the thorn"
