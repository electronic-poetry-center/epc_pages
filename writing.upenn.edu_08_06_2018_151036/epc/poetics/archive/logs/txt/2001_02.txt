Alan. are you sure you're not a computer yourself or at least an automated
digital Text-Maker? Your flood of work is so torrentious. I hope it is
cathartic for you. Some very interesting things stilll coming. A doer, a
maker, a creator: very clever, hard to keep up. But good on you. but I must
say: "It's all lies I tell you! Lies, you swine!" Yours

Dear List: Yes, I certainly noticed the nature of the nominees for
National Book Critics Circle. I notice continually. And almost
continuously.  But do we have any clue WHY not a single small press volume
is (ever) nominated? Can someone give any information about the processes
involved? or the personnel? or the backscratching?  What would happen if
(o please excuse this political limpness) a letter (wow) were composed
collectively by the denizens of this list and some superstar academics
(you know who you are Charlie and Marjorie and Bob) inquiring and
protesting and so on. I for one am just plain pissed (limp word) at the
delegitimation of everything I believe in, whether it is social justice or
poetic justice. It would be nice to make some sort of a noise, amid the
many other important socio-political noises one assumes people might
choose to make soon. Now, in fact. I'd be happy to help compose such a
letter and put my hard-earned name to it. Can we have a few facts of the
matter from those who might know? After the facts come in, maybe people
who could conceive of signing might email suggestions for a statement to
the list. I'll be happy to compile something brief and fight about wording
(something usually done best with about 5-10 people and not 230 or however
many are on the list, so I might have to be a tiny bit peremptory at some
point). I don't mean to dither into "procedure" (sometimes the last refuge
of scoundrels, but sometimes designed to protect us). You get my general
point. Sincerely, Rachel Blau DuPlessis

gee, bob.  you make it sound like a bad thing.  i'm guessing a lot more will
be going on than that at Poetry Plastique, but even if there wasn't so what?
'doing something new for the sake of doing something new' and being 'weird'
can be playful, generative, important practices.

Then he spoke and all the other gods gave ear"...

Dear Bob,

Poetry "off the page" is anything but new; rather, it's archaic (some
would say that it's at the very root of the art)--and enduring. Surely
you don't have a definition of "poetry" that would exclude an oral
composition that had never moved a hand holding pen or stylus?

In modern terms (which this exhibition no doubt will be more indebted
to), there is no shortage of precedent: the "poem-objects" of the
surrealists and after (including works by many current practitioners
whose credentials as "traditional" poets are unimpeachable, such as Jiri
Kolar and Nicanor Parra); concrete poetry; sound poetry--I'm sure I'm
not even scratching the surface.

In fact, I'd hazard to say that it's an arena in which it would be very
difficult indeed to seem truly novel. Which hardly diqualifies the
efforts of the artists involved.

Similarly, even if such works often have a relationship to "poetry" that
is metaphorical rather than literal, does that remove them from our
interest?

Yrs,

David Abel

How can anybody "move poetry off the page?"  Ten to one it's

A further note, again especially for the benefit of any listmembers in

two current exhibitions that very clearly demonstrate the viability of
poetry "off the page" (or, perhaps, the enlargement of the notion of the
page):

Damn Poets
=20
They hurt my head, they waste my time,
they suffer from self importance.
And half or more can't even rhyme
or write a line that makes some sense.
=20
They go to school for their degree
and later they write articles
about the Fall of Poetry,
or poems about the world's ills.
=20
I've heard enough pretentious verse
echo like farts in catacombs
to think that no one could be worse
than friends who let their friends write poems.

BUFFALO, NY
717-885-9535


featuring CHRIS ALEXANDER and MIKE KELLEHER, giving a talk entitled

        "RAISING KANE:  CLIFFORD KANE
                AND THE POETICS OF THE CRIME SCENE"


Chris and Mike's talk will focus on FILM, HUMOR, GANGSTERS and the FBI

Note: Clifford Kane was a former student of Louis Zukofsky.

Based on the Philly Talks series, RUST TALKS is a dialogue with contemporary
writers. The Rust Talks
newsletter features a discussion between two literary artists, either
responding to each other's work or concerning a topic in contemporary
poetics.  Rust Talks 5 's newsletter will be available in hard copy on the
day of the talk, and will eventually be posted on our web site
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/ezines/rust/).
"Rust Talks," the event, will present a reading or performance by the
authors, followed by a discussion which extends the newsletter conversation
to the audience.


Upcoming Talks:

                Laura Penny & Peter Ramos
                        March (exact date to be determined)

Hi Ron and others...

I discovered a page of Frank Stanford resources here:

http://www.clockwerks.com/frankstanford/

Somehow the navigation from the Alsop review is a little difficult, but
here's Lorenzo Thomas's essay on Stanford:

Sounds like an interesting poet; much to read...

POG

presents
writer Eileen Myles
Saturday, February 10, 7pm, Antigone, 411 N 4th Ave,
792-3715
Suggested Contribution: $5; Students $3

“The process of the poem, the performance of it I mentioned, is central to
the impression I have that life is a rehearsal for the poem, or the final
moment of spiritual revelation.”
-- Eileen Myles  “How I Wrote Certain of my Poems,” Not Me (1991,
Semiotext[e])

Eileen Myles was born in Cambridge, Mass. in 1949, was educated in Catholic
schools, and graduated from U. Mass. (Boston) in 1971. She moved to New York
in 1974 to be a poet. She gave her first reading at CBGB’s and then
gravitated to St. Mark’s Church where she studied with Paul Violi, Alice
Notley and Ted Berrigan. She edited a poetry magazine, dodgems, in 1977-79.
She ran the Saint Mark’s Poetry Project in 1984-86. She’s written several
plays: Feeling Blue, Parts 1, 2 & 3, Modern Art, and Our Sor Juana. Earlier
books of poems are Fresh Young Voice from the Plains  (New York : Power Mad
Press, 1981), Bread and Water  (Madras & New York : Hanuman Books), and Not
Me (New York : Semiotext[e], 1991).   Recently, Black Sparrow Press has
published her book of short stories Chelsea Girls (1994) and two books of
poems, Maxfield Parrish (1995) and School of Fish (1997).  She ran for
President of the United States in 1992.

Myles’ most recent book is the novel Cool for You (New York: Soft Skull
Press, 2000).  Dennis Cooper describes Myles as “one of the savviest voices
and most restless intellects in contemporary lit.”

AN ANNOUNCEMENT
Spring 2001 Writing Workshop:
POETRY AS BODY ART
with poet/performance artist
AKILAH OLIVER
Saturdays, March 3, 10, 17, and 24**12:30 to 2:30 pm.

Akilah Oliver is the author of the she said dialogues: flesh memory, which
was honored by the PEN American Center's Open Book Program 'Beyond Margins'
category for under-represented writers of color.  She is published in
numerous journals, magazines and anthologies including Chain, Bombay Gin,
High Risk 2, and The Little Magazine, and has read her work throughout the
US, most recently at the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church, NY, and the
Jack Kerouac School of Disembodies Poetics, The Naropa Institute, CO where
she has been on the faculty for the last three years.  As a founding member
of the post-feminist performance art group, the Sacred Naked Nature Girls,
she has also extensively performed experimental theatre works across the
country.

This unique up and coming writer comes to us with tremendous energy, skill,
and innovative flair.

POETRY AS BODY ART:  The workshops in this class integrate the continuum of
movement to theory (theory as 'the possibilities of language to contract
ideas that we can create work from or write in relationship to/with, or
make-up ourselves', not as a rarefied, exclusive academic lingo, though that
theory is not excluded) back to movement, leading to written work.  The class
will explore the female/male/re-gendered body/ies, the physical terrain of
'flesh memory' -embodied personal and cultural myths/truths that live in the
individual body.  The classes are designed to investigate the contentions of
memory tricks, useful fictions, gender constructions, and cultural
conceptions of the self.  Many of these constructions are so multi-layered
they reveal themselves in new and surprising ways when language is prompted
through creative movement exercises. *  The class will also feature writing
exercises and critiques.  *(what I like about this workshop is that it is
fluid, beautiful, accessible to writers of all levels, builds community
w/participants and is so much simpler in action than it sounds)  A.O.

Course fee: $100/$80 members. Class size limited to 10.
Deadline: February 17, 2001.
Registration cannot be processed without payment.

sorry for cross-posting

(with typos and all...)

When you've known someone forty five years, its hard if not impossible to
ever feel that they have left you forever. If you believe in an afterlife,
or the enduring stregnth of the spirit, there is no forever. There is only a
seperation in time till you are rejoined with all your old friends. In the
case of Gregory Corso, his spirit was/is so strong that during hisfuneral
service at Our Lady of Pompei Church in Greenwich Village, where he was born
and baptized, his spirit filled the whole church and overflowed into the
streets. These were the New York city streets he always loved and remembered
no matter where his journeys led him in his life's travels.

We met in 1956, and with all the times we spent together in the fifties,
walking those same streets of downtown New York City, engaged in heated
discussions about music, poetry, Baseball, mutual romances, and how we could
survive and pursue our mutual seemingly impossible dreams, there was never a
moment that we didnt have fun, laugh, shout, yell, and often share some
reverent moments of silence , appreciating the magic spirit that seemed even
then to be a part of that amazing era. We knew without even saying it that we
were part of something special.

The energy filled the air. The new masters of jazz ,painting , poetry,
the theater and all related arts were all sharing their gifts with all the
rest of us and we had our own reporter to document it in a new novel that
told the world about itself, as well as about all of us, In spite of the
critical savaging of Jack Kerouac within a year after the publication of his
monumental "On the Road", we knew that we had a friend who was opening the
door for all of us. And Gregory knew he had a lifelong friend in Jack as
well as myself and many ,others who were walking the same path. We were all
searching , in our own way, to celebrate the beauty that was all around us
thAt was being ignored or destroyed by a loveless society that was screaming
out for some soulfulness and joy.

Jack always knew that Gregory had a gift that was given to him at birth.
Jack, like Gregory, never tried to merchandize his own deep spirituality.
Like Gregory, he lived the life of his own spiritual quest. None of us ever
asked people to sign up to become members of a cashcow organization
designede to make you more holy. All that came later on in the Sixties, and
neither Jack, Gregory or myself had anything to do with it. We all had
religeous roots that stayed with us for life.The only time Jack ever
addressed any of his own feelings of his connection to a higher power was
when he told me in a rare immodest moment after he had completed his
extraordinary improvised rap-narration for the film "Pull My Daisy" while I
jammed behind him, that he, Jack Kerouac, was touched by the hand of God.
Gregory never said this about himself, but a few of us then, and many of us
now know that his gift was inexplicable, and that he was born to be a poet.
His knowledge of his own natural gifts freed him from any doubts about why he
was here, and like so many of the major talents of this rich era, he let life
take him to wherever he seemed destined to be at the moment, knowing that as
long as he could keep writing, he was doing what he was here to do.
We talked many times about how we could live our lives pursuing our
dreams and still have some kind of family, scince we also shared a mutual
love of kids and wanted to have families of our own some day.
"Who would be crazy enough to marry either of us?" he often said to me
during the wee hours of our late night/early morning field trips down the
wilds of MacDougal Street.

With surprising frequency, "I would" was immediatly uttered at 6a.m. by a
young woman who we had just met an hour ago. Gregory in those days was
irresistable to many women, but he always had an intuitive bond that he
maintained with whoever he was with at the moment. This innate sensitivity
made him more empathetic than most of the rest of us.He took the time to care
for others. He was not career oriented in any way, and as a result could talk
to anybody about the beauty of the moment, rather than about himself. He
knew how to listen, and how to share.

This is why in his final few months, his children,my children and so many
old friends came to see him so often. The love that he kept in his heart,
often hidden to strangers, was as pure as his poetry.

He was never comfortable with the whole Beat phenominon .He often said to
me that the myth-making about of all of us, which none of us wanted or
needed, clouded the whole picture. We all felt our work could speak for
itself.

He would often poke me with his elbow , when we appeared together in the
80s and 90s, as Kerouac's genius was being rediscovered and we would attend
conferences and all kinds of events where we were forced to listen to experts
talk about the hidden meaning behind significent events in our lives that
never actually occured.

"See that Mezz?" Gregory would whisper in my ear, with enough volume to
fill up the whole room(My name , Mezz McGillicuddy was the one Jack Kerouac
gave to me in the film "Pull My Daisy" that Gregory and I appeared in back in
1959) .

"It's the beat mythology shot. They'd rather deal with myths than speak
with us and find out what was happening and is still happening.I'm still a
poet man. So was Jack, It's all in our books. They can find out all they need
to know up there on the shelf where our books lie. We'll be judged by our
books on the shelf. Jusyt like you with your symphonies. How can people that
weren't even there tell us who we are and what we were thinking? Why don't
they ask us first and get it right?"

When "Mindfields" was reissued by Thundersmouth Press, I was asked to
write a new introduction to accompany the other forwards by Burroughs and
Allen. I mentioned the fact that Gregory was such a colorful personality as
a performer that people often overlooked his real value as a major poet
and one of our true originals.

In the last few years as I criss-cross the Globe, in concerts and seminars,
young people in many countries(and finally throughout the USA as well) ask me
about Gregory. They inquire about his work, and about his life outside the
imagery created by his public personna. They say,as they always say about
Jack ,that they feel they know him as a result of reading his books. Young
people would give me messages, poems, songs and stories to give to Gregory.
I always tried in some way to relay these messages of love when I would see
him or talk to him on the phone.

I was also asked for years why Gregory wasn't acknowledged as much as he
deserved to be. I always explained that he was only interested in being ther
best that he could be, and that the excellence of his work was all that
concerned him. In the past few years he is finally being recognized for his
contributions by a larger audience then he ever dreamed of. He often told me
how uncomfortable he was having to perform at events where he was supposed to
portray the Pecks Bad Boy image, or worse yet ,be the Clown Prince of Beat
poetry.

"I'm a classicist, Mezz," he used to say, "I'm a lyric poet from the
tradition. When are they going to drop this Beat crap and judge me on my
merits?"

That time has finally arrived. At last, Gregory is emerging in the peer
culture as a unique artist whose work can be judged by its own intrinsic
merit. Like Kerouac, he is being percieved as an original artist who, by
virtue of his lifetime of achievement, can stand alone. No label is necessary
to understand either of them.

In early Fall when his devoted daughter Sheri took him to Minneapolis and
I saw him for the last time in New York, I told Sheri and Roger(his dear
friend for so many years} that I would try to ask a group of young poets ,
musicians and appreciators of Gregory's work to get together and make a video
to send him in Minneapolis. This way, he and his family could watch his
poetry being read with music, the way we did forty five years ago ,by a whole
new generation of young artists. In November, I had the good fortune to be
chosen as the
honorary chairperson the the first New York Underground Music and Poetry
Festival in New York. I asked the organizers, poets Casey Cyr and Ron
Whitehead , if we could do this for Gregory while he was still with us. They
were nice enough to get the Newyorican Poets cafe to give us a night during
the festival where the featured performance would be a reading of Gregory's
poetry with music. It went over beautifully, with a lot of joy, and no
maudlin or self serving rants. The whole hour was filled with the sunshine
of Gregory's spirit, guided by the beauty of his words that we celebrated.
The musicians who played with me listened to every second of what was being
spoken, and with our old tradition of no rehearsal, it all came out
flawlessly because everybody listened to each other.We all respected every
line of Gregory's poetry.

I mailed him a copy of the video,and he watched it many times in
Minneapolis. When I spoke to him on the phone for the last time, he
said"Mezz, I understand how you always confused Keats and Shelly, but I
forgive you because the video was great. Tell all those people who read and
played...Thanks"

We talked a little more that night. We remenisced about old times, when we
had an unexpected grand reunion,running into each other in SanFranciso with
Neal and Allen in 1965 in a tiny bar in Haight Ashbury. We recalled the jam
session in 1956 at a famous painter's loft when he played drum beats on a
series of pots and pans while Jack and I were scat singing till we were all
thrown out at 3am. I reminded him about the great picture taken of him
during the program we participated in at the National Portrait Gallery in
Washington DC in the late 90s ,where he was photographed reading his poetry
under an oil painting of George Washington.

And finally we talked about his kids and my kids and how they were all so
grown up.

"Old times, Dave.Good times. We'll be together soon again.Goodnight Mezz."
Those were the last words I heard from Gregory. At the church, after I
accompanied Patti Smith in a beautiful version of an old hymn that we both
played together for the first time, I spoke briefly.I began by reading
touching statements by
Laurence Ferlinghetti and Robert Creeley, both of whom I called a few nights
before the funeral. They weren't able to come, so they gave me their messages
to read. Then I asked the people in the church to remember Gregory's shining
spirit,and to celebrate the joy and laughter he brought to our lives. I
mentioned that so many of us came from other places to New York and to
Greenwich Village, searching for something we knew was there. When we said
hello to Gregory for the first time, he told us all that this was where he
was born. Now we were in the same place to say goodbye.

I also thanked the priest for letting all of us share the place where
Gregory began his life journey, and where he told his daughter Sheri he
wanted to have his farewell.I reminded everyone that Gregory , Jack and I
often would quote to other aspiring artists and dreamers the classic maxims
-that an artist must burn with a hard and gem like flame(Ruskin)by your works
ye shall be known(the Bible ) and that a thing of beauty is a joy forever(we
always argued whether Keats took it from Shelly or Shelly took it from Keats)
And I told everyone that we had to remember Gregory's family and treasure the
gift to the world of his beautiful children his grandchildren and his
relatives that are still with us.

The church was full of people who wanted to read a poem, sing a song or
tell a story. This will all happen many times in many places for years to
come because Gregory's star will shine brightly when all of us are gone. His
work will always be here to remind us and future generations that you can
follow your heart, and if you remain honest and dedicated to what you dream
to set out to do, you can lift peoples spirits and make the world a better
place through your work, just as Gregory did.

Not to mention micro-press volume, but that goes without saying.
Not to mention book by a craft-extending poet, but that goes
without saying.

I'm a member of the organization but stopped wasting time
nominating books by uncertified poets a while back.

ago.  It is now called "The Text Assessment Center."
Not a snappy name, but the snappy domain names
were all gone by the time I applied for one.  I
can be visited by typing http://www.text-assessment.com.
Or clicking the preceding.  Here's my present blurb for it.

Do you have a letter-to-the-editor that's too intelligent
for the publication you sent it to to print?  Or a book
review that's too comprehensive for Amazon.com, or on a
book that was put out too long ago or is too uncommercial
for a "reputable" publisher of book reviews to use?  Or do
you want to review a book or article  (or website) frankly
but don't want to sign your name to it because of the enemies
it could make you?  If your answer to any of the above is
"Yes," this is the site for you!

Send me some stuff--I want to get my site into a higher gear.
So far, it has two reviews of mine, and one dopey one on the
Book of Mormon by Anon. that I put up because my intention
is to put up everything readable and not too obscene (for
Yahoo, not me, for whom nothin's too obscene) that's sent
to me.  An' tell your friends about it!

Performing poet, singer Maya Dorn presents her own original and poignant
work in song / language / music -- a work with a sharp, refined ear that
finds true speech in the raw and cooks it with a troubadour's passion.
She extends and gives a further life to the inimitable poetic
discoveries of her father, Edward Dorn, whose Gunslinger has located and
sustained a unique domain of being for decades and beyond. Maya finds
its outer reaches only a poet of her gender, direct presence, sense of
responsibility and humor could tell this way.

 Subject:      Maya Dorn Performance   Date:      Sun, 4 Feb 2001

IMPORTANT LAST MINUTE BULLETIN

Alternative Books is proud to present Singer/Songwriter Maya Dorn this
Tuesday evening, February 6, at 8 pm at the Flying Saucer Café, 33 N.
Front
St. in Kingston. Admission is $5.00.

A songwriter since the age of twelve, Maya has developed her own style
and vision.  She approaches music from the vantage point of cultural
observer and poet, stretching her lyrics in soaring melodies or as
spoken
word.  Maya was first recognized on the national scene as the front
woman in the band Skin, on lead vocals and electric guitar.  A band for
three years this highly creative quartet started a dancing frenzy
wherever
they went.  Now playing solo acoustic and electric, Maya is becoming
known for her soulful stage presence and poignant songwriting.

Maya has toured nationally as a solo artist and with her band Skin.  She

has appeared on albums by The Dave Watts Motet, the Afro-Cuban
folkloric ensemble, Guauancheros, and Libby Kirkpatrick.  Her music
has been chosen for three compilation CDs.

[Daughter of the late Edward Dorn, author of Gunslinger and other
major works of poetry, Maya's work carries on a lineage of
transformative American poetics.]

Maya’s recordings include:

1995 Acoustic Coffee & News    compilation CD
1996 Maya Dorn      solo tape
1996 Pack of Dogs      compilation CD
1997 Don’t Buy the Man Another Drink  Skin album
1999 Women from Mars    compilation CD
2000 Driving Away     Solo demo CD
2001 Blow it to Rags     Solo album


“Maya Dorn makes me want to deport myself for the good of all
mankind.  I want to give her all my money.  She is beautiful, soulful,
humble, talented, unusual, and sound.  I love her music.”
-Rose Polenzani
Daemon Records recording artist

“Thoughtful and provacative songwriting...hints of urban scat and
pastoral
glide.”
-David Kirby
Music critic, Colorado Daily

“Advice from Rosalie Sorrels: Listen to Maya Dorn!  She’s got grace,
style and sense of humor. A first rate emerging talent.
-Rosalie Sorrels
Rounder Records recording artist


Please don’t miss this opportunity to hear a truly unique and exciting
talent. Pass the word to your friends since there has been little media
coverage on this event.

Thanks,
Gary Wilkie

As an NBCC member who reviews quite a bit of off-center poetry (and who
thus shares Rachel's frustration with this year's nominations), I can
perhaps shed a little light on the subject. NBCC members are sent a ballot
with the newsletter in early January, and can nominate as many as five
titles in any given genre. Titles appearing on 20% percent or more of the
ballots submitted are eligible for the final group of five nominees.
(Sometimes more than five titles qualify, so the Board or some subset
thereof has to determine who's in and who's out.) For the final decision on
a winner, the NBCC Board meets and votes (and argues) until they come to a
consensus. So, like many awards systems, it starts as a numbers game and
ends up as a committee decision (i.e., an exercise in persuasion). To be
fair, the Board does publish a somewhat detailed report on its
deliberations in its newsletter after the awards are given. I certainly
list out-the-mainstream titles on my ballots, but of course a number of
other reviewers need to nominate those titles as well for any of them to
get the necessary 20%. Again, as in other aspects of life, the ones with
the most PR (ads, reviews in mainstream mags, AWP schmoozing) tend to get
the most votes.

Angry letters -- while they're great for letting off steam -- probably
won't change anything. What's my solution? To all of you on this list who
publish reviews in SPT or Am. Book Review or Rain Taxi or other uncommonly
eclectic mags, join the NBCC! Send them some clippings, pay the annual
dues, and vote for whichever books you think deserve the award. As I said,
it's a numbers game, and the more critics who support innovative poetry in
the NBCC the better. Whenever I vote for, say, Rosmarie Waldrop or Paul
Hoover or C.S. Giscombe I know I'm pretty much alone in my opinions, and
that gets discouraging. (In fact, I didn't even bother voting this year.)
So please, keep me company, somebody!

Linda Bohe -- Collected Poems -- now on-line

Linda Bohe died in 1983 at the age of 33.  She lived in Boulder and then
NYC.  She studied with Alan Dugan, William Matthews and Richard Hugo. Her
terse syntax perhaps reminds one of Hugo, but with a more eclectic range of
subject matter.  Her broad range of poetic taste was shown in the magazine,
Attaboy, which she edited with Phoebe MacAdams.

Once again, we invite you who might be in town to take part in the event

The Politics of Presence: Re-reading the Writing Subject in "Live" and
Electronic Performance, Television and Theatre Poetry

Two days and evenings of papers, discussions and performances focussed on
newly locating and understanding writerly subjectivity as it is evidenced
in the production of innovative work by poets engaged in new media and
performance modes.  Poets/performers from the U.K., U.S., Ireland and
France will join in the critical discussion as well as demonstrate aspects
of their practice.  Evening performances will be open to the public (free
to conference registrants); others will take place during the days'
conversations as input in the ongoing discussion.  For a description of
the issues to be discussed, please see our website: www.brookes.ac.uk/prc

Emotional Politics


This is fucking disgusting! Stop writing me!

Goddamn Internet! I'm fucking attacked on one hand by Nigerian spanners
offering me a big piece of 26 million dollars, and attacked on the other
hand by corporate assholes who stick banners like knives across the
eyeballs; the hackers are our only hope; someone's got to bring the whole
fucking system down!

We better stop sending cute Bush jokes around! It's like finding funny
stuff in Mein Kampf! How the hell do you resist! We're all in the shtetl!
We didn't know it! When I walk down that hall, Bush will pull the lever!
Just watch! Fuck DNA! I did it! I did it! Whatever it is!

Bush and his creepy team can go screw themselves! They've already screwed
the rest of the country! Proto fascists, they promised compromise and as
soon as they seized power, they showed their true colors as racists and
violent fundamentalists! Women's rights will be all but dead in a year or
two! We'll all be in jail for un-Amerikkkan activities! The jails, already
the largest on earth, will be bursting with blacks, jews, atheists, anyone
who doesn't lick the ass of Christ! Fuck Bush! There's a war on; the more
Republicans, the more thugs! We're all dead unless we fight back! Who
wouldn't love to see Washington DC burn!

Goddamned Israelis held hostage by the religious right, Arab kids taking
potshots at them! So now we'll have fascist Sharon to contend with; if
he's a jew, I'm not! I can't even recognize myself in his murderous fat
face! It's the people that look like tailors I fear the most! Meanwhile
I'd be scared to live in Jerusalem or just about anywhere in the mid-east
and I wouldn't know who the hell to fear!

What the hell is going on with the southern region of Russia, rogue gangs
and missing plutonium! We'll all go to hell if India and Pakistan don't
take us there first! Why can't they get along! Are we really going to bomb
the hell out of each other! Bush wants to ride the first bomb down! But
radiation's the new abortion! Look at Japan! Singapore! China! Go there!
Don't go there! You can't fight burning bodies on the Square!

Marx is dead, the left's unarmed and kissing Republican ass! In this coun-
try we love Mexico now! All those kids in the aging creaking sweatshop
system! With Bush we can rape them! Canada's another story! Fuck Canada!
Bush can't even find it! The Quebecois hold everyone hostage! You can't
even build a new plant without worrying about the dollar! Look at Europe,
racist and smug! Everyone wants a nationalist piece of the pie! Let them
eat cake!

While I'm writing this, Bush is signing secret orders for concentration
camps! Help the Montana economy! North Dakota! Not too many people! A
little town called Auschwitz!

Look at the agony in Afrika! Why can't the US and Europe give reparations!
We just about slaughtered the continent in the 19th-century!

Why aren't people armed here! Why is it always right-wing assholes who
carry guns! Why don't the Democrats in Congress throw bombs! What are they
scared of! They've already lost their jobs, they just don't know it! I
want to sell drugs and oil! I want to sell guns and bombs! There's got to
be a way to make money in this criminal administration! Fucking thieves!
Murderers! Screw them!

The US is the so-called most bloated country on earth yet you can't get
health care here; half the seniors are going without food so they can
afford medication shit out by obscene pharmaceuticals! People eat dogfood
here to survive! Fuck them all! The fucking rich are getting richer; they
should be on death row! The poor are barely making it! God forbid if
you're black or poor and ill or just about anyone other than a rich white
male!

Fuck Bush! He thinks: Who needs electricity! His ass is glistening with
oil! His ass runneth over! So what if California collapses! They didn't
vote for him! They're probably fucking jews! arabs! blacks! He'll rob them
blind!

Fuck Florida! Fuck the fascists just itching to take over the US! They'll
show the rest of the world! They've got the fucking weapons and they're
not afraid to use them! They'll go to heaven licking Christ's ass in
eternal rapture and leave the rest of us to die here! You can already
smell the corpses!

I forwarded Richard Taylor's entertaining screed to a friend and received
this in response.  We should all find it instructive, if not even a bit
poetic.  -Aaron

*****

Richard Taylor wrote, re: the semicolon:

> souls) as mystifying, as The Word itself

I beg to differ.  The birth of the semicolon is clearly attested in the
manuscript tradition of Latin-speaking Europe.  While in some manuscripts
of antiquity words were separated by medial points (Latin _punctus_, hence
our "punctuation"), most Latin books were written continuously--i.e., with
no spaces between words, and no punctuation.  While some, such as the
4th-century grammarian Donatus and the 6th-century patron of monastic
learning Cassiodorus, suggested a system based on the Greek model, in
which short rhetorical sections (called _commas_) were marked by a medial
point, longer sections (_colons_) by a point after the bottom of the last
letter, and the longest sections (_periodus_) by a point after the top of
the last letter, punctuation was abandoned for the most part until the
Carolingian period (with the notable exception of the system suggested by
Isidore of Seville [d. 636], in which sections ended with points at the
top or bottom of the line, while sentences ended with a group of two or
three points, one of which might be a comma rather than a simple point).
It was under the direction of Charlemagne and his advisor, Alcuin of York,
that the Carolingians developed a miniscule script and a system of
punctuation that are the ancestors of the script and punctuation we use
today.  In addition to the interior stops of a sentence indicated by
medial points or periods and the groups of points used to indicate the end
of sentences, the _punctus elevatus_ (a period with an apostrophe above
it) and the _punctus interrogativus_ (our question mark) were employed in
order to facilitate the reading of texts.  While these marks of
punctuation have undergone significant modification since the 8th century,
and while they have developed differently in various regions (note, for
example, the French use of guillemets >> << instead of quotation marks to
indicate direct speech) they nevertheless can be looked to as the direct
predecessors of the punctuation we use today.  The _punctus elevatus_,
which was introduced to indicate a pause greater than that of a comma,
but not a full stop, along with an inflection of a voice--the sort of
pregnant pause one might want to employ inbetween sentences that treat
closely related ideas--is the predecessor of our semicolon.

There ... that's not mysterious at all, is it?  And see ... those
paleography classes I've taken really were worth something after all.

pax vobiscum,

JDH

ps: By the way, I think it is interesting that for much of its history
punctuation existed for elocutionary purposes.  It was really only in the
late 16th century that it was suggested that it ought to be employed for
syntactical ends.  I'm sure that's somehow related to the fact that for
most of the history of the written word, people only read out loud.  That
makes sense for all of the texts that were written continuously--the only
way you can figure out what they are saying is if you sound them out--and
also would explain why, when punctuation was introduced, it was for the
benefit of reading aloud (silent reading didn't become common until the
later Middle Ages).  I've heard it suggested that poets and writers of
fiction still tend to apply punctuation in an elocutionary manner, while
us non-fiction drones tend to be constrained by syntactical models.  Fair
to say?

David Lawrence




David is one of the folks what put out Mudfish, from NYC.  No email address, but he lists
360 E. 72nd Street, NY, NY 10021 as his snailmail address.


                Good Conversation

     My brother was running the family business, a chain of funeral homes.  When I was young I
used to sneak into the Madison Avenue location and speak to the corpses.  I felt they had a
special wisdom.  I once put an apple in a dead old lady's mouth.  It fell out dragging her dentures
with it, smashing on the floor.  I casught hell for that.

     So with my father in the slammer, my mother recovering from the stress of my father's
incarceration by traveling around Europe attending society parties and my older brother adding
up the monthly corpses against the overhead, I pretty much had the palatial Park Avenue pad to
myself.

      My dad was doing "vacation" time at Club Fed for tax evasion.  He had charged a summer
home in East Hampton to the office, pretending it was a business expense.  We had a staff of
three there who were deducted as office help.  My father also deducted his car expenses, his
yacht and his helicopter and crew.  I loved our summers in the Hamptons.  We used to have
stables there where we kept polo ponies.  One of them drowned in our Olympic sized swimming
pool.  My dad had it stuffed and mounted it in the entrance hall.

     The Internal Revenue Service took the home from us.  And the yacht and the helicopter.
They left us the stuffed polo pony which we moved into our Park Avenue apartment.

     You have no idea how much this richly furnished fifteen room duplex impressed the girls I
met at N.Y.U. where I was majoring in English.  I had a sad, sensitive face with dreamy bedroom
eyes and a strong chin that a Hispanic girl told me felt great when she ground it against her
pelvis.  It reminded her of a Fuller brush.  She'd warn me not to shave days before she planned
to have sex with me.  She liked it rough.

      A beautiful WASP who was modeling for Ford Modeling Agency to pay for her education and
majoring in philosophy used to tell me to keep my eyes open when we screwed so that she could
look into them and understand the vast deserts of the semetic races.  She'd talk the time we
screwed about how there was Hebrew in my eyelashes and the Old Testament in my underarms.
My penis was the Torah.  Just before she'd come she'd yell Jahweh and shout at me to wink.  I
had long black eyelashes.  She said sh'd give her left tit to have them.  So I'd flutter my
eyelashes and she'd come.  After, she'd tell her friends that she didn't get fucked by me, she got
lashed.  She'd quiver like an ancient sacrifice, roll over and say, "I'm dead."  I'd then inspect her
asshold for scarebs.

      I rarely did a girl more than two or three times.  I felt that there was a frailty about
relationships based on all the time I spent in the mortuary.  All things came to a funereal end and
there was no sense in my getting too attached to anyone.  Better to break off the relationship
myself than to find it laid out on a slab at Finkelstein's Funeral Homes.  That is, if my family was
lucky enough to get the account.  By the way, my name's Jonathan Finkelstein.

     This girlfriend hopscotch stopped when I met Tracie.  And looking back at it I still can't figure
out why I let all my other girls lapse as I got more and more involved with her.  Tracie was no
better looking or more intelligent than any of the others.,  She was a so-so skinny blond with
sunny blue eyes and a smiley, spearmint fresh disposition.  I liked that about her.  I didn't like
angry women.  If she had a dark side it was so hidden that it might as well not have existed.  She
never asked me anything challenging, never said anything profound and if the conversation
turned political she'd purse her lips and kiss me or let tears well up in her blue eyes and pray for
the boys who were dying in Vietnam.  I'd stand at attention and give a mock twenty-one gun
salute for our dead green berets.  Not that I gave a damn about dead soldiers.  My family
buiness was death.  I just wanted to let her feel I was on her side, to keep her hot.  Because the
sex, if not fantastic, was interesting, spooky and reliable.

    When my apartment was empty, which was often, she and I liked to screw behind the drapes
in the living room.  The living room was huge, with high ceilings like a ballroom, and looked out
onto Park Avenue on the third floor.  The stuffed polo pony stood in the middle of it.  It looked
out of place.  But my father always liked that hourse and without the Hampton home he had no
place else to put it.

     Tracie and I would stand behind the drapes, close the shades and she'd sit on the window sill
as I'd hump away between her sweet, milky thights.  Once she purposely let the shade up so that
elderly peeping Toms from the other pre war coops and the pedestrians on the street could have
a gander.  I closed my eyes like an ostrich.  When she came she whispered, "My king, I am your
treasure chest.  I have gold coins inside me."

     All I kept thinking was, "Ducats.  Fuck it. Ducats. Fuck it."

     I reached up to pull the shade down, opened my eyes and saw three construction workers
laughing and pointing at us.  The shade came off and fell on top of us.  We rolled on the floor
and got all caught up in it.  When I tried to hang the shade back up, I couldn't.  That night my
mother  came home from Europe with sixteen valises, saw the shade all crumbled up on the
windowsill and asked me what happened.  I said I think ghosts did it.  My mom was superstitious
and called a spychic, an astrologist and a witch and had them de-ghost the apartment.  For a
week I wasn't allowed to wear shoes because I might step on the good fairies.

     Amy was an artistic girl in my painting class.  I met her around the time I became involved
with Tracie.  She was Tracie's opposite.  She had brown frizzy hair with black eyes and a zoftig
body that was rich and creamy like kugel.  She wore long flowing gowns like the Krishnas and
had a dark, spiritual, other worldly sense of life.  She was a cultist without a cult; a feather flying,
detached from a bird.

     Amy and I sat next to each other in class.  She was a great painter.  I stank.  In high school
my teacher had said that I couldn't draw a straight line with a ruler.  Then she gave me an "A' for
my use of color.  I wanted to be a poet not a painter.  But I thought that poets should be able to
point, that words were little squibs of color, that I should be familiar with a pallet, brush and oils.

     I admired Amy's work.  We became fast friends.  We had good conversations together about
the meaning of life.  We once played Russian roulette with cap guns to get the sense of life's
preciousness.  She was the most spiritual girl I'd ever met.

     "The spirt is the water in a goldfish bowl without the bowl.  Without the fish," she said to me
when we were eating hot dogs by Bethesda Fountain in Central Park.  There was a dead fish
floating in the fountain.  She said a Hindu prayer.

     I admired her loftiness.  Even if I came from a background of mummifying bodies.  She had a
soul the size of the colliseum.  I wanted to sponsor gladitorial events in her.  Her spirit rose
above the bleechers.  I imagined it would be a religious experience to be married to her.  If only I
could feel sexually attracted to her.  I prayed that she'd excite me.  I once lit a candle asking God
to let her turn me on.  I then tried to beat off over the candle thinking about her.  But Tracie
came into my mind and I burned my dick before the come put the candle out.

     "That's great," I said looking over at her canvas.  She had painted a perfect likeness of the
fat, hairy nude who was posing for the class.  Blubber behind his arms dripped into spots of
muscle, his rounded back sprouted hairs like hill grass and his spread legs caught stale thunder.
On top of all this debauched flesh she put an innocent, fresh modest face that seemed to be
apologizing for its body.  The model was only in his t\wenties.  He looked like a nice guy.  But I
couldn't figure out what he was doing perching himself naked in such degradation.  There was a
glint in his eye of freindly resignation to his own ugliness.

     I hadn't painted a line on my canvas yet.  All i had done was colorful background.  Yellows
melding into blues; reds falling onto greens and purples announcing their startling tackiness.

     "Nice color," Amy said.

     "You think so?"

     "Sure.  But why are you drawing the background first?"

     "To let it influence the foreground."

     "You have to draw the model first."

     "When it speaks to me."

     "Giuseppe, speak to him," she said.

     "What should I say?" the fat model asked.  The teacher came over and told him to shut up.

     I went back to painting the background.  The bell rang and I headed down to the cafeteria with
Amy to get a snack.  We both had Hostess cupcakes and coffee.  Her table manners weren't
very good.  I looked at her mashing a cupcake into her mouth with the cream filling dripping
down her lip as she made chewing sounds.  I was disgusted.  I didn't understand how someone
so spiritual could eat like such a slob.

     Was I wrong to be so repulsed by her lack of etiquette?  I told myself I was a bad person to
feel this way.  That table manners were bourgeois conventions and that Amy was above such
nonsense.  But when I was a kid table manners were the most important thing in the world to my
father.  He once bought me a new bicycle when I was six because I was able to explain the
difference between the salad fork and the regular fork to my relatives at a Passover Seder.  He
raised my allowance when I played a trick on my friend, giving him a finger bowl and watching
him drink it as if it were soup.  He tought that was a sophisticated joke.  He wanted me to be a
gentleman.  I wondered if he now told the cons he was dining with at Allenwood Federal Prison
Camp that they shouldn't slurp when drinking their soup.

     I was tempted to tell Amy that she shouldn't chew with her mouth open.  But I had too much
respect for her brushstrokes.  She was above table etiquette.  And yet.  And yet if I could reform
her debilitated manners I might be able to talk myself into going to bed with her.  We could
become lovers.  I'd drop Tracie and marry her, my true, spirtual soul mate.  We'd have good
conversation and I'd be enlightened by the headlights of her spirituality.

     No, no, no.  It was not her that had to change.  It was me.  I had to find the true Amy in the
jungle of gestures, the spirit in her flesh's mistakes, the aesthete in the slobber.

     "I broke up with Gary, you know," she said.

     "What happened?"  She had been going out with Gary for a year.  He was a good looking guy
who was majoring in economics.  This left the field open for me.  Did I want to enter?

     "I couldn't take all those numbers anymore.  Life is not a balance sheet.  Money, money,
money, money!  He didn't care about Vietnam, feminism, integration; any of the important
things.  All we had in common was sex.  If you're not a soul mate, there's no sense, is there?"

     I though of Tracie and how the sex was everything.  How I once licked her when she was
hanging upside down from the chandelier in the living room.  The lights seemed to glow brighter.
And how I dry humped her under my fathers stuffed polo pony when she had her period and had
tide hermself with shirts to the horse's hooves.

     "Sex can be the main thing," I said, wishing I could get turned on by her.

     "You're deeper than that," Amy said.  There was a cockroach walking across the table.  She
squashed it with her finger.  I almost puked.

     "Don't get me wrong.  Sex is best with some you love," I said.  And I looked at Amy's oval,
Modiglianish face and hoped that someone might be her.

     "Someone like you,"  Amy said.

     She took the words out of my mouth.

     "Someone like you," I said.  I stared into her black moon eyes and touched myself under the
cafeteria table.  Nothing moved.  I was jello.  She was a little too intelligent to arouse me.  I was
tuned on by the anamalistic.  I didn't want to be swapping spit with an intellect.  But maybe if we
were in bed together naked?

     "Jonathan, I've been looking for you," Tracie said as she interrupted us, chewing gum.  I'm
not sure I minded.  If I fell in love with Amy, she might steal my soul.  I'd become a zombie.

     "Tracie, this is Amy.  Amy, this is Tracie," I said.

     "Jonathan, did you forget?"

     "What?"

     "We're having a picnic.  I have the lunches right here," she said and held up a large plastic
bag.

     "You think I'd forget that?"  I had forgotten.

     We brushed the late spring snow off a bench near the Central Park zoo and opened the
lunches.  We had Westphallian ham sandwiches and swiss cheese on black bread; gerkins, cole
slaw and a few small tomatos.  In the cool air the tomatos tasted like they had just come out of
the refrigerator.  They were fresh as an icicle.  An elephant came out of a building, raised his
trunk above his head, roared and took a dump.  Steam rose from his shit like an exclamation
mark.  Then he walked back inside.

     Tracie looked at me cross-eyed like she was overwhelmed with love and sang her favorite
song, "I Want to Hold Your Hand."  She sounded exactly like Paul McCartney.  It was amazing
how she could transform her girlish voice into a Liverpudlian male's.  She reached out and
grabbed my hand, acting out the song.  It was so hokey that I blushed, so childish that I liked it.

     "We ought to get married," she said.

     I hugged her.  I hid behind her shoulder.  Why would I want to marry her when I was banging
her for free?

     "We're too young," I said.

     "My sister got married at seventeen."

     "But her husband was forty-two," I said.  That was disgusting.  I hoped Tracie didn't fall for
some old sleeze after I dumped her.

     "I can't wait forever.  Better marry me soon or I'm going to start dating."

     I remembered a few months ago when I thought we were getting too involved.  I suggested
we start dating.  One evening I ran into her at Max's Kansas City dancing with Thurston Muddle.
He was the only nerd there with a suit and tie.  Everyone else was freaked out in velvet clothes
and boots, tripping on acid, dancing to the Doors.  It was a typical sixties scene.  No way she
could have liked Thurston.  I told her no more dating.

     "Alright, I'll marry you," I said.  I could always back out later.  What was the difference?   At
least this would stop her from screwing someone else.

     "He proposed to me.  He proposed," she started screaming and crying to the elephant who
had come back to wrestle with another turd.  The elephant let out a roar.  And a fart.  The smell
traveled across the sidewalk to where we were sitting on the bench.  We both gathered our stuff
and skiddadled.

     I took Tracie back to my apratment and made love to her under my mother's bed.  It was a
raised bed so we were able to screw on the floor under it.  There was something nice about doing
it there.  I felt closer to my parents.  Like I was revisiting the birth scene.  My mother and brother
never came home in the afternoon.  It was safe.

     My brother did't even ring the bell.  He just barged in, with his receptionist, Sherry, a big fat
black woman in her fifties.  I recognized their voices when he entered my mother's room and lay
on the bed with her.  I guess he liked the primal scene too.  The bed slunk down and pressed
against us.

     "Play dead, big mama," he told Sherry.

     "I'm dead," she said.

     "Are you sure?"

     "Really dead."

     "Good,"  There was a silence.  Then I heard a slap, "Don't touch me.  You dirty necrophiliac."

     "Say it again," my brother said.  I could hear him rubbing himself.

     "You dirty necrophiliac."

     "One more time."

     "You dirty necrophiliac."

     The bed shook.  A heavy sigh.  My brother said, "I came."

     "Congratulations," Sherry said.

     When they left, the bed raised two inches.  Tracie kissed me, saying, "My husband.  I love the
word husband.  I'm going to be Mrs. Tracie Finkelstein.  You're brother seems very nice.."

     The next day at art class I spoke to Amy.  "I told Tracie I might marry her."

     "She'll make you dress like the Beatles."

     "I love you.  I think."

     "I might love you too.  I think, " she said, and broke out a tootsie roll and started chewing it
with her mouth open.  "We're soul mates and our spirits are love's cosmic voyagers," she said,
her voice stuttering through the sticky chocolate.

     "We should see if the sex is good."

     "We owe it to ourselves."

     "It's a debt to true love."

     "An obligation."

     "I’ll marry you if it works," I said.

     I didn't want to take Amy to my home.  I had too many memories of other women, particularly
Tracie, to take her there.  I wanted to take her to a place that really meant something to me.  A
place that made me ponder the meaning of life.  I decided to take her to the Finkelstein Funderal
Home on Madison Avenue.

     We found a beautiful, sleek mahogany coffin.  Very expensive.  Lined in lavender satin, it
was scheduled to be the final resting place for Mrs. Gladis Zuckerman,.  Gladis was in the
refrigerator, waiting to be laid out.

     We took off our clothes and got into her coffin, laying down sideways.  Amy had a bit of an
odor like she was already dead.  I guess she didn't bathe too well.  That shouldn't matter though.
I was after her cosmic mind not her body.  I could always buy her some perfume.

     "When I was a kid I spent many nights lying in coffins thinking about the meaning of life," I
said.

     "This is a very weighty place."

     "You feel grounded."

     "I never felt so at peace.  I think dying is going to be great.  My soul is going to set forth in a
flying saucer."

     We hugged each other naked and I would have gotten an erection but she picked her nose
and shot it.  I wanted to tell her that that wasn't polite.  But I didn't think it was polite to say that.  I
tried to tell myself that I had just imagined she picked her nose.  But I could see the boogie
hanging off the coffin next to us.

     "I want to paint the world with your colors," she said and reached down and grabbed my dick.
It was embarrassingly soft and had shrunken to the root.  I tried to kiss her, thinking I'd get
aroused, but her breath stank and I gagged.

     "What's wrong?" she asked.

     I should have told her right then and there that she was a slob.  I should have taken her in the
back room where they washed down the corpses and scrubbed her.  Made her clean as her
intelligence.  Then I could have thmbed through her like the pages of the Bible; intercoursed her
pubic wisdom.  But I couldn't do it.  I couldn't hurt her feelings.

     "I'm beginning to think of you more as a friend than a love," I said.

     "It's the delemma of the existentialist to be trapped by his yearnings rather than his spiritual
consciousness," she said.

     "It's my soft penis," I said.

     "I can't marry a softee."

     "Maybe it will get hard."

     "I'm afraid we're not radioactive."

     "What do you mean?"

     "Your penis is the test.  It's a geiger counter.  It didn't register.  We're just not meant for each
other."

     "We could have been so perfect together."

     "We can still be friends," she said.  "You can cheat on Tracie with me."

     "But the sex isn't htere."

     "We don't need sex."

     "Then what?"

     "We'll have good conversation."

     "That's not cheating."

     "It is."

     "How?"

     "She'll have your body.  I'll have your soul," she said and burbed in my face.  I threw up and it
took me almost a half an hour to clean up Mrs. Gladis Zuckerman's casket.  I sprayed it with
Lysol so as not to infect the corpse.  I wanted to let the old lady lie in germ-free peace.

     After that evening my talks with Amy just weren't the same.  The spirituality of our
relationship had been stained by our junket to the funeral home.  The corpoereal had pinched our
cosmic affection and bruised it.  The odor of death hung around us and I was haunted by the
vision of her naked in a coffin, belching in my face.  So we began to drift apart like we had been
through detox.  And I became more hooked on Tracie.

     Tracie and I finally got officially engaged.  I put a five caret diamond ring on her finger when
we were in my father's hot tub.  It down the drain and it cost me a thousand dollars to get a
plumber to open up the piping and get it back.

     Even though our conversations revolved around the Beatles, fashion and nonsense, I found
her fresh as a bar of soap and was captivated by her.  She had an inner glow that effused from
her like laughing gas in a dentist's office.  I was high around her.  My gums felt good and my
molars grew.  My dick was straight as a drill.

     I did a two year tour in Vietnam.  Based on my family experience I was assigned to putting
dead soldiers in body bags.  I felt right at home doing this.  Sometimes at night I'd creep into
empty body bags with Vietnamese hookers.  Once I found a toe in there.  I used it to tickle a
teenage whore.

     Because I didn't speak Vietnamese I found the girls even more exciting.  The complete lack
of understanding was titillating.  Their squeaky, high-pitched rapid fire chatter was as good as
foreplay.  I felt like I was screwing idiots.  I felft like I was screwing Tracie.

     I told our major that I was responsible for bagging five thousand dead soldiers.  Who cared if
they were Americans?  i got a medal and came home a hero.  My father was out of jail and back
running the family funeral parlor business.  He bought the house back in East Hampton.  And the
yacht.  He drowned another polo pony and mounted it, putting it in the foyer to match the one we
had in the city.

     I developed this fetish where I liked to make love to Tracie on the stairwell in the
Metropolotan Museum of Art.  She broke off our engagement, saying, "I would have preferred
the Museum of Modern Art."

     I said, "I don't have a membership card."

     "You don't give good conversation.  You don't like to talk about fashion and things," she said.

     I cried.  I loved the sex with her and the bubble of nonsense that surrounded her like soap.  I
particularly liked how wrong she was for me.  It was thrilling.

     A year later I married her.

     Amy moved to California and wrote to me: "I've fallen in with a group of very profound
revolutionaries.  I'm living off the land.  I found communal love.  My brothers and sisters are all
very natural and they walk around naked.  I don't bathe.  I feel like an animal.  Isn't that great?
You'd love the leader of the commune.  He is a short guy with long hair and a beard.  He sees
deep meaning in simple things.  He's a lot like you.  And he's been in jail like your dad.  He says
if you love someone you should kill for that person.  That's real committment.  He finds
messages encoded in music;  he told me that the Beatles speak to him.  Tracie would like that.
She was always a big fan.  I did a painting of him where he looks like a cross between, Jesus
Christ, Paul McCartney and Adolph Hitler.  I think he's going to be famous one day.  I spoke to
him about you and if you came out you two could have some really good conversation.  He's a
grety guy.  His name's Charlie."

That is an example of unpuctuated Latin which Umberto Eco forewarded to me
for comment (he's considering writing a totally new kind of novel (or "poem"
the Italians dont differentiate I've discovered from my local Pizza
Ristorante, but that's another divertimento.....)...actually I...
as he is thinking of doing a sequel to "The Name of the Rose"  but was
running out of grammatical and semiotic or other related arcana...in fact
the novel is to be entirely written in punctuation marks: (imagine!)an
enormously brilliant and fulmigationous departure which he feels will kind
of "clinch" his lit. carreer...he confides that only stupid people want
"meaning" (he almost spat that out (if you do meet old Umb have  go at
getting him going on about meaning and all that kind of stuff.))...actually
this is the sort of thing that kind of "proves our" (rather nebulous)
"point" (punctus? punctus nobilis insidiosus?) re poetry/prose and my claims
for the dictionary as being a
poem...which owing to my mispellings appearing to "take the Mickey" caused
or gave cause  for a person to become troubled (or to troubled their self)
("troublus doublus" as they say) that it was that person whom
I was derising but  nay!...really I was having fun which leads back to the
whole
question of launguage and communication and the net...problems of the fact
that  - as we neither hear nor see each other - we occupy a rather strange
and almost inhuman area of soundless speech and near inhuman talking....we
may actually, in net communicata, or incommunicata latina magna seriosa
morbida,  actually be experiencing what it is like
to be blind: in fact, quite seriously, (I'll de-humoresque at this punctus),
a number of those on the list could
be so. But even communicating to a blind person (and I acknowledge I have
difficulty with this...I have one very good friend ((young man) who is blind
and much as I like him his actual presence disturbs me)) (the old fear of
"strangeness"?Eh?)...I just have to see
another person's face...and I read (and someone else noted) that St
Augustine was amazed to find a friend reading a book without using his lips,
(I dont mean that the old latin guys used to actually "eat their words",
that WOULD be going too far (as in the Barthelme story))..........
or silently...I think that the impulse to speak is almost overwhelming,or, I
should say, the urge to "sound"  the words...I'm not alone probably in
wanting to read from novels (or poems) aloud...which I do a lot or stop and
write something out ...its interesting the way we assume punctuation &
grammar (puntus grammaticus)
etc as  "set in stone" until we think about it...the very word "colon" could
make some people ill...but that's the polysemantic nature of our polyhilic
and non-polyphemic language, our lingual and psycho-lingual planet that's
like an enormous and tormented brain of burning seething dreams and semes
and semantic intagliations......etc etc....
I did Latin up to sixth form locally and wish to hell I had continued with
Latin Greek languages (as well as other things) as I regret (another of
those "carefully caught regrets"!) not having the kind of erudition eg
Eliot had (but I dont regret being as miserable as E apparently was)...I
have a rather (absurd?) desire to read "everything" but I keep moving from
book to unfinished book...but to get back to the topos..by the way I lost my
Short (huge Latin Dictionary) circa 1965, should I steal another to kind of
compensate?...just a thought......of course my posts
have mostly been a touch humoresque but in this I'm signalling (there's that
word) back to Eco and his monks and the supression of humour..which Joyce
more or less "corrected" and maybe writers like
Doctorow,Barthelme,Heller,Brautigan,Eco himself,and Italo Calvino have
somwhat redressed...humour being underrated in its deep value...its
renewwing
and rejuvenating power..."laughter is the best medicine" is not
coincidentally a very old phrase...maybe (of the poets) Ted Berrigan and
often Frank O'Hara and even (wash me mouth...) Betjemann or Selima Hill...to
take some totally disparate and irrelevat and unrelated examples to
elucidate whatever I was rambling on about......
has that marvellous joie de vie (or is that de vivre?) so this cyberspace
that some writers are obsessed with (I dont mean that derogatively it is an
interesting and quite new development and must bring or stimulate new ways
of tormenting oneself and possibly (or hopefully?) others..after all..how
did old Ash's poem go: "That grew into something monstrous, with all that
useless love inclosed in titanuim towers whose sneer holocausts into the
tapering evening that so long silent had nothing further to add unless that
sigh like a vagrant bubble quiver into the  misspent and irridescent
afternoon (spent dans la interieur de la fume) could rise only to cloud in
pyjama silencio whose mustachio was punctilio hey presto!"?) .....but
anycase, forgewt all that,  the whole matter's academic: fascinating but
ultimately, sub speciae aeternitatis, futile...but, indeed, futility whose
very "neant" is its power, its raison d'etre...but these issues are very
cogent notwithstanding and I thank Aaron for his kind appellations..indeed
the issue raises further matters of...
spelling puctuation grammar meaning communication ideation signalling
comprehension bafflement fear desire wonder power insidious penetration
clinical and linguistic detachment and delusions and dreams and a myriad

Announcing the latest volume in the series Modern and Contemporary
Poetics, edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank Lazer

Everybody's Autonomy
Connective Reading and Collective Identity
Juliana Spahr

Everybody's Autonomy is about reading and identity.

Contemporary avant garde writing has often been overlooked by those who
study literature and identity. Such writing has been perceived as
unrelated, as disrespectful of subjectivity. But Everybody's Autonomy
instead locates within avant garde literature models of identity that
are communal, connective, and racially concerned.

Everybody's Autonomy, as it tackles literary criticism's central
question of what sort of selves do works create, looks at works that
encourage connection, works that present and engage with large, public
worlds that are in turn shared with readers. With this intent, it aligns
the iconoclastic work of Gertrude Stein with foreign, immigrant
Englishes and their accompanying subjectivities. It examines the
critique of white individualism and privilege in the work of language
writers Lyn Hejinian and Bruce Andrews. It looks at how Harryette Mullen
mixes language writing's open text with the distinctiveness of
African-American culture to propose a communal, yet still
racially-conscious identity. And it examines Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's use
of broken English and French to unsettle readers' fluencies and
assimilating comprehensions, to decolonize reading. Such works, the book
argues, well represent and expand changing notions of the public, of
everybody.


Juliana Spahr is Assistant Professor of English at the University of
Hawai'i, Manoa.

"Juliana Spahr's remarkable poetic mind is the refractive prism of her
useful and inspiring criticism. This book makes a strong case for the
long-standing American tradition of reading as a form of liberation, but
it makes it in terms appropriate to Spahr's vision of a utopian
democracy of active readers in today's complex cultural environments.
Her engagements with Stein, Hejinian, Andrews, Mullen, and Cha enact an
informed self-invention of meaning that is both richly nuanced model of
agency and constructive affirmation for our inextricably intertwined
poly-ethnic-racial-lingual world."                      -Joan Retallack, Bard College

Hello,

This sounds particularly interesting, but as I live in New Zealand it seems
unlikely that $0.55 (particularly in $NZ) will cover the costs of postage.
If you could send a pricing for postage to NZ (an estimate is fine) I will
happily send the $.

Yours,
Michael Onslow-Osborne

This week and next week at the Poetry Project:

Wednesday, February 7th at 8 pm
TODD COLBY AND JAYNE CORTEZ
Among Todd Colby=B9s books are Ripsnort (1994) and Charm Factory: New and
Selected Writings (1999). He edited Heights of the Marvelous: A New York
Anthology (St. Martin=B9s, 2000). Mr. Colby was the lead singer for the
now-defunct band Drunken Boat and has taught several writing workshops at
the Poetry Project. His poems are pop, dada, grunge, comic, romantic, and
personal. In performance they have been known to explode; on the page they
vibrate. Jayne Cortez was born in Arizona, grew up in California, and lives
in New York. Her ten collections of poetry include Somewhere in Advance of
Nowhere, Mouth on Paper, and Congratulations, and with her band, the
Firespitters, she has recorded six CD=B9s. Her voice is celebrated for its
political, surrealistic, dynamic innovations in lyricism.

Friday, February 9th at 10:30 pm
WHAT WILL I SAY NEXT? A NIGHT OF IMPROVISATIONAL POETRY
Poets Jen Abrams and Matthew Courtney will perform their improvisational

Wednesday, February 14th at 8 pm
RICHARD HELL AND VINCENT KATZ
Richard Hell became famous in the mid-seventies as an originator of the pun=
k
movement. His album Blank Generation (1977) by "Richard Hell and the
Voidoids" was chosen by the New York Times as one of the ten best albums of
the decade. Mr. Hell is the author of four books of poems and a short novel=
,
The Voidoid, that he wrote in 1973. In the late 80s he edited the literary
magazine CUZ for The Poetry Project. His first full-length novel, Go Now,
was published by Scribner in 1996 to excellent reviews. Vincent Katz=B9s new
collection of poetry, Understanding Objects, recently appeared from Hard
Press. A poet, translator and critic, Mr. Katz has published collaborative
books with several artists, including two with the late Rudy Burckhardt. In
1995, he published Charm, a translation from Latin of the first book of
poems by Sextus Propertius. Mr. Katz is currently translating the remaining
poems of Propertius.

Friday, February 16th at 10:30 pm

of countless recurrence that we may reach a genuine volition, willing eternal
recurrence. Hence Nietzsche's philosophy could be a philosophy of the will

a prerequisite of the will, and since according to Heidegger our epoch is

will play a very important role in modern philosophy.'"

nikuko wants to know, what does it mean that 'man is the measure of all
things'? nikuko wants to know, what does it mean to 'know thyself'?

'we do not speak of the gender of 'man' above; we want to say: 'one is the
measure of all things.' surely for one that is true. theory absolves pers-
onal history and taste: i do such and such, believe such and such, within
the realm of digital explanation; mute, abject, analog description has no
place in the world of discourse. it is description that thickens at every
turn of the mind or body, always already resisting measure and measure-
ment. knowledge, too, is imminent, implicit in the intended gaze; nothing
is foresaken, forlorn; something is defined by virtue of the gaze itself.
so we would say, not state; talk, not speak; thus to the unfathomability
of knowledge.'

 Below three emails from Day2/WashTech, the union attempting to orginize
 Amazon - those Seattle workers who were first hired - and first fired,
 including a sample letter you can send to Amazon.   (geert)

 For more information:

 http://www.washtech.org/day2/020801_deadline.php


 ----------------------------------------------

 (1)
 Dear Day2/WashTech Supporter,

 We are Amazon.com Customer Service employees in Seattle who have been
 working to organize a union called Day 2 - affiliated with
 WashTech/CWA.  As you may have heard, the majority of us were informed
 on Tuesday, January 30, that the Seattle customer service center will be
 closing in May and that our jobs will cease to exist.

 We want to make it clear that Day 2 is not finished organizing.
 Specifically, we are concerned by a "Separation Agreement and General
 Release" contract that we have been required to sign in exchange for an
 "Enhanced Severance Package" when we leave in May.  If we don't sign
 this agreement by February 9, 2001, we will receive a drastically
 reduced package.

 While Amazon has removed a non-disparagement clause from the contract,
 there are several other points of concern in this separation agreement
 regarding basic workers' rights and the right to organize.  Certain
 sections are also in violation of the National Labor Relations Act
 (NLRA).

 We are asking as many people as possible to send an email to
 orders@amazon.com including either the message below or a modified
 version of it.

 Lastly, we want to thank you for your amazing support during this union
 drive.  Your words of encouragement have been invaluable in keeping our
 spirits up and strengthening our resolve in the face of an anti-union
 campaign on the part of Amazon management.

 Thank you for your continued support,
 Day2
 WashTech/CWA

 ***Sample Letter***

 Dear Amazon,

 It has come to my attention that you are asking your laid-off customer
 service employees to sign a "Separation Agreement and General Release"
 by February 9, 2001, as a condition of receiving their full severance
 package.

 While Amazon has removed a non-disparagement clause from the contract,
 there are several other points of concern in this separation agreement
 regarding basic workers' rights and the right to organize.

 Particularly, sections of this contract restrict these employees' right
 to file any existing and future claims against the company.  Rrequiring
 these workers to sign this contract before their end date is illegal as
 it violates subsections 8 (a)(1), (4) and (5) of the National Labor
 Relations Act.   Amazon should not force laid off workers to choose
 between their severance package and their rights.

 Sincerely,

 ----------------------------------------------

 Dear Day2 - WashTech/CWA Supporter,

 We have won a small but very significant victory today!  Yesterday we
 wrote you and asked that you email Amazon.com about the "separation
 agreements" that laid off employees were asked to sign by this Friday,
 February 9.  Due to your numerous letters to the company and our
 internal organizing efforts, Amazon.com has decided to extend our
 deadline to the last day of our employment.

 While we still have concerns about this agreement, we are pleased that
 so many people have shown their support through letters and e-mails.  We
 are continuing to organize around specific clauses of the agreement -
 particularly those that require that we give up our rights in exchange
 for the severance package we deserve.  We encourage everyone to continue
 to watch our efforts at http://www.washtech.org/day2 .

 Thanks to continued support from CWA and WashTech, we continue to build
 power for ourselves through Day 2.  Please check out the statement we
 are releasing about this victory below...

 In solidarity,

 The Day 2 Organizing Committee
 WashTech/CWA

 ********************************

 Day 2 Statement on Extending the Deadline

 Earlier today, Amazon.com announced that they would no longer be
 requiring laid-off Customer Service employees here in Seattle to return
 their signed Separation Agreement by February 9.  We now have until our
 date of termination, either May 4 or May 25, to sign and return this
 document. Needless to say, we feel that this is a step in the right
 direction, won by our continued and organized efforts. We are all
 breathing a collective sigh of relief. We are no longer being pressured
 into choosing between our rights and our full severance package with
 such short notice.

 We would like to thank Amazon.com for their continued good will and
 willingness to listen to our concerns.  Nonetheless, we do have
 additional concerns, which we hope will be addressed:

 1)  Many employees have already signed and returned their Separation
 Agreements.  Although Amazon.com has stated that they will return the
 signed agreements to any employees who request that they do so, we feel
 that, as this announcement came so close to the now nullified deadline,
 Amazon.com should return *all* previously signed agreements to its
 employees.  This will give all laid-off employees the chance to continue
 to seek legal counsel before returning the agreement, regardless of
 whether they have already returned the agreement.

 2)  In said Separation Agreement, there are still two clauses that would
 require us to eliminate our rights.  These are clauses #10 and 11, the
 General Representation General Release by employee clauses, which ask us
 to sign away our rights to pursue action against the company for legal
 or compensatory reasons.  We ask that these clauses be removed entirely.

 3)  We would still like to request that Amazon.com make the enhanced
 severance package available to any laid-off employee who chooses to
 leave their employ before their official date of termination.

 Upon consideration of these three demands, we ask Amazon.com management
 to rescind the separation agreement all-together and to simply provide
 us with the Enhanced Severance Packages in respect of our dedication and
 service to the company.

 Again, we do appreciate the company's willingness to work with its
 employees in these trying times, and look forward to continued good will
 between Amazon.com and its laid-off employees.

 AMAZON.COM EXTENDS DEADLINE ON SEPARATION AGREEMENT FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE
 EMPLOYEES

 (Seattle, WA) Amazon.com will give laid off hourly customer service orkers
 until May to decide if they want to sign a controversial separation
 agreement in exchange for an Enhanced Severance Package of 10 weeks
 additional pay plus $500.   While the company had originally given laid-off
 workers, who ill continue to work at the company through May, a deadline of
 Friday, February 9, to sign the agreement, the company announced in a
 department wide e-mail today that the deadline has been extended to the
 employees' termination date. The announcement comes two days after 50
 customer service employes in Seatte staged a 15-minute walkout protesting
 the companys layoffs and the separation agreement.

A special evening with Vancouver poets
GEORGE STANLEY & SHARON THESEN

Thursday February 8
7:30 pm, $5 donation
@ The Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

San Francisco native GEORGE STANLEY makes a rare return visit to his home
town for The Poetry Center's opening evening of its Spring 2001 series.  A
member of the poetry circles around the late Jack Spicer and the North
Beach bohemian scene during the 1960s, Mr. Stanley had his early books
published here by the legendary White Rabbit Press.  Some of his finest
later poems are centered on his personal and family history in San
=46rancisco.  His amazing long poem "San Francisco's Gone" (in the recent
book Gentle Northern Summer) is the most remarkable San Francisco poem to
appear within anyone's recent memory.  Since 1970 George Stanley has made
his home in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he teaches at Capilano
College.  His recent books, published by New Star Books of Vancouver,
include the brilliant volume Gentle Northern Summer and, just out, that
book's equally compelling successor, At Andy's.

SHARON THESEN is one of Canada's more prominent poets and editors.  Recent
projects include her edition of The New Long Poem Anthology (Coach House
Press, Toronto; new edition forthcoming from Talonbooks), and, co-edited
with scholar Ralph Maud, the incredibly illuminating correspondence between
the remarkable writer Frances Boldereff and the late great poet Charles
Olson-- Charles Olson and Frances Boldereff:  A Modern Correspondence
(Wesleyan University Press, 1999).  Ms. Thesen's books of poetry include
Artemis Hates Romance, Aurora (both from Coach House), News and Smoke
(Talonbooks, 1999) and, most recent, A Pair of Scissors (Anansi, 2000).
She too teaches at Capilano College in Vancouver.

VERACRUZ


In Veracruz, city of breezes & sailors & loud birds,
an old man, I walked the Malec=F3n by the sea,

and I thought of my father, who when a young man
had walked the Malec=F3n in Havana, dreaming of Brazil,

and I wished he had gone to Brazil
& learned magic,

and I wished my father had come back to San Francisco
armed with Brazilian magic, & that he had married
not my mother, but her brother, whom he truly loved.

I wish my father had, like Tiresias, changed himself into a woman,
& that he had been impregnated by my uncle, & given birth to me as a girl.

I wish that I had grown up in San Francisco as a girl,
a tall, serious girl,

& that eventually I had come to Veracruz,
& walking on the Malec=F3n, I had met a sailor,
a Mexican sailor or a sailor from some other country--
        maybe a Brazilian sailor,
& that he had married me, & I had become pregnant by him,
so that I could give birth at last to my son--the boy I love.

~George Stanley
from At Andy's (New Star Books, =A9 George Stanley 2000)

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

about George Stanley:
"The reality that Stanley experiences is so demanding that the poems
simultaneously track the experience of the world he's in, the startling
play of his mind, and his recurrent, shifting insights about language,
which is inseparable from the world."

about Sharon Thesen:
"The scissors of the title snip through unexpected corners of the world.
Like Stanley's, Thesen's poems are animated by an unusually powerful
intelligence.  They typically begin with a mundane moment . . . but before
even a brief poem is over, it cuts into the often ominous, quirky, reality
below. . . .  Thesen's poems are insistently in the same world as the rest
of us."

The Williams article, by Bill Buford, was in the  Jun 5, 2000 issue of the
New Yorker. Stanford's death was the inspiration for a couple of her songs,
including "Sweet Old World," one of her most moving. Until I read the
article, I had no idea that C.D. Wright had also had a relationship with
Stanford. Interesting stuff.

For those interested in gossip...why not just listen to the Jad Fair
tune..."Tongues Wag in This Town."...

It's the difference between "Third Watch" where everything's a
soap-opera...and "Law and Order" where everything's just a police
procedural...give us details of beautiful mechanisms driving the new poetry
... not satin-sheet hopping whatever...

Best,
Gerald

Dear Friends,

It's been a strange past few months. Moved into a great new space and
then began losing critical things. First my fat address book (not
email), and two weeks ago my apartment was burgled and my computer was
stolen. Everything from the past two years including all my Belladonna
communications. If you get this message and would like to be on the soon
to be reconstructed list, do send a little email to
Levitsk@attglobal.net, with your name and email address. Thank you for
your support.  I look forward to seeing you soon at one of the events
below or yet another.

Happy February,

Rachel Levitsky

from ed-
yanni's band, and my band are playing a show together on feb. 17th @
the fun rama house in west philly. if you're interested in coming, let me
know - i'll get you the details!

ps - here's some information at that show with albatross and stinking liz:

>* STINKING LIZAVETA
>* AN ALBATROSS
>* THE SOUND OF FAILURE
 >* CAP'N CRASH
>* JAMES LOVE JACKSON


ed is in "an albatross", a great band/performance art piece not to be
missed....they interact with the audience and that's all i'll say without
giving the surprises away, it is hypnotic....yanni is in stinking lizaveta,
one of philly's best bands...they rock...yanni's guitar has a distinctive
eastern european sound, but sort of jimi hendrix style.
by the way, "stinking lizaveta" was a character in a dostoyevsky novel.
the show costs a measly $3 and starts at 6:30 pm, 4103 baltimore ave., sat.,

6. no more sundance movie theater at 40th and walnut st.?


robert redford's sundance movie theaters are said to be bankrupt...they were
in the middle of building a movie theater at 40th and walnut st. we will see
what happens there. apparently, he was building many of these theaters around
the country, and they were nice, but expensive, and well, he ran out of money
before any of them opened.

7. no more sega dreamcast

good luck getting any cool games for your 'paperweight' in the future. the

the playstation 2 which is out now.

____________________________________________________________

8. use of the letter X, X-games, XFL football, Xm radio, X box.....

note: post milennial use of the letter X.
the X box is the new video game system.....then there's the X games which are
coming to philadelphia by the way, extreme sports,
and then there's xmsr, a company launching xm sattelite radio....you heard of
am, and fm, well, now there will be xm....there will be special xm radios in
cars that will be able to pick up 100 stations, wherever you are in the usa,

Saturday, February 10, 7pm, Antigone, 411 N 4th Ave,

Suggested Contribution: $5; Students $3

“The process of the poem, the performance of it I mentioned, is central to
the impression I have that life is a rehearsal for the poem, or the final
moment of spiritual revelation.”
-- Eileen Myles  “How I Wrote Certain of my Poems,” Not Me (1991,
Semiotext[e])

Eileen Myles was born in Cambridge, Mass. in 1949, was educated in Catholic
schools, and graduated from U. Mass. (Boston) in 1971. She moved to New York
in 1974 to be a poet. She gave her first reading at CBGB’s and then
gravitated to St. Mark’s Church where she studied with Paul Violi, Alice
Notley and Ted Berrigan. She edited a poetry magazine, dodgems, in 1977-79.
She ran the Saint Mark’s Poetry Project in 1984-86. She’s written several
plays: Feeling Blue, Parts 1, 2 & 3, Modern Art, and Our Sor Juana. Earlier
books of poems are Fresh Young Voice from the Plains  (New York : Power Mad
Press, 1981), Bread and Water  (Madras & New York : Hanuman Books), and Not
Me (New York : Semiotext[e], 1991).   Recently, Black Sparrow Press has
published her book of short stories Chelsea Girls (1994) and two books of
poems, Maxfield Parrish (1995) and School of Fish (1997).  She ran for
President of the United States in 1992.

Myles’ most recent book is the novel Cool for You (New York: Soft Skull
Press, 2000).  Dennis Cooper describes Myles as “one of the savviest voices
and most restless intellects in contemporary lit.”

For immediate release

Ink Paintings by Max Gimblett

Poems in Ink by John Yau and Max Gimblett

at Ethan Cohen Fine Arts


Max Gimblett's Ink Paintings follow a journey of the self. With

spontaneous gesture, Gimblett marks the surface of canvas, gilded wood

panels, and paper.  He is inspired by life-long studies of calligraphy and

his travels to India, Japan, Cambodia, and Burma. He draws with sumi ink,

vinyl and acrylic polymers. His motifs include the enso (circle), triangle

(self/sail), double square (book), skull, hand, prayer bell, and cauldron.

Gimblett's work also engages the history of international contemporary art,

particularly abstract expressionism.  These works are part of an ongoing

project that spans forty years.


Gimblett's exhibition follows C.C. Wang's innovative ink painting

exhibition at Ethan Cohen Fine Arts last year. Wang's exhibition bridged the

tradition of classical Chinese painting and contemporary American art.

Gimblett's Ink Paintings cross the bridge from the other side. Born in New

Zealand, Gimblett came to the United States in 1964. A child of the South

Pacific and formed artistically in the sixties in America, Gimblett

considers

his true teacher to be Sengai Gibon, the eighteenth-century Japanese master.


Accompanying the exhibition of Ink Paintings is Poems in Ink, a

collaboration between poet John Yau and Max Gimblett, in the Annex.

Self-identified as "Elves in the Factory of Art and Life," they have been

creating a stunning range of one-of-a-kind books since 1992. Their

collaborations include secret manuals of the doctrines of love, Koans,

children's stories, a family album, a non-linear novel, and diaries of dada

and orphic figures. As Yau explains, "our research is directed towards

ecstatic states of being, flights of mind and eye through the storms of

thinking and being. Image and language dance around each other, with each

other, and through each other. No one is boss, and everything is."  They

are,

in his words, "alchemists working on a long-term project."


"What is the source of vanity's wish? To be brighter than all the rest."

John Yau's poems, in the tradition of Zen Koan, respond to Gimblett's

drawings. As Yau explains, "The point is to push the words and mark, image

and gesture through each other until something explodes in the air of its

friction."  Artist and poet can be seen working and reflecting on their

collaboration in a video in the exhibition.


This exhibition is the occasion for releasing their limited edition book,

Double-Headed Creature Features, created with Tobin Hines. The book was

published in an edition of fifty by Makeshift Press in Atlanta.

Max Gimblett has recently exhibited at Haines Gallery (San Francisco) and

Margaret Thatcher Projects (New York). Kevin Bruk Gallery (Miami) also

represents Gimblett's work.  In July 2001, he will exhibit at the Gow,

Langsford Gallery (Auckland). An exhibition devoted to his works on paper

will open at the Queensland Art Gallery (Brisbane) in 2002. A book about his

work, will be issued by Craig Potten Publishing (Nelson) in 2002 and will

include essays by Wystan Curnow and John Yau.


John Yau is a prize winning poet and critic. For more than two decades,

he has published poetry and fiction, as well as reviews and essays on

contemporary art, both nationally and internationally. He has curated

exhibitions for major museums and alternative spaces. He is one of the few

contemporary poets to collaborate extensively with artists, who include Ed

Paschke, Robert Therrien, Archie Rand, Pat Steir, Suzanne McClelland, Norman

Bluhm, and Jurgen Partenheimer.


Ethan Cohen Fine Arts is located at 37 Walker Street, New York, NY 10013.

The exhibition will run from February 15 to March 10, 2001. The opening is

on

February 15, from 6-8 PM. Gallery hours are Tuesday-Friday, 12-6; Saturday

11-4, and by appointment.

To bad we didn't get this in December, but I thought it would make as good
an offering for Easter.

Solipsis says:

Born and raised in the oil-smudged tar-fields of northern texas, I was a
poor and innocent songster of glee.. One day I was given a powerful and
unknown agent which tranformed me into the powerful and shamanistic
word-beast I have become today.. GREAT SKULL ZERO; dark, strange, like a
black velvet centipede bursting from the eyesocket of Elvis. I published my
new screams in an underground zine for several years called _The Toenail
Gazook_, then was latter captured by film-maker Gus Van Sant who put my
words into his novel _Pink_. I can now be reached exclusively at

Sydney, Australia Sunday 11th February
Dear Poetics listees -
The "overland" editor, Ian Syson, has asked me to post
this great offer...As the poetry editor, I'd recommend
that you get a copy of Issue 154 - a special issue on
4 poets - John Forbes, Adam Aitken, Coral Hull and
Judith Wright plus essays by Gig Ryan, Martin Duwell,
John Kinsella and an interview with Adam Aitken by
Ouyang Yu, plus reviews & terrific poems. Each issue
for the past 5 or so years has great poetry and the
more recent issues have Kerry Leves' form guide to the
latest Australian poetry publications. "Overland" is
the only  radical literary magazine in Australia. The
back issues are available very cheaply (& the Aussie $
is down to 53cents U.S.) - just phone
the office or email - see the foot of Ian's message.
Thanks everyone
Pam Brown

Hello all (and sorry for double posting to some),

Overland has a space crisis and we are now looking to
offload a number
of back issues. We have full runs (well almost full)
and will be happy
to sell them at a low price. If you want just a few
issues to complete
your set, we might be able to help there as well. I'd
be broken-hearted
at the thought of having to pulp perfectly good back
issues -- so get
in
while you can. Some issues are particularly well
stocked -- those of
you
who are teachers might be interested in very cheap
class sets of these
or whatever.

All the best

I find it difficult to believe that Umberto, as well versed as he is in
theory, meant this as it is written.  Perhaps he was referring to the MEANING
some still insist occupies some absolute ground, since Umberto, as well as
anyone, knows there is no escape from meaning.  Come to think of it, there's
no escape from stupidity either.  On a third hand, his Misreadings is a
little masterpiece, and one of the funniest books I've ever had the pleasure
to eat.  I recommend it to anyone who, like myself, enjoys theory but still
maintains a sense of humor about it all.  Best, Bill

world


(what i stumble towards)
(what i have wanted to describe)
(what is indescribable)
(the tendency of my work)
(what characterizes philosophy: "philosophy has no regard")

the thickness of the world
the idiocy of the real
when there is death, the interior of a world disappears
there are details, one can see this in any past
the smell of a kitchen, the paint on the edges of the chairs
do the chairs need repainting
certain parts of the backs are worn, he sits there, she here
there's a sound they make, different sounds, pulled in and out
the dulled reflection of the chairs on the floor
when they were new
when they began to disappear, the last memory of the chairs
the light on them from the window, sounds of rain on the window
how high the backs above the table, their reflection on the table
the food, when the family may have been together
familiality, familiarity
when the chairs were comfortable, when they were turned
when we turned them facing one another, or moved them aside
when one of us left the room and the chairs were moved
fly in the window's interior
from the chair, tree outside, smaller then, different neighbors
sounds from the street coming in

the limitlessness of the world, its thickness
over and over again, peering around the corner
there is the world in uncanny, unaccountable, fullness

there is no theory for this, this inaccessible description
every explanation, there are heuristics, things glossed over
not the things of the world, but their fallen worlds
all worlds are fallen for that matter
all worlds encompassed with this thickness, inertness, grain
untheorizable, hardly memories, reconstructions, reconstitutions

with every death, it is a matter of ethics, this disappearance of worlds
with every death, loss of world and history
with every death, redistribution of materials, severed ties and limbs

i return constantly to this in my theorizing, this loss
no degree of technological recuperation works in this respect
no quantity of text or discourse plays the slightest role
what is re-presented is always already 0/1, infinitesimal

sometimes in a dream there is a horizon of what is gone
it's almost present, not really, you begin thinking of something past
you're thinking, it's almost present, almost on the tip of the tongue
it's never there, it's not even problematic, controvertible

i imagine paths through the world, turning beneath the chairs
beneath or around the rungs of the chair or the four brown wooden legs
paths opening up to interior surfaces opening up recursively
stains beneath the seat of the chair, cobwebs connecting rungs to rungs
the smell of the varnish on older paint, flat faded white shown through
paths moving among senses, spectra and bandwidths
paths moving from generation to generation, imaginary paths

paths of the scraping of chairs, people leaving for the very last time
paths of chairs pulled in beneath old new people eating, conversing
laughter, crying, screams, whispers, talking, singing, filling the air
chairs of first and last times, inconceivable speculations
inconceivable principles, axiologies, hypothetical, hypotheses
not, no ideas but in things themselves
not, the last or second-to-last of the ox-herding pictures
not, the grain of the real
not, the practico-inert or materialist or idealist foundations
not, tat tvam asi or fundamental or surface negations
not, the interplay of signs, sememes, sign-systems
certainly not that interplay of signifiers, semiotics, historiographies
nothing that "might be said" to characterize, capture, recuperate

something of absolute disappearance, annihilation, of trace turned ash
something of charnel-house, but that too has paths, worlds, traces
traces upon traces, perhaps i remember 1968
perhaps i remember 1945, 2003, perhaps i remember 1789
perhaps berlin, ankara, grise fjord, kurume, providence, katmandu
perhaps street, street-corner, room, field, forest, cliff, lake, tarn
perhaps you, perhaps another, perhaps others
perhaps events, occurrences, what happened, what happens

those anecdotes without endings, well what did she say, what was next
receding into pasts, backgrounds, irrelevancies of the present
but never irrelevant, always equidistant, equivalent, always inert
and present and unaccounted for and present and uncountable
and present and unaccountable, all we can theorize is this,
collapse of description and uttermost alterity

the being of which knows no regard, is obdurate in the world
i'd write this, this error of philosophy:
   "philosophy has no regard"
of which is the condition of speech, language, any and all interplay

*

so that i tend to produce, reproduce, overproduce
moving among media, modes, representations - this is all so futile
an attempt to pull back from death, from constitution
or somewhat of a release among interiority and world
negation gnaws at doors and portals
chairs and chairs, or wood, or institutions of chairs and wood
or ideologies or constructs: one crawls, lifts on the back
stumbles to the feet, totters, almost gets it in the air

Noting this year's nominations for the Lambda literary awards, I see none of
the problems about failing to acknowledge the role of small presses in
poetry that is the case with the National Book Critics Circle. There are
some good books and hard choices here. So yes there is an FSG & a Norton & a
St Martins, but there's also Black Sparrow, Turtle Point & Talisman. There
is even a special category just for small presses.

The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

A reunion of San Francisco legends
DAVID MELTZER & JACK HIRSCHMAN

Thursday February 15
7:30 pm, $5 donation
 @ The Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

DAVID MELTZER's new book of poetry, the latest of over 40 books in as many
years, is No Eyes: Lester Young (Black Sparrow Press, 2000), "a prolonged
meditation on the last year of Lester Young's life."  It joins his latest
anthology, Writing Jazz (Mercury House, 1999)--representing
"African-American perceptions of jazz as a subject and practice"--companion
to the earlier Reading Jazz (1994), "a negative critique of white culture's
shimmy with black jazz."  A new edition of his 1971 book of interviews The
San Francisco Poets is forthcoming this spring from City Lights.  Mr.
Meltzer lives in Richmond, CA, and teaches poetics at New College of
California in San Francisco.

Since their work together in the 1970s magazine Tree--devoted to poetic
explorations of the Jewish Kabbalah--he and JACK HIRSCHMAN have shared a
profound internationalist affinity and liberative imaginary ethos.  Mr.
Hirschman is "dean of S.F.'s Marxist poetry," according to an SF Chronicle
front-page story headline last March.  His latest collection, Arcani
(Multimedia Edizioni, 1999), was published in a beautiful bilingual edition
in Salerno, Italy, and presents his recent long poems--impassioned, elegaic
works dedicated to, among others, Allen Ginsberg, Pier Palo Pasolini, Bob
Kaufman, his late father Stephen, and his son, David Hirschman.  Prolific
translator from a multitude of languages (Albanian, Russian, Yiddish among
them) and poets (Paul Celan, Roque Dalton, Mallarm=E9, Artaud, Neruda), he i=
s
an active member of the Labor Party, the Union of Left Writers, and since
1973 a resident of North Beach in San Francisco.

M/E/A/N/I/N/G: an Anthology of Artists' Writings, Theory, and
Criticism

Susan Bee and Mira Schor, editors
with a Foreword by Johanna Drucker

Book Party: Friday, Feb. 23, from 6-8pm
Marianne Boesky Gallery,  535 West 22nd Street, 2nd floor (212-680-9889)

M/E/A/N/I/N/G brings together essays and commentary by over a hundred artists,
critics, and poets, culled from the art magazine of the same name. The editors,
artists Susan Bee and Mira Schor, have selected the liveliest and most
provocative pieces from the maverick magazine that bucked commercial gallery
interests and media hype during its ten-year tenure (198601996) to explore
visual pleasure with a culturally activist edge.
    With its emphasis on artists’ perspectives of aesthetic and social issues,
this anthology provides a unique opportunity to enter into the fray of the most
hotly contested art issues of the past few decades: the visibility of women
artists, sexuality and the arts, censorship, art world racism, the legacies of
modernism, artists as mothers, visual art in the digital age, and the rewards
and toils of a lifelong career in art. The stellar cast of contributing artists
and art writers includes Nancy Spero, Richard Tuttle, David Humphrey, Thomas
McEvilley, Laura Cottingham, Johanna Drucker, David Reed, Carolee Schneemann,
Whitney Chadwick, Robert Storr, Leon Golub, Charles Bernstein, and Alison
Knowles.
    This compelling and theoretically savvy collection will be of interest to
artists, art historians, critics, and a general audience interested in the
views of practicing artists.

Sheila E. Murphy, who lives in Phoenix, Arizona, has authored numerous
books of poetry, most recently _The Indelible Occasion_ (Potes & Poets
Press, 2000) and _Falling in Love Falling in Love with You Syntax: Selected
and New Poems_ (Potes & Poets Press, 1997).  In 1996, Murphy's _Letters to
Unfinished J._ (Sun & Moon Press) won the New American Poetry Series Open
Competition.  Her newest chapbooks include _Arbitrariums_ (Broken Boulder
Press, 2000) and _Immersion Tones_ (Luna Bisonte Prods, 2000).  John M.
Bennett calls Murphy "one of the strongest, clearest, and most distinctive
voices writing in English today."

*******************************

Loss Pequeno GLazier is Director of the Electronic Poetry Center
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/) at State University of New York at Buffalo.
Glazier, a native of the Tejano and Mexican-American culture of south
Texas, is the author of the poetry collections _Leaving Loss Glazier_ and
_The Parts_.  Parts of his cyberpoem "Viz Etudes"--a series of performances
that present a reading and projection of visual, kinetic, text, and
Java-based compositions for electronic space--have recently been performed
in San Francisco, New York, Washington DC, Buffalo, Atlanta, Mexico City,
London, Salamanco, Spain, and Bergen, Norway.  For his reading, Glazier
will present his cyberpoetry with a digital projector.

Chris. Thanks. that's bang on. Actually reading the messages in a =
"continuous flow" had quite an eerie and interesting effect. You might =
be able to claim it as a new kind of poem.  Alan Sondheim must be just =
about on fire! But he sometimes comes up with some fascinating stuff. As =
to Max Gimblett, I picked up a book of his work over here and added it =
to my collection. Juliana Spahr and Rehm are two poets I "discovered" =
over here and alerted a friend and poet here to: in the course of =
finding Joan Retallack. Her "After Images" I photocopied entirely from =
the Auck Uni Lib. And some interesting stuff. Thanks again, Richard.

SAN FRANCISCO:
Small Press Traffic -- two events next week -- double your thrill

Friday, February 23, 2001 at 7:30 p.m.
a reading by
Caroline Bergvall & Hoa Nguyen

As a performer Caroline Bergvall embodies the European strangeness and
appeal Americans once found in the actress Anouk Aimee and for which we
now celebrate Bjork. As a poet Bergvall travels light years beyond
conventional ideas of the line, the phrase, syntax, language usage and
subject matter, exploring as she does a marvelous, scary post-colonial
world of broken signs and signals beautiful in decay. Author of Goan Atom
and Eclat, she is the Director of Performance Writing at Dartington
College of Arts (UK).

When Hoa Nguyen left San Francisco for the independent state of Austin,
Texas, she left a huge hole in our social and poetic fabric. Her poetry is
small in its physical space but looms large in the psychic state,
condensing, like Niedecker, a variety of domestic and political details
into a web so fine you could pass it through a wedding ring. In Austin she
teaches creative writing and co-edits Skanky Possum with the poet Dale
Smith. Her books include Dark and Parrot Drum.

She wasn't wearing any clothing at all, but the emperor of writing didn't
notice.  There was a reason for her otherwise alarming state of undress:
pus and blood oozed from sores all over her body's surface and clothing
would only have gotten soiled and restricted what little breathing her
flesh permitted.  To some, she would have been hideous, but there at the
colony all inhabitants knew beauty and love when they heard it, for she had
taught these things to them with her art and compassion.  Naturally, her
book was never nominated for an award requiring schmoozing, press
conferences, ads, MTV, familiarity with The Survivors Program, or academic

Her son made the Olympics team in 2012 because he could jump higher than
the other contestants in the national tryouts.  Her daughter, the
scientist, invented an alternative for fossil fuels.  Her other daughter
invented computer codes that permitted her to extend her mother's life by
nearly 20 years.  All three siblings had incredibly good taste and they
were each in their individuated ways socially graceful and emotionally
mature.  They chose self-education and declined offers of scholarship to
prestigious American universities.

Their mother finally succumbed to the leprosy that had ravaged her body for
59 years.  She died boundlessly loved and deeply cared for by each and
every inhabitant of the small island where she had spent her remarkable and
enduring life, albeit completely unknown and unrecognised in any literary
circles in the United States.  Her book was discovered a hundred years
after her death.
A businessman discovered it during an archeological expedition he had
financed with monies he'd made producing and distributing
educational videos.  He introduced it to a psycho-social research
institution in Mexico City that derived four distinct, statistically and
genetically supported theorems explaining language's effects on cognition
and self-esteem.  Literary circles in Mexico and South America caught wind
of the studies but neglected to examine the artifact as a literary object
or even re-translate the text back into American-English.

Soon practical applications and psychological engineering technologies
spawned by the psycho-social research institution's studies and their
original theorems were readily adopted by cultures throughout the still
economically deprived Central and South Americas.
By the middle of the 22nd century, nearly every country below the
Mexican-American border had come to enjoy a standard of living equal to
that long enjoyed in the United States.  And some even argued that
Honduras, Brazil, and Quatemala--to name but a few--had surely surpassed
the United States, though the argument was forever deemed unuseful since it
revolved around matters of taste and other culturally derived, perpetually
arbitrary parameters.

By the end of the 23rd century, not one of the twelve emperors of writing
based evaluations for the International Contests on individual opinions or
name values anymore.  All twelve used the new scientific methods.
 Imperfect, perhaps, because all human measuring systems are imperfect, but
as mathematically fair and valid as weather forecasts, evaluations were
likened by some to open golf championships.  Anybody could enter the
contests, anybody's writing could be fed into the computers, nobody was
required to submit biographical minutia.  Anyone, whoever made the best
score, would win.  Somebody submitted the loved mother's original source
text from a computer terminal in Bolivia.  It crashed two of the twelve
emperors' evaluation computers, but that was not an uncommon occurence the
last several years.

"Franz Kamin is a uniquely multidimensional artist and thinker. A
musical composer, poet, and author of prose narratives and performance
works combining several media, he playfully and  seriously incorporates
in much of his work concepts and procedures derived from such fields as
topology and linguistics. But withal he's a deeply romantic artist, much
of whose work arises  from his personal relationships. And after many
decades when the musical world has despised program music, he's
exuberantly revived it and become one of its foremost exponents.
There's no one like him."
-- Jackson Mac Low

Franz Kamin is the author of many works in music and experimental
writing, including ANN-MARGRET LOVES YOU & OTHER PSYCHOTOPOLOGICAL
DIVERSIONS and  SCRIBBLE DEATH (both from Station Hill Press); other
titles and available works listed on the new site below, about which
this news has just come in:

"This Franz Kamin Home Page has been slowly under construction for a
number of  months.  It is not yet too far along.  However the order list
- price list  which is in pretty good shape contains a number of items
that make good gifts  (think birthdays, & Christmas is only eight months
away.)  - At least peruse.   Other sections of the Franz Kamin Home Page
will get more complete as time  goes on (which it does.)"

These are some informal (collaborative) notes on the Poetry Plastique =
Opening this weekend past. The exhibit will be up for a few more weeks =
(03.10.01).                T.C. & K.S.

Curated by Jay Sanders and Charles Bernstein=20



Authentique Plastique: =20
A few jottings from the notebooks of Terry Cuddy and Kyle Schlesinger:=20


The turn out for the opening of the Poetry Plastique exhibition curated =
by Jay Sanders and Charles Bernstein at the Marianne Boesky Gallery (535 =
West 22nd Street, New York) was pleasantly well attended.  The gathering =
welcomed an enthusiastic grouping of invested parties, as diverse in =
their own ambitions and practices as those who offered their works; =
poets, collage artists, bookmakers, fine printers, video artists, film =
makers, sculptors, wordsmiths, historians, critics, etc. and those who =
would prefer to refrain from such introductions altogether. =20

=20

Sanders writes:  "We had a gallery and we wanted to flood it with =
poetry.  Not with "poetic" artwork, but with actual poetry, made by =
poets.  But, we had gallery walls, not pages in a book.  So we organized =
a show of art overrun by poetry and a show of poetry riddled with art."

=20

The, "actual poetry" was actually, painting, sculpture, printmaking, =
collage, video, conceptual film, digital works, and combinations of the =
aforementioned mediums.  Upon entering, I found myself as disoriented as =
those surrounding.  To approach the work was to engage in a particular =
type of uncertainty, one unindiginous of libraries and museums yet =
indicative of both. =20

=20

Bernstein writes: "Not words and pictures but poems as visual objects =
(read: subjects).  Not poems about pictures but pictures that are poems. =
 Not words affixed to a blank page but letters in time.  Not works =
closed in a book but hanging on a wall or suspended from the ceiling or =
rising from the floor or sounding from inside a figure or embedded with =
paint on a canvas or written in the sky or flickering on a screen."

=20

These "nots" are not only nots but nods, also.  As was said often, the =
work on exhibition was indicative of the tremendous history of radical =
(at once grassroots and revolutionary) poetic forms.  With works from =
John Cage, Robert Smithson, Tom Phillips, one cannot help but think of =
their contemporaries, which would be too exhaustive to get into here.  =
Nevertheless, here, each work in mind, calls for a procession of works, =
which could not be shown.  Also, more recent works from such familiars =
as Arakawa, Kenneth Goldsmith, Leslie Scalapino, Mira Schor, Nick =
Piombino, film by Michael Snow, and our neighbors to the north, =
Christian B=F6k and Darren Wershler-Henry (Reading Next Wednesday @ 4 w/ =
Jed Rasula). =20

=20

It is equally satisfying to see the newer works of Jackson Mac Low (with =
works from 1990 and 1975) and Bob Creeley and Cletus Johnson.  The show =
was particularly successful in attending to the importance of =
representing various collaborations, such as Mei-mei Berssenbrugge and =
Kiki Smith, Susan Bee and Charles Bernstein, Johanna Drucker and Brad =
Freeman, Madeline Gins and Arakawa, Lyn Hejinian and Emile Clark, =
Richard Tuttle and Charles Bernstein, and Clark Coolidge's collaboration =
with the late Phillip Guston.  Certainly, each gathering such as this =
cannot be complete, but rather, demarcates a point in the history of =
poetry off the page, and invites more room for alternate exhibitions.


The next morning began with two panel discussions.  The first panel =
included: Robert Grenier, Lyn Hejinian, Emilie Clarke, Nick Piombino, =
Leslie Scalapino, Christian B=F6k, Darren Wershler-Henry, Kenneth =
Goldsmith, and Steve Clay of Granary Books (the handsome catalogue was =
published by Granary http://www.granarybooks.com ). Marjorie Perloff was =
the monitor, and is the appropriate author of Poetry On & Off the Page =
(Northwestern University Press, 1998)

Perloff started off quoting three exhibitors definition of 'Plastique'.

1. Christian B=F6k - "Plastic is the silly putty, with which we =
simulate, then supplant, every facet of reality, converting all the =
varied elements of the planet into one common emulation . . ." (from the =
Poetry Plastique catalog, pg. 66)

2. Johanna Drucker - "'Plastique' is a suggestive word, carrying as it =
does, a nostalgic trace of early twentieth century aesthetic fascination =
with the power of material. An elastic flexible capability to transform =
function into self-conscious awareness through formal properties lies =
latent within the concept. A whole universe seems promised in the =
imaginative era that the word announced."  (from the Poetry Plastique =
catalog, pg. 43)

3. Emily McVarish - "Between 'plastic' and 'plastique', a pull has =
occurred. Like taffy, the word has been stretched, it's ending =
prolonged, its vowels opened and readied to take on a continental =
emphasis, an image of malleability, a whole new doubly fashionable =
connotation. (from the Poetry Plastique catalog, pg. 81)

Perloff's first question to the panel was something to the effect, "How =
is the work in this show not concrete poetry?" alternately,  "What are =
the characteristics that distinguish poetry plastique from the =
longstanding tradition of concrete poetry?"

I was taking notes as fast as I could.  Christian B=F6k mentioned =
something about the "exhausted language of the past . . . " Lyn Hejinian =
said, "Instead of a passive receiver one is an active negotiator . . . =
This work is not attempting to reify into an object . . . illegible . . =
. open endedness."  Kenny Goldsmith suggests that this work is being =
shown in the context of the art world, "at the heart of the art world".=20

Perloff posed a second question to the participants on the first panel, =
"What is the difference between a page and a frame?"  (Is it the page =
that acts as a frame or the chase that acts as the frame off/of the page =
or is the frame of the frame of the page a refrain from the frame of the =
frame?)=20

Nick Piombino spoke on a personal level about his relationship to paper =
mixing saving and pasting together the language & words, "broadened what =
a writer can do, not so much what an artist can do."  In a sense, =
creating new possibilities to understand the relationships possible =
between words and images.=20

One asked, (resonating the history of visible language -- art and poetry =
of the last 50 years --) "Are the pieces having conversations with =
poetry or with art?"  I believe it was Kenny who notes that the duration =
of the time an average person takes to look at an object of art in a =
museum was 5 to 10 seconds.  Hejinian rightfully observed that people =
often slow down for certain media, and the issue of comprehensibility =
came up.  Robert Grenier talked about seriality (the difference between =
looking at words =AD textuality -- and tactile discrepancy of page =
turning reading).

Perloff's final question to the first panel evoked a response: "What =
does intertextuality do for your work?"

Robert Grenier: " . . . literal embodiment of words as facts."

Lyn Hejinian said of her collaborations w/ Emilie Clark: ". temporality =
strongly governing (my handwriting was illegible) the writing and =
reading experience . . .  to slow language down . . . frame . . . =
sentence. Destabilizing . . . it is a visual poem with a capital P"

Someone made the analogy of montage and film and its possible =
correlation to collage on paper.

Here is an equation I scrawled thinking through the notebook:

MONTAGE - FILM - SEQUENCE
COLLAGE - PAPER - SURFACE

I didn't get a chance to write who said that, or something to that =
effect.

One of the panelists made reference to Dominique Fourcade's useful =
suggestion that, "Visuals reduce the audience".  Do pictures =
detract/distract the reader/viewer from the text?

Dominique Fourcade, "The word is to look at."  LOOKING at Gertrude =
Stein's pages. "Gertrude Stein is off the page!"  Writers trying to work =
on-the-page.off-the-page/on- the-page dichotomy. "You lose the charge of =
the work."  Dominique Fourcade," . . . a distraction"  Perhaps this is =
what Antin had in mind with his skywriting project, field of blue, =
impermanence, word dissolve.



Followed with punctual clarity, it was suggested that words need not be =
removed from the page, because they already exist off the page (that is, =
how could you recognize words on the page if they were not already off =
the page?) "Poetry on television?  Distracting  ...The resonance of the =
word"

Perloff concludes the first panel, "Poetry is a commercial that doesn't =
sell anything"=20

Break

The second panel included Michael Snow, Madeline Gins, Tan Lin, Jackson =
Mac Low, Susan Bee, Linda McVarish, Mira Schor, Johanna Drucker, and =
Brad Freeman.

Missed Marjorie's question, but Mira Schor's response referred to her =
own work and the idea of monochromatic abstraction and representation of =
language.  Perloff criticized the idea of tying "an image down to a =
particular meaning . . . image and meaning together.  Sameness and =
multiplicity."

Madeline Gins was heard clearly, although possibly clearly =
misunderstood, as she called for the necessity of more =
"coordinologists". She appointed the organizers of, "Poetry Plastique" =
to be coordinologists, but also recognized that there were many poets =
and artists in the audience whom she would consider also to be, =
coordinologist (A term she and Arakawa developed to move forward in =
presenting their desire to "save the species"). She concludes, "The =
coordinologist needs to take up the sacred task of poetry". =20

Jackson Mac Low made an extensive and calculated statement about his =
work, introducing these pieces as scores for performance.  PERFORMANCE. =
PERFORMANCE. Memoriam of John Cage. Chance operation and score for =
musical performance. Jackson Mac Low's other piece in the show was an =
oil painting, "a poem that became a painting".

Michael Snow mentioned feedback in respect to "la poesis plastique". =
"What was the question?" Historically, "the other side of concrete =
poetry is sound poetry".  "Text expresses...passage"  Through his film =
so this is, "figured out what it was all about... reading artworks...the =
attempt to make artwork that was translatable is damaging...you want to =
read something...read this disk."

Madeline Gins stated, "Expressivity is a dirty word." Regardless of =
label of artist or philosopher, Gins sees Duchamp as a great poet and =
Wittgenstein as a great poet. Brought up the term she created with =
Arakawa "kinesthetic graphicality". She was sick of everyone being, =
"mortal as hell" because it is, "getting us nowhere".  We can reverse =
this, "if we accept the task of the coordinologist"

Tan Lin said "Gertrude Stein within a single sentence could erase =
meaning."

Mira Schor said, "Painting is a language of itself."

Someone quoted someone else from the Information Show of 1968: "If I can =
think of the piece there is no use in doing it."

Johanna Drucker spoke with riveting enthusiasm and tremendous clarity =
about an emerging consciousness that gives rise to popular future =
meanings.  She commented on the polemic reality of her world as =
"existing between Mallarme and the National Enquirer."  It might be =
useful to mention that most of her more recent publications, including =
Figuring the Word are now available from Granary Books. =20

Jackson Mac Low: "Artists should support each other regardless of =
disciplines . . . even though some influence us and some don't."

Madeline Gins: "Double the risk . . . coordinologist."

Dada - invention. humor. surprising us.

Madeline Gins: "Aren't we allowed ruptures and brakes now . . ."

Johanna Drucker: "You are." (A rupture?)

laughter

Madeline Gins smiles (I think).

Perloff ends the panel with the statement, "Art is approaching the field =
of journalism." Charles Bernstein added, "Poetry is a negative economy" =
(As sd. A blank piece of paper is worth a penny, while a piece of paper =
with a poem on it is worth about a penny less.)

Break until 6pm for Films and slide presentation.

I'd like to second the recommendation for this event. Naomi Uman has done some amazing work, including "Removed," a brief=
 film that doctors found footage of vintage porn, wherein each frame the female figure(s) is covered/removed via the hand=
 application of nail polish to the film stock. Her bilingual doc "leche," about a dairy ranch in rural Mexico, is a compe=
lling experiment in both film & ethnography. Also, for those in the bay area not familiar with Stefani Barber's work, her=
e's a chance to become introduced to an emergent body of work that fuses the socio-political onto experience & identity f=
ormation, proving that the so-called "return to subjectivity" needn't necessarily become a retreat from the political int=
o the disengaged trenches of private ironies and the conversational poetics of personality. Crosstown Traffic is a new SP=
T series co-curated by Taylor Brady & Yedda Morrison, attempting to reinvigorate the strong SF tradition of multidiscipli=
nary cross-media work by putting writers' work in conversation with the work of visual & sound artists. check it out if y=
ou can...

Thanks for the report.  Didn't sound to me like
anyone at the gathering was able to distinguish
poetry plastique from concrete poetry.

Dear poetikers,

> mix of stentorian modes with cartoon-like plasticity that is familiar to
> readers of middle-period Ashbery, pseudo-wisdom literature modes ("The
> death of peace is no literature / Leisure is death without letters. /
> Death is without the leisure of letters. / A lettrist's death is without
> peace."), myths, fables, and Surrealist mantras, like this poem which,

Juice
Renee Gladman
Kelsey Street Press
ISBN: 0--932716--55-5
Paperback, 64pp.


"About the body I know very little, though I am steadily trying to improve
myself, in the way animals improve themselves by licking," starts Gladman in
this philosophical but warmly personal first collection of fictional prose
poems.  Like her fellow San Franciscan, the young writer Pamela Lu (in her
book Pamela: A Novel) Gladman is focused on describing an
individual/collective identity and the strange dilemma of selfhood in a
post-identarian, self-conscious age in which all sorts of structuralist
analyses -- psychological, sociological, ideological -- threaten basic
ontological certainties.  "Translation," only 12 pages long, adopts a "tale
of the tribe" breadth to describe a people who "migrated off the 'declining'
coast" intent on discovering, via archeology and some odd logistical
gestures, the secrets of its occluded past.  The sentences themselves,
shooting off into several directions, don't respect the norms of a
leading-sentence paragraph, so putting things together becomes an
archeological feat in itself -- is she alone remembering? has the community
really abandoned her?  But pushed to the task of native informant by the act
of recounting itself, she struggles to explain: "Bear in mind, this is a
land without normal science.  The Floyds' oldest boy was the only one to
decipher that science, but he was sick.  I'm trying to tell you how I knew
we were a tribe.  It was not by the length of our feet or color of skin on
the inner sides of our hands that I knew it.  We were tribal in our
language, in the way ideas came to us."  Having surfaced from this nearly
cultish communality into individuality, she is at a loss about how to
provide her own "feedback," what scales of meaning to use to describe
herself: "You can't just walk up to someone, or in my case a plant, and say,
'Hey, look at how I've grown'," and earlier: "There are games one plays
while one is waiting for a mass return; they are mostly sexual.  I cannot
help but be sexual before these mountains, their flirtish behavior and
exquisite face.  I find that I am moved to ecstasy -- ecstasy being my most
treasured activity.  I would rather have the town, but will miss the
nakedness of these years."  In "Proportion Surviving," the "juice" of the
book's title is revealed to be an aspect of an identity that has been, at
least temporarily, othered, only so that at a later time it can be
re-imbibed and returned to a unitary subject  -- -- a search for balance
when there is nothing "out there" to weigh against.  The narrator becomes
obsessed with juice -- fresh juice only, but also to the point of stalking
the juice aisles at grocery stores: "When my friends came by -- they liked
to suddenly show up with all kinds of breads in their hands, thinking they
knew what I needed and planning on forcing it on me -- I had to tell them I
was busy with my juice."(22)  A crisis involving a lover gets her off the
juice, and though now she is a "weaker character," she writes: "Today all my
ideas are liquid."  In "No Through Street," the narrator's sister, who seems
some sort of figment of the "evil God" in Descarte's imagination, acquires
great fame in constructing useful, if puzzling, signs that have a meaning in
their intended geographical locales but don't  make sense in a museum
context (where the artist has found fame as a "directionalist"), whereas in
"First Sleep," the most fragmented but evocative text, a search for a "Mrs.
Gladman" is being carried out amidst a series of "sleeps," as if identity
itself can only be discerned in the synthetic, but punctuated, moments of
the subconscious.  Gladman writes as if in a post-apocalyptic world, like a
Crusoe on a desert island that is actually populated, but with linguistic
signs instead of people.  Though one wishes at times for a more vividly
descriptive language and perhaps more elaboration of the ideas, this is a
rich and unusual collection, like an alien codex from a culture in one's
backyard.

Four Way Books

ISBN: 1--884800--32--7

A startling debut  from this New York-based poet, 4 is a highly technical
accomplishment -- free-verse sestinas, rhyming quatrains and other verse
forms seem to roll from her pen effortlessly -- and yet it manages to do
without the pastiche or irony-drunk qualities of other contemporary
quasi-formal versifiers.  Her knotty, provocative turn of mind -- part
maudit/flaneur, part Kenneth Koch -- mixes darker, often Biblical imagery
with a quirky humor, as in these lines from "The Traffic Cop": "I don't know
how to say what I'm becoming / But it seems that every time / I consider
lolling on the banks of the lake / Of infernal fire, the ice-cream truck /
Toddles along, hauling its song." (16)  Casting herself as the renegade,
even the vagabond, but with benign intentions peeking through, this poem
concludes on a defiant absurdist note: "Your brand of peace disgusts me, do
you hear? / I am the fugitive who drives the stampede / Of aardvarks across
your lawns. / I have come to tip your cows."  Swift, intense, image-laden
poems like "Ontology Train" are like modern pop versions of Rimbaud's "night
in hell": "The night offers no apology / For its marvelous moody technique
bathed in the venom / Of so many charged similes that conjure the
hagiography / Of man as a vessel caught in a maelstrom / Which is its own
blustery hubris pulsing / Through his homesick blood..." (22)  But her poems
are usually about relationships, about the heavy burden of love and poetic
thought that she shares with her interlocutor, a nameless, mystical (because
"non-I") "you": "Yet you are concrete / Somehow; I know, I've heard your
bee-like buzzing / In all the tiny leaves bursting from their sacs to greet
/ A magical universe..." (43)  Her sestinas offer a lighter view, and
probably sway closest to the ironic tones of someone like an Anthony Hecht
(in the "Sestina Inverno") if only because the necessary play of the form,
as in this brief (fictional?) recounting of a failed affair: "But in all the
San Franciscoes / We could conjure in our souls, / Always there was the
debris left perhaps by the quake of chiding souls / In the intermediate
world, or by some ironic / Sandman reminding us that we were still asleep.
San Francisco / Fantasy aside, you have to admit we sucked / As a couple..."
(48).  "Le Marteau sans maitre," dedicated to Pierre Boulez, has some of the
qualities of Ashbery's Prospero-like narrator revealing the codes that lie
under reality's deceptive surfaces: "In this way, our reactions to the
written word / Open an angle of view increasingly peopled / By our
club-shaped shadows, / And by our footprints on the road which lie / In an
allegorically restrained / Framework of geometric shapes, as elegantly
austere / As the simple arrangement of vessels on a table, " and concludes:
"So you see, the scene / Is quite human after all, a liquid legend / Passing
through crystalline sunlight / And flooding our well-supported interiors /
With an atmospheric clarity emblematic / Of the essential questions blowing
here and there / Like remnants of a foreign language..."  Kocot's images
flow freely, perhaps too rhapsodically for some people's tastes, and one
senses that her own style lies ahead of her.  She writes unrestrained, and
almost approaches a "naive" quality except that her obvious spiritual
maturity, not to mention her lexical flexing and formal skill, deflects this
impression.  Like other young poets, such as Jennifer Moxley and Chris
Stoffolino, Kocot has found a language for her emotions that pulls into her
universe an abundance of memories, metaphors, and verbal twists, but she is
unique in having found a way to mate an urban "post-punk" sensibility --
images of youthful rebellion, cultural disgust, hyperreal love and visceral
superworldly elements abound in passionate bursts -- with a highly
controlled, even learned form that makes reading her poems both an
energizing yet cerebral experience.

specialist with surprises and delights." =ADAsian Affairs

It is, of course, a de-mythologizing time, but nevertheless I've been
writing a long poem for the last three years which investigates the myth of
Orpheus, going back to Plato, Virgil and Ovid and up to Blanchot, Cocteau
and the recent Brazilian remake of "Black Orpheus." Now a large portion of
this poem, "The Story of O," has been published on the net at
http://www.mythsamongus.com -- (it looks better with Netscape than with IE).
I'd be thrilled if any of you had any comments.

Thanks,

Hi Louis,

I don't know if you need to cite a print source for this, but if you are just trying to verify whether he said it, he did. I was in the MFA program at Brooklyn College with him, and he always tried to get rid of as many articles as possible, both definite and indefinite. It was actually rather humorous--any time he tried to fashion a line of poetry as an example of something he was talking about, it would come out article-free.

SUCH TIMES WE LIVE IN! the genius must be more
abundant in this age than in any other for all of
our poets are innovators

what - your poetry isn't innnovative? step right
up and we have just the Program for you - follow
it and you too can join the great flattening in
the Aunt Jemima era of poetry where coloured
sugar water is passed off as maple syrup

that it might be more enjoyable to staple ones
own eyelids shut than read L-a=N+g:U'a/g*e poetry
does not really matter - if your poem does "what
it sets out to do" call the MLA cuz baby - i got
a paper to present and it's a doozy!

end all innovation! most of what is genuinely
innovative at the time is later understood to be
a continuation of the work begun long before the
said author was born

instead we have photographers replacing artists -
"sound sculptures" that replace real music and
real sculpture because both are too difficult
-light verse writers who are inexplicably neither
light nor versed - and if a poem impresses our
identical twin beside us at a cocktail party as
having achieved something ambitious - then of
course congratulations are in order

Pulitzer prize-winning poet Jorie Graham will read along with Mark
Levine for the spring launch of the jubilat reading series in
Somerville, Massachusetts. The reading will take place from 4-6 PM
on Saturday, February 17 at the Burren Irish Pub. It is free and
open to the public; the Burren is located at 247 Elm Street in Davis
Square.

Jorie Graham, Bolyston Professor at Harvard University, is the
author of eight collections of poetry. Her many honors include a
John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Fellowship and the Morton Dauwen
Zabel Award from The American Academy and Institute of Arts and
Letters. In 1997 she was elected chancellor of the Academy of
American Poets.

Mark Levine's first book of poetry, Debt won the National Poetry
Series; his second, Enola Gay, was published last year as part of
the University of California's New California Poetry Series. His
awards include a Whiting Award and a National Endowment for the Arts
fellowship. He recently joined the permanent faculty at the Iowa
Writer's Workshop.

The jubilat reading series is part of the poetry journal jubilat,
housed at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. Other spring
readings include the celebrated Slovenian poet Tomaz Salamun as well
as younger American poets such as Brian Henry, Matthew Rohrer, Cort
Day, and Ben Doyle.

The second issue of jubilat is in stores now. It features poems by
Nobel Laureate Odysseus Elytis, selections from the never-before
published journals and letters of Richard Hugo, a prose piece by
Jane Miller, and poems by Bob Perelman, Matthew Rohrer, Michael

It is in Allen Verbatim, lectures on poetry, politics, consciousness. By AG;
edited by Gordon Ball. He also has some stupid shit in here about never
using certain pieces of language. I don't go by that though. Let the poet
turn her own poem. I get squishy inside when hard and fast rules on poetry
come up. But Allen is still the man!

In his defence, Syson calls it as he sees it, surely that's a strength. =

THE FLOATING LOTUS MAGIC PUPPET THEATER
presentation of
THE MYSTICAL ROMANCE OF LAYLA & MAJNUN

The ancient story of Layla & Majnun comes from the deserts of nomadic Arabs,
elaborated over the centuries and finally put into poetic form by various
poets, including Nizami, an Azerbaijani who wrote in Persian in the 12th
century CE.  It is often thought of as the Arabic "Romeo and Juliet."  The
Sufi mystics of Islam began referring to Majnun's excessive love for his
beloved, Layla, as a metaphor for love of God, and of the single-mindedness
necessary to travel the spiritual Path.

The Floating Lotus Magic Puppet Theater is a colorful and sophisticated
puppet stage of large original hand puppets, vividly sculpted and costumed,
who perform the story adapted by contemporary American poet-puppeteer and
practitioner of the Path, Daniel Abdal-Hayy Moore.  He has taken the text,
whose only available translation is in prose, and transformed it into loosely
rhymed couplets, in a style that is lively, dramatic, poignant and often
comical, but whose basic adult level is aimed at a meditative presentation of
the story both faithful to the original and modern in approach.  It is not
presented as a museum piece, but as a transformed and personally felt poem of
quasi-epic proportions acted out by his company of eight puppets, one of
which is a representation of the puppeteer himself.  Moore, the sole
performer, assisted backstage by his wife, also takes on occasional
life-sized roles of the same characters as the puppets, in identical costume,
with masks identical to their faces, and emerges in front of the audience.
The narration is accompanied by music throughout, on zither, harmonica,
African marimbas, drums, and a variety of other exotic instruments.

Lasting about one hour, the entire play is one of intense love and longing
for the Beloved, with the figure of Majnun, the holy madman, as the
consciousness of the deepest and highest principles of single-pointed
spiritual love.

 ------------

REVIEW OF THE FIRST PERFORMANCE

Po-Puppet Love at the Hands of Daniel Abdal-Hayy Moore
"My love for you is close to grief. My heart's been stolen by a thief,"
mourns the poor common Majnun for the wealthy precious Layla, in the Persian
version of an Arabic legend set to puppet-stage by local poet Daniel
Abdal-Hayy Moore. The Floating Lotus Magic Puppet Theater is Moore's return
to the stage without the hitches he experienced while producing theater years
ago at Berkeley: "Puppets don't get pregnant or fall in love and run off."
Moore was celebrating his 60th birthday on Thursday, August 3, the day of his
one-man show at Main Line Art Center, Old Buck Road and Lancaster Avenue,
Haverford, PA, 610.525.0272. The spry sexagenarian narrated "The Mystical
Romance of Layla and Majnun" in poetic verse, switching between his live
voice and a recording of his voice, the latter of which I, at least, was not
aware until Moore intentionally popped his head above the stage to show that
his lips weren't moving. Also deliberately comical were some of Moore's word
choices to maintain the rhyme scheme. Majnun, an Arabic word for "measure,"
and Layla, meaning "night" or "the inebriation that comes of drinking first
sips of wine," were childhood friends whose lifelong love brought shame to
Layla's family name. They recited poetry to each other until Majnun,
heartbroken by Layla's arranged engagement to a man her father deemed worthy
of her, fled to the barren desert and rocky hills to live wild among the
animals. "He who searches for the beloved in his life is not afraid of the
world." I won't reveal the rest of the story, except to say that the two
lovers find peace knowing that "God's eye that sees all is our wedlock."
Moore was delightful: he sang, played harmonica, changed all the beautiful
backdrops, and at times emerged from behind the stage, donning mask and garb
as the love-mad Majnun. Like the townspeople witnessing the mystical romance
of Layla and Majnun, we in the audience could not deny that "the power of
poetry is great."

Yes, bred in the blood,
down the line it all follows:
first the bombs.

Then, will this time it all advance
to cries heard coming
from shallow sands?

Wasn't he ever worried striking the articles might make him sound like a
Hollywood Indian?

Ralph,
yeah but with the S11 articles they had a chance to do something with some
substance in the end it was pithy newspaper journalism, Syson has a good
ability to call a few people names all right his behaviour in private to the
more marginalised in this country is fairly rude indeed plus Overland agreed
to send back a pile of my work a few months ago but haven't so it seems a
little bit of court action just might get his ethical standards up a bit
heh//pete spence

I am writing a critical prose ditty on the definite article and
would appreciate and welcome any thoughts on poems that
use it in interestingly reflexive ways. I already have
poems/"issues" by the following, in no particular order:
Zukofsky, Creeley, M. Gottlieb, Ginsberg, Silliman, Lee
Ann Brown, M. Duchamp, Barry McKinnon, McCaffery,
Bernstein, Retallack, Coolidge, Russell Atkins.

The only "stupid shit" ever pinned on Ginsberg was some bad weed.

Think of a poetry so choked on rules that it twitches all
over, can never lie still, in fact dies horribly, and repeatedly.
In fact can't die, chokes on more. Now *that's* poetry!

I had read it an oh so long time ago, long tahm: AG nixed def.
articles. So, thanks for proving my memory works -- guess I had
bad luck yesterday searching for a citation. Of course, he
uses def. articles all over his poetry, just not superfluously, I
suppose he would have said.

Blue Light Special at the Smithsonian
By Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman

Lawrence Small has a great corporate pedigree.

For 27 years, Small was a top executive with Citicorp/Citibank. In 1991,
he became president of Fannie Mae, the bully on the housing finance
market.

Last year, he became Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. He didn't
bother resigning from the many corporate boards on which he sits today,
including The Chubb Corp., Marriott International, Fannie Mae and
Citicorp/Citibank.

He's chairman of the financial advisory committee of TransResources
International, the parent company of Haifa Chemical, an Israeli firm.

We ran into Small this week at the Museum of American History. He had
turned over the place to Kmart. Kmart and the Smithsonian had become
"partners" in bringing to the public a traveling mobile museum featuring a
exhibition titled "Wade in the Water: African-American Sacred Music
Traditions 1871-2001."

The mobile museum is a 48-foot, double expandable trailer, with giant red
Kmart signs emblazoned on each side. The trailer will travel to Kmart
stores, schools and elsewhere around the nation.

At the auditorium, Small said that he was "delighted to work with Kmart on
this important project" and thanked the retailing giant for its "generous
donation."

Brent Willis, Kmart's "chief marketing officer" made some syrupy statement
about the benefits of diversity.

We wanted to test Willis' corporate rhetoric against the reality at Kmart.

So we asked Valerie Stokes, Kmart's vice president for human resources,
and the company's highest ranking African-American, how many of the
company's 300,000 employees were African American. Stokes said she didn't
know. What about a ballpark number? Couldn't tell you. Are any of Kmart's
more than 2,100 stores unionized? No. Have there been attempts to
unionize? Couldn't tell you.

We asked Small how much money Kmart kicked in to fund the project. "Don't
know, you'll have to ask Kmart," Small said. We asked the numerous Kmart
spokespeople at the event. Don't know. Can't tell you.

We asked Small why he was turning over the Smithsonian to Kmart, a company
with a poor reputation in America, in a corporate public relations effort
to burnish its image?

"It's not being used for corporate public relations," Small said.

Then, in the very next breath, he asked, "Why shouldn't they get something
out of it? They put up the money for it."

Well, we wanted to know, is it okay for the Smithsonian, which gets
two-thirds of its budget from the federal taxpayers, to partner with major
American corporations?

At this point, David Umansky, the Smithsonian's director of
communications, cuts in.

"I want you to understand something," Umansky says. "The Smithsonian is
not a government institution. Write this down. Legislation was passed
establishing the Smithsonian Institution as a trust instrumentality of the
United States -- not the United States government -- but the United
States. It is not a part of the executive branch, it is not a part of the
legislative branch, it is not a part of the judiciary. It is a separate
entity."

Got that kids? The Smithsonian gets hundreds of millions of dollars from
you and me, and they are before Congress begging for more taxpayer money
-- and it is not a part of the government.

Umansky wants to know: "Why are you so suspicious?"

Well, there should be a stark dividing line between public and private
institutions in America.

You seem to be the only person in America who believes that, he says.

That would come as a surprise to our readers. We have gotten hundreds of
responses from readers who are unhappy with corporate control of public
institutions, including when we wrote a couple of years ago about the oil
companies taking over a part of the Smithsonian for their exhibit on the
Alaska oil pipeline.

You can get hundreds of people upset about the sunrise, Umansky counters.

So, any public institution should be allowed to take private corporate
money?

If it's used properly, absolutely, Umansky says. For the Smithsonian,
there is no problem.

It's been 20 minutes now, and we still haven't gotten an answer to how
much Kmart spent for this little public relations stunt. Umansky doesn't
like the persistence. "Why are you being such an asshole?" he asks.

Finally, Umansky gets us an answer on the funding -- Kmart put up $2
million in cash and in kind -- about $500,000 in cash.

At a press conference at the National Press Club last year, Small was
asked about undue corporate influence over the operations of the
Smithsonian.

"There is a difference between providing the funding and having an
endorsement or having a commercial relationship with the museum," he said.
"So, if it's philanthropy, I don't think there's any problem with it."

In this instance, and in many others, the Smithsonian has crossed the
line. By allowing the Kmart logo and the Smithsonian logo to be emblazoned
all over the press releases, press kits and trailer last week, by giving
Kmart's "chief marketing officer" a stage to spout empty corporate
platitudes, the Smithsonian Institution was putting its seal of approval
on the company.

Every major new exhibit at the Smithsonian over the past couple of years
has been funded by a major American corporation or industry -- the Alaska
Pipeline exhibit funded by the oil companies, the insect zoo funded by
Orkin,  and on down the line. The place has become a museum of American
corporations.

Earlier this year, an exhibit on the American Presidency, sponsored by
Cisco Systems and Chevy Chase Bank, among others, was deemed so important
that it had to bump an exhibit on the work of the late folk singer and
anti-corporate rabble rouser Woody Guthrie. The Guthrie exhibit was
scheduled to run through the spring, but got pulled for the one about the
corporate presidency.

Through Small and his predecessors, the corporate state has overtaken the
Smithsonian. Congress should take it back for the people.

Congress should demand that as a condition of forking over hundreds of
millions of taxpayers' dollars every year, the Smithsonian should kick the
corporations out.

It's time to clean house.

See! We've assassinated the semi colon, the puntus, etc, and now we are
whittling away at the article:  eg " house is good and egg is better and
moon is red and stood he at corner and presented hand" So what's next? Stein
dispensed mostly) with question marks.....its leading up to...well when old
Umbert Eco confided he'd turned the whole thing around and was about to
launch a "meaningless" (I know - in a sense nothing is meaningless: except
that philosophers have difficulty defining meaning...)and enormously
stupendous Work on a vast canvass (to cover the Vatican) formed entirely
from punctus marks etc I merely filled up old Umby's wine glass:
"Impossible!" I roared in guide book Italian. He took it in good heart. In
fact he burst into an amazing extempore Italiano Song. But I just smiled to
myself....and yet, so it seems, the Great Man is laying the foundations for
just such a work.....
    How might it go:

(,,<,,,>>:;;;::{[{{{[[{[{\]\]\{\](0!!~..,;! ""

                Which is clearly a wondrous and swoonable work. And I
thought that U.E. had descended into the darkness. I was wrong. cant win
them all. Fantastic. Amazing. Regards all. Richard.

Best way to Puebla....Fly Delta Airlines from Dallas to Puebla Airport
     or fly Continental Airlines from Houston to Puebla Airport.   It is that
     easy!   Cab ride should cost no more that 170 pesos or $15.


Best places to stay in Puebla....See web site for hotel details.

Area Chairs are in charge of panels and will submit them to the Program Chair.
     Participants are required to register and to pay the registration upon
acceptance
     of their proposal. (This requirement is for the good of all.)  Fill in
the on-line
     registration form and mail check to Peter Rollins (address, above).  To
repeat:
     on-line and fiscal registrations must be completed UPON ACCEPTANCE OF
     YOUR PROPOSAL and not later.  This rule helps everybody in planning for
      a successful meeting.

Historical tours are always part of the mix....Keep track via the web site.

Idaho.

Let's hinder someone's global proposals

I don't know if it's the whiskey talking or

nearly as much as it did an hour ago.
So I said to her,
"You look like a woman of superior breeding,

That was back when Susan roamed the earth

But I got a good feeling about this time,

I met her at a Ten-in-One

I look forward to Alzheimers

While I'm hardly lacking in skepticism myself, it seems to me we have all
heard this one before-- from the set-up of "L-a=N+g:U'a/g*e poetry" (not any
*individual* writers associated with it, mind you) as a straw term for
ridicule, to the exclamation "SUCH TIMES WE LIVE IN!" with it's annoyed
(annoying) implication that we have outpaced the Good Old Days in our pesky
drive for the new.  I'd be inclined to agree with you that the present era's
no more "innovative" than bright shining moments from the past, except that
your tome carries at least as much hubris as that which you would rebuke.
See, I've never actually *heard* anyone say that the contemporary period is
more innovative than other times; & despite a lazy overuse of the adjective,
I don't believe I've ever met a writer who seriously thinks that.  I *have*
read a lot of contemporary poetry, some of it acclaimed, that I think rather
dull; but I've also read more than a little contemporary poetry (including
SOME "language poetry") that seems to me fresh and exciting.  Does this make
it "innovative."  I don't know, & I don't particularly care.  It *does* make
it good poetry, & that's good enough for me.  As for you, Michael, I would
encourage you to lighten up-- maybe find some poetry that really excites you
& write to us about that, instead of wasting your time & ours on this very
tired argument.

Best,

Mark DuCharme

Multi-Literary Event at the Flying Saucer Cafe!


Alan, Nada, and Azure -- and special guest host Gary Sullivan -- are
pleased to announce another event in a new reading/video/film/performance
series in Brooklyn

at The Flying Saucer Cafe at 494 Atlantic Avenue, between Third Avenue and
Nevins

Tuesday, March 6, 8:00 p.m.:

********Edwin Torres & Nada Gordon***********

Edwin Torres, born and raised in New York City, has been creating
multidisciplinary text and performance work since 1988, when he first
performed at Dixon Place in NYC.  His introduction to poetry was through
the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and the St. Mark's Poetry Project.  He has since
collaborated with a wide range of artists and nomads, and has performed
across the country and overseas.  His poetry has appeared in _Heights of
the Marvelous_ (St. Martin's Press), _Poetry Nation_(Vehicule Press), _An
Anthology of (New) American Poets _(Talisman Press), _ALOUD: Voices from
the Nuyorican Poets Cafe_ (Henry Holt Press), among other publications.
His CD _Holy Kid_ (Kill Rock Stars) was included in the sound exhibit at
the Whitney Museum's Last American Century show.  His books include _I Hear
Things People Haven't Really Said_, _Fractured Humorous_ (Subpress), and
his recently published e-book _Onomalingua: noise songs and poetry_
(Rattapallax Press, www.rattapallax.com). Edwin will be teaching a writing
workshop at Naropa Institute this summer.


Nada Gordon is the author of six books, including three forthcoming this
year:  _foriegnn bodie_ (Detour), _Are Not Our Lowing Heifers Sleeker Than
Night-Swollen Mushrooms?_ (Spuyten Duyvil), and _Swoon_ (with Gary
Sullivan; Granary Books). She will perform works from _foriegnn bodie_
(writings from her eleven years in Japan), including "Dolor Core Recede
Sanpo" -- a vocal/corporeal homage to the art of ankoku butoh and to butoh
masters Hijikata Tatsumi and Ono Kazuo. Aaron Kiely has described Nada's
work as "unfocused".


How to get there: Take the 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or D or Q to the Atlantic
Subway stop and walk underground to the Pacific Street exit (at the N or R
or M Pacific Street Stop) or take the B or N or R or M - in any case, go
out the Pacific Street Exit (right exit), take a right - at the end of the
block you will be on Atlantic Ave. Take a left on Atlantic, and about two
and a half blocks down, between Third and Nevins, you will find the Flying
Saucer Cafe.

You've probably gotten this from other people, but the first "definite
article" poem that comes to mind for me is Stevens's "Man on the Dump" and
its last line:

"Where was it one first heard of the truth?  The the."

Take care,

Andrew Epstein

--------- Forwarded message ----------
Our new president has taken some criticism for not having a poet set the

tone at his inauguration.   The absence of a poet, or the absence of the

arts in general, speaks volumes about the president. But, as
the Washington Post shared on Sunday, Dubya can be very poetic.  In
fact,
the following is a poem entirely comprising actual quotes from Baby
Bush.  The quotes have been arranged for aesthetic reasons only by Post
writer Richard Thompson.


MAKE THE PIE HIGHER

by George W. Bush

I think we all agree,
the past is over.

This is still a dangerous world.
It's a world of madmen
And uncertainty
And potential mental losses.

Rarely is the question asked
Is our children learning?
Will the highways of
the Internet
Become more few?
How many hands
Have I shaked?

They misunderestimate me.
I am a pitbull on the pantleg
of opportunity.
I know that the human being
and the fish
Can coexist.
Families is where our nation
Finds hope,
Where our wings take dream.

Put food on your family!
Knock down the tollbooth!
Vulcanize Society!
Make the pie higher!
Make the pie higher!
Major league.

Dear Louis, and I guess dear list, Of course this post will beging with
the letter "I"--oK, so "I" have written a poem called "Draft 33: Deixis"
which is in reference to the "pointing" function a little like "the" but
more inclusive. It is long, and the joke is that it is REALLY as essay
in verse, with footnotes and everything. It was supposed to be, in toto,
in Boxkite 3 (have no word on that), and bits of it were in Xcp and in
kenning. I gave it at the Postmodern poetry conf in England in March
1998 when I read with John Kinsella. The poem is something else-- I
think it is a very serious and deeply amused, amusing poem, also very
political and stricken, has critique of Benveniste and lots of moveable
parts. If you (now I talk singularly to Louis) want a copy, let me know
your address. It will be in Drafts 1-38, TOLL forthcoming in october
from Wesleyan. warmly Rachel

........FEATURING..............


=== David Hess has Frienemies ===
A review of recent books by K. Silem Mohammad and Nada Gordon

(excerpt) "I ask again: Is the poetry strong or weak enough to let us know
what kind of world we inhabit - assuming, as I do, that the poet can still
speak from, or rather to, a position of universality, at least within his or
her culture? Or is the work formally cunning enough to achieve autonomy in
order to escape 'representing' the world as it exists, and so, through its
profound armor/artifice, speak to our world and its historical moment?"


=== Linh Dinh reports from Saigon ===
Regarding translator Cu An Hung

(excerpt) "Hung has a deep appreciation for American literature. American
culture, good and bad, invaded South Vietnam during the war. Along with The
Carpenters and Elizabeth Taylor, Vietnamese were also exposed to Allen
Ginsberg and James Dean. Hung would make the round of the used bookstores to
buy American books. "GI's threw these books away," he said, "or maybe their
housekeepers stole them. There was a lot of junk but there were also many
good books."  Hung marveled at the fact that an ordinary American soldier
would read, for example, Donald Allen's _The New American Poetry_."


=== Dale Smith reads Las Vegas ===

A republished reading report, circa winter 1996

(excerpt) "We had been invited to read poetry in the Jewel Box Room of the
Las Vegas Public Library. Katie moved to Vegas from SF in January to learn
poker from her brother. She established a reading series to help pass the
time outside casinos. Anselm politely dealt with his lack of sleep, while
Hoa and I whined for coffee. We finally had some half an hour before the
reading in a strange, timeless funk, where I couldn't distinguish one hour
from the next. There was no day or night, only inside or outside, so there,
through big Starbucks windows, streamed the desert's winter light. We were
outside and it was weird."


=== Considering Robert Duncan's Take on Wagadu ===

by Dale Smith

(excerpt) "The alienating ironies of our monotheistic Empire, a global
regime of Moolah, forms in Wagadu's shadow, and since at least 1945 has been
the dominate understanding of the "communal consciousness." Some digging is
required to retrieve the great city, and an extension of the affections
after Pound's own great failure is required of poets now. America as an
African, Asian, Indigenous, European promise is a garden and a wasteland, a
refuge and a killing ground. It extends by each successive generation a
failure, a promise, a refuse dump. Americans live in exile, Wagadu only an
idea here. Poets like plants grow by virtue of their roots."


=== Pouch Notes ===

On Jonathan Williams' _Blackbird Dust_, Lisa Jarnot's _Ring of Fire_, Henry
Gould's 2000 volumes and _Gift and Verdict_ by Roberto Tejada...


=== Dig it! ===

Joan Retallack's books of poems include _How To Do Things with Words_
(1998) and _Icarus FFFFFalling_ (1994).  Her work is very widely
anthologized, and she has published an extraordinary range of essays and
interviews. She is the Co-Director of Bard College's Institute for WRiting
and Thinking, and under the institute's auspices hosted an important
conference in 1999 on relations between alternative poetics and
alternative pedagogies. The conference was attended by teachers of poetry,
contemporary poetry critics and a variety of poets who care about the
wider implications of their poetic practice.

Joan Retallack was one of nine poets who read themselves through modernism
at the Writers House, as part of the Modernist Studies Association
conference in October 2000. Her reading in relation to Cage, Wittgenstein,
and Stein is available here: www.english.upenn.edu/~wh/9poets.html.

To my surprise, during a Poetry Plastique panel, I used the dirty word
sacred.  I said something to this effect: The poet's sacred (as in non-slimy)
task is to register events  non-distortively, non-manipulatively, that is, as
accurately (ditch fastidiously) as possible.

For a great many makers it goes this way: If the maker who is a poet does not
transform herself into the maker who is an artist, there is no artist.  Who
but poets
as artists have constructed an art world?!  Transforming oneself is a matter
of rallying coordinating skills for a (for lack of a better term) purpose.
Coordinology is the study of how coordinating skills can be rallied,
combined, blended, and, indeed, coordinated.  Our species needs to learn how
to save its own skin, and coordinologists -- daring poets/artists  -- should
be at the task!!  Email us
(Arakawa + Gins) at revdest@aol.com if you want to know more about
coordinology.

language in internet relay chat (internet relay chat)

there are three types of languaging:

>>hello
hello - just where you speak and it appears, and this serves in addition
as a declaration of presence; it's speech, nothing more - it may be reply
or affirmation or expostulation, interjection or query - there's always
the expectancy of the other, always something in return
>>/me says hello
Alan says hello - thus a performative, Alan performing in conjunction
with the assignation of the /me - the inclusion of action -
>>/me turns around
Alan turns around - the performative connected with a material action -
thus _in the virtual realm_ all actions are necessarily performatives -
this holding as well with programming - so that semantics are intended as
well - /me turns around always already ikonic - attend to this distinction
- just as the speaking above is also ikonic -
>>/echo it is raining out
it is raining out - here the language is itself the material substrate of
the world - the world constituted by language - if the /me indicates
process, the /echo indicates state - however
>>/echo the world burns
the world burns - and the state may well be a state-description of an
action whose performance is subtexted by the neutrality of the (re)quoted
expression
here in virtuality all expressions are doubly or triply quoted -
in ytalk doubly quoted - i type, transmit, you read
elsewhere triply - i type, i read, transmit, you read - three different
instantiations - resonances - sheaves
>>/echo it is raining out
it is raining out - the description of the world is already the state of
the world - however the /me in
>>/me is taking a walk - there is a separation - as in
me < is taking a walk - the expression is piped; in
>>/echo it is raining out - here the /echo is a modification on
it is raining out - as in e(it is raining out) - or as in
e(x)
x
whereas with /me thinks it is raining out -
m(thinks it is raining out) > $n + thinks it is raining out - or as in
m(x)
$n + x
as if there were the construction or constitution of a number series -
in any case the presence of the other - that is
the name $n
as an adjunct or supplement to the string x.
where does this lead - to three states - that of enunciation, that of
action, that of world-constituting language. if enunciation is declarative
- and one might consider an interpolated enunciation here as a shifter -
then action is performative - and it is echo, world-constituting language,
that becomes deeply problematic, in the sense that it is _separated from
intention, from speaker, from source_ - it is an emission above and within
the _face of the world, its alterity,_ within which it resides.
>>one might think of these languagings as modal; in which case echo
references the foucauldian _divinatio,_ but only as index; in fact, echo
is _in fact,_ the construal of the world as-if (vaihinger, bentham) there
is no presencing, no intentional, no actor, no agency. in another similar
sense, echo is the call of a shell command from a perl script; it is
ulterior, an existential alterity, legible, readable, or not.<<

>>thus i call my book .echo, which acts subtly towards the material
completion of a constituted world, however fragile, however thinned (down
to the width of a pixel), .echo which reflects, not narcissus, but the
very grain of the separated and dismembered voice.<<

Subject:      Demon of analogy
Mime-Version: 1.0

I'd like to pose a question to the poetics list, formulated in this way. At
the dawn of the internet age, there was a significant amount of advance
publicity for new forms of authorship and literariness that would be
enabled by the technology. I will call the "demon of analogy" the relation
between the turn to theory and celebrations of the World Wide Web's
implications for literature. The Internet promised a mode of literary
experience that is, all at once: nonlinear, rhizomic, postauthorial,
intertextual, multivocal, nomadic, nonhierarchical, networking, and
feminist (a list of words taken from an opening paragraph in an early
anthology of "hypertext theory").

Yet at the same time many of the kinds of literariness that were being
predicted had long since been developed by experimental writers. So the
question: what is currently the relationship between radical form and the
structure of web sites and listserv discussions? How do the implications of
radical form translate into the ways that sites are constructed and/or the
ways that participants in listservs engage the literature in the ways that
the technological analogy would predict?

A simpler way of putting this might be: what internet sites reflect the
influence of radical forms, and how do they do it? What are some formally
innovative sites, and how have they benefited from the insights into form
that experimental writing made possible? Conversely, is there a
conservative tendency in site construction, so that sites for innovative
writing are really organized in very similar ways to sites that have little
to do with innovative form?

Links would be most welcome, and discussion, either on the listserv or back
channel.

Thanks, Barrett

rich with images and Chung's vital, vibrant voice.  This is a world of
'shrimp gray days' in which Chung asks, 'Where is the cockroach who left
/ its footprint on my bowl?' Many of her poems are compact and oddly
moving narratives that give voice to those who are between cultures.
This is Chung's greatest gift, as seen in her poem about a Chinese woman
who does not understand English yet must ride the subway each day: 'She
keeps the right amount of pennies / in one pocket and upon arriving in
each / new station along the way she shifts one / penny to her other
pocket.  When all the / pennies in the first pocket have disappeared, /
she knows that she is home.'" ***For a glowing review of Alvin Lu's THE

"An entrancing Taiwanese 'Turn of the Screw'.... This devilish puzzle of
a novel...will appeal to anyone who loves the cat-and-mouse games of
Nabokov, the playful elegance of Borges or the rarefied dreamscapes of
Calvino." (Rev. Philip Gambone)  Some of you may may be familiar with

George, all true, but these, uh, excursions have been in the public domain
quite a while. Much more interesting to me is the recent revelation that
there's a poet with an office just a few doors down from Dubya. I refer to
Karl Rove, who published this poem recently in *The New Yorker*:

Take a look at our
agenda. Education.
This year, we picked up
seven points in the suburbs

over '96. Our education plan
allows us to make further gains
in the suburbs. As people
do better, they start

voting like Republicans -- unless
they have too much education
and vote Democratic
which only proves there can be

too much of a good thing.
Look at the course of the campaign.
There's a lot of data.

I think he was trying to write a sonnet, but couldn't quite compress that
couplet at the end. At any rate, I think it's admirable that our public
figures start dabbling in poetry; Kenneth Rexroth even pointed to that
possibility as one justification for creative writing programs.

Our new president has taken some criticism for not having a poet set the

tone at his inauguration.   The absence of a poet, or the absence of the

arts in general, speaks volumes about the president. But, as
the Washington Post shared on Sunday, Dubya can be very poetic.  In

the following is a poem entirely comprising actual quotes from Baby
Bush.  The quotes have been arranged for aesthetic reasons only by Post
writer Richard Thompson.

Hi -

Just want to say that yours was a very relevant and thought-provoking post,
Barrett.

>At the dawn of the internet age, there was a significant amount of advance
publicity for new forms of authorship and literariness that would be enabled
by the technology.

hmm.  if you're talking about when the www specifically came to popular
culture in the early 90s (as opposed to the early days of the internet at
DARPA over a decade before that), a lot of people believed they could define
this "hot new medium."  at that time many people did not understand that the
medium was in fact already in place, and primarily a medium for text.  for
example, the physics community was already familiar with SGML and so HTML
was very much the same thing, albeit easier.  But the literary community was
poorly informed as to the background and nature of the internet.  I believe
that this is still painfully true of the literary community when it comes to
the majority of poetic work I see on the internet.

>"demon of analogy": the relation between the turn to theory and
celebrations of the World Wide Web's
implications for literature.

>The Internet promised a mode of literary experience that is, all at once:
nonlinear, rhizomic, postauthorial, intertextual, multivocal, nomadic,
nonhierarchical, networking, and feminist (a list of words taken from an
opening paragraph in an early
anthology of "hypertext theory").

The internet NEVER promised that.  As a medium the WWW specifically promised
a quick way to share documents, images, etc., (emphasis on speed and wide
distribution) and it offered a way to easily surveil not only the
distributions but some aspects of their usage.  Frankly stated, uninformed
or poorly informed people invented these promises you name out of thin air
without heed to the medium and its ontogeny.

>Yet at the same time many of the kinds of literariness that were being
predicted had long since been developed by experimental writers.

What was the actual promise then?  The WWW wasn't promising anything
innovative, then, at all if the innovations had already happened elsewhere,
right?  Perhaps that is your point, and it is a point that I certainly agree
with.  One large exception (there's always an exception) is the animated
poem, a fine example is Brian Kim Stefans' Dreamlife of Letters
(http://www.ubu.com/contemp/stefans/dream/index.html).  Animated poetry
makes a naive promise in light of what I am describing, but one that
actually becomes more and more fulfilled and attainable, and it ceases to be
so naive, as it insists upon and invents its own reality.  Much kudos to
Brian for taking this reasonable possibility to a place very close to
perfection.  Internet technologies actually made it easier for people who
didn't have much $$$ to easily animate text, and make animations of all
kinds of course.  But as you may be implying, people were already writing,
and already able to draw, well before the internet, and were innovating
outside of it.

I believe the particular promises you describe was shallow, naive, and did
not look for expression in light of the potentiality of the internet.  The
potentiality of a thing is crucial; the acorn becomes the tree, but not the
squirrel.  Such promises were naive when promised and, I believe, were bound
to be unfulfilled.  I still believe that most literary works on the internet
seem to be unwitting aleatory practices.  But like Brian's design linked
above, and some others below, it can actually be deliberate, well-crafted,
and make some radical formal departures from the poetics a the
before-internet age.  Mostly, though, the success of these poetries are
really either evolutionary or critical, but not revolutionary.

>So the question: what is currently the relationship between radical form
and the structure of web sites and listserv discussions?

>How do the implications of
radical form translate into the ways that sites are constructed and/or the
ways that participants in listservs engage the literature in the ways that
the technological analogy would predict?

What is "radical form"?  I think I know what you mean.  Regardless, multiple
links between pages was already innovated in the children's book series
"Choose Your Own Adventure," and in text games like Zork in the 80s.
Again, the internet promised and still promises mainly to allow people to
disseminate and track information rapidly, quietly, without paper.  What
content is placed on the internet is largely independent of its means for
delivery.  Radical form, since it is a product of text and *not* a product
of the *dissemination* of text, would and still will be innovated
*regardless* of the existence of the internet.  OK, the internet makes
multiple choice narratives easy to complete, but it could also be easily
done in a book before the days of the WWW "revolution."

As far as listserv discussions, most of us had word processors before
listserv access.  Again, there's no radical break there; it's just faster.
The parameters of plain ASCII text create some radical forms.  Alan Sondheim
is quite good at this particular "radical form," though again I do believe
ASCII illustrations have been around since at least the 70s.  Their
introduction into poetry, as far as I can see, happens with some of Alan's
work.  Alan would know the veracity of what I say here, and I am sure I will
stand corrected as to the introduction of ASCII forms into poetry.

Your questions are good ones, Barrett.

>A simpler way of putting this might be: what internet sites reflect the
influence of radical forms, and how do they do it?

I believe the real radical idea of form on the internet is the one least
expected...that the internet is still at best a serial enterprise.  Simple
designs are the most radical, since they express the most difficult aspects
of the internet: namely information architecture.

Some websites are out there that try to fulfill such naive promises, and
though they might not innovate or clarify, they are expressions of radical
forms.  for example:
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/newmedia/lexia/index.htm

I mentioned Brian's Dreamlife of Letters above.

Heavy Industries is a site that crisply articulates the positive side of
what I am saying, that the web is at its best and most radical when being
used as a means of enhancing speed of delivery combined with animated text,
while not requiring or making the web out to be some privileged radicalizer
of formal innovation:

Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries http://www.yhchang.com

A statement about the Heavy Industries site:
"It's essential to break rules and do things "wrong" in art. But it's
seemingly necessary to follow rules and do things "right" in making Web art.
This is the big problem confronting the Web artist, for the technique --and
not the art -- of making Web art necessitates obeying strict rules the
flouting of which is punished by absolute failure to create image and sound.
One HTML misstep, and nothing works, nothing happens on the screen. With
this in mind our Web art tries to break as many rules as possible. In our
work there is: no interactivity; no graphics or graphic design; no photos;
no illustrations; no banners; no millions-of-colors; no playful fonts; no
fireworks. We have a special dislike for interactivity. To us it's a paltry,
laughable thing, like getting a kick out of pulling the trigger of a gun:
click: bang. We don't get it. When we click on interactive art, we get the
feeling we're the rat in the Skinner box, except there's only the miserable
reward, not the shock. Art isn't reward, it's shock, or something
approaching it, something we would call beauty. Our Web art tries to express
the essence of the Internet: information and disinformation. Strip away the
interactivity, the graphics, the design, the photos, the illustrations, the
banners, the colors, the fonts and the rest, and what's left? The text."

I would also include my http://proximate.org as a site that has similar aims
as Heavy Industries.  My "radical form" in many ways is really a fake
radicalism, since the code-stuff is extraneous, a joke on the viewer.
(E.g., http://proximate.org/01d3c0d3.htm).  I also treat a side-effect of
the internet: personalization and the way the internet tries to suck a
person in.  I try to illustrate the silliness of that side-effect as a
consequence of language through confrontational, second-person language,
shifting around the person-position of the viewer.  I also try to show that
there are more direct ways to "get personal," hence all of the faces, a pun
on interface.

But all of these ruses are still in part about text, or rather, text's
shortcomings.  Such limitations of text (and transitively, limitations of
the internet) challenge us to either try new ways of delivering gestural,
extralinguistic information to readers/viewers or just to drop the use of
text altogether.  There's your radical form for you.  How to get gestural
extralinguistic information about text across to a viewer, a project that
requires use of formal properties.  Stefans succeeds in his text animation
to codify gestural information in giving words actions that reflect their
meanings, though i don't know if getting gesture onto the net was one of his
explicit aims.  Heavy Industries succeeds at this as well.  again, i do not
know that it was deliberately explored.

Postauthorialism, of which proximate is heavily concerned, is taken a bit
farther.  The roles of the audience and the teller are constantly changed,
and the site has no "cover" with an author's name on it.  It's very
anonymous.  But is this a radical break that cannot be done without the
internet?  No.  It's an evolutionary step from langpo.

i also went a step further with proximate into the sociopolitical domain,
and tried to show that such efforts to capture gesture on the internet (like
when people insist on using exclamation points! in talking to you, yes only
you!) can be manipulative, projective, a part of an ugly power struggle &
that those efforts at manipulation are what langpo was fighting against,
namely, the ugly hegemony of the author-hero.  But even for that I have
prior innovators to thank, like vito acconci and his confrontational art, or
ron silliman and his writing.   The cause is evolutionary, not
revolutionary, and really then nothing radical.  My effort remains more
evolutionary than revolutionary even if i go about the hegemony problem of
narrative in a somewhat different way than langpo.  I think perhaps being
quasi-subliminal in text was (01d3c0d3, come closer) the only radical form I
innovated.  Even then, I wonder if someone else had already tried writing
subliminal poetry before.

The internet seems best when used to  create books or galleries.  Such
things are best treated linearly.

If you want radical writing, radical form, such writing can be captured
without the internet in every case.  on pencil and paper.  or even with a
flipbook of stapled paper.  Perhaps the speed of production will be
compromised if the pieces are put in a book, but that should not matter to a
discussion of innovating radical forms.

Here are some other sites that express radical form at the intersection of
internet and poetry, and do so in a somewhat realistic, mature, and
well-constructed fashion:

Perhaps it would be useful to contextualize this discussion by arguing, as I
am here, that there is a connection between technological change and
artistic change (photography and impressionism etc.), and that early-century
experimentation did not occur apart from earlier changes in communications
technology such as the typewriter, linotype machine, photocopy machine and
so on. I think of this issue especially since, as I view the proceedings, it
arose at the recent Poetry Plastique panel discussions, having to do with
the difference (if any) between concrete poetry and what was on display at
the gallery where the discussions took place.

Subject: Demon of analogy

I'd like to pose a question to the poetics list, formulated in this way.
At
the dawn of the internet age, there was a significant amount of advance
publicity for new forms of authorship and literariness that would be
enabled by the technology. I will call the "demon of analogy" the
relation
between the turn to theory and celebrations of the World Wide Web's
implications for literature. The Internet promised a mode of literary
experience that is, all at once: nonlinear, rhizomic, postauthorial,
intertextual, multivocal, nomadic, nonhierarchical, networking, and
feminist (a list of words taken from an opening paragraph in an early
anthology of "hypertext theory").

Yet at the same time many of the kinds of literariness that were being
predicted had long since been developed by experimental writers. So the
question: what is currently the relationship between radical form and
the
structure of web sites and listserv discussions? How do the implications
of
radical form translate into the ways that sites are constructed and/or
the
ways that participants in listservs engage the literature in the ways
that
the technological analogy would predict?

A simpler way of putting this might be: what internet sites reflect the
influence of radical forms, and how do they do it? What are some
formally
innovative sites, and how have they benefited from the insights into
form
that experimental writing made possible? Conversely, is there a
conservative tendency in site construction, so that sites for innovative
writing are really organized in very similar ways to sites that have
little
to do with innovative form?

Links would be most welcome, and discussion, either on the listserv or
back
channel.

Thanks, Barrett

al, yes it came out in january, it is and will be a pretty important book
i think. first account written by somone who was not a participant in the
mo(ve)ment, first one to use archival source materials. really
demonstrates a whole different set of issues at stake, or maybe how the
issues commonly associated with language writing were framed differently
and posed different challenges for women writers. the first half focuses
more on issues and is more effective to me, the latter half offers
readings (some more effective than others) of individual writers.

Sojourns is part of Fisher's Gravity as a Consequence of Shape. A work in
eight sections, starting with (RED) RED SHIFT 1 and ending with (RED) RED
SHIFT 2, its themes of colour and movement are explored with a wide range of
registers and reference. Here are two extracts:

The ancients used cinnabar, the red sulphide of mercury, for bright red.
Zosimus spoke of it coming from the stars.  Vermilion is the re-synthesis of
mercury and sulphur into the likeness of the cinnabar from which the mercury
was extracted.  After vapourising and recondensing into the top of a flask,
the flask is broken.  It's almost black.  As it is ground it becomes red.
Cennion reckons that if you ground it every day for twenty years the colour
would still become finer and more handsome.

And

rhubatic fummeck thick
onto router's roof run

Athen fibre screened
crogged or laced

get it off thar
git orf like I sayd

yonder hill orogesh
miles from here


Luminarias, Familiar Hinges consists of twenty one four stanza pieces, each
stanza contain four lines. I was immediately struck by the scope, clarity
and multiplicity embraced by this work. There is a spiritual quality which
gives it a tremendous unity.

 Here is the opening section:

Holy be the quiet of our nest
Awash in oils and thin-brushed
Eggshell hue that rests even
In dark, and blessed be the handsome

Furniture, the sparkle of a hundred
Watts on glass, an engine rubbed
Into commotion where a lamp would be.
There are no insects here,

The walls remain as rough
As paths preceding pavement.  All the crooks
Forgot to come, and mercy litters
Turf and tangibles.  The ebb

And flow of distance slims
The merely artificial space between us,
Shaped unfamiliar as
The icing on the cake we won't consume.

Best wishes

Randolph Healy.

this time it was beginning with the interior of the sphere.
the camera wandered around the swollen form.
a closeup image of a breast with a swollen nipple was texture-mapped.
the mapping was set to .15 to spread the image across the interior.
contrast was set slightly high and brightness slightly low.
six lamps skewed to color filters were placed inside.
two circular sections were marked on the surface of the sphere.
these sections were scaled up and slightly outward from the surface.
two other sections were marked at right angles to the first two.
these sections were rotated and skewed and slightly indented.
everything was slightly awkward while the vertices were subdivided.
after several subdivisions the noise control was applied.
the noise was a variable dependent on the contrast of the texture-map.
over and over again noise was added to the sphere.
the nipple distended outward and the sphere was transformed.
duplicated nipples distended inward and the sphere became rougher.
over and over again noise pummeled the sphere.
over and over again protrusions and indentations followed the mapping.
smoothing was applied as much as possible and everything was joined.
the camera began its tilted motion around the internal surfaces.
it was as if a membrane stretched across the universe.
it was as if the universe were one of organs and skins.
organs and skins led to bodies elsewhere on the horizon.
nothing was visible beyond distentions and inundations.

there was just another time when a sphere and liquid sphere intersected.
the camera was outside in absolute darkness and vacuum.
six lamps skewed to colored filters were placed around the object.
the vertices on the sphere were subdivided and an image applied.
the image was of an open vagina and anus mapped onto a plane.
the mapping was set to .15 and cubic global with high contrast.
the image was darkened slightly and mapped across both surfaces.
the surfaces were independent but constituted the object.
the sphere was blown out and distorted with twisted circular patches.
the sphere was extended by selected vertices which were rebundled.
the rebundled vertices returned to the interior of the sphere.
the noise control was repeatedly applied to the sphere.
the anus and vagina began their uneasy work of indentation.
the surface became increasingly antagonized and difficult to perceive.
the camera was widened to 12 millimeters and a course was established.
the course of the camera grazed the surface of the object.
the object was constituted by the sphere, liquid sphere, and image.
the camera moved smoothly in a calculated flyover.
the flyover grazed the interior of the object.

i have it; it's a series of chapters on what might loosely be called "women
language poets".  it has a beautiful cover.  i've looked thru it, it deals
a lot with circles --geographical/metropolitan groupings --new york, calif,
dc --which seems an interesting McGannian way to go about things.  chapters
are more or less on individual writers.  there's one on Hannah Weiner,
which is the one i read carefullly.

Fifty to ninety percent of the world's languages are predicted to disappear
in the next century, many with little or no significant documentation. Much
of the work that has been done, especially on smaller languages, remains
hidden away in personal research files or poorly preserved in under-funded
archives.

As part of the effort to secure this critical legacy of linguistic
diversity, the Long Now Foundation is working to develop a contemporary
version of the historic Rosetta Stone. In this updated iteration, our goal
is a meaningful survey and near permanent archive of 1,000 languages. We
have three overlapping motivations in the project:

To create an uniquely valuable platform for comparative linguistic research
and education.

To develop and widely distribute a functional linguistic tool that will help
with decipherment and recovery of lost languages in distant futures.

To offer an aesthetic object that suggests the great diversity of human
languages as well as the very real threats to the continued survival of this
diversity.

Our 1,000 language corpus expands on the parallel text structure of the
original Rosetta through archiving seven distinct components for each of the
1,000 languages. We have selected these components as the "minimum
representation" most likely to be useful for future, linguistic archaeology
as well as contemporary comparative research.  This sketch should be
understood as a modest frame that is possible to complete for a very large
number of languages - a frame on which more will hopefully be hung later.

The seven components are:

Meta-data/description for each language: Origin and current distribution of
language, number of speakers, family, typology, history, etc.

Main parallel text: We are using translations of Genesis Chapters 1-3 as
Biblical texts are the most widely and carefully translated writings on the
planet.

Vernacular origin story with interlinear gloss: A cultural specific
counterpoint to the Genesis text with grammatical analysis. We will
substitute other vernacular texts if a glossed origin story is unavailable
or culturally inappropriate.

Swadesh 100 word vocabulary list: A core word list typically collected in
linguistic field work.

Orthography: The writing system(s) of the language with pronunciation guide.

Inventory of Phonemes: The basic sound units of the language.

Audio file: Sample of spoken language with transcription and ideally a
translation.

We have finished the collection of Genesis translations for 1,000 languages
as well as parsed the Ethnologue for corresponding language descriptions. We
now need text contributions for all the remaining components and invite you
to submit in your area of expertise. We also encourage suggestions for
languages that currently are not on the list, but should be, given
interesting structural features, genetic relationships, isolate status,
etc. --

Excuse cross-posting:

Alan Sondheim's "Cancer, Mourning, and Loss" has been added to =
Metaphor/Metonym for Health for February as it came to me through the =
internet. It has been edited to be read as it deserves to be read rather =
than for ease of reading and linking. =
http://trbell.tripod.com/metaphor/sond.htm  The full text is available =

For the next issue I am seeking work that explores _Altered egos: how =
the brain creates the self_  and self-healing and repair and it would be =
nice if it came from a masculine perspective for a change.

The Walt Whitman Cultural Arts Center's
Spring 2001 Writing Workshop:
POETRY AS BODY ART
a unique opportunity to study with
AKILAH OLIVER
Saturdays, March 3, 10, 17, 24 from 12:30 to 2:30 pm.

Akilah Oliver is best known as the founding member of the post-feminist
performance art group, THE SACRED NAKED GIRLS which toured extensively both
in the US and abroad.  She was also a guest artist with the homeless group,
The Los Angeles Poverty Department in the early nineties.  She is the author
of the book, she said dialogues: flesh memory, which was honored by the PEN
American Center's Open Book Program 'Beyond Margins' category for
under-represented writers of color.  She has been on the faculty of the Allen
Ginsberg/Anne Waldman co-founded Jack Kerouac School of Disembodies Poetics,
The Naropa Institute, for the last several years.

POETRY AS BODY ART:  This workshop is of interest to multi-discipline
artists: writers, performance artists, actors, dancers, or anyone interested
in exploring combinations of these approaches to creativity and expression.
The class will integrates movement and theory, all leading to written work
and will feature experimental and traditional workshop writing exercises and
critiques.  *

(what I like about this workshop is that it is fluid, beautiful, accessible
to writers of all levels, builds community w/participants and is so much
simpler in action than it sounds)  A.O.

There are still openings so it's NOT TOO LATE to register:
Course fee: $100/$80 members.  Class size limited to 8
Registration cannot be processed without payment.
To register, send five pages of your writing (optional) and payment to:

**A fine review of Chung's CRAZY MELON and CHINESE APPLE will appear
this Sunday (2/25) in the New York Times Book Review's "Books in
Brief" section.  Excerpt:

"A book that is rich with images and Chung's vital, vibrant voice.
This is a world of 'shrimp gray days' in which Chung asks, 'Where is
the cockroach who left / its footprint on my bowl?' Many of her poems
are compact and oddly moving narratives that give voice to those who
are between cultures.  This is Chung's greatest gift, as seen in her
poem about a Chinese woman who does not understand English yet must
ride the subway each day: 'She keeps the right amount of pennies / in
one pocket and upon arriving in each / new station along the way she
shifts one / penny to her other pocket.  When all the / pennies in
the first pocket have disappeared, / she knows that she is home.'"

***For a glowing review of Alvin Lu's THE HELL SCREENS in the New
York Times Book Review, go to
http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/12/24/bib/001224.rv124119.html
Excerpt:

"An entrancing Taiwanese 'Turn of the Screw'.... This devilish puzzle
of a novel...will appeal to anyone who loves the cat-and-mouse games
of Nabokov, the playful elegance of Borges or the rarefied
dreamscapes of Calvino." (Rev. by Philip Gambone)  Some of you may be
familiar with Alvin's previous existence as the author of the "City
God" column on Asian/Asian American pop & experimental
film/music/literature for the San Francisco Bay Guardian.

as if against horizon of dark clouds, around carpet ornament and pillow.
the lighting odd, incandescent glimmer of flame playing upon the skin.
slightly blurred image, eyes to one side, the beginning of reverie.
image turned 90 degrees.
sphere created.
reverie continued, the upwelling and fragmenting of all things and names.
image texture-mapped onto sphere with .15 and no shift.
six lamps signaling.
noise applied 36 times.
continuation of reverie and inward emergence of thinking and thought.
still image of extruded image smoothed after severity upon severity.
torn jagged skin around legs, muted breasts, fury around carpet.
first thinking and then thought.
images of the fury of the polar regions of the distorted sphere.
images of the relative calm of the equatorial regions.
reverie of the heat of the destruction of names and languor.

Would any of the charter members of the la Nguage movement consider Dewey
an influence on the project(s)? I'm thinking especially of that strain of

Hejinian, Perelman, Blank Check, etc etc.

7:30 pm, $5 donation
reading @ The Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

Also, Thursday afternoon March 1, 4:30 pm
free public conversation @ The Poetry Center (SFSU)

both events presented in collaboration with Ivri-NASAWI

Bosnian poet, writer and filmmaker SEMEZDIN MEHMEDINOVIC=B4 was born in
Tuzla, Bosnia, in 1960, and is the author of four books.  Sarajevo
Blues--"widely considered here to be the best piece of writing to emerge
from this besieged capital since Bosnia's war erupted" (Washington
Post)--was written at the height of the war that destroyed Sarajevo, and
was published outside the country in Ljubljana, then, in English
translation by Ammiel Alcalay, in the US by City Lights Books in 1998.  Mr.
Mehmedinovic=B4, his wife, and their child came to the U.S. as political
refugees in 1996.  He lives and works in Washington, DC.

AMMIEL ALCALAY has become among the most exemplary US writers of his
generation.  Poet (the cairo notebooks; A Masque in the Form of a Cento),
activist, widely-recognized scholar and essayist (After Jews and Arabs:
Remaking Levantine Culture; Memories of Our Future: Selected Essays),
anthologist (Keys to the Garden: New Israeli Writing), and prolific
translator from Serbo-Croatian, Hebrew, Arabic, Spanish--his recent work
has been focused particularly on Bosnia and the Middle East.  His
work-in-progress includes the book From the Warring Factions.  One of the
original members of the East for Peace movement and NGO in Israel in the
1980s, he has also done a variety of human rights work for Amnesty
International, the Palestine Human Rights Data Base and other
organizations.  Along with Jordan Elgrably, Ruth Behar, and Victor Perera,
he is one of the co-founders of Ivri-NASAWI, the National Association of
Sephardic Writers & Intellectuals.  Currently a visiting scholar at
Stanford University, Mr. Alcalay lives in Brooklyn, New York, and teaches
at Queens College, CUNY.


DATES

He was killed January 17th, 1994--
Every day from then on
he's been dead

he's dead today too

it's Friday
=46ebruary 24th, 1995.

Every day I have a transcendental experience--
When I go to the bathroom at night
I notice a shadow rising in the mirror
over my left shoulder

it isn't mine

I turn and
what do I see?

My eyes open
in sleep--
a raven has landed on my table
and in a human voice says:
Cherries will be ripe in Sarajevo the 17th of May

I heard
and I'm waiting

~Semezdin Mehmedinovic (tr. Ammiel Alcalay)
from Sarajevo Blues


"Sarajevo Blues is at once a battle report and a philosophical
investigation.  In poems, micro-essays, and prose vignettes, Semezdin
Mehmedinovic=B4 charts the collapse of a world with heart-breaking clarity
and precision.  His book conveys the same clear-eyed passion for the truth
that one finds in the young Hemingway, the Hemingway of In Our Time."
 ~Paul Auster

"Few contemporary intellectuals can boast of as diverse a range of skills
as Ammiel Alcalay.  His work is cosmopolitan in the best sense:  in an
epoch of superficial globalism his approach to the cultures he deals with
is always rigorous, always meticulously respectful of particularities and
differences.  There is no one better qualified to explore the meaning of
today's 'culture wars,' locally and globally."
~Amitav Ghosh

I'm considering the idea of putting together a volume of essays on the
poetry & prose of Robert Kelly -- to my mind one of our major poets who has
not had his critical due to date -- and would like to hear from people on
the list with any suggestions. Please backchannel (joris@albany.edu).

The point about words like 'innovate' is that their
meaning is always so context-dependant. The decline of
the LANGUAGE thing can probably be traced to the time
that its exponents forgot this, and began to fetishise
their forms, ie treat them as intrinsically
innovative. Nowadays, a new book by, say, Heijinian
is, for all its  beauty, about as innovative as a
sword behind museum glass.

What interests me is the possibility of understanding
the decline of movements like the Language thing
*sociologically*

Perhaps the spread of the formal fetishism (which was
already evident in  Silliman's preface-thing to The
American Tree, a preface which featured, alongside
some really good insights,  outrageous generalisations
of the lessons of local practice, generalisations
presented in the form of a raft of proscriptions and
excommunications ('Vonnegut stylises his
acquiescence'-bah!)) corresponded with the (not just
academic) institutionalisation of the writing and
writers who made up the school. From declassed
intellectuals to struggling petit-bourgeoisie, over
10-15 years?

Sorry this is very badly put (formal limits imposed by
cybercafe time!)

Cheers
Scott

'Poetry Plastique'
Marianne Boesky
535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea

Through March 10

Art and poetry: made for each other. So it has always
been. Poets write about art; artists turn to poetry
for ideas. Sometimes the two disciplines meet in
collaboration; occasionally that collaboration is
forged in the work of a single person. All these
variables are aired in "Poetry Plastique," in which
image and word are flexibly intertwined.

Organized by Jay Sanders, who is on the staff at
Boesky, and the poet Charles Bernstein, the selection
covers a stretch of recent historical ground. At the
early end are scribbly, word-peppered Blakean pages by
Robert Smithson from 1962 and a labyrinthine written
piece by the arch-Fluxian Jackson Mac Low from 1975.
The 1970's are well represented here, with work by
Carl Andre, Wallace Berman and text- and-image
collaborations by Arakawa and Madeline Gins.

Other work is new. Mr. Bernstein collaborates with
Richard Tuttle on a witty sculpture made of plump,
strung together 3-D letters, and with Susan Bee on a
noirish painting in which Emily Dickinson and Mickey
Spillane face off. Dickinson's attenuated handwriting
finds an echo in Mira Schor's word paintings. The show
enters the digital realm in a rich text-and-image work
by Johanna Drucker and Brad Freeman, and in Tan Lin's
computer-generated poetry pulsing away on three
monitors.

The day after the show opened, the gallery was host to
a series of related panel discussions and readings.
Poets and artists participated. A big audience turned
up. It was great. The buzz of voices and ideas made
the art in the room — and Chelsea itself, for that
matter — feel alive and interactive. Some of the
pieces really need that charge; they look staid and
hermetic without it. But others do fine on their own,
and the cross-disciplinary concept behind the show is
ripe for further exploration.

Perhaps Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bernstein already have
further plans along these lines. Meanwhile, art and
texts mutually ignite elsewhere in the city these
days: in Cy Twombly's not-to-be-missed "Coronation of
Sesostris" paintings, based on a poem by Patricia
Waters, at Gagosian Gallery (980 Madison Avenue, at
76th Street, through tomorrow); in a collaboration
between the painter Max Gimblett and the poet John Yau
at Ethan Cohen Fine Art (37 Walker Street, SoHo,
through March 10); in a series of collaborative prints
by contemporary Puerto Rican artists and poets at El
Taller Boricua (Lexington Avenue at 106th Street,
through tomorrow); in an exhibition of contemporary
text-based works, "A Way with Words," at the Whitney
at Philip Morris (120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street,
through March 30); and in a jewel of an exhibition of
artists' diaries, with bold little drawings and
sonnet-size personal jottings, at the Archives of
American Art (1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st
Street, through May 31).

Maybe a nice poem about taking payoffs for pardons would be more
appropriate? Rolls off the tongue nicely, doesn't it?

Yes, I just read it, and know Ann and her work.
It's a must-read, based on extensive archival work, as well as the writer's
knowledge of feminist and other theory.  I'm about to write a review of the
book for _Verse_, so stay posted!

aloha, Susan Schultz

AMEN! I REPUDIATE EVERY WORD! LET US NOT BE
OVER-RUN BY SEMI-PUBLISHED POETS WITH WILD
GENERALITIES!

the truth is i was completely drunk when i wrote
that - i'm still proud of the title tho  - still
- yr right about "innovative" being the most
over-used of adjectives - more on book blurbs
than poets themselves

some language poets bore me to tears (Silliman,
Bernstein, Palmer) and some are vital voices
(egads did i just say that?) (Ashbery(?)
Hejinian, Bernstein [do i contradict myself?])

i find a wierd and quirky side of myself - the
more "radical" my poetry gets the more
"conservative" my poetics gets - each a bulwark
of the other -

every day and in every way i feel as though i am
on the cusp of some great poetic breakthrough
that will be like the razing of the Library of
Alexander - only more extravagant and fancy free
- and no matter what poems i read i feel like i
am just reading myself - what a narcissist!

so of course there is poetry that excites me - my
own! i read and re-read it all the time - i quote
it to women in the hopes of seduction (don't try
it, it won't work) - in fact i love it so much i
sometimes even change it! i would NEVER do that
to anyone elses poem - even if i was in a
workshop and someone begged me too

so let us all be well - and not concern ourselves
with whether and argument is tired or not - just
put it to bed - pull the blankets up under its
cute little chin - kiss it on the forehead and
say goodnight

for when morning comes - surely the argument will
rise and make coffee - maybe even have a morning
pee

good night my friends - and god bless you every
one!

> === David Hess has Frienemies ===
> A review of recent books by K. Silem Mohammad
> and Nada Gordon
>
> (excerpt) "I ask again: Is the poetry strong or
> weak enough to let us know
> what kind of world we inhabit - assuming, as I
> do, that the poet can still
> speak from, or rather to, a position of
> universality, at least within his or

> enough to achieve autonomy in
> order to escape 'representing' the world as it
> exists, and so, through its
> profound armor/artifice, speak to our world and
> its historical moment?"
>
>
> === Linh Dinh reports from Saigon ===
> Regarding translator Cu An Hung
>
> (excerpt) "Hung has a deep appreciation for
> American literature. American
> culture, good and bad, invaded South Vietnam
> during the war. Along with The
> Carpenters and Elizabeth Taylor, Vietnamese
> were also exposed to Allen
> Ginsberg and James Dean. Hung would make the
> round of the used bookstores to
> buy American books. "GI's threw these books
> away," he said, "or maybe their
> housekeepers stole them. There was a lot of
> junk but there were also many
> good books."  Hung marveled at the fact that an
> ordinary American soldier
> would read, for example, Donald Allen's _The
> New American Poetry_."

> === Dale Smith reads Las Vegas ===
>
> A republished reading report, circa winter 1996
>
> (excerpt) "We had been invited to read poetry
> in the Jewel Box Room of the
> Las Vegas Public Library. Katie moved to Vegas
> from SF in January to learn
> poker from her brother. She established a
> reading series to help pass the
> time outside casinos. Anselm politely dealt
> with his lack of sleep, while
> Hoa and I whined for coffee. We finally had
> some half an hour before the
> reading in a strange, timeless funk, where I
> couldn't distinguish one hour
> from the next. There was no day or night, only
> inside or outside, so there,
> through big Starbucks windows, streamed the
> desert's winter light. We were
> outside and it was weird."

> === Considering Robert Duncan's Take on Wagadu
> ===
>
> by Dale Smith
>
> (excerpt) "The alienating ironies of our
> monotheistic Empire, a global
> regime of Moolah, forms in Wagadu's shadow, and
> since at least 1945 has been
> the dominate understanding of the "communal
> consciousness." Some digging is

> African, Asian, Indigenous, European promise is
> a garden and a wasteland, a
> refuge and a killing ground. It extends by each

> failure, a promise, a refuse dump. Americans

Jordan, my experience has been that no, none of the language poets would
*consider* Dewey an influence by and large, - but that doesn't mean that
Dewey didn't have an influence on language poetry: his influence on Black
Mountain poetics and, via WCW and Paul Goodman, on O'Hara was major, so
the Language folks were getting Dewey second hand even if they didn't
realize it.  My article in Kenning 2.2. gets into this.  There's a
connection too between Dewey (and more generally, pragmatism) and, say,
Jameson's various discussions of Narrative as Socially Symbolic Act,
that's obviously important to LangPo (the shorthand for this is
Althusser + Kenneth Burke = Jameson.)  Okay, more to say but gotta go..

> Barrett Watten wrote asking about many things concerning the internet and authoring and radical form (and having read Patrick's response which made many good points).

To piggyback on Patrick's thoughts a little, I often thought much of
early hypertext hype was "lame" for a better term, exactly because of my
experiences with choose your own adventure books. I didn't see any real
"new" thing in it. Of course, I had enjoyed "choose your own adventure"
and I enjoyed early hypertext works and its theories in the same way,
but didn't see a whole new world.

But I do think there are some radical changes happening on the internet
and to see them you have to look away from what is going on in overt
literature and instead see all the things happening in the environment.

First there is the user experience which can be truly post-authorial.
The main revelation there is the mosaic-communicator-ie browser. Much
more important than the hyperlinks constructed by the author is the
users ability to jump to an entirely different location, whether typing
in a location (which maybe a search engine) or using their bookmarks or
whatever. Again, this is just another element of speed, one was always
able to flip from a book to a dictionary and back. But with the element
of speed one enhances the possibility of
overlapping/additive/synthesizing meanings.

Also, I think "personalization" is one of the truly amazing things about
the Internet's possibility. Web sites are able to serve up never-ending
configurations and choices of elements based on personal profile data.
Look at how Amazon.com matches your consumer record (including what
books you've bought, your age, sex, where you live, etc. etc.) with a
clickstream history (what books you've looked at, what kinds of banner
adds have inspired you to click, etc. etc.) to deliver overt and covert
advertisements throughout your visit.

Now all that is being done in the service of commerce, obviously. Porn
was a leading factor in the Internet's usage and "innovation," and
commerce picked up on its heels (though less successfully?). So if you
are looking for really radical uses of technology look to those sources
and find the ways you can bring them into an effort at creating new ways
of meaning/new experiences in literature.

something of an aside: one of the most radical things I find on the net
are those sites that list what people are typing into search engines in
near real time, it's a great living snapshot of the "meanings" people
are looking for, like the PeepingTom screensaver

to me, the radical form of the Internet right now seems to be dynamic
publishing, whether behind the scenes or openly: sites/pages/areas that
are in constant flux whether controlled by a users decisions
(overtly/covertly) or related to happenings around the Internet
environment. I really look forward to seeing how various artists use
these tools moving forward and how it all comes to effect how we
make/partake in meaning/experience.

for whatever reason I'm thinking of that Autechre CD where the last
track was actually a piece of software that was a visual interface for
making music... anybody remember that? In a lot of ways that's a whole
'nother side of what the Internet has done for/to literature. Like what
about a kids site (headbone.com) having a poetry section where tones of
pre-teens post daily poems/contribute to a functioning literary
community, what does that mean for poetry or about poetry?

so many tangents to walk down here, apologies for scattering

From the New York Times


February 25, 2001

John Fahey, 61, Guitarist and an Iconoclast,
Dies at 61

By JON PARELES

John Fahey, a guitarist who carved out a private corner of Americana
only
to see it become a foundation of new age music, died on Thursday at
Salem
Hospital in Salem, Ore., after undergoing sextuple heart bypass surgery,

said Mitch Greenhill, the president of Folklore Productions and Mr.
Fahey's
executor. Mr. Fahey was 61 and lived in Salem.

Playing a six-string acoustic guitar, Mr. Fahey used country-blues
fingerpicking
and hymnlike melodies in stately pieces with classical structures.
Wordless and
unhurried, his music became a contemplation and an elegy, a stoic
invocation
of American roots, nameless musicians and ancestral memories. Behind its

serene surface, the music was both stubborn and haunted.

"I was creating for myself an imaginary, beautiful world and pretending
that I
lived there, but I didn't feel beautiful," Mr. Fahey said in an
interview with
The Wire magazine in 1998. "I was mad but I wasn't aware of it. I was
also very
sad, afraid and lonely."

From the beginning, he was an iconoclast and a maverick. He started two
independent labels. In 1959 he founded Takoma Records, which released
his
own albums, blues albums and recordings by other guitarists including
Leo
Kottke. And in 1995, he and his manager started Revenant Records,
dedicated
to what it called American Primitive music.

Although he didn't sing or write lyrics, Mr. Fahey was a voluble author
of liner
notes. His albums were crammed with parodies of academic analysis and
tales
of a fictitious blues guitarist, Blind Joe Death, and his disciple, John
Fahey, who
purportedly "made his first guitar from a baby's coffin." He shared a
Grammy
Award for the liner notes to the 1997 "Anthology of American Folk Music"

 (Smithsonian Folkways).

Mr. Fahey was born in Takoma Park, Md., on Feb. 28, 1939. His father and

mother both played piano, and his father also played Irish harp. On
Sundays,
the family went out to hear bluegrass and country music. Mr. Fahey said
that
hearing Bill Monroe's version of Jimmie Rodgers's "Blue Yodel No. 7" and

Blind Willie Johnson's "Praise God I'm Satisfied" changed his life.

He started teaching himself guitar when he was 12. He also began
collecting
and trading old 78-r.p.m. recordings of hillbilly songs, blues, gospel
and jazz,
going door to door in the rural South to find them. A fellow collector,
Joe
Bussard Jr., recorded Mr. Fahey on 78-r.p.m. discs for his Fonotone
label, under
the name Blind Thomas. In 1959 Mr. Fahey recorded his first album and
pressed 100 copies, the first Takoma Records album. One side of the LP
was
credited to "Blind Joe Death," the other to "John Fahey."

Mr. Fahey studied philosophy at American University in Washington and
then at the University of California in Berkeley, where he played at
folk clubs
in his first paid engagements. In 1963, he recorded his second album,
"Death
Chants, Breakdowns and Military Waltzes." He and his partner in Takoma
Records, ED Denson, tracked down two Mississippi bluesmen, Bukka White
and Skip James, and recorded them for Takoma, bringing them to new
audiences on the folk-revival circuit.

Mr. Fahey entered a graduate program in folklore at the University of
California at Los Angeles in 1964, and wrote his master's thesis about
the Delta
bluesman Charley Patton. After he received his degree, Mr. Fahey turned
to
music full time.

His compositions expanded, embracing the modalities of raga along with
dissonances not found in country or blues; he used unconventional
tunings
and turned some traditional picking patterns backward. He also
experimented
with tape collages, often to the annoyance of folk fans. Though hippie
listeners
may have heard his music as psychedelic, he was a bourbon drinker.

Along with his Takoma releases, Mr. Fahey also made albums for Vanguard
and Reprise Records. His pristine 1968 solo album of Christmas songs for

Takoma, "The New Possibility," sold 100,000 copies initially and has
been
perennially reissued. Mr. Fahey spent time at a Hindu monastery in
India; a
1973 album of extended solo pieces, "Fare Forward Voyager" (Takoma) is
dedicated to a guru. Takoma was sold to Chrysalis Records in the mid-
1970's,
and in the 1980's Mr. Fahey made albums for the Shanachie and Varrick
labels.
New age performers like the pianist and guitarist George Winston, who
made
his first album for Takoma, prospered with a more ingratiating
solo-guitar
style.

Mr. Fahey suffered setbacks in the late 1980's. He divorced his third
wife,
Melody, and lost his house. He suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome
and
diabetes. His drinking grew worse. For a time, he lived at the Union
Charity
Mission in Salem. He often supported himself by scouring flea markets
for
used classical records to sell to collectors. He sometimes pawned his
guitars.

But he was rediscovered in the 1990's. Rhino Records compiled a
retrospective,
"Return of the Repressed," in 1994, and alternative rockers working on
"post-rock" instrumental music sought out Mr. Fahey. He sobered up and
restarted his career. In 1996 he released "City of Refuge" (Tim/Kerr),
followed
by two albums in 1997 and one each in 1998 and 2000. He continued to
experiment, playing electric and lap steel guitars and freely using
electronic
effects.

Last year, he published a book of loosely autobiographical stories, "How

Bluegrass Music Destroyed My Life" (Drag City Press).

"I never considered for a minute that I had talent," he wrote in 1994.
"What I
did have was divine inspiration and an open subconscious."

Wondering if anyone is interested in submitting flash fiction peices.
I'm stumbling for online guest columnists for my column at Ink19 (a
music/culture print and online weekly mag).

Look around at the flashes I've written, through the archives there, and if
you feel even briefly... let me know.

Post)--was written at the height of the war that destroyed Sarajevo, and
was published outside the country in Ljubljana, then, in English
translation by Ammiel Alcalay, in the US by City Lights Books in 1998.  Mr.

I agree that Stefan's poem pushes the glass ceiling of Flash
animation (it is more impressive than I, in my present graphic
art-anemic state, could ever hope to be), but the potentialities of
digital poetry are just beginning to be approached.   After all,
while computer animations do improve in speed-of-creation,
cost-of-creation, and logistics-of-dissemination over video and film
poetry, there is nothing inherently "new" about Flash's animation
capabilities (except the fact that its vector-based operations
drastically reduce file sizes.

Still, Flash seems to me to be the best tool for interactive poetry
construction.  The problems with HTML from a literary standpoint have
been long bemoaned by various fiction writers and critics who all
seem to agree that Storyspace has HTML beat.  As far as poetry goes,
the main problem I see with HTML is that it does not offer a poet
adequate control over the temporal elements of their work, especially
between elements.  As Philippe Bootz has noted, works can vastly
differ dependent entirely on the reader's machine (a work can be
affected by everything from CPU speed to bandwidth).  In general,
this does not effect web-based fiction, but to a poet concerned with
the musicality of their interactive piece, "linking time" becomes an
issue of rhythm.  For the first time, (and I know I sound much like
Olson here) a poet can, with Flash, have complete "scoring" control
of their interactive work in a way only approximated in  HTML (this
is an issue I'm currently exploring in an article called,
appropriately enough "The Digital Projective").  Flash brings
capabilities formerly only available in  programs like Hypercard to a
cross-platform web-based audience.

The temporal issue is an important one, especially for poets who are
less inclined toward the Concrete side of experimentalism.  It only
gets stickier with when begins look at potentialities for virtual 3d
(VRML) writing spaces (see Matt Kirschenbaum's "Lucid Mapping" or Aya
Karpinska's "Ex-Statis" for examples).  How can a poet control time
between elements and still allow for the explorative possibilities of
3d textual landscapes?

As we explore new space, I'm not sure we can't forget time--aren't
they intimately related?
