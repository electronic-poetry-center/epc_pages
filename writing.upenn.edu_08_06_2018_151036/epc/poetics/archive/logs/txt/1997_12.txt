Hmm, the core of my message appears to have been dropped. So, try again:

Does anybody have an address, physical or virtual, for Natacha Lallemand, a
student at the Sorbonne? If so, please back-channel me or call directly.

Thanks!

Thanks to Douglas Messerli for his thought-full memoir/eulogy of James
Laughlin. Whatever 'we' might think of Pound, or even of Laughlin's poetry,
I think Douglas caught both the import of his life-work with ND, & what
those little b&w paperbacks could mean to so many young readers who had
previously known only the pocketbooks at the corner drugstore...Of course,
the hardback NDs were nice to hold too, if one could afford the awful cost
of $3 or $4 (way back when)...

A bizarre little piece of propaganda: as an 11 year old boy in Germany
during WWII, my father received school instruction in the evils of
Shakespeare. Seemingly, Shakespeare was proof of the visciousness of the
English, and of their lack of imagination and culture--a true barbarian who
was unable to end his plays in any manner other than the slaughter of
everyone on stage. This was portrayed as the ultimate in stupidity.

An attempt at political resistance, or just a horrific irony?

Just out of curiosity, who was the anti-Shakespeare? Goethe? Holderlin?

Dear Poets,

Poetfest is currently seeking submissions for the
upcoming January 98 Anthology, which will
be published exclusively on the World Wide Web
and made freely enjoyable to readers and fellow
poets of all ages, from all over the world.

Poetfest is an ongoing series of thematically-
arranged poetry anthologies.  The theme for the
next collection is "Journies."  The deadline is
December 30, 1997, but I would appreciate
hearing from you earlier, if possible.

All poets are welcome and encouraged to submit
their best material (up to 10 poems, any style, up
to 100 lines, plain text) for consideration at the
Poetfest site:

 http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/7101/poetfest.htm

I will consider more and/or longer poems if you
wish.  You may send me poems through the site
itself or to me directly via e-mail.  Please read the
guidelines before submitting.  Payment is
publication, and all rights always remain with
the author.

You may also view the first anthology (Fall 97),
which is presently available on-line until
January 1998.  Your comments and suggestions
are most welcome.

I look forward to hearing from you, and I thank
you all for your time and consideration.  Take care.

                        Truly yours,
                        Robert

Attention potential partners:

At last a syntax sophisticated and inclusive enough to contain your entire
cultural needs.  You may never need to speak spontaneously again.

Syntax is changing faster and faster.  Experts predict that by 2003,
linguistic systems will need major updates every few days. We may not be at
that level yet, but here at Global Telelanguage Resources, we don't think
you can be too prepared. We work with structures dynamic and flexible
enough to configure even the most disjunctive approaches to communication
and art.

Following directly from the many daring innovations in poetry performed in
the 1970s and 1980s, GTR features an expanded program of verbal initiatives
to bring us the next millennium and beyond. Where previous schools of
poetry promised you a total syntax, GTR will give you a truly "Global" one.

Check out the future of poetics at

Sincerely yours,

Fraser Thomas

From my e-mail:

Calling all Writers.

It's not often we here at Pif Magazine interrupt our in-between issue
sabbatical, but a worthy cause has come to our attention and we'd like to
spread the word.

Any of you who've spent any time in the Washington, D.C., area are already
well-aware of Atticus Books, home to (among others) Gargoyle Magazine,
Lucinda Ebersole, Richard Peabody.  The place is a proving ground for many of
the District's aspiring poets and writers.  And one of the joint's staunchest
supporters, Kathy Acker, needs our help.  Her cancer is spreading and the
prognosis isn't good.

Kathy's friends are holding a benefit (to raise money to off-set her costly
medical treatments) and they ask any and all interested writers to attend.
 Richard Peabody says: "We're asking people to give what they can afford and
we'll pass the hat.  Kathy's in Mexico ...  She had a double mastectomy last
year. Was in remission. Now has cancer of liver, kidneys, spleen, you name
it.  Her bills are astronomical and we're just going to try and help a
little. "

The event will be held on Saturday, December 13th, at 7 pm.  The list of
attending writers is large, so don't miss out.  For those who don't already
know, the address for Atticus Books is: 1508 U Street, NW Washington D.C.
20009 (On the Green Line. Just 2 blocks from the U Street/Cardozo METRO
Station).

For more information about the benefit you can email
atticus@atticusbooks.com, or phone (202) 667-8148.

Thanks,

If you have any advice about getting 501(c)3 status for a small press, Lee
Chapman would appreciate hearing it.  Her fax is 913-749-7394, her e-mail
Leechapman@aol.com.  In particular, she'd appreciate copies of successful

Call for Papers: Comparative American Poetries

American Studies Association, Seattle, Washington, November 19-22,
1998

I am seeking proposals for presentations/performances that place U.S.
poetic traditions in international and/or diasporic contexts, that
take a comparative approach to U.S. poetries, or that articulate
(dis)connections between poetries of the Americas.  Of particular
interest are proposals on performance poetries, community-based
poetries, poetry and the public sphere, poetry and/as art activism,
poetry and/as historical 'narrative,' poetry and/as pedagogy, bi- or
multilingual poetries, 'border' poetries, poets in dialogue,
cross-cultural poetics.  Alternative approaches to writing,
presenting, and eliciting audience participation are strongly
encouraged.

Please send abstracts, proposals, or papers by January 10 to Jennifer
Drake, Department of English, Indiana State University, Terre Haute,
IN 47809, or by email: ejdrake@root.indstate.edu

Chris,
I really didn't buy anything on Buy Nothing Day, _except_ a
box of smuggled Monte Cristo's fresh from Havana. That doesn't
count, right?

But here's what I replied (I know no one cares, but so what?) to
David Israel a couple days back, which my reply key sent somewhere
into the ether. David said something linke "no, Kent, no, things also
have substantiation," to which I replied: "Right. What I
meant in that part of my little ramble is that the phenomenal
expression of the commodity is something utterly other than its
noumenal being. Marx's somewhat wild point is that the objective but
hidden social relations of capitalism _bring into appearance_ the
status of the commodity as a "discrete substance," as if it were a
thing in and of itself. Thus, what we don't see is more real than
what we do, and so on. This magic act of the commodity, says Marx,
is the core conceptual phantasm fueling capital's engine, and a big,
big part of its generalized mystification of phenomena (i.e. ho
hum, ideology). It makes us want to buy deodorant and boss-logo
T-shirts that say "Don't buy the commodity for a day!," makes us
neurotic and alienated, even (when you trace it back) makes us desire
to post post after post in hopes that someone will buy what we have
to say and love us, oh, and welcome us, as if we belonged, into the
poetry store, and, ok, ok...

But, no, David, what it would be like to "see" this bottle
and book in front of me with a full apprehension of their
"substantiation" is certainly beyond me. We can never do that, and
that we can't is not just the matter of a "pure" epistemological
dilemma.

And I think the scent of this Cuban cigar made me say all that.
Kent

This poem is a big step forward for Michael Palmer. Using techniques
familiar to his fans, the interweaving "double staircase"/DNA-helices
structure found in a number of his earlier works, M.P. steps out of the
umbrous marges slap bang into the clearing. From what source, btw, was this
uncommonly pellucid poem retrieved?  David

Have it your way! The world is ugly and the people are sad!

The much-anticipated John Kinsella/Keston Sutherland reading at Poetry
City this Thursday has been postponed. Each poet will be at T&W next
spring. Don't neglect to come to New York for the Mark Statman/Michael
Morse reading Dec. 11 -- it's the annual Teachers & Writers holiday party,
and we'll be showing the much-wrinkled home movies of Larry Fagin, Lewis
Warsh, Anne Waldman, Bill Berkson, Bernadette Mayer, Ted Berrigan etc etc
etc.

So to sum up, no Po City this Thurs. Next Thurs, yes.

But why bother with all that high-tech hardware?  Things sure are changing
fast.  I was over at CVS yesterday to pick up some dental floss and
noticed that Colgate is offering something called Syntaxis Toothpaste -
with a thorough daily brushing your gums absorb a complete lexical
system based on a digitalized analog of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, and you
find yourself spouting poetry (& fresh breath, too!) very spontaneously.
No forethought required - just remember to brush regularly!

Folks,
Please pass this call on to anyone you think might be interested.
I've also attached a hard copy if you'd like to post it.
Thanks,

Editor, The Little Magazine

The Little Magazine  Announces  a  Call  for  Submissions
for a 1998 Hypermedia CD-ROM Issue

What we want:
Send us your experiments, your finished pieces in the following areas:

· web art and web based projects
· hypertexts: hyperpoetry & hyperfiction
· animations & digitized pieces
· sound texts and toys
· manifestos & theoretical work
· multimedia explorations (whatever isn’t covered above)

What are you doing? How are you doing it?
That’s what we want to know.

See our website at www.albany.edu/~litmag or The Little Magazine Vol 21 on CD-
ROM (1996) for what we’ve done in the past, and what we’d like to try.

Who we are:
Since 1965, The Little Magazine has been a literary journal devoted to
publishing fiction and poetry in experimental forms.  In 1995, we embraced our
own mission: we moved to the web and CD-ROM in order to explore and exploit
the nexus of opportunities that now exist between literature and media—how
literature, in effect, can benefit from emerging technologies. Above all, we
remain devoted to work of strong artistic merit which pushes its own limits:
to forms which writers and artists are now just starting to take advantage.

Deadlines:
Send submissions by February 1, 1998 to:

The Little Magazine                             or to: litmag@csc.albany.edu
University at Albany, SUNY
CD-ROM Issue
Albany, NY 12222

We prefer submissions on disk (PC/Mac) or via e-mail. Contact us re:
formatting and software questions.

The Little Magazine CD-ROM (1996) is available in bookstores. Or, send a
$15.00 check/money order to our above address.

just had a piece out in a journal called _symploke: a journal for the
intermingling of literary, cultural and theoretical scholarship_. it's me
at my most unabashedly over-the-top gushy, on the subject of "Jean Genet:
Passion In Memoria Aeterna."  i sort of can't believe i wrote it, it's so
too-too.

Bob, I don't know this piece. Could you tell me more?

But it would have to hold up to _Hamletmaschine_ by Mueller, wouldn't it?

"I was Hamlet.
I stood on the seashore and conversed with the surf BLA BLA BLA.
Behind me, the ruins of Europe."

and on we go!

or, act 2

"I am Ophelia. The one the river didn't keep. The woman dangling from the
rope. The woman with her arteries cut open."

or, act 3

"OPHELIA: Do you want to eat my heart, Hamlet?
HAMLET: I want to be a woman."

or, act 4

"JUST THE WORST TIME OF THE YEAR FOR A REVOLUTION
Cement in bloom walks through the slums
Doctor Zhivago weeps
For his wolves"

or

"I'm not Hamlet. I don't take part any more. My words have nothing to tell
me anymore."

or

"TV screens go black. Blood oozes from the refrierator. Three naked women:
Marx, Lenin, Mao. They speak simultaneously, each one n his own language,
the text: THE MAIN POINT IS TO OVERTHROW ALL EXISTING CONDITONS..."

or, act 5:

"This is Electra speaking. In the heart of darkness. Under the sun of
torture. To the capitals of the world. In the name of the victims."

Whew.

One theory has it Shakespeare was really William Stanley, hereditary ruler
of the Isle of Man (a manxman).  There is a small island off Man called
the "Calf" of man, which some kooks relate to the island setting of
the Tempest.  Caliban is called the "calf-man" (among other things...).

was WS really WS? The ante-WS?

only Jack Spandrift knows for sure.  they trimmed his tail a long time ago.

The best of this sort that I know is the first film version of Hamlet, shot
in Denmark in a think 1903. The plot is a melange of Shakespeare and Saxo
Grammaticus, with the wholly original element that Hamlet is played by a
woman pretending to be a man. Even Gertrude is apparently unaware of the
deception. When Hamlet receives her fatal wound Horatio opens her tunic to
check out the damage, revealing a breast. He looks up at the camera,
astonished. Cut to the title: "No wonder I've always been attracted to you!"
And of course there's always Dryden and Davenant's version of The Tempest
as scurrilous farce: they add a male equivalent of Miranda, a few noble
ladies to tempt his virtue, and a female Caliban. It's quite wonderful, but
it does feel like someone has scrawled graffitti on the sistine chapel.

Bob's referring to the play the New York School loved, a parody of
elizabethan blank verse drama (tho it is certainly an elizabethan blank
verse drama). I forget which mimeo press brought out a (facsimile) version
of the text.

To isolate the germ of amusement: Chronohotontologos's name takes up more
than half of a blank verse line.

Hey Simon Fraser U, don't they give you enough work to keep you occupied?
I mean, I liked GTR almost as much as I dug Giuffria or Ratt, but what's
with the hard-drinking lesly? and the note pad is straight outta Matt
Groening. But to speak tectonically: nice work, keep going.

Ok dok,

Just wanted to call the List's attention to some truly fine reviews by
Steven Marks in the latest ish of American Book Review. The poets whose
works are considered are Mark Wallace, Kristen Prevallet, Jefferson Hansen,
Wendy Battin and Jena Osman, the last two being reviews of the author's
poetry websites. Marks's concluding remarks about "learning new language
games" while too brief, are foresightful and provocative.

To Jefferson Hansen and Mark Wallace - can you please post info on how to
order your books?

Iroiro


The weather began to turn around the beginning of November. I dreamed
of fire, sparks flying in the night across the wooden houses. We were
jammed against the cemetary, bad luck in any season; Hokusai's ghosts
spoke across hideous red lanterns, their teeth waiting for the skin to
fall. Fukuoka was ruptured by uneasy presences; the foreign community
talked and talked, waiting for something to happen. Rumblings from
Eastern City penetrated Nine-States Island. These were the States at
that juncture:

State-of-Hand-Joined-to-the-Body
State-of-Being-Perfectly-Not-Here
State-of-Disconsolate-Thought-of-Wings
State-of-Hand-Not-Joined-to-the-Body
State-of-Beauty-Futon-Winter-Comfort
Electric-State-of-Coming-Wonders
State-of-Seeing-You-Around-About
Eighth-State-of-Fukuoka-City
State-of-Siege-of-Hardly-Kanji

Eastern City was in State-of-This-Main-Origin-of-Book, still spring, I
would say still April, the murmur of brook-larks heard high in Shinto
trees. For truth, I did not recognize talons where hands were joined,
words wired to electrical wonders not yet evidenced on the way from
Kyoto to Fuji, by way of Wheat-Rice-Island. Thinking of wings, I flew,
these were my thoughts:

Winged Thoughts, Iron Thoughts, Fire Thoughts, Singed Thoughts, River-
Water Thoughts, Electric-Coming-Wonder-Thoughts.

There were seven flowers, six elements, perfect nights. In Northern-
Nine-State-City, it was autumn, late-blooming chrysanthemum engraved
on lacquer-bone poet-box, crane-flight, swimming-turtle careful gold
design. I would write wonder-haiku,

one two sorrow five
six mountain eight pine ten e-   x
leven twelve autumn four-      x
                             ox oo
and win honor at go-moku, xxxxx o  in summer-Kurume, waiting near Wide
Island, very many tower down to Nagasaki. For to be sure, I was fast
disappearing. I dreamed of fire, sparks flying in the night. I dreamed
of wooden houses. I dreamed of shogi sets, the sound of game pieces
scraped across the wooden boards.

I dreamed of the fluttering of go boards, the sound of stone-and-shell
game pieces scraped across the hollow tables. I dreamed of mother-of-
pearl orderings from Eastern City, dreamed of the Origin of All Things,
dreamed of State-of-Siege.

christina:

caught your call for submissions on the poetics list. there was no
mention of formats or how many megs a submission can be.  personally Id
like to do something specifically for your project but wonder if you are
even interested in my work.  perhaps you could take a look at some of my
recent things & see what you think.  they are at:

Rosemary Ceravolo reads this list from time to time, so I'll not pretend

Small Press Traffic presents:


=46riday, December 5, 7:30 p.m.

Deanna Ferguson
Aaron Shurin

Deanna Ferguson is the author of _ddilemma, Rough Bush_ , and _The Relative
Minor_. She is one of the editors of Vancouver=B9s estimable _BOO Magazine_
and the small press Tsunami Editions. Oh, how I=B9ve schemed for years to
bring Deanna to Small Press Traffic, my fingers worn to the bone counting
the miles between B.C. and San Francisco. Her poetry is extremely dense and
yet inviting; it=B9s woven like a web of spidery filaments into a radar dish
of primitive and advanced sensation. Over the past few years I=B9ve watched
her reputation mount from a simmer to a full boil. It may be December but
this will be the hottest night of the year!

Aaron Shurin=B9s books of poetry include _Into Distances_ (Sun & Moon), _A's
Dream_ (O Books), and _The Graces_ (Four Seasons Foundation). Coming this
year: _A Door_ (Sun & Moon) and _The Paradise Of Forms: Selected Poems_
(Talisman House). His most recent book, _Unbound_ (Sun & Moon), is the most
affecting and splendid book yet written about AIDS, HIV and the place we
all live in now. He has won a NEA fellowship, a California Arts Council
fellowship, and the Gerbode Poetry Prize. He teaches at San Francisco State
University and the University of San Francisco.

=46riday, December 12, 7:30 p.m.

Dorothy Allison
Jewelle Gomez

The celebrated poet and novelist Dorothy Allison will come down to Small
Press Traffic for old times=B9 sake. If you have never seen her read, here=
=B9s
a chance to catch her in a rare intimate appearance. She is the most
spectacular reader I=B9ve ever seen. Maybe Jonathan Edwards in ye olde
Puritan days was better but I doubt it! She is the author of two books of
essays, _Skin_ and _Two or Three Things I Know for Sure_, a book of stories
_Trash_, a volume of poetry _The Women Who Hate Me_, and a novel, the
best-selling _Bastard Out of Carolina_ . Her new novel _Cave Dweller_ will
appear in March of 1998. Allison spent a lot of time in the small press San
=46rancisco writing scene before _Bastard_ catapulted her to fame, and she i=
s
one girl who has not forgotten her roots!

Jewelle Gomez is equally well-known for her forays into science fiction and
a painful, heartfelt realism (I=B9m looking forward to the spring publicatio=
n
of her new book of stories, _Don=B9t Explain_, the title story of which I
read first in _The Penguin Book of Lesbian Short Stories_). She is the
author of the groundbreaking novel _The Gilda Stories_, which was the
winner of two Lambda Literary Awards. She=B9s also published a collection of
essays, _Forty-Three Septembers_, and three books of poems, _The Lipstick
Papers, Flamingoes and Bears_, and the recent _The Oral Tradition_. Gomez
has been a poetry activist for many years in New York and now here, where
she works as the executive director of the Poetry Center at San Francisco
State.

If you want comments, all I can say is for ideas for similar works
you might try reading Chamberlain, Aston, Lafcadio Hearn and other
Orientalist writers
from a century ago. There you might get a better sense of how to tuck in
the condescending mishmash of nonsense that was made possible by colonial
domination or, in the case of Japan, which was not colonized, by military
superiority and unilateral imposition of unfair treaties.

Of course, you don't want to get too historical, lest thee lose sight of
the navelesque vision required for such in-sights.

Sorry, but take away the Orientalist pathos, there's not much left in this
piece.

Ever in search of beautiful human life,
dean

        Listfolk : somebody has sent me a file my software finds
indigestible. It's like watching a small python trying to swallow a large
pig. As a consequence, I will be unable (at least until monday, when my
server's office will be open & I can get expert advice) to access the
messages that are "behind" this monstrous file. I shall also have to
unsubscibe until things get fixed. Please be patient & I will get back to
you. If it is urgent, please phone me at 707-664-4209. Thanks. David

This a.m. @ 2 a.m. I have just completed a regen of all 20,000 (?) of le
EPC. So here's the scoop. This has been a massive regeneration of
header/body info/formatting. So for those who are vested ie. have author
pages or other interests in this layered intricate holy cow of pages ...
check pages that are important to you to make sure everything still looks
fine. Send a message to glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu with "Update Check" in the
subject of the message and "ok" in the body of the message (assuming all is
ok). I appreciate this. But I've just machine-interacted with these
thousands of files and want to make sure it all looks fine. The background
should now be white and the wording of the top links somewhat changed.
Quieter, calmer, cleaner. Thanks.

Folks,
(in particular David Bromige)

To all of you who may have had similar troubles downloading the grossly
overlarge attachment I sent with a Call for Submissions for the Little
Magazine earlier this week, my humblest humblest apologies.

It was an accident (I sent a non-shrunk attachment by mistake).
But an "oops" certainly doesn't cover it.

Again: my sincerest apologies.

Dean:

am I understanding you correctly? "Military superiority" of
the West and its "imposition of unfair treaties" on Japan
is the "historical" reason why Alan Myouka Sondheim's
letter  to Iroiro comes freighted with time-worn, unconscious traces
of Orientalist condescension? Obviously, any number of lands have
been so subjected by any mumber of other lands, and thus it would
seem that one could bid good-bye to a good deal of cross-cultural
imagining around the globe! Writers in Japan, citizens as they are of
a nation with a long and sordid imperialist history (a nation "not
colonized," as you put it), would not be the least compromised in
this regard.

I'm not suggesting that Orientalism is not an important issue. Of
course it is. But it seems to me that your last post is a good
example of its ideologically overzealous and simplistic application.
But I am aware that this is your academic field, and that I might be
wrong. Could you, then, illustrate your point by detailing, _with
some textual specificity_, why Sondheim's poem is as you have pegged
it to be? Here, at least, is a text you have read before making the
dismissal.

I'm sure I wasn't the only one on the list who found the piece rather
moving and exciting--certainly quite different in language and spirit
from the dusty works of the writers you rather preachily urge
Sondheim to school himself in. Obviously you think there is a
continuity between him and them and that we shouldn't have enjoyed
the poem? A close reading, please.

There is western orientalism and chinese orientalism:  for example, I am
currently working with some chinese ladies who consider the peoples of the
middle east to be oriental, and have fairly well-codified opinions of their
folkways.

1.  Does someone know what Hardy poem the phrase "original air-blue gown"
appears in?  I think it's called "The Visit," but I went through a Collected
Poems that didn't have an alphabetical title index, and couldn't find it.

2.  Can someone backchannel me an e-mail address for Steve Evans or Jennifer
Moxley?  I tried the one on the Impercipient letterhead, and it bounced.

3.  Just for discussion--what do people think about the following books/poets:
Campbell McGrath, -Spring Comes To Chicago-, and Joshua Clover, -Madonna
Anno Domini-?  Both books intrigue me: the first for its combination of
self-conscious 'plain-spokenness' and (seemingly) sophisticated economic
critique, the second as an example of the incursion of 'language-ish'
indeterminacy into a largely workshoppy framework.  I'm not sure that's a
criticism, but it's a curious twist.

From the web: can't say whether the layout is right . . .

     The Voice

     Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me,
     Saying that now you are not as you were
     When you had changed from the one who was all to me,
     But as at first, when our day was fair.

     Can it be you that I hear? Let me view you, then,
     Standing as when I drew near to the town
     Where you would wait for me: yes, as I knew you then,
     Even to the original air-blue gown!

     Or is it only the breeze, in its listlessness
     Travelling across the wet mead to me here,
     You being ever dissolved to wan wistlessness,
     Heard no more again far or near?

          Thus I; faltering forward,
          Leaves around me falling,
     Wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward,
          And the woman calling.

The latest news from my poetics/poetry/poets site is that things have
been dragging: not too many visits.  William Carlos Williams is leading
the vote for favorite all-time US poet but only has 10 votes; Ashbery
leads in the vote for favorite living poet with 8 votes; Ron Silliman,
Charles Bernstein, Lyn Hejinian, Susan Howe, Robert Creeley and Clark
Coolidge are tied for second with four, each.

There are now 33 bios on file and 23 poems.

And NOW AT LAST, what you've all been waiting for, my own FINAL
DEFINITIVE TAXONOMY OF VISIO-TEXTUAL POETRY!  It's now up at
Comprepoetica at:

      http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/1492/vispdef.html

It includes 9 examples of visio-textual art (a few not that effectively
reproduced but adequate for my purposes)--as well as a history of my
reasoning.  The terminology is klunky but the system itself seems pretty
airtight to me.  It's hard for me to believe that any genuine student of
visual poetry and related art could fail to get something out of it,
however many flaws he found with it.  Any comments, especially negative
ones, would be MOST welcome.  My poetics taxonomization is a nutty
life's work (although I DO have other life's works), but I'm serious
about it.  I hope it makes sense.

I've also have put some notes toward a taxonomy of literature up at
Comprepoetica. Important parts of these came out of discussions at UB
Poetics: the discussion of what to call gaps in lines of poetry helped
me much in defining poetry as having what I call flow-breaks (a slight
refinement on the old idea of poetry as that which is lineated); and
another discussion I don't think I even participated in, helped me work
out where narrative fits in, and what it is.  This second essay (very
dry, for specialists only, I would think) is at:

      http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/1492/lit-tax.html

Again, I'd greatly appreciate any comments, pro or con, especially the
latter.  For those who think taxonomy is stupid or even evil, I've put
up an intemperate rant in favor of it that will be sure to anger you at:

      http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/1492/taxdfens.html

Meanwhile, I'm still anxious for bios.  Come visit the site, fill out a
survey, leave a poem, vote for a favorite poet or two.  When
Comprepoetica takes over the world, I'll remember you, I promise!

History 101 for Kent Johnson:

You confuse the Japan that was a victim of imperialism (especially 1853-1900)
and the Japan that was a champion of imperialism (economic and military,
especially from the 1890s until the end of the War).

Maybe you should stick to imaginary people before you tackle the historical.

You confuse the Japan that was a victim of imperialism (especially 1853-1900)
and the Japan that was a champion of imperialism (economic and military,
especially from the 1890s until the end of the War).

Maybe you should stick to imaginary people before you tackle the historical.


Dear Dean:

Your response to Kent Johnson's post is qutite nasty. There is no doubt
that you are a genius in Japanese history.  Perhaps you can explain to us
how Japan was a vicitm of imperialism.  Are you talking culturally or in
practical everyday matters?  For instince, Tanazaki wrote about the
conflicts between the West and the East in his early novels.  Especially in
aesthetics, sexual mores, and in the difference between Japanese and
Western cultures.  Not everyone is exposed to different cultures.  It is
obvious that you are  truly a master in Japanese studies.  But don't look
down on people who are not familar with things outside their culture.

Please, pass on this text:
EDGARDO ANTONIO VIGO: Aspiration to Freedom

Clemente
Padin

Edgardo Antonio Vigo, aged 70, died in La Plata, the city of his birth.
Vigo was an engraver, experimental poet, conceptualist, constructor of
"objects-without-use" and "oddmachines," a constant innovator whose only
recently discovered work keeps on surprising, given the almost ineffable
character of his projects. He also cultivated forms that until now have
been considered sub-artistic or simply not thought of as "art" in the
vernacular sense of the term, such as mail art and experimental poetry.

In Vigo's work can be seen influences of Marcel Duchamp-we recall Vigo's
film Blanco sobre Blanco (White on White), shown on the spectators' backs,
and the "ready-mades" he constantly sent his friends-and, above all, of
Macedonio Fernandez, not only in his irreverent attitude but also in his
long and contradictory titles and paratexts. From both, Vigo took the ludic
attitude of play, making the spectators participate and desacralizing the
work of art through manipulation and co-creation, to the point that he
preferred to speak of the "creative-constructor" instead of the "spectator,"
trying to make of artistic creation a multiple act, not something individual
and solitary.

Born in La Plata in 1927, Vigo enrolled in the School of Fine Arts of the
La Plata University in 1950 and, in 1953, he went on a scholarship to
France where he met the Venezuelan artist Jesus Soto and came into contact
with the international avant-garde. In 1954, on returning to his country,
Vigo exhibited wooden objects that already foretold his later tendency
towards an art of popular participation. He was an important magazine
editor, publishing Diagonal Cero (1961) and Hexagono 70, which featured
"novisima" poetry-what he liked to call visual poetry-together with the
subsequent Nuestro Libro Internacional de Estampillas y Matasellos (Our
International Book of Stamps and Postmarks) with original stamps and
postmarks by artists from around the world (artistamps and rubber stamps).
These are considered paradigmatic of what is known today as "artists'
books." In 1965 Vigo exhibited his first "useless machines," such as the
Palanganometro Mecedor para Criticos de Arte (Palaganometer
Rocking Chair for Art Critics) and the Bi-Tri-Cicleta Ingenua
(Ingenuous Bi-Tri-Cycle) that was heaped with vernacular criticism,
initiating a long silence that lasted until the 1990s. But, the alternative
scene in France, 1967, published his Poemas Matematicos Barrocos
(Mathematical Baroque Poems) and the next year his Poemas Matematicos
Incomestibles (Mathematical Inedible Poems) (an object enclosedbetween two
empty tuna cans soldered together). Also, in 1968, in La Plata there
appeared his first traffic light, Manojo de Semaforos (Bunch of Traffic
Lights). This consisted of analyzing from the aesthetic and creative point
of view the traffic signals located in the intersection of First and
Sixtieth Avenues in La Plata. Presenting an anonymous and useless element in
its specific function (stressing an ironic urban commentary) this project
sought to initiate a specific dialogue with an abstract content. The public
invited to participate were to develop their ideas using the minimal keys
given by the artist, who wasn't there. The proposal was to subtract out all
prejudicial contact in order to generate an action in freedom.

In issue 11 of the magazine Los Huevos del Plata (1968) there appeared
Vigo's New Avant-Garde Poetry in Argentina and experimental poems by Jorge
de Luxan, Carlos Ginzburg, Luis Pazos, and his own. Here is found
the second break with the lyric tradition in Argentina (the first was in the
1930s, under the sign of Ultraism).

From the mid-60s, Vigo was a proponent of conceptualist tendencies in Latin
America, above all the Conceptualism applied to undoing the mechanisms and
instrumentation of the work of art and its relation to its spectators, not
the Conceptualism of Kosuth's "Art is the definition of art." Vigo
emphasized the
self-referential qualities of the work that not only promoted ambiguity (the
possibility of extreme polysemy) but also the possibility of the choice of
the spectator in the final selection of meaning, causing him to be
considered as co-author of the work itself. Vigo's project in this sense was
crystallized in Poetry to and/or Realize, through which he tried to get the
spectator to participate in the "constructive activation with which it is
possible for the consumer to pass over to the category of creator"  (From
Process Poetry to Poetry to and/or Realize, Diagonal Zero, La Plata, 1970).
Vigo continued with the I Expo de Proposiciones a Realizar (I Expo of
Propositions to Realize) in 1971, which took place in the Cayc, Centro de
Arte y Comunicacion (Art and Communication Center) of Buenos Aires, where,
together with works received from all around the world, were brought
together the artists Wlademir Dias-Pino (creator of Brazilian Process/Poem),
Guillermo Deisler (the late Chilean visual poet), and the Uruguayans
Francisco Accame (musician and sound poet), and myself.

On one of his first visits to our country, Vigo realized-during the
"Exhibition of Avant-Garde Publications" organized by the magazine OVUM 10
in the Hall of the University of the Republic on September 30, 1970, the
proposal "Demagogic Poem," a parody of the election process. Votes were cast
in an urn with a round opening. The ballots were nothing but forms
distributed by the performer in which the participant-creator was asked to
express whatever he wanted, and then Vigo put the ballots, not folded but
rolled up in the form of cylinders, into the special container.

At the beginning of the 1970s, Vigo joined the new currents of mail art,
becoming one of its most regular creators until the day of his death. The
military dictatorship of his country struck hard, causing one of his sons
to disappear. Because of this disgraceful act, Vigo's work took on a
strongly political character such that his contacts with foreigners were
augmented, spreading the word about the brutal repression and crimes
against humanity of this ferocious dictatorship. From this period came his
work Trelew (1974), in memory of the 16 revolutionaries assassinated in the
Trelew jail in southern Argentina on August 22, 1972. On each page of the
book is a representation of each fallen body. From those sad moments Vigo
lent his talent to the mobilizations of the "Mothers of the Plaza of May"
(his collective visual poem "Sembrar la memoria" [To Seed Memory] was
emblematic, realized in the large popular event "Everyone or No One" that
the group "Ezcombros" organized in La Plata on December 9, 1995). In his
last years, Vigo's work turned towards the light; he exhibited individually
in the Tan Telmo Foundation (1991), where  he had a retrospective show of
his major works. In 1994, he was selected to form the Argentine section to
the XXII Biennial of Sao Paulo, Brazil, thereby achieving world recognition
in this area.

To conclude, allow me to include these words of Vigo's taken from his
public declaration of 1968,"An Art to Realize," that will give us a more
accurate idea of his project:

"Towards a touchable art that breaks in the artist the possibility of the
use of "rotten" materials to the extreme that they produce the alienation
of the hand of the observer -simple form of perception- that will stay in
this position without the "epidermal" participation of the thing. Through
use of "base" materials and for a delimiting quotidian context of the
content. A touchable art that rejects the possibility of satisfying an
"elite" that the artist has been forming to his regret, a touchable art that
can be located in any home and not enclosed in Museums and Galleries.
An art with mistakes that alienates the exquisite. Taking advantage to the
maximum of the aesthetic of "surprise," through "occurrence" -primary act of
creation- to be converted -already in for the masses form- into involving
movements or for individuality congruence of intentionality-, in attitude.
An art of expansion, of atrape for the ludic way, that facilitates active
participation of the spectator, the absurd way. An art of signaling so that
the quotidian escapes  to the unique possibility of the functional. No more
contemplation without action. No more exhibition without presentation.
Where inert material, stable and fixed, takes its movement and necessary
change so that the image is constantly modified. Finally: a contradictory art."

Only with some difficulty have I been able to touch on all or even some of
the facets and dimensions of this indefatigable creator, barely able
schematically to redeem Vigo's attitude towards art and the society in
which he lived and suffered. This artist subjected himself only to his own
rules. All his life he was guided by ideas having to do with freedom. His
work will last as long as there exists in people this desire for liberty
that he tried to keep fresh by confronting the split of choosing between
the various possibilities of signification (including that of altering
meaning) that his works offered, thereby concretizing through that choice
our deepest nature: the aspiration to freedom.

I'm curious as well about my Orientalism - is it because of the ma/mu gaps
- my use of "iroiro" ("various") or local color mixing prints with
the def. of Kyushu? or the fact that there's no correlation between our
place in Hakata-ku and anything extruded in the text? Perhaps it's in the
fact that I haven't understood the Tale of Genji correctly? Or read it in
the wrong translation? (I didn't read it; I lied.) Perhaps it's in the
florid language which goes nowhere, deliberately? I should have mentioned
imperialism (long bow) but thought that shogi's origins in India and China
were sufficient...

I bow corrected.

Re orientalism, I respect the need not to blindly appropriate others'
cultural baggage--the rich-hippies-in-"sweat lodges" phenomenon is a prime
example--but I do wonder where the Line of Okay gets drawn. Like, I
practice a Japanese form of Buddhism, and I like to read haiku and waka
and tanka and renga and suchlike, and I adore sushi, but am nonetheless
willing to concede that Japan's conformity principle is scary, its
non-electronic consumer products can be cheesy, and its pizza is terrible.
Is it okay to like Basho if you don't decorate your Stateside apartment in
tatami? Wondering.

Dean:
Why do you assume I confuse anything? I said Japan had a long history
of imperialism. But I don't doubt you know much more about Japan's
history than I do. I would hope, since this is your advanced academic
field, that you do!

But is this reply the best you can do? I asked you, out of sincere
curiosity, to provide a close reading of Sondheim's poem so as to
give evidence for your sarcastic attack on its "Orientalism." I
thought this would be a good thing, since you have used this loaded
term as a club in a number of posts to dismiss, censure, and insult.
And you have done this with little or no textual evidence or support
to justify your rebukes. (In fact, you have yourself admitted, in
attacking two projects that I have been involved in, that you haven't
even read what you are attacking!)

So once more: Here's your chance to go beyond jargon-slinging.
Orientalism is a heavy and fascinating issue. Combine your knowledge
of history with a close analysis of the poem in question, and show us
_why_ you think as you do.

primitive publications is 1706 U Street NW #102, Washington, D.C. 20009.

        The cost of individual books from primitive is $4. Mary may be
giving deals on complete sets. I don't know. She has also published books
by Jeff Hansen, Sherry Brennan, Kristin Prevallet, and a fine chapbook of
her own.

        In the meantime, the best e-mail address at which to reach Mary is
currently hiltonm@aiamail.aia.org   The e-mail address which Steven Marks
mentioned is still functional, but she seems to check it less often.

        Mary is doing a wonderful production job on these chapbooks,
and I hope you'll support her project.

But Dean Brink you still don't address the issue of textual specificity
that Kenneth raises.  I think rather than shaming us whose Japanese
history fails your test of adequacy, it would help to have some
pointers.

Dean:

It is because what we say is unfinished, always, that we can say
without fear. The gatekeepers themselves, in speaking back law, say
only what they have been given to say by signs. It is always
unfinished. Thinking of this I gathered courage, making prostrations.
The land to the East or West of us is there because we are here,
speaking of it. (My sister wrote that.)

Anyway, when I arrived at the first gate, I was told I could not
pass. The guards were dressed in coats of black scales, with
half-moons of gold covering their mouths. They spoke in tongues from
the West and told me to return there. Beyond their head-sets, sparks
flew in the night across the wooden houses, and I imagined that those
of the foreign community inside were shimmering and transparent
so that their bones mingled as one with the tea-fires and the frozen
flight of the cranes. (Awkward, but I am writing quickly here.) And
then, by magic, Dean, the Western Guards became tethered to long and
shiny poles of discourse (though it was dark and I couldn't quite
see) and were spun round and round so that a breeze lightly scented
with bream and salt cooled my face. I smashed the turtle's shell and
passed boldly through the gate.

You see, it was the thought of Witter Bynner that led me on. I
desired my dust to be mingled with his, forever and forever and
forever. I also thought of the following things, though I would never
dare to speak them openly:

The State of Hand Not Joined to Body
The State of Being Perfectly Not Here
The State of Disconsolate Thought of Wings
The State of Myouka Writing "Hand Not Joined to Body"
The State of Rose of the Snow Kimono
The State of Poem Written on Throat of Turtle
The State of Shikantaza as Loving Cunt Enfolding
The State of Kissing Son on Loving Lips
The State of Sons as Suicidal Aviators Exultant
The State of Being a Staff or Whisk
The State of Stillness in Self-Fulfilling Samadhi
The State Where the Moon Swallowing Is Brought Forth

Weary, I took a piss, making great steam in the Autumn grasses. Then,
preparing ink on a large stone, I wrote:

[xx] shungyo ya hito koso shirane kigi-no ame [xx]
Which I choose to translate thus:
[mourning his son he crosses the hills with a large sack of eggs]

When I arrived at the second gate it was May, and all was in the
State of Three Heads and Eight Arms as Rain on the Trees. The guard
of this gate had the corpulent face and body of Amida, but I knew
that was just a disguise. He spoke in hoarse whispers and in a
language I could only understand by imagining. He told me to display
wares in my laquer-bone-poet-box, and I did so. He told me to
ornately describe the Eastern Suburbs with their alleys full of
squatting whores and peddlars, and I did this. He told me to squat
thusly and shit in my beggar's hat and I did so. He told me to write
one wonder-haiku on cicada husk's soundless cry, and I did this, his
sword suspended in threat above.  I wrote:

Towa x ni x ikitashi x onna-no x koe x to x semi-no x ne x to
Which I choose to translate thus:
[my soul passes through those of others: hydragena exhibit]

Thus, this apparition vanished, and I went deeper into the mandala,
having no idea where I was headed (and admittedly half-wishing I had
heeded the cautionary advice of my grad school advisors).  Wide-eyed,
I witnessed:

The Room of Looking through a Bamboo Tube
The Room of Scholars Who Count Letters
The Room of Poets with Strings of Law Leading Back to Their Names
The Room of the Theory of Five Ranks
The Room of Mud Within Mud
The Room of Merely Being "In the Mountains"
The Room of Oneness Within Differentiation
The Room of Udumbara in Shameless Flower
The Room of "Life Streams Issue from Plum Blossoms"
The Room of Everyday Rice-Eating Activity
The Room of Sky with Palms Together
The Room of Mind Moon Alone and Full

I felt fear and trembling, I felt the insistent repetition of all
phenomenal things, I felt an anxiety and dread of concepts that
verged (is it possible to say it?) on the irony of Being itself, and
I felt a sickness unto death. You see, Dean, I had come to
the gate through which the masts of Foreign Ships are visible! It was
like a forest after a great fire, or a city of people who have been
burned to a crust but are still standing. And I realized that this
was the Room of No Turning Back.

The guard here was dressed in elegant suit. He both was and was not
(if you can imagine that!), like the brittle sumi-e I had seen at
Eihei-ji: a single Not-Thinking stroke bringing sudden form out of
no-form. He appeared to me as an American executive from Toshiba, and
he brandished a scroll of unfair treaties, all inscribed in the most
delicate calligraphy. He said I could pass only should I beat him in
Poetry-Duel-to-Death. "I go first," he growled, "and my poem is
titled 'State of Siege.'" He read in rapid-fire bursts, his voice
screeching as ten-thousand shikirichi, and through the great roar of
rushing waters' sound, this is what I heard:

shaving dace [...] now stomping [.........]
town wall [....] place for gossip or [...]
[.......]daughter's dream--silkworm dealers?[.......]but[..]
But [......]market flooded. Why Pentium Chips if
[............]waving fan--clay stove [..]
[................] so [.....................] no, [................]
Ah, Hiroshima's blessing [...] fast track is [.......] better and
[.] for one thousand vats of nightsoil [.................] but legs
spread for love-making [.........] while far away [.......]
geisha expert [...] quick web-search for [..........]
thirty seven Mexicans suffocated in freight car clawing eyes out
[...............................................................]

I was fearful and trembled at his fierce visage. A device for
measuring time glowed with Oriental splendour on his wrist. Sparks
flew in the night across the great wooden ships beyond. I knew now
the foreigners had been waiting there, shimmering and transparent,
for thousands and thousands of Springs. I dipped my brush and raised
it slowly back, knowing death-poem in my bones, knowing the darkness
there in the glistening point of it... And I wrote:

xHyakuxxxsen-noxxxdokanxxitsumademoxxxxwarauxxxkareno-nox
Which is untranslatable thus:
[                                                                  ]


                                    ---------------------------

And when I woke, drenched from the dream, it was my teacher, serene
in Electric State of Coming Wonders, speaking to us in measured and
instructional tones. And this is what I heard:

"This paradox cannot be mediated, for it depends specifically on
this: In attachment blossoms fall, and in aversion weeds spread. The
single individual is only the single individual. As [inaudible] as
this single individual wants to express his absolute duty in the
universal, becomes conscious of it in the universal, he recognizes
that he is involved in a spiritual trial. [extended inaudible
section] Do not be limited to the narrow views held by human beings.
Even where there is no sun and moon, there is day and night."
(I taped that.)

He was a monk from Japan. He was vegetarian and ate his rice and
things with chopsticks. And I spoke every Orientalist dream that
came to me that sesshin, into the black hole of his succulent, papery
ear.

Poets-in-residence are turning up in new places thanks to a 450,000 stg
National Lottery grant to the UK's Poetry Society, according to an article
in today's Financial Times. Peter Sansom has been appointed resident poet
at Marks and Spencer, a British chain.  Lavinia Greenlaw has taken a
similar (though not funded by the lottery)  appointment at the law firm
Mishcon de Reya, at a salary of 10,000 stg a year. Marks & Spencer does
not intend for the sales staff to reply to customers in verse, but they do
hope to encourage the "creative side of [their] people".

antibiotics anyone?

I enter where I have no business, but so be it. Perhaps what some find
offensive is their familiar world being transformed by those to whom it is
less familiar into a kind of science fiction (perhaps they feel that the
daily lives of others are too available at this juncture to be treated
without irony as exotica.) For myself the familiar so transforms itself
often enough to keep me busy.

Doubled Flowering

>From the Notebooks of Araki Yasusada

 The materials of the Japanese poet Araki Yasusada (1907-1972), a
 survivor of Hiroshima, were published in Grand Street, Conjunctions,
 Abiko Quarterly, First Intensity, Stand, and The American Poetry
 Review. Gradually the rumor began circulating that Araki Yasusada did
not
 exist and that the poems were a "hoax" perpetrated by the
Japanese-American
 author Tosa Motokiyu or by his literary executor, the American poet
Kent
 Johnson.  On August 9th, 1997, Asahi Shimbun, Japan's leading
newspaper,
 published a front page story on Araki Yasusada, accompanied by his
apocryphal penciled portrait. The article, along with a subsequent
feature story in
 the Asahi, has made Yasusada an emerging literary sensation in Japan.
 Indeed, no other poetry in English in recent memory has provoked such
 wide-ranging international discussion and controversy before book
 publication. In major publications in the U.S., England, Australia,
 Mexico, Russia, Spain, Israel, and Italy, poets and critics have
 expressed excitement, hostility, and bewilderment toward Yasusada's
 idiosyncratic work. They have judged it as everything from a "racist
 inspired hoax" to an "imaginative gesture of profound beauty and
 empathy."
 Presented here for the first time in complete form, readers now have
the
 chance to draw their own conclusions about Doubled Flowering and-if
they
 read with understanding and care-to perhaps gain access to the
mysteries
 of its origins.

 Critical Acclaim for Araki Yasusada

 "'Yasusasa's' writing is an entry into a spiritual space . . . It is a
 work of art in the largest sense."     - Carolyn Forche

 "The 'scandal' of these poems lies not in the problematics of
 authorship, identity, persona, race or history. Rather, these are
 wonderful works of writing that also invoke all of these other issues,
 never relying on them to prop up a text. In a time and place where
 book jacket blurbs routinely claim that X or Y poet has written a work
that
 has "found that which is essential" in whatever, this book makes the
 argument for anti-essentialism. That it has done it so well infuriates
 folks with a proprietary interest in categories. Thank you, Araki
 Yasusada!" -Ron Silliman

 "Knowing its fictitious nature, with a slight sense of disgust, I find
 Yasusada's poetry evil, and eerily beautiful." - Hosea Hirata,
 Assistant Professor of Japanese Literature, Tufts University

 "Having edited the volume Atomic Ghost: Poets Respond to the Nuclear
 Age and having read a great deal of poetry on Hiroshima, both by
hibakusha
 and non-hibakusha, I find Yasusada's 'Mad Daughter and Big-Bang'
 simply
 one of the most moving and revealing poems ever written on the effects
 of the Bomb. If we ignore the strange and wonderful writing we find in
 this book, future readers may judge the real fraud not Yasusada, but
 us." -John Bradley

 "(The Yasusada author) has done a brilliant job in inventing a world
 at once ritualized and yet startlingly modern, timeless yet
documentary,
 archaicized yet au courant--a poetic world that satisfies our hunger
 for the authentic, even though that authentic world is itself a perfect
 simulacrum. . . . Like Pound's Homage to Sextus Propertius, the
 Yasusada notebooks force us to go back to the 'originals,' so as to see
what
 they really were and how they have been transformed." -Marjorie
Perloff,
 Professor of Comparative Literature, Stanford University

 "(It is) a mistake, I think, in having 'Kent Johnson' stand for the
 author. He/She/They should be known as the Yasusada Author, much as we
 refer to a Renaissance painter as the Master of the X Altar. . . .
 (Yasusada) is both the greatest poet of Hiroshima and its most
 unreliable witness."-Eliot Weinberger, Boston Review &  The Village
Voice

 "Yasusada's manuscripts have attracted wide attention. Among the
 readers is included a poet who confessed that he was so moved that he
"could
 not sleep." . . . Whether Yasusada's fictional texts are worth
appraisal
 as that which expresses a desire for a union with the victims of the
 atomic bombs, or whether they are a beautiful but superficial
composition
 which evades the issues of responsibility and guilt, one cannot find
any
 sort of agreement among poets and critics in American circles. . . . In
the
 wariness not unlike that of evading a taboo, one might feel an
ripples of this scandal will reach further. One could not overlook then
 how the discussion will develop, particularly on the relation between

A Radical Reading
of Chinese Poetry
by Yunte Huang

This book is not an attempt to grasp the "essence" of Chinese poetry,
nor is it an endeavor to produce an over-polished version of English
that claims aesthetic superiority over other works in the same field. It
grapples rather with the nature of translation and poetry, and explores
poetic issues from the perspective of translation and translation issues
from the perspective of poetry. With its agenda hidden, translation is
too often the handyman for the metaphysical, mystical, or universal
notion of poetry. When emerging from obscurity, translation becomes an
ally with poetic material and enacts the wordness of the words. This
book strives to strengthen the alliance between translation and poetry.

"In this anthology of classic poetry from China, Yunte Huang transforms
our sense of "Chineseness" by replacing the Orientalized scenic and
stylistic tropes of traditional translations with multilevel encounters
with the Chinese language. In acknowledging the foreigness of its source
texts, this collection reimagines the task of translation and the
possibilities for crosscultural points of contacts, in the process
changing the way we read Chinese poetry."          -- Charles Bernstein,
SUNY Buffalo

"Yunte Huang has created an intersting mode halfway between a
hermeneutical cartography and a translation; this, to test and expand
the reader's horizon of expectation."

It also depends on what is familiar. I am writing from the position of
being a gaijin, so what is familiar is also unfamiliar and vice versa.
It's not exotica for me, nor is it alien, nor is it not exotica, nor is it
not alien.

It is similar to a situation expressed in Quebecois literature all the way
back through Chamberland, but here there is a differentiation between else
and other based on language and entrance.

I might add that Japanese writers write about and/or "American" as well,
without PC censors around; I might also add that perhaps imperialisms have
to be deconstructed here, as well as colonialisms in regard to these
"nations" among others, but then again I am no expert on American history
either.

Such literal imitations ringing of earlier imitations of haibun do not go
too far beyond what is called in Japanese "direct translation style"
(chokuyakutai). There are possibilities here that you may be able to
polish into something more interesting and in tune with both what haibun
writers have been doing and what might be done. I would love to see the
genre developed in English - it is far more interesting than haiku,
because it doesn't so easly let the reader forget the context, which I
think is important to the appreciation of most Japanese poetry. In
English haiku have been presented as floating snippets of consciousness
along the Way. In haibun the haiku means much more than a pithy breath
unit.

But as it stands, even if we were to put aside the "defense of
Orientalism" rhetoric framing your piece,
there are so many issues regarding the application of genres and voices,
it would seem hard to overcome
the 'pathos for feeling deeply' that is so overdramatized in Western
emulations and so beautiful in
Classical Japanese poetry, i.e. waka (modern Japanese poetry is another
can of genres).

I guess it is just such a "let's be pathetic" all around and "I'm okay,
you're okay" in a great circle
that doesn't work too well in much Orientalist writing in America. The
problem is that Anglo-American poetry continues to locate Asia or Asian
cultures as a Shangri-La of inspiration, a safe haven for the Muses
driven out by the Enlightenment from Parnassus. The inspiration is often
very sweet and sometimes mushy; the pathos is presented (and defended) as
a form of antiIntellectualism that sings spiritual truths in its own way
by right of irrationality (which I can respect). It can seem to seek to
push itself on the reader like a child writing for mommy and shaking on
an apron. This is where the Orientalist pathos at least seems to go.
Maybe all poetry is an apron thing.

What makes me cringe at (Orientalist) poetry is how it confuses
historical escape with the literary (in the old-fashioned New Critical
sense to boot). Such work only waters down the intensity of poetry and
its cultural life (semiotic, discursive, peripheral...), relies on tropes
of ambiguity and diffusion. In the long haul, we need more than
distraction in poetry. Isn't that the idea of it: It seems that poetry
that so deliberately pursues the ahistorical is like a sculptor of
abstract human figures who does not know the feeling of others' bodies.
Poetry is intimately ideological. Poetry with historical shells (cf.
Hokusai's ghost) runs away from the problem of our context here and seeks
to import one for inspirational nourishment. Fine, but it is not easy to
graft traditions; it can be done.
Becoming somewhat familiar with how this process occurred in 19 th
century Japan with Western culture and poetry in particular, I would be
happy to share my research. I think that more research on Japanese poetic
discourse will help show how American imitations display shortcomings in
terms of understanding the breadth of Japanese cultures (not all courtly
or sacerdotal) and more developed understanding of Japanese
rhetoric/poetics (this is no one's fault but mine - I'd be happy to
develop my work on this if there is an interest in it).

Japanese poetry is not all good-natured (plenty of back-stabbing,
sarcasm, and puns, many of these as political attacks)... is not all
jovial, Buddha-nature-bearing childishly innocent (=truth  = no mind =
constant nothing) Way, and of course, very very few Japanese poems have a
flying chance of alluding to "the sound of one hand swatting the frog
into water: bleep" poetic that gets so much mileage.

One more item:

Weary, I took a piss, making great steam in the Autumn grasses. Then,
  preparing ink on a large stone, I wrote:

I really like this image, movement; however the diction does smack of the
archaic ("Weary" [why not "tired"]) and of direct translation of Japanese
or Chinese ("great"), and that is what can be called "playing the
Orientalist card." If we really have respect for Asian cultures, the
least we can do is not stereotype the language used in association with
them (Buddhism, haibun, etc.). This is the legacy of bad translations and
imitations (cf. the common use of "Chinatown," and the obsolete
"Chinaman" - when used, were these celebrating Chinese culture or
alienating and cordoning it off from the mainstream?). Similar issues
exist today, just as obvious if you look for them.

Except that it is precisely _not_ about feeling deeply but about sur-
faces. Nor is it a defense of Orientalism; this is your charge - Orien-
talism - and therefore you create a Lyotardian differend here - to respond
or not to respond. I have no thought except you misunderstood this, and
probably the Fukuoka novel I wrote (which includes llamas) and sent to the
list - not to mention the Jennifer/Julu materials.

These are fictions in a deeper sense - not pathos in a deeper sense - not
feelings in a deeper sense - than you give credit for..

Except again that I am not espousing spiritual truths, and this work is
connected with the other Clara-pieces ("Novel," and earlier stuff going
back to Disorders of the Real).

My own thinking is the opposite; Japanese work off of Disneyland and all
sorts of Amerikan-cultural objects/aspects here without a problem. Now do
you call this Occidentalism, critique it the same way? I think that Japan,
whatever, must be precious for you, untouchable - that any referencing is
seen as an invasion. That it's _your_ territory.

By the way since Said's book at the least, I don't know the reference to
"Orientalist" which needs deconstruction as well, or am I missing some-
thing here?

This is an entirely different issue. I have used tropes of ambiguity and
diffusion and for that matter so have Derrida and Jabes. Or do you find
"Oriental poetry" whatever that is, full of them?

I _like_ diffusion in poetry, the spread of the word into the field,
blahblah. (Blahblah reminds me so does Heiner Muller - it's not just a
one-way street.)

Hokusai's ghost is less a shell if you live next to a cemetary here, which
I do. But of course it's easier for an "Orientalist" to prejudge.

And "deliberately pursues the ahistorical" - no - just _might be_ a-hist-
orical. Such as language poetry. I remember Clark Coolidge referencing the
deaths of some spelunkers in Flag Flutter... He didn't know them - all the
way from another state. Is that ok?

Fine, but it is not easy to
> graft traditions; it can be done.

Except I'm not "grafting traditions." Using a haiku for an english number
count critiques haiku, inserting words of english-trite-haiku in the midst
to point that out, go-moku as a scatter across it, since gaijin can at
best play that without much skill.

There is an interest in it from this party at least, but not in relation
to my work being called "American imitations," since again I feel you are
totally missing the point. You read my material as "Orientalist" and then
proceed to build upon this imaginary model (which holds almost nowhere
today).

I think this goes without saying. Nor is all Japanese poetry Buddhist. Nor
does all Japanese poetry ignore Western models and subject matters. But of
course that is a matter for Occidentalists to critique and misunderstand.

Just want to point out you might on the other hand see these lines work-
ing off of past Japanista translations, not off of contemporary Japan.
"Weary" works fine in either case; "great" would reference other mis-
recognitions among those who considered themselves literalists.

But of course if you hold to the purity of Japan, you are completely
correct, and one _must_ use colloquial Americanisms (not English) as well.

There's some smoke and mirrors here. I'll say my piece as clearly as I can,
then I'm outa this. I don't give a damn about the political ramifications
of what you do. You can write as whatever you want--we call that fiction.
But it raises questions when the details of place and time are lifted from
a turn-of-the-century japonisme that would have been acceptable in an
edwardian interior decorator or, say, in the Mahler (actually chinoiserie)
of Das Lied, or even Gilbert and Sullivan--they didn't know any better--the
orient was unfamiliar enough to be a stand-in for never-never land. The
daily lives of Japanese people, and their own view of their past, is
everywhere accessible to us, whether in news reports, japanese fiction,
films, what have you--they have their own voices, and it takes a willful
blindness nowadays not to hear them. That's why the foreign as decorative
element can appear, as I think it does in your latest attempt, merely
decorative, which is certainly taking another culture rather lightly. If
you're going to write from a japanese persona, in other words, you might
want to be a bit more rigorous with yourself.

This is also my last comment here. I am _not_ writing from the viewpoint
of a japanese persona, 1. as was pointed out ; and 2. where do you ever
get the idea that the daily life etc. is everywhere accessible to us, when
in fact translations are heavily english to japanese and very little the
other way around?

As far as "lifted," I've "lifted" Hokusai for about 30 years now in any
case. I've also "lifted" Lautreamont who unfortunately is also last
century.

As far as lightweight goes, of course. I can't argue with this.

Well, I feel I have been sufficiently
chastened and it makes me sick to my stomach.
So see, it's ok to write out of Lautreamont
or take say Gertrude Stein apart (yes, I've
spoofed her and it's in archives now), but
God forbid we touch other cultures because
after all they're precious and we should only
work out of contemporary otherness, or maybe
not even that. So I will watch my words care-
fully on this list, as far as the politics go,
I didn't give a fuck about them but brought them
up in response to Dean and you, see? But it's
clear now, what's acceptable to the poetics
community and I stand corrected.

No more of this fucking shit will pass your way!

This is all fascinating stuff and pretty complex. eh? More complex
than the great suspended sword of "Orientalism," which kind of makes
everyone shut-up and mind their manners at the table... But good on
Dean Brink for the thoughtful reply, and wow to gaijin Sondheim, who

Just a quick question before running to class: Mark Wallace wrote--
"If you're going to write from a Japanese persona, in other words,
you might want to be a bit more rigorous with yourself."

The wild irony of calling on Sondheim to be "more rigorous" with
himself aside, this raises an interesting question, at least for me:
Wouldn't being "more rigorous" in this context perhaps mean, in part,
a deconstruction of essences--an effort toward a showing of the
Western in the Eastern, and vice-versa, and the fascinating
complications, paradoxes, and poetic propellants such volatile
mixtures create? I ask, because infamous Japanese persona Yasusada
has been lambasted _both_ for being essentialist in an Orientalist
way (see Dean's earlier posts, for example) and for his obvious and
shameful corruptions of Japanese cultural and poetic conventions. It
would seem (or am I wrong--_how should_ one do it, Mark?) that when
it comes to inhabiting a cross-cultural persona--or having that
persona inhabit you--that you (plural) just can't win.

I hate to see this kind of cultural censorship done in the name of patronage
and preservation of social/cultural realism.

Alan, I hope you still feel that you can do whatever you like here: you can
spoof, deconstruct, empathize with no one in particular, get in and out of the
crossed-up cultural, be willfully blind, willfully take another culture
lightly, take exception to poetry as "intimately ideological," decorate the
foreign, foreignize the decorative, be rather nonintimately ideo-logical, but
whatever you do, don't be rigorous with yourself!

The tasteful and intellectual nomination of culture is whimsical in itself.

We still need distraction. This especially from the boring, authorized pc
representations of culture that only serve as useful for a short time (until
the wheels fall of of the bandwagon).

Someone backchanelled me re my posting about this poem, & made me realize I
was putting a great deal on a reader of my post, to arrive at my intention
for it. So, to clarify : I believed the poem to be a parody of a Michael
Palmer poem (the "MP" threw me that notion, and the techniques employed in
the poem supported it), and I thought that I was at once going along with
this parody (it _was_ funny, to imagine that Michael Palmer might have
written it ; the mixture of likeliness and unlikeliness is appealing, as in
one of his "False Portrait" poems, like the notion that I share traits with
Pagannini) _and_ calling its author, "O, sure, sure, _that's_ an MP poem?"
At no time did I think it _was_, and at no time would I think it was a "big
step forward" for the poet of "Ecolalia". But some of the poems in "At
Passages" disclose a more demotic flatness of surface than before,
therefore it was just barely likely and thus, I thought, a skilful parody.
All that aside, now I know it is the work of the MP called Mark Peters, I
congratulate him on a striking poem that can certainly stand on its own. I
look forward to reading more of his work, and I thank Kenneth Goldsmith for
bringing it to our attention. David

Whileeading your post I felt a sudden rush of power: I could say anything I
want and Mark Wallace would have to answer for it! Like Claude Rains in the
invisible man. But I thought better of it. Wallace has enough
responsibilities, and he bears the same last name as my favorite prof from
college. 'Twas I killed cock robin.
This may be a matter of taste. Pastiche is still pastiche, regardless of
theory, and I suppose some like that sort of thing. But it does raise a
different issue: the publication of one's poetry on the list. This usually
arouses all the passions one would expect in an exceedingly polite
gathering of friends, where little serious demur is likely to be voiced. If
I want my friends to see a new piece because I'm wild with excitement about
it I backchannel: seems more appropriate. But this is a forum to use as one
wishes. Nuff said.

When submitting work in response to calls from literary magazines that are
open to all comers, do women writers still feel disadvantaged?

this issue has come up before on this list and i'm sure a few contributors
will respond in the positive, that women are still at least
under-represented or excluded if not "disadvantaged" / i think there are
still (and will always be) exclusionary practices in the literary
marketplace, and good reason obviously to identify them and to counteract
with publications that represent under-represented work

frankly, i'm more concerned with those moments when editorial practices are
misconstrued as gender (or race or age or "camp") biased when there's no
supporting evidence / a female colleague of mine said she was convinced her
poem about her recent hysterectomy was rejected because the editor was male
/ i don't know if she considered other possible reasons, but she certainly
didn't mention them / the politics of that statement bother me / don't know
who the editor was, or the mag, so i admit my example is problematic, but
nonetheless the "male editor" was stereotyped

concerned as well with those moments when clearly-stated editorial biases
(interests, slants)--"women's writing with an emphasis on the natural
world", for example--are not explained / should it be obvious to me (the
tenor of Jerry's question suggests that it isn't to all readers) why an
issue-focus of this kind is (still) necessary?  / in other words, is it the
editor's responsibility to explain inclusions/exclusions (of whatever kind)
when posting calls to a list of this kind?

As Joe's spouse, then widow, I can verify without a doubt
that our surname is correctly pronounced: Che RA' vo lo.
However, we were both aware of the many mispronunciations
commonly made by those unfamiliar with the Italian language.

In any case, his Poetry is the thing, not what's in a name.

Mark:

I don't believe I've ever posted a poem to the list, though I am
certainly thankful that people with greater imaginations than my
own (like Alan Sondheim) do.

My "Orientalist haibun" post was not intended as a poem; it was a

I have recently become interested in a style of writing called "pantoum".
I am asking for suggestions from those of you familiar with this style as

Brent, if you have an apple ][ handy Teachers & Writers published long ago
a pantoum video game -- I mean a pantoum-writing program. Some writers who
have done nice things with the genre are John Ashbery ("Hotel Lautreamont"
is a pretty good example) and David Shapiro ("From Malay"). Personally, I
get a little manic in the presence of pantoums, which remind me of Ronald
Reagan.

Best of luck,
Jordan "Louis-Cabri-bait"

It distresses me that Alan Sondheim feels so distressed. I greatly value his
unique contributions to this List, which are as innovative and bracing as
any writing being done today. Please, Alan, do not censor yourself on Dean
Brink's or anyone else's account.

As for Dean Brink's criticisms, they are, I'm sure, valid as far as they go
with respect to Orientalism per se. I think, though,  the project Alan has
in mind is altogether different in  intention, that is, it has little
interest in merely reproducing Japanese figures of speech as a way to evoke
"the otherness of the Orient," with all the colonial nostalgia that implies,
but rather uses these tropes to arrive at a reconfigured pastiche in which
the language (process) itself is the focus, and which, as a by-product,
offer a critique of those nostalgias, the way they articulate an impossible
desire: an erotics of the Other.

In one way, at least, his recent poems here (and Kent Johnson's last
incredible post), function as deliberate parodies of the  style of
translation which Dean condemns. For instance, Kent's witty mention of
Witter Bynner.  Far from encouraging a stereotypical deployment of Oriental
tropes,  Alan and Kent have problematized the way we read the idea of the
East.  The playfulness of their language points up the linguistic opacity of
the Other.

How do others read this?

Well, I feel I have been sufficiently
chastened and it makes me sick to my stomach.
So see, it's ok to write out of Lautreamont
or take say Gertrude Stein apart (yes, I've
spoofed her and it's in archives now), but
God forbid we touch other cultures because
after all they're precious and we should only
work out of contemporary otherness, or maybe
not even that. So I will watch my words care-
fully on this list, as far as the politics go,
I didn't give a fuck about them but brought them
up in response to Dean and you, see? But it's
clear now, what's acceptable to the poetics
community and I stand corrected.

No more of this fucking shit will pass your way!

Alan, PC to the hilt.

Amy Clampitt has a series on Keats in _What the Light Was Like_.  Sorry, I
don't have time to check to see if it encompasses his medical studies.

Both Robert Pack and Linda Pastan have written pantoums, and I can't
remember either of the titles (they read them about 4 years ago when I
was at the Breadloaf W.C.).  They might be in the Breadloaf Anthology.

John Burt, in his book Work without Hope, has a poem about Keats called
"Love and Fame" that's definitely worth looking at.

This may have been posted already, but just in case: Eliot Weinberger
has a moving tribute to James Laughlin in the Dec. 15 Nation. It's
full of fun anecdotes and makes the plain case that Laughlin is one
of the central reasons that we all are, well, "here," reading and
thinking about writing (with all of our differences) as we do. EW
gives "The List" of who Laughlin gave us, and it's an amazing,
amazing thing. Do check it out.

Thanks for that announcement, Jena Osman. In fact, I was browsing last night

Brent Long,

You probably know of Anne Waldman's chapbook First Baby Poems.  In that chap
is a wonderful pantoum called "Baby's Pantoum" (or something close to that).
It's a splendid example of the form.  I've used the form on a few occasions,
as have a number of people.  I see in a recent letter from the poet Mary
Rising Higgins (of Albuquerque) that she's just completed one.  What do you
want to know about the form?

I have recently received the latest Capilano Review
series 2, no 23, Fall 97, which is a special issue on
bill bissett, including poems, drawings, paintings by
bissett (similar to Bryan Wynter's mescaline paintings)
an interview with bissett by D McFadden and articles on
bissett by various contributors including Susan Musgrave.
bissett an anti-authoritarian gay/bisexual poet who writes a kind
of phonetic spelling poetry that resists various power
games. He seems to have got stronger & stronger. Very
interesting issue and a must for anyone wanting to know the
range of Canadian writing.

Anyone who can order for a library please get it.

 I understand well the equity issue, both real and perceived.  Its jus=
t that women writers seem both more in evidence and taken seriously to=
day.  I have no argument with special issues or even literary mags dev=
oted exclusively to one sex or another, race, etc.  But see more equit=
y in some of the journals today than ten years ago.  Personally, I thi=
nk the quality of men's writing has gone down as their political issue=
s diminish...nothing like a little war to get the machismo flowing, ju=
st as Bush.

Brent Long/Jordan Davis et al : if pantoums remind you of Ronald Reagan
maybe you haven't seen Armand Schwerner's "The Crystal Skull Pantoums,"
Number 30 in the Backwoods Broadsides Chaplet Series, which I sent out in
October, with #31, Amiri Baraka's "Past Present." The series is $10. year
for 8 issues ppd., or these two for $2.
                Here's the opening of Armand's "The Salary"--"with material
from Svetlana Alliluyeva's twenty letters to a friend, Tarthang Tulku's
Time Space and Knowledge, & phrases from Wittgenstein (through Michael
Heller)."

there may be more parity than previously, but not enough. i was just at a
conference that hosted 3 wonderful and important male poets and NOT ONE
woman poet, though the poetic tendency or "school"  the guys represented
also can boast some eminent, accomplished and famous women.  the progress,
i think, is that the absence was glaring, esp to the guys themselves, whose
friends and/or partners were not there.  also, tho' (some few, like myself)
women may be making some gains professionally, when balanced against the
attack on reproductive rights, welfare etc and other political efforts to
control women and keep them down, the matter of visibility at the cultural
level comes to appear somewhat compensatory and selective; i.e. one woman
is invited to appear on an MLA panel for every thousand women who lose
their AFDC benefits.

CENTURY DEAD CENTER by George Economou
paper; 128 pages + 4-page color insert; $15.00

Visit the Left Hand Books website <http://www.lefthandbooks.com/lhb> to
read exerpts from CENTURY DEAD CENTER

CENTURY DEAD CENTER contains George Economou's prose,  poetry, translations
and visual art-a selection of work spanning eighteen years. The title piece
drives home Walter Benjamin's claim, in THESES ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF
HISTORY, that "There is no document of civilization which is not at the
same time a document of barbarism." In "Century Dead Center," the
phantasmagorical information age eclipses the sleep of reason.
"If the center has not held it's because it has become self-centrifugal and
keeps the appearance of not running away altogether by clinging by its
nails to its circumargin long enough to give the prophet a picture of
immanent disaster. The archaeologist sees no such thing and keeps circling
and diving. Whatever she can clutch radiates, a pressed flower that blooms
in her head. Justitia still rides her circuit, knees gripped at a 45=B0 tilt=
.
And the mythomaniac concurs with them all by telling tales from the book of
virus."
Among the five paintings by George Economou reproduced in this book is
"1892." It and its companion poem were made in response to Pierre Bonnard's
painting "Cr=E9puscule" or "La partie de croquet." The poem reflects the
painting at the level of the simplest telling. Of the group at play
depicted in Bonnard's painting, Economou writes:
"Their pleasure at dusk / exists in the image he has pictured // of it for
them-held back in the picture, / the ring of girls that almost slips his
gaze / but stays, secure in the last light of dusk. / Serene mystery
becomes the invention / of the carefree account of happiness / they figure
un-invisibly for Pierre."
  George Economou was born in Great Falls, Montana, on  September 24, 1934.
He has published six books of poetry and several books on medieval
literature. He has also published  translations from ancient and modern
Greek as well as from a  number of medieval languages, most recently
William Langland's PIERS PLOWMAN (University of Pennsylvania Press). His
poems, translations, and criticism have appeared in many leading literary
and scholarly journals. He has held fellowships for his writing from the
New York Council for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the
Rockefeller Foundation. He earned his A.B. from Colgate University and his
M.A. and Ph. D. from Columbia University. He is currently Professor of
English at the University of Oklahoma and lives with his wife,
poet-playwright Rochelle Owens, in Norman, Oklahoma and Wellfleet,
Massachusetts.

I took this passage and the whole entry as a tongue-in-cheek parody of

Brent,
The anthology A Formal Feeling Comes, which I edited, has a good long
pantoum by Anne Waldman accompanied by a description of how it is put
together and her process of writing it.  There is also a pantoum I like a
lot by Nellie Wong in the same anthology.  A poet named Vince Gotera has
been doing a lot with pantoums and his recent books should include several
of them.

Brent,

My first recommendation is that you check out the magazine Syntactics,
edited here in Atlanta.  Its editor John Lowther has been interested in
pantoums over the past year; the first issue comes with a broadside
discussing approaches to the pantoum (..these broadsides will be a regular
feature of the mag, reflecting John's intense interest in formal frames
and MacLovian procedural writing...)

There are copies of the first issue still available for $4.00:

[checks payable to John Lowther]

P.O. Box 1381
Decatur GA  30031


Also the superb and underrecognized Armand Schwerner has just come out
with a pantoum work as part of the Backwoods Broadsides series.

Ron Padgett and others designed a piece of software in 1989 called
"Pantoum : Writing Game"--described as "creative writing software to
create pantoums" in its OCLC cataloging record.

Frankly, I'm glad there isn't much poetry posted to the list.  What's missing
in this venue, obviously, is any editorial agency. I find that, while I'd
never want the posts vetted in any way, I also feel that this function can be
important & useful for creative work.  Still, I'm not at all comfortable with
the conservative implications of this.  Wonder how others feel.

As it is there are few enough poems posted to the list that, for the poet,
it's a little bit like leading with one's jaw, isn't it?  Hurt feelings are
inevitable I suppose, but it's also naive to imagine that any work will be
received by the list with anything but, at the very best, a mixed response
(because of diverse tastes, unfinished arguments, opportunities to posture,
etc.).

Probably for the best. Poetry on the list has usually been received in silence,
which is not meant to necessarily imply indifference though that could be the
case too (indifference as worse than open criticism?). Perhaps listmembers have
vulcanized themselves against the temptation to balkanize around someone's list
poems. I suppose it is unreasonable to expect universal agreement when posting
poems to the list: in replying to/about them, one may appear to be nominating
one poet to the perceived exclusion of another. Still the creative work
continues. Yours is both an argument for and against this practice. And
certainly, the mixed responses, diverse tastes, unfinished arguments, and so on
are what poetry is about right? Criticism is included like the tax. It is
essential, but is also creative writing in its own right and a dialog that is
ongoing, never ending and certainly never final.

Brent,

It comes from Malaysia, and its English form is that lines 2 and 4 of each
stanza are repeated as lines 1 and 3 of the following stanza.

Two good reference books (among many) that can answer such questions on
poetics as they come up are the Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and
Poetics and John Drury's Poetry Dictionary.

There will be mini-essays and mini-anthologies on the pantoum as well as on
a host of other "formal frameworks" (a term I feel somewhat ambivalent
about, as it suggests that the real poem is hung on, surrounded by,
supported by, or otherwise essentially different from its own form) in an
anthology now on the verge of finding a publisher that I have been
coediting.  I'm planning to send all the great pantoum suggestions made by
the list to the poet who's writing the pantoum section for that anthology.
Hopefully some of them will make it in.

Annie, I'd like to ask what you mean by serious.
Isn't pissing a universal phenomenon?
Pissing and farting are big Edo themes in Japanese literature.
There is a short treatise called "On Farting" of related interest (tr. by William
F. Sibley).
Bodily functions are found in baudy comic prose and in some of the ever
pushing-the-envelop haiku schools.
One of the most famous pissing poems in English must be Snyder's "Pissing /
watching a waterfall." This certainly rings of parody, but.

Brent,

PANTOUM
"Usually considered as one of the sophisticated French
forms though, as a matter of fact, the pantoum was taken
over from the Malaysian by Victor Hugo and other French poets.
This primitive origin is evident in the monotonous repetition
of lines, a monotony possibly derived from the rhythmic beating
of the Oriental tom-tom. The pantoum may consist of an
indefinite number of four-line stanzas, but in any case the
second and fourth verses of one stanza must reappear as
the first and third lines of the following stanza. The stanzas
are quatrains, the rime scheme being monotonously abab,
abab. In the final stanza the first and third lines of the first stanza
are repeated in reverse order, the poem thus ending
with same line with which it began."

--from A Handbook of Literature (Thrall, Hibbard, & Holman, editors)

"Primitive" is a bit of a loaded word--by whose standard?
I do agree that these poems are often "monotonous." The sestina
and villanelle read like free when compared to a pantoum. With
right subject and some really brilliant lines that bear repeating,
then the form can work--though I wouldn't relish reading
a bookful of 'em. Also, the "indefinite number of four-lines stanzas"
in wrong hands becomes an "interminable number of four-lines
stanzas."

I think a distinction needs to be made between publishing works on a
specific subject/by a specific authorship as a matter of achieving equity
versus putting together a collection of works that have something in common.
Such collections may not involve gender or or race or they may, but their
usefulness and interest to readers can be more than a function of a desire
to read those who would not otherwise be read.  I think people are awfully
quick to feel excluded.  I mean, if I didn't have any material on the
subject of carburators (I'm not even sure I can spell them) I wouldn't feel
excluded because someone was putting together a collection of poems about
them and I couldn't contribute.  Now, being a constructionist, you may argue
that women ultimately have no particular perspective that should alter their
take on nature or carberators and I may well agree with you (ultimately, if
not at this moment).  But assembling such a work allows people to answer
that question for themselves--one of its many uses.   There have certainly
been enough books on men and carberators or nature to act as points of
comparison.

Perhaps poems posted to the list could be clearly marked POEM in the subject
line so that no one reads them by accident.

Personally, I'd like to see more.  To suggest less, which no one actually
has, would be to limit resources.  Through the serendipity of their posts
I've become aware of some wonderful poets. I realise that this may be as
much a testament to my ignorance as anything else.

As regards silence: fine.  There's no need to feel that one has to respond.
One can always backchannel if time permits when a poem hits the spot.

Maybe more equity but women are still left out of history, including
literary.  Just one example --- a couple of weeks ago I heard a specialist
in contemporary poetry give an off-the-cuff list of major
language/language-influenced poets and not one woman's name was on it.  I'm
sure if he'd sat down and thought about it he would have stuck a couple on,
but on the spur of the moment it didn't even occur to him.

FEATURE: Romanian Bard Of Bizarre Takes On Christmas

By Matthew Lewis

HARTFORD, Conn. (Reuters) - He's the evil twin of Charles Dickens, or
perhaps a twisted, Transylvanian mutation of Bing Crosby.

All Andrei Codrescu wants for Christmas is a place in the pop-culture
pantheon of seasonal icons.

But unlike Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" or Crosby's rendition of "White
Christmas," the Romanian-born author's yuletide contribution is a darkly
ironic tale of U.S.-style consumerism and the quest for eternal youth.

"The Valley of Christmas: An Ancient Fable with Modern Appliances," was
released last month on Gert Town Records.

A shorter version of the work, written and narrated by Codrescu, made a
splash last year when it was broadcast on National Public Radio (NPR) in the
United States.

"This is a way to say something about the shameless growth of consumer
culture -- while adding to it, of course," Codrescu told Reuters by
telephone, from his home in New Orleans.

His fractured fairy tale sprang from a Romanian folk tale, which Codrescu
salted with cyber-age pop references and baked into a surreal souffle.

"People are sick to death of sugary, sentimental Christmases, and staring
straight into the TV," he said. "So they might enjoy listening to a play
with music about Christmas that actually attacks the demon TV."

Codrescu, 51, does not own a television.

The poet, novelist and essayist is perhaps best known as a commentator on
NPR's program "All Things Considered." He also teaches English at Louisiana
State University in Baton Rouge.

"The Valley of Christmas" is the story of Almond Joy, a boy magically
conceived in a New Orleans cemetery and born on Christmas Day to a yuppie
couple in matching jogging outfits.

After a bizarre journey to the Valley of Christmas and eternal youth, Almond
Joy returns to the outside world, where he discovers that the apocalypse has
occurred, and humanity has been sucked into the screens of its television

Depends what you're writing.  E.g., great for babies and also extreme old
age.  Wouldn't want to do an action narrative in it.  Although the
so-called monotony might match up well with infantry experience in war...

As good a time as any to announce that the National Poetry Foundation  will
be publishing in October of 1998 a complete Tablets, with CD of Armand
reading from same included, to be distributed by U. Presses of New England.
Also in 1998 Junction Press will do the collected non-tablets poems,
including of course the pantoums, as well as a mass of other wonderful work
that is otherwise available only in mostly hard-to-find sources.

Brent et alia,

Just to add to the pantoum thread here, one I've much enjoyed was John
Ashbery's "Hotel Latraemont" [sp?; vide the eponymous volume.  The poem 1st
appeared in the New Yorker in 1990; the book appeared a few years later) - -
I still recall a few lines (might not be 100% verbatim):

If we wanted to leave, would being naked help us?
And what of older, lighter concerns?  What of the river?

Children twirl hoolahoops, imaginging a door to the outside,
When all we can think of is how much we can carry with us.
And what of older, lighter concerns?  What of the river?
All the behemouths have filed through the maze of time.  . . .

/ / /

it's a marvelous poem - - every line can be savored; the ambiguity of tone -
- the sense of social analysis, anthopology, metaphysics, epistemology, the
study of personality & its dissolution - - all the stuff is brought in
through implication or indirection or something.  And the formalism, the
repetition, render it positively wonderful.

If I had to single out a few most-memorable poems from the past decade, that
would certainly be high on the list.

/ / /

Another contemp. pantoum encountered in recent years was written by Agha
Shahid Ali (he recited this at the Folger Shakespeare Theatre in a reading
here in DC a couple years ago, sorry don't recall name of the poem).
Chances are it may appear in his new book (which I've not yet gottn a copy
of), published some months ago.  As I recall, Shahid (unlike John Ashbery)
made use of rhyme throughout the pantoum.

best,
d.i.

Parity's not the half of it:  when I graduated from school, female poets far
outnumbered male poets in my class (I think there were three graduating male
poets to a dozen female, but I don't really remember).  Now that I am
beginning to teach, the ratio in poetry students is remaining the same:  not
even one in three of the students is male.  With that sort of ratio, one would
expect female publishing and working poets to outnumber male.

(I'm trying to get around the "but are students more likely to be female than
poets" by adding "employed".)

And look at this list!  Women on my other lists (non-poetry related, even two
highly technical) outnumber or at least come close to matching the number of
men on the list.

Do you mean that these political issues are diminishing or that men's
perception or experience of or ability to frame these issues is
diminishing?

>nothing like a little war to get the machismo flowing, just as Bush.

Is that what you mean by political issues?

Personally, I'd say there are political issues, the political issues are
being ignored, and that this is, among other things, a problem of poetics.

I don't know how the Gulf War was perceived in the U.S.A. but up here in
Canada it was perceived pretty cynically. That might be a political issue,
but it is not machismo.  Is it?

I'd be interested in hearing how the Gulf War was perceived in the U.S.A.

Machismo is a male political issue? Sure, but how do you mean? I feel you
could say so much more on this, and I'd like to hear it.

Also, the first 2 lines and the second 2 of each quatrain deal with
different subjects of themes, so what you have is both thematic and

You raise an interesting question when you note that women on other lists
that I assume represent more lucrative or powerful callings than poetry are
more nearly equal to men in numbers (tho probably not in salaries). Even in
our own field there are some questions to be asked. I've just finished
sending out review copies for a couple of books. There was rough gender
parity among the editors, with the three most important for the survival of
a small press, Booklist, Library Journal and Publishers Weekly, all being
women. In the for-profit publishing world there's no shortage of female
editors, and the areas of real authorial power, self-help, cooking, and
romance novels, are almost dominated by women. Women are also
well-represented in fiction, which is only marginally profitable, except
for titles picked up for the movies. Why, then, in this least powerful,
least remunerated area of the literary world, are there fewer "female
publishing and working poets?" It's possible that men insist upon a
monopoly of the bottom, but there must be other factors.

Truth Will Out

I have recently become interested in a style of recycling, yet
pantaloons or no pantaloons there's a mythomaniac pissing
in the washing machine. Why, anybody, that's important.
        Bold as love
        botcher for keeps
        off grassy
        green ground that I
        figure on,
depressed (pantalooned or not). Oh sure I come off when I
get wet too. This yarn winds fast into a pit of Whoppers and
I don't have the stomach not to take it. I have recently
interested a mythomaniac in a style of ground; wet or not
(yet pantalooned) there's a botcher figure in the writing
machine: is that important?

Well, I'll trade you for how the two recent union-busting strikes were
perceived in Canada. Here the people I talked to thought the Gulf War was
an opportunity for a weak president to consolidate political capital while
protecting trade routes (ahem, read large cap) and mollifying a recklessly
endangered ally (Israel, not Kuwait), endangered not by the conflict but
by the propping up of the now-menacing puppet Hussein (viz Noriega etc
etc). That 93% of the country thought that the US position was not only
tenable but right and good (and that we must SUPPORT THE TROOPS) was seen
as just more evidence that lefties like Sly Stallone shouldn't mess with
the propaganda techniques (and personality styles) of fascism. Bush got
creamed in the following election, Hussein remained in power, the
sanctions imposed after the war were probably as gruesomely ill-advised as
the reparations imposed at Versailles, and who knows, maybe there really
is such a thing as Gulf-War Syndrome.

From here it looks like Canada's got some kind of mysterious right-wing
anti-urban contingent (the guy who broke the teachers was, apparently, a
lousy teacher) happily moving money out of the cities. The news from
America is, this policy succeeds in destroying the poorest people, and in
intensifying racism, classism, etc.

Eh?

Being curious about this statistical issue, I ordered up from
the Listserv computer a fresh copy of the Poetics subscriber list
(562 identified subscribers, plus 2 concealed, -- hailing from, btw,
a total of 19 countries; 463 of the e-addresses are American).

I read thru the list, counting female names.  My count is very
approximate, since (for instance) I never learned the principles by
which one can (within limits) determine the gender of a Japanese
person based on the syllable-ending (and/or number of syllables) of
the personal name; and with subscribers identified by initials in
lieu of a first name, what to do? -- then there's the matter of
double (or even triple) subscriptions in a few cases . . .

Okay, w/ such caveats & imperfections, anyway I counted up female
names & by the end of the list had ticked off (only) 152.  One could
prob. call it more like 200 (even  as much as 225 maybe?), given the
imperfections of method -- but that still amounts to around 40% of
the total subscribers.  This doesn't seem an extreme male majority --
but then, it's not the 12 females to 3 males noted below, either.

I've not subscribed to other longstanding poetry lists such as the
CAP-L, but wonder if the numbers there might be stronger on the
female side?

A diehard statistician might count up ratios of posts, and might
arrive at a figure similar to that of the subscribes (?), or perhaps
even more male-heavy?

Alan,

BTW, I trust you might in fact be familiar w/ Lafcadeo Hearn?  If
not, I'd say he's well worth checking out.  Wonderful early 20th C.
writer -- I think originally American (Greek origins?), but he lived
much of his adult life in Japan, was a diehard japanophile, and wrote
with much knowledge & appreciation of traditional culture.  His books
of ghost tales were especially loved in my teens -- as were his various
essays & studies.  I think the publisher Kodansha has (had?) much of
his work in print (inexpensive yet beautifully designed & illustrated
paperbacks -- in fact some of the most lovely books I've seen) --

On another note, if Dean Brink has citation for the piss/waterfall
poem attributed to Gary Snyder, I'd be please to have it.

But where ironies grow thick, I don't know who's talkin' to me on the
level.  Things were a bit easier in Japanese lifetimes, when we could
wax Sinocentric (if so inclined), without being blasted out of the
waterpond on that account.  Ah well . . .

Gary, the poem has nothing outstandingly gross in it, nor does it trea=

 it well and with belief that he has been on the slauhter house floor.=
  Others treat the subject much more in style, including Adrienne Rich=
 in one of her latter works in which she describes in full living colo=
r, network news style, a processing plant with safety exits nailed shu=
t to keep workers from stealing product and the result of a fire at th=
e plant...gruesome just in description without ouze.  Nice attemp, but=
 no cigar.

I agree, anything that allows easier access to gender, race, understan=

How about a piece on not understanding carbuerators, which, by the way=
 are quickly becoming extinct as fule injection takes over.  Anyone ou=

I see a similar, but divergent view of men and women on nature.  Men c=
ertainly express the seeing and the moment, women bring more spirit an=
d soul, adding new dimension.  For men, the exception may be Wendell B=
erry.

And, it gives the woman poet more freedom to address issues of being f=

does anyone on the list know

of The Four Horsemen? I've

(bootlegs and cassette-copies are

enthusiasm of so many people (including my own son, 10 at the time, who was
totally sucked in by propaganda, predisposed as he was by the conventions
of cartoons and so-called action figures), even people whose other politics

Must be differences in the structure of the hippocampus that accounts for
this. Or maybe in the visual cortex. Or maybe it's a matter of hormones. Or
maybe it's learned behavior, and Wordsworth is different because after his
mother's death he insisted on wearing a dress in her memory. Or maybe this

Jordan,

Thanks for the Gulf War exegisis. Sounds much like what I've encountered up
this way, except the percentages are completely different. You say 93% of
the country thought that the US positon was right and good. Here, it was
far below 50%. I remember someone had set up a collection box in my bank,
to raise money to send boxes of apples to the troops, to cheer them up for
Christmas. It was spurned and ridiculed, and the attempt to regenerate the
support for the troops of WWII was found offensive by many.

Then you ask a tough question:

>From here it looks like Canada's got some kind of mysterious right-wing
>anti-urban contingent (the guy who broke the teachers was, apparently, a

There is a right wing thing, it succeeds in destroying the poorest people
and intensifying racism, classism, etc., yes, yes, but it isn't mysterious,
and I think it would be wrong to see it as an anti-urban contingent. The
'urban' is, however, a red-herring. It has to do more with cultural values,
and perhaps, surprise, surprise, with power. Just to continue the
urban/rural split a little farther, however: it has been said that Canada
can be seen in two ways, either as a vast and beautiful space punctuated
occasionally by cancerous growths called cities, which one must drive
around and/or avoid at all costs, or a chain of a few vibrant cities,
separated by uninhabitable and boring emptiness which must be driven
through at the greatest speed possible. Geography and history determine
politics in Canada. A very few cities, and a very small power-base within
those cities, control the culture, the images, and the economy of the
country. The result is that most regions of the country (but not the
greater part of the population, as that is centralized) feel
disenfranchized from power and the cultural trappings of power. The
concentration of resources in urban regions has resulted in a crisis of
faith: in British Columbia, many people wish that Vancouver would float out
to sea so that they could finally have some say in their own affairs;
Quebec wants to leave; and (to generalize dangerously) most everyone west
of Ontario does not believe that the images and cultural icons of Canada
fit their lives. The regions of Canada, some of them small, some of them
large like Quebec, but all of them culturally distinct, feel (rightly, I
think) colonized by cities, not because they are cities, but because power
has been accumulating in cities as of late, positive change has been
occuring in cities, while cultural loss and/or re-colonization has been
occuring in the hinterland. The reaction is for the most part cynicism,
and, in many areas, right-wing activities. The province of British
Columbia, where I live, voted predominantly Reform (right wing) in the last
federal election. This should not be read as a pure love of right wing
politics (though there is that), but more as a complete distrust of central
Canadian power, probably because people are tired of policies which do not
fit their situations and do not take them into account. Many lifelong
socialists voted Reform, for instance. That these feelings come out as a
backlash against intellectual values should not be surprising: left alone,
patronized, isolated, in communities disenfranchized from education and
political discussion because the discussion and the education do not
embrace their concerns, people grasp at straws and fall back on past
'certainties'. Some of this stuff is quite ugly and filled with hate.
Frankly, the propaganda techniques of the Reform party and the right-wing
press sound to my sensitized ears very much like the ardent, mocking Nazi
press of the 1930's. Intellectuals are not innocents in this game of power,
however, for in this dysfunctional system of centralization and
marginalization they too have been unable to find a means of bridging the
growing power gap and in many cases of even seeing it. The right wing
expression of this sense of isolation is not new, however. We hear a lot
about it in Ontario these days, as the Ontario government seeks to
dismantle the social democratic apparatus of the state. Little mention
seems to be made, however, of the fact that 16 years ago British Columbia
went though the same process of destructuring, with the same acrimony. It
has led to increased centralized control. It is not a matter, however, of
an attempt to remove money from cities: money has been accumulating in
cities very nicely and will continue to do so. Recent developments, in
which power in Ontario is being removed from cities, such as Toronto, and
moved to the provincial government (in Toronto), are a different matter.
Perhaps the force that has led to the accumulation of wealth and power in
centralized areas has reached its finest expression by now cannibalizing
the city which has been its purest tool. This has not happened in Vancouver
yet, perhaps because Vancouver is cannibalizing itself and the province of
B.C. quite nicely all on its own, in a game which the provincial government
is losing.

Well, that's what it looks like from out here in the bush.

To anticipate a question: What does that have to do with poetics?

Lots.

I vote for only remotely correct. What is meant by spirit and soul?
Obviously not that there is no spirit and soul in seeing and the moment,
but it sounds like it.

As for Berry, there are many other exceptions. For instance, shortly before
he died last spring, Charles Lillard posed what was to be his final
question to me: "Why have so damned many loggers in B.C. turned to writing
poetry?" Sounds like spirit and soul. His own poetry was slammed by many
feminists, for being blind to feminism. This was an unfortunate and gross
mis-reading. Yes, women add new dimension. So do men. Balance would suggest
that men are as distant from the female experience as women are from the
male. This strikes me as a strong argument for balancing the representation
of the sexes in the poetry world: communication, multiplicity, common
ground. I don't think it will happen until the nature of the discussion and
its forum change. This is just a guess. I would guess that many women are
interested in poetics, but not in the kind of talk that goes on here. That
is not a value judgment, by the way. I could be completely wrong.

But 'more spirit and soul'? My experience is that women often cast nature
(itself a generalization) in a stronger, more immediate social context than
do men, or, that men are dreamers, seeking to extend their social context
(and those dreams can be dreams of forest pillage or of utility) and women
are practical (and that practicality can be grounded in visions), with the
caveat that we all are all over the map, but also that we all see 'beauty'
and corollary dimensions and react to it. Then again, this could just be an
externalization of my own personal characteristics.

Still, men may be more visually-oriented, and may be more willing to place
what they experience into the context of 'rational' structures, even to the
detriment of the experience, whereas women may be more willing to place
what they experience into the context of 'social' structures. That's not
'more spirit and soul'. That is different 'spirit and soul'. That is a
series of terms which are often taken for granted, perhaps to our
detriment.

Perhaps better: men and women share the same 'spirit' and 'soul', but it is
filtered differently. Perhaps because we come to the words 'spirit' and
'soul' differently, perhaps because we come to (or leave) the experience
differently (or maybe we don't).

Poetics denizens,

Having lately posted to Poetics in praise of Hearn, I found myself =
wistfully
drawn to investigate what of his work is yet extant.

First to note, I=27d erroneously deified his personal name (it=27s spelled
Lafcadio, not ..cadeo);

second to note, I mentioned those charming paperbacks -- said volumes were
in fact published by Charles E. Tottle (not, as I claimed, Kodansha, --
though Kodansha has also published some work by Hearn;

third to note, Amazon.com lists something like 50 Lafcadio titles -- a
veritable trove for the curious.

Here (see below) are several books recalled fondly (from 20+ years ago) --
books I=27d generally purchase in places like the bookstore at the Pacific
Asian Museum (Pasadena), riding thither on three-speed (a callow teenager
unwitting of how future PC scholiasts might look askance at this infarction=

in manners).

Truth is, evidently Hearn covered a good deal more literary ground than
Japan; -- but if there was something reprehensible about his respectful =
and
appreciative treatment of things Japanese, I=27d be willing to entertain
consideration of the late critique, to scrutinize information on his
suggested erroneousness, or whatnot.

cheerio, what?
d.i.

I did read Lafcadio Hearn a while ago, but felt that it was somehow off,
but didn't know why... It did remind me of an "Orientalism" so to speak,
although I may have misjudged, and it was so long ago...

His books are quite popular among the Japanese, and are available here as
well.

Individual men and women tend to imagine their opposite numbers in
possession of traits that they lack themselves--a dream of completion thru
union that's familiar enough. Of course, those alien traits can also become
pretty scary, so the dream can become a nightmare if one isn't careful.
Some people split the available character traits into genders--our
masculine and femimine selves became cliches in the 60's. There never was a
whole lot of accuracy in this. There surely, in any society, are ranges of
difference, even in innate characteristics. Men tend to be taller and
faster than women, but I'm shorter and slower than most of the women I
know. The learned emotional patterns also vary with circumstance within the
same society. While it is certainly true that women in general have been
given the short end, the degree and manner differ.
As we age men lose testosterone and women gain it, which tends to lessen
some of the physical and psychological differences, at least those that
appear to be inherent. Maybe a way to be more precise in our political
correctness than calculation by the appearance of genitals and secondary
sexual characteristics would be to average the amount of estrogen and
testosterone in the contributors to a magazine, say. If the average swings
too far in the direction of estrogen, throw in a young male or an older
woman. If it swings too far towards testosterone, throw in a young woman. A
simple blood test would do it. To demonstrate fairness to the world at
large blood analyses could be included in the contributor bios that often
come at the end of an issue.

Patricia,

What you are describing sounds like a hybrid of the ghazal (a Persian and
Indian form) and the pantoum.  In the ghazal the couplets are distinct
thematically.  I;'ve never heard of any such tradition in the pantoum.
Might you be thinking of the ghazal here"

I also wondered if Shahid Ali perhaps read a ghazal rather than a pantoum
at the Folger, since he's been working with ghazals for a long time.

The following message was rejected by the listserver as having been already
sent. I think not. That cybercensor must be at it again. All of which gives
me the opportunity to revisit and refine. Here goes.

Individual men and women tend to imagine their opposite numbers in
possession of traits that they lack themselves--a dream of completion thru
union that's familiar enough. Of course, those alien traits can also become
pretty scary, so the dream can become a nightmare if one isn't careful.

woman. If it swings too far towards testosterone, throw in a young woman. A
simple blood test would do it. To demonstrate fairness to the world at
large blood analyses could be included in the contributor bios that often
come at the end of an issue. Perhaps a similar test could be devised for
determining balance in ethnicity and class.

<< . . . I also wondered if Shahid Ali perhaps read a ghazal rather than a

I'm aware of both forms.  Shahid definitely read a pantoum (and a nice one
-- though it went by a bit too quick to really quite "get" it) at the
Folger.  I'm pretty sure he didn't read a ghazal that evening (regrettably);
in fact, guess I've never heard him read one -- though a bit later that
night, over beer, he did *sing* a couplet or two (in Urdu, from memory) from
Mirza Ghalib (this, after I'd recited for him the same in an English
version).

Yes, I understand Agha Shahid Ali has been putting together a book
anthologizing English-language ghazals -- which should be interesting to say
the least.  As already said, I've a hunch his pantoum might appear in his
own (latest) book -- but have not yet gotten my hands on a copy, to see.

all best,
d.i.

Oh no. If I have sounded like the CBC I hang my head in shame. Apologies to
all. I mean that.

I hope you weren't including the bit about recolonization, because it is
rampant and we dismiss it at our peril.

Or the bit about disillusionment, because I know very few people who are
not profoundly disillusioned.

Or the bit about cannibalization, because it has happened, is happening,
and will likely continue to happen, whatever name is given to it.

Look, my point was that Jordan's parameters were, innocently, off the mark:
"mysterious right-wing" backlash, "removing money from cities", and so
forth. If my analysis was trite and boring, I again apologize, but any
useful Canadian analysis had better step away from race, class, and the
mysteries of an anti-urban agenda, even if they are vital subjects, and
talk about what is really going on, just as any useful poetics had better
step away from the familiar parameters of what might be called the great
project of civilization to embrace those images and cultures abandoned in
the creation of that grand vision and left to moulder and fester. I did not
mention 1930s Germany idly. Any country worth its salt needs to be made
new, and anything that deserves the name of poetry had better remake
itself, and anyone who considers him or herself an intellectual should be
willing to at least consider his or her implication in the creation of his
or her dark double, whether it is evil or simply ungenerous or whatever.

Race is important, class is important, but so is geography, in this country
at least. We could debate the merits or demerits of each, but that is not
the point. The point is that geography and its accompanying history should
be in the same group as race and class. I think there might be some
agreement that silent and excluded cultures should be brought into the
discussion. Not just to add a few items to the agenda, but to change the
terms of the agenda, not just to write a few poems in an adopted style, but
to change that style. Feminism should have taught us all that much. Poetry
should have taught us all that much.

Please, if you are the sophisticated political observer you appear to be,
forgive this if it is boring a second time, and give us the useful analysis
which I failed to do, and a useful poetics to accompany it.

Thanks.

The most cynical thing I ever heard a US president say was George Bush's
reply to a reporter who asked why we were going to invade Kuwait: "Jobs,
jobs, jobs." It's frightening to think that such excessive candor can
actually reassure a public worried more about paying a few more cents
per gallon at the pump. A tradeoff: [someone else's--and our own guys'!]
blood for gas? Sure, what the hell. Does anyone remember greater
temblors on the junkyarddog/cynicism Richter scale?

Harold, Mark,

Wow, this is better'n the globe and mail. Well ok I'll backtrack and
rephrase -- the teachers of ontario were striking because why. What I
heard was something along the lines of 'taxation without schoolboard
autonomy' -- that the money going to fund public schooling in the cities
was not going to be allocated by the schoolboards of the cities but
instead by a board of governors.. now I may be conflating the dismantling
of the district of columbia's schools, cops, firepeople etc with this
situation..

We don't get the CBC so much in New York, but if it's anything like Public
Radio International that's ok then. PRI leaks paralyzing gas that
stimulates the part of the brain that says "You are helpless," much like a
text that the reader is supposed to create.

La di da,
Jordan

America is, this policy succeeds in destroying the poorest people, and in
intensifying racism, classism, etc.

And that 'guy' -- the premier of Ontario -- is just following, but more
stupidly, the route followed, with great success, by Alberta's folksy
fascist Ralph Klein. Of course, out here, the excuse was the need to cut
cut cut (salaries for unionized government workers; health care, education,
etc) to get rid of a huge deficit; after three years of multi-billion
dollar surpluses, this argument is a little worn but they fight on against
such 'special interest groups' (like the teachers of Ontario, it seems) as
everyone but their good friends in big (& multinational) business.

So, yep, Jordan, it looks a lot that way from 'here' too...

Have to add that Harold Rhenisch makes a number of really relevant points
in his response to Jordan. Certainly, there is a lot of dis-enchantment
with the federal government out here in the west, & it has led to a lot of
Reformers being elected. But there's also a terrific prooganda coup by the
provincial politicians who say they're after greater equality for the
people when all they really want is all the power previously divided
between the feds & them to themselves -- NOT to the people actually. It is
a much subtler form of classical fascism (not the Nazis but the Italian
version without the bells & whistles), & so far it seems to have worked in
happy (oil-rich) Alberta...

Beats me.  He doesn't talk about things like that with his parents.  But
judging from his clothes (muted earthtoned unbelievably sloppy) and music
(Doors, Digible Planets) I suspect he's figured out he was conned.

The worst moment in the GW for me was the triumphant reporting of our

those guys trapped in the giant Iraqi traffic jam of tanks and trucks and

that armies do things like that, it is, as one says, in their mission, but
we should at least have the compassion not to rejoice at the sufferings of
others, that's what I was taught and continue to enact every Passover.

By the way, the men/women thread going on is one I find either offensive or
silly, can't decide.  You're a major perp, so thought I'd pass it one
woman's feelings on.

Wowee zowee, I just got an ad for a computer program called Diction 4.0,
which is "a scientific method for determining the tone of a verbal message
using a powerful language analysis software program that searches a passage
for five general features as well as thirty-five sub-features."  These five
features are: certainty, activity, optimism, realism, and commonality.  And
so on.

Comes from a guy in the depts. of communications (natch) & government at UT
Austin.

Have no idea how I got on this particular mailing list and sure can't
afford the $$ or time to check into this, but has anyone used stuff like
this?  It seems so...so.... bizarre.

(By the way, Maya Angelou's so-called poem for Clinton's inauguration is
one of the sample texts included, as are speeches by Clinton, Nixon, and
Dole, as well as "several other interesting passages."  Indeed.)

Oh yeah, if anyone wants to order it, it costs $89 until Dec. 31, $129
after, runs only with Windows (yuck), order@scolari.com.  Which is not a
plug, not at all.

One of the worst moments that was ugly all around. The triumphant reporting by
the military of the event (playing the part of the "good cops"), the frame job
and laundering by the news media, and the depraved Iraqi soldiers caught
fleeing a city whose citizens they had shot and raped, whose zoo animals they
had tortured to death.

Judy,

As a wannabe mathematician who met his Waterloo in 2nd semester calculus
(just couldn't get integration; loved differentiation), I'm curious about
what field of mathematics you study in and how that informs your
poetry/poetics. If it does at all.

cheers,
Steven

Point a: for its self-satisfaction and its comfortable biases.

Point b: you're right. It's either that or nothing.

Still, I spent a month once in my basement, under one swaying, naked
electric bulb, grafting fruit tree rootstocks, listening to the CBC. It was
like a sentence of solitary confinement in a prison of natter. I spent the
next two weeks in silence. Which was better. Then I went outside. Which was
better. It was spring out there.

Still, you're right: some Top 40 station, or the C&W out of Spokane, or
interminable talk shows out of Seattle, would have been worse.

Folksy fascist. Well said!

I like that 'special interest group' thing: the entire population can be
dismissed with three words. Better yet, that dismissed population seems to
accept it, or has not found a way to combat it. Worse yet, each member of
the population has been isolated from all the rest. All with 3 words.

Yeah, that's what I heard, too, but you're probably closer to Toronto,

kind of sophistication of delivery.

Electronic critic?  A great idea.  How about a whole electronic
poetry workshop, complete with optional biases under the
"preferences" menu.  Select "Random P.P." and feed it your
poem and BEEP BEEP you get criticism from the obsessive
perspective of workshop members with a randomly-generated

ditto

I have found many relationships, whether in my native interest in logic and
"sprung" logic, induction, etc.

I find that in many ways mathematical expressions can act in the same way as
some poems:  the movement in calculus, the relationships in algebra, the
elegance of some proofs, the way that slightly different assumptions lead to
entirely different systems.

But it would be nice to hear from someone with more knowledge in this area.

You are familiar with the India-n traditions of mathematical meditation?  They
really appealed to me as an undergrad during a math-religion double major
phase.  Of course I was using it as an excuse to "meditate" on the
ramifications of something rather than do the problem.  I don't think I have
the books anymore, but there were some wacky guys on mountains just pondering
math problems and coming up with some interesting stuff.

jordan, harold, douglas et al.:

yes, bill 160 takes decisions that formerly resided at the local school
board level (such as class size, preparation time, length of school day
and year) and places them in the hands of the provincial *cabinet* --
particularly frightening because premier mike harris' initial education
minister was one john snowblen, a high school dropout; then when the
teachers' strike got going, harris replaced snowblen with dave johnson who
is known primarily as a union buster and the sucessful foiler of a public
service workers strike almost two years ago.

among the many sad deplorable things in all this was to see the
students become pawns in the whole things and to hear the insulting
rhetoric dripping from harris' mouth: teachers, think about what those
nasty union bosses are telling you before you jeopardize the futures of
your students.

and then to top it off: 1) johnson told the papers that teachers who wore
green ribbons of protest in the classroom after the strike had no business
discussing the strike in the classroom, that it was "morally wrong";
right, no place for politics in the classroom, and while we're at it, keep
out history, government, economics, ethics, oh hell thought in general...
2) harris, at a recent summit on the future of post-secondary education,
told the audience that, because of the multiple ontario grad programs in
the humanities, sociology, and geography, graduates of sd programs have
"very little chance of contributing to society in any meaningful way"
(globe/mail november 20 or 21).

So it is--right there in the Princeton. Thanks Patricia. That makes the
pantoum a still more interesting form.  My sense that the couplets of the
ghazal are thematically self-contained comes from Shahid Ali's essay on the
ghazal, which I'll be including in a collection of essays I'm editing on
poetic forms.

Inclined Pole Where Tomorrow the Young Men

What makes some forms more interesting to
"New Formalist" poets than others? Would
you see the formal challenges of the
sonnet or villanelle, for example, as being
of more "poetic value" (or more worthy of
attention, or more relevant to our
times, etc.) than, say, any of the hundreds
of invented Oulipean procedural
constraints, or any of the hundreds,
for instance, of Jackson Mac Low's opera-
tional creations? I believe you will
say that no, there is nothing really
intrinsically "better" about the
old traditional forms, and answer thus:


The Poem Itself is the Final Pudding

But with so many poetic recipes at hand,
and most of them of recent design, why
do some "formalist" poets (a number
of them on record as being rather
arrogant about the whole thing) equate
"formal feeling" with accentual sy-
llabic strictures and old European
stanzaic structures? I know it sounds trite,
but sometimes I wonder if the content
extending form or the form extending
content (do you see a real difference?)
goes deeper than the poem. I mean, you know,
what is the dark-matter trunk of the sonnet
form and the severed head of the Tutsi child?


The Freedom That a Skeleton of Perceiving Has

And where and when does a sonnet cease to
be a Sonnet? For example, John Clarke, whose
mentor, somewhat paradoxically,
was Charles Olson, consistently crammed mass-
ive amounts of cultural/historical
matter into fourteen line poems that he called
(and in no way ironically) "Sonnets." But
his lines rarely scan iambically
(though they are usually of ten sylla-
bles, with frequent alexandrine substitutions)
and end-rhyme is little employed. No, it's not free
verse: It's iambs being pounded into dactyls
and spondees. It's the quantum rocks of rhyme
thrown up (and washed throughout the poem) to show

[trailing couplet]

the world beneath (world of bright insects and
invisible maze-cities appearing).


Are the Sonnets of Gioia Better Sonnets than the Sonnets of  Clarke?

And I don't mean "better poems" because I
know the answer to that one. And Clarke, too,
would have said, I believe, that his poems come
from a "Formal Feeling," but a feeling
with such a volume and head behind it
that only the major shape of sonnet
form is left. Like the ruins of a temple
pounded by history. The sonnet is
like that, and that is partly the point, I think,
that the words and the syllables are like
the waters and the winds that leave their in-
scriptions _in the form_ of the ruins and
give them their actual form. There is no
language outside the ruin of form.

best,
Kent

Naturally, such a program would (methinks) be only as saavy as its
programmers.  That is, the basis for determination of the tone of a
specimen of writing certainly would appear to be very culture-bound;
I wonder how in the world their software would deal with your average
epistolary utterance from the 18th or 19th century, say.  From the
brief description you give (or summarize), I'd imagine the program
assumes such things as:  contemporary (late 20th century) language;
(presumably) some or other sorta class background / education;
whatnot.

One idly wonders how in the world it would deal with a sentence from
your average John Ashbery or John Yau or Leslie Scalapino poem, say.
Or if it could make heads or tails of (as another case) e.e. cummings.
(Am reading his nonlectures at the moment, some of which text might

By the way, I stood there in the afternoon sunlight when Maya
declaimed that poem -- and felt it came off well; (I mean, from that
amid-the-crowd vantage, I quite enjoyed it (will admit) -- as suited
to such public occasion, and rising to the dimensions of occasion
admirably -- do I besmirch my name by the admission?)

Four Sonnets for Kent Johnson



"What makes some forms more interesting to"

What makes some forms more interesting to
"New Formalists" (though I'm not one of those),
specifically, e.g., the sonnet, has
to do not only with the metrics, line-
length, stanza-distribution, and so forth,
but also with the complex range of moods
evoked by literary history
and the awareness of tradition. Forms
we recognize because we know their _use_--
their application in remembered texts--
have resonances stronger than the nonce-
forms generated arbitrarily
by methods such as you enumerate
(Mac Low's experiments, etc.).



"And that is not to denigrate Mac Low,"

And that is not to denigrate Mac Low,
or other innovators, whose inventions
have already begun to constitute
a "genre" with its own familiar surface,
one which provides a spur for further work,
but not as fully saturated with
the echoes of historical production
as those old European forms, which speak
to us because we've spoken them so often,
engraved them in a mental Norton-print:
verses of fourteen lines just "naturally"
remind us of a centuries-old practice
that has become inseparable from Voice,
or has decided for us what Voice is.



"A sonnet, one might say, ceases to be"

A sonnet, one might say, ceases to be
a sonnet when it ceases to remind
us of one: when the svelteness of its torso
dilates or dwindles in unlikely places
(and then, it arguably only ceases
to be a photogenic sonnet, no?);
or, alternately, when it is not flanked
by fellow poems similarly sculpted,
thus cancelling the cyclical effect;
or when it introduces formal features
that override its basic sonnet traits--
of course, such a scenario implies
it _is_ a sonnet, albeit one that
has forfeited its formal heritage.



"No language outside the ruin of form?"

No language outside the ruin of form?
Perhaps. Perhaps all discourse constitutes
a filling-in, or colonizing of,
the fossil shells of primal semiotics;
but is that really saying anything
other than that there's not that much to say?
And what's that have to do with whether sonnets
are "good" or not? Do you mean "good" in that
they rhyme ABBA, and that the turn
comes at the proper junction? or that they
demand of us a rigorous engagement
with principles we took for granted? If
the latter, I'm with you. But then again,
I kind of dig the former meaning too...

I get it--any statement divided into groups of 14 lines of similar length
is a sonnet sequence. Hey! That's pretty easy!

Certainly it's important to create an enemy in order to rally the gnu.
However, can we not create an up-to-date enemy? Brrragh says the gnu. Who
is a horse befriended by a toad. They ride along the hillside and declare
it Broadway!

Certainly it is important to argue with people who create enemies.
However, can we not say to them that they must improve their manufactures
or their subsidies will expire? Can't we at least insist that the hoaxes
be as _inspiring_ as the best hoaxes of other times? Or is it important to
settle for historical representation there, as well.

Smug hangs over LA and NY. Ambient critique. Broadway! Time for some
ambient belt-tightening. No new dictionaries until reputation inflation
comes down below 10%. Reviewers with bad credit exceeding 20% of their
cultural capital will be allowed to go under. Regional development
authorities must enforce term limits _at once_ or have their door fees
abolished. The ratio of interpoet communication to infrapoet consultation
should meet a target of four to one by Jan 1 2003. Poetics daily limit
should be abolished, but no-mail should be suspended as well.

Sorry,

Bush serves as one of the archetypes of this political age, especially=
 in foreign policy and more specifically, third world nations with exp=
loitable resources and nations in which the predominate power structur=
e and culture is in the hands of people of color.   We revel in an age=
 where politics of all sorts become advertising and TV images (tho, no=
t that much different in almost any era of US history in particular, a=
nd Western history in general, just a more powerful and pervasive imag=
e media than ever before...maybe invasive).  Even more, Bush is the ar=
chetypical passive-aggressive who can only build his self esteem by ac=
ts such as the Gulf War...if one can credit that escapade with a meani=
ngful word like war.  It represents a false and shallow vision and con=
tinuation of the US tradition from Tripoli on to Iraq of skirmishes wi=
th those the leaders of the time feel both a disdain and ability to bl=
ow out of the water very quickly...anyone for the Spanish-American exp=
ansionist escapade, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Panama, and now, the =
Gulf, to mention but a few self-esteem building and asset building or =
"protection" excursions.  Of course, history is replete with the Bush =
archetype, but it seems even more insidious when "weapons of mass dest=
ruction" are in the hands of such weak willed individuals and no front=
-end checks and balances exist to evaluate so-called threats.  Often, =
the foolish event gets stopped, at of all places, the Pentagon.  But, =
what is a military establishment to do in times of "peace" when the se=
rvices are downsized and lots of 20+ men have no battle field experien=
ce and opportunity to obtain promotions, much less those with 10 years=
 service who can only hope for some skirmish so rank may be conveyed..=
.especially critical in the IBM of services, the Air Force.  Besides, =
if one builds the most powerful weopons and military toys the world ha=
s ever seen, even when viewed in some sort of relative perspective tow=
ard the power and weaponry of the "great military powers" of other his=
torical eras, one must show the damn penis off to get respect of other=

As an effort toward a better definition of machismo, machismo in and o=
f itself is not all bad, only when expressed in overyly aggressive way=
s (overly, define? each person's choice, I would guess, but some sort =
of mean in the mix).  Busch archetype, realizing any masculinity and "=
machismo" he may have been able to express is quickly fading as he pas=

Coming from the school of extreme doubt any war was ever just, possibl=
e exception was the need to put back into remission the cancer of Hitl=
er (remission, because of chronic outbreaks the world over (Pol Pot, K=
hmer Rouge), the Gulf War was just one more failure of the historical =
foreign adventurism, a waste of human and fiscal resources, an example=
 of how we may be able to trigger major environmental catastrophe just=
 by waving our spear and massing troops on the border of a very fragil=
e environmental area, from which no recovery may be expected in my lif=
e-time (48 years) or the lives of my pre-teen and young teen, maybe th=
eir children and on and on.  Of course, I see few, if any glimmers of =
support for non-violence in national politics and, not being in academ=
ic circles, and find only remnents of the once proud, if not powerful,=
 peace community and advocates that thread throughout US history.  =

Vietnam---as a Vietnam Era Vetern of those who opposed and worked agai=
nst that war, IMHO, only when the last of the generation who fought in=
 VN and/or struggled in major and minor ways against that miserable ch=
apter in US history is put to rest to mold and decay in the grave will=
 the real healing of the Nation begin.  Vietnam, I remain to this day =
obssessed by my revulsion for what the US did in that region.  I canno=
t put to rest the anger against the "government", whatever that is, an=
d , though employed by the same monster through grants most of my life=
, for the ghastly peeling away of any veneer of responsibility and lea=
dership in the areas of human rights.  Of course, the only lessons I s=
ee learned by the "establishment" is to hit the enemy with as much pow=
er as can be mustered, get in and out quickly, and keep the news media=
, both supportive of, and opposed to the action.  Keep the cover on th=
e damn thing, brag about exploits (the old body count,  just depersona=
lized and sanitized), and pin the medals on our heroes (all while cons=
idering who's body bag contained the"unknown"soldier for the effort, a=
lways wondered  if those  caskets contained real body parts, or were j=
ust filled with gravel). =


For me, the cold reminder of Vietnam, at once the most beautiful of Ma=
ll monuments, and the one that makes the most powerful statement about=
 the travesty for war and the hurt it brings to both those who lost fr=
iends and loved ones, but to the Nation as a whole.  And, it represent=
s a refreshing moment in design selection for Mall war memorials.  Des=
igned by a woman of Asian descent...such irony the latter.  May the Am=
erican Legionaires and others who opposed the building of the memorial=
 continue to choke on their own blubbering spittle.

A Dactylic Tetrameter-Based Envelope Quatrain,  Followed by a Passage of
Prose, for Kent Johnson

Kent, since you ask (though implicitly--thank you) if
I have been privileging "traditional" forms in my
efforts to encourage the writing of form-poems, I
will tell you that thanks to a long-drawn-out tiff

on the subject of form that took place on this list eighteen months ago, I
have already changed my ideas on the subject considerably.  In editing
Formal Feeling, I used a definition of formal poetry as "poems structured
by the conspicuous repetition of any language-element."  This definition
does indeed encompass many Oulipian forms and Maclovian forms, and if you
look at that book I edited you'll see that a "formal feeling" to me at that
time (1994) included chants, unmetrical rhymed forms, pun-based poems, and
in general a much broader range of forms than would be accepted by most
"new formalists" (with whom my split, if one was necessary, probably
started in the anthologizing of that book).

Since then my definition of form, as I said, has changed still further. I
found that the word "conspicuous" incited heated resistance on this very
list in the spring of 1996.  People were talking about the poems structured
by the repetition of imperceptible language elements, private forms, etc..,
as equally worthy of being called "formal."  I had a hard time with this at
first, as a lot of my own "formal feeling" has to do with the physically
perceptible, physically pleasurable repetition of language.  But finally I
did change my mind.  I found that for me the continuum of poetry,its
essential unity as a way of "forming" language, was more important than
drawing aesthetic lines in the sand (to evoke another simultaneous thread).
I began to see the other point of view, and I decided to put my new point
of view to work in the editing of a new anthology on form I was putting
together.

The new anthology (tentatively entitled An Exaltation of Forms)  ended up
including not only sections on Oulipian forms and a section by Jackson
MacLow along with sections on traditional classical and European forms and
forms of Asian, Native American, and African-American origin, but also
sections on free verse, found poetry, and other forms that have no basis in
conspicuous repetition, where the repeated element may be nothing more than
the line-break or white space. (Yes, there is a section by Anthony Hecht.
Among others by people who would be stocked in Ron's favorite bookstore--
Paul Hoover, Keith Tuma, Aldon Neilsen, Charles Bernstein.)

Simultaneously with this book, I will be publishing a collection of essays
on poetics by a similarly wide range of poets.  So you see I have, though I
know I am not typical of  new formalists and in fact no longer consider
myself to be one, been making efforts to deal with many of the questions
you raise in your sonnets.

It is significant, though, I think, that when I sent out repeated calls to
this list for people to edit sections on any "forms" of poetry at all, I
got very few responses except from people pulling out sestinas they had
hidden in the drawer.  This got me thinking that aside from MacLow and the
Oulipians (many of whose poems would in fact be formal by my original
definition, since they are structured by conspicuous repetition of
language-elements: a large number of MacLow's poems, for instance, are
chants, or else variations on forms like the triolet or pantoum that repeat
lines in varying patterns)--there is perhaps not as much to be done with
experimental forms as experimental poets would like to believe.

I would love for someone to make a lyre out of me on this issue and come up
with unconceived-of ways to arrange language into forms.  It will be too
late for the upcoming anthology--not due to any lack of trying on my
part--but maybe someone else can take over from there.

Annie

At any rate, fyi, while gender can often be determined from minimal
skeletal remains, as far as I know shit has no gender, whatever its age. I
do think that referring to women as cows is uncalled for.

This was the point I was hinting at--that proficient
performances of prosody do not equal (or even necessarily open onto)
a complex engagement with literary history or a critical grappling
with the tradition. Just the opposite is often the case, and
I suppose I _was_ suggesting that this opposite seemed generally the
case with much of the current fascination for pre-20th cent. European
forms. It's a complicated issue, to be sure, but poetic forms,
cultural products that they are, are implicated messily in history,
and part of their unfolding history (ies) also involves their use to
erase those deeper implications. I'm not making any new points here
(actually, I'm more or less glossing John Berger's arguments about
how the "use" of painting in capitalist culture contributes to a
mystification of history), but it seemed worth broaching the issue
(i.e. "what is the common dark-matter trunk of the sonnet form and
the severed head of the Tutsi child?") because some of the New
Formalist poets and their defenders at the New Criterion and
elsewhere like to give the impression that those not them are mainly
just poetasters with no serious interest in "tradition."

However,  Mac Low's "nonce-forms" are very often "applications _in
remembered texts_," and his complex systems are often laden
with resonances of tradition. Oulipean or Mac Lowean systems are, of
course, importantly arbitrary but ultimately no less so than the
application of fourteen iambic lines in three rhyming quatrains and a
couplet.

If I'm reading you right, this relates to my point about Clarke: that
there is a kind of liminality to his entering of the sonnet so as to
chisel away at it from the inside--an "overriding of basic
traits" as necessary to a revealing of the overdeterminedness of its
history. It's in that sense that I would see Clarke as arguably
writing "truer" sonnets than most of those who are quick and expert
in mimicking its prosodic rituals.

Well, actually Mark, you didn't get it, and if you keep misreading me
like this, why, I'll just have to bring up Neruda's NKVD connections
with you all over again!

My point was _the opposite_: Forms are much more than the

I think I was describing your practice, not your theory. But let's glance
at the latter for a moment. Sonnetness (to coin a barbaric neologism), you
seem to be saying, consists of a "Formal Feeling" that inheres in the poem,
and I suppose is recognizable to those with a good metaphysical ear. Or
maybe it's just sounding archaic, which perhaps is what makes the simile
"Like the ruins of a temple pounded by history" permissible.
I don't imagine that you expect anyone to be able to hear with their
material ears the sonnetness of a poem stripped of the markings of the
form. Shakespeare, au contraire, seems to have expected us to recognize
what he called a sonnet without glancing at the page to count the lines or
read the title. When Romeo crashes the Capulets' party (did I get the
family right?) he and Juliet are instantly so enmeshed that they converse
in sonnets, and any of the gentle sort would have noticed this immediately.
If the form isn't recognizable why do some poets persist in calling some of
their poems sonnets? No one writes vilanelles that are vilanelles in a
metaphysical sense, or because they "feel" like vilanelles. The sonnet has
a different kind of prestige and the idea of the sonnet a force which seems
to me to be quite different in different poets who call their unrhymed
poems sonnets. Historically it's been different enough in those who did it
the old-fashioned way. There may in fact not be a generalization derivable
from the range of such work that would be in any sense definitive.
Or maybe there is, but it better be a lot more convincing than that it
feels formal.
It's late, and I've probably misunderstood again, for which I apologize in
advance. It also grieves me that an argument many months old appears to
continue to rankle. It was in another country, and they're all dead now.

I'm not so sure I agree with this, largely because some forms are a lot
more apparant than others.  It's easy to recognize that a vilanelle has a
formal pattern.  But how about something like blank verse, which has quite
an honorable pedigree, but can (especially to someone who doesn't know
anything about scansion) be formally almost transparent?  And for a lot of
nonce forms, the pattern is even harder to find.  Sometimes a "feeling" is
all a reader has when encountering a particular form.

This is going to be a FORMless splatter into the threads on formalities
in poetry, the sonnet and so forth.

I just wrote Annie Finch the following:

"Just read your post to the Buffalo group, and hope to have the time to
reread it with care and maybe even make a CONSIDERED response to it, but
in case I don't, I did want to fire one question at you: what--in your
new view--would NOT be a formal poem?  I'm for all kinds of poetry, but
not for words that can mean anything.  My own way of dealing with this
problem is to divide poems into 'classiformular' and 'idioformular'
depending on whether their shapes follow a pattern that enough poets
have repeated to make 'classic' or whether their shapes just
"organically" and idiopathically 'grow.'"

I think all poems have form, but not formality.  Seems to me a formal
poet MUST be one who adheres to known poetic forms in his work.  But
Annie has a point in acknowledging those who consciously seek to build
new forms as opposed to poets who aren't interested in the form of what
they compose.  So I'd call the neoformalists classiformalists, and those
inventing new forms idioformalists.

Terribly touchy, difficult area, as Kent and others have pointed out.
As a taxonomist, and user of words, I want words to mean something.  So
against Kent I say if a form isn't what it's defined to be, what's the
point of naming it?  Against my against Kent, I would agree that
over-tight definitions are bad.  Even so, why then adhere to them?  Go
around them.  BUT give what you go around them to, a new name!

Back up.  I've gone through this problem (as haven't we all) many times,
particularly regaridng the haiku, where I'm on the loose side.  I began
with most beginners at haiku in the belief it ought to be three lines of
5, 7 and 5 syllables in length.  I soon realized, and was educated to
accepting, a much looser definition (partly because Japanese haiku have
punctuation-words, so to speak, that aren't pronounced--or something
like that; anyway, it's hard to compare English syllables with what's in
Japanese haiku).

A break for a contribution to the debate about orientalism.  I believe
in poetic imperialism: steal what you can use, period.  Criticize others
on their use of techniques, ideas, etc., not on whether they use them
the way some other culture does.  Though it seems permissible to point
out that someone is using a technique, ot whatever, poorly by failing to
get out of it what someother culture does.  Then quote and demonstrate
just what the other culture-people do that the criticized poet is not
doing.  So I don't think it's important to make an English haiku as
precisely as possible a duplicate except in language of a Japanese
haiku.  But to do the thing well you ought to familiarize yourself with
what those who have worked in the form the longest, the Japanese, have
done, at least in translation, and read pertinent criticism and literary
history.

If you don't follow Japanese rules in making your haiku, you ought to
call what you compose "Western Haiku," or the like.

The real problem is that you need a name that covers neither hardly
anything or just about everything.  I found "haiku" to fail to cover
lots of good short poems that had no other name.  In one case, with my
own mathematical haiku, I came up with a new name, "mathemaku."  (And I
do NOT think most of my mathemaku are very haikuic, but they have enough
of the tone, I feel, to qualify as at least ku's.)  For most haiku, I
eventually worked out a taxonomy that included "classical haiku," and
variously-named customized haiku.  Loose heading, "haiku"; very rigorous
subclass definitions.  I hope to have my haiku taxonomy at Comprepoetica
one of these days.  Can't remember my exact terms right now, or find my
essay on the subject.

I was the opposite way in a long but friendly argument with Karl Young
about sonnets.  I was with Mark Weiss down the line: you gotta have 14
rhymed iambic pentameters for a sonnet.  Since once having to change the
title of a poem I wrote about Dylan Thomas called, "Sonnet for Dylan
Thomas" for a college lit magazine because a faculty adviser said it
wasn't a sonnet (the rhyme scheme was wrong: abba cddc effe gg instead
of abab cdcd efef ff or one of the other ratified ones), I didn't care
where the rhymenants (as I call the words in rhymes) were.  I also felt
theme, octet versus sestet, or having a proper final couplet in a
Shakespearean sonnet, etc. weren't important.  Subject matter and tone
should be the last qualities to taxonomize from.  And I accepted not
near-rhymes but rim-rhymes (full rhymes except that the sound that
changes from one rhymnant to the other(s) is a vowel, as in rim/rhyme)
or backward rhymes (my invention possibly--c.1960) in which the
off-sound is the final instead of the initial sound--e.g. rim/rich.

To call 14-lines of free verse a sonnet made no sense to me for a long
time.  Karl Young wants them called "American Sonnets," meaning North
and South American, which opens another can of beans, this one
political.  If we use "American" to mean N&S American, what do we call
poems by US people, "UnitedStatesian?"  I prefer South American for
South American, North American for North American, Mexican for Mexican,
Bolivian for Bolivian, and American for United States of American.
Sorry for the imperialistic outburst, my good friends, but sometimes I
can't help myself.

Can't remember where I was, and one of the defects of cyber writing is I
can't see where I was, either, and if I scroll up to it, I won't be able
to see where I am now, and I'm too slow to be able to work without
both.  Anyway, I HAVE just about become convinced that it's okay to use
SONNET for any poem of approximately 14 lines that are approximately 10
syllables each in length--or even for poems that obviously don't in the
case of what I call "burstnorm sonnets."  I just paste my taxonomy in,
to wit:

SONGMODE SONNET               PLAINTEXT SONNET     BURSTNORM SONNET

Songmode sonnet is anything with obvious significant repetition of known
repenemes (my word for repeating verbal entities: words, phrases,
syllables, letters, etc.)  Subclasses: classical sonnet (in English; my
taxonomy, so far, applies only to English-language poetry) or 14-liner
with iambs, rhymes; blank verse sonnet (meter, no rhymes); doggerel
sonnet (rhymes, no meter); trochaic sonnet; dactylic sonnet; extended
sonnet (over 14 lines); unfinished sonnet (under 14 lines); etc.

Plaintext Sonnet: conventional freeverse sonnet

Burstnorm Sonnet (which could be in freeverse, which is why I coined
"plaintext" above rather than went with "freeverse"): visual sonnet
(which might have four freeverse lines of text and ten drawings);
skeletel sonnet (one or two words per line); and so forth at the
ingenuity of the poet, with the only restriction being that somehow the
classical sonnet is referred to.  Generally such poems are so clearly
NOT classical sonnets that there is no confusion; like calling a musical
composition a poem.

I justify the loose definition of the sonnet as, basically, "short
poem," on the grounds that (1) no good term is available for, say, the
conventional freeverse sonnet; (2) "sonnet" in English, did mean any
short lyric for a time; (3) one can adjectivize the term to make
distinctions clear.

On the other hand, I sort like calling only classical sonnets sonnets,
and call songmode variations of them "dissonnets," and plaintext sonnets
"nonnets."  "Metasonnets" would be the term of choice for burstnorm
sonnets.

That's it for now.  I hope my comments will be taken as a blur of ideas
to consider, not as an argument.  I hope they make sense.  Meanwhile, do
get out to COMPREPOETICA.  Even I now have a bio there, so there's no
excuse not to send me yours!

                                                Best to all, Bob G.

And I once wrote a series of 140-syllable prose poems and called them
sonnets.  Read some at a reading and Ken Irby complained audibly at the
classification, as he was right to do.

But, still, they are sonnets.

The new Sulfur (#41) contains, as always, a generous stash of
mind-expanding substances, but check out, in particular, Lorine
Niedecker's "calendar poem" sequence, discovered by Jenny Penberthy
among Zukofsky's papers at Texas. What a find, and Penberthy's
introductory essay is very fine as well. The holograph on the
calendar is reproduced, day by day, too.

On a different note, I've had the good fortune recently to be in
touch with the Uruguayan visual poet Clemente Padin, one of Latin
America's great experimentalists, and he passed on some website
addresses where his work can be found (along with, I'm sure, all
kinds of other interesting stuff), so I thought I'd share them:

On the Padin URLs, I've checked a few and I'm not having any luck
getting them to come up. The only one that responds is the
"geocities" one, which I think is Karl Young's site, but what I get
is a sunset-sky backdrop and poem entitled JESUS LOVES YOU, with two
virtual crucifixes doing slow-motion spins at the top. Has Karl Young
been born again?

If anyone has the correct URL for the Young site, I'd appreciate
knowing. Also checked the "ubuweg" site, but Padin's work doesn't
seem to be currently on there, so perhaps the addresses are no
longer current--sorry.

If I knew nothing about dogs except the names of breeds that I'd read in
books I might be able to tell the difference between a poodle and a
dalmation because one felt like a poodle, etc. That's why experts judge the
dog shows.
Which is not to say that it's always illegitimate to call a poem a sonnet
that lacks most of the formal signals that have classically defined
"sonnet." There are some rather good poems of this kind that convincingly
or meaningfully use the term. Why that's so for a given poem requires a lot
more precise investigation than saying it "feels" like a sonnet. The
designation as sonnet could be read as a part of the poem in a different
sense than it was for Shakespeare or Keats.
A propos, the sonnet has a mixed history. After the craze that lasted over
a century in England, from the 1520's to 1650's, it almost disappeared. By
Milton's maturity, in fact, it had lost most of its popularity. Wordsworth
brought it back into the mainstream, and it was a major form for the
romantics. Hopkins is the only significant Victorian practitioner. Various
Edwardians toyed with it, but it wasn't (am I right?) until the late 40's
that it gained its current guarded prestige. Another thing to ponder.

Judy Roitman spoke of her "140-syllable prose poems" that she calls
sonnets.  My taxonomical claim is that there is a difference between
prose and poetry--prose not having flow-breaks.  But prose with a
specified syllable length is something I'll have to think about.  I
guess you could call it a one-line poem with a line-break (a kind of
flow-break in my taxonomy) after 140 syllables.

I tend to think one flow-break isn't enough, though. . . .

Just tried this URL (I'v been there once before (would you believe I've seen El
Dorado too?)): I was told the first time that it didn't exist, and after trying
again, I was able to get in. The N.H. conference reports are on the home page
split into two columns ( "Conference on the left" and "Conference on the
Right"). The Conference on the left is the one of interest for those who have
been to the conference or want to know about it. The essay isn't that long --
maybe it can be pasted onto a list posting? Don't know what else to say there
except watch those web wormholes: you may end up like Alice in a land of
nonce-sense.

This weekend I went to a prayer protest.

They built this highway here. It is called the H3. It is the third
highway on Oahu. It took 30 years to build. Many people protested. The
highway is useless. It goes from one unpopulated place to another
unpopulated place that only the military would want to go. It goes
through much pristine land and over many sacred places. (Archeologists
and anthropologists have a bad name here. They often say the places are
not important.) IT is said that a woman came at one point during the
building of the highway and cursed the highway and then the next day two
people died. This caused a great controversy about how people should
respond to the highway. Part of the resistance to the highway being
built was to say that you would be hurt if you worked on the highway,
and now if you drive, b/c the gods of the land are angry; many times the
state called out kahunas to bless the highway to try to get rid of the
fears. It didn't work really. People were still hurt. The state did
other things like try to offer "educational tours" to try to convince
people it was ok to build this highway. Remember in this context that
Hawaii is addicted to construction funds, federal ones especially. Think
of Hawaii as a junky when the city is dry; funds are drying up and
everything is going bad and there is cramping. Also consider that Hawaii
has a huge car problem. More cars per capita than LA. It is hard to
drive. Sometimes it is hard to drive over 30 mph on the H1 b/c of
traffic (and this road does nothing to end that at all). Also consider
that Hawaii walks hand in hand with the military in a way more obvious
here than in other states.

Maybe Susan or Rob Wilson could explain this better than me since they
have lived through more of it. I might have certain facts wrong. This is
all hearsay. I am a mainland haole newcomer.

Anyway, people were arrested numerous times trying to block the
building. Now the highway is done. A group of Native Hawaiians were
blessing the highway b/c they felt the sins of the military industrial
complex should be forgiven. They were doing this in front of a private
ceremony for the mayor and other investment people.

So this woman organized a counter blessing. She said we were not to
curse the Hawaii or the state blessers of the highway. It was small--12
people ("native Hawaiians" the tv said in their coverage--but I'm not
sure anyone had blood quantum). There is some sort of spot that this
woman has gotten declared "cultural lands" and she and her husband and
child (all self-identified as hapa) were camping there with another guy
who identified as Hawaiian. There was also a haole guy who had gone
native. Gabrielle (Welford), Charles, and me (all haole). And then four
other people who self-identified as Asian Amer. One with dreadlocks and
one with a funny beard that grew only underneath his chin.

You had to go up through a cement factory and then down this access road
that had a gate on it. The guards (there were at least three) didn't
want to let us through but then he did after we kept saying we were
allowed and we had to park our cars at the bottom and he drove us up in
the back of his pickup. While Charles and I were waiting Gabrielle drove
up. That helped some.

It was very beautiful there. And quiet except for the busses that kept
taking people up and down the highway (someone said you could buy a
ticket and be driven on the highway in a bus before it opened but the
news said it was investors--either way someone in Hawaii manages to sell
everything). The news kept calling the highway Hawaii's most beautiful
drive--I haven't been on it yet. It goes through places most people have
never seen before.

They did an ava (?) ceremony (some sort of drug that makes you tired,
that is ceremonial) in the middle of the access road beneath the H3
where previously a sacred place had been. The ava, or however it is
spelled, was a powder that the haole guy made. It was Halawa ava (is it
awa?). We were in the Halawa valley. (This is where my cats stayed
during quarantine.) The ava was soaked in water. And then some more was
put in a cloth bag and it was stirred in the water for a long time. Then
each person was given a cup of the ava to drink. Each person paused upon
receipt of the cup, threw some of the liquid to the ground, and then
drank it. Then everyone clapped three (?) times. The guards were given
ava also. Some drank. Some tasted.

The woman and her husband and the haole guy gone native all felt very
familiar to me. They had been fighting the highway for over six years,
had gotten arrested numerous time, knew all the policemen who were
"guarding" us during the entire ceremony in full dress, with guns, stun
guns, etc. The police made a racket when they walked. It was colder out
so they didn't look as stupid as they could have in full gear guarding a
bunch of sad people on a hot day. The policemen thing was interesting.
Some would take off their hats when they came and drank ava and some
refused and kept chattering during the ceremony. People kept getting up
and telling them to be quiet or to turn off their cars.

The whole thing was interesting in terms of thinking about what is
protest. I think only here would you have someone blessing the highway
and then have someone blessing back in protest. It makes me think in a
new way that the blessing would be given so much credit. But also an
interesting way of thinking about how we live our lives. I'm trying to
figure out how we figure our lives as active participants in things (is
it service learning? is it prayer protest? is it bombing?). Often here
culture and politics coincide (Hawaiian immersion schools; hula; taro
planting; etc.). Many people actively involved in politics here are also
poets: Huanani Kay Trask is the obvious one.

The next day Bill and I were at a coffee shop and someone there was
claiming to be the sister in law of the person who had the first
accident on H3. She hit a cone and it flew up and hit her car.

well, let's see now --

"No one writes villanelles that are villanelles
in a metaphysical sense   or because they feel
like villanelles" -- say what?  Were villanelles

not a singular lyric quid as their brassy knells
of rhyme & such regular thrusts of lines (like steel)
would chime fell stateliness:  war villanelles

so to say -- id est: an ecstatic death's wot sells
(in a metaphysical sense) -- not that you'd keel
& crumple at the thrice-struck word . . . brrr! Villanelles

are as cool as hell! -- or so warm as oven-swells
in the  ocean-whelms of bread whose butter'd heel
flips agile or gangs agley --  eck -- yar, villanelles

we's gots 'em if yer wants 'em -- nothing dispells
any dour mode or some dire mood   or a spiel
(in a metaphysical sense) like Her villanelles

(rather Gravsian for a giddy kid) -- propels
(does the form) a certain jeu n'est se qua-ish eel
that doth slither in trance (exuant): are villanelles
what erstwhile (meta-fizz-ically) were villanelles?

I mean, are they?

It semeth me that one can study *old* Japanese forms, hokku, waka, etc.
(although I would make a case for renga as having transcended its
historical moment) while simply recognizing it as such--I don't believe
a Japanese student of Chaucer would be left with the impression that
the English *now* go around saying things like "Tehe, quod she, and clapte
the window to."

It semeth me as well that the deliberate holes in Yasusada pointed out in
Perloff's excellent essay--the Paul Celan anachronism, for example--make
the whole project *more* interesting to me than an actual slavish
imitation of then-current forms.

Shameless Self-Promotion #673

I just wanted to remind list-travelers who find themselves in the
Pacific Northwest this week that the Subtext Reading Series features
Dorothy Trujillo Lush and myself at the Speakeasy Cafe, 2304 2nd Ave.,
Belltown, this Thursday evening at 7:30.

Bruce Andrews said of Dorothy's work: "Writing, here, can initiate a not
so softened horizon: exsentimental flying saucers of evidence, severely
outside."

Bruce didn't say that about my work. I'm still working on "the
theoretical impasse in Language poetry / avant garde formations" (has
anyone ever noticed that the mistaken posts on the list are sometimes
more interesting than the intentional ones?) But let's see -- I heard
that Bob Grenier, Joanne Kyger and a few other poets read my latest poem
out loud around a Bolinas dinner table last weekend . . . (I dunno --
anyone got Creeley's number? Maybe I can hit him up for a blurb . . .)

I agree with David Israel's statement that such a program is only as good as
its creators, but it is also only as good as its users.  I have often
marveled at bizarrely inappropriate and sometimes hilarious word choices in
papers from my students, especially from non-native speakers of English, and
then finally figured out that they used a thesaurus but did not recognize
divergent meanings or usages.

there's always o'hara's *personism:  a manifesto.*  and there is a great

i'd look at prefaces, forewords, etc, to anthologies that came out late
60s-early 70s, Black Fire, No More Masks!, Understanding the New Black
Poetry, ,Time, to Greez, etc., what we now call "identitarian" anthologies.
often the anthologizing gesture itself served as a kind of manifesto.  md

The Four Horsemen wrote a manifesto called _for a poetry of blood_ which is
worth checking out, unfortunately I don't know how you can access it but if
you backchannel I will send a photocopy of my copy to you. The Toronto
Research Group have one extant manifersto of two that were written--first
one was lost--that is reprinted in _Rational Geomancy_ (talon books, 1992).

An offshoot from the original Zaum movement in pre-revolutionary Russia
(began approx 1913). The main focus remains the same, the idea of
neologistic creations in all media & the preempting of all existing
culture codes.  The future must be continually invented by a pool of
thoroughly trained imaginators. The 2 words which were originally
adopted to describe were "beyonsense" & "trans-rational" both of which
suggest a conviction toward the removal of all cultural & global
barriers.



HYPER ZAUM MANIFESTO

1. An expression of abstract musicality--"papier musique" for deafness.

2. Coloration of negative primary values. Retro-semiotics turned on
itself.

3. Every imagination deconstructs the code.  No mind the dissertation of
marks.

4. An alphabet of centuries & a cross-section of graphist articulations.

5. Visual Poetry factory hands rise & revolt.  Oppression is beneath all
great art.

6. All wild leaps of fancy still land on earth.

From 1986-90 The Avant Garde Museum of Temporary Art collected artist
manifestos as an ongoing mailart project.  The project was called
Maniments & Movifestos & in that time collected more than 90 manifestos
from around the globe.  We have a hypercard stack that documents what is
included in the archive (this stack contains some of the short
manifestos) & have half a file drawer of material that we collected
pertaining to the call to make manifestos.

If anyone is innerested in that stack (mac only) I can easily email it
to you.  It is about an 80K file.

For a paper I'm considering writing on manifestos, I'm wondering whether
anyone on the list could suggest a literary/artistic manifesto -- N.
American, say from the period 1960 to the present day -- which would be
worth
investigating.

Or has anyone on the List written a manifesto?  Would be curious to see it.

But you have to trace all of these back to Bob Kaufman's "Abomunist
Manifesto"--my dissection of the pseudonym "Bomkauf" and the use of the
word "frink" made me perhaps the only person in the history of the program
to make a literary reference to P-Funk on a master's exam--

You might try some pieces written by Ronald Sukenick and  Raymond
Federman; in the 1970s they produced a number of manifestos for pomo
fiction (or surfiction).  I'm thinking, in particular, of
"Surfiction--Four Propositions in Form of an Introduction" (Federman)
and "The New Tradition in Fiction" (Sukenick).  Both are in
_Surfiction: Fiction Now and Tomorrow_.  Sukenick's also got a number
of good essays in his collection, _In Form_.

Best,

Dear Jacques,

In 1983 I edited an issue of WASHINGTON REVIEW titled
MANIFESTOS. It contained new manifestos by Jackson Mac
Low, George Myers, Jr., John Perreault, Nina Zivancevic,
Bernadette Mayer, Charles Bernstein, Terence Wince,
DiC. artist Brian Kavanaugh, Charles and James Wine, Joe
Ross, Bruce Andrews, Tina Darragh, Claude Ricochet, Susan
Laufer, Sally Silvers, Jean-Paul Curtay, and others.
I also wrote a "Statement on Manifestos," which I later
read at the MLA.

You might want to take a look at that.

  Imagine the person -- have their photo or draw a crude picture, just for
this purpose.

  Light a white candle. Have a glass of drinking water next to you.

  Imagine that you are surrounded with with white light. Smudge your
surroundings.

  Surround their image with white light, even if you think they are full
of dirty, evil energy. The white light will seal their psychic toxicity so
it won't leak out.

  Pour salt on their image, as much as you want.

  Say aloud:

    "I am cleansed from their wrongdoings and I ask the universe to help
    them find a way back to truth, honor and integrity."

  Blow the salt away. Drink the water and blow out the candle.

  Throw out the picture (do not burn it).

Miekal And wants to know if "'xeroxial' (has) a place in the bob grumman
school of taxonomy?"  Of course!  Everything, as Miekal MUST know, has a
place in my taxonomy.  Actually, "xeroxial" would have two places, one
under "visualloyic poetry" (to wit: "xeroxial visualloyic poetry") and
one under "visiocollagic poetry" (to wit "xeroxial visiocollagic
poetry"--or, better, "xerollagic poetry," from Miekal's own term,
"xerollage," which I probably spelled wrong; I might've spelled my OWN
terms wrong, too).  Both time the adjective means composing with a
copier, the product acknowledging its copiedness to fulfill various
expressive purposes.  I'd use it with "textual illumagery, too" and
probably in other places.

So, Miekal, when are you and Liz gonna fill out a Comprepoetica survey
form?

Hello poetix, ebr has yet to be finished and I would like to
assure that there is no bias against the Pacific Rim - -
at least that I've seen in internal communiques. Not all of the
essays are yet debugged - - ebr # 6 is not lost, rather waiting,
ether being a convenience in this case for limbo.  But there is
a reprieve; I'll post to here when it's ready to go.  Apologies
to all that've had cause to doubt their own when presented with
404's.

This is Kevin Killian.  As a surprise for the poet Kathleen Fraser, whose
book of selected poems "Il cuore: the heart" appeared in September, Mary
Margaret Sloan began a kind of chain letter soliciting tributes, memoirs,
poems, essays, etc., and these were all compiled and presented to her at
the close of her reading here in San Francisco on Sunday at Canessa Park.
Dozens and dozens of them, and probably many of you on this list were among
those who responded to Sloan's "Chain of Hearts" appeal.  Simultaneously
Dodie Bellamy and I surprised Fraser by distributing a special issue of our
zine "Mirage #4/Period[ical]" (#74) filled with many of these tributes and
what have you that Margy had shared with us.  Well, it was a total surprise
to Kathleen Fraser and tears started up in her eyes.  We have a few copies
of this left over and if you'd like one let me know (back channel) please.

Hey Kevin,

Hope you & Dodie are well.  I'd like one of these Fraser issues if you've
still got some, a minute or two after sending your message to the list.

Thanks a lot.  Hope you have a great new year.

Bests,

Jacques,

There is a new-formalist manifesto from the early 80s you might want to
look at:  the introduction to the anthology Expansive Poetry. There was
also a magazine called The Reaper, edited by Robert McDowell and Mark
Jarman, in the 70s, that was full of manifestoes.   As a post-formalist, I
am rather embarrassed by these (!) , but if you want another sort of
manifesto to look at you might find them useful.

I am also writing one myself, but it's not done yet.

 Yup--It's an all-male issue; maybe I should wait till other poets submit
some stuff to me....But nobody did this time around. Hopefully that'll
change.  Hint hint....

hey all, remember when we used to post what we were reading? here's my
end-of-quarter catch-as-catch-can listing:

john wieners 707 scott st, just my cup of tea! loneliness, poetry, drugs,
anonymous sex and religion; reminds me of russell fitz-g's
obsessed-w-bob-kaufman diary from the same period. thank you for publishing
this douglas messerli!!

chas bernstein's article for daedalus, called "a blow is like an
instrument." cute and engaging, w/ lenny bruce gig and all, a real pleasure
to see that in a "serious" humanities rag. one q, though, is in his
thumbnail precis of the yasusada brouhaha he refers to "the poem itself."
is there any such thing, is what i'd like to know.  obviously i think not.
charles's discussion is framed in terms of questions, so i'm not imputing
certainty to him, but the phrase "the poem itself" can function, in current
academic climate, as a gauntlet of aestheticism thrown down in a gesture
that erases almost all post-'68 thinking in the humanities.

a heavy dose of barrett watten, after his ILS tour de force.  no comment yet.

a ms on gertrude stein for a univ. press. no comment yet.

snippets of Puerto Rican Jam (U of MN Press), a group of essays by young PR
scholars mostly sociology etc, and Nestor Garcia Canclini's book abt
entering and leaving modernity, what's it called? slipped my mind. it's in
the other room. the former not as helpful as i'd thot it wd be, the latter
very interesting, esp the foreword by renato rosaldo.

hoping to delve into hannah weiner and nate mackey more thoroughly during
my upcoming single quarter leave YAY!--md

told it was the "longest word in the english language."

Dear List,
What sad news of Kathy Acker's death!
What a Great Poetic and Sexual Terrorist!
She is such an Iconic Force -
a major Permission Giver for so many readers and writers -
like hearing Patti Smith in  P.J. Harvey, or the Breeders,
In those coming after-
May Her
Logo-Poetic
Collage Epic
Rock On!

Isn't there something inherently ridiculous about manifestos?  I'm thinking
back to the discussion of avant-gardes and border-keeping apparatuses, and
the notion that if there isn't an avant-garde anymore, then what are all
these manifestos doing?

A manifesto is more than just an essay stating "this is what I believe in,"
it is an act of hubris, the difference between trying to talk to someone at
a party and trying to talk to everyone at the party, at the same time, so
that they all have to sleep with you when you're done speaking.  If they
are anything, manifestos are ardent.

As such manifestos have become a form of camp, to be read primarily with
irony, because their theatricality makes it impossible to take their
grandstanding seriously or literally.  The "Ismist Manifesto" is a good
illustration of this.

This irony defeats the manifesto's original intent:  it's hard to take
seriously someone you're laughing at.  At the supposed core of any
manifesto is an idea, a principle, an article of faith, that the writer and
signers of said manifesto not only believe in, but wish to persuade others
that they should believe in it too.  But if there are no borders left to
maintain, then the manifesto's assertion of borders is laughable.  What
started as an important and necessary statement of principles (if this was
ever true: a golden age where manifestos mattered might just be another
form of nostalgia) has degenerated into a comic exercise.

On the other hand, wouldn't the advent of something new tend to create new
borders along with it, the way a rock thrown in the water makes waves?
A manifesto is something like a trumpet fanfare; not just a statement of ideas
but a statement nailed to the church door.  There is of course something
excessive, outrageous, silly about it - but something new always seems
extra or out of place.  Aren't most works of art examples of just
such anomalous, excessive unexpectedness?

The real irony of manifestos is not that they're irrelevant in a milieu without
borders; it's that the excessive or aggressive aspect of the manifesto is
a calculated attempt to win over or be accepted - both more calculating
and collaborating (with the public) than the artwork itself (if the art's
really new.  I'm not saying newness is a great criterion of value, either.)

manifesto are recursive ideologues,  manifestos generate manifestos.

Speaking of the ILS, who is still laughing over some of the entries In
"The Dictionary of Received Ideas"? And they say the avant-garde (or

Dear Jacques:
        I can think of a number of N. American visual artist/poets who have
written manifestos: Dick Higgins, Clemente Padin,  b.p. nichol, Steve
McCaffery, d.a.levy, Miekal And ... (I vaguely remember something Opal
Nations wrote about a possible but non-existent art movement -- maybe David
Bromige could recall this). I'll look up some titles and backchannel when I
can.
        It will be intersting to see where your investigations lead. Has
the body of work lived up to the manifesto? Was the manifesto heard or did
it fall in a central Idaho forest with no human near? What's the ratio of
political content/intent to aesthetic?  Best, crag hill

For an extremely subtle and nuanced view of the manifesto check out Steve
Evans's ILS lecture 1.1 "The Dynamics of Literary Change."  There he treats,
as implicitly a manifesto, several passages of Hegel's from the preface to
*Phenomonology of Spirit* ("Hegel's whole point being" that there is little
difference between manifesto and phenomonology).  By way of Jean-Luc Nancy
there is also this provocative attack on historicism:  "Historicism in
general is the way of thinking that *presupposes* that history has always
already begun, and that therefore it always merely continues [whereas] it is
precisely the question of beginning, of inaugurating or entering history that
should constitute the core of the thinking of history."  "The new," Evans
writes, " is not one thing, the old another. They have meaning only in their
diacritical relations to one another" though the "*relation* is . . . an
antagonistic one."  Concerning the new, however, it is not so much a question
of time as it is the *timeliness* which "captures the way in which elements
of a cultural system are inflected by their history even within the relative
synchrony of a given epoch."

As is suggested by Evans's example from Hegel, manifestos take other forms --
particularly at the present time -- in prefaces, introductions, etc.  -- See
for instance John Yau's treatment of Moxley's preface to her *Imagination
Verses* as a manifesto at: HTTP://WWW-POLISCI.MIT.EDU.BOSTONREVIEW/

Craig knows this, I'm sure, but just to clarify that Clemente Padin
is not "Norh American" but Uruguayan--one of Latin America's most
important visual/experimental poets (and important theoretician of
the word as well). I have begun to correspond with Padin about the
possibility of a North American book retrospective of his work,
including a selection of his essays and manifestos.

If anyone out there knows Clemente or has relevant information about
his multi-faceted work, his impact, etc. please do contact me.

I'll be out of town from today through Jan. 4.  Feliz Navidad to all!

this might be a stupid question, but Ive recently become interested in
the japanese visual poetry & hypermedia scene via the internet, but the
sites are almost impossible to view because netscape is language
specific.  I dont read a word of japanese but Id like to see the sites
as they were intended.  my question is there anyway to configure
netscape to read kanji if I have the font in my system or do I have to
use the japanese version of netscape?

experimedia simplexity: a manifesto festering

every artist creates from the comfortable edge of their domain, trying,
pushing, retreating, conjuring specimens that can be called their own.
when I began my mature work some 10 years ago i was convinced that every
discovery I made was my own & that I in essence possessed those ideas,
those creations & in a non-interactive vacuum perhaps this could be the
reality....  however with the beginning of the xerox network
(inknowingly the mutant child of the mimeo revolution of the 60's) in
the 80's it became possible for any energetic artist to interface
his/her work internationally & have that visual/verbal information
assimilated in the global mind.  instant, cheap printing has meant that
every artist is a participating publisher/artist & that for really the
first time in history the artist is in some control of the media they
create.  the notion of self-publishing is no longer an exercise in
vanity but an integral link in fostering multiple strata of
instantaneous culture.

here is where the quibbling begins, because we are faced with notions of
aesthetics & communication which are more than a 100 years old & except
for the experimental front there has been little reconciliation between
the culture & what it has become & how rapidly it is permutating & the
consequent art which is created.

poetry & fiction have been replaced by "the text" & the practice of any
art has enlarged to intimacy with all arts, with an investigation into
the culture beneath the culture.  because information & ideas are
bombarding our sphere so rapidly the procedure of invention &
experimentation is simultaneous with instant printing, rapid
communication & the chameleon quality of the artist.  more appropriate
terms for new art may be velocity, impact, shifting, compounding, etc
rather than "this is a good poem, that's a bad painting."  utility &
erotics, perhaps are closer specifics.  the sensations received & its
usefulness completely bypass the critical facility until it becomes more
than an unconscious reaction....

altho my work in publishing, performance, music & art are considered on
the edge of the avant-garde, the whole notion of an avant-garde has
pretty much been exhausted, if anything, this is the century of the
avant-garde & the creations of the future have become demystified to the
point of becoming commonplace, yet necessary.  so instead there are
those artists which have accepted stasis, repeating over & over the
certainty of their statement & there are those artists who shed skin
after skin, retaining the wisdom of the past experience but learning to
accept an unending onslaught of information & culture.  I liken stasis
to living death, change to death & birth.

how many lives will it take to say what is yet to be said?

read thru this essay & my first reaction is that I am surprised by what
seems to be a real change of heart about hypermedia, the visual text &
pure form versus intermedia constructions.  I would say that based on
this text you could become a very convincing hypermedia salesman.  why
just 10 years ago I remember feeling like just such a salesman when
talking with you.  am I imagining such a change has taken place & if it
has I would love to know more about what informs this change.

Netscape 3 should have it under document encoding - you need to have the
script inside your computer (it's easy on Macs) - the new Netscape
apparently can read it - we just hear this. Here, the Mac has a lot of
scripts that do the translations.

Reading report from Honolulu, two.

In November, Joe Balaz’s journal the Oahu Review held a reading (I’m not
sure how much this journal costs because those who attended the reading
got a free copy and it doesn’t have a price in it but I imagine any sort
of reasonable donation would get you a copy of this “multicultural
literary publication of Hawai’i.” Send to: Iron Bench Press Box 44
Ka’a’awa, Hawai’i 96730.). ‘Imaikalani Kalahele, T.M. Lafferty, Tony
Quagliano, red flea (who also appeared as Richard Hamasaki), Susan
Schultz, and Kathryn Waddell Takara among others read. Quagliano really
stuck out at this reading because he read a poem about Bamboo Ridge that
was so angry it made the audience gasp. I didn’t take notes so don’t
quote me but I seem to remember it saying things like the writers of
Bamboo Ridge should stop being such babies. It was dedicated to Wing Tek
Lum. Quagliano accused him of being the only Bamboo Ridge poet that
mattered. I realized at this reading that I like red flea’s poems better
on the page because they get too serious when he reads them and lose
their playful, biting attacks. He has a chapbook and c.d. out on Tinfish
which is worth checking out. (Some interesting local poetry trivia is
that Susan Schultz and red flea grew up in the same town in Virginia.) I
also realized what a good story teller Kalahele is (he is also a painter
and local activist). Also notable about this reading was the impressive
spread of food afterwards. In fact there is excellent food at many
readings in Hawaii. It puts the free wings at CPG in Buffalo to shame.

Also in November Kilali Alailima, Taueva Fa’otusia, Mary Tuti Baker,
Ruth Tuiteleleapaga, Luafata Simanu-Klutz, and Dr. Papali’i Failautusi
Avegalio read at a reading for Samoan, Tongan, and Hawaiian writers. It
was held leeward side at Poka’i Bay. It really was paradise to sit on
the grassy beach and hear things read outloud and the ocean at the same
time and then eat some breadfruit afterwards. The reading was hours long
but no one complained. It was such a nice location that I forgot to
write anything about it in my notebook so I can’t be very specific. But
I remember Tuiteleleapaga’s writing the clearest. She read some sparse,
well-written stories about going home to Samoa after living in New York
and dealing with her father. And I think, but I’m not positive, that it
was Dr. Papali’i Failautusi Avegalio who read the story for children
that argued that DNA tests suggest that the Mayans and northwestern
Native Americans might be descended from Polynesians.

December started with Normie Salvador and Cabaret Tiki reading together.
Salvador read a lot of heavily rhythmic poems that were part sci-fi,
part deep image. He is interested in synesthesia. It was hard to hear
him and a member of the audience used this an excuse for some local
style chiding. The rest of the audience seemed a little embarrassed to
have to be a part of this. When he read his next poem and asked if
anyone could hear it, everybody clapped enthusiastically. Salvador also
spoke of how many times people accuse him of writing poems that could
have been written on the mainland because he doesn’t write in pidgin.
Then he read a poem he wrote in pidgin. He also did a lot of preaching
between poems. And boy was Cabaret Tiki a surprise. With a name like
that one would expect lots of boas to be worn. But instead it was a
large group of younger men and women in those ever popular muted aloha
shirts doing comedy sketches. Two sketches stood out. One called “Haole
Go Home” (I don’t think I can begin to describe the complicated nuances
in this piece and I’m not even sure I got them all because I’ve only
been here five months and still feel out of things local a lot of the
time) and then another called “How to Raise a Successfully Asian Child.”
Both had the audience laughing hard but Douglas Rothschild, visiting
from New York, found them racist. When I discussed them with him later,
I had that I can’t possibly explain what is going on here in Hawaii to
anyone in terms that make any sense. I think the necessary vocabulary is
missing or something. But it has something to do with the cliché of
Hawaii being both a paradise of cross-racial communication and community
and at the same time openly racist.

The next night we held a small unannounced and spontaneous poetry
reading and picnic at Sans Souci beach for Douglas. Bill made pizza and
Charles made cole slaw (but the cole slaw got left at home in the
refrigerator by accident) and we brought some beers. (I didn't make
anything!) Susan brought a pie and Bryant brought some cookies and
Gabrielle brought some muffins, jam, and cream. In the dark, with all of
us a little high on too much sugar, we first looked at the aligned
planets and then listened to Douglas read poems from Matchbox (New York:
Situations, 1997).

And then ending December, Alison Deming (visiting UH,M from Tucson) read
poems about butterflies, flora and fauna, indigenous tourism, and things
like “the sweet togetherness of women.” She likes the word science and
says it with emphasis when it appears in her poems. One of her students
introduced her reading with such love, devotion, and humor that it was
touching.

I think next on the slate is that the local IWW chapter is having a
reading, music, and sharing of food gathering on December 23 but I’m
going to be on my way to Raleigh, North Carolina so I will miss it.
Maybe someone else will report in.

From the artists' collective/studio/gallery/electro-art centre called V2 in
the Netherlands:

Manifesto for the Unstable Media

We strive for constant change; for mobility.
We make use of the unstable media, that is, all media which make use of
electronic waves and frequencies, such as engines, sound, light, video,
computers, and so on.
Instability is inherent to these media.

Quantum mechanics has proved, among other things, that the smallest
elementary particles, such as electrons, exist in ever-changing forms.
They have no stable form, but are characterized by dynamic mobility. This
unstable, mobile form of the electron is the basis of the unstable media.

The unstable media are the media of our time. They are the showpieces in
our modern homes. We promote their comprehensive use, instead of the often
practised misuse of these media.

We love instability and chaos, because they stand for progress. We do not
see chaos as survival of the fittest, but as an order which is composed of
countless fragmentary orders, which differ among themselves and within
which the prevailing status quo is only a short orientation point.

The unstable media move within the concepts of 'movement-time-space', which
implies the possibility of combining more forms and contents within one
piece of work. The unstable media reflect our pluriform world.

Unstable media are characterized by dynamic motion and changeability, this
in contrast with the world of art which reaches us through the publicity
media. This has come to a standstill and has become a budget for
collectors, officials, historians and critics.

Art must be destructive and constructive.

*** Londoners hear Eliot poem amid damp ruins

What would induce Londoners to line up for a show in a damp, derelict
theater as temperatures drop below freezing? The surprising answer is
American-born T.S. Eliot's famous poem "The Waste Land." The show has
sold out every night this week at an abandoned Victorian music hall,
the oldest of its kind in the world, which has been gathering dust
and cobwebs since 1880. The popularity of a poetry reading amid
London's dazzling array of musicals and plays is all the more
surprising near Christmastime, when many theatres are abuzz with
glitzy offerings. See

On the Mac, it is not enough just to set document encoding to one of the
Japanese standards in your browser, you must also have at least one
Japanese font installed on your system and also the latest Worldscript
extensions and also (I think, although maybe the font and worldscript are
enough) the 'Japanese Language Kit' (you'd definitely need the latter for
*inputting/editing* Japanese.

The situation is basically the same for Chinese (excepty you need Chinese
fonts, etc.) on the Mac, which is where I have direct experience.

I am not so clear about how Wintel copes.

Pierre Joris asked abt. Floridian literature -- did you ask only for poetry?

After many years I'm just starting to re-read Denis Johnson's novel
*Fiskadoro* (1985; Vintage Contemporaries), and enjoying same   It's set in
a post-apocalypse South Florida.

For poetry vis-a-vis FL, Robert Creeley's longish poem of a couple years ago
comes to mind -- though I don't know if (or where) this may've appeared in
print.  (Of course, his vantage was that of the visitor . . . )

I've enjoyed some work by Florida poet Susan Mitchell -- some of the
*Rapture* poems were (for me) a good bit easier to get into than the
subsequent *The Will to Adore* (I think is the title).  Long ago, also read
from Mitchell's first volume, *The Water Inside the Water* (Wesleyan I
think) -- but not certain whether she was a Floridian at that point.
Florida & its landscapes does figure in some fine poems in *Rapture*.  I'd
imagine Mitchell might be esteemed overly mainstream [the M word, as 'twere]
-- whether in manner, or in publishing history, could be a hemi-question) to
interest some current company, but would also suppose that such membranes
remain semi-permeable.  Perhaps Mitchell can be thought of as a post-Stevens
poet.

anyway, bon voyage --

Subject:      recommended drudgery

I see in the new _Dictionary of Received Ideas_ from ILS (which undoubtedly
will become the indispensable reference tool for double-edged young shavers
and sitting-on-the-fencing masters alike), that the definition for
"prosody" is "The secret of the art is lost."  This is pretty accurate,
and reminded me of the incredibly thorough entry on "prosody" in another
reference work, the good old Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry & Poetics.
It ain't Saintsbury, & it ain't countin on your fingers, Jack. Well worth
perusing.

Another entry worth slogging through is the one on "Verse & Prose".  I
would particularly recommend this one to Bob Grumman, who was wondering
on here recently how to catalog prose poetry in his system.  One of
the comments in "V & P" is that lineated, metrical verse is actually
closer to speech than prose is, and that drama only became thoroughly
prosaic with the hegemony of the novel. I thought this was an interesting
comment with implications for anybody who wants to write verse plays.
We all know drama became prosaic in the 18-19th cent. - but that spoken
lang. has closer affinities with verse than prose is worth thinking about.
The big push in American 20th cent. poetry to bring "the virtues of prose"
into poetry, in various ways, might have missed somethin.  Do we's all
know dis already?  Am's I borin' you?

I think the piece you're referring to was in _Parnassus_, but I don't have
the exact citation.

Also interesting to me here are the implications for verse plays. No doubt that
drama (as it has been known) has become prosaic, but my thought is that the
prosaic drama of the now is not the prosaic drama of the 19th century for
reasons contra those of the dictionary. As the "V & P" entry said, it was the
hegemony of the novel that brought this about (a statement I can take two ways
I think). I'm just unsure of metrical verse being closer to speech than prose.
Like "mainstream" verse, drama certainly appears to have gone from verse to
prose: in this case "prose-aic."  We are seeing the comeback of verse into
prose now too. A lot is being done now in drama, or has been done with verse
plays that is anything but prosaic. This is mostly because the language of the
original works, or translations are in remade language. I am thinking of
translations by Zukofsky (from Plautus); from Charles Boer (Ovid). I also am
thinking of "word plays" by Kathy Acker and others.

Best,

   It was in Sagetrieb; it's called "Feminist Poetics And The Meaning of
Clarity.  It wasn't that long ago either.  It was originally a paper I did at
the ALA in San Diego in maybe '92 or 93.  It's probably in a '93 issue of
Sagetrieb.  Would you believe I'm too lazy to go look?

you might consider peter matthiessen's novel Killing Mister Watson, an

I wanted to wish hearty congratulations to those of us who are on
holiday now and probably for at least the next two weeks -- god knows
we've earned it! I myself am traveling to South Florida in a couple of
days armed only, so far, with DeLillo's _Underworld_ (finally), and
wanted to know what poets I might think of including in my bookbag
besides the obvious Crane and Stevens: any bards of that region I don't
know about, and should?

Thanks Hank: I just lookt at the Princeton entry on Verse and Prose and
it looks like lots of fun.  Should help me.  Dunno why I haven't read it
hitherto.  Or maybe it's because I came down to the verse prose problem
from poetries the Princeton pretty much ignores, particularly visual
poetry.

As for metered verse being closer to speech than prose is, that sorta
makes sense since verse would be spoken, and thus would tend to avoid
the ramble of prose that can be studied and backtracked.  Also prose
might tend to emphasize ideas and forget rhythm--indeed, not need it.
Just quick thoughts off your report.

By the way, for all you Comprepoetica-Watchers, I now have 40 bios up,
although not all are properly processed.  There's a partial one,
finally, on me, too.  I want more, though!

How many different essays turned out to be "answers" to the initial

I'm signing off till I come back to Duke around January 3.  I can be reached

For those of you going to MLA, I will be staying at the Sheraton Centre

Miekel,

People have been working on electronic paper for some time now. The goal, it
seems, would be to publish a decent lasting book as object, with many books
hidden inside as content. Press button 1 on the spine and the book is Moby
Dick, Press button 2 and it's Jimmy Carter's poems or maybe Tolstoy or
Danielle Steele, or Jay Leno's memoirs. The pages would simply reconfigure
into different words and images. But it would still have that comfy "look &
feel" of the printed word.

Bruce Sterling plays around a little with the possibilities in Holy Smoke.

A linguistics professor was lecturing to his class one day.

"In English," he said, "A double negative forms a positive. In some
languages, though, such as Russian, a double negative is still a
negative. However, there is no language wherein a double positive can
form a negative."

A voice from the back of the room piped up, "Yeah, right."

as well I would imagine that one would be able to create texts that read
differently everytime you open the book, that are intelligent & learn
what you as a reader like & dislike & evolve with the reader's
participation.  & further that each person would only need one book & if
you needed a change of pace, plug that puppy into the internet or
whatever mega storage (Xanadu?) is operable at the time & charge the
pages with fresh words/authors/languages.


now if only they could figure out how to get that letterpress feel.

the holidays are a time for wishing cheer.  and this to you is yours from me.
i live in hawaii and especially grant this forgivings to you.  i learned this
from seeing dolphins pulling santa sleigh.   and from other dolphin
sculptures, paintings, and stickers.  christian laussen is a good painter and
wyelan does happy scenes with volcanoes bursting in the background while a
dolphin jumps out of the water flippering.  underneath are electric gloe
fishes, corals and whales, mother and child.  you look as thru a glass pane
and note the artist's skill:  rendering of the border:  surface water and
underneath and air.  at the pacific beach hotel there is a three story indoor
pool where you can try out these viewing angles.  a girl scubas along with
fishes and manta rays and hammerhead shark while folks eat meals that tender
$40 a plate.  this leads to how i spent the holiday office party, which is the
christmas party here.  the company has about 30 people and so mates and
spouse-like creatures also abounded.  about 4 percent are haole like me.  we
played games after the meal.  like, how many doors are there in vanstar?  one
had to count the stalls in the wahine's room so i was at a disadvantage.
another game played i will relate to you in detail.  it's called eh, wat dis
song?  there are 20 songs so you have to guess the standard english christmas
song for the local title given:

1.  Eh you guys, try stay come.  You believe any kine, yeah?

here's the info' on the Smith book.


THINK OF THE SELF SPEAKING: Selected Interviews of Harry Smith

Introduction by Allen Ginsberg

Elbow and Cityful Press announce the first book collection of interviews
by the filmmaker, painter and archivist, Harry Smith. Over 30 years of his
life, Smith came back to the inteview as a medium for his brand of thought
and expression. These interviews reveal the genius of the man and his
contribution to arts and letters.

Harry Everett Smith was born May 29th, 1923 in Portland, Oregon. His early
childhood was spent in the Pacific Northwest- Bellingham, Anacortes,
Seattle and Portland. He attended University of Washington until before
his move to Berkeley, California in 1948. While in Berkeley he began
extensively painting and filmmaking. Smith based much of his work in the
non-objectivist style of Bauer and Kandinsky. In 1951 he received an
invitation from Hilla Rebay of the Museum of Non-Objectivist art. He also
received a Guggenheim, which allowed for him to move to New York City to
pursue film and painting.

Primarily recognized as a filmmaker, Smith's innovations in hand-painting,
collage, and batiking directly on film continue to influence on filmmakers
today. His immense 78 album collection culminated in the "Anthology of
American Music" [Re-released by Smithsonian Folkways].


Smith's range of discussion in "Think of the Self Speaking" includes:
painting, music, film, the occult, anthropology and his early childhood in
the northwest.

ISBN 1-885089-06-6. 175 pgs. 6x9, paper. $14.95 plus postage ($2.25).

Yeah, yeah.  The way I heard it, years ago, it wasn't no anonymous voice
but the voice of my old philosophy professor, Sidney Morgenbesser, scourge
of pretension (and military-industrial complexes).

Not THE Sidney Morgenbesser?

The way _I_ heard the joke, it was a three a.m. phone call from a
linguistics grad student to hir thesis adviser to say "sugar" was the only
word in English in which "su" sounded like "sh", at which the professor
said "Sure" and hung up.

What about the video *When This You See, Remember Me*?  I've shown it in
undergrad.  classes before and it provides a nice mix of biographical and
literary.  I'm not sure where one could get a copy of this.  I used the
copy at the UI library.

Hope that helps.

Julu wanders Chiyo; it's night, there are dragonnes beyond
Ears of Buddha wings, there are sighs from jinja pond
You don't go beyond.
There are dark waves, valves, not fucking Hokusai sweet Hiroshige -
What gaijin know of art can't be placed on bamboo map
Or prefecture off it, the map where - how can I write mishap
Of Julu, what she found, crashed pottery - there was blood
Between the cracks (tan dust) from three thousand or more
Years of Jericho, but this was elsewhere, temple store,
Three squares for goods. She died. There were hoods
Down the street. They thought she was meat.

        Just to defend obscure analytic philosophers for a sec:  I've heard
that comment attributed to Morgenbesser as well--he's an eminent logician,
with a rep for being quick on his feet at conferences.

 Poet Denise Levertov Dies at 74

Filed at 6:19 a.m. EST

By The Associated Press

SEATTLE (AP) -- Denise Levertov, an intense, lyrical poet whose work
evolved into free-form commentary on the social issues that were her
passion, died Saturday of complications from lymphoma. She was 74.

Influenced by William Carlos Williams and other poets of her adopted
country, Ms. Levertov addressed such political and social themes as war,
the environment and feminism.

``She was really socially committed. It was important to her to go and
protest at nuclear sites,'' said Barbara Epler, Ms. Levertov's editor since
the mid-1980s at New Directions, her longtime publisher.

``She also protested the Vietnam War. She really put her money where her
mouth was. It's like she was very 19th century with her vision of what
poetry was and how total a calling it was.''

In a 1965 essay, Ms. Levertov described her poetry as aspiring toward
``organic form.''

``In organic poetry the metric movement, the measure, is the direct
expression of the movement of perception,'' she wrote.

The idea, said Fran Polek, professor emeritus at Gonzaga University in
Spokane, Wash., is to have the form arise ``naturally from the particular
topic or the particular approach, just as plant or flower grows in a
particular way in certain soils.''

``Her poetry looks in a mystical way for inner reality, inner truth,''
Polek said. ``She might start with a mundane-sounding topic, but she's
always trying to find some mystical basis for reality. I think this is her
charm, really.''

Ms. Levertov published more than 20 volumes of poetry since 1946, the most
recent being ``Sands of the Well'' in 1996.

She won such awards as the Shelley Memorial Award, the Robert Frost Medal,
the Lenore Marshall Prize and the Lannan Award, along with a Guggenheim
Fellowship and a National Institute of Arts and Letters grant.

Ms. Levertov was born in England and was educated largely at home. During
World War II, she worked as a nurse and later married an American soldier,
Mitchell Goodman, who became a politically active writer and teacher.

They moved to the United States in 1948 and Ms. Levertov became a U.S.
citizen in 1955. She and Goodman had a son named Nikolai before they
divorced in 1974. Goodman died earlier this year.

Ms. Levertov, who taught at Stanford University from 1981 to 1994, moved to
Seattle in 1989.


****

from The New York Times

December 23, 1997


          Denise Levertov, 74, Poet and Activist


          By MEL GUSSOW

               Denise Levertov, a poet of intense emotion and fervid
political conviction, died on Saturday at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle,
where she lived. She was 74.

The cause was complications from lymphoma, said Griselda Ohannessian of New
Directions, Ms. Levertov's publisher.

As a poet and political activist, Ms. Levertov was "a touchstone, a
maintainer for our generation," the poet Robert Creeley, one of her first
publishers in the United States, said Monday. "She was a constantly
defining presence in the world we shared, a remarkable and transforming
poet for all of us. She always had a vivid emotional response and also a
completely dedicated sense of political and social need."

The poet Kenneth Rexroth once wrote that Ms. Levertov was "the most subtly
skillful poet of her generation, the most profound, the most modest, the
most moving."

In the tradition established by William Carlos Williams, she wrote with a
concrete immediacy of language. She spoke directly through her poetry,
favoring commonplace objects and images over large philosophical concepts.

The author of more than 30 books of poetry, essays and translations, she
wrote with great particularity and sensitivity about aspects of love,
spiritual as well as erotic. More and more, her work conveyed her political
awareness and social consciousness. She was, as in the title of her first
book of essays, "The Poet in the World."

At the same time, in her art she would contemplate her own life, writing
confessional poems about her marital and familial problems. For her,
content and form were "in a dynamic state of interaction."

In "The Ache of Marriage," she wrote:

"The ache of marriage:

thigh and tongue, beloved,

are heavy with it,

it throbs in the teeth

We look for communion

and are turned away, beloved,

each and each

It is leviathan and we

in its belly

looking for joy, some joy

not to be known outside it

two by two in the ark of

the ache of it."

And in "Of Being," she wrote:

"I know this happiness

is provisional:

the looming presences --

great suffering, great fear --

withdraw only

into peripheral vision:

but ineluctable this shimmering

of wind in the blue leaves:

this flood of stillness

widening the lake of sky:

this need to dance,

this need to kneel:

this mystery:"

A defining moment of her life was the Vietnam War. She helped found a group
called the Writers' and Artists' Protest Against the War in Vietnam, she
was actively involved in the anti-nuclear movement and in 1967 she edited a
volume of poetry for the War Resisters League. In the same year, she
published "The Sorrow Dance," a book of poems whose sorrow included the war
and also the death of the poet's sister.

Ms. Levertov was born in Ilford, England. Her father was Paul Philip
Levertoff, a Russian Jew who converted to Christianity and became an
Anglican priest. Her mother was from Wales.

Her father's conversations about the family background in Hasidism and her
mother's knowledge of Welsh and English folklore proved influential.
Educated by her parents, she was introduced to poetry by her older sister,
Olga, and was writing from an early age.

During World War II, she worked as a nurse in London and also began
publishing her poetry. In 1940 her first poem appeared in Poetry Quarterly,
and, said Rexroth, he and other poets were soon "in excited correspondence
about her" as "the baby of the new Romanticism." Her first volume of verse,
"The Double Image," was published in 1946.

After the war she married Mitchell Goodman, an American writer, and for
several years they lived in France near Creeley, who was a friend of
Goodman. In 1948 the couple moved to the United States, where Ms. Levertov
studied and was influenced by such modernist poets as Williams, Wallace
Stevens and Ezra Pound, and also continued her artistic relationship with
Creeley, Robert Duncan and other Black Mountain poets.

Both she and her husband frequently spoke out on political issues,
particularly regarding the Vietnam War. Goodman was convicted along with
Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling resistance of the draft. Ms. Levertov and
Goodman were divorced in 1975. Goodman died last February. They had one
son, Nikolai, who lives in Seattle.

When Ms. Levertov's 11th collection of verse, "The Freeing of the Dust,"
was published in 1975, the poet David Ignatow wrote in The New York Times
Book Review that "by nearly unanimous agreement Levertov was well on her
way to becoming one of our leading poets" with "her forceful and
compassionate presentations of urban lives" and "the beauty and
sensuousness of her nature poems." By shifting to "passionate Vietnam
poems," she had lost some of her following but gained a new vitality.

Ms. Levertov wrote through six decades. In the 1990s, she published "New
and Selected Essays"; four poetry volumes, "Evening Train," "Sands of the
Well," "The Life Around Us: Selected Poems on Nature" and "The Stream and
The Sapphire: Selected Poems on Religious Themes," and the prose memoir
"Tesserae: Memories and Suppositions."

She taught at colleges and universities, and served as poetry editor of The
Nation and Mother Jones. Among her honors were the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award
in poetry and the $50,000 Lannan Prize. In 1996, she won the Governor's
Award from the Washington state Commission for the Humanities.

She felt compelled to clarify and justify the uses of poetry in a world of
political crisis. In "New and Selected Essays" she wrote, "One is in
despair over the current manifestation of malevolent imbecility and the
seemingly invincible power of rapacity, yet finds oneself writing a poem
about the trout lilies in the spring woods. And one has promised to speak
at a meeting or help picket a building. If one is conscientious, the only
solution is to attempt to weigh conflicting claims at each crucial moment,
and in general to try to juggle well and keep all the oranges dancing in
the air at once."

Ms. Levertov was a masterly juggler of words, images and feelings, as well
as a defender of artistic and political liberty.

In "Overheard Over S.E. Asia," she wrote:

"I am the snow that burns.

I fall

wherever men send me to fall --

but I prefer flesh, so smooth, so dense:

I decorate it in black, and seek the bone."

"Effacement"

Today the mountain
is cloud,
pale cone of shadow
veiled by a paler scrim ---

majestic presence become
one cloud among others,
humble vapor,
barely discernible,

like the archangel walking
with Tobias on dusty roads.

Settling

I was welcomed here--clear gold
of late summer, of opening autumn,
the dawn eagle sunning himself on the highest tree,
the mountain revealing herself unclouded, her snow
tinted apricot as she looked west,
tolerant, in her steadfastness, of the restless sun
forever rising and setting.
                            Now I am given
a taste of the grey foretold by all and sundry,
a grey both heavy and chill.  I've boasted I would not care,
I'm London-born.  And I won't.  I'll dig in,
into my days, having come here to live, not to visit.
Grey is the price
of neighboring with eagles, of knowing
a mountain's vast presence, seen or unseen.

        HYPOCRITE WOMEN

Hypocrite women, how seldom we speak
of our own doubts, while dubiously
we mother man in his doubt!

And if at Mill Valley perched in the trees
the sweet rain drifting through western air
a white sweating bull of a poet told us

our cunts are ugly--why didn't we
admit we have thought so too? (And
what shame? They are not for the eye!)

No, they are dark and wrinkled and hairy,
caves of the Moon. . .   And when a
dark humming fills us, a

coldness towards life,
we are too much women to
own to such unwomanliness.

Whorishly with the psychopomp
we play and plead--and say
nothing of this later.       And our dreams,

with what frivolity we have pared them
like toenails, clipped them like ends of
split hair.


+++++++++++++++

This took considerable courage to write/publish in the early 60s.

The local details & name are curiously irrelevant, one thinks. It was
coding, along with the "white sweating bull of a poet," to identify Jack
Spicer as the speaker of the cunts-are-ugly line.

"They are not for the eye!" resonates oddly after 35 years of feminist
debate.But the impetus to begin such debate must be attributed in part to
Denise Levertov's prompting. She was frank, and she was given to assertion.


The Vietnam War was tragic for countless persons, Denise among them. Being
in the right is not good for a poet. Surely, though, she helped bring that
war to its close.

She told me--this was in 1972 or so when I visited her in Boston--I can
hear still the earnestness of her tone, she had found the truth and she was
feeling its indignity--that she had been "used" by the Black Mountaineers
as "their token woman." No doubt (no doubt that is what she felt), but I
and many others were so glad that this abuse had resulted in her poetry
being available to us, and I said so. Certainly the exposure that was one
result, her work in the Allen anthology, brought her poetry to a far wider
audience than she could, at the outset, have rustled up all on her own. But
she would not concern herself with that qualification.

I experienced her generosity,love, enthusiasm, intensity, intelligence and
rectitude firsthand the year I was her TA at Berkeley, and a short time
thereafter. Mitch and she opened their home to me among so many others who
could be supposed to embrace their causes. I loved her. She was endearingly
gat-toothed, like John Ashbery (and likely the Wife of Bath). She could
also get very giggly, English-schoolgirl giggly. Her innocence was always
with her, and seldom prissy.

But there was more than a touch of "party-line" about her taste. She did
not read younger poets with the catholicism she herself, as one who had
overturned the money-lenders' tables in the temple, might more
perspicaciously have striven to maintain. Or so I felt. Rae Armantrout, a
student of hers, however, has testified to the encouragement she received.
And surely Rae's work is radically different from Denise's; although in
"Merrit Parkway," for instance, I find echoes, and a possible precedence
for Rae's more subtle nailings of american life : "speeding with/ a slurred
sound". . . .

It was at the MLA in San Diego two, three years since that I went to a
Levertov reading for the last time. It was very well-attended, in a room
that was a little too large (compared to the smaller, densely-packed room
where Sharon Olds was reading at the same time). I cannot recall the poems
she read with any vividness. The mode was by now as familiar as it had been
extraordinary, 30 years before. Possibly I was speeding with a slurred
sound.

Not death but time is the evil, time with its repetitions and
forgetfulness. I recall mostly the gracious, nuanced voice, so like my
sister's (just her age), the persistence, the curiosity, the sense that
each life had value, as though Auschwitz might just be atoned for. if from
her example each could draw strength and veneration for life, in its
specificities. Yet how well she knew the dulling of habit, of the familiar
: "The Ache of Marriage" cannot be bettered, :"two by two in the ark of/the
ache of it."

I mourn the Denise I knew, here in the fag-end of this year that brought
death to many of our poets. Reading through her books, I come across these
lines(from "The Five-Day Rain") :

Wear scarlet!  Tear the green lemons
off the tree!  I don't want
to forget who I am, and what has burned in me,
and hang limp and clean, an empty dress--



    That is the feeling, and she wrote it. David

Denise was a terrific poet. In fact I just set an exam for freshmen, with
her poem "The Hands" as a sight reading. If there is ever a poem that makes
freshies think and respond with imagination, it is that one.

To think: I once tramped all the way to her place in a nowhere town at the
end of a road in mid-Maine, but never went 200km down the I-5 to see her in
Seattle! We have to quit expecting our heroes to be around for ever.

It's far from a stupid question; I can't answer it; but I remember a

there are support programs in the microsoft SDK which I think you'd need to
get before you could successful tweak your browser

I hate to say this but it is probably worth searching at the microsoft

> nico vassilakis had asked about films with/of gertrude stein:

this is a bit of a scrap, but I've a vague idea that Gertrude Stein
makes at least a bit of a cameo appearance in the film *The Moderns*
(which I think appeared in U.S. theatres upward of a decade ago).
Ernest Hemingway I recall more clearly -- there was the (presumed)
conceit of having him converse in his trademark clipped-prose style.
Certainly not a film about (let alone of) Stein, just noting that, in
fictional form, maybe she makes a cameo there (??) --

d.i.

p.s.: btw, speaking of Stein, can any of our NYers perhaps confirm as
to whether the bi-annual marathon reading from her *Making of
Americans* (or it is Making of An American?) continues to take place
at a SoHo gallery (circa New Years eve)?

I've not yet explored it, but the Cathay.Net site ("Read Chinese in
Net Applications") looks perhaps promising --
http://WWW.Cathay.Net/help/read-chn.shtml
(this page is for Windows, but they also have links for Mac etc.)

Further, you might find it worthwhile to check out my old Berkeley
artist/musician-friend Dajuin Yao's SinoLogic site --
http://www.sinologic.com/

His links page leads in many directions.  And the Chinese visual
poetry experiments might also prove of some interest to folks here.

The "Chinese Learner's Alternative Page"
http://www.sinologic.com/clap.html   is self-described thus:
<<     C L A P offers you supplementary learning material
         on Chinese language and
         original articles on the latest directions in Chinese
         language and Chinese culture.

         This page is not only a free support for and service to the
         users of HyperChina, but also an electronic magazine for
         everyone who is studying or interested in Chinese language
         and Chinese culture.

Getting more directly on-point --
<< The editors of this magazine have just launched yet another Web site
         to diverge their creative output. Called "Wonderfully Absurd
         Temple (WAT?)," or MIAO MIAO MIAO in Chinese, this strangely
         beautiful and seriously humorous site is an one-of-a-kind Web
         gallery featuring Chinese avant-garde Web art/concrete
         poetry/virtual music/experimental Buddhist art/virtual
         performance art/multimedia and no-media conceptual art.

         Since the content is mostly in graphics format, you can check
         it out even without a Chinese decoding system. There is also
         an English version. Enjoy!  >>

Direct link to miao-miao-miao is:
http://www.sinologic.com/webart/

Since (for one thing) I don't presently have "a Chinese decoding
system," hitting the "English" button (which appears after a small
sequence of intro pages) proved expedient.

To cite one example from what's to be found there,
http://www.sinologic.com/webart/shi/shie.html
"Auto-Exoticism 1" is a time-art visual work described thus:

                                  by Sounding Gourd
             Notes:

              This work shows a series of Chinese characters
              "morphing" into the next one, which shares a common
              element in the ideogram as the previous one, while the
              shared element keeps changing everytime.

              The author purposefully had the ideograms so enlarged
              and sometimes abstracted to pure geometric shapes (with
              the help of this particular sans serif font) that it is
              often impossible to read/recognize the characters (and
              decode its meaning) even for the Chinese viewer,
              especially when the parts of ideograms are gradually
              substituted and thus often stripped of its semantic
              associations. The characters are carefully chosen and
              arranged so that this "morphing" transformation forms an
              endless loop.   . . . >>

/ / / / /

Also, -- looking now at anouther www source -- this page --
http://www.ocrat.com/ocrat/voa/gpin16.html
has a some worthwhile links --

(it's from the "Study Chinese Mandarin Using VOA" site (which,
incidentally, uses Voice of America newscasts, quick-loading GIF
files for the [so to say] kanji text (except that it's in "simplified
characters" -- the PRC standard form of characters, which often
differ from the old-style chinese/japanese), and RealAudio, to give a
multimedia study approach to the VOA's news of moment)

Miekal, if you might at some point kindly post a few interesting URLs
from "the Japanese visual poetry & hypermedia scene," that'd be good.

Thanks especially to David Bromige for his account of Denise
Levertov.  I did not know of Denise's connection to Bromige nor to
Rae Armantrout.  Denise's earlier work meant a great deal to me, was
crucial to my own development of an ability to hear poetry.  When Bob
Hass lived for a year in Charlottesville, he would read aloud a range
of poetry to illustrate the beauty of certain sounds.  I recall Bob
reading work by Creeley, John Logan, and Levertov.  I read and re-
read and said Denise's early work, particularly poems from The
Jacob's Ladder and The Sorrow Dance.  When I organized the What Is a
Poet? conference (1984), Denise was one of the participants.  She was
in some pain (due to a nerve disease), and she was quite difficult
to work with.  The event itself was quite contentious, especially the
free-for-all of the concluding panel discussion, in which Denise
accused Charles Bernstein (and all language poets) of polluting the
public beach of language.  And at that time, Denise had also been
engaged in a letter-writing campaign to deny Marjorie Perloff a
teaching position at Stanford.  My correspondence and my working
relationship with Denise for those couple of years were rather
strained.  This week, I am (instructed and) struck by the great
generosity of Bromige's remembrance of Denise.  Personally, I retain
many elements of that ear training which I associate with Denise's
poetry--a certainy delicacy, beauty, and modulation of vowel sounds
particularly.  And am tempted to say "what thou lovest well
remains...."  Which in my case is a love of certain sounds in poetry,
a certain lyricism, which remains linked to Denise's poetry, which
nonetheless is also linked to the complicated, heated politics of
poetry business too.

Thanks, Hank Lazer, for the interesting post on this quiet day.  Without
any wish to dabble in the poetry politics, I want to second what you said
about that elusive sound-lyric element of poetry.  It seems to inhabit
a region between sound and meaning, speech & music.
Croce once wrote somewhere that "pure poetry",
contra the Symbolists, was not pure sound - not a strictly abstract
aesthetic effect.  "Poesie pure", pure poetry, for Croce, meant a
balance between sound and meaning.  The kind of free verse practiced by
Levertov, and so many others in the 60s & 70s, seems to have aimed
by very simple & direct means for what Croce defines; and maybe the means
began to seem too direct, after a while - too easily imitable, too much
the same thing.  The vein was mined for all it was worth.  (?)

Maybe the sound-lyric quality has something to do with the "lost art"
of prosody (as defined in the ILS Dictionary of Received Ideas,
a hallowed volume placed right next to my well-thumbed Glinkenschneider's
_Geschichte der Philologische Banana-shchplittzeinestrabismus_ and
Vittorio di Paolabologna's _Historia della Sprezzatura di Spaghetti_).
Lost somewhere between the Established P*o*e*t*s, the Experimentalists,
and the Nude Formalists.  Lost somewhere... hey, there it is!  PROSODY!
Whaddya know-- right where I left it, under the avocado plant near the
back door next to the shovel and the plastic toy motorcycle!  PROSODY!
Hey!  Get back here, you're part of POETRY!  Hey!  Dagnab it, there he
goes, out the door -- here, Prosody...

Apologies for the double message on Denise Levertov, but I received a very
convoluted message telling me that mine had NOT reached Tony Lopez (Hi
Tony) in Plymouth England, & that seems to mean that it had not reached
Poetics either. Then I was off yesterday, & found the 2nd message had not
reached Tony either. Of course in neither case had I tried to reach him,
since all I did was use the Reply function. Am still a babe in the woods
with this technology...

It'll be interesting to see if this one doesn't reach him either...

Poetas,

might interest y'all -- lately has come to my attn that Performance
Space 122, veteran alternative / in-vogue East Village home (your
mileage may vary, but the alliteration will out) has ventured into
cyberspace:
The Ps122 Gallery Online address is:
http://www.users.interport.net/~ps122gal/

and included is artwURL:
http://www.users.interport.net/~ps122gal/artwurl/index.html
conceived as an online periodical (zine), including newsish
NYC/art-world-reportage.

There are some online projects -- both visual & sound -- featuring
artists-in-virtual residence.

For the past half-hour or something, I've been downloading a
Shockwave file / sound project (interestingly described anyway), the
creation of a certain Larry 7 -- the site's first invited sound artist:

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I've been working on a book concerned with writing, philosophy,
virtuality, etc., for the past two weeks. It summarizes a lot of my
theoretical writing, using a path or meander. You may find it at:

http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html
or  http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt  .

Please check it out. The introduction follows below.]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------



                         The Beginning of the Book




Introduction to The Beginning of the Book


If there were an introduction to the beginning of the book (which has
just reached a natural conclusion, or ending, in relation to its pro-
duction "at the other end of things," this might function as such,
that is announcing its conclusion (one always wonders when prefaces,
introductions, forwards, are produced in relation to the rest of the
text) -

What appears to be a book about words is a book about the spaces be-
tween them, where the work of ontology and epistemology is done. So
it's about the doing or constituting between states, interstitially
within both digital and analog domains. Where there is a loosening of
construct on one hand, and a "jostling" on the other.

What appears to be awash in philosophy is, in fact, naive through an
almost hysteric affection, bordering on care. I realized from the
first that I didn't know what I was talking about (was ignorant of the
subject) - much less what I was writing about (was ignorant of the
name of the subject).

Think of a book inflicted on its author, or of a book writing its
author. Or think of a book constituting the origin of writing, each
ideogram suddenly hardening the germ of a new idea. I write this with-
out map or territory, in the midst of foreign _kanji,_ and I cannot
read the world around me.

Without reading, I begin to be born into the realm of content, land-
scape features, subtle distinctions in topography, the lay of a world
in which "natural" and "artificial" dissolve in the presence of unin-
terpretable signs.

This is the realm of content which undermines languages, the insuffer-
able disturbance of an imaginary which cannot be named.

When I began The Beginning of the Book, I did not realize it would be
a book, much less a Beginning, so much as a text; these texts, then,
all twenty of them concatenated, form a linked chain flooding from one
torus to another, the metal spaced by air. It's the air, cleaved
around the chain, that I write - hoping for a discourse in which some-
thing other than discourse might emerge. Call this emergence a form of
"wryting," and read on.

I think that's true - I don't think Tony has become non-functional though,
just a glitch or unfinished housekeeping at his university - i espoke with
him recently and he seemed fairly functional

On facing pages of the December 19 1997 TLS: a review of Laura Riding &
Schuyler Jackson's _Rational Meaning_; the announcement that David Lehman
won the week's "Author, Author" competition by correctly identifying the
authors of the following three passages:

1. So much for self-analysis. Now,
about what to put in your poem-painting:
Flowers are always nice, particularly delphinium.
Names of boys you once knew and their sleds,
Skyrockets are good -- do they still exist?
There are a lot of other things of the same quality
As those I've mentioned.

2. I think I would rather be
A painter, but I am not. Well,

For instance, Mike Goldberg
is starting a painting. I drop in.
"Sit down and have a drink" he
says. I drink; we drink. I look
up. "You have SARDINES in it."
"Yes, it needed something there."

3. I often think _Play_ was my best work.
It is an open field with a few boards in it.

Children are allowed to come and play in _Play_
By persmission of the Cleveland Museum.
I look up at the white clouds, I wonder what I shall do, and smile.

Perhaps someone will grow up having been influenced by _Play_,
I think -- but what good will that do?
Meanwhile I am interested in steel cigarettes.

__
It was amusing enough a month or so ago when John Ashbery correctly
identified W. H. Auden, Elizabeth Bishop, and I think Hart Crane, but
really, _ca suffit_! Not that I'm looking at this as a sort of Sputnik
crisis (how difficult was it, really, to put a beeping grapefruit into
orbit). Rod Smith, you used to quiz the list from time to time, won't you
test us again? In the meantimes, I will send a tiny xmas present to
the first lister to email me with the correct responses (no fair rushing
to the newsstand) with their street address. All right, on your marks.

With love from Paris in August,
Jordan

The Future of Narrative:
Speculative Criticism

Deadline: September 1, 1998

Guest Editor:
Lance Olsen, University of Idaho
lolsen@uidaho.edu

It is the nature of traditional criticism to keep a firm eye on the
rearview mirror, rediscovering, reevaluating, and renegotiating texts
that have cruised the narratological autobahn for years, decades, even
centuries. At their most adventurous, critical works will sometimes
hazard a brief glance out the side windows for a quick contemplation of
their immediate surroundings. This special issue of _Paradoxa_, however,
due to appear in the summer of 1999, invites submissions that turn their
attention forward to consider what narrative will look like, sound like,
and read like in the new millennium.

Some areas of investigation might include, though should in no way be
limited to: How will the continuing postmodern dissolution of
boundaries--between, say, prose and poetry, "creative" writing and
"critical," genre and genre, page and screen, "high" culture and "low,"
"literature" and "paraliterature," atomic-based formats and digital,
geopolitical country and more fluid electronic constellations--affect
that trajectory? How will the advent of such relatively new multimedia
as hypertext, CD-Rom, and the World Wide Web contribute to the always
mutating shape and concerns of narrative? Which young creators or groups
of young creators will be worth keeping a critical eye on? Which
now-established creators or groups of creators will or should fall from
visibility, and how might this influence the notion of canon
reconfiguration? What changes can we expect with regard to ideas of
authorship, writing, language, originality, the growing global
technocracy, the marketplace, publishing outlets, even how we have come
to conceptualize art itself? In a phrase: where in the world (and out of
it) is narrative going, and why?

We will consider both conventional offerings and those that themselves
cross generic or discursive boundaries, thereby critifictionally
enacting the mutations they are discussing, but all pieces (6,500 words
maximum) should be lucid, jargon-free, and accessible to a literate
general audience. Style must conform to the _MLA Handbook for Writers of
Research Papers_, 4th ed. (1995).

Myself, while tooling down the literary autobahn (are there autobahns in
Idaho? Does this have to do with the Aryan Nation?), I'm usually keeping an
eye peeled for the next rest-stop: need to get rid of the burden of some of
the old narrative ingested in previous food plazas, and need to fuel up for
the future with the latest pizza: was it Horace or Ashberry who said that a
poem should be like a pizza?
But I digress. While I'm driving I tend to face forwards, and to hell with
the rearview mirror: there's no speedlimit on the autobahn. And the fun of
driving, anyway, is that what's coming up has no discoverable narrative
structure until you drive through it.
Although I guess, if there's science fiction, there might as well be
critical fiction. Think of it. Valleys in hidden corners filled with Lost
Departments, where books are printed by exposing slices of bread to flame,
the letters produced by overlaying each slice with a foil stencil. The
reader creates the text by adding the lunch meats and oleos of his or her
choice and calls it a sandwich. In such a department there would be no
eyestrain but lots of gas.
Actually, this mine has been somewhat exploited before by Freud and others,
who invented the psychoanalysis of the dead, but that looked to a
fictionalized past. What's proposed here is a bolder step--the critique of
the not-yet-composed. An idea with legs--there could be schools without
libraries, academics without briefcases, and courses with no syllabus
whatsoever.

AFTER ME CAME THE DELUGE

A Portable Novel
by Jack Spandrift

Chapter 1-Zeugma

It was a stark and dormitory night once, upon a time.  I was driven west-
southwest at an angle of 38 degrees centigrade by a twister named Meg,
moving along at a studied canter on my trusty horse whose name was X____
and will remain so - ambiguous by name and a nag by fame, don't email me
about this or try to research the background, it's already been covered
by Beauregard Pinkneed in his phd. enturtled "The future is our
suture : the decline of text in an era of --xt" [Univ. of Left Overbie,
2003 and counting].

The  wind blew
heavy, on the border-
line...

As we rode along I muttered these lines of an ancient Nordic folksong
known as the slysh-nannachocht or "traveler's catch to be sung while
being driven west".  Suddenly an immense shadow lifted heavy dark
bat-like fangs [sic. wings? - ed.] behind me.  In a flash of
serene multiplexist reflection, I realized it was the Giant of
Myself, Jack "Chuck Olson" Spandrift, caught in a blinding evening
downdraft of horizontal sunlight....

Chapter 2-plug-in

[only available in version 7-b. sorry, suckers]

Chapter 3 - blurb

"Spandrift has done it again. What can I say?  Sheesh!"  - Helen Vendler

Chapter 4- conclusion

Dear, dear, dear, oh dear Reader: as you know, "narrrrrrrrr [damn keyboard]
rrrrrrrrrativve in the next Milllll {sorry!!!} llllennn  N eeee!!! um...
will BE.  I mean it will be written in here-or-theroglyphs using
Microhard dweeb-disk scratchpads and massage-rollers.  It will tell
"real stories", though.

Hello, everybody!  Here I am, comfortably esconced in my cozy den at home
in East Wuzzlemount, cloistered under a plume of fine pipe-tabac, and
mildly roistered by a goodly dram of Old Gen-ringa-ding-ding-denning,
"checking" my "email", as you Yanks so tersely, or concisely I should
say, have it (over hereabouts we call it Electronical (or Electro-Tammy
or Electro-Tommy, as you wish, for short) Correspondence) - when to my
surprise I find an electronical version of an early Spandrift novel!
Gad!  Well, promptly did I not pull down my First Firksimilio-Folio
Edition of the Werken Iacobus Spandriftischen (translegrotten into
the Auld Hi! Dutch) and check for myself - and what in heaven's name
did I find?  Well.  You will note the [sic] [[error]] editorial mark
after the conclusio above ["THE ED [sic]"]; yet in the First
FirsimilioFolio Edition, this line is quite, quite ambiguous!
There is a blurring of the ink, perhaps an erasure, after the "c"
in "sic" - which looks very much to this old Brit's eye like
none other than a question mark!  My Sherlockian critical intellect
"kicked in", as you Yanks will have it - and I came to the following
conclusio about this conclusio:  the original Firksian editor assumed
Spandrift meant to write (or dictate) the word "END".  But the editor
nevertheless felt a slight, almost intangible TWINGE of doubt -
perhaps - is it possible? - the "ED" is absolutely non contra
auctoritamus! - and ALLUDES in a diagrammatic hockey puck left pass
maneuver to the "X____" "nag" of Chapter 1-Zeugma!!  In other words -
to put it baldly - THE ED is....   MR. ED!   Hence the "scream"
of "EDvard" Munchvian recognition in Chapter 4! (& if one begins to
sense the subtextual thread leading from MR. Ed to the ED-itor
himself... Gad!)

I will try a bit of Yanqui concision myself - and leave the rest
for "list" perusal, inquiry, investigation, evaluation, grading,
damning, praising, hailing, well-metting, cheese-offing, and so forth.

Is that idiot Blarnes suggesting that narrative in the next millenium will
be written by HORSES????

Jeez, get a life, Blarnes.  Or lay off the scotch, "old chappie".  This
thread is getting really knotty and I can barely tie my shoes anymore.
If there's a story there, you're welcome to it.  & here's a penny for
the old guy, Merry Christmas.

In my humble opinion (or IMUHGRMHO, as some will have it), narrative in the
next eggnog will be too long a word for everybody.  It'll be called
NA (pronounced like "neigh").  And poetry will be PO (pronounced like
"poe" in tram-poe-line).  Then there will be combos like NA-PO and
PO-NA with a little NA-CRI-PO or CRI-NA-PO thrown in for good measure.
(Not to mention NA-PO-RE or narrative verse recipes).

As I say, Blarnes, get a life.  I got mine at 30 percent off at Job Lot
yesterday, they might still have some.  And leave the List to really
interesting threads, like 4-Wheel Zoot or All-Weather Vehicle Treadboots.
But hey, merry whatever, bud.  - Henry Gould

i read in the paper that sally marr (nee, i think, kitchenstein, if memory
serves), the 91 year old mother of lenny bruce, died in l.a.  they were
very close.  i feel sad cuz, although i had her phone # i was too timid to
ever use it. i mean, what would i have said.  that's not the main reason i
feel sad tho.  i feel sad cuz she was someone who was close to, and
formative of, someone i find fascinating.--md

Is it not a perfect illustration that a paper on "the future of narrative"

Is it just that everyone out there has a life (horrid thought..)

Or has the List shut down in some catastrophic way (or was it all just a
dream?)?  Or is it all just a technical problem on my end (which is like a
dream, only more complicated)?

Believe it or not, even Eric Blarnes, the pseudo-anglo-indo-acado-
bambi-doe prof from E. Wuzzlemount, went & got a life.  I saw him
this afternoon right here in widget-size Providence,
reading "The Charge of the Light Brigade" at the top of his lungs
from the back of a fire truck, complete with sax accompaniment
and backup vocalists.  I threw him a penny, too. (Change from
the discount life I picked up for MYSELF down at Job Lot.)

ODE TO THE NEW YEAR
by Eric Blarnes, O.E.D.ph.-4

The sprinkles that fall from turbidulous clouds
like manna from Mammon's big Mama Louise,
are each of them every one special, though crowds
of them gather in drifts to my knees
& soon I must shovel them off the sidewalk
or face a crude fine from our Mayor, Cianci,
who sells his own pasta sauce here 'round the clock -
which reminds me - jolly old stuffy Sir Blarnesee -
get your boots on, my lad, and toddle downtown,
it's the New Year's Parade, & you're playing the Clown!
- Jolly good of you, Spandrift, to jostle my Braincell!
Thanks much, old chap, hope your New Year is - is - swell!
(- okay boys, desist with the self-conversation -
time to chime now as one, O you Schizo-Creation)
"Cannon to the right of them, cannon to the left of them,
volleyed and thundered..."  [oh, topping!  splendid!]

Sounds lonely, Mark - but it's just as lonely here in Boulder. Like
those post-apocalypse movies where stranded islets of humanity cluster
around their ham radios, sounding their pathetic refrain, Hello is
anyone out there? amid long stretches of unnerving static.

But since you posted, I'll ask - has the newest ish of Misc. Proj. gone
out yet?

And a more general query for Ron Silliman or anyone else: in which book
of Ron's can I find the poem based on the Fibonacci series? Is it called
"Fibonacci Series"? Or something else? You see, my mother handwove me a
rayon chenille opera-length scarf this Xmas and the thread pattern is
based on the Fibonacci series. It's quite the most beautiful thing, both
to look at and wear. I shall wear it out tonight, ignorant of its
intricacy, yet delighting in it all the same.

Calling all stations, but not expecting an answer -

Silliman's _Tjanting_ uses the Fibonacci series. I got wrapped up in it
scarf-like two years ago.

In the future, the narrative will have characters and deal with a
generally continuous period of time. If people read it, it will be
considered hack work, if they don't it will be considered art.
