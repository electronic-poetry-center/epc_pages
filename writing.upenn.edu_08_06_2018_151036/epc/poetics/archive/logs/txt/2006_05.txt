The article is about the loss of faith by one man, not about "balance"
- note that they did talk to some other scholars who came away with
other answers using, they say, the same methods, although I have my
doubts about this sameness. I know this question will hit a stone wall
- but why deny Bart Ehrman his story? Doubtless, if the story went the
other way, "balance" would not be called for.

My interpretation of Bart Ehrmans story is that he applied Reason to
an artefact foundational to his beliefs. Once you let Reason in, it is
hard to stop and he came away with not totally unexpected results.
Treated forensically, the christian bible is a body of text layered,
patched, mis-translated, mis-shapen, an historical document containing
myths and distortions, with ideology striping it's core like a stick
of blackpool rock.  Treated with enough faith to paste over the
cracks, it becomes something else. But then, mutatis mutandi, so does
The Lord Of The Rings.

But hey, I could go on all day like this and I'm not about to do that.

  All,

  After consultations, we have reconfigured the wherewecreate project.

  The new and easy on you guidelines are listed below. The project needs
  content to get started so please send soon.


  Where We Create Project.    http://newformsreview.com/wherewecreate/

  The first project from the newly built newformsreview.com founded by Jason Nelson,
  a net art and digital Literature portal and forthcoming peer-reviewed journal.

  The Where We Create Project is designed to connect digital artists and writers (and
  analog creators  as well) through a website featuring photos and descriptions of where
  artists/writers create. Our geographies and external landscapes are instrumental
   in altering and forming the creatures we create.

  What we need is the following sent to this address:   wherewecreate@gmail.com

  1. An image or two, 300 px by 300 px jpg or around there, of where you create.
This can be your office, your backyard, some coffee shop, whatever you want
to show the physical space(s) where you work.

  2. Some text about that place and its meaning to you, your work, your life,
  or whatever you feel represents the world in which you create. We are looking
  for around five or six or seven sentences, but not much more.

  3. Your name, any other brief biographical information, and where this places
  you are talking about are: for example:  Emporia, Kansas, downtown
  office building, second floor in the back….

  4. and a few urls so people can go see the work you create in that place.

  NOTE: Please keep in mind the more personal space the better, and
  that this isn't intended to showcase your artistic skills,
  but rather share a small bit of your geography.

  Cheers, Jason Nelson

One of the incalculably valuable things about literature is that it often
challenges our judgement, shows us deep into the motivations of people and
deep into their points of view. One of the results is sometimes that we are
less quick to judge others. If the word of God is (and is of) love, justice,
truth, beauty, and understanding, we come to see that it is not written by
God Almighty in holy books, but by people, and that the divine, the ideal,
and the quotidian are in mysterious but dynamic relation and do indeed
require some faith, but not faith that ideals are easily found if only we
hold to a literalist's naivety that God writes as people do. We ourselves
write the word of God in our determination to discover and create justice,
beauty and truth in our lives.

Even if things like justice and straight lines and points with no length or
width are imaginary, they are ideals that we need in our efforts to be fair
and builders of what is possible, explorers of what is fair and what is
possible.

Joanne Kyger reading & celebration

Every year the board of directors of Small Press Traffic Literary Arts
Center votes a Lifetime Achievement Award to a living writer of distinction.
Past honorees have included Barbara Guest, Jackson Mac Low, and Carl Rakosi.
The latest recipient of SPT's Lifetime Achievement Award is Joanne Kyger.

Joanne Kyger made an auspicious debut as the golden girl of the
Spicer-Duncan circle of the late 1950s in San Francisco. Within a month of
her arrival everyone wanted a piece of Kyger, and she became associated with
many of the fluid, mercurial poetry scenes around the "New American Poetry."
Like her best writing, she was everywhere at once, deep inside the Beat
movement, all over Japan and India, up and down the San Francisco
Renaissance, steeped in Charles Olson's polis-based soul curriculum, our
ambassador to the New York scenes of Ted Berrigan and Anne Waldman, the
mainstay of Bolinas, and a seer in the Buddhist poetics of the Jack Kerouac
School at Naropa University in Boulder. Those are only the locations; deeper
underneath, the substance of her many lives created, over forty-five years,
a new poetic freedom. Based on frank and sensual observation, an innovating
line, a sometimes acerbic wit, and a devotion to the 'golden root' of
compassion, Kyger's poetry continues to win her the admiration of numerous
generations.

Joining us for Kyger's reading will be her friend, the poet Michael
Rothenberg, who edited As Ever, Kyger's selected poems, for Penguin Books in
2002. Rothenberg, author of Unhurried Vision, has recently relocated to the
Russian River area and will be on hand to introduce her. We will also show
Kyger's 1968 video, "Descartes."

Thank you for saying so, Peter,
but I have a correction:
In all the years of the BC Book Awards
in all the categories of book
I have never won a BC Book Award.

I hope many here got outside today. Here in San Francisco I wandered into a
demonstration on Market Street of 100,000 or so mainly Latinos - though here
were Chinese, Filipino's and other 'delegations' - all in support of the
immigrant rights. Furthermore it was undoubtedly the largest demonstration
of working class people that I have ever witnessed.

 The interesting thing to me is that these massive demonstrations across the
country were not independently initiated by immigrant group, but they were
provoked by pending legislation intended to criminalize and deport large
segments of the immigrant populations.

The irony of this witlessly, bigoted Republican House majority is that they
have provoked a moment of great transformation in - particularly - the
Latino (Hispanic) communities of this country. Anybody walking in these
marches today - with the sheer size and determination of the marchers (many
obviously overcoming barriers of fear and intimidation) - could not help but
experience the sensation that a large community amongst us has just begun to
go through one huge transfiguration. Quite amazing.

Hi all,

If anyone wants a vacation from NYC without spending much money, think
of this:

We are looking to rent our sunny, airy house in the village of
Rhinebeck New York (1 1/2 hours North of NYC) from May 12 to June 4
(give or take). The house has a living room, dining room, kitchen,
half-bathroom and two offices (one with a bed/couch) on the first floor
and two bedrooms and a large full bath with a clawfoot tub upstairs.
There is a large rocking chair front porch, several small gardens with
flowers and a big, private back yard. The house includes AC upstairs, a
TV with DVD player/ VCR/cable, stereo/CD player, high speed internet
and lots of books and CDs.

Although our street is quiet and pastoral, we are also a two-minute
walk to Rhinebeck Center, which has great restaurants, a few bars, a
bookstore, and many amenities (including a yoga studio and healthfood
store).

The Rhinecliff train station (Amtrak's Hudson line) is a five minute
drive away.

We have a 2 1/2 year old and so the house has kiddie stuff inside and
out...this can be ignored/put away or, if you've got kids yourself,
used all day long...

We are charging very cheap (and negotiable) rent in exchange for a
renter who will water our plants and take care of our cat. The cat is
old and sleepy and requires only food in her bowl, a clean litter box
(which is in a mudroom) and some sweetness and love. She sleeps 90% of
the day...

Roger- When one takes away faith, everything you say pretty much comes into
play. The difference between Fundamentalist Faith (and for that matter
Protestant Faith) is that for them the only thing of importance is Sola
Scriptura. Everything else is not to be trusted.

For Catholics and all of the Eastern Churchs (Russian Orthodox, Greek
Orthodox, etc.) it is a matter of tradition and scripture. The huge
difference would take a book to adequately cover, and for the most part this
group of churches defines itself by the ideal of succession. For these
groups, the Bible was written by humans and bears the mark of those people.
The bible is, however, the word of God given through men. There is a whole
theology of how God almost always works indirectly through people, not
directly. In addition, I had read some of what Bart has mentioned in the
first Catholic study of the New Testament that I was asked to read by a
Catholic monk and I am sure Christian scholars come across these problems
everyday without losing faith. I guess the thing I notice most is that Bart
has very little trust in the early Christian church.

I guess in a sense Bart does have some right to his fifteen minutes.

Stephen,

What effect do you think the carrying of foreign flags in the demonstrations
will have?

Here in Chicago we had over 400,000 marchers and it was very mixed about 60%
latino but also Polish, Irish and South Asian. It was a peaceful and great
protest.

I think that in Cities with immigrant traditions things will be ok... In the
Chicago area 80% of the people have at least one grandparent who immigrated
to America. But the fact is in NASCAR America we are going to see a
backlash. I watched Fox News last night when I got home and it was like
watching another world our protests here were very positive, even Francis
Cardinal George participated along with many other Religious leaders
But I think that there is going to be a backlash which Fox news is
fomenting.

In 1926 when the first US immigration law was passed (All Immigrants before
1926 had to do was arrive and they were legal) the US Government set quotas
to reduce the number of Non White immigrants. In 1926 Whites were defined as
Anglo Saxons, Scandinavians and Germans. Italian, Jews, Poles, Turks, Arabs,
and other Slavs were quotaed as Non Whites and this law existed until 1965.
We are heading toward a situation like this again I fear because people are
scared and now they have media to promote their fears.  Just watch the
O'Reilly Factor.

The best thing about yesterday was that we marched through Haymarket Square,
the place where MAY DAY was born. When the Foxnewsers say May Day is a
communist holiday they should know that it was born because of the Haymarket
Square Riots in Chicago.

The majority of flags I saw in San Francisco were those of the USA. The fact
of which, one may suspect, may be just as provocative to the racial purists
and anti-immigrant folks on 'the other side.'

Since "foreign" anything is often assumed to be "lesser" or "inferior", I am
wondering if instead of saying, "foreign flags", it would be much more
beneficial and accurate to say, "global flags."

Last night looking at CNN's Lou Dobbs, I found myself being really offended
every time he said, "illegal alien", (instead of, say, "undocumented
worker"). His manner of pronunciation - the tone of which is implicitly
disparaging - reminds me of the way racist Southern Senators (during the
sixties' fights over ending legalized segregation) would pronounce, "Negros"
in a way as close as they could to the sound of "nigger.'

There were many handwritten signs yesterday on the SF march - carried by
both adults and children - that said, "I am a Human Being. I am Not an
Alien."  The use of the word "alien" is clearly heard by 'the subject' as
dehumanizing and repugnant. In my opinion, Dobb's behavior clearly is
repugnant and should be publicly damned as racist and intended as
provocative hate speech.

Re Fox and 'backlash'. We clearly had a version of a slave uprising
yesterday. Of course,  Fox (Murdoch & Co.) are freaked out and were quick to
rush out the idea there will be a 'backlash'. What are they going to do? Put
together box cars for 11 million folks to go back south on?  Encourage home
owners in gated communities to first abuse then fire their domestic staffs
and the construction crews who are installing granite tops in their
kitchens? Go into the Cities and take shots at the day laborers who are
hired by the contractors that provide the cheap labor from which these
owners profit.     Whether on Iraq or whatever, Fox perpetuates a power
charade that appears - poll by poll - to be finally collapsing. Maybe by
Friday - the day Karl Rove will apparently be finally indicted - they will
switch gears and wrestle on how to put a positive weekend spin on the fall
of one of their own. Fortunately the NBA play-offs are getting hot and much
better to my eye.

actually, the passage of anti-Asian exclusion laws has long been a favorite
pastime of American legislators, beginning in the 1850s against the Chinese
and culminating in 1924, when Congress prohibited new immigration by all
peoples of Asian descent, excluding Filipinos. (A new act ten years later
would strip Filipinos of their national status, and include them in the
ban.) of course, we should credit the writing of the 1790 law granting
citizenship in this country to free white persons alone for
setting the tone, and not until the mid-60s, as you offer, do we
see legislators eliminate the national origins quota entirely.

Asians presently make up a third of the illegal immigrant population in the
U.S., a profound number that sadly hasn't been reflected much, if at
all, in the media's coverage of the current immigration bill and debate.

For Bay Area folks, SF Cinematheque will be
screening this doc along with some of Menken's
own films next fall in San Francisco.

Somewhat sooner, on June 11th to be exact, The
Poetry Center and Cinematheque are presenting
films of Bay Area poet/painter/iconoclast WELDON
KEES.

A week later, on June 18th, we're teaming up
again to screen POLIS IS THIS, the documentary
on Charles Olson that showed recently in New
York.  The director Henry Ferrini will be
joining us in person.

Hello poetry community! Small Press Traffic is pleased to be cosponsoring an
event that ought to be really lovely & fascinating, the release party for the
new anthology BAY POETICS. I hope to see you there-- Elizabeth

Sunday, May 21 at 7 PM
**at 21 Grand in Oakland**
FREE

Release Party for BAY POETICS
Brought to you by SPT (http://www.sptraffic.org/)
New Yipes (http://newyipes.blogspot.com)
and Faux Press (http://www.fauxpress.com/)

10 contributors read writing from *someone else* in
the anthology.

Readers will include Micah Ballard, Aja Duncan, Kevin
Killian, Ronald Palmer, Barbara Jane Reyes, Kit
Robinson, Jocelyn Saidenberg, Cynthia Sailers and
others. Whose work they'll read is a mystery!

7-9 p.m., free
@ 21 Grand
416 25th St. (at Broadway), Oakland

In 1961 Jack Spicer wrote, "It is not unfair to say
that a city is a collection of humans. Human beings.
In their municipal trust they sit together in cities.
They talk together in cities. They form groups. Even
when they do not form groups they sit alone together
in cities." In 2004 Stephanie Young was given her
assignment: to convene a collection of writing by Bay
Area poets. In 2006 the long-anticipated results are
in, all 496 pages of them. A precedent-breaking
anthology, BAY POETICS goes to the outer limits of
'local' and 'poetry', ranging as it does from Napa
Valley to Santa Cruz and including poems, essays,
lists, short fiction, walking tour reports,
manifestoes and all points in between. An experiment
in 21st century landscape portraiture you won't want
to miss.

Rod Smith began the journal Aerial in 1984, and published the first Edge
Book in 1989. During the 1990s the DC-based press became one of the major
publishers of innovative poetry in the United States.

Authors published by Edge over the years include Charles Bernstein, John
Cage, Kevin Davies, Heather Fuller, Lyn Hejinian, Jennifer Moxley, Tom
Raworth, and Leslie Scalapino. There are three new titles from Edge this
Spring: Some Notes on My Programming by Anselm Berrigan, Once Upon a
Neoliberal Rocket Badge by Jules Boykoff, and Cipher/Civilian by Leslie
Bumstead.

Forthcoming from Edge this summer is K. Silem Mohammad's Breathalyzer,
famous and occasionally infamous for his association with "Flarf," a kind of
poetry written using the google search engine. Aerial 10 will appear this
fall, a 300 page feature on poet Lyn Hejinian, including   essays, poetry,
interviews, and collaborations.

Anselm Berrigan is Artistic Director of the Poetry Project at St Mark's
Church. His latest collection, Some Notes on My Programming, is just out
from Edge.

Rob Fitterman's ongoing long poem, Metropolis, crosses three volumes to
date. He teaches at NYU.

Mel Nichols is the author of Day Poems. She teaches Digital Poetry at George
Mason University.

Rod Smith is the editor/publisher of Edge Books. Narrow House Recording
issued a CD of his work, Fear the Sky, last year.

I feel tractor has a full-length CD forthcoming from Goodbye Better Records
later in the Spring, "Once I had an Earthquake."

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the list has
about 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial number of
nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web site (see
archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep in mind
the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support
and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one: in
most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the list,
and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv editorial
board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which calls for all
messages to be read and approved before being forwarded to the list. We
prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the spontaneity of discussion
that we hope to promote. In addition to these options, the editorial
board will unsubscribe individuals if they are not, in our opinion,
productively contributing to the list or following our guidelines. We
remain committed to this editorial function as a defining element of the
Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about this
list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The
idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather than
general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list relatively
small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the list are
generally 50 messages per day, and one or two messages per subscriber
per day; but these limits are subject to change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the EPC.

2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions
of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. We strongly
encourage subscribers to post information, including web links, relating
to publications (print and internet), reading series, and blogs that
they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear. Such
announcements constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly to
the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in automatic
deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy, should
be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the
"from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.
Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post will be
unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu
this one-line message with no "subject": sub poetics [your Firstname and
Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and not
receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to the
list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics nomail.
Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with the
author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you can
also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or in
HTML format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set
poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or digest
mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of time. Your
account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics messages as well as
other important mail. In such cases, switch your subscription to
"nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then
resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racial
slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than
their work is attacked; in other words while critique of a person's work
is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list),
this critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes competing
interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with our
collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent
in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for
all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from
this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's
permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of
published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that you
get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see
if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not
posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to
contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

http://www.saltpublishing.com/books/smp/184471246X.htm


Publisher=B9s blurb:

blue grass is the fifth book of poetry by Peter Minter. Fierce in its
attitude to life, visionary in its philosophical curiosity and fluent in it=
s
study of traditional and contemporary poetics from around the world, blue
grass heralds the renewal of an engaged lyrical voice in Australian and
international poetry.

Opening with a Homeric challenge to the contemporary imagination, to go

> eastward into another land,
> the bluegrass plain

and

>                find
> what there is to say
> of transformation, the sparkle, junk
> & greenest hearts

blue grass embarks on an epic journey through extraordinarily everyday
personal, natural and cultural landscapes.

The book is arranged across four parts, History of the Present, Auto Heaven=
,
Australiana and Fresh Kills, and is interwoven by the Yonder Sonnets, an
innovative series of meditations on journey and habitation. Minter draws on
a range of modern European and American explorations in thought and form an=
d
remixes them with invigorating studies of traditions in voice and image.

The poems are readable and alert. They offer intimate and careful
observations of places and people that are disarmingly precise in their
detail. They reflect on politics, war and environmental devastation
alongside avowals of being and relating. They sample images and riffs from
popular culture, literature, music, news, art and film, throwing daily life
into relief against a resilient, organically shared history. Few poets
accomplish such an original balance between street-smart enquiry, closely
felt meditation and poetic experimentation.

Above all, the poems are affirmations of existence. They are the work of a
mature and daring imagination. They know that a deep appreciation of life=B9s
fragility must be founded in positive acknowledgements of worldly things an=
d
relations, or more simply, in acts of love.

Peter Minter=B9s achievement is the invention of a radically contemporary
lyricism =8B confirming his reputation as one of the most relevant and
groundbreaking poets writing in Australia today.

BEFORE I start bitching (which I promise I will) let me say some things  about
this anthology which makes me happy.

One of the most exciting things for me was to see that remarkable little  poem
by Joseph Ceravolo from WILD FLOWERS OUT OF GAS:

-------------
Rain

Rain is not surrounded by sleep like a drum
that pours song for song
all the body's soft weakness.
That's why I'm afraid.

So I don't feel sorry,
o chatter of birds' wings in
the clouds.
-------------

Wow, LOVE that poem!  LOVELOVELOVE IT!  I dislike 99% of the  times
and ways 99% of poets DARE USE similes, but Ceravolo never  disappoints!
The simile is usually --it seems-- used when a poet is LAZY!  But here  it's
a delicate sense its alliteration unfurls directly to our feet.   MMMMmmM!
This poem has been out of print for DECADES too!  Of the six  Ceravolo
poems in the anthology, this is the one not included in the selected  poems:
THE GREEN LAKE IS AWAKE.  It's high time for a COMPLETE  collection.
It's clear that this world cannot STAND being without it!  C'mon  now!
Some of the THINGS in print and NO Complete Joseph  Ceravolo!!!!!?!!!!!?!!!!!?

Just when I was thinking that Ceravolo has got to be the most out of  print
of the lot in the anthology I saw that Joan Murray was in there!

Shanna Compton was generous in creating a PDF file of the  entire
manuscript of Murray's which won the Yale Younger Poets, which is  linked
up in the NEGLECTORINO Project:  _http://NEGLECTORNIO.blogspot.com_
(http://neglectornio.blogspot.com/)

So many other poets I was happy to see included.  Jack Spicer is  there,
of course, and I say of course because it's DIFFICULT to imagine putting  out
an anthology with poets who shifted the paradigm and NOT include him!

(a second of bitching about William Logan's IDIOTIC review of the  anthology
in the New York Times:  William dear, Ashbery has more talent in  his
turds than anything you could possibly squeeze out!  And anyone  who knows
what's dynamite in poems knows how to laugh at William Logan,  heartily!
Let's just laugh at the bitch!  William Logan, you're a FUCKING  JOKE!
Seriously dear William, you are an actual joke, a PUNCH line who is  so
exciting to PUNCH with a good laugh.  Dear Fuckface, Dear William  dear...)

Whenever I see these sort of anthologies I can't help but think about
who is missing.  Meaning who I think is GREAT!  Assuming an  anthologist
is working on the who is GREAT premise, which, well, aren't they?

Last night I was looking over the anthology with my good friend Frank
Sherlock,
and we came up with this partial list of the missing:
Kenneth Patchen, Carl Rakosi, Harryette Mullen, Diane DaPrima, Gil  Ott,
Ron Silliman, Lewis Warsh, Ed Dorn, Joanne Kyger, Leslie Scalapino,
Eileen Myles, Tim Dlugos, Bob Kaufman, Lorenzo Thomas, Craig Watson,
Cid Corman, Jonathan Williams, Laurie Anderson (yes, the  musician/artist),
John Cage, Amiri Baraka, Judy Grahan, James Broughton, Larry Eigner,
Clark Coolidge, Philip Lamantia, John Giorno, Richard Brautigan, John
Wieners,
Kevin Killian, Joan Retallack, James Laughlin, Robert Peters, Stephen  Jonas,

Okay, let me just say it.  TEN PAGES OF BILLY COLLINS (the Phil  Collins
of poetry mind you!) and not ONE FUCKING PAGE for Clark Coolidge!?
Not ONE FUCKING PAGE for Ron Silliman!?  C'mon, how can you have  a
serious conversation about WHAT AND WHO is making poetry and making
poetics tick and click and not include these two!?

Billy Collins is doing his thing, okay, whatever, it's not anything I like,
but, hey,
he's doing it.  He's writing.  People love him.  Everywhere  apparently. But
he's a
bit of an asshole.  He goes out of his way to "confront"  experimentation in
the MOST
absurd ways, like, through young women who say to him (this is a  paraphrased
quote
from the introduction to an anthology he edited which I do NOT own), "Mr.
Collins, when
I read a modern poem I feel like my brother is holding my head under  water."
I'm quite
serious about this quote, although I don't have it right.  He USES  this
young woman,
uses this throwback to the distressed damsel in order to shoot arrows at
ANYTHING
that might challenge Phil, I mean Billy's poor little mind. TEN FUCKING
PAGES!
Is there NO justice in this FUCKING WORLD!?

Okay, I'm going to say THIS TOO!  It's no WONDER when I meet poets and  others
from Europe who say American poetry is boring!  I've heard this a  lot.  And
then I have
to have these discussions which sometimes becomes arguments to make it  clear
that
the MOST published poets don't have anything to do with the most exciting,
or, the
real talent.  We have BASHED the world over the head with Billy  Collins.
Well, not
WE, but American publishers have.  Billy Collins how the fuck did he  get to
where he
is saying the shit he says about poetry and where it comes from?

Geesh!  It's so hard to take there's TEN PAGES of him!  Charles  Olson gets
one poem.
It's a few pages long, but, ONE POEM!  ONE!

Well, the GOOD NEWS IS that folks in Europe picking up this anthology will
get a taste
of SOME of the real talent in poetry in America.  In fact it's a  marvelous
thing to HAVE
the mix available.  Let people FINALLY SEE FOR THEMSELVES!

Some folks have written saying that the NEGLECTORINO Project
link is not working.  Whoops, here it is:  _http://NEGLECTORINO.blogspot.com_
(http://NEGLECTORINO.blogspot.com)

Also a few asking what else is good in the anthology.  Well, you  should
pick it up, but okay....

I'm not going to lay out the entire table of contents, so let me JUST  deal
with some of the poets who are from the last century:  William Bronk  (how
great is it to see him here!?  Made ME happy!), Charles Bukowski  (c'mon,
he's been fun for as long as you can remember, Bukowski helped create
more room for the working classes in poetry than anyone else, maybe
ever actually), Jack Spicer (an anthology of this kind without Spicer is  a
tofu pot roast without the damn nutmeg, it would be tasteless, it would  be
a meal to forget.  Besides, do you really think TROUT FISHING IN  AMERICA
would exist had Brautigan not met Spicer?  I think not!), Robert  Creeley
(even William Logan has to agree on Creeley!  And I believe he  does),
Allen Ginsberg (whose genius will survive the abuse you imagine is  doing
his poems harm), Frank O'Hara (who wouldn't go back in time to make
CERTAIN his every need was fulfilled?  I'd scrub the cheese out of  his
toes and hunt high and low even very low to find a mother for the  child
he never had.  Maybe if I could ACTUALLY go back in time then I  could
ACTUALLY go back in time as a woman and have his baby myself, and
Alice Neel could paint little Chozmilla O'Hara on daddy's knee!   SMILE
FOR DADDY AND MISS NEEL CHOZMILLA!  I'd be a scary mother, so
maybe I do need to find someone else while I'm back in time.), Lew  Welch
(C'MON!  "The Basic Con" is NO con-game man!), John Ashbery (we
salute you Mr. Ashbery, and vow to shit on William Logan's doorstep  just
as soon as we get the address!), Anne Sexton (I don't care how many
people hate her, I think she's GREAT!  Even when I read a poem I  don't
really like I still like the attitude!  She had guts!  And by the  way,
there's
plenty of fantastic Sexton poems!  And, it was marvelous to see  Jerome
Rothenberg and Pierre Joris publish HER instead of Plath and Co. to
represent --or as some would say to justify-- the Confessionalists),
Ted Berrigan (whose life wasn't changed upon first reading Mr.  Berrigan?
Don't lie to me, don't you dare!  Am I being poor little Chozmilla's  scary
mother again here?  So sorry Chozmilla my dear one!), Joseph  Ceravolo
(my boyfriend Norberto almost has identical lips to Ceravolo, but  Norberto
HATES Ceravolo's poems!  It's a terrible thing to have someone you  Love
HATE Ceravolo's poems!  It's almost too much!  Okay, I promise to  stop
writing about my boyfriend's lips and my imaginary daughter with  O'Hara.
But who wouldn't want to have sex with O'Hara?  Go back in time,  push
him out of the way of the dune buggy, watch the sun come up?  How  nice!),
Russell Edson (if ever you get your ass down to North Carolina,  Jonathan
Williams will turn you onto Edson, like he did me, and show you some
Edson chapbooks made at Black Mountain College, it's FANTASTIC  STUFF!),
Fanny Howe (her amazing "9-11-01" here!), Lyn Hejinian (her MY LIFE  is
another life you thought was your own, "Because children will spill food,  one
needs a dog.  Rubber books for bathtubs.  Coast laps.  One  had merely to
turn around in order to see it.  Elbows off the table."  No  Chozilla dear,
that
was Lyn Hejinian, not MOMMY saying that!), Ann Lauterbach (leave  it to
yet another brave woman poet to write about 9/11 with her "Hum"), James  Tate
(one of the last great poets to win the Yale), Bernadette Mayer (who can  be
traced back to Lucy, some call Eve), Alice Notely (the one poet if you  have
anything unkind to say about you better hope I'm not in the room.   Instead of
tracing Notely back to Lucy or Eve, one day many years from now poets  will
be traced back to Notley), Rae Armantrout (have you ever read her  poem
"Articulation" ? READ IT!  And hear HER read it on PENNSOUND  while
you're at it:  _http://www.writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Armantrout.html_
(http://www.writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Armantrout.html) ),
Charles Bernstein and Bob Perelman who we all know and love and  I've been
writing too much now getting loopy doing this, there's also Anne  Carson
who William Logan complained about because she's Canadian but he had
nothing to say about Mina Loy being British hmmm, wonder why? i mean
even Pound couldn't seem to get that right.  there's that incident  with
Rexroth
correcting Pound for saying Mina Loy and Marianne Moore were the best
American poets along with H.D., but then again, maybe Pound meant it
didn't matter that Loy was FROM England because she WAS an American
poet writing American poetry.  Who knows at this point, and I'm kind  of tired
of writing now, not much sleep last night.  CAConrad

Last evening, Lynda and I trained over to Newark for the opening
of our old friend Miriam Beerman's new show at the Aljira center's
gallery on Broad Street (#591, just a walk from Newark's Penn Station).
Her splendid new show is called "Bending the Bend" and will be on
until July 8.

The gallery's website is at www.aljira.org, and, if you're not familiar
with Miriam's work, you'll find an excellent introduction at
http://www.miriambeerman.com/index.html.

Enjoy!

Yes Kevin, I know people get sick of hearing about Bukowski,
and they get sick of hearing about class.

But let me tell you that I've met a LOT of working class men (a  couple
of women, all of whom are working class lesbians I know) who came
to poetry through Bukowski.

He's not someone I've read in years, but I remember how much his
poems spoke to me, about my life, my family.  No, not pleasant,
but beautiful in the drive WITH it under the arm.

What I remember most are the people I have met who have come
to poetry BECAUSE of Bukowski.  There was this poet I knew
in Pittsburgh back in the early 90s who worked in a factory, his
father before him at the steel plant, and he would get up in front
of his friends at this bar, read his poems, and cry.  Or maybe  he
just cried that one time, when I was there?  And he LOVED by
the way, the poems of Mina Loy.  He came to Mina Loy by way
of Bukowski because of coming to poetry in the first place.

Bukowski is a door thrown open!

Poetry is for everyone, and Bukowski demands that to be true.

But look how many people say just the same about Billy Collins. If you're
going to accept the "door thrown open" theory, then what price Wallace
Stevens?

Yes, I must agree with you about Billy Collins bringing people to  poetry.
But Billy Collins is much more in the strain of the Let's Not Strain
Ourselves crew.  So, he's more apt to attract such folks.  I  mean,
he actually SAYS to this young woman in the introduction to the  anthology
he edited that poetry SHOULDN'T be so hard.  Whatever that means to  him.

Bukowski is not DIFFICULT to read mind you, I'm not saying that.  But  he
challenges barriers while Collins reinforces them.

Bukowski wrote thousands and thousands of poems and they all seem to
be the same to me at this point in my life, but still, he gets people  reading
who can jump into other things.

Bukowski is often considered to be with the Beats.  The Beats are  EXACTLY
what I am talking about, this group of poets who excite young readers,  and
lead them to many other forms of writing later.  It is hard for  me to
imagine
Billy Collins leading anyone to Mina Loy.  At the most Mark Strand,  or
William fucking Logan.

     I had heard vaguely about Billy Collins and once looked at one
of his books prominently on display in a book store.
      It made me suddenly have a hilarious hallucinatory nostalgia for the
days when Rod McKuen was King, cranking out books and making long playing
records--
      A lot of kids I know who like Bukowski and some of the Beats also like
Rimbaud a lot. It's in good part the combinations of writing and lifestyles
and attitude esp towards authority.  And those writers do lead on to a great
many very interesting other ones--to say the least!

I haven't seen the anthology so I can't comment on it. But Bukowksi has made
more people interested in poetry, just as the Beats did. I always considered
him more of a working class poet than a Beat, but he opened the doors to
that class of readers, just as Kerouac's working class background made
writing seem like a possible career (or way of life) for me. And, just as
Dave Brubeck eventually led me to Monk, Trane, Mingus and beyond, so
Bukowksi and Kerouac opened the door that led to other doors opening one
after another.I've heard vaguely about Billy Collins and read a poem or two.
There's certainly nothing wrong with what he does, but it's just not the
kind of stuff I want to read or write.

and attitude esp towards authority.  And those writers do lead on to a great

many very interesting other ones--to say the least!

Oh, Chris! Tell it like it is!=20

But this begs the question: is there a "working class language? poetry?" I =
think once we get down to the kernel of it - that is, language - and it's p=
lace in the world (how it's spoken, what's spoken) then only can we see lit=
erariness (ornament) as an elitist prank on Literature.=20

C'mon, folks, what are we hiding when we say "the summer rain brought splin=
ters of heat to my brow, and, like a robin at sunset, sing to my stars for =
heaven's love"

See? I made that shit up. fuck that. FUCK that.

This thread gives me new hope in Bukowski. I always thought he was a chauva=
nist pig but, hey, when it comes down to it, he just states what we're all =
afraid to say. And I think the line is appropriate:

"Some People Never Go Crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead."

Some people never tell the truth. They rely on adjectives.

Big words from a little fish, but I stand behind it.

While many of you will have heard of Myung Mi Kim, Lynn Xu is the  amazing, soon-to-be-discovered Poet-of-the-Golden-Voice and everyone  who can should come out to be entranced (and everyone who comes out  will be entranced).  Please spread the word! Please come--

                                                      Myung Mi Kim’s books of poems include  Commons (University of California Press), DURA (Sun  & Moon), The Bounty (Chax Press), and Under Flag, winner of  the Multicultural Publisher’s Exchange Award (Kelsey St. Press). Anthology  appearances in Asian-American Literature: An Anthology, Moving  Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women, Premonitions: The Kaya  Anthology of New Asian North American Poetry, Primary Trouble: An Anthology of  Contemporary American Poetry and other collections. Honors include a  residency at Djerassi Resident Artists Program and awards from The Fund for  Poetry. She is Professor of English at SUNY-Buffalo.




  Lynn Xu was  born in Shanghai.   She is a graduate fellow at Brown's MFA program.  Her poems were selected  by Anne Carson as the winner of the 2006 Greg Grummer Contest: "these have  the passionate compression and quick syntactic spring of a John Donne lyric . .  . [but] the way these disintegrate gently into an imprecision which is sort of  raw, but even more thoughtful" (Carson).  In the summer Lynn wishes  to move away from Providence and  closer to water.  This will likely not happen.  Her poems are  forthcoming in The Canary and Phoebe.  Her first  chapbook, June, is out on Corollary Press.

Re-emphasizing on this note - sometime last year, I watched Sean Penn
reflect on a Bukowski poem that leaves him spellbound every time
he reads it. This was on CNN or CSPAN(?).

Wrong, wrong, wrong. Art is an elitist project of necessity. The very notion
of presenting some words in context to mean more than they would
ordinarily mean requires an audience that expects that context and a writer
who seeks to create it -- all moving away from the ordinary, moving toward
the elite. It cannot be otherwise. Anti-elite is anti-art. You cannot have art
without elitism. I can't say it plainer, or less artfully, than "Wrong, wrong,
wrong!"

here in LA, where Buk lived for a time, there is a core group of =
acolytes,
former wives, and girlfriends, though not too many of his postal worker
colleagues, and many of these folks are if not working class (many =
having no
day jobs or not blue collar day jobs) in pursuit of the Beat or of the
working class literati

there is a separate group of punk / post-punk writers and artists, and =
many
of them are from working class backgrounds; some of them are still =
working
artists, not owning homes, having insurance or stable family situations, =
and
living gig to gig, some of them are incredibly wealthy poets now

during my high school and college years, there was always a set of =
"literary
young men" who found Buk, the male Beats, alcohol, and misogyny all at =
the
same confusing time they seem to have been afraid that being a poet =
wasn't
butch enough

but I think in this discussion, these groups are getting exchanged for =
one
another

Marcus,

Do you mean to say that the poor & working class kids in my East Oakland
neighborhood are incapable of sharing and articipating in art because they
haven't been taught to appreciate the elitist mystification process that
John Berger tried to dispell 35 years ago?

Wrong, wrong, wrong. Art is an elitist project of necessity. The very notion
of presenting some words in context to mean more than they would
ordinarily mean requires an audience that expects that context and a writer
who seeks to create it -- all moving away from the ordinary, moving toward
the elite. It cannot be otherwise. Anti-elite is anti-art. You cannot have
art
without elitism. I can't say it plainer, or less artfully, than "Wrong,
wrong,
wrong!"

Would appreciate any backchannel on those interested in showcasing a unique perspective on life, in their words. Nonpolitical, but interested in sharing stories and really relevant ways of creative expression of the personal.

Buk used to frequent a bar down the street from where I lived in Philadelphia, and sometimes I think that many of us became poets through that specific connection, through that drink based dais.

  Even you Kevin, would have, had you the alacrity of surroundings when living elsewhere. How about you Conrad, are you in the experience of what I talk of? You are presupposed to be the Philly poet these days along with a scant number of others. What say thou? By the way, an apology would be nice, CA, for that nonsense a while back. Public is best and appreciated in all smiles.

  I suppose many fault Buk for the working class thing but it opened up many avenues for poets I know, even Billy Collins. I well remember reading with him a number of years back through a journal called West Branch; in fact we were all West Branch Poets, under the auspice of  Karl Patten, many of  whom are nationally known beyond me and Collins like Jim Daniels, Charles Rafferty, Colette Inez, Naton Leslie, Sandra Argricola, and were it not for Buk paving the way with Crucifix in a Death hand, there are many poets I know who would not be on the writing tract or on the mag submission route so I find that worthy, that his typer did that to so many, let alone, according to John Martin, allowed me to enjoy Reznikoff, Bromige and so many others.

  Today, I think in many ways that the reason our Pavement Saw book by Tony Gloeggler made it into a second run of 1000 this year is the influence that Buk had on the poetry reading audience, I mean except for Allen Ginsberg and Kenneth Patchen, who else lead international audiences so directly into this realm of an understandable and universal "working class" vernacular?

Not in the least. I mean to say that they are capable of sharing and
anticipating in art if someone shows them how to -- if someone initiates
them into the elite. I'm glad to hear you're doing that. In the case where
there is someone like you there to do it, your kids are not intellectually
poverty-stricken -- but think of all the kids who ARE intellectually poverty-
stricken because there is no one like you there to initiate them. THEY are
incapable of sharing and anticipating art (except in the most amazing cases
of auto-didacticism) not because they are dumb but because they are poor.

But to deny that it IS an elite into which you're initiating them is not merely
counter-productive, it's intellectually dishonest. You're fooling yourself into
thinking that poetry is a thing independent of its creation and appreciation
by people. It's not. Poetry is an artefact of human invention, not a thing that
would exist if there were no people, like gravity or rocks or Keith Richard.

The writing and appreciation of poetry is indeed an elite occupation. What
makes it less likely that poor kids or blue-collar kids will write or appreciate
it is a lack of people like you to initiate them. And you, I'm sure, have to
admit that even out of the kids who take the class not all of them actually
get it; and of those who get it not all of them become poets. It's an elitism of
choice, and good on you for giving them one.

Marcus

Schadenfreude

  If pushing a wing through
  an eggshell were easier, not
  entirely more daunting say
  cases of living, thousands
  of daisy cutters, 1000 lb/in²,
  “might-ah led one to meadows”
  , however miniscule, of quiet.
  But looking on long enough,
  one becomes: drowsy, in reeling,
  anemic, relative to naught.--
  And so what’s tossing a coin
  from this 7th floor overlook? It
  drops, plinks, almost soundless.

even managed to throw in a bit of the avant...

http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/index.html

[one love affair]* meditates on mud daubers, Duras, and the deaths of
mentally ill and drug-addicted lovers, blurring fiction, essay, and memoir
in an extended prose poem that is as much a study of how we read as it is a
treatise on the language of love affairs: a language of hidden messages,
coded words, cryptic gestures, and suspicion.

As with Jenny Boully's debut book The Body (Slope Editions, 2002), [one love
affair]* is full of gaps and fissures and "seduces its reader by drawing
unexpected but felicitous linkages between disparate citations from the
history of literature," a work that is "filled with the exegetical
projection of our own imagination" (Christian Bok, Maisonneuve). Told
through fragments that accrete through uncertain meanings, romanticized
memories, and fleeting moments rather than clear narrative or linear time,
[one love affair]* explores the spaces between too much and barely enough,
fecundity and decay, the sublime and the disgusting, wholeness and
emptiness, love and loneliness in a world where life can be interpreted as a
series of love affairs that are "unwilling to complete."

Jenny Boully is the author of The Body (Slope Editions, 2002). Her work has
been anthologized in The Best American Poetry 2002, Great American Prose
Poems: From Poe to the Present, and The Next American Essay and has appeared
in Boston Review, Seneca Review, Tarpaulin Sky, Coconut, and Conjunctions.
Her Book of Beginnings and Endings is forthcoming from Sarabande. Born in
Thailand and reared in Texas, she has studied at Hollins University and the
University of Notre Dame and is pursuing a Ph.D. at the Graduate Center of
the City University of New York. She divides her time between Brooklyn and a
small town in Texas.

*A million wallowing anemones, a thousand eyes peeping through, a thousand
spies shivering, unnamable endless flowerings, countless empty bottles,
twelve flowers, eleven trees, eight fruits, four vegetables, four peppers,
two enemas, two kidnappings, one accident, one suicide, one soothsayer, one
drowning, one nightclub called Juicy.

Folks,

I'm looking for writing conferences for some of my students who are =
either college juniors/seniors next fall or are graduates this May.  The =
RISD summer program just seems to be for high school students.

Does anyone out there know of anything?  It would be preferable to find =
them out on the East Coast, but I'd be interested in knowing of anything =
operating around the country.

Cheers,

Lea

     Charles Olson wrote & spoke of "a stance towards reality"--and the
great many kids I know who read Bukowksi, the Beats and Rimbaud for
poetry--it's the stance in part that attracts them--anti-authoritarian--and
also remanants of the Roamantic idea of the writer as hero combined with
later idea of the anti-hero--the two at same time--"be director of your own
movies made in Heaven" Kerouac wrote--you can be confessional but hard
core--sex drugs and rock'n'roll--and re a "working class vernacular"
Bukowski writes often of emulating "Hem" and "Dost"--again a heroic idea of
the Writer--even in the worst and ugliest circumstances, the writer seeing
truths and writing them as they are--is a form of heroism even in
anti-heroic situations--a rebellion--a stance towards reality--vernacular is
infused with an intenisty that raises it to another level--(Villon, Celine)
      in the 1930's you find a very great deal of "proletarian poetry" and
novels--a Writer like Bukowksi doesn't model himself on these--but the
"greats" like Hem and Dost--like any writer a drive for literay fame and
greatness--
       Bukowski, the Beats, Rimbaud--all use forms of excess to go after
truths they think to find--"the road of excess leads to the palace of
wisdom"--a Romantic idea--the altering of senses etc--in the hopes this will
also alter language and the ways in which it is used, to give it increased
powers--to change the self & world--there is a great attraction in this in
part because it isn't necessarily tied down to a poltical doctrine, a
rigidity--but is (esp with Bukowski!--& Kerouac-) more fluid--
        the stance towards reality is a great energy source to tap into for
writing--and appeal of Bukowski, Beats, Rimbaud to many i know is this--(i'm
talking abut pretty much all working class kids--and for Bukowski pretty
much all males--)

For the silent auction at this year's Forbidden Fruit, we will be =
featuring
literary "naming rights" auction items: chances for attendees to bid on =
the
right to have their name or a name of their choosing used in a writer's =
next
novel or screenplay. This idea was first implemented as a fundraiser by =
The
First Amendment Project as an eBay item and quickly became the "most
watched" auction on the site. The right to be named after a fictional
character holds a strong appeal for many because in addition to being =
such a
unique item, it is also priceless. For more information about the =
success of
auctioning literary naming rights, please visit:
http://ap.tbo.com/ap/florida/MGB4YWBASDE.html=20

PEN USA is requesting donations of naming rights opportunities from its
membership to be auctioned in the Forbidden Fruit silent auction. A =
winning
bidder of a naming rights auction item can expect anything from a =
fictional
character that shares their name and likeness to a science fiction / =
fantasy
planet that is their namesake; the choice of specific naming rights
parameters is determined by what each writer is willing and able to
incorporate into their work. By donating a naming right opportunity in =
your
next novel or screenplay, you will be contributing to PEN USA's ability =
to
continue its work to protect the first amendment, fight censorship, and
support the development of a diverse literary community.=20

Excellent thoughts David. Let's also understand Olson's stance is rooted
in a Whiteheadian cosmology, a paradigm shift of seismic proportions,
shifting from the Newtonian/Cartesian ethos of control, competition and
reductionism, to one of Holism, Partnership and Interconnectedness.
Shahar Bram's book on this source is critical for anyone wanting a deep
understanding of that:
http://www.bucknell.edu/News_Events/Publications/University_Press/Books/Additional_Titles/Charles_Olson_and_A._N._Whitehead.html

I have writtten on this subject recently, at:
http://www.globalvoicesradio.org/Dualism_and_Olsonian.htm
http://www.globalvoicesradio.org/The_Sound_of_the_Field_(1.19.06).htm  &
http://www.globalvoicesradio.org/Semester_3_Annotated_Bibliography.htm -
specifically on my thoughts regarding the Bram book.

I have studied this paradigm shift before studying Olson and did
interviews with Rupert Sheldrake, Father Matthew Fox, Jean Houston, Dr.
Larry Dossey and
others who shed light on this critical change in the Western Stance
toward reality. I think children REALLY get the change and I believe
poetry written
from this stance is something that resonates more deeply with them, but
academies tend to be out of the Newtonian model and without a strong
sense of individuation, young people will often cave under the pressures
of outside validation.

Thanks for opening this door David.

Participants in this class will create a series of "graphic =
poems"--layered
surfaces of documents, pages from old books, our own writings, and =
pieces of
everyday text. We'll start with investigative writing, researching =
events
and landscapes at the intersection of civic and personal history, =
fashioning
poems and prose from what we find. Then, by collaging, soaking, =
wrinkling,
writing, mark-making, and photocopying, our pages will gather the signs =
of
wear and tear, the look of history. Writers and artists we'll study =
include
Susan Howe, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Tom Phillips, Mary Kelly, Anselm =
Kiefer,
Eugenio Dittborn. No drawing experience is required; no purchase of
materials required.=20

Jill Magi, writer and visual artist, is the author of Threads, a hybrid =
work
of text and images forthcoming in 2006 from Futurepoem Books, and the
chapbook Cadastral Map, published by Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs. She
teaches at The City College/CUNY Center for Worker Education.=20

Art, wrote filmmaker Andrey Tarkovsky, is a means of assimilating the =
world,
an instrument for knowing it in the course of one's journey toward =
=93absolute
truth.=94 This workshop uses film to inspire and generate poems, seeking =
what
some filmmakers call the =93authentic,=94 bearing in mind that, as =
Tarkovsky
said, =93the indisputably functional role of art lies in the idea of =
knowing,
where the effect is expressed as shock, as catharsis.=94 Using films by =
recent
and contemporary auteurs, exercises using imagery, ideas, emotions, and
other elements from the films, and selected readings, the poet will tap =
into
his or her infinite capacity for =93knowing,=94 and view the world =
through its
lens.

Eric Gamalinda is the author of Zero Gravity, winner of the Asian =
American
Literary Award in 2000. In 2003 he won the Cultural Center of the
Philippines Independent Film and Video award for two experimental films. =
He
teaches at New York University and Columbia University. A new collection =
of
poems, Amigo Warfare, is forthcoming in 2007.=20

I'm not really sure what characteristics makes a working class poet.
For instance it's only in the last 5 years of my life that I've made
enough money to economically belong to the working class, but one of
my assumptions is a working class poet is writing to be read by other
inhabitants of the working class.... which would seem to exclude a
lot of the post-modern repertoire.  Here in southwest WI, in the land
of deep forests & organic dairy, a working class poet would be
someone like Garrison Keillor, and it wouldn't get much more racy
than that.

my assumptions is a working class poet is writing to be read by other
inhabitants of the working class.... which would seem to exclude a
lot of the post-modern repertoire.

but then you are making an argument that a poet/artist/what-have-you has
control over their audience. (who is reading them)
or am i missing something?

Jen Hofer
India Radfar
{}{}{}{}{}

JEN BERVIN, poet and visual artist, is the author of a non breaking =
space (http://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/clouds/pages/intro.html), Nets =
(Ugly Duckling 2004) and Under What Is Not Under (Potes & Poets 2001). =
Her work has been published in Aufgabe, Chain, Denver Quarterly, Fell =
Swoop, Five Finger Review, How2, Insurance, Poets & Poems (a =
collaboration with Alystyre Julian), and Web Conjunctions. Bervin has =
received a BFA and a Presidential Merit Scholarship from The School of =
the Art Institute of Chicago, an MA in Poetry from the University of =
Denver, an Edward M. Lannan Prize from the Academy of American Poets.  =
She teaches an Advanced Poetry Workshop at NYU,  co-curates Pratt's =
Friday Forum Reading Series with Brian Blanchfield, and directs the =
writing internships for Writing for Publication, Performance and Media =
at Pratt Institute.


JEN HOFER's recent publications include Sin puertas visibles: An =
Anthology of Contemporary Poetry by Mexican Women (University of =
Pittsburgh Press and Ediciones Sin Nombre, 2003), slide rule (subpress, =
2002), and the chapbooks lawless (Seeing Eye Books, 2003) and =
sexoPUROsexoVELOZ (translations of poetry by Dolores Dorantes, Seeing =
Eye Books, 2004). Her next books will be a full-length translation of =
Dorantes' sexoPUROsexoVELOZ, forthcoming from Kenning Editions, a =
translation of Laura Sol=F3rzano's lobo de labio, forthcoming from =
Action Books, and a book-length series of anti-war-manifesto-poems, =
titled one, forthcoming from Palm Press. Her poems and translations can =
be found in recent issues of 1913, Bomb, Bombay Gin and Primary Writing. =
She lives in Los Angeles, where she teaches poetics, works as a court =
interpreter, and is happily a founding member of the City of Angels =
Ladies' Bicycle Association, also known as The Whirly Girls.

INDIA RADFAR is the author of The Desire to Meet the Beautiful (Tender =
Buttons), India Poem (Pir Press) and Breathe. After earning a B.A. at =
Middlebury College in 1990, with intermittent studies at The Naropa =
Institute and the Aegean Center for Fine Arts, she came to live in New =
York City, encountering the large community of poets there through The =
Poetry Project and other reading venues. From 1992-94, she gave =
instruction in poetry to children in Bushwick, Brooklyn, which led to =
her present collaboration with anthropologist Jenny Fox on a book about =
the oral poetics of children. An extended stay in India followed by the =
death of her father, author and scholar of comparative religion, Lex =
Hixon, forced Radfar into a new space with her writing. Her first book, =
India Poem, published in 2002, bridges her personal world with that of =
the country for which she was named. In 2003, she read at the =
Renaissance Society of the University of Chicago, in conjunction with an =
Indian filmmaker. A former resident of Woodstock, N.Y., she currently =
lives in Los Angeles with her husband and son.=20

Marcus---

I can see your point here, but aren't you using the word "elite" in two
different ways, and conflating them.

You talk about initiating the economic poor into the intellectual and
artistic elite

But you don't talk about initiating the economic rich into the intellectual
and artistic elite (and, from what I see, except in the most amazing cases
of autodidacticism, being part of the economic elite doesn't necessarily
make one part of an artistic or intellectual elite)

Nor initiating the economic poor into the economic elite (I bring this point
up, because there's an implication in your argument that the poor are less
likely to understand the elitism of art, where in my experience it's more
often the case that poor people understand all to well the elitism of what
they may call "bougie" (is that the spelling?) art, and the resistance to it
has more to do with the usefulness of such art. It's not that they can't
master the code, it's that they are more aware that it is often not an
economically self-sustaining proposition.

Sorry if I find myself speaking in generalities here, but the acute
discrepency that is often felt in many poor people between being part of an
artistic or intellectual elite and the economic realities need to be
investigated further. There's often a price to be paid for being part
of an economic or intellectual elite, as you seem to be defining it,
and that price, in contemporary America at least, more often than not
may lead to people becoming even more economically poverty-stricken than
they were before, and it's understandable that one may not wish to continue
to create such an art (even if they have been 'initiated,' like, say,
Caliban)--or consider ways of redefining art and intellectual activities
in less elitist ways.

there's at least one glaring typo below (aside from the benign "to" for
"too")---which I better jump on quick--

I wrote "economic" but meant "artistic"---the corrected word is in capitals

Maybe just working with words- hoisting them up, cutting and arranging them
to fit both concept and shape -  makes one by definition a worker.
What defines 'class' (as a collusion of forces with others, ones that
provide the worker with financing, distribution and consequent power) is
currently an elusive proposition for most of us as such "workers".

Witness probably the majority of MFA's - degrees in one hand and 100
grand(+) debt in the other. This is aesthetics as long term panic,
deprivation, $$slavery. The powers (banks) give with one hand and knock out
with the other - so it seems. In any case, continuing to do the work under
this kind of pressure, takes a brave kind of foolery.

I would just suggest that making language that is intended to have
exclusive currency within a certain class is a limited proposition for
poetry and/or the poem.

Making the poem make money requires speaking to who or what class?

Folks,

I'm looking for writing conferences for some of my students who are either
college juniors/seniors next fall or are graduates this May.  The RISD
summer program just seems to be for high school students.

Does anyone out there know of anything?  It would be preferable to find them
out on the East Coast, but I'd be interested in knowing of anything
operating around the country.

Cheers,

Lea

Well, I hope I'm not using "elite" in two sense and not distinguishing
between them.

I'm trying to say that the chances of getting initiated into the artistic or
intellectual elite is much better for the economically elite for at least two
reasons: first, the students are more likely to see themselves as worthy of,
and with entry to, the one kind of elite if they're of another kind, and,
second, they're likely to have a lot better exposure to and teaching of the
values and tenets of the intellectual and artistic elite if they're of the
economic elite; and, third of two, they're more likely to see a path to
success in the intellectual or artistic elite, or have the resources to
experiment along the path of that success, if they're already part of the
economic elite.

I'm not saying that being part of the economic elite makes one part of the
artistic or intellectual elite -- it doesn't, and it can't: there is no royal road to
learning -- but it sure gives you a better chance at it if you want it.

Art isn't very useful, though, no matter what -- and thinking that it might be
of use in the way a car or a job might be of use is part of the evidence that
they haven't really broken the elitist code, in my judgment. Also, the
economically disadvantaged students don't have the family or personal
resources to support them, or help support them, in any attempt to achieve
any sort of career in the arts, where the bottom rung of the ladder is a good
deal higher and more slippery than in most other professions. My father
used to point out that the 20,000th best plumber in the country can make a
nice living but the 500th best violinist starves.

You've got to either so believe in yourself and your talent and in the system
that judges and nurtures or dismisses that talent that you're willing to
endure the economic disadvantages (as well as the social ones -- as when
all your friends are buying cars because they're in the plumbing trades and
you're still living with your parents and bumming rides because you're still
learning the violin), or you've got to be incredibly lucky.

It's not that the poor understand "all too well" the elitism, it's that they are
not taught to value the "life of the mind" because they're so concerned with
just getting from paycheck to paycheck that the life of the mind seems
pretty silly and affected -- bougie.

> It's not that they can't

Just so -- and most poor folks have not and will not internalize the notion
that the "life of the mind" is more valuable than a new car and a good job
and the like, and they don't have the family or personal resources to try to
have both "the good life" and "a good life".

All very true: we seem to be saying the same thing, in fact. But what you're
saying is that the poor are correct in their judgment that the life of the mind
is not worth living if the trade-off is poverty. It may be that if you start off in
poverty the notion of continuing in poverty by choice in order to pursue
one's art seems pretty silly if one has the skills to make a living to give up
that living in favor of the same kind of poverty you'd face if you didn't have
any skills. And, of course, if you and your family are pretty well-off, there
may be family resources to help you through the first rough years, and, if
you finally decide to give up you can always get a pretty good job based on
the pretty good education that you got in the pursuit of your art.

But in the end it all boils down to the same sauce: if you're poor, even if
you're very talented, you're not very likely to internalize the values of the
life of the mind, and if you're well-off, you still probably won't, but you may;
and if you do, you have a better chance of survival, and even of success.

How come every twenty years we gotta have this retro revival? I grew up in =
the eightees and these were the saddest years of my life. Now they gotta th=
row it back in my face. and all these old ladies like Def Leperd and Ozzy S=
tillborn and Journey gotta comeback.

I heard Bruce Springstein is doing this spirituals album or something on NP=
R. It actually sounds fantastic (for a moment there he sounds like Tom Wait=
s). Bruce, come back to Jersey -  we need you. I live in Baltimore. "I'm fr=
om NYC" Lee Ranaldo (whom I bear a striking resemblence).

Please, send the eighties back to back there.
No more retro please.

Look forward, y'alls.

Marcus, the bouncing subject of art as elitist is so important.  And I  say
bouncing because it's elitist in different ways, but in different  places.

Art as commodity is problematic.  BUT, don't you think that today  with
the LITERALLY thousands and thousands in art schools, in writing
programs, etc., not to mention the tens of thousands who have already
graduated, that we're hitting the BEAUTIFUL WATER MARK?

I mean to say, we really ARE moving past the ability to even keep  track
of who everyone is at this point so many of us, everywhere.   Meaning
that GROWING number of people who are believing the CAN be artists
and writers, believe they ARE, it's hard to see an elite standing  firm.

This is off the subject, but the whole "Outsider Art" world is pretty
much working class and poorer.  Jonathan Williams has quite an
amazing collection in his home in North Carolina I've been fortunate
enough to see firsthand.  Georgia Blizzard, etc.

The very fact they are classified as Outside is the question, right?
Why Outside?  And Outside what by the way?

Outside society?  Outside the elite art world?  Both and  more?

Back to the multitudes finding their Art, it's JUST IN THE NICK
OF TIME with the world in such a fucking mess.  We're going
to need all that creativity to put things back in place, or put them
into a new place.  Change requires a creative snap.

It's horrifying, but exciting, and beautiful, being alive today,
dontcha think?  CAConrad

April 1987 and were released as a cassette tape in 1990 as part of
Pat=E9 de Voix 4 (an imprint of Offerta Speciale, published by Carla
Bertola and Alberto Vitacchio). The voices of Carla Bertola and

PennSound is an ongoing project, committed to producing new audio
recordings and preserving existing audio archives. We intend to
provide as much documentation about individual recordings as possible;
new bibliographic information will be added over time. As part of the
PennSound project, the Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text & Image
(SCETI) in collaboration with the Annenberg Rare Book and Manuscript
Collection at the University of Pennsylvania is developing a
sophisticated cataloguing tool for all our sound files; this should be
available in about one year.

Here is a 6:21 Quicktime video I put together about the Jig-Sound project
that's in progress: http://vispo.com/bc/Sorenson3-4/Sorenson3-4.html

This video is an attempt to indicate where I'm trying to take the project.

The interactive Shockwave demos discussed in the video are online at
http://vispo.com/bc/a
http://vispo.com/dbcinema
http://vispo.com/bc/b/hills2.htm

Have been turned down on 2 proposals, so far, for funding for this project.
But didn't have the video for those proposals (nor the interactive Shockwave
for the earliest proposal) and am still working on a good written
presentation of the thang. Gonna make this puppy one way or another, though.

Not all music is art, any more than all writing is art. The term you use is too
broad in this instance. Lots of music is entertainment, not art. So, while the
poor and working class people certainly make music in their homes, the
question is whether they are making art. Not all concert hall music is art,
either -- I heard the Cleveland Orchestra in Severance Hall one year phone
in a performance of Mozart's Jupiter that made it less even than
entertainment.

Maybe so -- but if I understand "work made by and for non-elitists"
correctly, I call that work "entertainment" because it is neither intended as
nor perceived as "art" by the folks who make and enjoy it.

Once again, art is an elitist occupation by its nature, by necessity. The
point of distinguishing art from non-art is to appeal to people who are
looking for the art experience. Among those looking for the art experience,
some will mistake the place or the brand or something else for the art
experience. Appreciating art requires a kind of temperament that is not
universal, and enough education in the conventions of the arts within the
context of the culture to understand the intentional difference between
using different colors of paint to protect the house from the weather and
using different colors of paint to make art; between music to entertain and
music to make art; between language to order bricks and language to make
art; and so on.

I agree there is a wider scope than gallery, hall, review -- but not so
wide a scope that any collection of family members whacking away
at the kazoo is "making art".

This confuses "elite" with mere number, which I think mistakes entirely the
notion of an elite in art, or in any field of knowledge. I hold that there is
"good elite" and "bad elite". The "bad elite" is exclusive, it seeks to limit the
number of "us" and glories in the notion that there is a majority "them" who
are not good enough. The "good elite" is inclusive, it seeks excellence
wherever it is to be found, irrespective of number or otherness.

But I think you're wrong to hold that mere tens of thousands of graduates in
the liberal arts out of the hundreds of millions who make up just the US is
still a pretty small number. I don't hold that the number matters, but if you
do, then I want to point out that tens of thousands is a small number in
context.

But the elite, at least the "good elite", never does "stand firm". I'm not
advocating an exclusive elite that keeps the poor folk out; I'm advocating
an inclusive elite that seeks to find excellence where it exists. But
excellence, not just any old crap that's been ignored by the "bad elite". Not
only is propinquity not enough, being ignored, or dismissed, or even
denigrated by the "bad elite" is not enough to make something art.

Yeah, sure, tell me that

priapean is a measure
consisting of a glyconic
and a pherecratean (qqv)
separated by a diaeresis

is not elitist! Come on! Look at that poem by Jonathan Williams and
tell me that Tupac's crew would find it to be art. You know that isn't
right. And that's just the very first poem found on the first page of the
google search for "jonathan williams metafours". You even have to
know what a metaphor is and what a quatrain is and a little bit about
meter and scansion to appreciate the joke of "metafours".  However
"outside" Mr Williams and his critics and appreciators deem him to
be, he ain't so far outside but what you have to be in the elite to get
him.

Uh, gentlemen? Isn't the primary objection to Bukowski
related to his representation of women? I say this not
as any impressive insight, but because this stupidly
obvious point I'm making seems so far not to have come
up. My apologies if I missed something; it's likely I
haven't seen all the posts. And please note that I say
this as someone who does find significant value in the
working class elements of his writing that you all
have been discussing.

I don't think his perspective on women can
automatically be linked to a working class sensibility
in any simple sense, although undoubtedly that's part
of the issue.

The most interesting take on Bukowski I've read,
although I'm not completely sure I believe it, is Mike
Baskinski's claim that we need to read Bukowski's work
as an exploration/celebration of the American Dream
that is both satirical and serious simultaneously.
It's a great piece but I don't remember where it was
published.

Then we disagree on the scope of poetry and art. I prefer inclusion and it
seems you prefer exclusion. You're argument reminds me of Harold Bloom.

Jumpin Jack Flash Is A Gas Gas Gas

     The chapter, "Bombing the Big Apple," in Andrew Ross's The Chicago
Gangster Theory of Life hardly seems a promising first note to sound on
the subject of having a gas, as the Rolling Stones would have it, in
postwar American poetry. Ross draws an analogy between the 1993
car-bombing of the World Trade Center and the ecological and social
devastation of New York City by planners and their policies and impugns
the city leaders for destruction of another order than the 1993 effort
to fell the Twin Towers. Ross's argument has an unlikely beginning in
lines by Walt Whitman and Frank O'Hara, based on their use by the
Iranian-born artist, Siah Armajani, as part of a 1986 public art project
for the World Financial Center in Battery Park City. Ross recapitulates
the familiar image of O'Hara as the gay James Dean of The New American
Poetry generation by commenting on the unexpectedness of Armajani's
choice considering the "maverick" status of O'Hara compared to Frost,
Emerson, Melville and Whitman, all of whom Armajani has quoted in past
public art projects (100).
     On the contrary, as I hope to indicate with attention to two of
O'Hara's contemporaries, Jack Spicer and Stephen Jonas, one model of
traditional lyricism (monologism, autonomous form, grammatical and
syntactic order) is represented for these poets by O'Hara's work. The
1957 Meditations in an Emergency, the title poem for which happens to be
the source of the passage used by Armajani, is especially valuable for
locating this far from "maverick" O'Hara, when read alongside poetry
reacting against his poetry. O'Hara's example has the advantage that the
departure from his poetry is relatively free of the antagonism towards
the beat poets signaled in these acerbic lines by Jonas: "The Scene of
the Fifties: / trash / (white) / on the road" (95). These lines form the
whole of CLXIII in Jonas's Exercises for Ear, a book of 174 linked poems
written over a number of years and first published in 1968. Like
Spicer's 1965 Language, Jonas's volume offers the example of serial
structure, a significant departure from the mode of the single, separate
poem operating in Meditations in an Emergency. Neither should seriality
be dissociated from the foregrounding of language-functions, unstable
pronominal referents, volatile lexical registers, and especially in
Jonas's volume, the increasing fragmentation of line and word.
     Apart from the fact that the three poets were contemporaries, with
personal contact, correspondence, and publication in the same magazines
representing communication shared in varying degrees among them, they
also share the troubling distinction of belonging to a special category
of American poets whose real, writing lives have ended abruptly: O'Hara
(1926-1966), killed by accident; Spicer (1925-1965) dead of alcoholism;
and Jonas (192?-1970) dead of a drug overdose. In the literary history
of early modernism in America, Hart Crane's mercurial passage across the
1920s demonstrates how the spectacle of a poet's life can interfere with
the contemporary reception of their work and problematize future
readings and posthumous understandings, one example of which appears in
a comment Spicer makes in his Vancouver lectures:  "What Crane did was
to make all of his openness not metric but in terms of vocabulary . . .
he would use the metric as something he took as fairly stable, and the
vocabulary he spilled out all over the world" (15.06.65).
     In addition to associating O'Hara, Spicer and Jonas as
contemporaries whose lives and works bear the marks of minority sexual
identity, and in Jonas's work the marks as well of minority racial
identity, a further differentiation needs to be made with respect to
minority class identity, if the poetry of Spicer and Jonas can be
characterized as proletarian compared to O'Hara's work. However, not
only are Spicer and Jonas associated with bohemian literary circles in,
respectively, San Francisco and Boston, just as O'Hara is associated
with the vicissitudes of the New York City art world, but the term
"proletarian" in reference to their work is also tendentious, since
nowhere in their poetry do they consciously identify themselves as such,
whereas they take great care to make sexual and racial identifications.
     Bohemia in general in 1950s and later America might be considered
as a kind of urban wilderness, where social difference is effaced under
pretense of the pursuit of 'unmediated' art, just as in the American
National Park "the sublimity of an unpeopled landscape (its indigenous
inhabitants having long since been evicted) erases all the legacies of
social difference borne by visiting nature trekkers, and allows them to
transcend those social identities that are judged to be restrictive and
irrelevant in the face of unmediated Nature" (Ross 103). Or, as Spicer
puts it: "The country is not very well defined. / Whether they are
bat-people or real people. The sea- / Coast of Bohemia" (14). So the
marks of the mediation of social class in the poetry of Spicer and Jonas
are comparatively furtive, often layered into the representation of
sexual and/or racial difference, yet one of the places where the
articulation of class difference can be clearly discerned is on the
comic edges of their work, varieties of provocation and indignation
which derive from a poetic of powerlessness reminiscent of Derrida's
concept of unpower in his reading of Antonin Artaud.
     Derrida's translator points out that the French impouvoir which
appears as unpower in the Artaud essay appears as powerlessness in the
English translations of Artaud's Collected Works (419). Both terms would
seem equally adequate for approaching Spicer's Language and Jonas's
Exercises for Ear, though it should be noted that the problem of the
relation of speech to language addressed in Derrida's essay might be one
way to conceive of the space separating the two books. They function as
counterparts, each separately countering the kind of poetry represented
by Meditations in an Emergency. Through the experience of unpower,
Derrida's Artaud discovers the limits of thought, "the nothingness at
the heart of the word, the 'lack of being''' (215). This limit results
from the theft of speech from the speaker by the outside, the otherness
condition from which all words are spoken, "the fecundity of the other
breath [souffle] is unpower: not the absence but the radical
irresponsibility of speech, irresponsibility as the power and the origin
of speech" (221). Utterance is not articulation, but breath-space,
spirit-world, verbal impulse driven both towards and away from
signification, "the cultural field from which I must draw my words and
my syntax, the historical field which I must read by writing on
it" (224).
     The strong pull towards the unconscious which Spicer will formulate
as a poetics of dictation in his Vancouver lectures, and which for Jonas
surfaces under pressure of the many voices pushing through molecular
word-by-word spatial and auditory balancings, is read thus
parenthetically from Artaud by Derrida: "('In my unconsciousness it is
others whom I hear,' 1946)" (221).  As a result of this embeddedness of
multiple social voicings, "the signifier on its own says more than I
mean to say, and in relation to it, my meaning-to-say is submissive
rather than active" (224). Every page of O'Hara's Meditations in an
Emergency projects the poet as an active agent of a highly
individualized mock-heroic style, a comic abundance of what Jonas calls
"baroque adjective baubles," tempered by surrealist and futurist means
of acceleration and incongruity, but never departing from the syntactic
order and linear grid that prevent isolation of single words and within
words, parts and particles of speech: language structures.
"Morphogenesis" is the title of a poem by Jonas, not part of the
Exercises for Ear series, significantly subtitled, "(being a
conventionalization of 'Morphemes' by Jack Spicer)" (156).
     Given the condition of powerlessness, the impoverishment and
dispossession attendant to such an experience of ontological and
linguistic negation as Derrida locates in Artaud, and which I am
suggesting can be extended to Spicer and Jonas, it is remarkable that
neither poet arrives anywhere near proposing a theater of cruelty. In
"Transformations I" the statement that "no enemy in the universe is
worth having" appears among shifting references stretched across I, You,
He, We, They, Them-the statement itself further attenuated by an "out of
place" third-person possessive plural pronoun-investigating "enemy" and
"hate" and producing in the simple subject-verb-object statement
concluding the poem an indeterminant sense of just who is hating what or
whom:

	They say "he need (present) enemy (plural)"
	I am not them. This is the first transformation.
	They say "we need (present) no enemy (singular)"
		No enemy in the universe is their worth
		having. We is an intimate pronoun which
		shifts its context almost as the I
		blinks at it. Those
	Swans we saw in the garden coming out of
		the water we hated them. "Out of place,"
		you said in passing. Those swans and
		I (a blink in context), all out of place
		we hated you.
	He need (present) enemy (plural) and now
		it is the swans and me against you
	Everything out of place
	(And now another blink of moment) the last
		swan back in place. We
	Hated them. (37).
	
Characteristic for Spicer are the juxtaposed lines and enjambed endings
refusing expected word order. The heightened attention to pronouns whose
potential for expressing a stable subject position are reduced to a
"blink" in the landscape, if there is a landscape, such as in Yeats'
"The Wild Swans at Coole" (the association is not arbitrary, since
Yeats' theory of dictation is the starting point for Spicer's Vancouver
lectures (13.06.1965)), is abstracted to the blank slate of a syntactic
field where the phrase "out of place" reverberates three times against
the penultimate line's single "back in place." The poem is thinking
about the orderly procession of words in a line, "their" hated order,
and the enculturated meanings they police.
     The vocabulary is disconcertingly basic. The "last swan" in the
next-to-last line of "Transformations I" is more floating sign than word
designating something seen, and the narrated experience which involves
someone saying something to someone else about some place they once
visited is subordinated to analysis of the structure of saying it. Two
closely related observations from A Thousand Plateaus can help explain
what Spicer is doing here: "A rule of grammar is a power marker before
it is a syntactical marker"; and "language does not operate between
something seen (or felt) and something said, but always goes from saying
to saying" (Deleuze and Guattari 76). The concluding statement in
Spicer's text, "We / hated them," is arrived at by way of displacement
and dislocation, and closure, a momentary point of rest in the serial
poem, is attained by means of what Deleuze and Guattari call the "order
word" ("the elementary unit of language-the statement" (76)), and as
with Derrida's use of impouvoir from Artaud, the translator of A
Thousand Plateaus points out that mot d'ordre also means slogan and
password (523). Between beginning and ending, the two companion
utterances, "I am not them" and "We / hated them," as statements,
slogans and passwords, may very well loom over Spicer's Language as one
key to the sexual and class difference inscribed there.
      At another node in the cluster of possibilities for intensifying
awareness of social surfaces across which subjectivities migrate is the
practice of reported speech in Jonas's Exercises for  Ear. Deleuze and
Guattari note their debt to V. N. Volosinov's concept of indirect
discourse in their consideration of the importance for narration of
reported speech: "We believe that narrative consists not in
communicating what one has seen but in transmitting what one has heard,
what someone else said to you. . . . The 'first' language, or rather,
the first determination of language, is not the trope or metaphor but
indirect discourse" (76-7). Turning to Volosinov, the same term can be
found applied in a context close to Spicer and Jonas: "one can answer
questions as to 'how' and 'about what' so-and-so spoke, but 'what' he
said could be disclosed only by way of reporting his words, if only in
the form of indirect discourse" (149). What in Spicer is one mode among
a range of modes for incorporating social materials becomes in Jonas a
practice amounting to method for listening to the voice of the other. An
extreme instance is found in LXII where the poet disappears behind what
Deleuze and Guattari call the "hearsay":

		"i want you to get
	   dressed-up in your
		s.s. uniform and pretend
	i'm a prisoner of war and
	   then ask me questions i
	can' possibly answer
			i want you to
	call in your friends and
		have them stand aroun'
	and call me filthy names
		you can take me with you
	i'll be your slave . . ." (50).

This is Derrida's Artaud's submissive "meaning-to-say," reported speech
purporting masochist wish list, formally rendered by Jonas in two
roughly symmetrical thought-movements turning on the phrase "I want you
to" and closing with a promise disguised as an offer, as if Deleuze and
Guattari's example, "I make a promise by saying 'I love you,'" for
"these acts internal to speech, these immanent relations between
statements and acts" (77) could be located in a studied rendition of
sex-play abasement. In LXII from Exercises for Ear we begin to hear what
unpower sounds like. The poem demands of the reader the ability to
resist the conventional reflex inviting Adorno's stricture, 'no poetry
after Auschwitz,' especially poetry that plays with S.S. uniforms and
Hitler's face hallucinated by the postwar German public in a postage
stamp, when the ghetto, which carries with it always the perpetual
threat of containment and extermination, has only begun to be heard in
American poetry.
     Apropos LXII's haphazard, notational character of the found poem,
bearing in mind at the same time the bondage wish combining European
concentration camp and U.S. antebellum plantation fantasies, what we are
looking at is one example of Jonas's contingent approach to form,
typically responding if not basing itself on interruptions of speech.
That Jonas, in contrast to Derrida's Artaud, conceives of his poetry as
capable of thought is indicated by the initial lines of XXXIV: "thinking
in verse / to avoid / the medi- / ocre" (36). Dark colors burst and
splay the concluding (root) morpheme and its pun on the painter's ocher
pigment. The strong relation between sexuality and thought, the
sensuality of the idea, or physicality of the concept, is suggested in
LXXXV: "in the age of frescoes he / married the classic image / adding
to it his own / outraged agonies / depending from the lower limb / . . .
it is / an audacious willingness to experience" (61). It could be that
what Jonas is doing exists in the point of departure Derrida declares
from Maurice Blanchot's reading of Artaud: "'When we read these pages,
we learn what we cannot ever come to learn: that the fact of thinking
can only be overwhelming, that what is to be thought is that which turns
away from thought within thought, inexhaustibly exhausting itself within
thought; that to suffer and to think are linked in a secret
way'" (Blanchot qtd. in Derrida 216). With the exception that, in LXII,
we also encounter one aspect of Jonas's sense of humor.
     Where does laughter belong in representations of the experience of
oppression, and what are its limits? Pressing the problem of
"tragic-heroic tonality" and its obscene comic supplement, Slavoj Zizek
puts the question this way: "what, however, if one were to venture a
step further and claim that beauty 'as such' in its very notion, is
already something strangely abusive: namely, the abuse of the suffering
it uses (stages) in order to evoke the so-called 'aesthetic response' in
us?" (Totalitarianism 87). For Zizek, such abuse "reaches its limit, in
the case of the Holocaust," the more aesthetic its presentation, the
more obvious the abuse, making a mockery of fear and pity: "Perhaps this
is one way of understanding Adorno's much-quoted 'no poetry after
Auschwitz'?" (Totalitarianism  87).  Another way of understanding
Adorno's injunction could appeal to a formulation by Artaud which,
available in a 1958 English translation, suggests the harsh aspect of
the struggle for survival undergone by poets like Spicer and Jonas:
"[W]hen we speak the word 'life,' it must be understood we are not
referring to life as we know it from its surface of fact, but that
fragile, fluctuating center which forms never reach. And if there is
still one hellish, truly accursed thing in our time, it is our artistic
dallying with forms, instead of being like victims burnt at the stake,
signaling through the flames"  (qtd. in Derrida 225).
     If we consider Jonas's LXII as obscene comic supplement to the
"tragic-heroic tonality" of Sylvia Plath's "Daddy" (first published in
her 1965 Ariel, only three years before Exercises for Ear), then we
might conclude that Plath's poem stages abuse of suffering as aesthetic
affect and correspondingly the poem's conventional, symmetrical 'beauty'
might appear suspect, whether or not we follow Claire Brennan's reading
which brings "Daddy" close to the masochist fantasy 'overheard' in LXII:
"What she does in the poem is, with a weird detachment, to turn the
violence against herself so as to show that she can equal her oppressors
with her self-inflicted oppression. And this is the strategy of the
concentration camps" (qtd. in Zizek, Revolution 253).
     John Carlos Rowe reminds us that "the 'internal colonization'
thesis has been developed by a long list of distinguished scholars in
books and articles that are fundamental to American Studies as a
discipline" (5-6), and that this thesis encompasses "the definition and
regulation of 'proper' sexual 'morality' in order to police lesbians and
gays and/or 'purge' the nation of their 'deviance'" (5). It is not
impossible, then, to associate what  Zizek calls the "concentration camp
universe" with the internal colonization of sexual (racial/class)
minorities. One might even propose that the poetry of Jack Spicer and
Stephen Jonas belongs to the category of holocaust literature,
especially if the following passage from Giorgio Agamben's Homo Sacer
can be extended to include target subjects existing under
socio-political and cultural conditions of "biopolitical sovereignty":
"The Jew living under Nazism is the privileged negative referent of a
new biopolitical sovereignty and is as such a flagrant case of a Homo
Sacer in the sense of a life that may be killed but not
sacrificed" (qtd. in Hegarty).
     But the mention of Plath, like the mention of Bishop and Lowell in
Donald Allen's preface to The New American Poetry, or the mention of
Roethke and Berryman in Steve McCaffery's Prior to Meaning as prominent
representatives of the "metrically regulated poetries of the
1940s" (46), replays a fifty-year-old polemic in American poetry, and
many of the same features of what might be called a period style can
also be found in O'Hara's poetry. The variation in O'Hara is his
mock-heroic treatment of traditional subjects and pop-art appreciation
of ephemerality. In "Ode," for example, a series of disconnected
questions subverts any serious expectation occasioned by the poem's
time-honored title: "What are you amused by? a crisis / like a cow being
put on the payroll / with the concomitant investigations and
divinings? / Have you swept the dung from the tracks? / Am I a
door?" (31). These questions, which begin to resemble the kind posed to
game contestants, are capped by a something like a couplet which halts
the first movement: "To be equal? it's the worst! / Are we just muddy
instants?" (31). This "muddy instant" might recall Spicer's blink of the
transient subject in "Transformations I," though the address to St.
Serapion in O'Hara's title poem has the poet comparing his purity to
lotus and hyacinth, exploding into bloom "'to keep the filth of life
away,' yes, there, even in the heart, where the filth is pumped in and
slanders and pollutes and determines" (39). Transcendence, not Spicer's
(tramp, or camp) transience, is the motive force operating here.
     But it is in the "elegy" for James Dean, the most indignant poem in
this volume, invoking the gods, whatever pantheon they may belong to in
1950s America, Madison Avenue or Hollywood, "in the empty streets of New
York / I am its dirty feet and head / and he is dead" (41), where
scatological references are most forcefully made:

	I speak as one whose filth
	is like his own, of pride
	and speed and your terrible
	example nearer than the siren's speech,
	a spirit eager for the punishment
	which is your only recognition. (41).

In the next stanza the dreams of rats "are their own, as are the
toilets / of a great railway terminal" and this association of the
surrounding and inert social mass as subhuman, a void of conformity in
contrast to the dead hero, is developed in lines 50-57:

	the menials who surround him critically,
	languorously waiting for a
	final impertinence to rebel
	and enslave him, starlets and other
	glittering things in the hog-wallow,
	lunging mireward in their inane
	mothlike adoration of niggardly
	cares and stagnant respects . . . (42).

This recycles Pound's Cantos XIV and XV, where soil, mud, dung, sewers,
sows, "the great arse-hole, / broken with piles" (62), are enlisted in
condemnation of "betrayers of language" and the "slough of unamiable
liars" (63), much as O'Hara here uses scatological language to place
poet and hero above the polluted multitude of "menials." The poet's own
"filth" is his hubris, perhaps a counter-image to the purity of the
bursting locus and hyacinth as emblems of lyricism in the title poem.
Primary, however, is the declared "tragic-heroic" identification: "Men
cry from the grave while they still live / and now I am this dead man's
voice, / stammering, a little in the earth" (43). In "The death / that
young men hope for," one of a chain of metaphors for what poetry is
which begins Spicer's Language ("This ocean, humiliating in its
disguises"), a note is struck close to the spirit of "For James Dean"
and, perhaps, the concluding poem of O'Hara's volume, "Mayakovsky," if
the title can be understood as identifying the persona that speaks "the
catastrophe of my personality" (51) in association with the popular
legend of the Russian's poet's suicide as caused by the failure of a
revolution.
     "'Arf,' says Sandy," the opening line of the third in a suite of
nine "Love Poems" in Language, which might recall the comic-strip world
of 1960s pop artists or the reported speech of seals in San Francisco
bay, but attention to the many references to dogs across the nine-poem
section discloses a darker dimension, where "Sandy growls like a wolf"
and "Death is a dog and Little Orphan Annie / My own Eurydice" in the
third poem; "wolf with / the same toy gun" in the fourth poem; the
seventh poem's opening line, "The howling dog in my mind says
'Surrender'" and lines 8-9, "The dog / In my heart howls continuously at
you" culminate with the deceptively gleeful:

	I do not know where my heart is.
	My heart's in the highlands
	My heart is not here
	My heart's in the highlands
	A-chasing the deer. Dog
	Of my heart groans, howls
	Blind to guesses" (25).

Levity in the thick of the thought of fatality. The dog in these poems
read allegorically, like Dante's leopard, wolf and greyhound,
emblematizes instinct, drives-especially the death-drive, "Thanatos, the
death-plant in the skull" (12)-inarticulate animality, slavish
abasement, helplessness and powerlessness.
     The fourth of the "Love Poems" begins, "'If you don't believe in
god, don't quote / him,' Valery once said when he was / about to give up
poetry," and ends on these caustic lines: "It is deadly hard to worship
god, star, /  and totem. Deadly easy / To use them like worn-out
condoms / spattered by your own gleeful, crass, / and unworshipping /
Wisdom" (22). The argument in these poems and a thematic running
throughout Language is the positioning of poetry as religion but without
appeals to aestheticism, the irreducible social real entering in
multiple plays with the sport of baseball, the JFK assassination,
supermarket parking lots, and compressed in the sparse, minimalist
protest: "I / Can- / not / accord / sympathy / to / those / who / do /
not / recognize / The human crisis" (13). The "scatotheological
thematic" that Derrida reads in Artaud appears in Spicer in the second
of the "Love Poems":

	For you I would build a whole
		new  universe around myself. This
		isn't shit it is poetry. Shit
		Enters into it only as an image. The
		shit the ghostes feasted on in
		the Odyssey     When Odysseus
		gave them one dry fly and made
		them come up for something important
		Food.
	"For you I would build a whole new
		universe," the ghosts all cried, starving. (20).

Reading Artaud, Derrida asks: "Why is this original alienation conceived
as pollution, obscenity, 'filthiness,' etc.? (228). His eventual answer
interprets in Artaud an equation of God and defecation, paraphrasing the
French savant: "God is of my own creation, my double who slipped into
the difference that separates me from my origin, that is, into the
nothing that opens my history" (229). Derrida continues: "This history
of God is thus the history of the work as excrement. Scato-logy itself.
The work, as excrement, supposes separation and is produced within
separation" (229). Spicer invokes the Odyssey to project a consonant
nexus of associations between the sacred and profane. The dog functions
as a liminal figure of abjection and makes available a comic take on the
fundamental estrangement written into every line of the "dark forest of
words" in Language.
        A remark by Zizek about David Fincher's 1999 film, The Fight
Club, suggests one more reading of the scatological in Spicer, and one
that cannot be associated with O'Hara's poems, though possibly with
masochism in Jonas. As Zizek observes, "there is another dimension at
work in self-beating: the subject's scatological (excremental)
identification, which is equivalent to adopting the position of the
proletarian who has nothing to lose" (Revolution 252). In Spicer, such
self-beating--tied to the whipping-post, in the words of an old blues
lyric--the very possibility of life itself conceived as smear, appears
in the passage: "If I move my finger through a / candleflame, I know
that there / is nothing there. But if I hold my / finger there a few
minutes longer, / It blisters. / This is an act of will and the flame
is / is not really there for the candle, I / Am writing my own
will" (62). The after-image of the self is reduced to the grapheme of
the cursive letter "I" and imagined as occupying the space between the
flame of a nuclear blast and the shadow of human remains "photographed"
on concrete in Japan.
     Hiroshima, Walden Pond, Hitler and the Dead Kennedy are invoked in
the book's concluding poems, ending, or almost ending, on a joke in the
penultimate poem, telling an anecdote of a German postmaster refusing to
rescind a new postage stamp where the image of Hitler is 'seen' by the
German people in the tiny picture of an oak tree. As Alain Badiou
reminds us, "the reality of the inimitable is constant imitation, and by
dint of seeing Hitlers everywhere we forget that he is dead, and that
what is happening before our eyes is the creation of new singularities
of Evil" (64). The concluding poem repeats twice the denial of mockery,
"Love is not mocked, whatever use / you put to it. Words are also not
mocked" (66), then negates this denial in the closing lines: "The dark
forest / of words lets some light from / its branches. Mocking them, /
the deep leaves / That time leaves us / Words, loves" (66). Life is a
bad joke in Language, a mockery of the love of language that is
poetry.
     The concluding poem of Jonas's Exercises for Ear illustrates the
mutual sphere of influence and actual contact between Spicer and Jonas,
and it might be added that, according to the former poet's biographers,
Spicer appears in one of the first, or "the very first of O'Hara's
celebrated 'I-do-this, I-do-that' poems": "Jack, Earl and Someone
drift / guiltily in. 'I knew they were gay / the minute I laid eyes on
them!' screams John. / How ashamed they are of us! we hope" (Ellingham
and Killian 64). Jonas's book ends with a joke at the expense of
'straight' couples: "(Jack): / strange abt women / when they discover
you / on to their secret; they never / trust you / again   alone / w/
their husbands" (100). The drag queen whose reported speech in CXXIII
climaxes with the one explicit scatological reference in Jonas's book is
identified by the initial "j" ("give 'j' couple black beauties / & her
poetry comes spillin' out / all over the place"), and though the initial
might stand for John Wieners or Joe Dunn or Jonas him/herself or anyone,
for that matter, remembering that in 1959 Spicer edited a literary
magazine in San Francisco with Fran Herndon called "J" named after both
Spicer and Spicer's lover, Jim Alexander, as well as Fran Herndon's son,
Jay, in addition to which Fran's husband was also named Jim (Ellingham
and Killian 164-5), it is tempting to associate one possible source for
Jack's joke quoted by Jonas with the gender-slippage hilariously
underscored in CXXIII:

		'yeah, honey-all-them-lames
	out-on-north-beach-when-
	     its-cool-go-lookin'-in-Rexal's-under-m&m-
		candies-for-their-stash-but-
	baby-some-queen-&-her-ditty-bop-
		done-come-in-&-
			bought-out-all-them-
		     m&m-candies-"she-it"  ' (78).

If Spicer's Language closes by pressing apart the word poet, "Being
a /poet/ a / disyllable in a world of monosyllables / Awakened by the
distance between the /o/ and the /e/ / The earth quakes" (66), which
concentration on the word itself contrasts sharply with O'Hara's
grandiloquent and rhetorical image of the poet in "For James Dean,"
"Welcome me, if you will, / as the ambassador of a hatred / who knows
its cause" (41), Jonas presses apart the word "shit" and engraves its
common colloquial, emphatic (country) pronunciation into a complex
disyllable proposing gender as crossing or superimposing of "she" and
"it" in which there is no "he," no "him," no "his," tantamount to no
"man," no "father," no "law". In one split word, we find ourselves
soiled with the thought of liberation in the experience of worthlessness
apropos Artaud: "'Dear Friends, What you took to be my works were only
my waste matter'" (qtd. in Derrida 229). Here, at least, for Jonas,
neither man nor culture exist. For the reader who suffocates among the
manifold inscriptions of masculinist dictates and controls in
traditional, authoritative, patriarchal poetry, CXXIII might be said to
end with a  happy play on pronouns. "The theater of cruelty is to be
born by separating death from birth and by erasing the name of
man" (Derrida 293).
     By appealing to the thesis of the internal colony, and by
suggesting that the category of holocaust literature be extended to
include poets like Jack Spicer and Stephen Jonas, I am proposing a view
of postwar American poetry that might borrow the title from the English
translation of Tadeusz Borowski's This Way for the Gas, Ladies and
Gentlemen. After all, the title page of  Exercises for Ear reads: "being
a / Primer for the Beginner / in the / American Idiom / by STEPHEN
JONAS / Gentleman." Spicer's biographers detect the gallows humor behind
the poet's signature "in a huge muddy scrawl of maroon" on the cover of
the first edition of Language, published shortly after poet had been
fired from his part-time research position, and only source of support,
at the Berkeley campus of the University of California:  "With what
mixture of bitterness and self-loathing did Spicer arrange with Graham
Mackintosh to feature the cover of Language (July-September 1951) on the
first edition jacket of his own book with the same name. In this issue
of the journal Language, Spicer's only professional publication had
appeared while he was still studying at Minnesota" (Ellingham and
Killian 290-1). Spicer's design for the cover of this 66-page volume,
published less than two months before his fatal collapse into coma, can
be viewed both as an act of self-mutilation aimed at defiling his first
and only assertion of professional identity, and the primitive, manual
energy of the scrawled title and signature itself as an uncanny
premonition of an intensifying boundary condition between the practice
of poetry as lived environment and laboratory research paradigms in the
contemporary American academy.
     Deleuze and Guattari point to the way that "any number of 'ghetto
languages' set American English in variation" and further, that
"American English could not have constituted itself without this
linguistic labor of the minorities" (102-3). Reminding us that "[t]he
notion of minority is very complex, with musical, literary, linguistic,
as well as juridical and political, references," they write: "Minor
authors are foreigners in their own tongue. If they are bastards, if
they experience themselves as bastards, it is due not to a mixing or
intermingling of languages but rather to a subtraction and variation of
their own language by stretching tensors through it" (105). The line in
the fourth poem of the "Phonemics" section in Language, "None of you
bastards / Knows how Charlie Parker died" (52) can be cited as evident
identification with the auto-destruction of the pathbreaking
saxophonist, and that it is followed by "And / dances now in some brief
kingdom," a clear allusion to the "mid-kingdom" between musical
instrument and corpse of a colony "quick with flies" in Hart Crane's
"Black Tambourine," only reinforces this identification with the
colonized other. But this otherness, in the case of minoritarian social
identity in the internal colony, cannot be understood without
continually problematizing sexual and gender, racial and ethnic, class
and economic differences. The labor of locating the lines of force in an
imperial culture and situating within the "civilizing" operation of its
institutions a policy of containment, if not extermination, of its
marginal elements, is one of the urgent tasks for contemporary
criticism.

First, Mark Wallace, yes, of course.  I mean the content of  Bukowski's

poems was understood I thought.  But talking about who reads  him,
and when they read him, and where they may go after reading him was
really the issue.


Should he have written what he wrote?  Yes, just as everyone  should
write what they write, despite all of the PC mesh-netting around the
big old bird cage we seem to be flying around in.


It's SO DIFFICULT to write or talk about Bukowski for the very fact
that he wrote as he wrote about women and everyone acts like he
was a BAD MAN for doing so.  Writing poems does not, canNOT
make you terrible, it's soldiers invading nations while everyone's in
bed asleep we need to reserve for that finger pointing.

But by the way, all of his poems were not about women.  And by
the way being a gay man I cannot say for sure I'm in my element
here but, hey, the guy liked to eat pussy and he wrote about eating
pussy.  Big FRIGGON deal!  And some women apparently LIKED
the way he ate pussy because Charles Bukowski ate a lot of pussy
in his day.  Am I an asshole for saying this? People like sex, people
NEED sex, sex is great, sex is fantastic!  You KNOW you like it,
you KNOW you want it!  And Charles Bukowski knew about you
liking and wanting without ever having met you!

Ginsberg wrote about eating asshole.  Is it BECAUSE he wrote  about
male on male asshole eating that we can say it's okay? It's unfair  really,
is what I'm trying to say, that gay men are supported for eating ass,
when Bukowski gets hammered for eating pussy.

And, I'd very much like to read what Basinski has written on  Bukowski.

But let me say too Mark, for you to say that working class  issues
cannot take an automatic linkage is missing the mailman's point.

And you know what?  Bukowski talked about sex, and talked about
women JUST like all the men in my family working in factories, and
working in other shithole jobs talk.  Are they terrible?   No.  And
I'll tell you, the women in my family have jobs, and are FAR MORE
aware of the inequality of male/female rights than women with more
money because the women in my family bust their asses 24/7.
To think working class women are wilted lilies hiding from big old
mean Mr. Bukowski is just silly.  My grandmother would have  busted
him over the head with a frying pan if she had finally heard  enough!

The people who have always had the most fear around Bukowski
are upper middle class folks.  He's a scary guy to people who  are
not used to hearing someone speak in a frank manner, that is,
with few manners.  Where does that lack of manners come from?
Well, I'd say it comes from getting shit on from above all your life
and equating manners with money and needing to take the little
bit of fucking power you can grab which is speaking your  mind.
That was Bukowski, taking power, otherwise we wouldn't be
spending so much goddamned time talking about him.  He took
from the world and said IT'S MINE, I CAN DO THIS, FUCK YOU!
And he openly defied you to say that he couldn't!  That's really
quite remarkable I think!

Marcus, okay, thanks for the Jonathan Williams excerpt.  But, if  you
look a tiny bit closer at what I was writing, I was writing about the
Outsider Art which is IN HIS HOME BY OTHER PEOPLE.  I was not
at all referring to Jonathan Williams's poems.

To agree or not about art being elitist is an argument that seems  kind
of beside the point when we try to funnel in the idea that we are ALL
creative creatures, each and every human being.  Now, if you want  to
discuss the art world, the art schools, and all the other  institutions
which branch out from that original source we all possess, fine.  But  to
have a blanket statement that Art Is Elitist just doesn't work.

Which is exactly WHY I brought up the Outsider Artists in the first
place, which you decided was Jonathan Williams when really I was
talking about the artwork in his home by others.

Beautifying things is not elitist, it's as necessary as air.  And we  all
must,
no matter what class, or whatever other differences.

I haven't followed every single posting on this topic, so I'll restrict
myself to the snippet of the debate this e-mail presents.

I would agree to a certain extent with Marcus Bales that
great art, in general, is born from an elitist act as it tries to
transcend mundane expressions and arrive at a new truth.
At the same time I am with David Horton when he asks -
"if music isn't played in the concert hall, but is made
by poor and working class people in their homes, then that is not
music?"

Firstly, I fail to see why the "working class" can't engage
in elitist acts. Secondly, trying to read the word "elite" in its
conventional
sense is a conformism that won't help this debate.

Take Hungarian musican Bela Bartok for example. Bartok,
alongwith a small group of music-enthusiast friends, explored
the rural areas of Hungary and Romania gathering folk-music
that was essentially run by the working class. From this compilation
was born modern Hungarian folk which to a great extent was
classical music too.

I'll present a second example form the BAUL singers of Bengal, India.
This community, the BAULs, are far sub-altern than the "working class".
They are nomadic saintly beggers, who had a great humanitarian philosophy
of their own, carried just a mono-string instrument and went singing
and begging from one village to another. Their music was rich and their
lyrics - deeply philosophical and metaphysical poetry. Tagore absorbed
from the BAUL tradition enormously and created a new "elite" lyric
and music about a century back. This music today, called Rabindrasangeet,
which is really a musical rendering of rich verse, assumes the status of
classical
Bengali music. The BAUL tradition co-exists too. Purna Das Baul, a leading
exponent of this tradition sang on stage with Joan Baez and Bob Dylan at
Berkeley campus in the sixties.Today, in Calcutta, urban bands, equipped
with jazz instruments, perform their own version of BAUL songs.
So, while the tradition still lives, the boundaries between what we call
"working class" and "elite" are fast dissolving.

I'm sure this forum could throw in hundreds of such examples from
other cultures as well.

Succinctly put! That's exactly my point: the kind of elitism we're talking
about in art is not an economic elitism. There's no reason that the "working
class" or "the poor" can't engage in art if they do engage in art. But it's not
enough merely to say that it's art; it has actually to be art -- and that means
it must be both intended as art by the artist and perceived as art by the
audience. And _that_ means that it has to conform to the conventions of
what art is, at that time and place, at least to the extent that one can see
that where the conventions are challenged, bent, or broken, they are so
_on purpose_, and not merely from ignorance.

I may agree with what you're saying here, but I can't yet tell because I can't
tell what it is you're saying is the art: was it the folk-music itself, was it the
art of selecting this instead of that folk-music, or was it birthing modern
Hungarian folk and classical music, or was it the actual modern Hungarian
folk and/or classical music itself?

I think this again confuses the meaning of "elite". Elite as we're using it
here in this discussion doesn't mean, at least I don't use it to mean
"economically advantaged" as opposed to "working class". The economic
class of an individual may limit or not, may encourage or not, his or her
artistic ambitions, but all artistic ambitions are necessarily elitist: they are
attempts to take the ordinary and make it extraordinary, and the
extraordinary is ... (wait for it) ... elite!

I also hold that people with economic advantages have a better chance of
appreciating art because they've got anything from a little bit to a whole lot
more time to investigate, learn about, and appreciate art than one does if
one is working blue-collar paycheck-to-paycheck jobs that leave one pretty
wrung out at the end of one's shift. But that's not a comment on whether
those individuals, if they were given the time, are UNABLE to appreciate art
-- it's just that they don't have the time or the inclination in their present
circumstances. They don't have time or inclination for "working class
poetry" any more than for "high-falutin poetry". They've got no time for
poetry at all, and they don't care if the writer is working class or not.

Pity, since the number of people who know what Jonathan Williams has as
art on the walls of his home constitute -- you guessed it! -- an elite, and a
very small elite at that! So no matter what kind of art it is, your claim that it
is whatever it is can only mean that only you and a few other people can
know about it, and appreciate it. The rest of us will just have to take your
word for it -- which is about as bad-elitist as it gets, it seems to me. It is
exclusive in the bad sense in that it means that only "we few" can really
know and "you all" have got to tough out just believing.

So it seems that your point, then, was that since you know Jonathan
Williams keeps a particular kind of art in his home, and he knows, that
therefore there are no elites? That's a sort of self-destroying argument
since there is only that small elite who knows what kind of art Jonathan
Williams keeps in his home.

Even if I agree that humans are all, every one of them, creative creatures,
so what? That doesn't mean that all humans are artists, and it doesn't
mean that everything that any human being makes is a piece of art. There
is a difference between "being creative" and "making art". One may "be
creative" in teaching or engineering or marketing and it's still not art.

As it happens, I don't agree that every human being is creative. Some
people are just not creative; others are not funny; others are not smart or
good looking or athletic or or or or lack any number of other traits and
characteristics. So what? Lack of athleticism doesn't make one less human,
and neither does lack of creativity.

> But  to have a blanket statement that Art Is Elitist just doesn't work.<

I think it does work because there are far more people who have little or no
interest in experiencing art than there are people who want to experience it
-- and far far more than there are people who want to make art. Making art
is an elitist act because most people just can't do it, and even among those
who can do it not all of them get a chance to. Further, among all the people
who want to appreciate art, not all of them get a chance to, and most of
them don't get the chance even to know whether they do want to appreciate
art or not, much less be able to explain why Erik Satie is making art and
Eric Clapton is making entertainment.

Even if we could agree on what "beauty" meant, "beautifying things" is not
art. Art is not a matter of just prettying things up. Besides, what a
particularly bad argument for you to make, considering that what the
working class thinks is "beautifying things" consists largely of buying
sentimental crap at Walmart. Is that really what you're going to rest your
assertion about working class art on? Chinese knock-off imports from
Walmart?

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Howdy CA:

I appreciate the points you're making, and I'm not at
all trying to simplify the issue of Bukowski's work,
just, I think, to look at some of the complications of
the issue.

Although I myself grew up in a middle class way, many
of the people in my family prior to my father's
generation were rural working class in the south and
west, and significantly in Texas, from say about
1910-1960. Some were Christians, some were communists,
some, if you can credit it, were Christian communists;
they worked on farms or on highways or at hotel desks
and so on. They were often hotly political, but much
more reticent on the subject of sexuality, primarily I
would guess because of the influence of Christianity
on their lives. I say this not to approve of my family
background more than yours (yours sound more exciting,
frankly), but because I think we need to be careful of
suggesting that there is one sole "working class way"
of men speaking about women. I don't think that's
quite true simply because what it means to be working
class contains a number of other elements, including
what kind of work you do, where you work, cultural
background, the effects of religion, etc. Working
class Italians, Germans, Irish, Scots, Dominicans
don't all share the same perspective necessarily.

I like the point you make about working class women
hardly being the passive, wilting victims of the kind
of rough male language you're celebrating. Tricia Rose
in a book called Black Noise looks at a similar issue
in hiphop; she's skeptical about some white responses
to sexual, sexist language on the part of male
rappers, and she points out that within the world of
hiphop, there are many women musicians who are willing
to give the sometimes brutal insults right back at the
guys who have launched them. But she also goes on to
say that just because there is a response of that kind
by women within the hiphop community, that doesn't
mean that the problems caused by these types of
attitudes are sufficiently resolved; the effects of
them linger both within the hiphop community and also
beyond it, because of course the music is reaching
beyond that community.

Thus, perhaps, it's useful to remember that for every
working class woman who stands up to men and hits them
with a frying pan, there is another woman who has been
more brutalized in the same context. And for every
middle or upper class woman who turns up her nose
because Bukowski's directness offends her rareified
sensibility, there's another woman of similar
background who's found herself at the mercy of male
violence. And let me add here--crucially--that it's a
huge mistake on any of our parts to believe that male
violence against women exists primarily among the poor
or the working class. Historically, I think it's clear
that male violence against women has been an equal
opportunity employer.

Frankly, Bukowski's work doesn't deal with these
problems adequately. But when I say that, that doesn't
mean I don't think there are lots of other values to
his writing that are worth exploring and celebrating.

And as to the stuff about being a bad person, and
whether we should write about that, I'm firmly on your
side. I wish a lot more of the writers we know would
cut back on the moralizing and start recognizing that
they too aren't really such nice people, when you get
right down to it. That's actually why, on many
occasions, I'd rather read Bukowski than, say,
Agamben, who truly bores me.

Subject: Re: CA Conrad on Bukowski

First, Mark Wallace, yes, of course.  I mean the
content of  Bukowski's

poems was understood I thought.  But talking about who
reads  him,
and when they read him, and where they may go after
reading him was
really the issue.


Should he have written what he wrote?  Yes, just as
everyone  should
write what they write, despite all of the PC
mesh-netting around the
big old bird cage we seem to be flying around in.


It's SO DIFFICULT to write or talk about Bukowski for
the very fact
that he wrote as he wrote about women and everyone
acts like he
was a BAD MAN for doing so.  Writing poems does not,
canNOT
make you terrible, it's soldiers invading nations
while everyone's in
bed asleep we need to reserve for that finger
pointing.

But by the way, all of his poems were not about women.
 And by
the way being a gay man I cannot say for sure I'm in
my element
here but, hey, the guy liked to eat pussy and he wrote
about eating
pussy.  Big FRIGGON deal!  And some women apparently
LIKED
the way he ate pussy because Charles Bukowski ate a
lot of pussy
in his day.  Am I an asshole for saying this? People
like sex, people
NEED sex, sex is great, sex is fantastic!  You KNOW
you like it,
you KNOW you want it!  And Charles Bukowski knew about
you
liking and wanting without ever having met you!

Ginsberg wrote about eating asshole.  Is it BECAUSE he
wrote  about
male on male asshole eating that we can say it's okay?
It's unfair
really,
is what I'm trying to say, that gay men are supported
for eating ass,
when Bukowski gets hammered for eating pussy.

And, I'd very much like to read what Basinski has
written on  Bukowski.

But let me say too Mark, for you to say that working
class  issues
cannot take an automatic linkage is missing the
mailman's point.

And you know what?  Bukowski talked about sex, and
talked about
women JUST like all the men in my family working in
factories, and
working in other shithole jobs talk.  Are they
terrible?   No.  And
I'll tell you, the women in my family have jobs, and
are FAR MORE
aware of the inequality of male/female rights than
women with more
money because the women in my family bust their asses
24/7.
To think working class women are wilted lilies hiding
from big old
mean Mr. Bukowski is just silly.  My grandmother would
have  busted
him over the head with a frying pan if she had finally
heard  enough!

The people who have always had the most fear around
Bukowski
are upper middle class folks.  He's a scary guy to
people who  are
not used to hearing someone speak in a frank manner,
that is,
with few manners.  Where does that lack of manners
come from?
Well, I'd say it comes from getting shit on from above
all your life
and equating manners with money and needing to take
the little
bit of fucking power you can grab which is speaking
your  mind.
That was Bukowski, taking power, otherwise we wouldn't
be
spending so much goddamned time talking about him.  He
took
from the world and said IT'S MINE, I CAN DO THIS, FUCK
YOU!
And he openly defied you to say that he couldn't!
That's really
quite remarkable I think!

I'll just respond to one of your points that the others haven't emphasized
as much, specifically your use of the phrase "life of the mind".

The phrase appears 4 times, and I'd like to investigate how you use this
because I think we define it differently. It  makes its first appearance in
this quote of yours---

M:
It's not that the poor understand "all too well" the elitism, it's that they
are > not taught to value the "life of the mind" because they're so
concerned with just getting from paycheck to paycheck that the life of the
mind seems  pretty silly and affected -- bougie.

C: I don't think it's such an either/or distinction; just because some poor
people might consider certain forms of art or writing "silly and affected,"
doesn't mean that they consider the "life of the mind" silly and affected.
In fact, many poor folks I know (and even some folks with more advantageous
economic status), make it quite clear that it is specifically
what they see as certain IDIOMS, certain STYLES that claim to be 'the life
of the mind' they react against--like the fact that in certain circles any
claims of native intelligence or wonder are despised unless of course one
drops the 'proper' names or cultural references (what constitutes proper of
course varies from scene to scene, but in this I think we agree--it does
often involve an use of a specialized---or what you may call
elite--language).
I don't think this has all that much to do with the fact the poor are so
concerned getting from paycheck to paycheck; I could just as easily counter
that the "middle-class" or rich are often so concerned with investment
schemes, retirement funds, or with a "he who dies with the most toys wins"
philosophy that they have little time for the "life of the mind" or
to "stop and smell the roses" for that matter (even if such 'roses' are
strictly imaginary, artistic, like that Marianne Moore line---oh what was
it, about imaginary gardens with real toads in it). I personally won't make
that argument seriously---I'm just saying it's no less of a generalization
than yours, and ultimately I guess we just define "mind" or at least "life
of the mind" differently, insofar as I have found many people in my life who
don't have to be so addicted to books as others to be as intellectual and
stimulating to others' minds as any tenured prof. etc...


Its second appearance, here

M: Just so -- and most poor folks have not and will not internalize the
notion
> that the "life of the mind" is more valuable than a new car and a good job
> and the like, and they don't have the family or personal resources to try to
> have both "the good life" and "a good life"

C: Well, again, it depends how you define the "life of the mind" and though
I'm sympathetic to the "anti-materialist" or, better, "anti-acquisitive"
thrust to your point here, the elitist sense of what "mind" or "life of the
mind" is, is something I don't see in life---though I might see it in, say,
Ezra Pound or in some LANGUAGE poetry if not so much in Whitman or Bob
Dylan. To use another strictly literary reference, Shakespeare may straddle
in a way that he can be beloved both by elitists---who see their reflection
in him---as well as egalitarians--in a way that could probably prove both
your point and mine---i.e. I see Shakespeare as someone who put the two
viewpoints in dialogue with each other, and so often the joke is on those
'elitists' who think a highfalutin use of rhetoric and philosophy gives them
more access to 'a good life' than the 'shallow fools' that also people his
plays as a corrective to this attitude, though I know many people who read
Shakespeare differently).

But even if one comes to appreciate 'higher art,'and even if one comes to
NEED it, whether intrinsically or because one has something to prove, I
still have to ask you WHAT exactly such VALUES are that these "poor folks"
are missing out on....If you want to play the role of the didactic defender
of the lost art of reading elite art on the ground that it will make others
better, or even happier, people than they would be without it, you need to
do much more to convince me.

The third appearance of that phrase appears here

M: But what you're
> saying is that the poor are correct in their judgment that the life of the
mind
> is not worth living if the trade-off is poverty.

C: That wasn't what I intended to say, though I can understand how it came
off like that. I'm questioning your definition of "life of the mind" and
what criteria you use to determine whether someone is living it

And its 4th (and final) here--

M: if you're poor, even if
> you're very talented, you're not very likely to internalize the values of the
> life of the mind, and if you're well-off, you still probably won't, but you
may;
> and if you do, you have a better chance of survival, and even of success.

C: What are these values? And why can't someone get them by turning on the
radio and hearing "Check Out Your Mind" by Curtis Mayfield? for instance,
at least as much as sitting in a poetry class where they discuss the
"purposeful purposelessness" of the sublime?


I think I've gone on long enough.....Chris

Me, I can't hear the phrase "the life of the mind" without seeing an image
of John Goodman in the film Barton Fink as he stalks murderously through a
flaming hotel screaming "I'll show you the life of the mind!"

Or that conversation when he finally loses patience with Barton and says,
"No. _You_ listen."

Mission
Open an outlet for intelligent, refined, artistic, experimental, daring but
not confrontational writing. Professional or amateurs are on an equal foot.
The brain is a muscle to be cultivated. All writing will be accepted albeit
much work will be put in pushing the writers to the limit of their finesse,
flair, and intelligence. Being a magazine published every four months allow=
s
time to work on a piece. At the end of the year a publication will come out
containing the best (hopefully all) works in its full length (no word
limitation). This publication shall be priced according to its cost,
delivery, and tentatively some monetary reward for the authors. This
magazine hopes to foster literacy in its utmost light, making it accessible
for all to write. Were this initiative help out to regroup writers with
similar aspirations, inspire live performance and word installation, the
mother of this magazine would be only but the more pleased. So far, people
from nations all over the world including locals in China, have voiced thei=
r
interest to participate in such a venture, I can only see it bring a
powerful experience.

Christine was born in Montreal Canada. She thinks in many languages; speaks
French, English, Chinese, and, (mushy) Spanish. Born on the day women never
marry (25 November), on the sexiest possible year (69), with an IQ well
above the norm, slightly dyslexic, synesthesist, twisted, brainiac, weird o=

arts all her life, turned to making money in her 30=B9s, came to China after =
a
short stay in Vietnam, decided money was not all that necessary. Currently
pursuing her dream of becoming a famous writer. Forever grateful to Wang Le=

Thank you, Bob.

Ter

Hello Pos, Poettes & whatall:

Forwarding along this lengthy call for submissions for an acquaintance. She
just released the first issue of her new magazine here in Beijing. There is
a website, but it doesn't seem to be functional at the moment. Her contact
e-mail is listed below, but if you would like to obtain a copy of first
issue of the magazine, which was released this week, feel free to contact
either myself or Christine Bellerose, Editor-In-Chief.



Homônumos magazine
Literature Science Philosophy

Writer¹s call to submission:
Second Issue
Deadline submission: 31 May 2006
Theme: Perspective
Color: Blue

Avant-garde literature philosophy science magazine
Second issue: August 2006 (Beijing, China)
Published every four months
Annual compilation
Payment: none

Mission
Open an outlet for intelligent, refined, artistic, experimental, daring but
not confrontational writing. Professional or amateurs are on an equal foot.
The brain is a muscle to be cultivated. All writing will be accepted albeit
much work will be put in pushing the writers to the limit of their finesse,
flair, and intelligence. Being a magazine published every four months allows
time to work on a piece. At the end of the year a publication will come out
containing the best (hopefully all) works in its full length (no word
limitation). This publication shall be priced according to its cost,
delivery, and tentatively some monetary reward for the authors. This
magazine hopes to foster literacy in its utmost light, making it accessible
for all to write. Were this initiative help out to regroup writers with
similar aspirations, inspire live performance and word installation, the
mother of this magazine would be only but the more pleased. So far, people
from nations all over the world including locals in China, have voiced their
interest to participate in such a venture, I can only see it bring a
powerful experience.

³The idol of the day isSPhoenicians.²

Content
MUST BE EXPERIMENTAL. IN CONTENT OR LAYOUT. IN PROVOQUING THOUGHTS.
EXPERIMENTAL IS BY NO MEANS CONFRONTATIONAL NEITHER IS IT SENSATIONAL. THE
HIGHER SPHERES OF THOUHTS. FAR OUT. ACCUTE SENSITIVITY.

Try to work the idea and deliver it to us as a rough. Works in progress
(including scribbled notes etc) are most welcome. Finished pieces are not as
thought stirring. Concentrate on LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY SCIENCE.

Will do: beautiful literature, thought stirring, avant-garde themes,
experimental written organization, word art, possibilities and novel ideas,
sensual and sexual (let us see how far we can go with it), ground breaking
theories, thoughts, observation, discoveries, brainiac, nerdy, eccentric,
schizophrenic.

Will not do: political (avoiding censorship attention), slandering of
parties, conspiracy theory, sexually explicit, romance and heart broken
sobs, coming off drugs black cloud rambling, unauthorized reproduction, the
expatriate in China theme, journalism of mass.

-Short stories (facts, fictions)
-Poems and graphic word
-Essay (scheme and structure, manifesto, hypothesis, including draft on
project other than literature eg photography, architectureS)
-Thoughts, ideas, philosophy
-Lyrics
-Science (discoveries or hypothesis)

Homônumos magazine accepts submissions at all time.

Revenge of Google!

In what is a not too subtle dig at Bush's subpoena of their search records,
Google is getting their own nasty dig at 'W' before the gag orders go into
effect.


I don't know how long this will work, but go to

It's called a "google bomb" and has something to do with a large number of
websites intentionally linking themselves to the site in question via the
offending word. Hilarious, but has nothing to do with Google and everything
to do with a conscious grassroots movement. If you put "failure" in the
google box and press "I Feel Lucky" you'll get the official White House Sit=

Same method, but type in "Failure,' then "I'm Feeling Lucky."
Interesting result.

Pardon my English. A nice discussion. I can=B9t help but ponder while reading
Marcus and CA =8B =20

1. Dante, writing =B3Comedy=B2 in Italian not Latin (a language of the then
working class) Dostoevsky writing in Russian rather than French (the then
working class language of Russia), can they be identified as  efforts to
attain an elite status for the =B3working class language=B2 ?  Even if the basi=
c
motif of the said authors were just to reach common people (temporal),
considering them as cogs in the whole process of evolution of a certain
language, can=B9t we say it was ultimately to challenge the elite and /or
subsequently reach an elite status itself ? Let=B9s say, the process is
continuous,  and a new working class language substitutes the older one
which has evolved to an elite status.
2. may be I am a moron, but can=B9t help but wonder =8B who actually decides
what is art and what is not ? I am no fan of Bill Collins, but this Bill
Bashing, isn=B9t it somehow related to putting a stamp saying =B3Elite=B2 on our
personal scales ? Didn=B9t a Bukowski or a Bill Collins ever categorized /
judged the art of others,  (say Bukowski judging the so called elite arts o=
r
Collins Judging  Language Poetry), be it in private be in public =8B I was
just wondering what they may /would / could say. isn=B9t is natural for all
beings to exert /try to exert their supremacy and in that sense aren=B9t we
all elites / wannabe elites ?

re: Marcus and aryanil=B9s post :  when referring  to the part about BAULs-
marcus says =B3I think this again confuses the meaning of "elite". Elite as
we're using it=20
here in this discussion doesn't mean, at least I don't use it to mean
"economically advantaged" as opposed to "working class". The economic
class of an individual may limit or not, may encourage or not, his or her
artistic ambitions, but all artistic ambitions are necessarily elitist: the=
y
are=20
attempts to take the ordinary and make it extraordinary, and the
extraordinary is ... (wait for it) ... elite! =B3

I guess, there has been a miscommunication. I do not think BAULs can be
considered as working class or Economically disadvantaged. They are,
basically people in search of spiritual happiness as well as searching  the
juice of life through poetry and songs resonating around many aspects of
life including humanity, love (in all its dimensions), philosophy. These
guys even come from well to do families and begging is their profession jus=
t
because begging makes them smaller in others=B9 eyes, in turn making become
humble, down to earth sacrificing the last trace of Ego. I think what
Aryanil was trying to point out was that the songs they wrote / sang were
always targeted for the working class, (peasants mostly) even illiterates,
teaching them to better their ways of life in the absence of material
pleasures (that, many in India lack involuntarily) teaching them about love
and harmony, even going deeply philosophical in =B3down to earth=B2 language.
The Bauls were not considered worth listening to by the so called elites,
until Tagore, rediscovered them.

Please continue, got a lot to learn

We are speaking in broad generalities here, so I agree that there are lots of
exceptions on both sides. Community and local theaters across the country
are largely composed of "working class" people, for example. But looking at
the funding problems and the numbers of butts in the seats at those
theaters we cannot conclude other than that the working class is staying
away from the theater in droves.

Not "despised", I think, but certainly under-rated. On the other hand, in
certain circles any claims of value or significance are ... um ... under-rated
if one _does_ make allusions to art made before Elvis Presley arrived on
the scene, or in other media, for that matter.

And I'd agree -- those who pursue the life of the mind are few. Even the
tens of thousands to which you refer are few compared with the hundreds
of millions of people in the US. But that only makes it look as if you're tired
of arguing your side and decided to dabble in arguing mine for a bit. The
people who pursue the life of the mind are an elite irrespective of the social
class in which they were raised.

Not anywhere? Not in the academy, not online in these discussion groups,
not in libraries or community theaters or small presses? Not anywhere?

I'm making no arguments about whether people will be better or happier
through any kind of art at all. Frequently engagement with art makes one
less happy, though perhaps the notion of what makes people "better
people" would be more congenial ground. One may be a better person than
before without being a happier one, and a happier one without being a
better one, through art or by any number of other means.

I'm arguing that people will make better art if they are intimate with the
ways that art has been made in the past -- not merely that they've heard of
Tennyson, but that they've read him, for example.

It has nothing to do with the amount of money that someone makes or what
kind of car they drive or house they live in, if that's what you're asking. I do
not say that "working class" people are incapable of living the life of the
mind, only that the working class culture in the US is for the most part
denigrative of the life of the mind. There are many and notable exceptions -
- far too many mothers and fathers have drudged through horrible jobs to
ensure that their kids graduated college and had thereby a better shot, if
they wanted it, at the life of the mind. Not that college is necessary to the
life of the mind! By no means -- but I think we can at least agree that one
has a better chance of understanding what that life is and internalizing its
values and embarking on it if one has the time and money to engage it at a
relatively young age.

My argument is that it almost doesn't matter how we agree to define "the
life of the mind" -- that whatever definition we eventually agree on, I think
you'll have to agree, too, that those who pursue such a life are an elite.

Well, of course, someone can. But those someones are even MORE of an
elite than those who sit in poetry classes -- sort of like the argument that
you could infer the Pythagorean theorem from innumerable examples of it
around you, but most people have to be taught it. There are few
Pythagorases -- far fewer than can understand the ideas they put forward.
So your argument that it CAN happen that "someone" CAN learn a good
deal just by looking and listening results in my claim that those people
constitute the very sort of elite you seem to be trying to argue against by
using them as an example.

As for Ms Croggon's movie reference to resorts to violence to demonstrate
something about the life of the mind, I refer you all to Archimedes's death.

Read my last post, particularly the part about BAULs... I am afraid it looks
very unclear due to a number of typos. What I wanted to say--

BAULs are poor by option. Many of these guys were born in well to do
families, but they left materialistic pleasures and their rich lives behind
and embraced the so called poverty, even to the extent of begging,  thus
decapitating  their Egos.

Hope, this clears

In case you might be interested, a poet who describes himself as "working class" even though he teaches at Dartmouth College has just written an excellent book on poetry and class called: The Stamp of Class.  It's published by a university press, although I forget which one.

well, I'm trying to hint at many facets of reality here. Firstly, the fact
that this folk was practised, appreciated and propagated among peasants
as "art"; was valued as art too; "working class" art that was high quality
and original, in other words "elite", but like it invariably happens with
working class art, rarely gets a chance to reach beyond the "Penny Lane"s.
Secondly, what Bartok compiled was indeed folk-music but had an
unmistakable classicism to it (apart from the touch of contemporary
Hungarian life) and finally went on to replace the so-called traditional
(and "foreign") elitist Hungarian classical music. Bartok's work could
also be looked at from many other angles. Some say, his, is a rare example
of compiled songs that changed the musical tradition of a race.

May I ask here, then why did the term "working class" come up in this
discussion as something opposed to "elite" ? Is it really possible to
estrange economical nuances from these terms ? How do you see the growth of
"opera" as an elitist art form in the western hemisphere ? Is it possible
to think of opera-art without the dandy suites, expensive monocles, Belgian
jewellery and French perfume ?  Many different forms of musical narratives
existed all over Europe, Asia and Africa for centuries. A lot of them were
structurally, formally, content-wise very similar to the "Opera". These
were indeed perceived, entertained and appreciated as "art", but by common
folks including gypsies and other nomadic tribes. Why is it that these were
never considered "elite" ? Because they lacked richness and originality ?
Or was it because they were not appreciated by the "dandy suites" ?

I would, like Marcus, certainly want to see the word "elite" be defined as
" attempts to take the ordinary and make it extraordinary"; however, (and
unfortunately) that's not how it is perceived in all quarters. Else no one
bring up "working class" as an opposed notion.

elite: a group or class of persons enjoying a superior social or =
economic status.

elitist: one who believes in rule (or governance) by an elite group

In the narrowest sense of status, one could hardly view Bukowski ,the =
man, as having "enjoyed" a superior position either socially or =
economically, the man himself said:

"so caught between my father and the bums
I had no place to go
and I went there fast and slow.
never voted Republican
never voted."

In the broadest sense of group, one might easily view Bukowski, the =
poet, as one who believed exactly the opposite regarding the governing =
(making the rules/decisions to publish the work of another) of the =
poetic process. =20

For reference, read his Aftermath of a Lengthy Rejection Slip to get a =
sense of the writer/poet's views regarding the rule makers. =20

Since I omitted both the author's name and the publisher's of The Stamp of Class, I will supply the author's name, at least.  His name is Gary Lenhart,  I hope this infomation helps someone find and read this marvelous book.

as a vehicle for ethics--not in sense of proscribing moral virtue, but as a
mode of experience in which acuteness of perception can model both compassion
and sharp critique. Chernoff is an alchemically subtle reader of human
economies." Chernoff is the author of six collections of fiction and seven
books of poetry. She chairs the Creative Writing Department at San Francisco
State and co-edits New American Writing . Chernoff lives in Mill Valley.


Barbara Jane Reyes is the author of poeta en san francisco ( Tinfish Press,
2005), for which she received the Academy of American Poets James Laughlin
Award. Juliana Spahr calls the book: “a multilingual litany that forcefully
articulates what it means to be living as a woman in a nation of veterans,
virgins, and dark angels.” Reyes was born in Manila, Philippines, raised in
the Bay Area, and schooled at UC Berkeley and SF State . Her first book,
Gravities of Center, was published by Arkipelago Books (2003). She lives in
Oakland.

NOT EVEN DOGS
Poems by Ernesto Priego

Meritage Press is pleased to announce the release of NOT EVEN DOGS by Mexica=
n=20
poet Ernesto Priego.  This book is not only Priego's debut poetry collection=
=20
but also the first single-author hay(na)ku poetry book.

The hay(na)ku is a "diasporic" poetic form inaugurated on June 12, 2003 by=20
Eileen R. Tabios.  The form swiftly became popular and, in 2005, THE FIRST=20
HAY(NA)KU ANTHOLOGY (http://www.meritagepress.com/haynaku.htm) was published=
=20
featuring 38 poets around the world, including its coeditors Mark Young (New=
=20
Zealand) and Jean Vengua (United States).  That first anthology may be the s=
wiftest=20
anthology release following a poetic form's invention, with a second antholo=
gy=20
in the works.

Advance Praise for NOT EVEN DOGS:

[Ernesto Priego] bares & shares himself more than any other contemporary=20
poets I know. Cuts pieces out of himself & then examines them with us. & he=20=
has=20
found the perfect vehicle for it, the hay(na)ku, known in Mexico as the jain=
ak=FA=20
because his use of it has made it part of the local language even though he=20
mainly writes in English. He has grown into it, made it his own, & now it gr=
ows=20
with him. The first thing I wrote down in my preparatory notes for this piec=
e=20
was "adopt, adapt, adept". // The hay(na)ku is still a young form, but with=20
Singers such as Ernesto Priego working their magic with it, it will have peo=
ple=20
listening for a very long time.
--from the Foreword by Mark Young

The weirdly christened, pun-intended brainchild of that Thomas Alva Edison o=
f=20
contemporary poetry, Eileen Tabios, the jainak=FA (aka hay(na)ku) becomes tr=
uly=20
global in NOT EVEN DOGS, and Ernesto Priego may rightfully claim to have=20
elevated it to an art form.
--Eric Gamalinda, author of ZERO GRAVITY and AMIGO WARFARE=20

*****

Praise For Ernesto Priego's Poems:

I find so many of Ernesto's poems breathtaking, and I've never used that=20
phrase before but it fits.  I breathe in deep for the "AH!" awe of awesome p=
oetry=20
when you catch it in the act-of becoming, becoming a part of this person,=20
here, right now, you, in the reading.
--Lorna Dee Cervantes, author of DRIVE: THE FIRST QUARTET

"These are delicate, spare lyrics of love, loss, and introspection."
-K. Silem Mohammad, author of A THOUSAND DEVILS and DEER HEAD NATION

Ernesto Priego's poems magnify minutiae. When each poem closes in on dust,=20
colour, emotions, flesh-its aches and pains, every word must tremble on the=20=
rim=20

Dodie Bellamy's Prose Workshop

This summer I will be leading a prose workshop, which will meet 11
Monday evenings, from 7 to 10 p.m. The dates: June 5 through August
28 (no class June 19 and July 3). Cost: $350, with a $100 deposit due
by May 31.

By prose I mean fiction, nonfiction, prose poetry, cross-genre (and
cross-gender) writing including (but not exclusively) anything edgy
or experimental. It's a good place to present work that feels too
risky or sexy or queer for academic workshops. The workshops are
totally open-ended. Five people present a week, scheduling that the
week ahead. Usually people bring in something 5 pages or less (copies
for everybody) and we critique it that week. Longer pieces are also
okay, but they need to be handed out a week ahead of time for people
to read. Each student typically gets a half an hour each time we
critique. The classes are limited to 9 students. Lots and lots of
personal attention. They take place in my South of Market apartment,
which comes complete with snacks and two cats.

Pink Steam, my collection of fiction, memoir, and memoiresque essays,
was published in 2005 by San Francisco's Suspect Thoughts Press. My
vampire novel, The Letters of Mina Harker was reprinted by University
of Wisconsin Press, also in 2005. Academonia, a book of esays, is
forthcoming.  I'm the author of 3 other books and I teach creative
writing at SF State and in the MFA program at Antioch Los Angeles.
I've also taught at CalArts, Naropa summer session, Mills, USF, UC
Santa Cruz, and the SF Art Institute. I'm the winner of the Bay
Guardian Goldie Award for Literature and the Firecracker Alternative
Book Award for Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about work samples, etc. Or--if
you know anybody who might be interested, please pass this email
along to them. If you're interested do contact me promptly.
Preference give to those not currently enrolled in a grad writing
program.

I just had the distinct comic pleasure of reading the excerpts from these
Bukowski letters and thinking (imagining) "CB" was actually a very young
Charles Bernstein and assumed the writer's "pissedness" was at the original
root of Charles' future tracts against a poetry or language as that which
absorbs! It seems way too wet down here to be either sustainable or much
tolerable. And time for a way out into some other strategies.

But clearly - and amusedly -  I found myself wrong - and Buk clearly lived
on - a variation on these letters, it seems.

Oooh, that's an interesting idea. Reimagine "World on Fire" as though it
were written by Bukowski.

Dear Sabyasachi:
you say, "I am no fan of Bill Collins, but this Bill
Bashing, isn=B9t it  somehow related to putting a stamp saying =B3Elite=B2 o=
n our
personal scales  ?"
=20
Well, if we can say we HATE apple sauce, and I mean really HATE IT
then is that "Elite"?  But I also said it was his TEN PAGES in the  antholog=
y
that got me all crazy.  C'mon!  TEN PAGES!  AH!  Call  me whatever name
you want, but TEN PAGES from the man whose introductions have begun
"poetry should not be difficult to read" just makes me nothing but  angry.
TEN PAGES says, "Hey, THIS GUY REALLY COUNTS Oxford!  Yeah,
Olson's OKAY, but, THIS GUY COLLINS IS SUPER DUPER!"  Bullshit!
=20
TEN PAGES with so many genius poets who have written!  Poets who
really GAVE A DAMN about the challenges that faced them with making
it all new, again.  You know what, fuck Billy Collins!  I'm not  making any
apologies or excuses, it's just simply that.  If he JUST WROTE his  poems
and sold his millions of books and was HAPPY ABOUT THAT then that
would be fine.  But the fucker has been making a point of TELLING  THE
WORLD THAT POETRY should be his touch me tenderly greeting card.
Saying that the momentum gained from generations of American poets
is silly is so hard it hurts it hurts, if HATING him for  that makes me=20
"Elite" then fry me to a crispy Elite char.
=20
I'd like to take Billy Collins back to Jack Spicer at the bar, see who  gets
to eat who first!  But you never know, maybe Jack would find Billy  kind
of hot.  But probably not.
=20
In fact I want to write a play with a very long scene where I send  men
back to be sacrificial slaves for Jack Spicer's sexual needs.  This  scene
as exorcism, as resurrection, any takers?  Raise your hands, don't be=20
so damned shy.
=20
Mark Wallace:
First, glad you shared so much.  That was quite a sharing!
=20
You know what though, every time THIS part of the Bukowski  conversation
comes up the word "violence" gets tossed in.  And I know you were  not
saying that he was violent, but...
=20
...but the word always gets tossed in.  You know?  It's like  leading the
witness of some such shit.  The idea of violence against women has  no
place in a discussion about Bukowski because it's wrong.  His drive  for
sex, for women, and his big mouth have nothing to do with such  things.
He has never written about violence on women, rape, or any such thing
as being good, ever.  He's never, ever, once, not once, said such a  thing.
And while you DIDN'T say that he did, you did use the word "violence"
which always comes up, and I feel it's important to clarify these  things.
=20
Class issues are bigger and hairier than ever.  Not tooting my own  horn
here so much as using a personal example:  I'm in a queer working  class
anthology just out called EVERYTHING I HAVE IS BLUE (Suspect
Thoughts Press).  It's the FIRST of its kind.  And I'll tell you  right now,
the good press and support it's getting is from the heterosexual left  and
the heterosexual labor groups the most, it seems.  Queers don't like  to
talk about it with me.  They think it's a stupid idea for an  anthology.
=20
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY, by the way, when working class queers who=20
worked for Cracker Barrel Restaurants were fired BECAUSE they were
queer (I'm NOT making this up, look it up, and it WAS and STILL IS
very legal to do this), the queer press tuned it out.  It was  outrageous
HOW ignored it was.  And why was it ignored?  Because the  fancy
queers who took over the queer "community" have been shuffling as
far away from such economically disadvantaged folks in the  "community"
every since Stonewall.  And trust me when I say that Stonewall  was
very much a REVOLT made by the most disenfranchised, the poor,
the drag queens, the butch lesbians.  All the little young  Republican
fags scurried out the back door.  People got their heads kicked  in
that night, and you know what, they still are getting them kicked in! =20
Those picketing queers outside Cracker Barrel got hit with baseball=20
bats and such.
=20
What's scary is WHAT is scary.  Economics/class, it's a  battleground
each and every single person has inside.  And folks WOULD MUCH
RATHER discuss gender politics, race, sexism, rather than look at
the class issues which REALLY ARE at the foundation of all the
other issues folks would rather discuss.  Bukowski was  dangerous.
=20
I know that sounds DRAMATIC of me to say that, but dammit he
really fucking WAS and apparently STILL IS dangerous.  He pushes
the great big buttons.  He pushes all of the buttons on the panel  in
some poems, for some people.
=20
But I'll tell you this while I'm being DRAMATIC, that Bukowski was
a big help for a young kid poet like I was when I discovered him
because he gave me a sense of my underclass as not being so bad.
In fact, better than that, that I could be COOL TOO!  You know?
Why not, poor, delinquent big mouth big fag?  Yeah!
=20
A combination of Punk Rock and Bukowski gave me a healthy
attitude about the world.  (in fact Punk Rock and Bukowski can
lead you to Buddha, to be vegetarian, to giving a shit about every
life you touch and get touched by.)  Bukowski is EXACTLY what=20
every kid poet NEEDS in some important ways, to get that=20
SHAKE in the limbs, the anger, the lust, vibrating and getting=20
you down the road where the language itself soon wants to be=20
the importance.
=20
To be honest it would REALLY PISS OFF Bukowski fans (And I
mean SERIOUS Bukowski fans) to hear me talking about his
work as being something like sixth grade for poets.  But I'm  really
NOT meaning it as an insult at all.  To Bukowski I would  apologize.
Of course never to Billy Collins.  Bukowski really will set the  jet
fuel in motion for a young mind, while Billy Collins will keep you
on gummy bears for the rest of your life.  Shit, maybe I am an
Elitist jerk for saying this.  I mean for saying that about gummy=20
bears of course, because they're SO GOOD!  Especially in=20
strawberry smoothies.
=20
All I ask is, if Bukowski REALLY RATTLES YOU, gets you pissed,
just take a second and ask why, please.  It's really interesting
with all the names mentioned at the beginning of this thread, it's
Bukowski we've spent so much time on.

New on PFS Post: two collages from Italian artist & graphic designer Claudio Parentela, curated by Diana Magallon (www.artrecess.blogspot.com).

  "Claudio Parentela’s collages skirt the fine line between high art & fashion, the timeless & the trendy. He renders a new kind of portrait, imaginatively split between loosely applied black ink & artfully cropped photographs. Parentela’s women are seductresses, muses, & androgynous pixies all at once, daring us to enter a Surrealistic, immaculately stylized, glamorous world where appearances & realities may or may not coincide. The dichotomous nature of Parentela’s vision suggests a sensibility torn between grounded, everyday reality & the hyper-real realm of dream & fantasy. Erotic overtones are overt, gender distinctions blurry, everything works towards the transcendent end of presenting things as they are not. What we get from this is a feeling of pleasant disorientation, a sort of post-“Vogue” trance. This is “high fashion” taken to the next level, presented as fully realized works of post-Surrealist art."

  Also, new on Stoning the Devil (www.adamfieled.blogspot.com): Wordsworth & the Beatles, da Vinci & the Beach Boys, prose poems, 1st Fridays in Philly, Sam Flores, much, much more....

Dear Conrad,

Wow, wow wow.=20
Thanks. Frankly, I am in your shoes, even if they itch a lot :-). Anyone
saying =B3poetry should not be difficult to read=B2 is to be hated. I hate him
as much. I just took the =B3Bill Bashing=B2 as an example.

=B3A group or class of persons or a member of such a group or class, enjoying
superior intellectual, social, or economic status: =B3In addition to notions
of social equality there was much emphasis on the role of elites and of
heroes within them=B2 ( This is how Times Literary Supplement defines
=B3elite=B2). =B3=20

I was just trying to make a point (make a point ?? Not exactly, rather
ponder over a point). When we judge something=8B eg. As you are judging the
anthology in terms of the publisher=B9s decision to put the number of poems b=
y
Billy  vs significant others ( fun intended), aren=B9t we at some point or
other considering ourselves intellectually superior than those publishers ?
Somehow, does this not have even the vaguest connection with =8B an effort to
reach a decision making status, whereby we could negate those publishers=B9
decisions and in doing so aren=B9t we striving to reach a status that can be
very similar to =B3elite=B2 (Especially, when it is no more just personal
distaste, with people supporting your notion at a public place, me too). I
was just trying to figure out, whether every revolution ultimately leads to
establishing an elite status for the =B3working class=B2 and whether that is th=
e
end result of every effort towards achieving excellence.

Sorry, if I hurt your feelings. I didn=B9t mean to.

Regards

Sabyasachi
=20
Dear Sabyasachi:
you say, "I am no fan of Bill Collins, but this Bill
Bashing, isn=8Ft it  somehow related to putting a stamp saying =BDElite=85 on our
personal scales  ?"
=20
Well, if we can say we HATE apple sauce, and I mean really HATE IT
then is that "Elite"?  But I also said it was his TEN PAGES in the
anthology
that got me all crazy.  C'mon!  TEN PAGES!  AH!  Call  me whatever name
you want, but TEN PAGES from the man whose introductions have begun
"poetry should not be difficult to read" just makes me nothing but  angry.
TEN PAGES says, "Hey, THIS GUY REALLY COUNTS Oxford!  Yeah,
Olson's OKAY, but, THIS GUY COLLINS IS SUPER DUPER!"  Bullshit!
=20
TEN PAGES with so many genius poets who have written!  Poets who
really GAVE A DAMN about the challenges that faced them with making
it all new, again.  You know what, fuck Billy Collins!  I'm not  making any
apologies or excuses, it's just simply that.  If he JUST WROTE his  poems
and sold his millions of books and was HAPPY ABOUT THAT then that
would be fine.  But the fucker has been making a point of TELLING  THE
WORLD THAT POETRY should be his touch me tenderly greeting card.
Saying that the momentum gained from generations of American poets
is silly is so hard it hurts it hurts, if HATING him for  that makes me
"Elite" then fry me to a crispy Elite char.
=20
I'd like to take Billy Collins back to Jack Spicer at the bar, see who  get=
s
to eat who first!  But you never know, maybe Jack would find Billy  kind
of hot.  But probably not.
=20
In fact I want to write a play with a very long scene where I send  men
back to be sacrificial slaves for Jack Spicer's sexual needs.  This  scene
as exorcism, as resurrection, any takers?  Raise your hands, don't be
so damned shy.

Dear Sabyasachi, first and most important NO you did not hurt my  feelings.
We're having a conversation, everything's fine.  In fact, if you had  any idea
what I've been through in this life you would realize just how far you  really
would have to go to HURT my feelings.

Back to the conversation.  It's so easy for Billy Collins to be looked  upon
as this benign, sweet guy writing poems.  He's NOT.  You read his  prose
ON poetry, what he is TELLING his massive audience what NOT to read,
then you'll understand why it's time to confront him.

It's dangerous, lousy advice he gives.  It's the SAME sort of shit  that was
whispered in my ear over and over and over when I first moved to  Philadelphia
as a kid.  There was all this BUZZ about Language Poets and  BEWARE!
Hehehe!  It's so funny now.  And at the time I was and still am  someone
who WANTED TO SEE exactly what it was they were telling me was so
dangerous.  But not every young mind is like that.  Some have too  much
RESPECT for authority (wish we could break that down some more!) and
Billy (the quiet Bully) Collins waves a gentle flourish dismissing  everyone
and everything ever published by, let's say, Cid Corman for starters.

There's only so many seconds of life, only so many breaths to breathe,  and
SO MUCH OF IT wasted listening to his misguided  cheery directives.

And I want very much to point out that, in Philadelphia in those days, we
were
MOST fortunate to have Gil Ott and Chris Stroffolino.  Gil Ott was  publishing
PAPER AIR Magazine, which later turned into Singing Horse Press.  And  Gil
was right in the middle of everything DESPITE the snarls he put up with  as
he defended Charles Bernstein, defended Silliman's AMERICAN TREE,
etc., etc., (and he was SUCH A SMART GUY, seeing some smartass kid
like me who gave Silliman's anthology a glance, and he said, CONRAD,  you
need to check out Stephen Roedefer in that book.  i was hooked!)   Then we
had Chris Stroffolino, probably the VERY FIRST person to bring Alice  Notley
to Philadelphia to read.  Well, in my time at least.  Notley and  a host of
other amazing poets.  So, there was harsh elbow rubbing going  on, but there's
far more room these days in Philly for all schools of experimentation  thanks
to the likes of Temple and Penn, AND THOSE not affiliated.  I'm not
affiliated.
But am glad we're all here!  Lots to get done!

---
For all the backchannels questioning my Bukowski Is The Way To Buddha
comments made.

This is something I feel it's SAFE for me to say BECAUSE I'm queer,  and
because I've been persecuted for being queer.  To say that, all the  time I
spent POINTING MY FINGER at straight white guys as a kid for the  suffering
I went through was delayed time for me seeing me.

Does this make sense?  Bukowski's insights in the later poems were  still
his bitchy grumpy self, but he had reflected SO MUCH on who he was  and
who he was becoming (all the layers of that) that you can see how he  had
come to a higher understanding of everything around him.  Bukowski's  World
View became so much bigger BECAUSE he kept going forward with the
examination despite the conflicts coming at him for doing so.  In fact  it's
probably safe to say that those who were disagreeable with his  direction
fueled him.  He was a tenacious Soul.

BUT, does this make sense in the FACT that, while someone like me was
busy pointing the finger outside of myself, straight white guys like  Bukowski
had NO WHERE to point the finger but inside.  And Bukowski saw himself
SAW HIMSELF over and over and over and he got to work in the world inside
a strength which takes the rest of us a longer time to get to, if we get to
it.

How important to get to it, to get things done, real things, beautiful
things,

I don't mean to argue with you Conrad because I really know very little
about Billy Collins or the intro you spoke of. But in his defense I have
reason to question his intention if not the context of it -- based on this
poem he wrote:


**************
Introduction to Poetry

I ask them to take a poem
and hold it up to the light
like a color slide

or press an ear against its hive.

I say drop a mouse into a poem
and watch him probe his way out,

or walk inside the poem's room
and feel the walls for a light switch.

I want them to waterski
across the surface of a poem
waving at the author's name on the shore.

But all they want to do
is tie the poem to a chair with rope
and torture a confession out of it.

They begin beating it with a hose
to find out what it really means.


*****************


I know about this poem only because a few years back my brother, a very
bright man, emailed to say he didn't understand my work. He included this
poem in the email & said it helped him realize that he didn't need to
torture my poems to figure out what they meant, that he could just wave to
me as he skied across them. I was actually quite grateful to BC for that. &
it's helped me articulate to a few newbies the approach to [perhaps
difficult] art undaunted.



xx,
hassen

PS my 2cent op ed

elitism implies that the passage in is narrow if non-existent. direction,
perspective, information (like the above poem) in reference to deciphering
some creative modes/works makes the idea of elitism moot when discussing
art. without it, I'd venture to agree that difficult poetry IS elitist. but
the issue of elitism in Art is entirely irrelevant (sd at the risk of
voiding this entire paragraph). individual elitism is a different subject
altogether. those are the artists who put the cart (ego) before the horse
(art/craft) as it were & refuse to engage with the uh  layperson .

it's critical to share instruction, information, etc. in all social aspects
politics, class, economics. "Providing passage for others is the ultimate,
if not only, anti-elitist act," she sd, with little time to sort out the
implication or comprehensiveness of that statement. but it would support
Conrad's statement that Bukowski et al is the path to Buddha (or whatever).
as well as Billy Collins.

A Bob Dylan Symposium
University of Minnesota-Minneapolis
March 25 -27, 2007


Call for Paper and Session Proposals

In conjunction with its presentation of the=20
exhibition Bob Dylan's American Journey,=20
1956-1966, the Weisman Art Museum at the=20
University of Minnesota is organizing a major=20
symposium on Bob Dylan to take place on the=20
Minneapolis campus March 25 to 27, 2007.

U.S. Highway 61 begins at the Canadian-Minnesota=20
border, runs along Lake Superior to Duluth=20
(Dylan's birthplace), skirting close to Hibbing,=20
Minnesota, where Robert Zimmerman grew up and=20
graduated from high school. The legendary "Blues=20
Highway" runs through the Twin Cities, following=20
the Mississippi south to St. Louis, Memphis, and=20
Clarksdale, Mississippi, ending in New Orleans.=20
This symposium aims to explore Dylan's journey=20
from Minnesota to the wider nation and the world,=20
viewing Highway 61 as a route of geographic and=20
artistic odyssey and as a metaphorical space of=20
encounters, tests and tricks, fantastical=20
experiences, and re-invention.  The road connects=20
Dylan to multifarious musical, cultural, and=20
artistic histories and links other places and=20
cultures to Dylan.

The three-day symposium aims to both generate and=20
present new research and interpretations of=20
Dylan, his career, his artistic output, his=20
milieus, his influences, and his impact=20
worldwide. In particular, the organizing=20
committee seeks to explore the local and the=20
global and possible connections between the two.=20
On one hand, the symposium will examine Dylan's=20
Minnesota roots and influences from the Iron=20
Range and Minneapolis (Dylan in Minnesota;=20
Minnesota in Dylan). Alternately, we are=20
interested in the global dimensions of Dylan's=20
work, including both the singer's use of world=20
music, literature, philosophies, art, and=20
religious thought, and also his impact and=20
reception in specific scenes (musical, literary,=20
political, fashion) and cultures around the=20
world. (See reverse for possible topics.)

Proposals for papers or for entire sessions can=20
be submitted online with a deadline of November=20
1, 2006. Proposals should include a one-page=20
abstract and a one-page bio or c.v. with complete=20
contact information. Entire sessions can also be=20
proposed with a main contact person indicated and=20

Audience participation, like, dance your Phd away, etc.

Dear List,

Those of you who are fighting over this term might well be reminded that
the word 'elite' is simply the French equivalent of English 'elected',
both deriving from Latin 'eligere' = 'to pick out, to choose, to select,
to elect.'

I don't know about the rest of you, but as for me the cultural baggage
that comes with this word is way too heavy for me.  The poet, the
artist, as the chosen one?

I myself wouldn't want to have anything to do with such a notion.

Maybe that's why I have walked away from the religion of the poet.

George Thompson, from out of nowhere

The bag of elitism in part can also, though, be traced to a slant of  Alexandre Kojève's lectures in Paris in the 1930s on Hegel that could  be viewed, I understand, in their tracing of Nietzsche, Marx and  Heidegger, to the emergence at the "end of history" of an elite  -  a permanent oligarchy - a take which was brought to and propagated in  the US via Leo Strauss. This of course lead to Paul Wolfkowitz et al's  Project for the New American Century and our current spillage.  According to this interpretation (Strauss, Bloom and the bunch), Kojève  predicted the end of history in the triumph of capitalism - which as we  are reminded by Mussolini is fascism perfected. It's really just base  greed. We're all going to die and each generation in one way or another  comes up with a view to place it as the one that gets to turn out the  light. It takes the edge off. As below pointed out, we want to be "the  choosen." We're all playing "please don't wake the dragon."

As  an antidote I would prefer Emerson's elitist jag as he reveals it in  his lecture "The Poet": "We are all poets at last… Each of us is a part  of eternity and immensity, a god walking in flesh, and the wildest  fable that was ever invented, is less strange than this reality.” But  then, sure, that's pure "religion of the poet," but then the way  Emerson defines poet comes into play - which is where Nietzsche cut in.  The first is the worst and the second is the best and the last is the  one with the hairest chest.

Those of you who are fighting over this term might well be reminded that
the word 'elite' is simply the French equivalent of English 'elected',
both deriving from Latin 'eligere' = 'to pick out, to choose, to select,
to elect.'

I don't know about the rest of you, but as for me the cultural baggage
that comes with this word is way too heavy for me.  The poet, the
artist, as the chosen one?

I myself wouldn't want to have anything to do with such a notion.

Maybe that's why I have walked away from the religion of the poet.

Hello all -

I'm putting together a new journal and am looking for a printer to bid on
the project.

Can anyone recommend a good quality, reasonably priced printer that would b=
e
willing to bid on a smaller scale project?

Many thanks,

George and Sam, we needed your doses injected!

If ever you get to Philadelphia, you should make sure you make a
stop at The Lodge of Theosophy, where Blavatsky set up shop in
these parts of the world for a bit.  The elders in there are pretty  damn
close to the biggest shock to the senses you're bound to find when
confronted with people who have studied the densest formulas
available to us for explaining the mechanics of how energy bends.

At Lodge functions where certain books such as Isis Unveiled are
discussed, we have a lengthy Q&A surrounding Blavatsky's various
methods, theories (although I'm not sure SHE would call them
theories so much as Truths, hehe!  I can be such a bastard!),  and
what I call Theosophical Prejudice.  The one time I ALMOST  stumped
them from the back is when we were discussing Blavatsky's  "theory"
surrounding the "mischief" of the Transcendentalists.  She  actually
refers to them, including Emerson, as childish, as ridiculous, as
something to be utterly dismissed.  But I pointed out (for some  time,
which I'll sum up here) Emerson and Whitman encapsulate nearly
all of Blavatsky's most urgent messages about Atonement and
Universal Bodies of the Ego and how --as you point out Sam-- We
are a capital "W" We in Art, because we are creation.  Each of  us
gets TO IT so to speak in the broader sense TO the smaller sense.
Or, senses distilled.  Or, the miracle of the Transcendentalists  that
Blavatsky dismissed is the nature of Nature and how in fact We as
a capital "W" cannot be dismissed as We look at one another as
equal partners in the journey we are taking to experience creating
from our created hands.

And this is NOT some injected Christian notion so much as it is one
that follows a more Buddhist sense, especially Tibetan, where the
wisest who partner in understanding the mechanics UNDERSTAND
to this day what was lost by the wisest in Europe centuries ago
(due to Christian domination and destruction).  The mandalas  that
the Tibetan Buddhists make are not just pretty designs, they are
the actual WORKING blueprints of the hidden code of energy AS
IT IS BENDING.

My own theory here is that the Internet is our way home to that.
I know a million people will want to JUMP DOWN MY THROAT for
saying this, but, I TRULY BELIEVE that the Internet is the West's
way Home to that understanding of hidden code.

And furthermore, the Internet is what's driving us together whether
we're a thousands miles away or not.

But my original point was that Blavatsky-ites need to reconsider
the Transcendentalists.  Blavatsky was SO CONSUMED with her
studies of India that she was willing to block out something which
was CLEARLY a parallel study in the rapture of Being Here.

"We are all poets at last..." which is really what the original  thread
on Bukowski was getting to get to.

I would recommend Van Volumes Ltd. In Palmer, MA. It specializes in
short-run editions, and provides limited print on demand. Its rates are the
lowest I've seen. They've published all of my perfectbound books, so any of
you owning copies of them have an idea of Van Volumes' work. You can contact
them at 1-800-290-0462 or at www.vanvolumes.com. Ask for Russ Tate and
mention my name.

Well, I suppose we can always hope you really believe this, and that
natural selection will inevitably get rid of you, and all those who believe as
you do, since none of you can, without profound contradiction to your own
beliefs, go to doctors or dentists or do anything that takes advantage of any
of the western notions of how the world works, such as use computers or ...
oops!

Sun Ra Institute and WKCR-FM NYC present

'SUN RADIO OMNIVERSITY' - SUN RA ARRIVAL DAY CELEBRATION

32-HOUR RADIO MARATHON
MONDAY, MAY 22nd at midnight to TUESDAY, MAY 23rd, 8:20 AM
89.9 FM NYC & WWW.WKCR.ORG streaming live across the galaxies

The Sun Ra Institute and WKCR-FM are proud to announce the Sun Ra
Arrival Day Celebration, a 32-hour radio marathon featuring work of
the innovative and iconoclastic composer, bandleader, and keyboardist
Sun Ra. Each segment of the festival will focus on a specific feature
of Ra's musical legacy: Standards and Ballads, The Swing Tradition,
Solo Piano and Poetry, Late 1950's and Early Rarities, Tone Science,
Singers, and more. The Arrival Day Celebration will include exclusive
recordings from WKCR's archives as well as live special guest
interviews with Marshall Allen, Director of the Sun Ra Arkestra, and
Arkestra members of the past, present and future.

Born Herman Poole Blount in Birmingham, Alabama on May 22, 1914, he
was nicknamed Sonny from his youth. He later abandoned his birth name
and took on the name and persona of Sun Ra ("Ra" being the name of
the ancient Egyptian god of the Sun). He did not consider himself
"born"; rather, he "arrived" on the planet, entering via Birmingham.
From the '50's to the '90's Sun Ra led a large ensemble with a fluid
lineup under a variety of names: The Solar Myth Arkestra, The
Intergalactic Space Research Arkestra, and many others. Sun Ra
departed on Memorial Day - May 30, 1993.

Sun Ra's prolific achievements on Planet Earth have been widely
acclaimed and recorded in documentaries, books, and a feature film
titled "Space is The Place". He founded his record label, El Saturn
Records, in the 1950s, and proceeded to unleash nearly 200 fiercely
individualistic and extremely diverse albums on an unsuspecting and
largely unprepared public. He also recorded for a handful of major
labels, and he attained widespread notoriety from his legendary
concerts, radio, and television appearances. His interstellar
musical, poetic, linguistic, and spiritual explorations are
unparalleled in the history of modern music and culture.

With The Arkestra, Sun Ra gave astonishing performances around the
world for decades. He was always accompanied by stellar musicians in
fantastic costumes, and a joyful atmosphere of mischievous space
camaraderie was ever present. His music is most often regarded as
'Jazz', though it spans the full spectrum from Swing to Space, with
ballads, show tunes, hard- and post-bop, exoticism, funk, energy
music, and electronic hyperdrive.

WKCR SUN RA ARRIVAL DAY CELEBRATION: PRELIMINARY SCHEDULE
May 22nd, 2006 - 89.9 FM NYC & WWW.WKCR.ORG

12-5 AM Sun Ra Potpourri
 The broadcast will begin with a variety of great Sun Ra sounds to
warm up this event.

5-8 AM Sun Ra Plays Standards and Ballads
 The Daybreak Express show will feature Sun Ra's performances of
standards, ballads, and show tunes.

8-9:30 AM The Swing Tradition
 The Bird Flight slot will be an extension of the previous show, but
this time focusing on the compositions of Jelly Roll Morton, Duke
Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, and others. Little known facts:
Fletcher himself once gave up his own piano chair to Sun Ra. Sun Ra
wrote charts that Coleman Hawkins had difficulty playing. Monk was
impressed, too.

9:30 AM-Noon Solo Piano and Poetry
 Our morning Classical show will present Sun Ra's solo piano
recordings, including an exclusive performance at WKCR in July 1977.
This segment will also incorporate Sun Ra's extensive poetic works.

Noon-5PM Omniversity: Late 1950's and Early Rarities
 Phil Schaap will shine the spotlight on Sun Ra's elemental work from
the later 1950's. Following this segment, we will shift into a survey
of the very earliest recordings of Sun Ra, arranging for singers and
performing as a sideman. Phil will be joined by a panel of scholars
and band members, presenting the rarest of Sun Ra sides.

5-8 PM Tone Science
 The synthesizer and abstract works of Sun Ra. Tune in for some of
the most adventurous recordings of Sun Ra's career. This segment will
include both solo synthesizer performances as well as those with an
ensemble.

8 PM-1 AM From the Ark
 The evening segment is expected to be the highlight of the marathon.
We will play live recordings and interviews, with visits from special
guests and a focus on materials from WKCR's own "Arkives", as well as
a collection gathered by The Sun Ra Institute.  We will take some
time to honor the current living-and-breathing Sun Ra Arkestra, under
the masterful direction of Marshall Allen, and celebrate Marshall's
82nd birthday a few days early.  Stay tuned for extra features in the
works, including remote broadcast from the Sun Ra House in
Philadelphia.

1-2 AM The Singers
 This hour will give a closer look at Sun Ra's work with vocalists,
including his R&B and Doo-wop efforts.

2-5 AM Overnight Sun Ra
5-8:20 AM Daybreak Sun Ra
 Sun Ra will again be the focus of Transfigured Night and Daybreak
Express. Here is another chance Travel the Spaceways with Sun Ra and
The Arkestra.

I think Alan Sondheim's review of Jacques Roubaud's, The form of a city
changes faster, alas, than the human heart, One Hundred-Fifty Poems,
1991-1998, translated by Keith and Rosmarie Waldrop, 2006 - gets close to
'justice'. I think it is terrific. I would not sweat the Oulipo associations
- some work beautiful, some I find tedious.
What is most important to me, what comes through is the book's deep and
fresh embrace of Paris - historical and present. The forms and language
fight and/or reject the obvious - sentimental, familiar, et al. What emerges
is a hard edge lyricism (not without "sentiment"). The forms freshen the
angle and make things come up undressed and new.

I won't go on. I want to write a 'real' review of this book. It should alter
the way we look at and explore cities. It is a major work that encourages
rather than dominates. I don't think Dalkey Archive will have it in the
stands 'formally' until July 18. Hold on to your summer!!

On the heels of the list of printers coming through here (and don't
forget thomson-shore and edwards brothers in michigan, though they are
more expensive), I'm wondering if we might collectively generate a list
of distributors people know about our use (whether as library or
bookstore buyers, or as publishers, etc.)

Though committed to independent distributors such as SPD, with the
upcoming publication of "We Know You Are Watching" -- a 450 page
collection detailing the writings and exploits of the Surveillance
Camera Players (see notbored.org for more information) -- it seems like
we might have a need for more outlets for our books.

Any ideas?

Hi Joel

I don't have any ideas about distribution. Now that we can pretty much
publish our own books with professional producing values, the biggest
problems seems to be getting them into bookstores or available to readers.
I have distribution with Baker & Taylor---as policy, SPD doesn't handle
self-publishers---which makes my work available through a lot of online
sellers. But it doesn't get my work into places where people can see and
handle it and maybe even buy it. I'd like to hear any ideas anyone has about
improving distribution for our work.

if I have a .pdf of something close to the galley stage, I make about =
100
copies and circulate them as "electronic galleys" to places that review, =
to
book festivals, etc. that would ordinarily expect a book, to some =
contests,
competitions, etc., to reading series that now expect books (from this I =
get
about five reviews or readings), to friends and people I see;=20

send more to various poets, reviewers, e-zines I know online (this =
because
they are more likely to review or excerpt and link back to electronic =
format
stuff than old fashioned paper people);

I had a second book with galleys and copies distributed improperly and =
made
"pirate" paper galleys;

most publishers expect authors to distribute postcards to other authors,
friends, and people in general in places surrounding readings; big
publishers, like those owned by the Carlysle Group that the Washington =
Post
reviews almost exclusively, pay for the postcards themselves

I'm currently trying to make press releases, order forms, and "sell =
sheets"
for my books that don't have them, for mailings, like Iowa, etc. does

I'm just trying to say that

1) consider cost of galleys and postcards when designing the cover and
choosing the printer, because it can add up

2) share your gifs and layouts and templates with your authors

3) you might want to participate in the "electronic galleys" movement so
that this becomes more acceptable (it costs about $2 for galleys, and =
about
$1.50 to mail them, versus being free to $1 to produce and mail a .pdf =
on a
CD Rom)

4) publishers might help authors so that both can spend time and money =
doing
things that sell the book instead of doing basic chores

as for distributors, you might want to check Gardners for Europe and =
inbooks
for Australia

Catherine this is really good information. Thank you. I wonder if you have
a standard list of these places where you circulate "electronic galleys"
that might be shared -- or if it's specific to you, or to specific books?

Not in my opinion.
The primary one for me is that he just blurts ignorant and easy
stuff about beer and horseraces and shit.

Here's a little thought that came to me.

What do Bukowski and Billy Collins have in common?

Each has a body of work that reflects his individual sensibility and
lifestyle.  Each has broad appeal.

Neither has individual poems that stand out.

They are so different from poets who have major highs and lows in their
poetic output.  Think of Ginsberg's best as well as his worst,
Ferlinghetti. . . Buk and BC aren't that way.  Just about everything they
do is somewhere around pretty good--some better than and some less than.
But the highs aren't there.  The great individual poems that we associate
with poets.

I could be wrong.

discuss.

I have to agree wit Gwyn. I fail to see what's so
wonderful about Bukowski. Sure, he offends easily
offended folks entrenched in their middle-class,
bourgeois values, but for those who are already
questioning those values, his work seems a bit one
note, and he's relatively uninterested in language
play. Writing that you pity people who have "never
gone crazy" isn't that interesting--or provocative. To
me Gabe Gudding is much more offensive and
provocative. And smart. Or, for that matter, just
about any childhood playground rhyme:

Abraham Lincoln
Was a good old soul.
He washed his face
In a toilet bowl.
He jumped out the window
With his dick in his hand,
And said, “’Scuse me, ladies!
I’m superman.”

Or

I fucked your mama
Till she went blind.
Her breath is bad
But she sure can grind.

Or

I hate to talk about your mama;
She’s a good old soul.
She’s got a ten-ton pussy
And a rubber ass-hole.

I'd take any of these over Bukowski's beer shit.

Best,
Joseph

Well, there has been some local (to LA & the US in general) collectively =
generated thought re. forming a net-based distribution =
collective/cooperative because, while SPD is excellent in many ways, =
there is clearly a need for more plasticity (of thought at least) around =
how small press publishers might get their books into the hands of the =
people and at less cost to individual publishers and through a wider way =
of thinking 'channels' to people.

Some have been discussing a web-based forum whereby individual =
publishers might offer all our wares via one website (where each press =
might pay a _very_ nominal annual fee, just for setting up the site, =
getting the word out, etc.) & have their own page or something on the =
'mother' site--duration press provides a kind of nascent model for how =
this might potentially be configured or imagined-- & fill orders =
independently, thus circumventing the not insubstantial cut taken by =
most distributors and, in the worst case scenario--with some of the =
'bigger' dist. houses: I.e. Ingraham, etc. holding stock and eventual =
chucking or pulping of unsold inventory like some 'books as hostage' -- =
indiv. presses would fill their own orders and mail them to consumers, =
etc., keep bigger chunk of sales and effectively dismantle any need for =
real-time infrastructures like warehouse space with potentially high =
rent which then gets passed on to publishers and consumers, etc.

But this is something the imagined collective 'we' would have to invent. =


Which hasn't happened yet though has been discussed at length in various =
places and among various folks.=20

I think it is abundantly obvious that the 'we' of it all needs/must =
reconfigure and adapt to changing .. whatevers. marketplace outlets? I =
am not sure bookstores as what we are used to thinking of them -as- are =
the way to go with this- as many indies keep shutting down all around =
us. hello Ithaca Bookery, etc.=20

My 2 cents. and forgive if I'm being redundant. been off list long time =
now.

That's because in this, as in so much else, the people who believe that
literariness is ornament are simply ignorant of much of what they criticize in
Western culture. It's a simple, but telling, mis-use of the phrase "begs the
question" to mean "raises the question".

The minimalist concrete poetry site at:

has been updated with 8 pieces by K.S. Ernst.

If you require work to fit discretely within the confines of a single

CALL FOR ENTRIES. LAST DEADLINE: MAY 15th, 2006 (postmarked)
||||| FESTIVAL #11 #12
||||| RENCONTRES INTERNATIONALES PARIS/BERLIN
||||| FILM / VIDEO / MULTIMEDIA
||||| http://art-action.org/en_info.htm

     *** Please forward this information as widely as possible ***

The Call for entries 2006 is open until May 15th (postmarked). In Autumn
2006, the festival 'Rencontres internationales Paris/Berlin' will
present in Paris and Berlin an international programming focusing on
film, video and multimedia, gathering works of artists and directors
acknowledged on the international scene along with young artists and not
much distributed directors. The festival aims at presenting those works
to a broad audience, at creating circulations between different art
practices and between different audiences, as well as creating new
exchanges between artists, directors and professionals.

ALL INDIVIDUALS OR ORGANIZATIONS CAN SUBMIT ONE OR SEVERAL PROPOSALS.
THE CALL FOR ENTRIES IS OPEN TO FILM, VIDEO AND MULTIMEDIA CYCLES,
without any restriction of length or genre. All submissions are free,
without any limitation of geographic origin.

FILM AND VIDEO: * Video art / Experimental video * Experimental film *
Documentary * Fiction
MULTIMEDIA: * Installation * Net art, CDrom, DVDrom * Performance art,
concert, sound work

ALL submissions are sent by mail, enclosed with a filled-in ONLINE ENTRY
FORM, UNTIL MAY 15th, 2006 (postmarked). Entry forms and information
regarding the 'Rencontres internationales Paris/Berlin' are available on
our website http://art-action.org/en_info.htm

The 'Rencontres internationales' offer more than a simple presentation
of the works. They introduce an intercultural forum gathering various
guests from all over the world - artists and directors recognized on the
international scene along with young artists and directors who still
cannot enjoy a substantial distribution, directors from organizations
and emerging structures - testifying of the vivacity of creation and its
diffusion, but also of the artistic and cultural contexts that often are

reflects specificities and crossings of contemporary art practices, and
work out this necessary time when points of view meet and are exchanged.

denen sich manche in einer Übergangsphase befinden oder tiefgreifende
Veränderungen erleben. Die Rencontres internationales zeigen die

I was going to suggest that they are both dead, except that is unfair to
Bukowski.

    Sure, they both have wide appeal, sell a lot of books, & write "personal" poetry. What Buk has that Billy doesn't is RISK, the ineffable "something-at-stake". Buk's best poems have a "do or die" fire that BC can't touch. Buk is whiskey, BC is toothpaste, not even Crest-- certainly not "Close-Up".

Catherine and Jane



Thank you for posting.



Catherine, your suggestion of sending galleys as PDF files is a great one. I
send out a lot of books that don't get reviewed and PDF copies would leave
me---or one of my other publishers, possibly--- more books to sell or the
option of ordering a smaller print run.



Jane, I'd like to hear more about the plans for electronic distribution that
are taking place. Some of my friends are

talking about a similar approach. Any ideas we can consider would be very
welcome.



Thanks and Best,

                                             That white car has been sitting there for quite some time. Swinging a  sledge hammer over my head, the bright chock of weight splitting stone  poofs up from the front porch. I went back to Ohio. That day we left  cinderblock rubble in front of the house; they say the English have bad  teeth. Is any of this true? You'd hate to leave it just lying there.  Eating must be very hard for them, all that porous stone in riptide  angles. That white car just sitting there for quite some time is our  neighbors; I can see it from this window, but that means I'm denied  it's use. When Caleb apologizes spontaneously to her, he becomes a man,  and the little boy with a pinched face lashing and spitting at  everything he sees is gone. He'll be back, but now we know her shadow.
   Darker rides, darker rides, and the little boy

  to look for America. Your bad teeth
  deny you the sustenence and the sentience
  to bleach lopped halls with loops from
  my origination, my divinity, and the sanguine.
  That black car that's never been on this block
  is our use; we smashed the front steps
  and dragged them off behind the trees

=20
This is the answer I agree with the most, thanks Pierre.  Yeah yeah  yeah,
everyone wants to prove how cool they are by saying how totally empty
and useless the long writing life of Bukowski was.  Well you're  wrong.
=20
And to say that his shock value was unimportant is to not have the  eyes
to see when he said, where he said, what he said.  And the best  thing
is that his shock value was for the most part Bukowski being himself.
=20
And the fact that that shock value was little more than the man being
himself is what needs to be examined.  The class structure which  has
framed literature is what the conversation COULD be about.  To  say
that this is not an interesting subject, or to say that this is not a  worth=
y
subject is to say you really don't WANT to have the conversation.
=20
It's much like the idea that if you do NOT have a MA or MFA that you
really should just shut your mouth.  I've heard this A LOT since I do  not
have formal degrees.  In fact I've heard this second hand about ME  from
someone on this list as a matter of fact.  Which is fine, especially  if
this person doesn't have the courage to say so to my face in person.
=20
Class structure is also framed of course in education.  In fact it's  there
where the embankment is made and kept to maintain order from
the Bukowskis and other riff raff.  It's like the time I was at a  certain
university moderating a panel of poets and I asked those poets what
they thought and felt about MA and MFA degrees in writing.  Well,  you
couldn't believe the "controversy" such a question caused.  In fact  one
person in the audience ACTUALLY told me that I had "no right to ask
such a question in a university!"  What!?  Get the FUCK out of  here!
=20
And by the way, the question's answers were great!  A good mix,  a
healthy mix of answers all around.  And isn't that really what  university
time is for, to question, everything?  Guess not, for everyone.   Suckers!
=20
And enough already with the fucking back channeled responses telling
me about Bukowski and women!  I've already covered how I feel  about
that and I'm not sure you read what I already covered here on that.
Sorry if there are men who like to eat pussy, okay!?  Is that what  you
want from me?  An apology for Bukowski eating pussy?   Geesh!  He's
dead, okay?  All the pussy of the world is SAFE from his eating  now!
=20
It's easier though to dismiss Bukowski, isn't it?  Because if we  don't
dismiss him, then we might actually have to have a discussion about
what he really meant.  To reduce him to his beer and his bar talk  is
to miss the point on purpose, in my opinion.  So have it your  way,
dismiss him, miss the point, on purpose.

Dear Craig,

I do not care one flying poop whether anybody on this list thinks I am
cool. That was not my purpose in responding as I did regarding Bukowski
and Collins.

As the owner of a pussy, I do rather like to have it eaten. It has been my
experience that when whoever is doing the eating is drunk, the quality of
the eating, from the POV of the eat-ee, declines considerably. Your
mileage may vary.

Shock value is great. Indeed, had Billy Collins even a fraction of
Bukowski's shock value, he mightn't be so deadly boring.

I also don't give a flying poop whether somebody has a graduate, or any,
degree. My life's sweet companion has no college degree at all. I have an
MFA. Was it fun to get? Hell yes. My partners in crime included Heather
Fuller, Ethan Fugate, Susan Landers, Betsy Andrews, Carol Mirakove,
Allison Cobb, Jennifer Coleman, and many others. Is the degree,
academic-advancement-wise, as useless as tits on a boar hog? Pretty much.

I just don't like the creative output of either Buk or Collins. I do not
like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-am. Is it not possible
NOT to like Bukowski without being some kind of goddamn anti-worker
counterrevolutionary?

It's curious how easy many people find it to dismiss,
say, the work of Elizabeth Bishop, and yet so
difficult to accept those who don't find Bukowski
interesting. Instead of speaking generally, why don't

Marcus, how is that you can't believe all things are possible at  once?  Is
this
really such a foreign idea to you?

In India it seems they maintain remnants of all their past.  In the  middle of
one of the fastest growing economies of "western" technologies they  also
have hijras, a community of men who are eunuchs of self-inflicted  wounds,
and these men are left over from the times of the khans.  Left over  from
watching over the harems, thus the reason for being eunuchs.  But  it's
taken on a more spiritual role now, and hijras have a place in  everyday
society at weddings, births, etc...  And of course there are temples  to
the goddess Kali, to Shiva, to Ganesha, etc.  And you might want to  see
how in America we still have churches of every possible denomination.

Jesus Christ is well worshipped in the land of Microsoft and  iPod
dear Marcus.  Oops back to you sir.

What the fuck kind of world view are you attempting to accrue with  the
thoughts you put forth?

Are you living under a rock that you don't actually know about the  vastly
growing "alternative" medicine culture in America?  And guess what  Marcus?
That "alternative" medicine culture is basing everything they know on
medicine FAR older (in fact often ancient) than the doctors you oops me  on.

Oops yourself you knuckle-head!

     If anyone is interested, I wrote a long essay about this, & about BUK, and published it last year on PFS Post. Google "Learning from Bukowski", it'll come right up. Or in the archives at www.artrecess.blogspot.com

I really loved Bukowski in high school. My boyfriend read me Bukowski. I
read all the Bukowski I could get my hands on.
I thought the titles of his books were great!  For instance, Play the Piano
Drunk Like a Percussion Instrument Until the Fingers Begin to Bleed a Bit.
That's a long title and I'll never forget it because it made such an
impression on me. It made sense to me. It was funny and sad. Looking at it
now, I like the p's and the b's in there. I'm not that fond of long titles
that just say something funny now, but I'm also not that interested in
getting drunk and bleeding. I was in high school. I recently watched
Bukowski: Born Into This, the documentary on Bukowski that came out last
summer. My Dad bought it for me because he knew how much I liked Bukowski 7
years ago. I honestly think if I still saw the world the way Bukowski saw
it, which is that life is hell, you're lonely, life is hell, you're lonely,
then I'd still like his work. But I guess that's really too simple because
he also derived a lot of pleasure from writing and his cats and Linda
Bukowski.

He was really committed to writing, probably because he really needed it. (=
I
imagine, in some form, that all writers do need writing, maybe not as
desperately as him . . .) I can still feel that need for the writing in his
work, I think that comes through. I think that drive, determination (and
desperation) is interesting. Bukowski went through the meat grinder, was al=
l
cut up, poured alcohol all over himself, and somehow never killed himself,
and wrote very funny, sad things. As we know, he was very crude and
disgusting, but also a bit charming. I think some of his writing is like
that, too. (His beer shit stories are hysterical!) I haven't looked at it i=
n
a while, but go take a peek at Play the Piano Drunk Like a . . . maybe some
of the poems in there do what I remember them doing.


Best,
Anna Vitale

I think this ties back to the Elizabeth Bishop stir - to control or not  flow. It has to do with isolating a product that can be sucked into a  system and so a hierarchy - the honkie hierarchy - versus process and  its mess and scramble and gleamings - struggle - which is actual - and  so of much more use as it is our condition. Such remains a possibility  - unifinished - it opens - something to be added - we are possible as  we are unfinished - and so we can breathe - we can extend. We can keep  going - and it keep going.  Poetry is prophetic, then - unrealized  - and to do that it's a profanity. We need the shit.

Although the intention is understood, the fact-parade here, remains
distorted. Hijras are not considered "auspicious" in marriage ceremonies
in many parts of India. India is very diverse country where a completely
different language is spoken nearly every 200 miles. I also doubt if the
"Hijra"s have taken on a "more spiritual role". A large part of this rather
marginal and impoverished community survived through decades living off an
ancient Indian prejudice. It was believed that a male child grows up to be a
prosperous young man only if he was blessed by the eunuchs, aka "Hijra"s.

You said - < these men are left over from the times of the khans>. That's
not accurate either.Hijras were part of the mainstream Indian society way
before the advent of the Moguls. The great Indian epics, Ramayana and
Mahabharata, both include "Hijra" characters. They were called "kleeb"
meaning "asexual".

The hijras present a very interesting cultural persona and have been
written about by many Indian writers. Their marginalization, both sexual
and economic, has led to a number of indepth studies. My second
verse-collection, "Weathercock Mind" includes a section of 16 poems titled
"Bimal-Bimalaa" where I talk about two eunuchs "Bimal" and "Bimalaa", who
discover in themselves, many fragments of our normal social relationships -
like a friend is a wife is a brother is a sister is a parent is a guru is a
disciple.

It was attempt to look at the world with "asexual" (unindoctrinated) eyes.

Beautiful studio in the heart of the sunny Mission.

Fantastic location, right between Mission and Valencia, yet quiet and
peaceful. Short walk to BART and Dolores Park, steps from great restaurants
& cafes, independent bookstores, bars, galleries, murals, performance
spaces, etc.

Lots of light, high ceilings, separate spacious kitchen, gas stove, clawfoot
tub, queen-sized bed, very charming with chandeliers & stained glass
windows. Back deck overlooking beautiful garden.

$975 for the month, plus security deposit.

I'm trying to find a non-smoker for June 9 through July 9. A portion of this
time might also be possible.

Please backchannel if you're interested. Thank you.

ALPHANUMERIC PAINTINGS by AUGUST HIGHLAND

"Sacred Burial Grounds"

I'm posting this reply to the list; I hope Tom Orange doesn't mind (it
started as a reply to him)

Charles -- you have to do it anew each time -- start with the author's
publications, institutions, towns, see if they are still around, the =
library
reference books, look at the big networks of links like Selby's -- the
turnover is 100% annually in publishing, so I don't see the point of =
list
management --

I want to say that I generally try to give the curator of any reading =
series
/ host of any reading, classroom visit, etc. I read in a copy of any =
books I
have around to give and s/he doesn't have since I think that's a =
valuable
thing do to, and also because my experience has been that many authors =
treat
curators as customers rather than colleagues, and I good curators work =
very
hard, and I HEARTILY encourage giving books to curators; I object to the
requirement to use a book as a $10-$15 application fee for a reading or
other opportunity, when we all know so few of those queries pan out.

In order to get readings at local venues in LA, features at open mikes,
etc., it is pretty common to have to submit or be asked to submit your =
book
or books; to apply to book fairs, to try to get your hometown library to
order a couple copies, to apply for readings at academic institutions =
with
reading series, ditto (sometimes I send a SASE in hopes that they'll =
return
them, especially schools, which I would hope would at least recognize
MLA-standard application policies); in many bookstores, one is =
encouraged to
donate books (or consign them where you know you'll never see the book =
or
money again).

what formed this habit locally was curators trying to make a distinction
between 1) slammers who have progressed to self producing chapbooks they
sell at readings, and 2) those who read from crumpled notebook paper, =
when
they aren't bothering to know about potential readers outside their =
coterie
-- i.e., a lot of these curators of reading series, after they say, no =
you
really have to send me your books or I really won't schedule you, when =
they
receive the books, are like, OH WOW these are books! now I'm going to =
sell
them on Amazon

I know Walter Lew's advice to me has always been, treat your books like
really, really expensive business cards, but they're too expensive!  I
suppose I want to treat CD Rom business cards with .pdfs of the books on
them like business cards, and treat books like $10 gifts to people I =
think
should have them, curators who've scheduled me, reviewers who've =
expressed
interest in reviewing the books, people who cut my hair, neighbors, etc.

All best,
Catherine

Go Gwyn.

Bukowski is very often funny - I've laughed at his poems, though I agree
with whoever said it's also clich=E9 stuff about horse races and working men
etc - but he's almost wholly misogynistic in his writing about women. I
guess people still think this is okay and not worth objecting to, just as
"sexism" is not up there with "racism" as objectionable speech on this
list's guidelines.

Wasn't he a mentor of Tom Waits? I'll give him this as a plus.

Because all things are not possible at once. You cannot be alive and dead,
flying and burrowing, skiing and sleeping, all at once. You cannot be in
New York and Paris at the same time. You cannot be dying of a virus and
perfectly healthy at the same time. There is no frictionless surface and no
perpetual motion machine and Mohammed Abatcha does not really have
34 million dollars to give you if you'll only send him a check for $50,000 to
prove your bona fides. The notion that there are contradictions, ineluctable,
inevitable contradictions, is obvious to the meanest amoeba -- why isn't it
obvious to you?

I'll bet they're not the same people, though. You can find Bushites, perhaps
the guy next to you at work, who fevently believe that the Iraq war is a
righteous war -- are you committed to that war because they are?
Propinquity is unpersuasive. The fact that someone believes in something
is no guarantee that it's worth believing in.

You're the one writing on the computer claiming that mandalas are bending
energy that no one can show the results of using, or even test for. The
contradiction lies not in the fact that some people are religious and some
are not and they live next door to each other; the contradiction lies in those
who shout that they believe something that, if they really believed it, would
make them forego the use of the medium in which they are shouting.

The world in which we can make testable hypotheses -- and then test them,
modify them, and test them again. Mere assertions of belief or fact are
insufficient. Don't just tell me, show me. You think mandalas bend energy?
Devise a theory of that energy, and a test to demonstrate the bending that
is replicable. Until then, it's just more religious crap that enslaves people, I
think deliberately, to slave for temporal powers for nonexistent supernatural
rewards. In short, fraud.

Too bad millions and millions of people died over the aeons, and still die,
when "alternative" medicines are all that exist; too bad germ theory and
hygiene and sulfa drugs and the rest of modern medicine have
demonstrated conclusively that the history of "alternative" medicine has
been almost completely the history of the placebo effect or blind luck.

I'm confident that, if you are consistent in your beliefs, the next time you fall
ill or break a bone or whatever, you'll call the monks and have them bend
some energy your way through a mandala. Show us you have the courage
of your convictions!

There are those of us who want to have the conversation, but I, at least,
don't see the good in trying to shout people down or engage in name-
calling.

Here, at least, we can agree, at least to some extent. You're still trying to
use "class structure" in what I view as a too absolute sense. You seem to
believe that there is something in non-degree artists that degreed artists
either never had or have had trained out of them. You seem to believe that
not knowing much about one's predecessors is a worthy thing; that the less
one knows the more original one can be. That's wrong, of course, since if
you don't know what's been done before you can have no notion of whether
what one is doing is going to be taken as original by people who DO know
what your predecessors did. Much of the lip-pursing head-shaking eye-
rolling condescension of those who DO know stems from the fear that the
ignorant are not merely ignorant but venal.

It's not missing the point, it's reflecting that Catullus, among others, did it
better -- and long before. Not to mention the amusement in discovering that
Bukowski's biggest fans have seldom heard of Catullus, and have almost
never ready any, and even when they have, they don't have the
contextualized awareness of Western literature to compare Catullus's place
in Latin to Bukowski's in English. Part of the pleasure of being an educated
person inheres in the joy of reflecting on connections among a wide variety
of artists across different cultures through a long time line. Part of the
pleasure of ignorance is that one can be certain one is right without having
to do scarcely any work at all. Experience tells you which one is the higher
pleasure.

That is nonsensical, I believe.
I think that all things may be impossible,
but surely not at the same time!
In fact, I don't really believe that all things are not possible.
Some things will never be not possible.

Implicit/Complicit: Performance By My Invisible
=20
Within  the past year, Providence-based writers Popahna Brandes, Carolina
Maugeri, and Miranda F. Mellis formed the string collaborative, My
Invisible.  Their recombinant sound ranges from pop, art rock, to ethereal
chamber noir. Tonight's performance will be based on a song
cycle-in-progress, and followed by a discussion of the band's collaborative
process. My Invisible debuted in January as the opening act for Rebecca
Gates at The Knitting Factory and has recently accompanied Anne Waldman at
Providence's Downcity Poetry Series. "Implicit/Complicit" is a song on the
band's eponymous first album (available at www.myinvisible.com). Popahna
Brandes is the director of International Inkwell, a yearly writing workshop
program in Montelieu, France.=A0Carolina Maugeri is currently writing a lyric
sequence exploring images of children's street art in her hometown of
Tokuyama, now Shunan-shi, Japan. Miranda F. Mellis is an editor at
Encyclopedia (www.encyclopediaproject.org). Most recently her stories have
appeared in Denver Quarterly and Fence.

I am obviously ignorant. I thought poetic experimentation provided
superheroic abilities to be at once alive and dead, flying and
burrowing, skiing and sleeping, New York and Paris, virus and healthy,
frictionless surface and perpetual motion--all at the same time.

Because all things are not possible at once. You cannot be alive and
dead,
flying and burrowing, skiing and sleeping, all at once. You cannot be in

New York and Paris at the same time. You cannot be dying of a virus and
perfectly healthy at the same time. There is no frictionless surface and
no
perpetual motion machine and Mohammed Abatcha does not really have
34 million dollars to give you if you'll only send him a check for
$50,000 to
prove your bona fides. The notion that there are contradictions,
ineluctable,
inevitable contradictions, is obvious to the meanest amoeba -- why isn't
it
obvious to you?

I'll bet they're not the same people, though. You can find Bushites,
perhaps
the guy next to you at work, who fevently believe that the Iraq war is a

righteous war -- are you committed to that war because they are?
Propinquity is unpersuasive. The fact that someone believes in something

is no guarantee that it's worth believing in.

You're the one writing on the computer claiming that mandalas are
bending
energy that no one can show the results of using, or even test for. The
contradiction lies not in the fact that some people are religious and
some
are not and they live next door to each other; the contradiction lies in
those
who shout that they believe something that, if they really believed it,
would
make them forego the use of the medium in which they are shouting.

The world in which we can make testable hypotheses -- and then test
them,
modify them, and test them again. Mere assertions of belief or fact are
insufficient. Don't just tell me, show me. You think mandalas bend
energy?
Devise a theory of that energy, and a test to demonstrate the bending
that
is replicable. Until then, it's just more religious crap that enslaves
people, I
think deliberately, to slave for temporal powers for nonexistent
supernatural
rewards. In short, fraud.

Too bad millions and millions of people died over the aeons, and still
die,
when "alternative" medicines are all that exist; too bad germ theory and

hygiene and sulfa drugs and the rest of modern medicine have
demonstrated conclusively that the history of "alternative" medicine has

been almost completely the history of the placebo effect or blind luck.

I'm confident that, if you are consistent in your beliefs, the next time
you fall

bend
some energy your way through a mandala. Show us you have the courage

There are those of us who want to have the conversation, but I, at
least,
don't see the good in trying to shout people down or engage in name-
calling.

Here, at least, we can agree, at least to some extent. You're still
trying to
use "class structure" in what I view as a too absolute sense. You seem
to
believe that there is something in non-degree artists that degreed
artists
either never had or have had trained out of them. You seem to believe
that
not knowing much about one's predecessors is a worthy thing; that the
less
one knows the more original one can be. That's wrong, of course, since
if
you don't know what's been done before you can have no notion of whether

what one is doing is going to be taken as original by people who DO know

what your predecessors did. Much of the lip-pursing head-shaking eye-
rolling condescension of those who DO know stems from the fear that the
ignorant are not merely ignorant but venal.

It's not missing the point, it's reflecting that Catullus, among others,
did it
better -- and long before. Not to mention the amusement in discovering
that
Bukowski's biggest fans have seldom heard of Catullus, and have almost
never ready any, and even when they have, they don't have the
contextualized awareness of Western literature to compare Catullus's
place
in Latin to Bukowski's in English. Part of the pleasure of being an
educated
person inheres in the joy of reflecting on connections among a wide
variety
of artists across different cultures through a long time line. Part of
the
pleasure of ignorance is that one can be certain one is right without
having
to do scarcely any work at all. Experience tells you which one is the
higher
pleasure.

Poetry Machine
A project by David Link

Poetry Machine is a text generator based on semantic networks. Users
can enter concepts that are meaningful to them or for which they
expect an answer. Poetry Machine responds with a never ending stream
of sentences that circulate around these words. Since these answers
are not dependent on scripted answering modules that were written
beforehand but are generated dynamically, they are always different
and never repeat themselves. They are printed out on a projection
screen and spoken out loudly by a text-to-speech system. The semantic
information of Poetry Machine comes mainly from the internet.
Autonomous "bots" continuously search the internet for concepts that
are still unknown to the program and feed the resulting documents
back into its database. Consequently, the content of the database and
the output of the machine change over time.

Subject:      Plays on Words: First Night
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

The first night of "Plays on Words," the poets theater festival at
the Ontological Hysteric Theater in New York, was a delight for mind,
ear, and eye. 22 short pieces were performed, providing a glimpse of
22 different approaches to writing and directing, a veritable primer
for poets theater.

The no-budget evening of imaginatively staged readings was filled
with possibilities, which, if not always fully realized, was
continually engaging. Tony Torn, Lee Ann Brown, and Corinna Copp are
to be congratulated, and supported, for starting off what I hope will
be an annual affair. I was glad to be a part of this: Leandra Ramm, a
young and very talented singer, did a great job performing the
weather aria from Ben Yarmolinsky and my "Blind Witness News."

The show-stealer was surely four-year-old Miranda, daughter of Lee
Ann and Tony, whose several appearance were nothing short of star
turns. However, for me the real hit of the evening was Tony Torn
himself, doing one brilliant piece of acting after another, from a
great rendition of Gregory Corso in Tom Savage's amusing "Mouth Play"
(directed by Mallory Catlet) to a scarily comic version of Richard
Nixon in Rachel Loden's "A Quaker Meeting in Yorba Linda" (directed
by David Henderson) to, finally, a tour-de-force in Kelly Cooper's
"I'm doing fine," in which Torn provided several dozen different
readings of the title line. Tony, really, you are doing fine.

The festival continues tomorrow (Friday) -- and I have a chance for
my big break. I will be playing the (small) part of Jason Robards
opposite the real Kate Valk (playing herself) and Angelica Torn
(playing Hannah Schygulla) in Brian Kim Stefan's short play "Were
Stones Gather." Also on the bill: works by Charles Borkhuis and David
Henderson. More info at

A respected forum since 1962 for new work in English literary studies, =
ELN (English Language Notes) has undergone a change in editorship and an =
extensive makeover as a biannual journal devoted exclusively to special =
topics in all fields of literary and cultural studies. The new ELN hopes =
to provide a unique forum for cutting-edge scholarly debate and exchange =
in the humanities.=20

The Spring 2006 issue, "Literary History and The Religious Turn," is now =
available at a special single-issue rate of $20. Focusing on the study =
of literary history over the last decade, ELN 44.1 ranges from the =
preoccupation among medievalists with "vernacular theology" to the =
fascination with the topoi of conversion in postcolonial studies.=20

Of possible interest to readers of this list, ELN 44.1 also features a =
section on "Innovative Poetry and the Question of Spirit," edited by =
Patrick Pritchett, and with essays and poems from Elizabeth Robinson, =
Andrew Joron, Peter O'Leary, and Fanny Howe.=20

Let me get a bit seriouser about it. Well, I am not talking about
alternative medicine, rather the source of such medicines. Serious research
is being done and all biotech / pharma companies including, Glaxo,
Ellie-lilly, pharmacia are doing intense research on plant products to
isolate compounds that can be used as drugs for a variety of diseases
including, arthritis, Obesity, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, cancer etc etc
etc... Guess, from where the clues come ? The ancient practises of using
such and such plant-juice for such an such ailment. Trust me, when I say
this -- I am a molecular biologist by profession who has been working on
such projects. As example you can look for the term "Guggulsterone" in
google.

The problem, with this kind of ancient knowledge is the distortion of the
knowledge that has occurred over the centuries. Primary culprits were the
inventors of  malady-cures, who to protect their own interest and avoid
competition would pass on the knowledge only to immediate family members and
if such family members were not as smart as the originator, or more simply
put-- morons, they would distort it not having the power of proper
comprehension and this will amplify over the years.

The hypolipidemic natural product guggulsterone acts as an antagonist of the

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of health care and medicine, has a
well-organized materia medica in which plants form a dominant part. A key
illustration of the exploitation of this knowledge toward the development of
a modern drug is the isolation and characterization of two
antihyperlipidemic compounds, Z-, and E-guggulsterone from the tree
Commiphora mukul, the exudate of which has been traditionally used for
mitigating lipid disorders. Here, we demonstrate that Z-guggulsterone and an
analog, 80-574 currently in clinical trials, act as antagonists of the bile
acid receptor (BAR), a member of the intracellular receptor superfamily.
These compounds antagonize the activity of BAR in vitro, and in cell culture
systems on promoters and endogenous target genes. In biochemical assays,
they are able to displace coactivator peptides from the receptor in a
dose-dependent manner. The mechanism by which they act as BAR antagonists is
likely through their inability to recruit coactivator proteins, failure to
release corepressor proteins from unliganded receptor, and ability to
compete with BAR agonists to block coactivator recruitment. Our data suggest
these compounds may mediate at least some of their effects via the BAR.

Jimmy Hoffa, or Amelia Earhart, or Jim Morrison, or any of a
number of other such cases) is really alive.

Just so -- at least here you admit you're not talking about what Conrad
claimed, but about something different. That's progress, of a sort, I
suppose, but still no support for Conrad's claim.

I think this is a rather gendercentric perspective or western
appropriation.. to call them men or even to consider them male is to
do harm.. I have never meet one, or corresponded with a hijras that
does not deal with similar issues as western transgendered folks..in
other words a penis or clitoris does not make a gendered person...
and the self-inflicted wound you talk about., i.e. castration is
illegal,  and many are going for western reassignment surgery, and
true there maybe some who go though ritual castration, The ones I have
corresponded with have either not had surgery or gone to Medical
Doctors..

Aryanil I agree with you..
  Hijras are not considered "auspicious" in marriage ceremonies
> in many parts of India.

yes only in select areas and in many areas, the word Hijras is not
even used. this could be due to the many different languages and
dialects spoken in India... the only universal is on Indian pass ports
where they can choose a third gender or "eunuch".

but mostly they are reduced to begging and prostitution...


> It was attempt to look at the world with "asexual" (unindoctrinated) eyes=
.

Aryanil, this is where I have to digress a bit from the "asexual"
label that may have been put on Hijras or india's "legal eunuchs."
India is a heterosexual economy and like most heterosexual economies,
the role one takes on is usually within this paradigm.. for this
reason, many "legal eunuchs" get married, have dreams of heterosexual
relationships, date.. so on and so on. since they see themselves as
female... and the sexual economy here is rather limited.. so, this is
the options open to them..

just to clarify a bit...

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the list has
about 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial number of
nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web site (see
archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep in mind
the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support
and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one: in
most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the list,
and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv editorial
board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which calls for all
messages to be read and approved before being forwarded to the list. We
prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the spontaneity of discussion
that we hope to promote. In addition to these options, the editorial
board will unsubscribe individuals if they are not, in our opinion,
productively contributing to the list or following our guidelines. We
remain committed to this editorial function as a defining element of the
Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about this
list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The
idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather than
general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list relatively
small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the list are
generally 50 messages per day, and one or two messages per subscriber
per day; but these limits are subject to change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the EPC.

2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions
of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. We strongly
encourage subscribers to post information, including web links, relating
to publications (print and internet), reading series, and blogs that
they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear. Such
announcements constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly to
the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in automatic
deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy, should
be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the
"from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.
Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post will be
unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu
this one-line message with no "subject": sub poetics [your Firstname and
Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and not
receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to the
list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics nomail.
Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with the
author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you can
also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or in
HTML format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set
poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or digest
mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of time. Your
account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics messages as well as
other important mail. In such cases, switch your subscription to
"nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then
resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while critique
of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main
functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique or
criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes competing
interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with our
collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent
in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for
all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from
this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's
permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of
published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that you
get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see
if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not
posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to
contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

<It was attempt to look at the world with "asexual" (unindoctrinated)

KE-Aryanil, this is where I have to digress a bit from the "asexual"
label that may have been put on Hijras or india's "legal eunuchs."
India is a heterosexual economy and like most heterosexual economies,
the role one takes on is usually within this paradigm.. for this
reason, many "legal eunuchs" get married, have dreams of heterosexual
relationships, date.. so on and so on. since they see themselves as
female... and the sexual economy here is rather limited.. so, this is
the options open to them..

just to clarify a bit...

Well I'm not trying to make a statement about the hijras or the transexual
/transgendered people of India in the above line. I talked about my last
verse-collection, and a series of poems it contains. The "asexual" viewpoint
is my own; and in those poems, I try to see, primarily a materialistic and a
grossly sexually-biased or tinted world, through the eyes of two companions
- "Bimal" and "Bimalaa". Whether they can be seen as hijras or transexual or
heterosexual people or even as Indians, is quite up to the reader. The
"asexual" notion, as I had mentioned, was derived from the Sanskrit word
"kleeb" - used to describe ancient Indian eunuchs, or for that matter
anything that is "genderless". For example a fruit, a tree, a leaf - ancient
Indian metaphysical texts refer to many living objects as "kleeb" or
genderless while others have either female or male "organ"s.

The "hijra" problems you refer to, are indeed real, current and more recent
in history. I did try to reflect on those a little bit - like Bimal and
Bimalaa live in a "hermaphrodite colony", many of their friends make their
living as "prostitutes" and/or "beggers", but at the same time, I tried to
transcend the social issues to create a vision that is "kleeb", that tries
to fetch a little truth from objects and things that we normally miss out
on, when we look at them as "males" or "females".

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Thanks for all those responses re: buk and bc...interesting range of views

a couple of points

1 does anyone on the listserv read bc?  hell yes.  I recently read some
closely to try to figure out just what he's doing.

2. I never heard Waits claim buk as a mentor, but he does say he likes
buk's writing

3. memorable poems--one of my ideas on these guys is that they don't give
us those poetic peaks..however I'll offer the 1 poem from each that I
recall very favorably

for buk it's Miriam ... don't ask why, but it stands out and others
don't...it's in the orange cover book i think..... burning in
water...etc...

for bc there's a poem in which the persona is reviewing his life...but
rather than reviewing it from the vantage of a 50-60-70 yr old it's from a
much younger age, something like 7 or 9...I don't know the title or book,
but that one i do remember as an interesting idea, unique take on the
'gold watch' tyhpe speech

and finally. . .

I  completely agree, muff diving is best done when sober, esp if you care
about impressing the recipient favorably--then again, all sex is best when
senses are not muted....

Hehehe!  Yeah!  That's GREAT!  (first Gwyn, and then  Joseph)


Gwyn, you have such a great WAY of blistering with anger!  I like  that!
And I also like all your talk about your pussy, etc., and NO, I don't  have
any mileage on it at all.  I've been a cocksucker since the  start.

Oh the drunken muff diving.  Well, more assumptions I suppose.

Gwyn it is possible Bukowski was all the things we think of, but
more too.  You can see it in his later poems, which by the way
are still coming out in magazines as we argue about him.  (that's
no lie, he's in the 2005 AMERICAN BEST OF, and he's been
dead for TWELVE YEARS!)

It's kind of STUNNING to see a man who has written exclusively about
his feelings about his body, his body's functions, his gripes and his
loves to COME TO THIS other place at the end which is like he HITS
this wide summit of ice and he's sliding along it with moments of
total clarity, BAM! these epiphanies striking flint!  Do you know  what
I mean?

Okay okay, I get it that it's NOT exciting to read him once you've  gone
onto to discover Ceravolo, then to discover Bergvall, and on and on,
but totally dismissing him as you wanted with your summation of his
work was kind of just missing all his sharper edges.  And of course  you
don't have to look at it, nor do you have to WANT to.   That's fine, but to
say you KNOW his work enough to make the assumptions and to make
such summations is what I question.

Which brings me to Joseph.
Joseph, you accuse me with your brittle comparison of being "someone"
who can dismiss Bishop while at the same time being someone who
knocks others for dismissing Bukowski.

Well Joseph, you might want to consider REREADING the posts you are
referring to on Bishop.  Because Joseph, in those posts I make it  very
clear that I DID read her poems.  In fact, not only do I say that I  read them
but that I have friends who LOVE her so much that they made me reread
the poems with them.

Point being Joseph, that maybe a few folks on this Listserv you  claim that
I dismiss so easily for dismissing Bukowski might be the very ones  who
have NOT done their reading?  In fact, it's awfully interesting that  we get
Pierre Joris, a man who has co-edited one of the most amazing pair of
anthologies on poetry I've ever seen saying Bukowski had maybe up to
100 pages of "excellent" work.

100 pages, that's great!  Do you realize that Ezra Pound says in  that
book the ABC of Reading that Whitman only had a handful of lines
worth reading?  Bukowski gets 100 pages from Joris, but Pound  only
attributes a handful of lines for Whitman!  Wow, that's saying
something man!!!!  And you and I should BE SO LUCKY to die
with 100 pages of work someone as noteworthy as Joris calls
"excellent" don't you think?


Granted I haven't read an entire book of Bukowski in many years, but  as
these later, last poems constantly pop up in magazines I read them,
and can see the Buddha I mentioned.  (by the way, I had NO idea  that
ANGER was going to come at me with the back channels when I
"dared" called Bukowski a Buddha.  But I do it again, both  because
I really do mean it, and also to irritate the shit out of some folks!
Buddha would laugh at you with me I think!)


My love to you both Gwyn and Joseph, whether you want it or not,

Kari & Aryanil,
my information on hijras comes from a few sources, all questionable.
And no, I have not ever met a hijra, so I base it on the sources.

Zia Jaffery's book THE INVISIBLES for one.  Which I LOVED  reading.
But, must admit that when I was working at Giovanni's Room Bookshop
at the time of that book's publication, there were trans-activists I  know
who would FREAK OUT about that book.  They HATED IT!  In  fact they
hated it so much that I actually hid the fact that I liked it.

While I admit that I hid the fact that I liked the book, I never once  by
the way pretended to have an opinion one way or the other to them.
Just to make that clear.  Meaning I just never discussed it.

They discussed it however, and based most of their hatred for the  book
on the hatred for it by an Indian-born trans-activist friend of theirs,  whose
name I forget and probably would butcher if I tried to spell it  here.  But
the gist of the hatred I gathered was Jaffery's sensationalized  version
of what hijras lives are really like.  That for one, she barely  mentions the
brutality they face in some parts of India.

But still, I liked the book.  I liked it because it WOWED me,  opened
up this whole world the likes of which I had never encountered.  You  know
what I mean?  To be honest I kind of sensationalized them myself  maybe
by romanticizing their world a bit too much.  Of course I kept  thinking
to myself, Hmm, how could I BE in their world and still keep my  balls?
Anyway, the book captured my attention in more than one way.

Also, there was a documentary on India I saw which kind of  disappointed
me because it wound up sounding more like a travel film than an  actual
documentary if you know what I mean, and at one point a small group
of hijras was filmed outside a wedding.  And the narrator made  them
sound EVEN MORE sensational that even Zia Jaffery, and talked about
the networks the hijras have to find out when weddings take place so
they can come, sing, and receive money.

Zia Jaffery hints at the hermaphrodites as I recall.  And makes them  to
be the most auspicious.

BUT LET ME SAY TOO that you are very right to point out my gender
pronoun choice of "he."  But at the same time there are no hijras (as  far
as I know) who were biological females.  Maybe I'm wrong though.   And
this is not to dismiss my "he" usage so much as to explain.

Having worked in the gay, lesbian, bi, trans community for almost  seven
years, I'm well aware of how important pronouns are for many people.

The cover of Jaffery's book has a still from a documentary about  hijras
that I still have yet to see.  Maybe that film would shed better  light?
Has anyone seen this?

Astonishing Humorlesssness: your comments below

Astonishingly Ugly Additude:  Your statement in that
first reply to Conrad, that you "hoped" Natural
Selection would weed out the sort of people you find
illogical (by the way, does Marcus know that whatever
C.A. might feel about Eastern spiritual consciousness
versus Western, that he has celebrated Western
*secular* consciousness in the form of Benjamin's
Franklin's spirit of Invention, & did some sort of
project about B.F. that was shown in a Philadelphia
museum?--bucking the trend of what D.H. Lawrence,
William Carlos Williams, Melville, and others have
said about the lighting rod man?

Subject:      Re: What do Buk and Billy Collins and Charles Bernstein Have in
              Common?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

       Sartre and Genet at one point said that Bukowski was America's
greatest living writer--for a long time he was much better known in the land
of his birth, Germany, and in France than in the USA.  (There's the book &
film SHAKESPEARE NEVER DID THIS abt Bukowski's triumphal return to his
German hometown--he wdn't serve in WW2 as proud of his German heritage.)
Bukowski's recognized as a writer in the line of Hemingway as well as Celine
(who interestingly enough both died on the same day).
       I.E.  Bukowski is recognized as Literature--by some Literary
Giants--which is what he wrote for--to be up there with his beloved "Hem"
and "Dost"--
        He's also a Celebrity and a Counter Culture hero--I am sure he must
have made the pages of People magazine at some point--
       The most interesting experience I ever had regarding Bukowski was abt
five years ago in an outpatient program for addict/alcoholics.  This was
made up of both genders, Black and White people and working class and below
(people on SSI-disability etc).  After a certain point in the program one of
the two counselors decided that one day a week we wd watch a movie dealing
with alcoholism or drug addiction and talk about it in relation with things
we were learning about in (recovery.  One fine afternoon the movie we were
going to see was BARFLY--based on Bukowski's life and work, with a script
written by him.  The counselor asked if anyone had heard of this guy
Bukwswki--I said yes and talked to her a few minutes--she said after the
film and discussion--to give a little tlkl re the poet--but first let
everyone see the film and discuss it in terms of recovery.
          No one expected much from the films we saw--how real is Hollywood
going to get abt addiction and alcoholism anyway?  What seems shocking in
the Bukowski books is pretty routine among the alkie set, the lighter side
of the greater darkness just a few steps further on. The guy on the screen
is just another alcoholic asshole like hundreds everyone has known and been
themselves often enough. The poetry angle that gives some hope is a familiar
story--bars are full of people who are would be stars of song and stage,
poetry and music, painting and all sorts of arts.  People kept
fidgeting--the movie was painfully dull!  After the film everyone agreed it
had been too fake, too glamorized and too sentimental.  But then it was a
Hollywood film!  What do you expect?
        After the critique came the recovery part--
         Then the counselor announced I would "share about the author".
Everybody's interested--one of their own will give them the scoop.  I talked
a while --told some anecdotes and what I knew of Bukowski and his books--i
like telling stories so got caught up in it--and people started laughing and
having a grand old time.  You start telling stories abt an alcoholic from an
addict/alcoholic point of view to a room full of the same--and it can get
pretty hilarious.  Things straight people and "normies" wd never think of,
angles on the angles, labyrinths of the labyrinths, the marvels of bullshit
the alcoholic/addict mind can concoct.
          Afterwards I was hoping maybe some of my peers wd be interested in
the books and said the library had a lot of them.  A bunch of voices went
up--no man, we want you to keep telling us stories!  Fuck that stupid guy in
the motherfuckin movie!  Fuck the movies! Just tell stories every week!
        And I thought we had it clear the guy in the movie isnt the same as
the guy in the books!  I mean that in real life he's a Writer--along with
all the rest of it--still a Writer--one of the few who writes of all this as
the Real Deal . . . (or the purported real deal--as they say--angles on the
angles!)
        My bad!
         CA--maybe you missed it--but before I had mentioned there is
already a very good Bukowski anthology--RUN WITH THE HUNTED  A CHARLES
BUKOWSKI READER  edited by John Martin (NY:  Harper Perennial, 1994)  it is
arranged chronologically not by dates of the writing, but by place in the
writer's life the pieces--prose and poetry--are writing about--so constructs
a form of memoir--
        Thank you to Gwen and Allison for their letters--and for the
latter's point that sexism unlike racism seems to be to some degree
tolerated on this list--sadly this is time after time shown to be true--
       Anne Vitale made I thought the best point abt Bukwoski--that he was a
committed writer.  He worked his ass off, to the end.  Wrote for years in
obsucirty while working at the Post Office--and labored away in skin
magazines while being lauded abroad and ignored a good deal at home. He was
an alcoholic asshole no doubt abt it and charming also as alcoholics can be
and his attitudes towards women compounded by alcoholsim could be pretty
hideous--(and not unlike hundreds of men i have known)--but then a good
number of the most poltically correct and self righteously ethical people i
have met have often turned out to be monsters of one form or another also--
       I am still wondering since it's often asserted that Billy Collins,
Bukowski and Charles Bernstein each have written recognizable ouevres but
not memorable poems what they might have in common?
(Besides the letters "C B/ BC" in their initials)

I think people misunderstood me--i am just having a sense of humor abt all
this discussion---"what do billy collins and bukowski have in common"--and
then people bashing one or the other--or sanctifying one or the other--when
they have nothing in common other than being very popular--
i think what is being fetishized is arguing--perhaps--

it can and has been said of any number of artists in any number of fields--
just as there are people known forever as "one hit wonders"--

friday afternoon when its rainy--

hey,
it's rainy where you are, too?
Thanks for "sharing" what you did with the list. I really have a soft spot
for Bukowski. Because of his commitment, in some twisted way, to himself,
maybe. Being an alcoholic really isn't a commitment to oneself, but writing=
,
I think, very much can be. (that's not the only thing it is, but . . .)

I'm glad you appreciated my mentioning of his commitment. Seeing the
documentary about him, Bukowski: Born Into This, reminded me of what I like=
d
about him/ his work, which . . . how inseparable are those things anyway?
Just like, if we can't separate content and form, how can we separate the
writer from the writing? It seems like a dog chasing his tail to me,
sometimes. And here, I'm hoping to open a can of worms because I've been
wondering about "authorship" and people's desire to find something "good in
the work" and who cares about the life of the author? ? ?

Best, on this rainy Friday evening, now,
Anna (Vitale)

Regarding David-Baptiste's amiable question --
what do Charles Bukowski, Billy Collins,
and Charles Bernstein have in common?

Here's a small list:

1) a B.C. name
2) a 4-syllable name (if you go the "Chuck Bukowski" route)
3) all are circa-20th-century American poets of some renown
4) probably 98% of their genetic code is virtually IDENTICAL!

. . . and that's not even the half of it.

Also [to really get into this now]:

5) all of them show a love of writing
6) all of them tend to write in a 20th century idiom (with a few
exceptions in the case of Bernstein, who at times seems to enjoy
18th-19th century mannerisms too -- he's the throw-back it seems)
7) all tend to write in modes of unrhymed open-form prose-ish poetry
(again
with minor sporadic allowances for that School of Quietudish Bernstein
guy)

Heck, I've barely gotten started.  But best stop while I'm ahead --

my half-pretzel worth,
d.i.

I was just wondering, while sitting in the sun at the bALL game today:

What do Charles Bukowski and Diaghelev have in common?

I don't have words written down my spine (ok, this isn't foolproof) and I
don't live in a bookshelf. My books have never been heard snoring or
sneezing and I've never seen them out to dinner or at an opening night. I
might be a fiction, but I am still more than a centimetre thick.

I think big problems result from not distinguishing between writers and
their work. Not out of a desire to find something "good in the work" (?) nor
because of claims of authorship, which are always difficult, but because
they are two different things. If you don't distinguish, it makes the author
a guarantor of a work's authenticity, you get all these "hoaxes" or frauds,
and in the end, who cares about the work?

Alison,

2 cents:

Good points.  Still, without needing to hie oneself
to the nethermost ends of the proposed dichotomy (i.e.,
the dualism under which we either say "Yes writer and
writing are inseparable" versus "No they are entirely
distinct and must never be confounded one w/ the other"),
a middle path, perhaps, could allow that in some useful
respects, the one finds reflection in the other; and=20
that neither would be what it is, lacking the other.

;-)
d.i.

Point taken: but I seldom see that complexity applied...with very few
exceptions, I loathe autobiographical readings of writers' works, because
they're almost always misleading or distorting.

Also, problems like the withdrawal of Peter Handke's play from the
Coemdie-Francaise by the manger, for his political beliefs. The play has
nothing to do with Handke's political beliefs, whatever they are. (Details
on my blog if you're interested). So is that lack of distinction fair
enough?

Sure, but then you get a middling number of hoaxes and frauds.

Just so -- it makes those works what they really are: mere diary entries and
anecdotes. That they are broken up into a ragged right form ceases to distinguish
them as poems once they become autobiography, and can and should be tested for
whether they hew to the facts of the case instead of telling the truth through
metaphor.

I don't think we're talking about the same things. I was thinking of some
things I've read (or more accurately, half read) such as an objectionable
biography of Rilke that lumpenly explicated his poems through incidents in
his life, which seems to me an utterly reductive, not to say sentimental,
way of understanding writing. Which is not to say that a poem might not have
biographical resonance. It's just not the only thing happening. Very few
critics have the tact to illuminate this, though.

As for the "free verse era" - well, free verse is quite a demanding form.
And a lot of contemporary poetry (the interesting stuff, anyway, that tends
to eschew "traditional" forms) is deeply about exploding lazy ideas of "self
expression" or given identity or any such thing. Or so it seems to me.

All best

Bound in traditional Japanese style, with thread through holes
carefully 'stabbed' along the book's left-hand margin.

I'll take your love, CA. Thanks, if you really mean
it. And, like you, who read Bishop, I too read
Bukowski, and a lot of it, though I found his poems
ultimately uninteresting. That's why I was asking for
some specific poems that really wowed you, so I could
focus my attention on them. And maybe you could
explain what it is about those specific poems that you
find interesting.

I have a pretty open mind when it comes to poetry--and
would certainly never say that Buk isn't writing
poetry, or that he's writing bad poetry, only that
he's written many poems that haven't interested me too
much as poems, that is, on the level of language.

Best,
Joseph

Also known as "side stitch" binding or "cross side stitch" binding or
"Oriental side stitch" binding or "Japanese side stitch" binding, or, if
you want to use the Japanese term, Fukuro-toji, even though the bindings
actually were adapted by Japanese bookbinders (and some might say perfected
and highly stylized by them) from Chinese and Korean styles. The bindings
generally have either four holes for stitching, or five. The four hole
style is Chinese, the five hole style is Korean; the specific numbers
probably having to do with superstitions about odd & even numbers.
Generally paper is folded in this binding, with fold-side out as the
unbound edge. There's a pretty good set of instructions for making this
binding on pages 17-20 of the following online PDF --

         http://benrinehart.com/images/pdfs/bb_handouts.pdf

There are some photos of the four-hole books, with four different stitching
variations, here --

         http://www.sengokudaimyo.com/miscellany/books.html

I'd also highly recommend, for these styles of binding as well as many
other Japanese bookbinding styles, the book,

         Ikegami, Kojiro. Japanese Bookbinding: Instructions from a Master
Craftsman (Weatherhill: New York & Tokyo, 1986).

This is one of the few really terrific books in the field of bookmaking.

You mean Sergei Diaghilev, a certain sexual violence, eeriness, stubborness=

This exhibition of recent video art presents diverse perspectives on
codes of culture by artists from around the world.  In YOU COULD BE
LUCKY, YAEL BARTANA observes people acting in patterns of popular
social behaviors, and EDER SANTOS in FRAMED BY CURTAINS and JACQUELINE
BATES in SONO ANDATI, search for meaning in  everyday rituals.  OLGA
EGOROVA (TSAPLYA) presents a humorous lecture on the results of
studying the cultural implications of womenâ€™s underwear in society in
UNDERWEAR.

METHODOLOGICAL OBSERVATION ON DOMESTICATION AND RESEARCH. SNOW ANGEL by
LEONID TISHKOV recalls the artistâ€™s childhood in a mysterious image
of a spiritual journey to the  Ural mountains in Russia, that remains
the source of his inspiration.  HOMAGE by MARTY ST. JAMES is a
self-portrait  with his signature fedora hat that is an homage to a
comradery with family, friends and fellow artists who wear them.  The
chanting of Buddhist monks propel St. Jamesâ€™ dreamlike journey to
locate and inhabit an inner sense of self and  being in spaces existing
between meaning and meaninglessness, the moving and static In KARASELE
by MARCIA GROSTEIN, there is no way to escape for a family trapped in a
cycle of abuse.

MARINA ABRAMOVIC transforms her own fears and emotions into startling
images that frequently take on ritual or ceremonial  forms and that
critique the role that the female body is made to play in Western
culture. INSOMNIA belongs to a three-part installation that explores
the insistent and recurring process of traumatic memory.  PULSE by
SHIRIN NESHAT speaks of the tension between collective cultural
identity and one driven by individual concerns in contemporary  Islam.
This intoxicating work deals with the type of candid sexuality that
occurs when everything is so controlled.

PHLEGETHON-MILCZENIE is a performance-based video, where the artist,
MONIKA WEISS creates a universal memorial to culture destroyed by
tyrants, through symbolic images and music, as well as objects --
pre-WWII German books--  with which she has bodily contact as she draws
around her silhouette.

ANTARCTICA PROJECT by ANDREA JUAN reflects on the impact of human
patterns of consumption on the environment.   NICOLA CONSTANTINOâ€™s
SAVON DE CORPS, reflects on consumerism in society where things are not
what  they seem. In this commercial Constantino is both seductress and
the raw material of the soap product which has been  made with 3
percent of the artistâ€™s body fat. JENNY MARKETOU breaks through the
walls of conventions in TRANSLOCAL: CAMP IN MY TENT, a performative
public intervention, that reveals peopleâ€™s cultural differences in
their diverse interpretations of her identity â€“ threat,  prostitute,
political activist - as they react to the tent she sets up in public
spaces around the world.  In BRAVE NEW  WORLD, THEO ESHETU juxtaposes
technologically developed societies and local cultures.

NAM JUNE PAIK, in the 1960s and 1970s predicted that a global culture
would emerge through technology and the  creation of an  â€œinformation
super highwayâ€ which has come to be realized as the Internet. GOOD
MORNING  MR.ORWELL was the first artwork to use telecommunications to
enable an intercontinental exchange of culture, broadcasting live via
satellite simultaneously between the US, Canada, Germany and South
Korea. CRAZY ENGLISH by  ZHANG YUAN documents the work of Professor Li
Yuang whose unique method of teaching English has reached over  10
million Chinese. Yuang teaches his students to shout in English to
instill the fighting spirit that exists in the cultures of  the US
Europe and Japan in order to build the self-confidence and
communications skills needed to become a global  superpower in the 21st
Century.

New codes of culture are evolving in adaptation to the technological
revolution, altering our perception and daily patterns. This suggests
the possibility of a future of post-human forms of existence and
remodeling of the human body,  mind and consciousness: SANDMAN by
PATRICIA PICCININI, DESKTOP METAPHOR by MATEO ZLATAR and COMPILE by
KATHLEEN RUIZ.




MONIKA WEISS Phlegethon-Milczenie, 2005, 14:57

Polish-born, New York City based artist Monika Weiss creates
environments that relate to the body and to the tension that
characterizes specific relationship between biology and culture. In her
drawings and multi-media installations, combined with performance  and
sound, Weiss explores physical properties of the act of drawing, which
she combines with references to the ancient and medieval symbols and
concepts of the world and the human being. In her installation series
Ennoia, the artist immerses herself for several  hours inside a
water-filled chalice, while a projected image of the immersion and the
underwater sounds mirror her action. In her  ongoing series, Intervals,
Weiss creates drawing landscapes, which are spaces that others may
enter and fill with their own actions.  Recurring motifs in her works
are acts of lying down in an embryo-like position, immersions and the
outlining of one's body.  â€œThroughout history thousands, millions of
pages of esteemed thoughts and theories, were submitted to destruction.


PhlegethonMilczenie speaks of my complex relation to German culture.
Books published before the Second World War â€“ German literature  and
philosophy â€“ become objects of contact with my body, as I lie quietly
on them quietly drawing around my silhouette with char coals.  I
juxtaposed the birdâ€™s view of my action with views of burning fire.
I combined sounds of a burning book â€“ Goetheâ€™s â€œDoctor Faustusâ€
â€“ with voices of Germen speakers reading fragments of poems by Paul
Celan.  Through the method of filming and photographing my own
performances from above, the video becomes a two-dimensional universe
resembling a drawing. The last part  of the video includes recorded and
altered voice of soprano vocalist Anthony Roth Costanzo,  I combined
fragments from Handelâ€™s  The Creation with Pergolesiâ€™s Salve
Regina.â€  Monika Weiss (b. 1964, Poland) is a renowned artist in the
US and Europe and her  work is in important private and museum
collections.

Hey Joseph, man, glad you asked!  There's a new book of his work
out that I want to crack open, maybe in a bookstore, see if some of
those pieces I've seen in magazines the last few years made it in
there and I'll show you.

The thing IS I'm NOT saying the poet moved into BRAND NEW styles
for the likes of our peers and friends (and others, hehe!) on this  list,
but what I AM saying is that if you read this later pieces you get to
really hear him moving out beyond at least the CONTENT of what he
is best known for.

AND I suggest looking at that poem of his in the 2005 BEST OF
AMERICAN POETRY anthology called "The Beats."  I think that's
what it's called.  Now, I have a theory as to WHY that poem is  in
that anthology.  And the truth is that it's a theory which is not  at
all grounded in anything but speculation, so I'll keep it to myself.
But that poem is Bukowski bitching and griping about NOT being
a Beat, NOT wanting to be considered a Beat, etc..

The excerpt below is the kind of thing I'm talking about.  Where  he
gets off onto these tears where his ever-expanding world-view is
shown for us.  AND I like it!  AND dammit I can LIKE this  AND
then LIKE Silliman's book WOUNDWOOD (which I happen to
think is one of THE BEST BOOKS of poetry in the past few years!),
AND think my friends are the biggest fucking geniuses alive, like
Frank Sherlock, hassen, Chris McCreary, their books, poems,
AND like a dozen other things!  I don't read novels because I'm
not on this planet to kill time, I read poetry because it FEEDS
me and keeps me growing up (I'm fifteen in the head by now,  hehe!)
and I want to sense Love at all its possible temperatures, etc.
And Bukowski SEES as best as any poet.  And I know we want
to wiggle and waggle over line breakage and how the fuck the
poem has grown out of the harpoon of the whaling boats of the
Great Poet Mothers and Fathers before us, but dammit this bit
down below is Bukowski fucking SEEING with beautiful clarity.
Yeah-yeah, maybe after the hangover wore off, but SEES!

Enough enough, here's an excerpt, like it or not.  But you  asked,
and thanks for asking, CAConrad
p.s. and by the way Joseph I ALWAYS mean it when I say Love,
so, yeah.
-------------

Born like this
Into this
As the chalk faces smile
As Mrs. Death  laughs
As the elevators break
As political landscapes dissolve
As the  supermarket bag boy holds a college degree
As the oily fish spit out their  oily prey
As the sun is masked
We are
Born like this
Into  this
Into these carefully mad wars
Into the sight of broken factory  windows of emptiness
Into bars where people no longer speak to each  other
Into fist fights that end as shootings and knifings
Born into  this
Into hospitals which are so expensive that it's cheaper to die
Into  lawyers who charge so much it's cheaper to plead guilty
Into a country where  the jails are full and the madhouses closed
Into a place where the masses  elevate fools into rich heroes
Born into this
Walking and living through  this
Dying because of this
Muted because of  this
Castrated
Debauched
Disinherited
Because of this
Fooled by  this
Used by this
Pissed on by this
Made crazy and sick by this
Made  violent
Made inhuman
By this
The heart is blackened
The fingers  reach for the throat
The gun
The knife
The bomb
The fingers reach  toward an unresponsive god
The fingers reach for the bottle
The  pill
The powder
We are born into this sorrowful deadliness
We are born  into a government 60 years in debt
That soon will be unable to even pay the  interest on that debt

>
>
> 1. About the Poetics List
>
> With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
> Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the list has
> about 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial number of
> nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web site (see
> archive URL above).
>
> The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
> for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
> those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
> renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
> questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
> otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
> While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
> exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep in mind
> the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect our
> decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support
> and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
> contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do what is
> necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.
>
> Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
> format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
> specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one: in
> most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the list,
> and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv editorial
> board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which calls for all
> messages to be read and approved before being forwarded to the list. We
> prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the spontaneity of discussion
> that we hope to promote. In addition to these options, the editorial
> board will unsubscribe individuals if they are not, in our opinion,
> productively contributing to the list or following our guidelines. We
> remain committed to this editorial function as a defining element of the
> Poetics List.
>
> Please also note that this is a private list and information about this
> list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The
> idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather than
> general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list relatively
> small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the list are
> generally 50 messages per day, and one or two messages per subscriber
> per day; but these limits are subject to change withouth notice.
>
> In addition to being archived at through the EPC
> (http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
> http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
> Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
> also become part of specific EPC subject areas.
>
> Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
> the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the EPC.
>
> 2. Posting to the List
>
> The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
> editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
> Welcome Message (see section 1).
>
> Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions
> of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
> activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. We strongly
> encourage subscribers to post information, including web links, relating
> to publications (print and internet), reading series, and blogs that
> they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear. Such
> announcements constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of
> poetry events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.
>
> We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
> discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
> venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal entries.
>
> Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
> discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
> subscribers.
>
> Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly to
> the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.
>
>
> 3. Subscriptions
>
> *For all subscription requests go to
> http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.
>
> *To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
> Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask

>
> *To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different

>
> Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal

> Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post will be

>
> The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
> your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
> messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
> automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
> generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
> bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
> process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
> future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the web.
>
> 4. Subscription Options
>
> We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the

>
> 5. To Unsubscribe
>
> To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
> strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
> http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also may

> <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics
>
> If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
> e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
> this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
> unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
> List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then
> resubscribe with your new email address.
>
> 6. Cautions
>
> "Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
> 'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
> insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racist,
> sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
> person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while critique
> of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main
> functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique or
> criticism of the person.
>
> The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
> discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
> listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.
>
> In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes competing
> interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with our
> collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.
>
> For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
> subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent
> in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
> HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
> individual posts to 1,000 words or less.
>
> Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
> the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for
> all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from
> this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's
> permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of
> published materials.
>
> All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
> before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that you
> get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
> permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
> appeared originally on the Poetics List
> (http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
> Used by permission of the author.
>
> As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
> from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
> (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
> fewer messages per day.
>
> Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
> message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see
> if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not
> posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to
> contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

I there any code dealing with what happens when you get gender-bent through
having an androgynous given name?

I ask this as one to whom this happens much of the time.

(Though I have to say that I'm rather proud of having once been [implicitly]
described as the only lesbian poet in the entire history of Scottish poetry.

Mind you, this was some time ago.)

[There is a slightly serious point to this -- my own experience seems to
suggest that sex and/or gender codings in at least transcribed language -- I
doubt this applies, at least so clearly, to "natural" speech --are much less
marked than is commonly thought.  I don't go out of my way to pass -- I just
naturally (?) assume I sound male -- so it rarely occurs to me that I might
be miss-sexed, but it does seems to happen.  Guessing, about 50% of the
time.  Do we all speak Basic Mercurian?     R.]

I am with dbc on this one, but also I should mention, I do not buy the notion of Buk as alkie, I mean with all he wrote who would have time to be a serious drinker? Seems dubious at best.

  I have thot the bigger problems with Buk was always how many said they were influenced by him, by his weaker writing, not misogeny, Mark W. The general misandry posed towards all (men are pigs if they say this (oh forgive this one he is gay! please!)) who voice an interest in buk is the problem. I also agree tho, & do not think there is a general characteristic or set of formative words to place the working class into. And Miekal, I disagree, the writers you mentioned are hard to find books of, even us in the most elite set of readers are not as well versed in bp nichol and da levy as we would hope to be let alone let them have the influence of one who is so easy to find.

This is one of the most beautifully designed and nicely put together
magazines that I've ever encountered.  The washi papers make each small
collection (which usually run to about 100 pages) a tactile delight.
Contents range from excellent to a cut above the usual--with a great
deal of attention given to experimental forms.  Collectors take note.
Highly recommended.  Jess

Actually, I've been keeping my ears open locally among the folks that
I work with to get a sense of their sense of poetry for the non-
poets, for the common person...  Asking around at a big party last
night, the universal consensus seemed to be that John Trudell was the
poet of their generation.  Not quite working class poetry, but not
someone whose name I've ever seen mentioned on this list.

i remember when i was first awakening to poetry's possibilities buying
bukowski's books and devouring them whole in french quarter coffee shops. i
loved the immediacy and energy of them. here's one that i remember liking
very much, from _play the piano drunk like a percussion instrument until
the fingers begin to bleed a bit_ (yes, anna, great title!) . . . an apple
as memento mori . . .

camille


apple

this is not just an apple
this is an experience
red green yellow
with underlying pits of white
wet with cold water
I bite into it
christ, a white doorway . . .

another bite
chewing
while thinking of an old witch
choking to death on an apple skin--
a childhood story.

I bite deeply
chew and swallow

there is a feeling of waterfalls
and endlessness

there is a mixture of electricity and
hope

yet now
halfway through the apple
some depressive feelings begin

it's ending
I'm working toward the core
afraid of seeds and stems

there's a funeral march beginning in Venice,
a dark old man has died after a lifetime of pain

I throw away the apple early
as a girl in a white dress walks by my window

followed by a boy half her size
in blue pants and striped shirt

I leave off a small belch
and stare at a dirty
ashtray

I have a pretty open mind when it comes to poetry--and

he's written many poems that haven't interested me too
much as poems, that is, on the level of language.

i used to teach trudell all the time; order his cassettes, etc.
maybe i shd start again.  he's more spoken word-type.  so it makes
sense that his name wouldn't come up a lot on the list...

But mIEKAL, is the person that attends the same party pretty likely to know
poetry at all, moreso than some other non-poetry-reading "common person"?
John Trudell has a pretty wide reputation as an activist, musician, and
poet, but it's a very specific reputation within specific local and
activist communities (at least that's my take, but I don't know him well &
you can certainly correct me). It still seems to me much more likely that
non-poets who are not generally involved with poetry are much more likely
to have heard about, and perhaps read, some Bukowski or Billy Collins or
Allen Ginsberg, than they are likely to have read Trudell or any poets
primarily active on their own local scene.

I think the idea of the local is apropos here, because for a lot of people
who ARE involved with poetry, their experience is primarily local, and,
working class or not, they are more likely to know (or have known,
depending on the specific time period) the work and person of a John
Tuschen in Madison Wisconsin (if they are there) or a Will Inman in Tucson
Arizona (if they are there), or any number of other names fairly specific
to local communities, and even to have a significant relation with that
poet's work, which helps usher them into a particular poetry scene (and
perhaps beyond that scene as well). In Tucson, for example, in the 1970's
through 1990's, I think it much more likely that someone would, without
much experience in poetry, have happened into a Will Inman reading or
workshop and gradually become involved in both their own poetry and Will's
and that of specific local others, than that they would have had experience
with either Bukowski or Collins. And Inman would more likely have led them
fairly quickly to Blake or Jeffers or Meridel LeSueur than to Bukowski or
Collins.

I'm speaking about SW Wisconsin where the cultural climate is
considerably different than in Madison.  Certainly folks out here
have heard of Ginsberg & Snyder & possibly Corso.  I would venture
that none of these imaginary non-poets have heard of Billy Collins or
Bukowski. You have to keep in mind that this area has had 3
generations of back to landers, & what little economy exists out here
is powerfully driven by green & eco-organic types.  We have the
largest concentration of organic farms in the country.  It's a pretty
unique profile of folks out here but still not all that culturally
diverse.

In Madison Bukowski seems to be a household word & its quite common
to find his books in the windows of used bookstores.  But this is
largely due to Tuschen & him bringing Corso, Burroughs, & some of the
baby Beats to town in the 80s.  But I would argue that the street
poetry ethos that has ruled the non-academic scene poetry scene in
Madison for 30 years or more isn't about reading books & knowing
poems.  It's about partying, having a good time & agitating against
the status quo.  It's really closer in alliance to slam & spoken word.

It is a terrible poem, really as if written by someone who
has never read a poem.

The inability to understand the difference between the use
of a comma and the going ahead without one, for example,
seems not to be understood (by writer and...?); i.e.--it is not
understood that a
comma is EQUAL to any other orthographic mark when it comes
to meaning and pace, etc.

Dear Poets of Canada,

I am interested in hearing from any Canadian Poet who is working in
collaboration with another poet on a project. I have recently been
engaged in one for the first time and I am amazed at the poetry and
ideas generated from it.

I want to propose to a few literary journals the idea of an issue
focused on "Canadian poets in collaboration." I am also the co-editor
of a journal out of UB called "Pilot" - our inaugural issue is coming
out this September and features, among others, the work of  Karen Mac
Cormack, Lisa Robertson, Rachel Zolf, Angela Szcepaniak, Geoffrey
Hlibchuk, and Derek Beaulieu. I would love to devote a portion of our
next issue to collaborative projects.

So please get back to me by May 31 at strudensky@gmail.com if you or
someone you know is engaging in a collaborative project or has
recently completed one and then I can make the proposal with
confidence.

Thanks and hope everyone is well.

Howdy David:

But isn't it a little interesting, perhaps even
ironic, how many men on this list have taken a moment
to disagree with me on whether gender issues in
Bukowski are one of the major problems of his writing?

If we all didn't know better, one might be tempted to
say that gender problems in contemporary poetry seem
to still be quite significant.

On the issue of the range possible in white working
class voices, I would strongly urge everyone to read
Jim Tully's 1924 autobiography Beggars of Life. It may
be the best book written on the subject of what it
means to be white, male, and poor in the United
States. Tully's insights into gender and race
issues--among a lot else--go to show exactly how aware
of these problems white working class men can be. Just
FYI, Tully became a homeless itinerant worker at the
age of 14, and learned to read by stealing books from
libraries. Beggars of Life, to my mind, is a better
book even than Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and
London.

  I have thot the bigger problems with Buk was always
how many said
they were influenced by him, by his weaker writing,
not misogeny, Mark W.
The general misandry posed towards all (men are pigs
if they say this
(oh forgive this one he is gay! please!)) who voice an
interest in buk
is the problem. I also agree tho, & do not think there
is a general
characteristic or set of formative words to place the
working class into.

That's some recommendation - although of course Orwell was slumming
it...I'll try to track it down.

Hotmail has been down since Gates' remarks to President Hu. Not surprisingly, it's back following FT article.

  http://news.ft.com/cms/s/7d186064-e1e2-11da-bf4c-0000779e2340.html

  "Foreigner men" come to make money, get girlfriends they can exploit and find for mothering and house keeping duties, along with racialized fucks--oh, and visas. Women, not unlike those middle class lasses seen in South America, often come for noblesse savage scews. Sad thing, but all involved benefit from this opportunistic relationship. Everyone knows what they are getting. Too bad, however, neither Tibetans or Kazaks or Uyghurs, or the myriad of minorities have much say in their choices.  Oh, to clarify, white folk do this, and do so with little concern (occupying a privilaged status), while often cursing places like Israel for its own mess.

  Art scene's the same, if honest, very different from freedom of Prague in 90s. We all know what we cannot say, which, to be honest, is most everything. So the bar is really low, as far as quality and what/who is being informed. See, everything goes back to the State, and these instruments of agency, born out of a quite different ideology, reinforce what is otherwise facade. To reinforce that what is happening behind this veneer is somehow as beneficial as what it entails outside the bubble.

  Just came back from West China, Xingjiang, and was a sad, and additional case of occupation, disortion, extra reaffirmations of what we already know (if honest), and that is that totalitarianism is a bad thing, and I'm thinking of the individual (because we can live in a community and still care about the one, less we are willing to suffer our own abridgement of rights with little gripe). Likewise, with all the aid, food around, billions Japan has lent, amount of money all these Chinese companies (too often State, which means the money goes you know where) there is really little excuse for why any of this obscenity should be tolerated or encouraged.

  I'm out for good in few days and feel both tense and relieved. It would be a big mistake, and my wife is from former Czechoslovakia, and, too, it would be a big mistake to minimize the barbarity of the Soviets, because only middle class elites from places like France, England, and the US mythologize their contribution to the war effort, to not be concerned about the dignity of the individual. And that is our tradition. And I could, realistically, go to jail for my rants (and how do I know this, because of the margins we occupy in this nation). Should the Kurds have a place, some plot on which to, well, simply be safe, or those who are oppressed here, or there, or elsewhere. I thought these arguements were already settled?

  It's all about the Olympics, face (mien), rising out of shadow and errors of thousands of years of fuedalism and Mao (the countries more successful and largely mythical warlord).

  I need some advice from everyone about a program I'm starting in India (Around Smurfland?! -- clearly this is coded). I don't much care about anyone's elitism or distain for me or my ideas, the way I communicate, how hotdog I might come across, but I would deeply and most sincerely appreciate your minds.

  Fact is, I went and am now going back.

  AJ

Mark, what exactly are the problems with Bukowski and gender?

He was NOT a misogynist.  The word misogynist is a very serious
word and not to be taken lightly.

HOW was he one?  Where do you read this?  What?   Where?

He never EVER beat women, never EVER mistreated women.
In fact every woman ever interviewed about him who was either
a lover or a friend has had nothing but great things to say!

Disagree with you?  Yes, I have to.  I'm COMPELLED to speak
out when I see someone being unfairly judged or mistreated.  It
comes with the territory of being a queer and constantly judged.

I have KNOWN misogynists, and they're scum.
And Bukowski was not one of them.  Not only did Bukowski
NOT beat women he also didn't talk down to them.

He Loved them!  Why are straight men crucified for liking
women I just don't get it!?  Can a healthy appetite for sex
actually be that bad?

And by the way he was also VERY supportive of women poets.
He was also published by women editors.  The editors of PEARL
MAGAZINE loved him, two women.

He was a loud guy Mark, and arrogant, but the profile doesn't
include these horrible judgments you make.

I'm a loud guy, why am I not a misogynist then?  Why, well maybe
because I'm NOT a misogynist, JUST LOUD!

AND BY THE WAY Mark, you say the "men" on this List, as though
you haven't noticed some "women" on this List who have some okay
things to say about Bukowski.  Why are YOU just singling out the
"men" on the List?

Don't the opinions of women count?  And here I thought you were
busy defending women.

Why am I always the queer defending straight guys?  It's so  fucking
weird I can't even believe it!

I'm GLAD I'M NOT A STRAIGHT GUY!  GEESH!  You can
be the nicest fucking guy on Earth and get called the WORST
POSSIBLE names just for liking sex and being LOUD!  OY!
And for LIKING beer!  Beer's great!  I fucking LOVE beer!   In my
neck of the woods we drink Yuengling, and it's wonderful, especially
with a nice rich cigarette!  And I live in a city where we can  still
smoke and drink INSIDE!  And they'll have to drag me out the  door
by my fucking hair if they ever ban either!

What a ridiculous country this is sometimes!  The government  does
NOTHING to DuPont for polluting the rivers and soil with chemicals,
Exxon has one of the WORST oil spills in history, and NEITHER
company pays a dime to clean it up.  But in some cities if you  light
up a cigarette in a bar (NOT a day-care mind you, but a bar!) you  get
a ticket for 200 dollars, AND thrown out onto the sidewalk without
being able to finish your delicious beer!  BASTARDS!

And as far as gender and poetry in general these days...

In Philadelphia there are just as many women writing as there are
men, and no one is treating anyone different for gender's sake.

There are a LOT of women writing poetry all over the place it seems,
AND editing magazines, presses, etc., as well as teaching poetry,
teaching creative writing.  One of my oldest friends teaches a  class
on Beat Women Poets in a women's prison in North Carolina, and
she says it's changing lives.

I'm not saying things are 100 percent everywhere, but if the genius
women poets in Philadelphia have anything to say about it, THIS
WORLD is going to MAKE ROOM DAMMIT!

All,

  Know that prior e-mail was sporadic in its observations and was written quickly. Thoughts zoom faster than typed text. Apologize.

  Project is a press and school for refugees. We've both admin, edu experience, are pulling together our own funds, but would MOST SINCERELY any suggests related to distribution, publishing, organizing submissions. The idea is to do this in the most cost effective manner without compromising integrity of intent.

As I recall, back in the 80s I had a cassette tape of John Trudell's
titled "But This Isn't El Salvador."

(Where did that go?)

Unlike the recitations with blues rock on his Ryko Disk release (still
thinking way back), the music that accompanied his poems on "But This
Isn't El Salvador" was more *indigenous*.

That is, if I'm remembering the name correctly.

I=B4m the daughter of the german poet and novelist Nicolas Born, who was =
strongly influenced by American Poets of the sixties and seventies and - =
togehter with Rolf Dieter Brinkmann - brought these influences to German =
contemporary 70s poetry. I reedited his poems two years ago with great =
success (Gedichte, Wallstein Verlag 2004, Price for best German poetry =
edition of 2004) and now am preparing an edition of his correspondence.=20
I am now looking for anybody still in posession of letters of Nicolas =
Born in the United States.=20
Born stayed at the University of Iowas International Writers Workshop in =
1969/1970 and was translated by Anselm Hollo, Eric Torgersen and others. =
He further corresponded and met with John Batki, Kenneth Koch, Charles =
Bukowski, Allan Ginsberg, Robert Creeley and others. Born translated =
among other works Kenneth Koch=B4s poems in German in the early =
seventies. And he edited a micro - anthology for Luchterhand Verlag with =
poems from Ashbury, Ron Padgett, Berrigan, Hollo and others. Born died =
in 1979 (Nicolas was his artists name, before 1965 he called himself =
Klaus J=FCrgen Born). I already contacted major archives (University of =
Connecticut, Stanford, Fraser, Washington U.).
I would be really thankful for any further advise, help, support of =
about where I could find my father=B4s letters. I=B4m also interested in =
anyone=B4s memories / impressions of Nicolas Born from his time in the =
States, in manuscripts he might have send, or other material.
Thanks,

hi alison

been trying to e-mail you but it keeps bouncing back saying your inbox is
full.

oh and to any others coincidentally i re-read bukowski recently after not
doing so for a long time. wonderful stories in so many ways but the gender
politics make your hair stand on end. I wouldn't conflate working class and
sexist. I belong to at least two social classes at the last count and
wouldn't distinguish between them in that respect, although their
expressions of it may be different.

the more privileged are generally better at keeping their mouth shut in
order to sustain their privilege. or working through laws, or constitutions
to keep power and control rather than someone like bukwoski shouting the
odds in the middle of the street. sly lot they are.

I think george oppen said something like that about class. don't you love
george oppen?

love to all

Philip Jenks & Jennifer Moxley
Friday, May 19, 2006 at 7:30 p.m.


Philip Jenks joins us in celebration of his second book, My First Painting
Will Be "The Accuser" (Zephyr Press), which has been nominated for an Oregon
Book Award. The Chicago Review described his earlier book, On the Cave You
Live In (Flood Editions), as: “Inspired speech recording its own fall into
dead letter [….] the poems of Philip Jenks are strange, original, terrifying.
A stuttered apocalypse, they affirm our fellowship with all matter while
suffering divinity’s perpetual departure from our midst.” Jenks grew up in
Morgantown, West Virginia and currently teaches at Portland State University
in Oregon.


Poet and translator Jennifer Moxley joins us from Maine in celebration of her
2005 book, Often Capital (Flood Editions). Poet Dale Smith writes of Moxley: “
She recharges old forms by dismantling the archaisms and replacing them with
her own uses of language. It’s lyric synthesis through a kind of dream
narrative, only that dream world brings with it real questions of how to live
here and now.” Moxley’s last book, The Sense Record (Edge Books, 2002),
received a Book of the Year Award from Small Press Traffic. Her other works
include Imagination Verses and Enlightenment Evidence.

Anyone who has seen old Buk on video knows that he drank heavily for much o=
f
his life. You can see it in his eyes, in the way he moves. He got lucky in
that he was a pretty functional drunk.

CA, I myself am finding this discussion quite useful.

Actually, I have not said that Bukowsksi was a
misogynist; I said that the representations of gender
in his books are a problem. I can so easily imagine
someone else calling him a misogynist that it doesn't
quite seem necessary for me to do that.

There's a difference between being interested in sex
and describing the women with whom you are involved
primarily or solely in terms of their sexual
attributes. His women characters on the whole are not
particularly interesting or memorable; they tend to be
shrill annoyances who appear and disappear along the
road of his narrators' self-journey to a kind of
romanticized down-and-outnesss that is as much hippie
fantasy as it is revealing discussion of the lives of
the poor and downtrodden. The female characters often
have nice asses and loud mouths and not much else.
Bukowski's descriptions of women strike me as closest
to the work of another poet and fiction writer, Jim
Harrison. Both of them share an obsession with a
certain highly male version of freedom; the ability to
come and go as they please without social constraints.
These constraints tend mainly to take two forms: the
wimpiness of male middle-class bureaucracies, and the
social demands of respectability and responsibility
placed upon them by women. Their most positive female
characters are the ones who are most like the male
main characters in seeing all sexual relationships as
being about temporary pleasure and the right to move
on when you're done with it; the most negative ones
are the ones who insist that the men stay put.
Interestingly, both Bukowski and Harrison finally rely
on metaphors of wilderness; Harrison's wilderness is
more literal (the woods of northern Michigan) while
Bukowski's wilderness is more that of the neon jungle.
Life is a wilderness full of dangers in which the male
character is constantly risking his soul but manages
to maintain it by not giving in to the artificiality
and heartbreak of human ties.

The idea of freedom in the wilderness has a long and
complicated history in American literature; Thoreau,
Hucklebery Finn, Hemingway, many others. I find it all
interesting, but I think it's also fair to say that
the terms it uses can be questioned. That's what I'm
trying to do: I'm NOT trying to call anybody names.

As to the question of his loving women, well, who
knows. It's not the fact OF loving them that counts, I
would say, but HOW one goes about it that's at stake.
I'm not talking about what he did or didn't do in his
personal life (are you in possession of that
information?), I'm talking about the issue as it
appears in his books.

About the women who have responded saying that they
liked Bukowski: of course women can like Bukowski's
work, especially (as some of them suggested) if
exposed to it at a time in their lives when Bukowski's
romanticism seems most appealing. But I didn't see
that any of the women who wrote in saying they liked
Bukowski denied that gender was a problem in his work,
because obviously it's a problem. One might like his
work anyway.

I do think it's kind of you to point out that loud,
large, white heterosexual males can also be
stereotyped unfairly. Speaking as a large heterosexual
male myself, one who grew up good at playing sports
and who spent a lot of time camping in the wilderness,
and who likes beer and bars quite a bit, I appreciate
the gesture. But you don't do us any favors by saying
that because some men like those things, our attitudes
towards gender must either be predictable,
understandable, or excusable. If you want to give us a
break, please assume that even though we might be
large and loud and heterosexual, it might also be true
that we're capable of understanding (or at least
trying to understand) the world we live in.

Keep blasting away, my friend.

Subject: Re: Bukowski and gender


Mark, what exactly are the problems with Bukowski and
gender?

He was NOT a misogynist.  The word misogynist is a
very serious
word and not to be taken lightly.

HOW was he one?  Where do you read this?  What?
Where?

He never EVER beat women, never EVER mistreated women.
In fact every woman ever interviewed about him who was
either
a lover or a friend has had nothing but great things
to say!

Disagree with you?  Yes, I have to.  I'm COMPELLED to
speak
out when I see someone being unfairly judged or
mistreated.  It
comes with the territory of being a queer and
constantly judged.

I have KNOWN misogynists, and they're scum.
And Bukowski was not one of them.  Not only did
Bukowski
NOT beat women he also didn't talk down to them.

He Loved them!  Why are straight men crucified for
liking
women I just don't get it!?  Can a healthy appetite
for sex
actually be that bad?

And by the way he was also VERY supportive of women
poets.
He was also published by women editors.  The editors
of PEARL
MAGAZINE loved him, two women.

He was a loud guy Mark, and arrogant, but the profile
doesn't
include these horrible judgments you make.

I'm a loud guy, why am I not a misogynist then?  Why,
well maybe
because I'm NOT a misogynist, JUST LOUD!

AND BY THE WAY Mark, you say the "men" on this List,
as though
you haven't noticed some "women" on this List who have
some okay
things to say about Bukowski.  Why are YOU just
singling out the
"men" on the List?

Don't the opinions of women count?  And here I thought
you were
busy defending women.

Why am I always the queer defending straight guys?
It's so  fucking
weird I can't even believe it!

I'm GLAD I'M NOT A STRAIGHT GUY!  GEESH!  You can
be the nicest fucking guy on Earth and get called the
WORST
POSSIBLE names just for liking sex and being LOUD!
OY!
And for LIKING beer!  Beer's great!  I fucking LOVE
beer!   In my
neck of the woods we drink Yuengling, and it's
wonderful, especially
with a nice rich cigarette!  And I live in a city
where we can  still
smoke and drink INSIDE!  And they'll have to drag me
out the  door
by my fucking hair if they ever ban either!

What a ridiculous country this is sometimes!  The
government  does
NOTHING to DuPont for polluting the rivers and soil
with chemicals,
Exxon has one of the WORST oil spills in history, and
NEITHER
company pays a dime to clean it up.  But in some
cities if you  light
up a cigarette in a bar (NOT a day-care mind you, but
a bar!) you  get
a ticket for 200 dollars, AND thrown out onto the
sidewalk without
being able to finish your delicious beer!  BASTARDS!

I like that in this last paragraph you start to bring yourself in.
Feel free to take this opportunity for further, uh, self-promotion
(don't worry, it doesn't have to be SHAMELESS self-promotion!)
and maybe include an excerpt of your 'creative' prose in which
you address some of this issues/feelings/actions less as a critic of another

It can be 'self-criticism' if you wish. thanks, Chris

Teacher apologizes for murder essay request

http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/05/15/teacher.apologizes.ap/index.html


Monday, May 15, 2006; Posted: 8:11 a.m. EDT (12:11 GMT)

ST. JOSEPH, Missouri (AP) -- A high school teacher has apologized for
asking students to write about who they would kill and how they would
do it, and officials said he will likely keep his job.

Michael Maxwell, who teaches industrial technology at Central High
School, said his request that students in his beginning drafting
class describe how they would carry out a murder was merely a writing
prompt. It was not clear why he asked the drafting class to write
fiction.

"I made a horrible mistake that I regret," Maxwell said. "I want to
apologize to my students, my colleagues and to the community."

The April 21 writing request, which Maxwell said was not a formal
assignment, came to the attention of administrators when a parent of
one of the students filed a complaint with Principal Barton Albright.

Albright expressed regret and apologized for Maxwell's "lapse of
judgment."

"He's an exemplary person ... this is very out of character," the
principal said.

St. Joseph School District spokesman Steve Huff declined to discuss
possible disciplinary measures because the matter is considered a
personnel issue. But he said the incident probably isn't serious
enough to cost Maxwell his job.

About 25 to 30 students from ninth through 12th grades were in the
class, Albright said.

Dear Chris,

It is with extreme reluctance that I take up cudgels on Mark Wallace's
behalf, lest I be seen as biased on these key issues, but I must in the
end testify on behalf of my former colleague and brother poet. I
couldn't help but notice that you've put scare quotes around his
self-descriptors. During my teaching stint at GW -- I now teach in far
more working-class environs, which frankly isn't all that difficult -- I
shared an office with Mr. Wallace. I can assure you that he is indeed:

1. Male. If he is a FtM and thus genetically female, allow me to assure
you that he's passing very, very successfully, because he really is:
2. Large. Again, it doesn't take much to outdo me in the height
department, but Mark must be a good foot taller than I am. The
normally-sized chairs in the office didn't seem to fit him that well.
3. Then there's the issue of his heterosexuality. He didn't hit on me,
but boy, was my mystical, magical straight-dar going off.

And loud? Oy veh is mir, was this guy loud. He was constantly galumphing
up and down the corridors screaming, I mean SCREAMING, poetry at the top
of his lungs. He would slam open the door of the office, drop about 50

I hope you do track down Tully's book, Alison. It
really is worth it.

I'm not an expert on Orwell; is it absolutely clear
that he made a purposeful decision to live in the kind
of poverty he describes in Down And Out? To some
extent, the book itself suggests otherwise, but I've
always wondered.

That's some recommendation - although of course Orwell
was slumming
it...I'll try to track it down.

Teacher apologizes for murder essay request

http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/05/15/teacher.apologizes.ap/index.html

ST. JOSEPH, Missouri (AP) -- A high school teacher has apologized for
asking students to write about who they would kill and how they would
do it, and officials said he will likely keep his job.

Michael Maxwell, who teaches industrial technology at Central High
School, said his request that students in his beginning drafting
class describe how they would carry out a murder was merely a writing
prompt. It was not clear why he asked the drafting class to write
fiction.

"I made a horrible mistake that I regret," Maxwell said. "I want to
apologize to my students, my colleagues and to the community."

The April 21 writing request, which Maxwell said was not a formal
assignment, came to the attention of administrators when a parent of
one of the students filed a complaint with Principal Barton Albright.

Albright expressed regret and apologized for Maxwell's "lapse of
judgment."

"He's an exemplary person ... this is very out of character," the
principal said.

St. Joseph School District spokesman Steve Huff declined to discuss
possible disciplinary measures because the matter is considered a
personnel issue. But he said the incident probably isn't serious
enough to cost Maxwell his job.

About 25 to 30 students from ninth through 12th grades were in the
class, Albright said.

     The only problem I can see with the assignment is that since it's for a
drafting class, why isn' the teacher asking that the essay be accompanied by
some lay out work showing the sites and their dimensions and how they will
be used for the murders.

Ironically, Rumsfeld and the Pentagon tell us with great frequency how,
without apologym they routinely prepare contingency plans - creative writing
exercises, as they must be - for either the invasion and/or bombing of  x,y
and z countries, plans which inevitably include kill (murder) ratios.

Military planners obviously get training in how to produce these operational
plans - fictitious or not. I don't think it should surprise us -
embarrassing as it might sound - that such planning might come up in the
context of a classroom or, possibly, eventually  become an acceptable part
of the curriculum. It's been a very active part of this regime's culture for
the last six years.

Over the weekend I  - and fellow members in a classic's group - read
Euripides' The Trojan Woman. A play, I think, highly applicable to the
implosion of values taking place in this country the pre-emptive invasions
of Iraq and Afghanistan - including the demolition of other cultures, the
institution of torture as practice, universal domestic surveillance, etc.,
etc.  Obviously it's getting time to Nuke Iran!  But wow, what a powerful
play - which I think last saw a big New York run during the early seventies
and the war on Viet Nam.

With these great and optimistic notes,

I once knew an instructor who gave an assignment to his Freshman Comp class
that consisted of writing a letter to his (the instructor's) ex-girlfriend,
asking her to go out with them. They were also given her address and told t=
o
mail the letters. There was a serious grievance put forth by a very angry
ex.

When I was in high school back in 1749, an honors English course, the
teacher gave us a set of imaginative composition prompts.  I chose "How
I Murdered the Family."  I hadn't done that and it didn't even give me
any ideas.  It was the lamest paper I ever wrote because it was too much
of a stretch...which is precisely what these twitty post-Columbinians
cannot comprehend: imagination.  Nobody complained, called the
newspapers, cops, or Dr. Phil.  Nobody got their job waved in their
face.  Homeland Security didn't come to the school and McCarthy's ghost
did not appear on the battlements.  Actually this happened in  1959, not
1749 (duh), but it still was a much different time, even in New York City.

This was the same era when another English teacher, Jeannette Zansky,
tried to define for us the difference between good and great: Hitler and
Stalin were not good, but they were great in the sense they towered over
their age.

Nobody hung her out to dry either.

Yes; Orwell was an English middle class child and went to the requisite
public schools, including Eton; Orwell saw them as training camps for the
administrators of the British Empire. When he finished school he went to
South East Asia and was a police officer in Burma. Sometime after that he
decided to be a writer, violently rejecting the career path laid out for
him. His living as a tramp, as in The Spike, was really a kind of extended
journalism, the idea that he had to live in those conditions in order to
understand what they were. I suppose he was probably the first person to do
that kind of thing.

Aside from the precision of his prose, a large part of the reason I value
Orwell (who has also a certain bias about women) is the harsh honesty of hi=
s
self assessments, which makes him a very illuminating commentator on things
like British colonialism or the covert anti-Semitism in Britain. This quote=
,
from "Shooting an Elephant", about an incident in Burma, is not untypical.

...In the end the sneering yellow faces of young men that met me everywhere=
,
the insults hooted after me when I was at a safe distance, got badly on my
nerves. The young Buddhist priests were the worst of all. There were severa=
l
thousands of them in the town and none of them seemed to have anything to d=
o
except stand on street corners and jeer at Europeans.

All this was perplexing and upsetting. For at that time I had already made
up my mind that imperialism was an evil thing and the sooner I chucked up m=
y
job and got out of it the better. Theoretically =AD and secretly, of course =AD
I was all for the Burmese and all against their oppressors, the British. As
for the job I was doing, I hated it more bitterly than I can perhaps make
clear. In a job like that you see the dirty work of Empire at close
quarters. The wretched prisoners huddling in the stinking cages of the
lock-ups, the grey, cowed faces of the long-term convicts, the scarred
buttocks of the men who had been Bogged with bamboos =AD all these oppressed
me with an intolerable sense of guilt. But I could get nothing into
perspective. I was young and ill-educated and I had had to think out my
problems in the utter silence that is imposed on every Englishman in the
East. I did not even know that the British Empire is dying, still less did =
I
know that it is a great deal better than the younger empires that are going
to supplant it. All I knew was that I was stuck between my hatred of the
empire I served and my rage against the evil-spirited little beasts who
tried to make my job impossible. With one part of my mind I thought of the
British Raj as an unbreakable tyranny, as something clamped down, in saecul=
a
saeculorum, upon the will of prostrate peoples; with another part I thought
that the greatest joy in the world would be to drive a bayonet into a
Buddhist priest's guts. Feelings like these are the normal by-products of
imperialism; ask any Anglo-Indian official, if you can catch him off duty.

ANOTHER FUTURE:
POETRY AND ART IN A POSTMODERN TWILIGHT
by Alan Gilbert
http://www.upne.com/0-8195-6783-3.html

At the dawn of the 21st century, artists, poets, and scholars may find
themselves scratching their heads and wondering, what is next for
contemporary art? How do we think about poetry and visual art in the
wake of postmodernism? Alan Gilbert begins to answer these questions
in ANOTHER FUTURE: POETRY AND ART IN A POSTMODERN TWILIGHT, which
brings together a number of his critical writings.

Susan Howe describes the book as "lively and direct" and "impressive
in its clarity and focus." She continues: "It represents a new spirit
in American artistic theory and practice." Gilbert does indeed take
new approaches to critical unity and finds ways to examine a wide
array of art and poetry to show how they can be understood as
belonging to the same cultural moment.

Themes of particular interest to Gilbert include how a number of poets
and artists have conveyed a documentary impulse in their work; the
hybridity of culture; and the importance of a sense of "place" in
works of art. ANOTHER FUTURE should be a valuable asset to students
and teachers of art and poetry who are looking to transcend the
culture wars.

ANOTHER FUTURE looks at a host of authors, artists, and topics, many
of which have been overlooked in the past, including the Barbie
Liberation Organization, Anne Waldman, David LaChappelle, Mark Nowak,
"post-black" art, and many more.

Alan Gilbert is an independent scholar and poet who has published
extensively in journals and magazines on topics relating to poetry and
art. He has taught at the Brecht Forum and the Naropa University
Summer Writing Program, and has been a visiting artist/guest lecturer
at several universities.

This was an 'industrial drafting' class, right. While I am way down chez
noir, my associational/spatial senses take a syntactical leap back to Abu
Graib. In particular the famous picture of contraption of the box with the
hooded prisoner atop, arms outstretched, and the connecting wires, etc. - I
am taken with the thought that the American servicemen who devised this
contraption - as amateur as it seemed - possibly had a vocational high
school introductory class in  'industrial drafting' with possibly
challenging, creative exercises, as such.  I remembering taking such a clas=
s
when it was still part of a college prep curriculum in California,
particularly if you wanted to go into engineering. "Murder" plots never
crossed our T-Squares, but we were definitely OG in terms of today's virtua=
l
video world inclusive of murders by the click. Tho the Lawrence Rad lab wel=
l
lit nighttime dome in Berkeley and Manhattan project memories of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki were not far away.

By the way, if you are in the Bay Area, SFMOMA's major Shomei Tomatsu show
(the Japanese photographer who's work explores the tissues of post-Japan wa=
r
Japan under US Occupation) is unnerving and spectacular - particularly the
world of the fifties and sixties.  It is also the last week of the
surrealist photography show which also is wonderful and a clich=E9 buster if
you think it will be predictable stuff.

communicated with Washington officials in the hope of removing that
threat. Let us hope that Ahmadinejad's effort doesn't result in the
equally traditional outright US rejection.

Under the apparently hopeful belief that it was all a misunderstanding,
that the United States was not really intent upon crushing them and
their movements for social change, the Guatemalan foreign minister in
1954, President Cheddi Jagan of British Guiana in 1961, and Maurice
Bishop, leader of Grenada, in 1983 all made their appeals to be left in
peace, Jagan doing so at the White House in a talk with President John
F. Kennedy.(1) All were crushed anyhow. In 1961, Che Guevara offered a
Kennedy aide several important Cuban concessions if Washington would
call off the dogs of war. To no avail.(2)

In 2002, before the coup in Venezuela that ousted Hugo Chavez, some of
the plotters went to Washington to get a green light from the Bush
administration. Chavez learned of this visit and was so distressed by it
that he sent officials from his government to plead his own case in
Washington. The success of this endeavor can be judged by the fact that
the coup took place soon thereafter.(3)

Shortly before the US invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Iraqi officials,
including the chief of the Iraqi Intelligence Service, informed
Washington, through a Lebanese-American businessman, that they wanted
the United States to know that Iraq no longer had weapons of mass
destruction, and they offered to allow American troops and experts and
"2000 FBI agents" to conduct a search. The Iraqis also offered to hand
over a man accused of being involved in the World Trade Center bombing
in 1993 who was being held in Baghdad. The Iraqis, moreover, pledged to
hold UN-supervised free elections; surely free elections is something
the United States believes in, the Iraqis reasoned, and will be moved
by. They also offered full support for any US plan in the Arab-Israeli
peace process. "If this is about oil," said the intelligence official,
"we will talk about US oil concessions." These proposals were portrayed
by the Iraqi officials as having the approval of President Saddam
Hussein.(NYT
11-6-03) The United States completely ignored these overtures.

The above incidents reflect Third World leaders apparent belief that the
United States was open to negotiation, to discussion, to being
reasonable. Undoubtedly, fear and desperation played a major role in
producing this mental state, but also perhaps the mystique of America,
which has captured the world's heart and imagination for two centuries.
In 1945 and 1946, Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh wrote at least eight
letters to US President Harry Truman and the State Department asking for
America's help in winning Vietnamese independence from the French. He
wrote that world peace was being endangered by French efforts to
reconquer Indochina and he requested that "the four powers" (US, Soviet
Union, China, and Great Britain) intervene in order to mediate a fair
settlement and bring the Indochinese issue before the United Nations.(4)
This was a remarkable repeat of history. In 1919, at the Versailles
Peace Conference following the First World War, Ho Chi Minh had appealed
to US  Secretary of State Robert Lansing (uncle of Allen Dulles and John
Foster Dulles, whom Lansing appointed to the US delegation) for
America's help in achieving basic civil liberties and an improvement in
the living conditions for the colonial subjects of French Indochina. His
plea was ignored.(5) His pleas following the Second World War were
likewise ignored, with consequences for Vietnam, the rest of Indochina,
and the United States we all know only too well. Ho Chi Minh's pleas
were ignored because he was, after all, some sort of communist; yet he
and his Vietminh followers had in fact been long-time admirers of the
United States. Ho trusted the United States more than he did the Soviet
Union and reportedly had a picture of George Washington and a copy of
the American Declaration of Independence on his desk. According to a
former American intelligence officer, Ho sought his advice on framing
the Vietminh's own declaration of independence. The actual declaration
of 1945 begins:
"All men are created equal. They are endowed by their creator with
certain inalienable rights, among these are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness."(6)

Now comes the president of Iran with a lengthy personal letter to
President Bush. It has the same purpose as the communications mentioned
above: to dissuade the American pit bull from attacking and destroying,
from adding to the level of suffering in this sad old world. But if the
White House has already decided upon an attack, Ahmadinejad's letter
will have no effect. Was there anything Czechoslovakia could have done
to prevent a Nazi invasion in 1938? Or Poland in 1939?

"For sometime now I have been thinking, how one can justify the
undeniable contradictions that exist in the international arena -- which
are being constantly debated, especially in political forums and amongst
university students.... Young people, university students, and ordinary
people have many questions about the phenomenon of Israel. I am sure you
are familiar with some of them.... am sure you know how -- and at what
cost -- Israel was established: - Many thousands were killed in the
process.- Millions of indigenous people were made refugees....This
tragedy is not exclusive to the time of establishment; unfortunately it
has been ongoing for sixty years now. A regime has been established
which does not show mercy even to kids, destroys houses while the
occupants are still in them, announces before hand its list and plans to
assassinate Palestinian figures, and keeps thousands of Palestinians in
prison. Such a phenomenon is unique -- or at the very least extremely
rare -- in recent memory.... The people will scrutinize our
presidencies. Did we (manage) to bring peace, security and prosperity
for the people or insecurity and unemployment? Did we intend to
establish justice or just supported (special) interest groups, and by
forcing many people to live in poverty and hardship, made a few people
rich and powerful -- thus trading the approval of the people and the
almighty with theirs? Did we defend the rights of the underprivileged or
ignore them? Did we defend the rights of all people around t he world or
imposed wars on them, interfered illegally in their affairs, established
hellish prisons and incarcerated some of them? Did we bring the world
peace and security or raised the specter of intimidation and threats? "

Hank Shocklee: Louder than a Bomb
By Jim Welte, MP3.com
April 20, 2006 at 10:51:00 AM | more stories by this author

With a book and a sci-fi audio-visual project on the way, the creator of
the Public Enemy sound is putting in work.

 From the moment he sat down with MP3.com for a chat, it was clear that
Hank Shocklee was ready to bring the noise.
Hank Shocklee at work

Hank Shocklee at work

As cofounder of Public Enemy and creator of the Bomb Squad beats that
propelled dozens of sonic bombs, from "Fight the Power" and "Bring the
Noise" to "Welcome to the Terrordome," Shocklee invented the sound that
defined an era and served as the backdrop for Spike Lee's seminal Do the
Right Thing.

Shocklee has been away from the game for a while, having served stints
as a soundtrack producer (Juice, He Got Game) and a record exec (Universal).

But that doesn't mean the 40-year-old Shocklee has retired from the game.

He's just on a different vibe right now.

As head of Shocklee Entertainment, he's writing a book on the making of
It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, PE's second album that
almost started a revolution.

He's also working on an audiovisual sci-fi project called Shocktronica,
listening to lots of drum and bass and, not surprisingly, eschewing much
of today's mainstream hip-hop. He also hasn't yet heard the latest album
from Chuck D and company.

Here's MP3.com's lengthy interview with Hank Shocklee.

MP3.com: So, let's start off with talking about what you're up to these
days. It sounds like you have a number of things cooking, one of which
is the book about the making of Public Enemy's It Takes a Nation of
Millions to Hold Us Back.
The album that defined PE's sound.

The album that defined PE's sound.

Hank Shocklee: Yeah, that's going very well right now. It'll be out next
year. I'm approaching the book from a different angle, looking at the
whole philosophy and reason for making the band, what everyone's role
was and how the whole thing came together. It was different from any
musical group on the planet.

MP3: How so?

HS: With PE, we got together as a DJ group, and when we crossed over
into doing records, we adopted a whole new philosophy. I wanted to do a
personal experiment to see whether you can create something that
inspires, teaches, and connects with people on a multi-dimensional
level, not just with sight and sound but with also with also vibrations
and feelings and emotions and things of that nature.

I think we succeeded, because even 20 years later, people come up to me
to tell me that our music changed their lives in a deep way.

MP3: That's right, we're almost at the 20th anniversary of It Takes a
Nation of Millions.

HS: Yeah, isn't that crazy? Time flies, man. And that means that the
second generation of hip-hop will be celebrating its 20th soon. I'm not
talking about the early years. Those guys were doing something that had
never been done before. They were basically like, "We have no clue what
the f*** we're doing, but this feels good and we should keep it going."

I'm talking about the second generation, like Run DMC, Rakim, Slick
Rick, Salt-N-Pepa, Biz Markie, Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince, and PE.
That's when hip-hop found its voice and got its personality and started
to reach that superstar level. That was like the Marvel Comics of
hip-hop, where there were so many characters on the scene.

MP3: I'm curious if you think that a record like It Takes a Nation of
Millions could get made today. From a sampling standpoint, a record like
that with so many samples in it would cost a fortune today in licensing
fees, and politically, major label artists these days seem less willing
to take chances.
Bringin' the noise.

Bringin' the noise.

HS: Yeah, that second generation of hip-hop came before the sampling
crackdown. The laws of sampling need to be brought in check and
standardized, because it stems from a lack of understanding and it's
leading to greed.

Sampling was so different back then. The sound of that time was a direct
reflection of where you took your samples from. Marley Marl gets the
almighty respect because he changed the game prior to that by sampling
the kick and the snare [drum] from a record. That gave his sound a whole
unique tone, because before then, everybody had pretty much the same
sound. So then it was like, well if he took the kick and the snare, why
can't I take the guitar riffs too?

At that point, I looked at the landscape and said, "Oh, I see where this
is going. I have a s*** load of records." From then, I just wanted to
take the sampling and OD [overdose] on it. You know, I wanted to use it
so much that you didn't know what anything was and where things was
coming from.

And there was this sonic resonance that I wanted to hear throughout the
record, bringing in noise from everywhere. I felt like I had to make
records that superseded everything on the marketplace at that moment.
Otherwise nobody was going to even take any kind of notice.

MP3: Because you guys didn't already have an established fan base in one
of the boroughs, say with KRS in the Bronx or BIG in Brooklyn?

HS: Yeah, that was the premise of our existence. We just had to break
into the game.

MP3: What kind of music are you making these days? We don't see you out
there in the mainstream.

HS: The thing is, what got me involved in hip-hop was its
alternativeness. Hip-hop was the alternative music life back then. But
now, hip-hop is the mainstream. So, now, it incorporates all the
mainstream elements. It's more homogenous. There are more harmonies.
There's singing. To me, there's nothing insightful about making a
Christina Aguilera record or a Ja Rule record.

MP3: So you've stayed away from mainstream music because of how
formulaic it is?

HS: Exactly. No matter how you do it, as long as you conform to the
melody of the song, it's going to work. That's not what I'm looking for.
I'm working on an electronic, sci-fi, audiovisual project right now.

MP3: Really? I'd read a quote from you a while back to the effect of, "I
don't want to make music that you listen to. I want to make records that
move you." Is that what we're talking about here?

HS: Yeah, definitely. I'm creating a record that you can watch--a record
that you can put on that allows you to take the experience to another
level. When you listen to a record, you've got to visualize what's going
on. That's cool, you know, but I've always been a visual person. So,
musically, I want to be able to show you images that give you that extra
excitement.

And then there's the music. Since we can now all carry around 8,000
records with us, what's new? What's the next phase? What I'm developing
is called Shocktronica. It's designed to make you think. It's designed
to make you feel.

I'm dealing with frequencies that are rhythmic and will keep you in the
groove but will also have the appeal of a soundtrack or a score.

I'm doing this thing called subsonic frequencies, which is all about
fear, allowing you to feel the emotion that's involved in it.

For me, music is moving into another zone, which allows you to
participate on a more intellectual and physiological and psychological
level. I'm talking about psychedelic, '60s kind of operation but with a
2006-2007 kind of feel to it. It's called Subsonic Frequencies.

MP3: It'll be a DVD?

HS: Yeah, or an enhanced CD with visuals. And I would definitely want to
get it out to the video iPods as well. It'll be out late this year.

MP3: You're an iPod guy?

HS: I tell you, the iPod has to be one of the most incredible inventions
of the last 20 years. People don't even understand how revolutionary it
is unless they actually were a DJ and tried to carry 300 records around
on their back. We used to have to carry seven, eight crates to every gig.

Now you've got situations where you can carry 60-80 [GBs] of music, like
10,000-15,000 records. You could change records up every one minute and
you could be doing the gig for 25 hours and never play the same record
again twice. It is just so amazing right now.

MP3: What are you feeling out there these days? What are you listening to?

HS: I've been listening to a lot of drum and bass, even though all these
"experts" are saying that drum and bass, jungle, two-step, that that
music is over. Music comes in waves. It peeks its head up and then it
sees what's happening out here and then it finds out, "OK, the people
are not ready for it yet." Then it goes back underground and just starts
brewing again. It doesn't disappear. It's going to come back up again.
Hell, rap was supposed to have been dead in '87.

And I'm also into a lot of eclectic electronic music too. But there's so
much music out right now from all over the world, from Brazil and Spain
and Cuba, all over the place. I've heard stuff where Nigerian rhythms
and juju music are put together with hip-hop.

And to me what's even hotter than anything is music with no genre. It's
like, "Don't even f***ing tell me what this sh** is. Just let me put it
on and let me vibe to it." I think that the day is gone where everybody
is on one vibration.

I'll even put on some classical shit and be like, "I'm vibing to some
Rachmaninoff right now. You know what I'm saying?" We're moving away
from the style police where everybody's got to sit there and follow one
mode. That's dead.

MP3: I'm curious where you think hip-hop will be in 10 to 15 years. Do
you think that some of this creative kind of multigenre, you know, stuff
that's coming from all over the place will bubble to the surface, or
will this formulaic homogenization continue?

HS: No, we're heading in the direction of musical freedom, I believe
that. Part of the reason is that the hip-hop generation is growing up,
and it's feeling a lot of different kinds of music that might not be
what's on the radio. Each artist is going to sell a lot less now, so
those superstar ranks will diminish.

MP3: So that means more music will be popular among a critical mass of
consumers?

HS: Exactly. There's going to be less for everybody but it's going to be
better because now the cream is going to have to rise to the top in
order for you to get to that level. And so when you do get to that level
it's going to be because you truly earned it.

MP3: Before we let you go, what are your thoughts on the new PE record
that was written and produced by Paris?

HS: You know something, it's funny. I've never even heard it.

MP3: Really?

HS: It's like everybody's keeping it from me for some reason. Nobody
will give it to me.

MP3: Interesting. Well, a lot of people are saying that he lit a fire
under them a little bit.

HS: It doesn't take a genius to do that, to be honest. It's because
Chuck finally gave up the reins a bit. That was one of my biggest qualms
with that situation. Chuck is a great guy. But from a musical
standpoint, he's not like the greatest musical person. But he's been
like controlling and doing all the records ever since Apocalypse. And I
think ever since then he's been making records that have been substandard.
Chuck D and Hank Shocklee

Chuck D and Hank Shocklee

But the bigger issue is that PE wasn't just a sound, it was also a
philosophy and a mission. No disrespect to Paris or anybody who has
written or who was on the record. I look out there on the streets, man,
and I'm asking, "Is anybody even dealing with these issues?" I think
that it's been reduced to the music just being music.

MP3: Are you guys still in touch, you and Chuck and Flav?

HS: I still see Chuck, and I still speak to Flav when I see him.
Everybody's older now. I think that people are more interested right now
in maintaining their "existence," as to trying to do something new or to
change the climate. What I'm not seeing is anybody taking their power
and using it for the betterment of changing the environment.

It's like we can all go out here and make millions of dollars but can we
do anything of any substance? Can we change anybody's lives? Can we make
this world a better place? And I know that sounds idealist, but we don't
live in a vacuum. It doesn't matter how much money you've made.

MP3: So too many people are just looking to maintain their existence,
like with Flav doing the reality show and all that stuff, but no one
looking to "Fight the Power," so to speak?
Flavor Flav's reality show, <em>Flavor of Love</em>

Flavor Flav's reality show, Flavor of Love

HS: Yeah, but I'm not saying that you shouldn't [make your money]. But
we're lucky enough to be able to make a living doing what we do, and we
owe it to try and do something more than that. The voice of hip-hop used
to have this tremendous strength of change and consciousness.

You know, Kanye is the only one that's saying anything of any relevance,
and he speaks out of both sides of his mouth at the same time. I'm not
downing this kid, all right? He's the one that's got the most amount of
balls out of everybody that's out there. So I've got to give him the
torch. But who's mentoring him?

Some of these cats, they're only commodity is that they're known and
famous. That's not a commodity. What do you do?

If you're Puffy, what do you do? Don't tell me that you make clothes
because you don't make the clothes--you license your name. And he
learned that from Russell [Simmons], because that's all Russell's career
was, licenses and name. That's why Russell has no real power.

Everybody is good in their own right, but it's those special people who
can go above and beyond so that when you listen to their creativity,
their creativity is backed by their word, which you know that their word
means something because you'd know the things that they stand for.

I'm looking at this world now, and I'm saying, "OK, guys, you've made it
now. How much more do you need to make it?"

Look at Mel Gibson. Whether you agree him or whatever, the cat is saying
something with his art and his money.

MP3: It gets back to the fact that PE really stood for something that
made people stop and think.

HS: Exactly. That's one of the reasons why I'm doing this book, because
it's the philosophy that makes it important, not just the music. We're
supposed to be living a righteous life, a positive life, and then all
the art is going to amplify that.

MP3: Words to live by from Hank Shocklee. Thanks a lot for the time.
It's been a pleasure.

HS: Thank you very much.

Gov'ts are self-serving, not unlike most (everyone)--dog-eat-dog, as Creeley would have said, and did. And it takes little effort to appreciate the intent of your offering, or the suffering of others (especially if you've traveled as extensively as one might, or worked in refugee camps and seen despair as a kind of meal leading to grave discomfort and disillusionment), and especially if you're of color/minority and acutely know something about disempowerment. One cannot ignore, I would submit, the realities of the Cold War--which to any Pole or Czech was a really bad reality (especially following Hitler and great Europe's capitulation). Nor the game of power and politics, and I'm not justifying anyhow's behavior. It wouldn't be so painful, I think, to those of us who've pondered, if we didn't know so much about the media/television/information age's greatest star. It's easier to chat up, as they say, all those other places, little and big, most people know nada about. One
 thing I tend not to appreciate about such discussions are the inconsistencies ever apparent in such arguements. The US is many things, which, I think, is most important to remember (like everyone).

Mark, want to make clear first I took the liberty of saying  "misogyny"
due to the references you made in one of your original posts in which
you DO conflate violence against women with Bukowski.  Even if  you
believe you didn't mean to.  THAT made MY hair stand on end.

Hmm, to your last paragraph though, I really did think I was making
a point that some of the most sensitive people I've ever met are
straight guys.  And the LOUD was geared toward Bukowski, in that
particular sense.

But talking about Bukowski can really get emotional, which always
reminds me of the factory worker poet in Pittsburgh getting up to
the mic and crying his head out.  And he only had one beer.  I  say
this like I know it because I do.  A woman who seemed  embarrassed
for him near me had said, OH he must be drunk!  And I said No,  No
he's NOT, he just got here from work, and he's not even finished his
first beer.

Makes me want to make postcards that ask, "Do you ever cry when
you read Bukowski?" and stick them deep inside all of his books on
the bookstore and library shelves, with an e-mail they can write to.

Anyway, that's a really great argument you make.  I'm not  agreeing
with all of it, but the argument is fantastic!  Especially when you  get
into the Jim Harrison comparisons.

Lately I've only looked at the last poetry.  None of that goes
on in there.  There are thousands of pages before though, of  course.

His grimace in the mid-work had the quality if I'm remembering, where
no one was of much use.  His meditation on the constant loss of  his
working class friends, the meaninglessness of misjudged steps to and
fro sex and the bar.  It's depressing.

It's funny its freedom, possibly.  The poems themselves became  his
myth work.  And there's also the tie-breaking fantasy of What is  a
freedom, What a cage.  The depth of his poison at some point,  meaning
the idea that strength was in staying the course in the worst  possible
life on earth, gives so many people a sense of pride.  I remember  hearing
that especially from some men I knew in the late 80s.

Which to me makes the argument that there's a kind of coping  mechanism
involved here.  Which I don't believe contradicts much of what you  say.
In fact maybe I'm supporting what you say by saying this.

The BEST thing has always been WHERE Bukowski takes the reader
in the greater family of poets once the reader is exhausted from  being
in the cave (not just FROM exhausting, but IS exhausted).  And  there
have been a few people I've met who claim to only like the Beats, but
they're rare, I bet.

Okay, maybe I need to take a serious look at those mid-life books and
see these women.  Glad you took the time to tell this.  I'm sure  that
the women aren't any less shrill and forgettable as he paints  himself.

Thanks Mark,
CAConrad

              Nobody in the widow's household
            ever celebrated anniversaries.
            In the secrecy of my room
            I would not admit I cared
            that my friends were given parties.
            Before I left town for school
            my birthday went up in smoke=20

            the Department of Vital Statistics.

            Don't take it so to heart.

And so who do we believe in? God? Gov'ts? People?

  I was with a muslim friend of mine in Xingjiang. He calls himself Buick (after the car). He grew up believing in the best of the US, in a dreamy world that has inspired so many, hence the only truly multicultural society in the world, one could argue, constructed of all those delays to freedom and sacrifice. And the US, as you know, has inspired any number of revolutionary movements (including the French, who would later jail Tom Paine)--although, clearly, for many reasons (both favorable and negative). His country is now part of the "reunified Chinese homeland"--as today it's called in the local museum and press. I don't think he knows, because I have seen no need to make his life more complicated, nor our relationship, because I am his friend, on his side, and he is a proud man, that the US began assisting China in its subjugation, reeducation, absorbtion of Buick's people (which was part of deal struck following 9/11). I wonder when Americans will take a good look
 around?

I used to see SK at the supermarket a couple of blocks down Sixth Avenue.  =
I
think I once said, I know who you are and I admire you and if you're lookin=
g
for a pineapple, this one's going to be sweet.  No I didn't but I should
have.  I know I did say something to him once, maybe about pears, but I
don't remember.  I was too surprised about being in the same stupid
supermarket as he, the esteemed Stanley Kunitz. I used to see him with his
wife.  I gather she died before he did.  I wondered when I saw him and said
nothing. I wanted to invite him back to my apartment for a glass of wine bu=
t
I didn't know his poetry.  I only knew he was a poet.  I was badly read.  N=
o
time for poetry for years. I was fighting all the time.

So I say hello goodbye Stanley.  I wish I had made a connection. But then
again, maybe I wouldn't have found a connection.  That happens sometimes.
Sometimes we writers don't make connections with each other.  Like other
people don't.  Nothing surprising about all this.

I've spend the last few weeks on my magazine.  I think it's
wonderful. Raymond Federman is our featured writer.  We are all poets,
artists, prose writers and "non-fiction" commentators.  Of course, there is
no such thing as non-fiction.  I used to write legal briefs and memoranda.
I should know.
So anyway, drop by, please:  http://www.madhattersreview.com.

Pax vobiscum --  to all of you & to Stanley who pushed an enamel wired cart
of groceries all by himself.

Deep South

Deep in the South, something was sleeping.

For three long years it slept, while outside its burrow white winds blew and
snow drifts piled steadily higher.

But then one day (possibly owing to global climate change) the blizzards
ceased and the temperature began slowly to rise.

Deep South is emerging from hibernation.

We are currently inviting submissions of original poetry, short fiction,
critical essays, extracts from work in progress, reviews, and work by
artists and photographers. Submissions can be made by email to
deep.south@stonebow.otago.ac.nz, or by mail to


Deep South

P.O. Box 56

METEORIC FLOWERS
by Elizabeth Willis
http://www.upne.com/0-8195-6813-9.html

With her new book of poetry, celebrated poet Elizabeth Willis achieves
a truly contemporary vision. Like her earlier work, these poems
explore experience and language in ways that render our definitions
fluid, shift our paradigms, and expand the possibilities of thinking
and feeling. Wesleyan is proud to present METEORIC FLOWERS, a
beautifully crafted intersection between emotion and intelligence,
poetry and prose.

METEORIC FLOWERS was inspired by the scientific pastorals of Erasmus
Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin and respected physician, poet,
philosopher, botanist, and naturalist. Darwin's unique language,
exemplified in Loves of the Plants (1789) and Economy of Vegetations
(1791), provided titles for Willis's poems, and the poems themselves
evoke the spirit of Darwin's own investigative poetics as they work
through the personal and sociopolitical turbulence of
twenty-first-century citizenship.

Willis arranges her poems as cantos with lyrical interludes, shifting
effortlessly between lyric verse and prose. The lyric sections,
entitled "Verses Omitted," "Verses Omitted by Mistake," and "Errata,"
provide an intriguing meditation on the generative quality of error.
The lyric poems effectively say what the prose cannot, and the prose
what the poems cannot.

The language of METEORIC FLOWERS turns corners, builds up unexpected
tensions and progressions, and makes startling leaps and cuts
throughout the book. Willis's knowledge of the Pre-Raphaelite movement
and the writings of Erasmus Darwin is evident, and gives her poetry a
unique sense of vision and respect for the past.

Elizabeth Willis is an assistant professor of English at Wesleyan
University. She is the author of Turneresque (2003), The Human
Abstract (1995), and Second Law (1993). Her poems have appeared in
numerous publications, including American Poetry Review, Aufgabe,
Chicago Review, Conjunctions, The Germ, and How2.

SAMPLE POEM:
Fluent in applejack, I'm knocked off my horse but gaining
on liberty. No one spends all his life tanked, what do I
mean "spends"? What do I mean "his"? I'm wiping my
face on your sleeve as if I'm looking through my own sun.
We live in the flower, so I can't taste anything. It's that hot,
Tex, a new kind of glue. O, I think therefore I green the
grass I'm pinned on.
   -"Plundering Honey"

Guys!

I just won the last prize that will ever be awarded.
They awarded it to me secretly in my hut.
It clips onto my thunder belt rather nicely.
This makes me the last person to win a prize,
but I bet now everyone will want a thunder belt.

Ah but prizes, what are they really good for?
I'll probably wear this around for a week or two
the way Amy wore the crown of monkey bones
they gave her last spring during the Ninth Annual
Monkey Bones Festival before she got bored of it.

Well, when I won that award a couple years ago it came with a
certificate to check my car out, and the nice men at the garage said
there was nothing wrong with it, but they changed the air in my tires
from winter air to summer air, and only charged me $10 per tire!

Here is an updated version of Jig-Sound: http://vispo.com/temp/jig

This is a little different from the last version in that when you link two
sounds via a blue line (thus making them play sequentially), a little blue
circle travels along the blue line. I introduced this for three reasons:
it's the first step toward giving a sense of the music moving through the
jig/construction like data through a network or blood through the body; it
will give players a sense of how long a sound plays; and it will give
players a visual/kinetic sense of what sounds are going to play next.

Come and get your heart broken
by

Edmund Berrigan & Joshua Marie Wilkinson

Sunday, May 21st, 4PM
The Cloister Café
238 East 9th Street
Between 2nd & 3rd Avenues
East Village, NYC

Edmund Berrigan lives and works in New York City. He
is the author of Disarming Matter from Owl Press, as
well as several chapbooks including Your Cheatin'
Heart from furniture press and In the Dream Hole, a
collaborative book with Anselm Berrigan from Man
Press.  His poems have appeared fairly recently in
Drill, Lungfull!, Van Gogh's Ear, and Cannibal. He
also performs music under the guise I Feel Tractor, in
and around New York City.  With Alice Notley and
Anslem Berrigan he co-edited The Collected Poems of
Ted Berrigan.

Joshua Marie Wilkinson's most recent book, Lug Your
Careless Body out of the Careful Dusk, is a long poem
in conversation with Lucian, Freud, Fassbinder, and
Bill Morrison, was the winner of the 2005 Iowa Poetry
Prize chosen by Graham Foust. Wilkinson is also the
author of the recent illustrated chapbook, A Ghost as
King of the Rabbits (New Michigan Press), and the
book-length poem Suspension of a Secret in Abandoned
Rooms, based on an imagined correspondence between
Egon Schiele and Ludwig Wittgenstein, which was
released last summer by Pinball Publishing. Born
exactly seventeen years after Harold Pinter's The
Dwarfs first debuted on the BBC, Wilkinson grew up in
North Seattle, and has since lived in Turkey,
Slovakia, Tucson, and Dublin, and has earned an MFA in
poetry (University of Arizona) and an MA in film
studies (University College Dublin). His writing has
appeared or is forthcoming in 14 Hills, Meridian, Eye
Rhyme, Phoebe, CutBank, Barrow Street, Redactions,
Typo, 42 Opus Pontoon, Backwards City Review, Double
Room, Tarpaulin Sky, Burnside Review, and elsewhere.
His first film, a tour documentary about the band
Califone entitled Made a Machine by Describing the
Landscape, is due out from Thrill Jockey Records later
this year. He makes his home in Denver, Colorado,
where he teaches literature and writing, works as an
editor for the Denver Quarterly, is finishing an
anthology with poet Christina Mengert, and is
completing a doctorate in English and creative
writing. He publishes under a pseudonym after his late
paternal grandmother Marie Wilkinson who was a poet
and published her writing in rural Montana in the
1930s. Mr. Wilkinson is presently at work on two new
books and embarked on a little reading tour of the
south in mid March with Eric Baus and the inimitable
Noah Eli Gordon.

As it should be when so many poets show how well written and thought out
poems might be. That is a beautifully written article.

Subject: very important campaign

Dear friends who care about our earth. Judge for yourself if you want to
take action.

In the Valle de San Felix, the purest water in Chile runs from 2
rivers, fed by 2 glaciers. Water is a most precious resource, and wars
will
be fought for it.

Indigenous farmers use the water, there is no unemployment, and they
provide
the second largest source of income for the area.

Under the glaciers has been found a huge deposit of gold, silver and
other
minerals. To get at these, it would be necessary to
break, to destroy the glaciers - something never conceived of in the
history
of the world - and to make 2 huge holes, each as big as a whole
mountain,
one for extraction and one for the mine's rubbish tip.

The project is called PASCUA LAMA. The company is called Barrick Gold.

The operation is planned by a multi-national company, one of whose
members
is George Bush Senior.

The Chilean Government has approved the project to start this year,
2006.

The only reason it hasn't started yet is because the farmers have got a
temporary stay of execution. If they destroy the glaciers, they will not
just destroy the source of specially pure water, but they will
permanently
contaminate the 2  rivers so they will never again be fit for human or
animal consumption because of the use of cyanide and sulphuric acid in
the
extraction process.

Every last gramme of gold will go abroad to the multinational company
and
not one will be left with the people whose land it is.They will only be
left
with the poisoned water and the resulting
illnesses.

The farmers have been fighting a long time for their land, but have
been forbidden to make a TV appeal by a ban from the Ministry of the
Interior.

Their only hope now of putting brakes on this project is to get help
from international justice.

The world must know what is happening in Chile. The only place to start
changing the world is from here.

How about 'smirking cunt'--something tethered while running through alley's of Prague (came byway of Brit).

  I really wonder, however, if a lot of this is really just pose. I mean, people work, and growing up there were lots of times when, well, was no food, single parent family mom working all the time, so proud that she'd tell me to always decline any invitation for food from friend's home--which meant missing out on vanilla ice cream and bologna sandwhiches with yellow mustard. This notion of working class, one wonders, or rather its definition, seems to be generational, racial, regional, not something outside of particular context. How about the ushering in of an era where there need be no underdogs--only THE MAN to claim label of dipossessed.

  It's only a little less than a pence,
  AJ

Subject:      some very sad news to share about Bukowski
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

A good friend of mine (I didn't think to ask permission to use their  name
I was so STUNNED by the information) who is an excellent source, just
told me yesterday afternoon about a documentary (is it new I wonder?)
where Bukowski is physically abusive to a woman ON CAMERA!

And it wasn't acting, it was a day in the life.

And I want to let everyone know I found this out, and am now saying
that I apologize for having defended Bukowski here and many other
places over the years.  And I'm not the only one, meaning I've  had
arguments with groups in the past, especially the late 80s and early
90s where several of us would be saying, "NO WAY, Bukowski was
never advocating misogyny!"

This documentary is something I NEED to see.  Not to prove my
good friend right, but meaning it's something I NEED to see so that
the world gets its true focus on.

It's terrible news.  It's been years where I've wanted this poet to  be
able to stand up for so much and not be the one to stoop to that.

Men who beat women need their teeth knocked in.

Late last night I was hanging out with another friend.  He was
as shocked as I was by the news of this film showing Bukowski
in the worst possible light.  After we shared our  disappointment,
he told me that the only poem to ever make him cry was a
Bukowski poem.  And it WAS BECAUSE the poem shone a
light on a bleak working class world we understood as our own.
So, we can still have that.  But it's a little harder.

Yes, I've had my share of relationships.  Lovers, friends, like  everyone

I don't think anyone needs their teeth knocked in. On the other hand, I =
like your use of "stoops": bullies always stoop, i.e., they like prey =
smaller than they are.  Women are good, children are excellent.  Anyway, I =
am sorry about your disappointment.  I know far less about Bukowski than =
you do, but would not be amazed to hear that he was abusive to women.

So, we can still have that.  But it's a little harder.

Hey Dodie---

Is that email forwarded from the poet who used to go by the name
"Michael Palmer"? If so, is this a new development? Him now going back to
his given name?
Wow...Or, if it's someone else, sorry for bugging you.

Well, and maybe I've missed lots in this conversational which might've made me feel otherwise, but this all your saying seems, well, very colloquial.

Provflux is an upcoming psychogeopraphy festival in Providence, happening
all over the city from June 1-4. It actually happens to be going on at the
same time and in the same city as this year's Congress for New Urbanism. If
you're in the area you might think about following it around.

More info:
http://pipsworks.com/provflux2006/provflux2006.html

* * *

Blurb from the website:

PIPS [People Interested in Participatory Societies] is pleased to announce
the 3rd annual Provflux, a weekend-long event dedicated to artistic and
social investigations into urban reality and imagination.

Provflux is created to be an interdisciplinary gathering for all people
interested in urban interventions, networking technology, on the ground
issues and solutions, game play, and planning. This year's Provflux will be
a small glimpse into the creative and social potential of new ideas and
technologies that are becoming part of our urban reality.

Within this context, Provflux hopes to create a space for imaginative and
innovative solutions to a sometimes homogenous and uninspiring urban
landscape.

This third year of Provflux is proud to host a broad range of artists,
mappers, thinkers, architects, and visionaries, all who will be presenting
their visions of the city. The public is invited to participate in these
artistic and social investigations into urban reality and imagination.

The Los Angeles Press club invites you to:
News Junkie and Prisoner of X grilled by Generation Kill.

WHAT: A reception sponsored by Vampire for two now-sober journalistic
troublemakers:=20

=80Allan MacDonell , whose incendiary memoir, Prisoner of X: 20 Years in the
Hole at Hustler Magazine (Feral House), has been featured in the NY Times,
NY Post, Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair and NPR; and

=80Jason Leopold , the obsessive-compulsive investigative journalist very muc=
h
in the news lately=20
<http://news.google.com/news?hl=3Den&amp;ned=3Dus&amp;q=3DJason+Leopold> . His
News Junkie (Process) details the felonious conduct prior to his rise and
fall at the Los Angeles Times, Salon and Dow Jones Newswires, and later his
rise once again in the independent media.


FOLLOWED BY: A discussion with the two writers moderated by

=80Evan Wright, whose bestselling Generation Kill, about American grunts in
Iraq, won the 2005 PEN award for the best work of researched nonfiction.

WHEN: Thursday, May 18. Reception with Vampire wines, vodka and energy
drinks begins at 6:30 p.m., with presentation and Q & A starting at 7:30
p.m.

WHERE: The Steve Allen Theater located in Los Feliz/East Hollywood, 4773
Hollywood Blvd., one block west of Vermont. Plenty of free parking. Check
out www.steveallentheater.com <http://www.steveallentheater.com/>  for
details.=20

WHY: Because Chuck (Fight Club) Palahniuk sez, "Prisoner of X is hours of
guilty pleasure that pass like seconds. Here's the unsafe, hook-up sex of
memoir. You'll need to indulge before the restraining orders pull this grea=
t
book off of store shelves." Because Greg Palast ( The Best Democracy Money
Can Buy) sez, "Every author in America should read News Junkie, then quit o=
r
riot." And Jason Leopold's TruthOut.org stories have been subpoenaed by
Scooter Libby's attorney in Plamegate, and Jason's Halliburton in Iran stor=
y
was selected for inclusion in this year's Project Censored collection.

YOU MIGHT BE LUCKY: And win free signed copies of Prisoner of X and News
Junkie.=20

COST: free for members, $5 for non-members, so why don't you join!

I've seen Bukowski: Born Into This and Bukowski really makes himself look
foolish because he throws a temper tantrum and starts kicking Linda
Bukowkski. It is pretty awful and I certainly wouldn't have ever gone out
with him!

You honestly thought a guy that treated poetry and language so badly
would treat women better?

Misogynist?  Misanthrope?=20

Labels; I dislike labels.=20

I've read a great deal of labeling here on the list.  Fact is, I've been =
labeled. =20

I started reading Bukowski about 4 years ago.  I'm a fan of his writing. =
=20

And I'm confused. =20

How does the fact that some footage exists in which it is alleged he =
"abused" a woman (and I'm not really certain what exactly "abused" =
means) diminish any artistic accomplishments?=20

Does not the work stand for and by itself?  Is it not possible to have =
good poetry from a sociopath? =20

That the man was (allegedly) an abusive, macho-moron speaks of the man, =
not of his works.  But that is a minor point logically. =20

Does it not strike any of the rest of you that labeling a man based on =
documented behavior in one instance may well be a case of leaping to =
conclusions...one swallow still does not a summer make, in my mind. =20

Too, there may be another side to the discussion of the man...he was a =
hard drinker, No, that's inaccurate.  He was a drunkard; he drank =
regularly to excess.  Was it Rodney Dangerfield who said: I never knew =
he drank until I saw him sober one night. =20

The point is some people become different people under the =
influence...perhaps that should read, all people are different people =
when intoxicated. =20

Is there any dispute to the allegation here that alcohol is a mind and =
behavior altering drug?

Do we see, in a taped episode of an abusive man, a drunk misbehaving? =20

My father was a mean drunk.  He drank ,and he beat up folks, his =
children, his friends, his wife, strangers in the bar...didn't matter =
the sex or the relationship...dad just beat up folks when he was drunk.=20

Once, my mother sent me out to the bar to bring him home to dinner; I =
got to the front of the bar (Andy's Bar and Grill on Clinton St. in =
Binghamton) just in time to see a man come crashing through the front =
window of the bar to land on the sidewalk.  Dad had, for no apparent =
reason, just punched the guy, and the poor guy crashed into the window.  =
Of course, repayment followed, and of course, there were consequences!  =
The point is, dad was a mean drunk.  =20

Fortunately, dad quit drinking at 36, and spent the remaining 50 years =
of his life totally on the wagon.  He gave up baseball, booze, and =
beating up folks.  Some of you might blame baseball for his behavior.  =
Me, I think the culprit was the Jack Daniels chasers to the beers =
(boilermakers too didn't help); although I do acknowledge that boring =
baseball games may be strong motivators for violence.=20

Was dad a misogynist because he beat mom?  Hmmmmm....I don't think so.  =
I think dad was out of control because of the alcohol; he beat up dogs, =
other drunkards, friends, enemies, relatives, strangers of both sexes. =20

Was Bukowski a misogynist because he "abused (what ever that word means =
here) a woman in a taped/video recording?  Hmmmmmmmm....I don't think =
so.  I think Bukowski was a poet, who, under the influence of excessive =
alcohol became a mean drunk.  That he may have found it easier to be =
mean to women may indicate he was more a coward than a misogynist.  =
However, both coward and misogynist are labels.  I'd rather not use =
labels.=20

But, hey, what does any of that have to do with Bukowski's works?=20

 Not a damn thing. =20

And, are there 'great' works present within the body of the man's =
efforts?  Who cares!  I've no idea how to quantify 'great' as it relates =
to modern poetry.  And I discount totally that horse shit from the grad =
school profs who proclaimed that the measure of a poet was her/his =
influence on others.  We can't know influence for perhaps centuries.  =
What will the students of 2205 think of Bukowski?   "Damn," they may =
utter, "the man was kind to women." =20

                  By Leo Lewis
  Businessmen shed light on the real pains of office life as they pour out their hearts in a poetry contest                                          JAPAN is back and good times are rolling again for its overworked white-collar masses.

  It should be the best of times but the bittersweet wit of the salaryman’s haiku tells a rather different story. In stolen minutes during meetings, on hurried lunch breaks and on their long commutes home, workers have spent the past month squeezing their innermost thoughts on daily working life into 17 pithy syllables.      “Do it! Just do it! That was what my boss always shouted, but he was the one that was ‘done’,” runs a hot contender for the coveted Senryu Trophy. “I spend more on daily diet products than I do on daily meals,” moans another.                    NI_MPU('middle');  Every year since the heady 1980s Dai-Ichi Seimei, the largest life insurance company in Japan, has run a national competition to find the best workers’ senryu, a loose variation on the haiku, with fewer rules and more scope for puns and slang. Because the 750,000 entrants are encouraged to concentrate on the experiences of their daily lives, the competition entries have become one of the most
 accurate gauges of the salaryman ’s state of mind and, by extension, the national Zeitgeist. A competition organiser said: “Every year it is a reflection of life in modern society because it lets people express their feelings and complaints freely.” The best entries this year draw out the contradictions of renewed economic growth. Salarymen have been repeatedly told that business is booming and that Japan is out of its long rut. M any, however, remain unhappy.      “Ten thousand yen to have the dog coiffed, but I can only spend a thousand yen on my haircut,” one poem reads. “It’s always the people who don’t actually need a pension that make decisions about the pension system,” reads another.      Some gain particular praise because they exploit a buzz-phrase and play on double meanings, such as: “I wish my wife had a manner [silent] mode like my mobile phone.”   The government drive to make salarymen wear jumpers in winter to save on heating and go without ties in summer
 to save on air-conditioning is regarded by many as being pointless. Hence, a high-ranking entry this year reads: “I have to wear warm biz, but my wallet is always cool biz.”      Something that has crept into selection is an increasing bitterness among salarymen about the relatively easy lifestyle of their non-working wives. Salarymen had previously believed that it was their job to provide; now they seem to resent the role.      “My wife always eats posh; I just eat cheap nosh,” writes one, and another notes: “The missus always asks, ‘Can I buy this, can I buy that?’ When I know she’s already bought it.”      This year the first baby-boomers — Japan’s biggest generation — will retire en masse, and many of their poems reflect the fears of an ageing population. A poem such as “I used to bar-crawl; now I will hospital-crawl”, is a representative example.

You may or may not know that next Tuesday is Marvelous Marvin Hagler's
52 birthday.
You may or may not know he's from Brockton, Mass.
You may or may not know that he is and was awesome.

So this week Rock Heals celebrates his birth/pays tribute with some fine
fine (somwhat) boxing-related writing from Ric Royer and Kevin Thurston.

And moreso, recent RH weeks have been pretty boss with work from Don
Illich, Bob Massey, Mike Grau, and John Shanchuk-Corrin See-and-me. Some
poetry, illustrated poetry, a letter from LA, and a good old Hot House 5

Not defending his actions -- but is one man kicking one woman misogyny?
Probably all in the context, which I haven't seen.
And is being more angry about a man hitting a woman because of her
womanhood not some other kind of relegation of women to an other/lesser
class?
Bullying a different matter; I'll be teaching my daughter to punch
bullies in the mouth.

RE Bukowski, obviously I haven't read enough of his work if my fave
thing about him is the Modest Mouse song. It is a really good song though.

Frankly if we have to disqualify an artist because of personal behaviour or
ideology we are going to be excluding allot of people. The reality is that
we are a society that is moralistic and hypocritical. People can be two
things at once and that does not remove their importance.

I have heard poets as varied as Creeley, Ashbery, Frost and Stevens
dismissed because they were woman haters or anti semites or some other vice
--supposedly- later after time is turns out not to be true

I think this is the worst form of Mc Carthyism.

     When I was 13 by chance I discovered Rimbaud and it changed my life.
I'd never been gaga abt a poet or poetry before but within a year was
devouring Baudelaire, Gerard de Nerval and Villon along with Rimbaud.  I
have read and reread them continuously ever since.  I am glad I began with
them as they gave me the vivid presentations that a poet's life is never
easy.  Excepting Nerval, they defied the State, were in trouble with the law
and morally suspect shall we say.  And on a grand scale! They are also great
great writers whose influence is huge.  When I read the bios of other poets
later on often of course they were milder in adventure and outrage--and
often the misdeeds were perhaps of a pettier nature. (Downright
disappointing, often enough! ho ho ho!) Yet everyone has their own
pettinesses in them--it's just that often people build up poets into heros
and heroines, Saints and etc--only to find the cracks and flaws in the
statues and then react with horror and revulsion as though monsters have
emerged from among the flower pots.  I was thinking if i went  by some of
the criteria that seem to govern this list at times, one wd probably not be
allowed to read Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Villon, maybe not even the gentle
Gerard.  (He would be damned for "orientalism" in his books on his travels
in the orient/middle east, egypt--.)
      I started to wonder if one could compile a list of the approved
poets--i.e. those who are safely free of any tainted form of thought or
action, word or deed?  Would it be a bit like those investigations in to the
lives of people proposed for Sainthood?  Obviously on a case by case
basis--the same factors can be given different weights according to
different rules as found laid out at times here.  It might be a lot of
fun!--Who would emerge from all this?--"Inquiring minds want to know"--
       My grandfather, a Quebecois-Ojibway steamfitter, told me one time,
"you better watch out, Americans think all French writesr are hoodlums."
Right there is part of the attraction of course esp to young people--and of
course a good reason to banish them for all their rotten thoughts words and
deeds.  Talk about bad influences!
     "Honi soit qui mal y pense"!!!

Hey all,

I'm a digest subscriber so I'm lumping these responses
together.

Here's a Bukowski poem that I used to see all the time
when riding on the bus.  Maybe it'll help:

*******************

It's been ages since I've read Bukowski, and then it
was just "Ham on Rye" and "Women."  I've heard high
praise for "Post Office", but never got around to
reading it.  The movie "Barfly" was a phony fantasy,
whereas his voice over for "The Best Hotel on Skid
Row" seemed to capture his reality, though it wasn't
about him.  I haven't read hardly any of his poetry,
but I've enjoyed this discussion.  It makes me want to
pull out my vinyl copy of "Charles Bukowski Reads His
Poetry" and give it another listen.

The man obviously had some problems.  But, like Henry
Rollins, Bukowski got lots of people, who might not
otherwise have bothered, to read poetry.  Too many
people are turned off poetry by the narrow academic
spiel and snob attitude they get through schooling.
That said there are no heroes, just flawed human
beings trying to do the best they can, and, like even
the best baseball players, mostly failing.  But,
whattayagonnado?

I have heard some Canadian friends compare Al Purdy to
Charles Bukowski as a form of introduction for
ignorant Americans like myself.  Having recently read
your book "Al Purdy", I'm sure you don't agree with
the comparison.  I haven't read much of Al Purdy's
poetry yet.  Perhaps you could offer a better
introduction with a short explanation of how Al Purdy
better represents a working class, beer drinking poet,
and why perhaps everyone should try reading Purdy
instead of Bukowski.

Thanks for posting this.  I've checked out Paul
Dutton, bpNichol and Tracie Morris so far, and plan on
listening to the rest.  I've got a sound poem of my
own that might fit in, but I haven't recorded it yet.

Implicit/Complicit: Performance By My Invisible

Within the past year, Providence-based writers Popahna Brandes, Carolina
Maugeri, and Miranda F. Mellis  formed the string collaborative, My
Invisible.  Their recombinant sound ranges from pop, art rock, to ethereal

cycle-in-progress, and followed by a discussion of the band's collaborative
process. My Invisible debuted in January as  the opening act for Rebecca
Gates at The Knitting  Factory and has recently accompanied Anne Waldman at
Providence's Downcity Poetry Series. "Implicit/Complicit" is a song on the
band's  eponymous first album (available at www.myinvisible.com). Popahna
Brandes is the director of International Inkwell, a yearly writing workshop
program in Montelieu, France.=A0Carolina Maugeri is currently writing a lyric
sequence exploring images of children's street art in her hometown of
Tokuyama, now Shunan-shi, Japan. Miranda F. Mellis is an editor at

appeared in Denver Quarterly and Fence.

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the list has
about 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial number of
nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web site (see
archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep in mind
the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support
and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one: in
most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the list,
and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv editorial
board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which calls for all
messages to be read and approved before being forwarded to the list. We
prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the spontaneity of discussion
that we hope to promote. In addition to these options, the editorial
board will unsubscribe individuals if they are not, in our opinion,
productively contributing to the list or following our guidelines. We
remain committed to this editorial function as a defining element of the
Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about this
list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The
idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather than
general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list relatively
small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the list are
generally 50 messages per day, and one or two messages per subscriber
per day; but these limits are subject to change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the EPC.

2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions
of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. We strongly
encourage subscribers to post information, including web links, relating
to publications (print and internet), reading series, and blogs that
they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear. Such
announcements constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly to
the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in automatic
deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy, should
be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the
"from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.
Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post will be
unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu
this one-line message with no "subject": sub poetics [your Firstname and
Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and not
receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to the
list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics nomail.
Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with the
author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you can
also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or in
HTML format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set
poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or digest
mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of time. Your
account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics messages as well as
other important mail. In such cases, switch your subscription to
"nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then
resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while critique
of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main
functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique or
criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes competing
interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with our
collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent
in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for
all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from
this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's
permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of
published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that you
get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see
if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not
posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to
contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

Am I right in assuming (I haven't been following this discussion very
closely) that this is related to the Poetics policy saying that sexist abuse
is as unwelcome as racist abuse? If so, let me clarify.

Nobody has, to my knowledge, been talking about "banning" poets for sexist
or misogynist writing or behaviour. This dictum relates only to the
discourse on the list and seems to me fair enough (it is clearly about
abuse). My personal feeling is that if there is a list policy on racist
slurs, it is a considerable oversight not to have one on sexism, and
personally I've been somewhat puzzled by a number of a postings in which it
has been strongly suggested that objections to sexism in writing of any kind
are not legitimate criticisms.

I do not believe in judging writing from the alleged moral qualities of its
writer or from its alleged ideology. I admire Ezra Pound, David Jones,
Celine and other writers of dubious political affiliations. I adore
Baudelaire despite his explicit disavowal that women are capable of reading
poetry. To say that Baudelaire's writing raises questions about gender is
NOT the same as saying one should not read him. It might be an invitation,
in fact, to read him with closer attention. I assume that we are all adults
here.

Thank you

Alison

Hi, Jennifer.
I'm writing to find out if it wd be possible to stay at the apt for a week
or so--guess it depends on other stay-ers. I'm a Boston-area poet, 57,
missing NY, & know poets & musicians in Brooklyn, so it sounds like fun.
Best,
Ruth Lepson

Being more angry about a man hitting a woman because of her womanhood I
wouldn't say necessarily relegates woman to Other, but reifies the fact that
we're viewed as Other and treated as such by institutionalized, power
wielding hierarchies. There is nothing in this culture that suggests women
are anything other than Other. The Equal Rights Amendment wasn't passed,
women still make .84 cents on the dollar of every man, female poets are only
achieving their visibility in numbers as of the last fifty years (as opposed
to the entire history of Western Art, devoting its many glossy pages in
anthologies to a 'human' experience that is predominantly male owned and
operated) and female poetics must combatting the patriarchal power dynamics
embedded into the language itself.

Was Bukowski a misogynist? I don't know. If he was, he surely isn't alone.
This seems to be the broader question: can we avoid falling into tropes,
where the male speaker articulates 'the human experience' and the female
subject is the space upon which his desire is enacted or projected?

"A poet looks at the world / as a man looks at a woman." -Wallace Stevens.
Ruth Stone says in response, "I can never know what a man sees / when he
looks at a woman. / This is a sealed universe. / On the outside of the
bubble / everything is stretched to infinity”


We need to seek infinity.

Myth, by Muriel Rukeyser
Long afterward, Oedipus, old and blinded, walked the roads. He smelled a
familiar smell. It was the Sphinx. Oedipus said, “I want to ask one
question. Why didn’t I recognize my mother?”
“You gave the wrong answer, said the Sphinx.
“But that was what made everything possible,” said Oedipus.
“No,” she said. “When I asked, what walks on four legs in the morning, two
at noon, and three in the evening, you answered man. You didn’t say anything
about woman.”
“When you say Man,” said Oedipus, “you include women too. Everyone knows
that.”
She said, “That’s what you think.”

Not defending his actions -- but is one man kicking one woman misogyny?
Probably all in the context, which I haven't seen.
And is being more angry about a man hitting a woman because of her womanhood
not some other kind of relegation of women to an other/lesser class?
Bullying a different matter; I'll be teaching my daughter to punch bullies
in the mouth.

RE Bukowski, obviously I haven't read enough of his work if my fave thing
about him is the Modest Mouse song. It is a really good song though.

Subject: some very sad news to share about Bukowski


	 	A good friend of mine (I didn't think to ask permission to use their name
I was so STUNNED by the information) who is an excellent source, just
told me yesterday afternoon about a documentary (is it new I wonder?)
where Bukowski is physically abusive to a woman ON CAMERA!
And it wasn't acting, it was a day in the life.
And I want to let everyone know I found this out, and am now saying
that I apologize for having defended Bukowski here and many other
places over the years. And I'm not the only one, meaning I've had
arguments with groups in the past, especially the late 80s and early
90s where several of us would be saying, "NO WAY, Bukowski was
never advocating misogyny!"
This documentary is something I NEED to see. Not to prove my
good friend right, but meaning it's something I NEED to see so that
the world gets its true focus on.
It's terrible news. It's been years where I've wanted this poet to be
able to stand up for so much and not be the one to stoop to that.
Men who beat women need their teeth knocked in.
Late last night I was hanging out with another friend. He was
as shocked as I was by the news of this film showing Bukowski
in the worst possible light. After we shared our disappointment,
he told me that the only poem to ever make him cry was a
Bukowski poem. And it WAS BECAUSE the poem shone a
light on a bleak working class world we understood as our own.
So, we can still have that. But it's a little harder.

Wow, Leigh. That thesaurus thing took me aback rather... And yes, quite, on
your other points.

Btw, Some people have kindly written to tell me that the McCarthyism tag is
to do with the discussion of Bukowski's personal behaviour. Of course I am
aware of this. All the same, the subtext is that discussing gender issues i=
n
work is the same as calling for blackbans on authors. My point holds: it
isn't.=20

I did, Mark. The descriptions  are somewhat more - uh - I don't know -
"masterful", doncha think? They don't have anything to do with "weak" until
you click on "boy" and find "mama's boy", aka the feminised man...

Exactly! Mr. Perez! When I said colloquial, I think many of these ideas shared are bordering on archaic, and often racially based.

  And when I say that poets should be denuded, because at best we can gleen something (at worst, removed them from our way).

Actually responding to the intervening replies, not just the one
below... I think I raised "don't hit girls" in the context of the folks
on this list (cuz let's realize the consciously-misogynist to not ratio
here is most likely better off than the global ratio, and that I would
say most of us are "on the same" team vis-a-vis the broader objectives
of the fight for equality) + in the context of being someone that is
raising a child and dealing with that as a lens on the larger issue --
make sense? I know this isn't a parenting list, but hey, just speaking
from where I am.

Many would say my daughter is often "dressed like a boy," and I've
always thought tomboys are coolest (she's young enough to still be a bit
of a molding of "what we want for her"), and yet I still find myself
drawn to occassionally dressing her in pink every now and again and
being enamored with her looking like a "sweet little girl." I think in
the context of this list I don't really need to unpack the massive
amount of conflict going on here re how I raise her (in reality) v. my
own theoretical/political views on "gender and all that shit."

Weren't many of us (of the male persuasion) raised with "don't hit
girls" before we were given the "don't pick on people smaller/weaker"
than you message? Is that a shorthand your folks used at a time that you
weren't able to really break down the complexity of "weaker" and act
upon it appropriately? Much like the "hold my hand when you cross the
street" rule that's in place until they have the faculties to break the
situation down and act accordingly. And yet what mark are these
(necessarily?) simplified messages leaving contrary to our goals re
gender equalities? How many of these other simplified messages end up
nearly-hardwired into our systems to color our reality for(nearly)ever?
There's nothing implicitly wrong with going through life with an onboard
"don't hit girls" message, but is that an early assault of the "the
female of the species as lesser" outlook?

Yeah, this is probably 95% unrelated to poetics... except perhaps in a
discussion of how one deals with message/intent v. audience reception.
Which is a wicked interesting conversation on its own.

I promise, I'll go back to lurking soon ;)

After a week of this, maybe it is time at last to call it a night, roll
in the political sidewalk, the agendas, excuse-making, and the
whatever-the-word-is for man-hating.  It's all been here, all week, all
the time.

Bukowski was a 3rd rate poet and a violent first-rate drunk, a
self-promoter who encircled himself with acolytes by dint of what I
assume was a magnetic personality.  Mike Hammer with a typewriter.
Hitler was a charm-boy too.  So the myth lives on that this guy could
write.  Violence against women?  What do you expect from a man like
this?  He was an alcoholic.  How come we've missed the dreaded A-word in
here?  Drunks hurt people physically or emotionally: it's part of the
job description.  Some alkies do stuff like that; it's not male culture,
it's bottle culture.  They don't have any self-control so the
violence-prone among them kick the crap out of anyone in their way.  If
two guys get into it in a saloon, it's known as a barroom fight.  If
it's a guy beating up a woman, it's assault and treating the woman as
The Other.  Sorry to distress your theory, but in my travels I've met at
least one woman who'd been a biker drunk and told me "If you crossed me
I was going to kill you."  Did that make her Xena Warrior Princess or
Xena Woman Wino?  When she whupped up on some guy in a bar with a
motorcycle chain, was it revenge for the dishonored female sex or
indictable assault?

I know...I'm missing the point...big news...it's all about oppression by
a male power base.  Where did I leave my viola?  We've gone from the
"Buk was a sexist pig" thread to one I heard in my faculty preceptor's
apartment in Johnson City, NY in May 1970, from a woman named Rachel
Blegen: "All men should be castrated from collective guilt."  So this
current argument is not quite original.

Some questions:

1. I was just removed from a job with a documented (intercepted) age
discrimination memo to prove it.  The company was Citigroup.  I got a
lawyer.  Nobody did a goddamn thing, except Citi, which offered me a job
it then withdrew from the table when I said Yes.  Like racist?  Try
Indian-Giver.  So do you think I care about yet another toothless
amendment?  What would the ERA have proved?

2. Eighty-four cents on the dollar beats not working.  Next.

3. Tell me the experience I own because I have outdoor plumbing.
Unemployment, age discrimination, lifetime alimony?  Right, nobody ever
asked me "Honey, make the coffee."  If that meant I'd get paid, I'd be
there.  Hey, you mean Freud MIGHT have been onto something?

5. Put down your crying towel masquerading as political outrage or
theory.  Do something.  Vengeance isn't the Lord's, it's yours.

A drunk is a drunk is a drunk is a drunk. I agree wholeheartedly. I was also
responding not to specifically Bukowski, but a sentiment that critiquing a
male for beating a woman relegates woman to Other. I'm saying, woman is
Other. Like it or not.

In regards to your response:

Wow. That was a little more backlash than was called for. Towards the end of
my discussion, I was asking for unity: not division and conquer. Clearly, I
was misread and there are better places for my contributions to any dialogue
that I might have envisioned here.

I am especially appreciative of the personal attack towards the ends, the
one that assumes I do nothing of political or social consequence. I am an
inbox full of words, and you are entirely estranged from the being on the
other end of these words. How dismissive could you possibly be? Forgive me
for saying so, but I think your demeanor is damaging to your credibility,
not mine. Whatever I said clearly triggered some kind of persecution complex
that dominantly expresses itself in the anecdotal and the form of pathos,
entirely outside of logical, progressive philosophies of gender inequality.

Backlash?  In the end I was really agreeing with you, just summoning
people to take responsibility.  You remember the battle over the ERA, so
do I.  It became difficult to sustain after awhile because I, at least,
started to see an expectation that any law could change something.

I'm glad you appreciated it, but that wasn't my intention.  Oh, the
crying towel comment?  The Freud comment.  Okay, yes, those were over
the top.  I can't make it up to you so all I can say is I regret having
said it.

I am not trying to be unkind but I could care less about the being

Right, the pathetic phallusy.  Like I sad, I'm having 1970 flashbacks
here.  You were and are substituting political rhetoric for experience,
however you define that somewhat elusive term.  If you wish to read what
I said as dismissive, oh well.  I don't care much about credibility.
Credibility with whom?  Were you about to offer me a reading series of
chapbook before I said what I did?  Unless you are of direct use to me,
I'm not interested.

But you did.  That is enough.  Now you will sling some more shit at me
in the dialectic of the Frankfurt School, I will delete it unread, and
you will have had the famous Last Word.

Dona nobis pacem,

Subject:      Re: some very sad news to share about Bukowski
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Some people have written to me directly about this.  And a few  say
that they can't believe that I didn't know about this.  Well, I  didn't.
Bukowski reminded me of some uncles of mine, okay?  Dirty old
men who liked drinking, talking dirty, but my uncles were actually
kind men, very kind men.  From what I am now hearing Bukowski
was a brute.  Beating and kicking one woman on film, and no, it
was not acting.

Then there were some surprising e-mails to me that asked WHY
I was having such a hard time with this, in fact one saying, Well,
c'mon now, how do you feel about Clinton, etc.  Well, Clinton?
Bill Clinton did not beat on anyone, far as I know.  And frankly I  do
not like Bill Clinton anyway.  He's scum, with or without such  things
in his past.

When I wrote the subject line, "some very sad news" I was not
being dramatic.  It made me sad.

And to those who wrote me calling me a YoYo on the issue, I say,
HEY, what kind of a person would you prefer I be?  One who found
out such information and decided to hide it?  First of all, why  would
you want me to do that?  Second, why would you think I'm the  type
of person to do that?

I mean, WHERE WERE YOU when you first found out that Pound
was an anti-Semite?  Because I REMEMBER!  I was a kid, and  this
poet in Philadelphia a good fifteen years older than me had turned
me onto some of the cantos, which were blowing my MIND!  Then
a few months after, he drops that bomb.  And I have to say that  I'm
grateful to have been given the gift of reading the work without all
the filtering that certainly would have taken place.  That was  nice.
And fortunate.  Fortunate for the sake of the poems.  Wish  everyone
could have that to be honest.

It's like a friend of mine years ago, she LOVED Richard Brautigan,
LOVED him, practically memorized TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA.
Then one day we were at the Dairy Queen where she worked at the
time, and she said, "Is he still alive?"  And I said NO, he killed  himself.
For some reason I had just assumed she knew.  But she hated him
after finding that out, which always seemed stupid to me, but it's
not my decision to make.  She threw his books out, including the
hardcover edition of the now out of print and hard to find TOKYO
MONTANA EXPRESS.  Anyway, we all have to have our room with
such information.

It's an ugly thing, men beating women.  Have you encountered  this?
I'm not interested in getting into the details in public, but I have,  and
I was very young.  And there's something about men who do that,
who will do that, they're different, this kind of bully.  They're  pathetic,
but their RAGE at being pathetic seems to drive that need to bully
and make others suffer.  And sometimes it's things like losing a  job
that kick-starts it.  Sometimes it's just who they are, this big,  stupid,
pathetic man.

And a couple people wrote saying that they don't think these men
need their teeth kicked in, as I said they did.

I'm afraid the answer is that YES they do.  And it's NOT just  because
they deserve it, it's also because some of the men I've encountered
who DO these things respond to nothing but brute force.  It's the  one
thing that makes itself around their shielding.  And as far as  I'm
concerned if punching a man in the teeth is going to relieve the  suffering
of a woman and the children she may have who are also suffering in
all this, then so be it.

And of course it's not just men who do this.  I've known lesbian  couples
and gay guy couples where this goes on.  Few things on Earth are  worse.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A question for those of you who teach creative
writing.

Here's the set up, which I'm sure many of you are
familiar with: I teach a college level introduction to
creative writing to students who don't read poetry,
can't in general write or even read well, have the
predictable and forgiveable ideas about what it means
to write poetry and to be an author at all. Some of
them want to be writers; most are hostile about the
actual literature they are required to read. They
don't have much money, so I can't ask them to buy lots
of books, and their cultural and racial backgrounds
are diverse. Some of them are 19, some 25, a few in
their thirties, forties, and fifties. Please
understand that I'm not trying to be condescending in
this broad description, just as accurate as I can be
on the level of the demographic. I recognize that
people are all unique individuals.

Have you used any anthologies of poetry that have
worked well in such classes? Add this particular
twist: I don't want to expose them only to post-Robert
Frost American American lyric narratives a la Billy
Collins.

By the way, I'm hardly asking this question as someone
who is new to teaching this kind of audience: I've
done it for years.

And I've still never found an anthology that I'm more
than marginally able to use.

Thanks for your insights!

Mark

And another thing.

This is NOT SAYING THAT I'M JOINING the bandwagon with the
notion that Creeley, Ginsberg, etc., etc., etc., are woman haters.

It makes ME CRAZY when people say such things with no proof,
with little more than "a feeling" or some such shit!

THIS IS EXACTLY like some queer writers I've met who will USE
homophobia to their advantage.  It's true, trust me, I've seen  it.
It pisses me off.  There's plenty of misogyny and homophobia on
this planet, we certainly don't need to be inventing any.

I'd use the Hoover anthology: _Postmodern American Poetry_. Something for

Hi Mark

Poems for the Millenium, Vol II is the best I've come up with, tho it has
only a sprinkling of each poet. But for innovative poetry, it's terrific,
and something they can dip into long after the course.
Eliot Weinberger's American Poetry Since 1950 is excellent but I believe out
of print.

Best,
Ruth L.

Mark,

I, too, use Hoover's anthololgy. I also use Mary Oliver's A Poetry =
Handbook. Inevitably, some complain that there's not enough 19th century =
and earlier work; others glad for Hoover, their minds pried open. I also =
supplement these texts with handouts, websites, and required attendance =
at readings.

Regular college class, meets for something like 15 weeks. This is not an
easy thing, and I've tried various ways, none of which work perfectly. At
this point in time I think you're better off making your own anthology, and
it doesn't have to be a lot. Even just one poem a week, emphasizing
something different either in approach to the making, or something quite
technical, or something else. So, 15 poems, that's all, and, I think,
enough. Now the question is, when you make your own and photocopy, what to
do about permissions? You may be able to get them from publishers; if
you're working with living authors, even your peers, you may be able to get
them directly from the poets.

On the other hand, lately, I've had to teach a more general intro to
lit/writing class, and I've had good success with

         Gardner, Janet E., et al, eds., Literature: A Portable Anthology
(Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2004)

It has a lot I'd never use (and it also has many short stories and a few
plays), but it also has just a little, and enough poetry, that I can use,
from Wyatt to Donne and including a bit of Pound, Williams, Stein,
Zukofsky, Howe (Susan), Hejinian, O'Hara, Duncan, Creeley, Ginsberg, etc.
I've been glad to have it, and sorry that the college where I teach
part-time is probably deciding to change to something else, which probably
won't have any of the above authors except possibly Wyatt, Donne, Pound &
Williams.

good luck!

Hi -- I teach a population much like yours and what I have done in
introductory courses is create my own anthology. I created spurious
categories like "vegetables" or "weather" and asked the students to read one
or two of these spurious categories (filled with a variety of very good and
diverse poems) each week and to perform various kinds of analyses on them.
In about week eight I told the students to pull out all the category titles
and to redo the anthology in terms of real categories that grew out our
discussions of poems in the first eight weeks -- by which point they knew
something about poetry and poetics. In class I had them doing constraint
based writing and out of class as well. It worked fine. I've never ordered
anthologies for my classes. I do order real books.

Hope this is useful.

Prior to and even with the advent of the Printing Press, my impression is
that one could go to a particular site in Paris - next to Notre Dame(?) -
and there find manuscript or printed pages for different texts there were
hanging from from lines, almost like laundry. A consumer would go around and
select the pages that he wanted to anthologize and make his order. Then he
was told when to come back and pick up his bound copy. I suspect a fresh
velum illuminated manuscript probably took a few months!

Is that what happens now at Kinkos with student editions - instructors
compose an anthology of x,y and z texts, be it poetry or otherwise? This
precedes my student time by a few generations, and these editions - unlike
those in Medieval Paris - look like merde.

But, anyway, Mark, isn't it possible to put together an anthology of diverse
poems into such a gathering and march students off to Kinkos (which is
required to pay royalties to the source)?

I have not checked out my old company, ebrary (www.ebrary.com). I am not
sure how expansive their poetry collection are these days - though they have
about 80,000 books and docs in their collectio. But I think a teacher can
guid a student to build an anthologies off diverse sources from their
publisher collections - and the publishers will be compensated for such use.

Has anybody tried this?

Kinkos can be hard to deal with on these matters - After an earlier supreme
court decision, they started refusing to copy ANYTHING that appeared to have
been in print -- including, in 1997, my own copy of my own proof pages for my
own book -- Don't know what they're like these days --

Meanwhile, near any college campus you will find copy companies that produce
"readers" instructors assemble for their students -- Many of these companies
purport to get permissions for the professor -- many of them are doing no such
thing --

It us perfectly legal for an instructor to make a copy of an entire poem for
every student in the class -- it is illegal to do this again and again with the
same poem, as it is illegal to assemble your own anthology from such copies and
have the studetns buy it at the copy shop, unless somebody has gotten copyright
clearances --

there are some copy shops that actually do what they say they're doing and get
the clearance for you - blessings to them for doing so --

Alison Croggon asks:
<< Am I right in assuming (I haven't been following this discussion very
closely) that this is related to the Poetics policy saying that sexist
abuse
is as unwelcome as racist abuse? >>

Hi Alison,

Actually no, so happens you're not right in so assuming.

Though I'm by no means a thorough Poetics-list reader myself,
I did hap to take note of the posts antecedent to the one
that you're replying to here -- David-Baptiste Chirot's.
Or at least I noticed enough of 'em to see what's up (and what
you've in fact misconstrued).

Simply as a fellow reader, I am thus in the position of being
able to disabuse you of your erroneous (though quite interesting
in its own thoughts) reading of his post.  What DBC was discussing
in fact had nothing at all to do with the Poetics list or policies
about suitable and unsuitable postings.  Rather, what he was
musing over involved the last several posts (in the past two
or more days) from a longer, ongoing exchange about the late
Charles Bukowski and the question of that poet's attitudes about
or, in the instance, behavior toward women.  CA Conrad had been,
for a number of days, arguing in defense of Bukowski, praising
Bukowski, lionizing Bukowsky, and also repeatedly remarking to the
effect that may Bukowski may have been salty and wild in his
language but as a man, he was invariably decent (or, at a minimum,
non-violent) in his behavior toward members of the fair sex (if

deem it) came crashing to the ground, for the good Conrad, with this

<< A good friend of mine (I didn't think to ask permission to use their

told me yesterday afternoon about a documentary (is it new I wonder?)
where Bukowski is physically abusive to a woman ON CAMERA!

that I apologize for having defended Bukowski here and many other

good points, all! thanks.
for a traditional anthology, Poulin & Waters' Contemp. Am Poetry isn't bad &
at least includes Ashbery, Creeley, Ginsberg, Hass, Kizer, Merrill, O'Hara,
Palmer, Rich, & CD Wright, as well as the usual suspects, and it has pix.
Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women is wonderful,
if you are going to  use more than one text.
I always send my students to the Buffalo website to listen to poets before
class in Contemp. Am. Poetry courses but for poetry workshop, too. And Ubu
and Penn. And ask them to go to 2 poetry readings. Plus I ask at least one
poet to come to class each term--Happy Birthday this weekend, dear Creeley,
who came a few times & thrilled the students.
also I ask that each student talk for a few mins. abt a poet s/he likes, &
hand out copies of his/her poems.

run some local political coverage, but going outside of that geography for
an editor is doable.

the politics editor would be responsible for filling one page each issue an=

have great latitude to its contents.

if you have any ideas, send =B9em this way.

Look, if "students" don't like reading poetry,
don't let them take a creative writing course.

Or, could iut be that such courses are there to employ
creative writing teachers?

Mark,

small quibble for what worth.

I may be wrong, but I believe the right to TRANSLATE (per se, not to
publish)
belongs to anybody who knows any language and wants to translate
anything that
they happen to get their mits on.  Right to PUBLISH such a translation
would
indeed require the steps you note: permission of the copyright owner.

The question of whether the same issue about publishing rights that one
encounters when xeroxing published works, would adhere to an
"UNPUBLISHED"
translation that a teacher may wish to circulate to her students, --
that
question seems to me to be an unclear puzzle, legal precedents (if any)
regarding which, could be explored.

I could at least hypothesise (and maybe I will) that it may be a
different
situation.  Though I can see an argument that could propose otherwise.

We now resume regular silencio.

cheers,
d.i.

Those of you who revere Sorrentino's work as much as I do will be saddened to hear he died yesterday, of heart problems brought on by other medical problems that have plagued him over the last year. A brilliant novelist, a superb critic, he will be missed. Those of you who don't know his work might try <Aberration of Starlight> or <Mulligan Stew.> His latest work of fiction, <A Strange Commonplace,> was just published a few months ago.

Headline:  In poetry-loving Yemen, tribal bard takes on Al Qaeda - with his
Byline:  James Brandon Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor
Date: 05/12/2006

(SANAA, YEMEN)As the dusk call to prayer fades, Amin al-Mashreqi =20
glances at the
expectant faces surrounding him and begins to read from his slim,
handwritten book of verse that is helping to bring a measure of peace
to this mountainous Arab country.

O, you who kidnap our guests,
Your house will refuse you,
These violations are against Islam

Crammed into a mud-brick shop, his audience, some with their hands
resting on their gold-trimmed daggers, listen to his verse denouncing
violence and Islamic militancy. When he finishes, there is silence.
Then the room erupts in applause.

"Other countries fight terrorism with guns and bombs, but in Yemen we
use poetry," says Mr. Mashreqi later. "Through my poetry I can convince
people of the need for peace who would never be convinced by laws or by
force."

For years Yemen has been known as a breeding ground for extremism. It
is the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden and where Al Qaeda bombed
the USS Cole in 2000.

But today this country is quietly winning a reputation for using
unorthodox tactics to take on Islamic militancy.

"Yemen has turned to poets because they are able to speak to diverse
groups of people who the literati and the elite cannot reach," explains
W. Flagg Miller, professor of Anthropology and Religious Studies at the
University of Wisconsin who has studied Yemeni poetry for about 20
years.

For centuries, Yemen's rulers have relied on poets like Mashreqi to
take the government's message into remote areas where regular soldiers
and officials feared to tread - and where using force could create
more, and angrier, enemies.

"There is a long tradition of leaders turning to poets right across the
Arab world," explains Dr. Miller. "The prophet Muhammad himself worked
with a poet, Hassan ibn Thabit, to spread the word and compose poetry
against other poets and tribes who refused to acknowledge Islam."

But the long and rich history of Yemeni polemical poetry, the idea of
using tribal poets to fight extremism began with a chance meeting
nearly two years ago, explains Faris Sanabani, a friend of Yemen's
president and editor of a weekly English-language newspaper The Yemen
Observer.

Leading Yemenis in Sanaa had gathered to chew khat, a narcotic shrub,
talk politics, and listen to poetry, Mr. Sanabani recalls. Suddenly,
one guest turned to Yemen's most popular tribal poet, Mashreqi, and
asked him if he could recite any poetry about terrorism, he says.

Mashreqi rose eagerly to the challenge. He stood up, adjusted the
broad, curving dagger hanging at his waist and proudly declaimed a
handful of verses glorifying suicide bombers.

As the applause faded, the man who had asked him to recite the verses,
Sanabani himself, took him aside and quietly invited him to visit his
office.

The next day at the office of the Yemen Observer, Sanabani asked
Mashreqi to watch a video made after Al Qaeda's 2002 suicide
boat-attack on the French oil tanker SS Limburg off the Yemeni coast.

"I showed him footage of the environmental damage caused by the oil
spill and of Yemeni fishermen and their families whose livelihood had
been destroyed because their fishing grounds were polluted," recalls
Sanabani.

Chastened by the images of oil-stained beaches, dead fish, and seabirds
and sobbing, destitute Yemeni fishermen, Mashreqi left Sanabani's
office appearing troubled and lost in thought. When Sanabani next saw
him he seemed a man transformed.

"Three days later he came back with the most beautiful poetry I have
ever seen," says Sanabani, recalling his amazement at the poet's new
verses that now condemned violence and promoted peace and tolerance.

Sanabani and Mashreqi realized that the historic respect accorded to
poets gives them a unique power to win over illiterate tribesmen in
remote areas where villagers are traditionally skeptical of all that
the government has to say and offer.

"The Yemeni people are very sensitive to poetry - especially
traditional poetry like this," says Mashreqi. "If poetry contains the
right ideas and is used in the right context, then people will respond
to it because this is heart of their culture."

And although Yemen has used force to tackle Al Qaeda cells and rebel
groups, Mashreqi's poems also fit into Yemen's wider strategy of
defeating Islamic extremism by appealing to their countrymen's sense of
pride, honor, and patriotism.

O men of arms, why do you love injustice?
You must live in law and order
Get up, wake up, or be forever regretful,
Don't be infamous among the nations

The poems, however, also robustly argue that carrying out terrorist
attacks in Yemen will succeed in scaring away much-needed foreign
investment and tourism - an argument that few impoverished Yemenis can
dispute.

"You have to talk to people about the dangers and effects of
terrorism," says Ahmed al-Kibsi, professor of political science at
Sanaa University. "Education, the media, and the military complement
each other."

So far Yemen's tactics seem to be helping. Since Yemen's President Ali
Abdullah Saleh joined President Bush's War on Terror in late 2001 the
country has not experienced any major Islamist attacks - although
internal tribal conflicts regularly flare up, as does a long-running
Shiite Muslim uprising in the country's far north.

But while there have been few successful attacks by Islamic militants
in Yemen, the country has still had its troubles with Al Qaeda.

In February, at least 23 suspected and convicted Al Qaeda members
escaped from a jail in Sanaa. The Yemen Observer reported that, "some
of the escapees were the most important and dangerous members of
Yemen's Al Qaeda network, and have been blamed for bombing the USS Cole
warship in Aden."

Also, there may have been other unintended side effects of Yemen's
successful campaign to persuade would-be jihadists not to carry out
their attacks on Yemeni soil.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that many Yemenis have instead traveled to
Iraq to fight against the US-led occupation. In the anti-Soviet jihad
in Afghanistan in the 1980s, Yemenis are said to have made up the
second largest contingents of Arab volunteers.

Others worry that while Yemen has succeeded in suppressing the visible
symptoms of Islamic militancy, the root causes of violent radicalism
remain and the Islamic militancy in the country is not defeated but is
instead merely dormant.

Rising poverty, a lack of opportunity, and the arrogance and corruption
of an increasingly authoritarian ruling class mean that Yemen's victory
over terrorism may be only temporary.

"I've become aware of a real anger on the streets," says Robin Madrid,
resident director of the National Democratic Institute's program in
Yemen, adding that many Yemenis can despairingly point out second and
third homes built by government ministers.

"Yemen has the potential to make excellent progress on all the fronts
that we're concerned about," says Nabeel Khoury, deputy chief of
mission at the US Embassy, Sanaa, citing Yemen's need to tackle
corruption and international arms smuggling while also extending
democratization and protecting press freedom.

"At the same time, Yemen faces so many serious challenges that if it
doesn't make the right decisions it risks deterioration on all these
fronts," says Mr. Khoury, "with potential consequences for domestic as
well as regional stability."

I just got a couple samples from them.  Very generic quality, nothing
that I would want to use.  It took them days to get ahold of me just
to return my email.  Cold, impersonal. That's my take.  I highly
recommend bookmobile.com over this.

This is kinda tired, this way of thinking, I wonder. And, clearly, I might be wrong. But I find it difficult to surmise that Creeley was a woman-hater -- or that Bukowski was more than, say, a deeply troubled individual. I mean, it's a thing to use a word until it leads itself and one to uselessness. I could easily say, it I wanted to be strict (extremely politcal and agenda-oriented) that most folk I meet are both rascist and homophobic (but only if I chose that term most easily leading me to that uselessness).

ABOUT THE GHETTO AND OTHER POEMS:

The Ghetto and Other Poems, Lola Ridge=92s major collection of poems, =20=

was first published in New York  by B.W. Huebsch in 1918.  This study =20=

of the Lower East Side immigrant subcultures by an Australian-born =20
radical activist is a classic work of poetry and urban studies. Long =20
available for free online, this new Factory School Southpaw Culture =20
edition, developed as a gift to the students of New York, is =20
available once again in book form.

Here's an excerpt from what one of her friends at the Modern School =20
of Stelton said of The Ghetto and Other Poems in their January 1919 =20
review:

=93Two Lola Ridges are revealed in her book. One is the artist. The =20
other is the radical. Sometimes the two are merged. In =91The Ghetto=92 =20=

the primary interest lies in Miss Ridge=92s powers of observation and =20=

in the originality of her report. Others of her poems owe their chief =20=

interest to her passionate sympathy with the under-dog and with all =20
the movements that make for rebellion and freedom. Lola Ridge makes =20
no plea for popular favor. She knows, as every revolutionary knows, =20
that only a few will understand, and that fewer still will like what =20
she has to offer. Her dedication is =91To the American People=92 in =
these =20
lines:

Will you feast with me, American People?
But what have I that shall seem good to you!

On my board are bitter apples
And honey served on thorns,
And in my flagons fluid iron,
Hot from the crucibles.
How should such fare entice you!

=93A certain bitter quality pervades the entire book. Night hangs over =20=

it. Cold winds chill it. Livid faces peer through it. Hoboes, =20
derelicts, outcasts, are described in crisp little phrases that bite =20
deep into the mind. Flaming indignation against cruelty and =20
injustice; the fighting spirit of labor; the multi-colored dreams of =20
idealists appear as a foil to these drab portrayals of the under-=20
world. The deepest note of the book is an unfaltering loyalty to the =20
revolutionary ideal.=94

 "Nick Moudry is the rare poet who has found a way to incorporate formal elegance into work with a “conceptual” edge. His long poem “High noon”, released as a chapbook by Indivia in 2005, is at once an elegiac meditation on the fall of America, an indictment of the “cowboy” mentality that has precipitated this fall, a whimsical Surrealistic exploration of “self & non-self”, an exercise in economical melopoeia & a mysterious beacon from an elusive sensibility."

  Nick Moudry's long-ish poem "High noon" is now up at PFS Post (www.artrecess.blogspot.com). Check it out!!

I have never forgotten a reading he did years ago at the Library of Congress.
He had sent a handout in prior to the reading, replete with typos and other

Thanks to all of you for your fine anthology
suggestions. This year's winner of the anthology Mark
Wallace will try next year is (drum roll):

Sleeping On The Wing, ed. by Kenneth Koch and Kate
Farrell.

The winning suggestion was turned in by Ethan Paquin.
No prize this year, Ethan, I'm sorry to say. I used to
give away cars but then I realized I was just a
college professor. But thanks very much anyway!

I didn't know about this anthology, but it looks
pretty great. We'll see what happens.

I only met Kenneth Koch a few times; he was always
nattily dressed, formal and polite, perhaps a little
distant; he struck me as being from a high culture New
York art world from which I felt very far removed. Yet
in this anthology and some others he edited, he shows
a rare ability to talk about and frame poetry in a way
designed to speak to those who know little or nothing
about it while neither being condescending or
simplifying his sense of what poetry should be. To me,
that's pretty impressive.

Thanks again, everybody--

Mark

Hip Hop: 'Beyond Beats and Rhymes'

<mailto:montfu65@hotmail.com>

    "My film challenges the idea that in order to be a successful rapper
    in Hip-Hop you have to be hard, tough, violent, sexist, and
    homophobic," Hurt told AllHipHop.com. "I've shown this film to
    audiences all over the country, and the first thing people say to me
    afterward are 'Thank you so much for making this film' or, 'This
    film needs to be seen everywhere, especially in the hood.'"

Mos Def, Fat Joe, Jadakiss and Busta Rhymes Go "Beyond Beats and Rhymes"
By Remmie Fresh
Date: 5/19/2006 12:00 pm

An independent filmmaker has crafted a film that enlists the likes of
Mos Def, Fat Joe, Chuck D, Jadakiss, Busta Rhymes, Russell Simmons, and
activists such as Michael Eric Dyson, Beverly Guy-Sheftall, and aspiring
Congressional candidate Kevin Powell, who offer earnest critique about
Hip-Hop lifestyle.

Beyond Beats and Rhymes: A Hip-Hop Head Weighs in on Manhood in Rap
Music is a 2006 Sundance Film Festival selection?that was produced and
directed by Byron Hurt, a gender violence prevention educator.

With his film, Hurt is bent on confronting the societal concerns and
community interests as it pertains to the influential culture.

"My film challenges the idea that in order to be a successful rapper in
Hip-Hop you have to be hard, tough, violent, sexist, and homophobic,"
Hurt told AllHipHop.com. "I've shown this film to audiences all over the
country, and the first thing people say to me afterward are 'Thank you
so much for making this film' or, 'This film needs to be seen
everywhere, especially in the hood.'"

Beyond Beats and Rhymes made its debut in New York City last night at
the "Sundance at BAM (Brooklyn Academy of Music) Film Series" and will
offer more screenings on May 19 and 21. Additionally, the acclaimed film
will air nationally on PBS in early 2007.

Hurt also said that while his movie has been years in the making, the
subject matter and examination are only becoming more relevant.

"The recent shooting deaths of Proof, Busta Rhymes' bodyguard Israel
Ramirez, T.I.'s personal assistant Philant Johnson, as well as rapper
Gravy getting shot in the butt outside of New York's Hot 97 sadly
reminds us in the Hip-Hop community [that] manhood and Hip-Hop are too
closely associated with senseless violence," Hurt continued.? "Morning
shock jock Star's comments directed toward D.J. Envy's wife and
daughter, which led to his well-publicized firing at New York City's
Power 105.1, clearly reveal that some men's attitudes about girls and
women in mainstream Hip-Hop are raging out of control."

While the 60-minute film examines Hip-Hop, it doesn't ignore the overall
scope of the Black male experience in the United States, as it addresses
misogyny, violence, and homophobia.

"I know that Byron's current project on Hip-Hop is close to his
heart.?It reflects his on-going effort to use film to address essential
concerns on the intent and impact of popular youth culture," said
filmmaker Orlando Bagwell in a statement. "His film will pose
fundamental questions about how Hip-Hop culture represents and expresses
basic attitudes in our society about love, violence, and compassion."?

The Brooklyn Academy of Music is screening the film.

Today we celebrate the life and times of Malcolm X. Included in this 30
minute audio mix are excerpts from his speeches which underscore is
outlook and philosophy. We also have keen commentary from people like
Sista Souljah and the late Ossie Davis..

Below is some good information about Malcolm X

Malcolm Little was born on May 19, 1925, in Omaha, Nebraska, the son of
Louise and Earl Little. Louise Little, born of biracial heritage, was a
native of Grenada in the British West Indies. Earl Little, a six-foot
described as very powerful in appearance, was born Georgia where he
worked as a Baptist minister and organizer for Marcus Garvey. A staunch
Garveyite, Earl Little believed strongly in ideas of black-nationalism
and pan-Africanism. Louise, his second wife, bore six children: Wilfred,
Hilda, Philbert, Malcolm, Yvonne, and Reginald. Earl Little also had
three children by a first wife: Ella, Earl, and Mary. Because of
Little's advocacy for Garvey's movement, his family was terrorized by
the Ku Klux Klan and other whites. To avoid any more violent harassment
by these elements Little moved his family to Lansing, Michigan. However
the racism proved impossible to escape. In Lansing white racists placed
a beaten Earl Little on a railway track where he was killed by an
oncoming train. They claimed he committed suicide.

His father's early death at the hands of whites would leave he and his
seven siblings alone with their mother. The stress of the times placed
his mother in a mental institution and Malcolm was sent to a foster
home. Malcolm attended school until eighth grade living with different
families. When a white teacher stopped him from trying to become a
lawyer, he dropped out of school entirely. After years of transfers to
state institutions and boarding houses, Malcolm moved to live with his
sister Ella in Boston. Here, he took a job as a shoeshine boy at the
Roseland Ballroom. But such a lowly status did not suit Malcolm and he
soon took up the role of a hustler, peddling narcotics and engaging in
petty thefts. Malcolm even took to straightening his hair and dating
white women. But Roxbury proved to be too small for him, and in 1942 he
took a job as a railroad dining car porter, working out of Roxbury and
New York. Settling in Harlem, New York, he became more involved in
criminal activities: robbing, selling narcotics and even working as a
pimp. In Harlem he also got his nickname "Detroit Red", because his
hometown Lansing was close to Detroit and his hair was red. After a year
in Harlem, Malcolm was officially initiated into hustler society. He
returned to Boston in 1945 after falling out with another hustler, and
continued a life of crime, forming his own house robbing gang. Arrested
for robbery in February 1946, he was convicted and sentenced to prison
for seven years.

While in prison, Malcolm became a follower of Elijah Muhammad, the then
leader of the Lost Found Nation of Islam, with branches in Detroit,
Chicago and New York. Malcolm and Elijah Muhammad corresponded by mail
while in prison. Malcolm's brothers Philbert and Reginald, visiting him
in jail, convinced him to join the NOI and follow the teachings of
Elijah Muhammad. Following NOI policies, Malcolm soon discarded what he
deemed his "slave name", Little, and took the new name "X" to symbolize
his lost and unknown name. He improved his knowledge base by reading
extensively while in jail as well as studying from the Qu'ran and
following strictly the Nation of Islam's dietary laws and moral codes.

After his parole in 1952, Malcolm X undertook organizational work for
the Nation of Islam under the guidance of Elijah Muhammad. As a minister
Malcolm founded mosques in Boston, Philadelphia, Harlem and elsewhere
and made the national expansion of the movement possible. Malcolm's
ideology was expressed in his fiery orations, newspaper columns as well
as radio and television interviews. In addition, he helped to found the
NOI newspaper Muhammad Speaks. Malcolm was said to be the only black man
who "could stop a race riot - or start one". Due to his influences, NOI
membership reached approximately 30,000 by 1963. In January 1958 he
married Betty X, who was also a member of the Nation of Islam.

Malcolm's rise in power became a threat to competing NOI ministers and
especially to the U.S. government who, through the FBI, kept extensive
files upon him. Disobeying direct NOI orders to remain silent on the
matter of John F. Kennedy's assassination, Malcolm stated it was a case
of "chickens coming home to roost". This resulted in his suspension from
his NOI post and his eventual split with the organization and his father
figure, Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm went on to form his own groups, Muslim
Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. Outside of the
NOI Malcolm continued his messages of Black Nationalism, independence,
and self-defense. His ideas of racial separation were modified but his
ideas of white society and racism were by no means drastically altered
in his last few years. As one scholar put it, "Malcolm never let white
people off the hook". He did however see the possibility of working with
other progressive black groups.

During this time Malcolm began to advocate a more pragmatic black
nationalism, stating that blacks should control the politics within
their own community. At the height of his power Malcolm was one of black
America's most powerful voices. He traveled widely in Europe and Africa
attempting to link the black struggle in America with those abroad. At
one point he even advocated and prepared to take the United States
before the United Nations for charges of "genocide" against its black
citizens. In 1964 Malcolm made a pilgrimage to Mecca, obligatory for
orthodox Muslims, where upon he changed his name to El-Hajj Malik
El-Shabazz.

On February 21, 1964 in front of a crowd in the Audubon Ballroom in New
York City, Malcolm X was shot to death by three men. Labeled as angry
NOI members, the three were convicted with Malcolm's death. However a
host of suspicious events and contradictory information presented at the
trial have led many to speculate whether more sinister forces, namely
the US government, may have been behind his death. The only acquaintance
of Malcolm to attempt to prove this point immediately following death,
Leon Ameer, died of a sleeping pill overdose before his case could be
presented. Thus Malcolm's life, like his death, has remained shrouded in
mystery. But even beyond death, El Hajj Malik El-Shabazz inspired
generations for decades to come. His views and ideologies on black
nationalism and Pan-Africanism would be picked up by many. His
fascinating life, teachings, and tragic death would make him both a
martyr and a model for the era of Black Power that was soon to come.

Our own Black Shining Prince: 80th anniversary of Malik Shabazz's birthday


Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him or have him
smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean
thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public
disturbance? For if you did, you would know him. And if you knew him,
you would know why we must honor him: Malcolm was our manhood, our
living, black manhood!--ossie davis



"We have a common enemy. We have this in common: We have a common
oppressor, a common exploiter, and a common discriminator. But once we
all realize that we have this common enemy, then we unite on the basis
of what we have in common. And what we have foremost in common is that
enemy..."-- Malcolm X: "Message To The Grass Roots"

from 'message to the grassroots

"We all agree tonight, all of the speakers have agreed, that America has
a very serious problem. Not only does America have a very serious
problem, but our people have a very serious problem. America's problem
is us. We're her problem. The only reason she has a problem is she
doesn't want us here. And every time you look at yourself, be you black,
brown, red, or yellow -- a so-called Negro -- you represent a person who
poses such a serious problem for America because you're not wanted."

"I would like to make a few comments concerning the difference between
the black revolution and the Negro revolution. There's a difference. Are
they both the same? And if they're not, what is the difference? What is
the difference between a black revolution and a Negro revolution? First,
what is a revolution? Sometimes I'm inclined to believe that many of our
people are using this word "revolution" loosely, without taking careful
consideration [of] what this word actually means, and what its historic
characteristics are. When you study the historic nature of revolutions,
the motive of a revolution, the objective of a revolution, and the
result of a revolution, and the methods used in a revolution, you may
change words. You may devise another program. You may change your goal
and you may change your mind."

"If violence is wrong in America, violence is wrong abroad. If it's
wrong to be violent defending black women and black children and black
babies and black men, then it's wrong for America to draft us and make
us violent abroad in defense of her. And if it is right for America to
draft us, and teach us how to be violent in defense of her, then it is
right for you and me to do whatever is necessary to defend our own
people right here in this country."

objective as the victory of Black nationalism, where does that leave
him? Where does that leave revolutionaries in Morocco, Egypt, Iraq,
Mauritania? So he showed me where I was alienating people who were true

The Islamic-Arab world ...provided Malcolm with a pastoral vision of a
world morally superior to America, at least insofar as human and racial
relationships are concerned. By returning to America to realize his new
vision through social action, Malcolm showed that he belonged to the
tradition of historical revolutionaries who want to alter reality, not
by transcending or breaking away from it, but by reshaping it according
to their vision of the "good life." ...Allah in the Koran says that His
hand is always with the community rather than with the individual. --

Malcolm X reminds us all, of the ongoing war at home. He reminds us that
voting is but one (and that a minor) part of politics. That it is
important to speak truth to power. That is important, indeed vital, to
dissent. That it is necessary, sometimes, to step outside of a thing to
see it clearly. And that political organizations have different
interests from those who vote for them. -- Mumia Abu-Jamal -- "MALCOLM
X'S RAP OF DEMOCRATS"

"Malcolm X was not murdered because he called white people devils
(others had done that) or because he had a public falling out with
Elijah Muhammad, (although the US government through its COINTELPRO used
that situation to promote his "neutralization") Malcolm X was murdered
because he had the courage boldness and audacity to attempt to bring the
United States of AmeriKKKa before the United Nations' World Court for
its crimes of genocide, human rights violations and its racist
imperialist foreign policies." -- Junious Ricardo Stanton -- "Malcolm X
vs. US Imperialism"

http://victoria.indymedia.org/news/2005/05/40850.php

The Malcolm X who lived, struggled, was imprisoned, followed by the FBI
(and other government agencies), whose words were like pepper in the
bloody scars of America, became transformed, over time, into someone
that he would barely recognize: a 'civil rights' activist; instead of a
nationalist, a freedom fighter, a rebel to white nationalism, and, in
his own words, one who fought for 'human rights.'... But while the Black
bourgeoisie 'couldn't understand' the meaning of Malcolm's loss, Black
poor and working class people certainly could. He was one of *us*, they
reasoned, and his loss was our loss. -- Mumia Abu-Jamal -- "IN MALCOLMS
MEMORY"

To come right down to it, if I take the kind of things in which I
believe, then add to that the kind of temperament that I have, plus the
one hundred per cent dedication that I have to whatever I believe in-
these are ingredients which make it just about impossible for me to die
of old age ... I know that societies have often killed the people who
have helped to change those societies."--Malik Shabazz -- "The Legacy of

Dear Herb Levy,
Thank you for your post.
In the current Jacket magazine there is a feature on
Gilbert Sorrentino edited by Australian poet Ken
Bolton -

Those working at Jacket magazine were aware of his
fragile health in recent months and are saddened to
hear of his death.

Those of you who revere Sorrentino's work as much as I
do will be
saddened to hear he died yesterday, of heart problems
brought on by other
medical problems that have plagued him over the last
year. A brilliant
novelist, a superb critic, he will be missed. Those of
you who don't know
his work might try <Aberration of Starlight> or
<Mulligan Stew.> His
latest work of fiction, <A Strange Commonplace,> was
just published a few
months ago.

On the Fluxlist, Rod Stasick has been getting everyone up to speed on
true mesostics.  I found his step by step instructional quite
helpful.  Some years back I had created a tribute to Dick Higgins
after he died, using his "foew&ombwhnw" as a source text.  I had read
many of Cage's mesostics but never the precise procedure he used to
create them,  & I see now that my own mesostics are now bastard
creations...

Sure, no prob. These thing are sometimes easier to present in person.
Remember these are the two kinds:

-50 percent mesostics: between any two mesoletters, you can't have
the second

and

-100 percent mesostics: between any two mesoletters, you can't have
either.



Let's use "The Gettysburg Address" as the source text and LINCOLN as
the spine:


Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation
or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. We are
met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a
portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here
gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether
fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense, we
cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.
The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it
far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little
note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what
they did here.

It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished
work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It
is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to
that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--
that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in
vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom,
and that government of the people, by the people, for the people
shall not perish from the earth.



OK, so we start from the beginning of the text and look for a word
that has an "L" (our first mesoletter)

but no "I" because the next instance of an "I" will be the next
mesoletter. We find the word "aLl" - notice that we can't use
"liberty" because an "i" follows in the same word. OK, so we start
our mesostic with "aLl"

...now, continuing in the text, we find the next word that has an
"I", remembering that our following letter "N"

will be in the next line...and so on...

As for the "wing words", you can have as many as you want as long as
they don't break the rules.

Wing words on the right of your spine can't have the FOLLOWING
mesoletter included anywhere in it's phrase

and wing words on the left of the spine cannot have the PREVIOUS
mesoletter included anywhere in it's phrase.



So, let's do "LINCOLN" just once and only use one word for each line
(no wing words - we can add those later),

we get (if I can line the letters up - MUCH easier on paper!):



			aLl

			cIvil

		    testiNg

		     dediCated

			lOng

		     battLefield

		   portioN



By the way, when you come to the last letter in your spine,

you act as if you are going to start your spine word over.

In other words, for "LINCOLN" when you come to the last letter - "N" -

you are searching for a word that has an "N", that is not followed by
a "L" (your first letter in "LINCOLN").



OK, so let's add some "wing words". There are some exceptions in a
few of his works, but, generally, John made no rules about length of
the wing words. You can have none...or you can have lots...as long as
it doesn't break the mesostic rule that we've been speaking of -
repeated letters before the mesoletters. Wing words can be added to
make a particular point or create your own special slant on what is
or can be said. Punctuation can be implied by it's absence. For example:



			aLl men are created

			cIvil

		    testiNg whether that nation

		  so dediCated

		    can	lOng endure

	     a great battLefield

		 a portioN of that



		      fieLd		[and so on...]



This is an example of choosing wing words that

allows you to convey, let's say, a patriotic meaning,

but, in another instance, you may be able to add just enough wing
words to

give some *other* implied meaning to the text.



and so it goes...

apologies for this second non-Boog/poetry email about my available Mets tix,
but i thought i'd check back in as the games were getting closer.

hi all,

So I've renewed my Mets Sunday plan for the 2006 season and I thought I'd
see if any of you might be interested in buying any tickets (and, as a
bonus, get the poetic mojo by sitting in the same place where Jim Behrle,
Jordan Davis, and Jean-Paul Pecqueur have sat in years past). I've been
sitting in the same section for the past eight, now nine, years--mezzanine,
sec. 2 (behind home plate). I have two tickets for each game (prices below
are per pair), and they're under the overhang, so u don't get burned by the
sun or wet from the rain.

If you're interested in buying any tickets you can email me here. (Note that
the Mets charge different prices depending upon the opponents and the date,
so you'll see, for example, that the Marlins game costs more than the
Orioles game.)

hope this finds you well (and lets go mets!)

as ever,
david

"Snarl"

(with apologies to Allen Ginsberg)
for Dick & Karl

I saw the worst minds of my generation, destroying badness, greedy
hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the neocon streets at dawn
looking for WMD,
devilhearted bastards burning from the ancient family connection to the
money dynamo in the machinery of darkness,
who overmonied, overclothed, overfed and drunk sat up plotting in the
soul-destroying darkness of Crawford ranch crawling beneath the depths
of evil contemplating nothing,
who claimed a lock on Heaven while pushing Hell and seeing Iraqi
civilians slaughtered on Baghdad streets unlighted
who passed through universities with empty cold eyes hallucinating Texas
and Manson-dark murder among the scholars of war,
who weren't expelled from the academies for crazy & puerile obscene
rituals of the Bones and Skull,
who cowered in the Oval Office unaware, burning our money in wanton war
and fabricating Terror for us all

"The National Uniform Law" is not real. Just like a lot of news these days.

.
http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-17/0605206372115739.htm

Iran denies dress code alleged in Canadian daily
New York, May 20, IRNA

Iran-Canada-Daily
Iran has denied a report in a Canadian daily which says Tehran may force
non-Muslims to adopt a particular dress code in public.

In a letter to the Canadian daily `National Post', the press attache of the
Iranian embassy in Ottawa, Hormoz Qahramani, rejected the article.

The daily, in an article published in its Friday edition, said that "a new
dress-code reportedly passed in Iran this past week mandates the
government to make sure that religious minorities -- Christians, Jews and
Zoroastrians -- will have to adopt distinct colour schemes to make them
identifiable in public."

The article further states that "the Iranian government has envisioned that
all Iranians wear standard Islamic garments designed to remove ethnic
and class distinctions."

According to the article, under the proposed dress code law, which is still
awaiting final approval by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, "Jews will have to wear a yellow band on their exterior in
public, (Zoroastrians blue), while Christians will be required to don red
ones."

Qahramani's letter stressed that such accusations against the Islamic
Republic of Iran are part of a vast pre-planned move against Iran by certain
countries or individuals.

In related developments, the representative of the Jewish minority in the
Islamic Consultative Assembly (Majlis), Maurice Motamed, also
dismissed the article as a "complete fabrication." Interviewed by a
western news agency, he said the alleged dress requirement was a lie
and people who concocted it intended to achieve certain political ends.

The publication of such reports outside Iran is an insult to the religious
minorities living in Iran, Motamed added.

Maybe a few of you have already seen this one.
---

By MARK STEVENSON
Associated Press Writer

MEXICO CITY

If Arnold Schwarzenegger had migrated to Mexico
instead of the United States, he couldn't be a
governor. If Argentina native Sergio Villanueva,
firefighter hero of the Sept. 11 attacks, had moved to
Tecate instead of New York, he wouldn't have been
allowed on the force.

Even as Mexico presses the United States to grant
unrestricted citizenship to millions of undocumented
Mexican migrants, its officials at times calling U.S.
policies "xenophobic," Mexico places daunting
limitations on anyone born outside its territory.

In the United States, only two posts _ the presidency
and vice presidency _ are reserved for the native
born.

In Mexico, non-natives are banned from those and
thousands of other jobs, even if they are legal,
naturalized citizens.

Foreign-born Mexicans can't hold seats in either house
of the congress. They're also banned from state
legislatures, the Supreme Court and all governorships.
Many states ban foreign-born Mexicans from spots on
town councils. And Mexico's Constitution reserves
almost all federal posts, and any position in the
military and merchant marine, for "native-born
Mexicans."

Recently the Mexican government has gone even further.
Since at least it has encouraged cities to ban
non-natives from such local jobs as firefighters,
police and judges.

Mexico's Interior Department _ which recommended the
bans as part of "model" city statutes it distributed
to local officials _ could cite no basis for extending
the bans to local posts.

After being contacted by The Associated Press about
the issue, officials changed the wording in two
statutes to delete the "native- born" requirements,
although they said the modifications had nothing to do
with AP's inquiries.

"These statutes have been under review for some time,
and they have, or are about to be, changed," said an
Interior Department official, who was not authorized
to be quoted by name.

But because the "model" statues are fill-in-the-blanks
guides for framing local legislation, many cities
across Mexico have already enacted such bans. They
have done so even though foreigners constitute a tiny
percentage of the population and pose little threat to
Mexico's job market.

The foreign-born make up just 0.5 percent of Mexico's
105 million people, compared with about 13 percent in
the United States, which has a total population of 299
million. Mexico grants citizenship to about 3,000
people a year, compared to the U.S. average of almost
a half million.

"There is a need for a little more openness, both at
the policy level and in business affairs," said David
Kim, president of the Mexico- Korea Association, which
represents the estimated 20,000 South Koreans in
Mexico, many of them naturalized citizens.

"The immigration laws are very difficult ... and they
put obstacles in the way that make it more difficult
to compete," Kim said, although most foreigners don't
come to Mexico seeking government posts.

J. Michael Waller, of the Center for Security Policy
in Washington, was more blunt. "If American
policy-makers are looking for legal models on which to
base new laws restricting immigration and expelling
foreign lawbreakers, they have a handy guide: the
Mexican constitution," he said in a recent article on
immigration.

Some Mexicans agree their country needs to change.

"This country needs to be more open," said Francisco
Hidalgo, a 50- year-old video producer. "In part to
modernize itself, and in part because of the
contribution these (foreign-born) people could make."

Others express a more common view, a distrust of
foreigners that academics say is rooted in Mexico's
history of foreign invasions and the loss of territory
in the 1847-48 Mexican-American War.

Speaking of the hundreds of thousands of Central
Americans who enter Mexico each year, chauffeur
Arnulfo Hernandez, 57, said: "The ones who want to
reach the United States, we should send them up there.
But the ones who want to stay here, it's usually for
bad reasons, because they want to steal or do drugs."

Some say progress is being made. Mexico's president no
longer is required to be at least a second-generation
native-born. That law was changed in 1999 to clear the
way for candidates who have one foreign- born parent,
like President Vicente Fox, whose mother is from
Spain.

But the pace of change is slow. The state of Baja
California still requires candidates for the state
legislature to prove both their parents were native
born.

Charles "Hank" Bukowski was indeed deeply troubled. For example,
(http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001977/bio) he flirted with fascism in
his youth -

"Charles Bukowski, the American poet, short-story writer, and
novelist, was born Heinrich Karl Bukowski, Jr. in Andernach, Germany
on August 1920. He was the son of Henry Bukowski, a US soldier who was
part of the post-World War I occupation force, and Katharina Fett, a
German woman.
...
At City College, Bukwoski briefly flirted with a pathetic, ad hoc,
pro-fascist student group. Proud of being a German, he did not feel
inclined to go to war against Hitler's Germany. When America entered
World War II, Bukowski resisted entreaties from his friends and father
to join the service. He began living the life of a wandering hobo and
a bum, frequently living on skid row as he worked his way through a
meaningless series of jobs in L.A. and other cities across the U.S. He
wound up in New York City during the war after his short story,
'Aftermath of a Lengthy Rejection Slip,' was accepted by "Story"
magazine. He disliked New York and soon decamped for more hospitable
climes. He was content to go to public libraries and read -- he
discovered the L.A. writer John Fante, whom heavily influenced his own
work and whom he would champion when he became famous -- and loaf."

The article goes onto say that although B admired Celine did not
descend to Celine's ant-semitism. How did he avoid conscription? I'm
reading Roth's "the Plot Against America" which is an interesting
conjunction at this point for me.

And as for B's relationships with women...

"Around the time he quit the Post Office, Bukowski took up with the
poet and sculptress Linda King, who was 20 years his junior. They
began a tumultuous relationship juiced in equal parts with sadism and
masochism that extended into the mid-1970s. In his 1978
autobiographical novel "Women," Bukowski writes about how his alter
ego, "Henry Chinaski," had not had a woman in four years. Now, as
Bukowski became a literary phenomenon in the small/alternative press
world, he became a literary if not literal Don Juan, bedding down his
legions of women fans who flocked to his apartment on DeLongre Avenue
in the sleaziest part of Hollywood. (It was at this time that Bukowski
was friends with a dirty book store manager who was the father of
Leonardo DiCaprio.)"

Linda King is writing a book of that period. It'll be interesting reading.

If you look close enough, everyone has feet of clay. Bukowski's
defenders and proselytisers have a larger burden than usual. However,
Bukowski was a child of troubled times, of that there can be no doubt.
To forgive is the hardest part.

We need a lot of support, us being quite frail
(regardless of what might be held up to the light). I
think I'm reminded of Blanche, from Williams'
Streetcar Named Desire, and, of course, O'Hara's poem,
"Spleen"-- As an aside, and I never really 'loved'
reading B, thought I have appreciated some of his
work, me being more into listening to his raspy voice
and staccato-style storytell of sorts, but he is read
in China--among other places.

Over the past several months I have been using my blog mostly as a quiet
incubator space for a series called "Tenderly" where the work is to
'translate' or 'improv' off Gertrude Stein's "Tender Buttons", the Green
Integer edition, which now looks like an over-squeezed, worn out sponge.

On occasion I also write about reading Stein, Alan Halsey and Jacque Roubaud
to my 90-year old mother poet manque, who offers her own interpretations and
improvisations on the works that I read her, or 'creative writing' exercises
I make up in response to the texts. She does "Cities" in the most recent one
in response to Roubaud's "Streets of Paris." (As I previously suggested the
Roubaud Selected with the Waldrop family translations forthcoming in July
from Dalkey Archive ought to be a big hit - the advance galleys from the
publisher are certainly so with me).

Enjoy,

Small Press Traffic is thrilled to present
JOANNE KYGER,
reading & in celebration of her acceptance of our
Lifetime Achievement Award
plus Book of the Year ceremony
Friday, May 26, 2006 at 7:30 p.m.


Every year the board of directors of Small Press Traffic Literary Arts Center
votes a Lifetime Achievement Award to a living writer of distinction. Past
honorees have included Barbara Guest, Jackson Mac Low, and Carl Rakosi. The
latest recipient of SPT’s Lifetime Achievement Award is Joanne Kyger.


Joanne Kyger made an auspicious debut as the golden girl of the Spicer-Duncan
circle of the late 1950s in San Francisco. Within a month of her arrival
everyone wanted a piece of Kyger, and she became associated with many of the
fluid, mercurial poetry scenes around the “New American Poetry.” Like her best
writing, she was everywhere at once, deep inside the Beat movement, all over
Japan and India, up and down the San Francisco Renaissance, steeped in Charles
Olson’s polis-based soul curriculum, our ambassador to the New York scenes of
Ted Berrigan and Anne Waldman, the mainstay of Bolinas, and a seer in the
Buddhist poetics of the Jack Kerouac School at Naropa University in Boulder.
Those are only the locations; deeper underneath, the substance of her many
lives created, over forty-five years, a new poetic freedom. Based on frank and
sensual observation, an innovating line, a sometimes acerbic wit, and a
devotion to the ‘golden root’ of compassion, Kyger’s poetry continues to win
her the admiration of numerous generations.


Joining us for Kyger’s reading will be her friend, the poet Michael
Rothenberg, who edited As Ever, Kyger’s selected poems, for Penguin Books in
2002. Rothenberg, author of Unhurried Vision, has recently relocated to the
Russian River area and will be on hand to introduce her. We will also show
Kyger’s 1968 video, “Descartes.”


Additionally, we will have an awards ceremony featuring some remarks from the
recipients of our 2005 Book of the Year Awards, including Juliana Spahr and
David Larsen in person, Eileen Tabios for John Yau, Rodney Koeneke for Drew
Gardner, and Magdalena Zurawski for Aaron Kunin.


Note: Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to SPT
members, and CCA faculty, staff, and students.

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in
Timken Lecture Hall
California College of the Arts

the San Francisco State Poetry Center presents



a reading to celebrate the anthology
Every Goodbye Ain't Gone with Aldon NIELSEN,

Lauri RAMEY, William J. HARRIS and giovanni
SINGLETON

Thursday May 25 2006
6:00 pm @ Café Royale

800 Post (at Leavenworth), San Francisco, free

We've been waiting for this one:

Every Goodbye Ain't Gone is a groundbreaking new
anthology of innovative poetry by African
American writers (University of Alabama, 2006),
presenting the work of many of the poets who
carried on the adventurous legacies of Melvin B.
Tolson, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Robert Hayden.
Poetry by such key poets as Melvin Tolson, Amiri
Baraka, Jayne Cortez, Clarence Major, Bob
Kaufman, and June Jordan appears alongside the
work of less familiar poets such as Russell
Atkins, Jodi Braxton, David Henderson, Stephen
Jonas, and Elouise Loftin, poets active from the
1960s and 1970s Black Arts Movement and beyond.

Reading from the anthology:  Aldon Lynn Nielsen,
coeditor, is a poet (Stepping Razor, Vext,
Mixage) and Kelly Professor of American
Literature at Penn State, and the author of
outstanding critical works Black Chant and
Integral Music: Languages of African American
Innovation.  Lauri Ramey, also anthology
coeditor, is Associate Professor of English at
California State U., Los Angeles, and author of
Black British Writing.  William J. Harris
co-authored "Somebody blew off Baraka" with Aldon
Nielsen (African American Review: June 2003),
edited The LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka Reader and
curated a recent exhibition from the life and
works of Amiri Baraka at Brown University.  He is
a poet and Professor of English at The University of Kansas.
giovanni singleton, poet and teacher, edits

Poetry Circle continues in its quest to become a premier site for serious
contemporary and experimental poetry online. There are few sites like it
today, so we encourage you to join and participate.

Poetry Circle is seeking both submissions and editorial help. Although
anyone may submit to the site, roving editors select pieces from works
submitted for inclusion on the Editors' Picks board and for the Selected
Work of the week.

Every year the board of directors of Small Press Traffic Literary Arts C=
enter
votes a Lifetime Achievement Award to a living writer of distinction. Pa=
st
honorees have included Barbara Guest, Jackson Mac Low, and Carl Rakosi. =
The
latest recipient of SPT=92s Lifetime Achievement Award is Joanne Kyger.


Joanne Kyger made an auspicious debut as the golden girl of the Spicer-D=
uncan
circle of the late 1950s in San Francisco. Within a month of her arrival=

everyone wanted a piece of Kyger, and she became associated with many of=
 the
fluid, mercurial poetry scenes around the =93New American Poetry.=94 Lik=
e her best
writing, she was everywhere at once, deep inside the Beat movement, all =
over
Japan and India, up and down the San Francisco Renaissance, steeped in C=
harles
Olson=92s polis-based soul curriculum, our ambassador to the New York sc=
enes of
Ted Berrigan and Anne Waldman, the mainstay of Bolinas, and a seer in th=
e
Buddhist poetics of the Jack Kerouac School at Naropa University in Boul=
der.
Those are only the locations; deeper underneath, the substance of her ma=
ny
lives created, over forty-five years, a new poetic freedom. Based on fra=
nk and
sensual observation, an innovating line, a sometimes acerbic wit, and a
devotion to the =91golden root=92 of compassion, Kyger=92s poetry contin=
ues to win
her the admiration of numerous generations.


Joining us for Kyger=92s reading will be her friend, the poet Michael
Rothenberg, who edited As Ever, Kyger=92s selected poems, for Penguin Bo=
oks in
2002. Rothenberg, author of Unhurried Vision, has recently relocated to =
the
Russian River area and will be on hand to introduce her. We will also sh=
ow
Kyger=92s 1968 video, =93Descartes.=94

  =

Additionally, we will have an awards ceremony featuring some remarks fro=
m the
recipients of our 2005 Book of the Year Awards, including Juliana Spahr =
and
David Larsen in person, Eileen Tabios for John Yau, Rodney Koeneke for D=
rew
Gardner, and Magdalena Zurawski for Aaron Kunin.


Note: Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to S=
PT
members, and CCA faculty, staff, and students.

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in
Timken Lecture Hall

SOCIETY OF AMERICA.

SENIORS by George Stanley. 16 pp ISBN 0-9735337-8-1 @ $8.00.=20
(There's a hidden and perhaps secret fierceness of spirit in the quiet
sardonic wit of these poems, their dismay at the comic helplessness of =
aging
and its conditioned delights, the narrowing horizons of the ordinary, =
and
muted wonder at its flavour. "Words have to come out of the world" puns =
one
of Stanley's flat down-to-earth illusory rejections of the illusory. =
There's
a toughness in the complexity of such ironic comedies, and delicacy in =
their
recurrent thought on words, on poems, on where they come from. There's =
not
one casual utterance in the everydayness of Seniors, but there are =
currents
of strong feeling. One reads, and rereads, and then one reads again.  =

New on Stoning the Devil (www.adamfieled.blogspot.com):

  --"an edifying chat with Frank Sherlock" (w/ Frank's comments)
  this has to do with me retracting my assertion that Ginsberg was a "sell out", & also misconstruing Frank's arguments, which he then clarifies.

  -- "a response to Frank"
  here, I drag out good 'ol Tom Eliot just for the hell of it & rattle many poetic closet-skeletons. Frank's stern comments make an interesting counterpoint.

  as always, much more...

Hi Alex!

Consider first, what we speak of when we say a thing is 'modern' in its
various modern-isms and modern-ities---then the 'post' of the term becomes
more meaningful...or for some, meaningless, though I suspect such a view as
the latter is rather inert.

One thought: maybe Googling, and the Internet and all that is not really
sufficient in the way of research. Books will help, especially when it
comes to
seeing the early use of the word Post-Modern by the Catholic Church over
a hundred years ago.

Not to speak of the use of the term by architects to mean
post-international style, with the use of ornament referring to older styles.

Essentially the term is meaningless in literature, and almost
eaqually meaningless in the other arts--it's simply used to designate
too many things, most of which were already present in the first 30
or so years of the 20th century. Which is probably why you're having
a hard time pinning it down.

i=92m not sure what you want to wring out of this word =
=93postmodernism=94 but don=92t be so postmodern about it: call the =
bluff.=20
it=92s the wreckage of the U.S.S. Kitsch rebuilt with the =
non-functioning parts of Modernism (deserving of its Cap for the bold =
last stand against engulfment by the industrial, alienated, rational =96 =
all of which postmodernism shrugs off as normal wear and tear in =
shopping life).=20

one helpful distinction that Ernst Behler taught was that between =
postmodern theory and phenomena dubbable as =93pomo=94 (say the pomohomo =
[f.n., good example here--the degree to which homophobia stirs up =
objections to this word would indicate the limits of postmodernism and =
the presence of reactionary modernism, which would mediate working =
contradictions in the zeitgeist via binary oppositions and overt =
positionings-----in contrast to postmodern indifference [being =93over =
that,=94 =93over god,=94 =93over poetry=94 and ready to yawn one=92s way =
into a quite life with a hideously polite wife (but who doesn=92t miss =
Derrida=92s love of hearing himself speak?)], who might be defined =
negatively as being unconcerned with the construction of identity as =
gay=97a non-gay gay gay, if that helps).=20

postmodern theory has earned its s p a c e (as much L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E =
poetry will one day) as an artifact of philologically obsessed =
Greco-Eurocentric philosophers with their heads in the sands of history, =
history, with all its limitations, which pulled its sphinx-like =
propheteering out of the books and into the drunken world; and as an =
afterthought of New Critical obsessing with rhetoric. =20

hope this clarifies.

 Not to me it doesn't. What clarifies is getting the word out of my head
and my vocabulary. And I have to say I've been quite successful(I have
had occasion to use post-structuralism when some people want to use
postmodernism as a synonym; and I sometimes have to footnote the usage
that lead to its appearance in the title of Paul Hoover's indispensable
anthology, but that's about it.) A life without postmodernism has much
to recommend it.

i'm not sure what you want to wring out of this word "postmodernism" but
don't be so postmodern about it: call the bluff.=20
it's the wreckage of the U.S.S. Kitsch rebuilt with the non-functioning
parts of Modernism (deserving of its Cap for the bold last stand against
engulfment by the industrial, alienated, rational - all of which
postmodernism shrugs off as normal wear and tear in shopping life).=20

one helpful distinction that Ernst Behler taught was that between
postmodern theory and phenomena dubbable as "pomo" (say the pomohomo
[f.n., good example here--the degree to which homophobia stirs up
objections to this word would indicate the limits of postmodernism and
the presence of reactionary modernism, which would mediate working
contradictions in the zeitgeist via binary oppositions and overt
positionings-----in contrast to postmodern indifference [being "over
that," "over god," "over poetry" and ready to yawn one's way into a
quite life with a hideously polite wife (but who doesn't miss Derrida's
love of hearing himself speak?)], who might be defined negatively as
being unconcerned with the construction of identity as gay-a non-gay gay
gay, if that helps).=20

postmodern theory has earned its s p a c e (as much L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E
poetry will one day) as an artifact of philologically obsessed
Greco-Eurocentric philosophers with their heads in the sands of history,
history, with all its limitations, which pulled its sphinx-like
propheteering out of the books and into the drunken world; and as an
afterthought of New Critical obsessing with rhetoric. =20

hope this clarifies.

Re: all the responses:

1. from Wikipedia: =20

"This article or section is in need of attention from an =
expert<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert> on the subject.
Please help recruit one, or improve this page =
yourself<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3DPostmodernism&action=
=3Dedit> if you can.
Please see discussion =
page<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Postmodernism> for details."

I read the text before I posted the Q; I'm inclined to think the writer =
or writers are as confused as I am on the topic, far too many adjectives =
and adverbs, way far too few nouns and verbs in crisp declarative =
construction.  I came away saying, "Huh?" =20

2.  from the Catholic reference, George, I failed to find one; though in =
truth I did try.  Might you be able to be a bit more specific in your =
directions.  And having used the term over 100 years ago as you say, =
only adds to, not clarifies my confusion. Is tomorrow a new Post Modern =
from yesterday?  Was there ever not a post modern? =20

3. "Essentially the term is meaningless in literature, and almost=20
equally meaningless in the other arts--it's simply used to designate=20
too many things, most of which were already present in the first 30=20
or so years of the 20th century. Which is probably why you're having=20
a hard time pinning it down."

Mark, this may be the most understandable point I've read on the =
subject...the label means so much it is meaningless.  I need to spend =
more time on that thought. =20

4.Dean, Wystan: let me know if you two ever come to any accord on the =
point...sounds to me as though I have two experts with ever divergent =
views.  Perhaps the two of you could collaborate to solve the =
Wikipedia's plea for assistance.  And what could be more meaningful for =
an encyclopediac approach to knowledge than a point and counter-point? =20

5. To all the others....you have pointed me in several directions, for =
that I thank you.  I will read more.  If it matters to any and all, I =
appreciate your thoughts.

This comment comforted me intellectually regarding the Q: what is Post =
Modern?:

"Consider first, what we speak of when we say a thing is 'modern' in its
various modern-isms and modern-ities---then the 'post' of the term =
becomes
more meaningful...or for some, meaningless, though I suspect such a view =
as
the latter is rather inert.

Thank you Nicholas. =20

And thank you too to all the others...I do know a little more than I did =
yesterday, and I've some roads to take for tomorrow.=20

Hey Alex,

The Condition of Postmodernity by David Harvey would be a great place to
start. Read it a decade or so ago. Has a big picture outlook and considers
the larger socio-economic conditions behind the changes in architecture,
art, literature and how technological advancements change our overall
perceptions of time and space.

I'm putting Nada Gordon and my talk, "The Autré," originally given at SPT in
2005, on my blog over the course of the next couple of weekends.

A gloss on explorations and exploitations of "outrageous otherness"
worldwide, and an attempt to situate contemporary English-language poetics
within a global framework, it includes lots of photos, sound clips, and
samples of poetry, comic and visual art.

It's in five parts; the intro and first part are up now at:
http://garysullivan.blogspot.com

Subjects include: Screamin Jay Hawkins, Natacha Atlas, Perez Prado, Beau
Brummel, Rodney Koeneke, Sakura Maku, Tom Hart, Kathy Acker, Suihiro Mauro,
Hijikata Tatsumi, David Larsen, Najwa Karam, Asalah, Michel-Rolph Trouillot,
Dambudzo Marechera, Los Bros Hernandez, Manmohan Desai, Alexei Kruchenykh,
Gu Cheng, Yinka Shonibare, Stacy Doris, V. Shantaram, Adeena Karasick,
Chitra Ganesh, bill bissett, Madison Clell, Ernst Herbeck, Puffy, and many
others.

this is part of my call for the actual text of the law; I cannot believe it
contains no gender-specific information

-----Original Message-----
    Taheri's original article, entitled "A Colour Code for Iran's
'Infidels'", dealt primarily with new legislation that it said was designed
to ensure that Iranians wear "standard Islamic garments" that removed
ethnic and class distinctions and that eliminated "the influence of the
infidel" - presumably meaning the West - "on the way Iranians, especially,
the young dress".

    In fact, however, the legislation contained "absolutely no mention of
religious minorities", according to Hadi Ghaemi, the chief Iran researcher
for Human Rights Watch (HRW), who said it included "only generalities with
regard to promoting a national dress code and fashion industry that should
be subsidised and supported by the government".

    The article - and especially its attribution to "human rights groups" -
was particularly unfortunate, he told IPS, because "it plays into the hands
of the Iranian government that wants to discredit human rights issues that
are raised at the international level". The actual legislation was indeed
"a troubling development", but not for the reasons cited by the Post, he
added, because "its main target is most probably Iranian women".

"Our store is your co-reality" is my misreading of a spam 'subject' line
that just came up on the monitor.
I think it's pretty good description of where Postmodernism art as a
critique takes its root. Andy Warhol's subjects - whether manufactured media
stars or consumer product, as the with the soup cans - are artworks that
occupy, straddle, embrace, enhance, critique and distance themselves from
the ever increasing intensification and presence of the expectations of the
yoke implicit to this  "co-reality".   (subtext = you are what you buy).
Utopia does not manifest as modernist 'sublime', but as a successful,
strategically and aesthetically accomplished defense against getting
entirely consumed by capitalist predators who want to own your buying power
- including your eye balls - lock, stock and barrel. In the post-modernist
approach, you get utopia for about a minute at a time - then its back to
work! Like owning your own "Factory."

When not killing spam, enjoying some real nice sun here!

Subtext continues its monthly series of experimental writing with readings
by
Ethan FUGATE and Daniel COMISKEY at Richard Hugo House on Wednesday, June 7,
2006.  Donations for admission will be taken at the door on the evening of
the
performance.  The reading starts at 7:30pm.

Daniel Comiskey lives and works in Seattle. With Kreg Hasegawa, he edited
Monkey
Puzzle, a magazine of poetry and prose. He was a guest curator for the
Subtext
Reading Series in the fall of 2003, and worked as literary manager for The
Poet's Theater, which produced readings of dramatic works written by poets
including John Ashbery, e.e. cummings, Joyelle McSweeney, and Frank O'Hara.
He
has collaborated with other poets on a number of projects, the most recent
of
which is the long poem Crawlspace, written with C.E. Putnam and forthcoming
as a
chapbook (with bonus CD and 3-D glasses). Translations of Hu Xudong,
produced in
conjunction with Ying Qin, will appear later this year in the Talisman
Anthology
of Contemporary Chinese Poetry.

Ethan Fugate is the author of self published chapbooks "Pneumatics" and "The
Weight of the Sea in a Lazyboy Next Door." His work has recently appeared in
The
Brooklyn Rail, Puppyflowers.com, and poems from the "Lazyboy" series may be
heard on Tangent Radio http://www.thetangentpress.org/radio.htm. Ethan is
the
co-editor of the journal POM2. Ethan lives in Brooklyn with his beagle
Coltrane
and is currently finishing book length version of the "Lazyboy" poems.

ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SNAP MY FINGERS

I know how to
put a song inside
                 your head.

Wide-screen adventure
and obsession with rain.
       This dog is named Lousy.

Five pair dice and moonlight.
Time to suck in your stomach,
                        give your karaoke best.


This dog is named Terminal.


I know a way to implant this song.
Especially since it is a rain song
        with five-part harmony and dogs.

If you put fresh vegetables in that rainy place
everyone would go there-even
               the Tugboat people.

They don't name their dogs.
This dog is Bridge,
                        a little farther.


Experiments With Parallelograms is this dog's Indian name.


Should we even wait for the rain to shine?
For the mad lightning to power
        the new mad science,

or just hit the bar and let Kay Sara,
(the drag queen) sing our blues away.
                Call this pup The Charm.

A piano and some strings-
in the background the cartographer
        meddles with a song about a dog.


The rain shining
has it.

The future Subtext 2006 schedule is:


July 5, 2006   - Stephen Paul Martin (San Diego) & John Olson
August 2, 2006 - Ed Roberson (Pittsburgh) & April DeNonno

Dedicated to Marton Koppany from his friend, Jesse Glass

A man named Marton was walking down the street
A man named Marton was walking down the street,
Down the street walked Marton.

He was not bitter about the road he walked
He was not bitter about the road he walked,
Neither was he bitter in the talk he talked.

He blessed the earth and he blessed the sky
He blessed the earth and he blessed the sky
And as he blessed he had a twinkle in his eye

For he knew the road that he walked upon
Was the self-same road that he talked upon,
The road that he walked was the self-same one.

So here comes Marton and there he goes
Here comes Marton and there he goes,
Where he will stop only Marton knows.

So ok, I know the rules of the Poetics List.  In order to get away with
posting my thanks to Marton for his dedication poem at the latest
Eratio, there has to be some context on the list.  Has there been any
recent discussion of blues as a legit. poetic form?  Of course, the
master of this form is Langston Hughes, but it would be great to find
out about mistresses of this sole indigenous American poetic form as
well, with examples from the latest practitioners, names of anthologies
(if they exist), etc.  Jess

Visuelle Poesie, 1965 - 2005
Collected Visual Poems of
Klaus Peter Dencker
with Introductions by
Karl Young and Franz Mon

Klaus Peter Dencker has been considered Germany's leading visual poet and media theorist for several decades. He is unquestionably that country's most prominent anthologist of the genre. Dencker's work as a poet, anthologist, media critic, producer of documentaries for TV, and archivist of 20th century visual poetry in all modes put him in a unique position. As visual poetry joins web technology, and poetry and its graphic presentation become increasing difficult to keep segregated, Dencker presents alternatives to virtualy all modes while simultaneously including them. If you think you don't like visual poetry, there's a good chance this book will change your mind. If you're an afficionado of any visual poetry modes, this is a must-have volume.

If you're not familiar with Dencker's work, or just plain curious, you can find a complete sequence of poems, Wort Koepfe, Karl Young's introduction to the book, and Dencker's most important essay,  at Dencker's Light and Dust Survey:

Interestingly, several post-modern art theorists have claimed post-modern
art (poetry included of course) is  "an art of dissent" and of
"anti-museumification". The element of dissent is beyond doubt, but much of
that
art (Warhol, the abstract expressionists etc.) have been/is museumified
to a great extent.

Looking beyond borders, in colonial cultures like India, Indonesia, the West
Indies, parts of South Asia, where post-modern art & poetry has picked up an

accent lately, the motto has been "back-to-the-roots", implying sort of a
"backward journey", not in terms of cultural richness, but in time, making
an effort to draw more from native cultural traditions, from the language
rules of the vernacular and lastly, but most importantly, nature.

All this for some, often lead to a natural defiance against "globalization",
while for others, it creates a great conflict between colonist theory and
local practise.

I am not really an expert here, but being multilingual, I can see,
especially in many South Asian languages, the syntax and semantics
of colonial languages have quite dramatically changed vernacular
languages.

Hindi and Bengali, for example, which are two of the six most widely
spoken languages in the world, use a semantic structure today, that is
largely influenced by English. These languages originated from Sanskrit
which had its own rules, a verb-based semantics quite different from
western languages.

I'd love to see an example--a sentence or two in older (but
post-sanskrit) and more recent Bengali, for instance, translated, of
course. The kind of semantic change you describe usually takes a
great deal of time. Some of the Latin dialects that became the
Romance languages, for instance, were almost certainly well on their
way to their modern, less-inflected forms by Cicero's time, well
before foreign influence came into play. Even under the influence of
rule by French-speaking overlords English remained syntactically distinct.

Though it has been no secret to many of our friends and associates,
there has been no announcement. The three founding members of the
Factory School learning and production collective are moving to New York
City this summer to begin a campaign of work, cultural action,
documentation, and knowledge sharing.

Please continue to direct all general queries to info at factory school

Arrived in Rio today.

Not far from my hotel in Ipanema is the Livraria da Travessa, a large book
store. The first books in English I saw were on a table covered with about
15 Bukowski titles.

The problem with my position--'there is no post-modern'--is that it =
implies we,=20
we're all still modern, and it behooves me then to propose a =
discrimination of modernisms,
something like what Murat proposes, although he confuses me. For =
example, when Bernstein refuses irony
he does so, so I presume, to deny being thought of as 'clearly' =
postmodern.=20

Our take as Pavement  Saw Press-- a non-reliant publisher- -


  In the past Jeffrey Lependorf's policies with CLMP have created difficulties for us, as CLMP's best interest has been with national pubilishers who are _not_ small presses, or not interested in minorities either racially or sexually, in fact such publishers as the Kenyon Review, who have few links to Ohio, have been the primary link to a Columbus based literary festival, which has failed as the result of our lack of local support as an outside entity. As I have pinted out to Jeff, this is the equivalent of having the Hudson Quarterly decide the important poets of NYC.

  I really wonder what to expect when one of our national suppliers, Small Press Distribution, is linking forces with a group that cares naught for smaller American publishers and has tried to placate this problem through a frail understanding, which included a  predictable placation of our titles on the basis of race, a hope that by sectioning us off as a an American Indian publisher that CLMP would be able to placate their lack of understanding of midwest publishers, let alone those such as ourselves who have a more than three quarter American indian background that the Kenyon Review and CLMP has chosen to fully ignore.

  As a result of Lependorf's past actions we have chosen not to remain members of CLMP, we have not paid dues, and have _successfully_  urged many other publishers not to agree to be members who are of minority membership. I do not want to create problems with this but our board has decided that CLMP's consistent antics of a white controlled, or at least a anti-non university controlled group consisting primarily of a white constituency, choosing to be against our publishing efforts and the best interests of their focus group and audience, is just something that we do not need to deal with,(at the very least, hands down, 5 to 6 in our board).

  I think his "adoption" by SPD is something unacceptable and we need to talk about this and what measures will be made to control the prejudical nature of Lepordorff's assimiltative practices before we consider considering our tenure with SPD as one of our minor distributors.  I am not sure of your thots on this but our boards feelings  is that Lependorf is an explotative toad who wishes to have publishers such as ourselves join him without conflict so he can exploit our literature on the basis of race. I hate to be a prick but the Am. Indian community in general, thinks he is off base with no valid points, I will do all possible to prevent my collusion with his policies, I wish I knew before the new newsletter as we would have bothered to advertise. Perhaps one of you should call me for the full scoop, and the exacting problem of the situation, 614-445-0534, Dave, be well-- sorry to hear of your choice to attempt a change from us--

  Dear SPD Publisher,

Iâ€™m very happy to tell you about an exciting new development at SPD. We have entered into a partnership agreement with the Council of Literary Magazines & Presses and Literary Venture Network. We believe that combining the resources of SPD, CLMP and the LVF allows us to best serve our shared mission of linking writers and readers through literary publishing.

Through a shared service agreement, Jeffrey Lependorf, who is Executive Director of CLMP and LVF, will also be serving as Executive Director of SPD. He and the staffs of all three organizations will be working to develop efforts that better serve all of our constituents. At the same time, by combining resources, we will be able to maximize our budget potential to serve all of you as effectively as possible.

On behalf of our combined Boards and Staffs, I invite you to contact us with your ideas for maximizing this partnership. We are here to serve you and welcome your thoughts about how we can best strengthen our community to better bring literature to our potential audiences.

Please see the thumbnail sketches below for updates about all three organizations. If you have any questions, please contact me by email at laura@spdbooks.org.

Warm regards,

Laura Moriarty
Deputy Director

I think to understand Charles's post-modernism, one has to focus on his=20
relation to mannerist art, though it might be blasphemous to say it. Languag=
e=20
school in my view, at bottom, is a mannerist movement. What is the idea that=

As to the question of irony -mannerist art does seem to involve an=20
aestheticizing aspect, and Charles believes in bad art (taste). But are thes=
e two things=20
so different? Both involve a foregrounding of style; they are stylistic=20
attributes.

How can one use language as clay without being aware of it?

The meaning of irony in the modern is distance, as in T.S. Eliot, etc,; the=20
mannerist irony is awareness, of its own motions. To be continued.

Something I thought you might find interesting, since you're
discussing the blues and poetry:

"Why I Sing The Blues" is a Canadian anthology of  lyrics and poems
that includes a 13 song CD. It was edited by Jan Zwicky and Brad Cran
(Smoking Lung Press, 2001). It includes some interesting work, by
poets like George Elliot Clarke, Ken Babstock, Lorna "Jean" Crozier etc.

Hundreds of examples could be thrown to illustrate how external catalysts
change a language. It is a fascinating topic. Let me discuss one little
example here -

Most Indian language (Hindi/Bengali/Gujrathi/Oriya/Assamese etc.) words
derived from Sanskrit historically held more than one meaning; in many cases
several. Because of a verb-based semantic structure, each word is derived
from a root-word (verb). The root-word does not have a specific meaning, but
like color in a painting, it has an impression, a flavor, often signifies
an action.

Take for example the word "akshar". This word exists today in many Indian
languages. It means "letter" , sometimes "digit". The word is derived from
the sanskrit root-word "ash" which holds a quality of dynamism. The word
"ashwa" meaning "horse" is derived from the same root word.

A "letter" is used to create a word, words create a sentence, sentences make
a text ...and so on. So at the elementary core of language is a letter, a
nuclear being, which was meant to be dynamic, mobile. We say - "language
flows". That sense was captured by the root-word which was in use in ancient
India thousands of years back. In ancient Indian societies "akshar" meant a
lot of things, like something "mobile", different life-forms etc. It also
meant "letter". What captures motion in nature ? The eye. Hence, the word
"akshi" meaning "eye" was also derived from the same root-word.

Under colonial rule (British), a direct cultural clash resulted between
language traditions and when colonial powers dominate, their language
begins to dominate too. A language that had both verbal power and mysticism
in its womb soon had to be aborted. Specific meanings had to be culled from
each word. Colonial language coerced all major vernacular languages to set
up a word-for-word correspondence to make effective communication made
possible "their" way. In the process, words soon became barren - they were
made to hold a singular meaning. The rest was considered "abscess".

Today, the word "akshar" just means "letter". In fact, it has fewer meaning
and usage than the english word "letter" might have. "Akshi" is an old
fashioned word; for example, it is considered archaic to use this word to
mean 'eye" in an Indian poem today.

Some "Post-modern" Indian poets are thus talking about resuming this
"backward journey" - back to those words that felt like bee-hives, that had
more meaning, more weight, more honey and more buzz. But then, colonial
opression still continues in the language domain - so I'm not sure how
the revival would be made possible.

I think a Tarantino movie starring Ron and Charles as bank robbers might
make a lovely comedy - I guess it would have to be 'post-modern' or maybe
they could pretend they were "modern" or, drawing up plans, argue whether or
not they were one or the other. I'll let anybody's imagination do the rest.

I challenge any poet out there in eyeshot of this post to come up with a
better title for a collection of poems than "Concerto for Bell and
Telephone" (Madeline Gleason, Unicorn Press, 1967).  I really don't think it
can be done.

I came across the book randomly, and am now reading the preface to the
Talisman House Collected Poems edition. I'm surprised I've never heard of
her - she sounds like a fascinating woman.

This is not a syntactic change. And I'm guessing that you're vastly
exaggerating the impact of two centuries (in Bengal--a lot less
elsewhere) of British colonialism on the meanings of words. As in all
other languages, I assume that the cluster of meanings that attaches
to a particular word in Sanskrit-derived languages changes over time,
otherwise "silly" would still mean "innocent." It's not all
loss--some words lose no meanings, and others gain new meanings. And
some words are added, others lost entirely.

In Spanish in the past hundred years or so there's been a
reinvestment by poets in older meanings of words--one aspect of the
neobarroco--which has greatly enriched the textures of their poetry.
They don't blame the changes in the language on this or that hegemon,
tho. I'd guess that in the Indian case doing so is as much a
political as a linguistic statement.

Not long ago I asked Ann Lauterbach for her definition of post modernism.
Her idea was that modernists take as their locus the self, the hub of the
wheel, post modernists others, the spokes of the wheel.

Editors' Statement

Like all MR Performance Journals, the next PJ is an experiment in
content and form. This particular experiment distinguishes itself by
substituting the established thematic approach to the Journal's content
with a multiplicity of current topics and ideas. This particular inquiry
began as a series of questions relating to contemporary dance and its
negotiation with the larger culture. With this in mind, we began to
explore the ways our experimental artistic community and its practices
might intersect with a traditional magazine format. We are interested in
providing a unique forum for increased visibility, critical rigor, and a
multi-disciplinary readership. Writings will be specifically linked to
events, artists, trends, and ideas associated with the '05-'06 season
and well as the upcoming '06-'07 season, in New York as well as
nationally and internationally.

=20

With this in mind, we welcome and encourage submissions that similarly
address the current contemporary field and its highlights, trends, and
ever-changing shape. If interested in proposing an article, interview,
critical essay, profile, or visual/graphic, please submit a brief
paragraph outlining your proposal or intent to write, indicating your
topic and the approximate length of the final article, to the best of
your knowledge and intention.=20

ALL proposals, submissions, and issue-specific inquiries should be
emailed to both of the following addresses by June 15, 2006:

Yes, but you will have to look very very hard to find anything

There was a pretty well known poetry anthology that came out in 1960,
called The New American Poetry, edited by Donald M. Allen.

She was in that.

If Bell were to seek pharmaceutical help for Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder, doubtless you would mean *Concerta* for Marvin
Bell and Cell Phone. (Naturally, I hope said writer does not in fact
have said disorder.)

Sorry George, I wasn't even born then, so there was no way I could have
ordered it through Amazon.

Actually I have that anth in my office but I must have missed Madeline. Or
maybe mistook her for a Kyger.

Woody Allen's "Purple Rose of Cairo" (with its movie character stepping off
screen into "real life") and "Stardust Memories" are certainly as postmodern
as anything in Altman.

One aspect of the "Postmodern Condition" is the loss of the reality
principle, the loss of any clear sense of the real versus the imaginary.
Some examples straight from the papers: water pistol designed to look so
much like actual pistol a kid gets shot dead by a cop; firemen in Los
Angeles wasting several minutes trying to connect their hoses to a fire
hydrant before realizing it's a movie prop not connected to any water
supply; models hired to portray "real people" having a get together inside a
model home during an open house at a new real estate development to help
lure buyers who'd naturally want to live near such hip and attractive
people; a magnificent slight-of-hand act, that fooled the investing world
awhile, called Enron; and the ever more common Columbine to Kyle Huff horror
of desperately unhappy young men taking their video game fantasy shoot em
ups into the real world.

Or consider how, as we progress through time and develop greater stores of
data, the time it takes to go from science fiction to science fact gets
shorter and shorter. Think how long it took from Da Vinci's first drawing of
a helicopter to the creation of an actual working helicopter. Compare that
to the much shorter amount of time from Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon to
the Apollo program, from "If God had intended man to fly, he'd have given us
wings" to the SST. I read that the average lifespan for a scientifically
verifiable "truth" was down to about 25 years (read it so long ago that
we're probably down to 5 or 10 years by now). The TRUTH ain't what it used
to be. There is less and less consensus reality, more and more isolated
personal reality. That is the postmodern condition. It's probably more
useful to talk about the way a particular work responds to the condition of
postmodernity than whether a work is or is not itself postmodern.

First, I think it is simply not the case that there is any greater
loss of a clear sense of the real versus the imaginary now in the
West than at any other time in human history. When someone is hit by
a car or bit by a dog they do not call on God instead of going to the
hospital (in addition, certainly, but not instead). When they're
hungry, they eat food, not wax imitations -- not after the first
bite.

People can be fooled; other people try to fool them, for fun or
profit. But that has been the case for all of human history, and it
is false, and I think a peculiar falsity of the ivory tower outlook,
to claim that this is "postmodern". Perhaps ivory tower dwellers have
only just noticed that people are gullible and venal and in their
shock and dismay have decided to call it "postmodern"?

Even if there were a loss of a clear sense of the real versus the
imaginary, these are _terrible_ examples of such a thing. These are
all examples of one set of people trying to fool another set, not
examples of areas of the world where gravity doesn't work any more
for a bit and then does again, or where medicines work and don't work
depending on some imponderable, or that some gods have started really
intervening in the real world in response to some kinds of prayer, or
just for sport, or that pollutants have triggered chemicals in the
human brain that prevent us from perceiving the difference between
hallucinations and reality, or other such real losses of "the real
versus the imaginary". Your examples are all trivially irrelevant to
your claim.

There is not less consensus reality -- there is less consensus social
agreement. People constuct, in the midst of a hugely wealthy society,
very different sets of social mores. Their energies are expended in
attempts to form personally meaningful social groups because they no
longer have to expend those energies just to stay alive and try to
explain the world around them. The world around them is adequately
explained, and they accept the general explanations, and seek out
personally meaningful sub-explanations. Many of those sub-
explanations are not congruent with reality because people are
perverse, and dumb, and ill-educated, and gullible, and venal, and an
enormous range of other things -- but when they are hit by a car or
bit by a dog they do not rely on their incongruent sub-explanations,
they go to the hospital, for example.

There is no "condition of postmodernity" as you've described it.
Whether there is such a condition or not is still up for debate, I
suppose, but your description is no different than a description of
any other time's human societies. There have always been people who
are gullible or venal, always people ill- and well-educated, have
always been local, regional, and world celebrities in whose names the
venal and the gullible meet. Saints' relics are, in fact, probably a
much better example of your description of "postmodern" than
imitation fire hydrants and guns. Perhaps you just have the wrong
era.

i'm not sure i consider this a productive discussion, but let me just
leap in to paraphrase the allen/altman thing:  with allen, we always
know where the center of gravity is; it's in the allen character, if
there is one, or in the main character's moral dilemmas in the
serious pieces.  allen is very dostoyevskian, though at times he has
kafkaesque aspirations, but those ones never quite seem to get off
the ground.  with altman, you really can't always determine a center.
it's that simple.

Thank you, Aryanil, for your examples.

I, like Mark Weiss, though, am unpersuaded. We speak of connotation
and denotation in English words, and it seems to me you're speaking
of some similar notions in HIndi/Bengali/Gujrathi/Oriya/Assamese etc.
It sounds as if 'akshar' has a number of connotations in addition to
its denotative meanings in context. I think it's the context that
guides the audience to understand which of the various things a word
can mean is meant by its use in a given example. In English there are
lots of words for "horse", for example. A nag is a sort of ill-used
or over-used horse; a steed is a sort of magnificent horse. So to say
"The knight rode up on his nag" or "The beggar arrived on his steed"
is to play significantly between denotative and connotative meanings.
These sentences can really only be understood in an even larger
context, the whole of the anecdote, or the tone of the tale, or the
situation in which the story is being told, for example.

What you're describing are the problems of translation exacerbated by
the demands of bureaucracy, I think. Bureaucrats of any society are
intolerant of ambiguity. The point of bureaucracy may be fairly said,
I think, to try to reduce ambiguity as much as possible. Even within
a single language-culture the clash between bureaucrat and poet
regarding the use of language is profound. Certainly a foreign
occupying bureaucrat may be somewhat less tolerant of some kinds of
common social ambiguities than a same-culture bureaucrat, but in most
cultures most people are facile in understanding the various uses of
language. One doesn't go to the bureaucrat with poems, or to the poet
with forms to be filled out.

Allen was self-consciously using a common trope of silent films (most
famously in Buster Keaton, but it was already old when he got to it).

You want "postmodern" confusion of reality and fiction? Check out
Georges Melies, who made films from about 1900 to 1913.

A great imp[act of film was precisely the confusion of reality and
fiction. Famously, the first closeup, appended to The Great Train
Robbery, caused theaters to dissolve into panic--a bad guy raising
his pistol and firing towards the audience.

Marcus & Mark

I think I have failed to explain myself. Or there is some resistance
to accepting my stance that colonialization has often negatively
impacted vernacular languages.

I didn't attempt to refer to connotations. I am refering to single words
that house many meanings. Distinctive meaning, not connotation. Of course
the usage determines which of these many meanings are intended. Sometimes
the same sentence, if used craftily, could mean more than one thing - shades
of meaning that could be sometimes close but not necessarily always.

Take for example, English words like "row" or "swallow" which could be used
to mean several things. The bird "swallow", the gobble "swallow", the
mumbling "swallow" etc. Now, imagine we begin to use the word "swallow"
to mean just the bird. The word soon gets stripped off its other meanings.
Its other usages. Don't you think that impoverishes the language ? Likewise,
as you try to see beyond the word, you'll soon notice, that certain "modes
of writing" start falling off the language while certain other modes begin
to dominate.

Its not a bureaucratic issue, neither is it an issue with translatability.
It is about colonial influence and I don't think that has happened in India
alone. I'm only trying to describe the effect on Indian languages.

Your example of "horse" is not exactly a fitting parallel of what I'm trying
to describe.

Here are a few other examples that might be able to prove how colonial
cultural exposure changes the "modes" of vernacular writing.

1. The "novel" form or the modern day narrative, did not exist in ancient
Indian texts. Poetic forms were more prevalent. When British East India
Company began to expand territorial rule, they realized they need the
natives to participate in local administration. The structure of the society
soon began to change around these "jobs". The so-called "babu" middle-class
evolved, they began to learn English. The natives of Calcutta (now Kolkata)
and Madras (now Chennai) responded promptly. A nouveau, bilingual Indian
middle-class intelligentsia evolved. Bankim Chandra Chatterjee,
a Bengali author, wrote, what is called the first Indian "novel" in early
nineteenth century during the Bengal Renaissance. It is no secret that
there was a strong influence of Sir Walter Scott on his work. A shift soon
began, written language gradually moved away from the poetic forms to a more
prosaic structure. The syntactical transformations in the language, that I
have mentioned before, started to be become more apparent.

2. Forget British influence for a few minutes. English, in India at least,
over the last two decades is an American language. The American idiom is all
over the place. I am not arguing that is "bad influence". But at times the
influence is very pleasant.

Lets take the word "skyscraper". A quarter century back, when I was in
high-school, we used a Bengali word to mean "skyscraper". That word, if
directly translated back into english would sound "sky-toucher". That word
is rarely used these days. An exact Bengali translation of "skyscraper" is
in place.

If you ask me, "scraping the sky" appears to be a little less contrived than
"touching the sky", which hints at a lot more than "scraping". "Touching" is
a more genteel action than "scraping" anyway.

3. There is a word in Hindi (also used in Bengali occassionally) for
man/person - Admi. A man-eater tiger is called "Adamkhor". There were
many other sanskrit derived (tatsama) words that were/are used to mean
a "man" or a "person". A pretty popular word was (which is still used
in Bengali/Hindi spheres) "lok". The word "lok" has the following meanings -
a)  person   b) man   c) space   d) area   e) community
However, with the advent of the British, the word "Admi" became a more
frequent substitute to mean "man" or "person". It does not carry any other
meaning or connotation. The word "Admi", is a phonetic aberration of "Adam".


Societies change with the passage of time, rivers shrink or widen, cells
mutate transitively, animals adapt and no wonder language changes too, some
die (like sanskrit) while others are born (ebonics/esperanto/jharkhandi).
We all know that.

I was trying to show you how colonial influence changes a language, at times
by hollowing out rich overflowing canals and discarding them as "abscess".

Modernism = Colonialism (inclusivism)= control from the Center
Postmodern = Emigrant (pluralism/diaspora) = no central control

where ever you are there is central control:
the police
the leading economic interests

(whether local or globalized corporate ones)

to move from one place to another is to exchange these; one place may be
less repressive than another, --still,  everywhere these are control systems
at the center of daily life

"almost every desire of a poor person is a criminal offense"

I recommend a recent book by Thomas McEvilley, who has recently become
the chair of the School of Visual Art's program in critical writing:

*The Triumph of Anti-Art: Conceptual & Performance Art in the Formation
of Post-Modernism* Documentext: McPherson & Company, New York, 2005.

Also, Aryanil's etymologies are all popular but false etymologies [call
them folk etymologies].

1. akshara = 'unending' > 'syllable' > 'letter'.  It is an early name of
the sacred syllable OM.  It has nothing to do with
2. ashva = 'horse' cognate with Lat. 'equus', Greek 'hippos', etc.  It
has nothing to do with
3. akshi = 'eye', cognate with Lat. 'oculis', Greek 'ossa', German
'Auge', Eng. 'eye'.

Aryanil's etymologies are 'postmodern' insofar as they are word-play,
and maybe also insofar as they have no historical basis.

Anyway, McEvilley is an advocate for post modernism.  Might as well get
a definition from an advocate.

Best wishes,

George Thompson [Sanskritist]

I can refer to several scholarly articles by P.C.Sen, Kalim Khan, Sukumar
Sen et al, if you could read them in Bengali.

"akshara", "akshi" "ashva" are all derived from "ash" dhaatu.

*Dear Aryanil,

I can refer to several etymological dictionaries of Old Indo-Aryan in
German and French, as well as dictionaries of Proto-Indo-European in
German, French, Russian, Italian and English, if you could read them.

What you have in these Bengali sources is an old folk etymology.  If you
are serious about looking into this, check out this article, an old classic:

"The etymologies in the ancient Indian Brahmanas" by Jan Gonda, in
*Lingua* 5, 1955.

You should stick with the poetics.  Avoid the etymologies.

George

would be interesting to compare it to the Gene Kally scene in "Singin in the=

Rain," one of the precursor films of post-modern cinema, silence, the eye, a=

soulfully moves and Tom Waits and Krystal Gale sing.

When Charles uses same word -as verb and adverb- in the same line, and he=20
repeats the gesture all the way through, he is creating a post-modern poem.

One sees almost never such awareness in Scorcese. If he uses "outside"=20

His decision to ignore the trivia materials of daily life (newspaper=20

one's back tingle, itch and burn, as if being bitten

clean place, free of all the donkey shit, rubbish,
spiders half the size of a hand, into what is a clean
cottage, communal, where monks are living. I will
start worked at the monestary on Monday. The writing
is going well and have organized some cooperative

tomorrow evening. For those of who are Americans, it
is this idea of individualism, the considerate basis
of liberty, and the fate of all those injuns who are

to stand up, push aside all that fascade, and stop:
"doing little more then staking out and defending
one's insular existence."

I agree, Maria, that Altman, with his 'lack of center' ensemble casts and
multiple plot lines, is overall more postmodern than Allen and was only
suggesting that there are postmodern moments in Allen as well. Problem, of
course, is that a work can be "postmodern" in many different ways because
postmodern has been defined so broadly and vaguely that it's not especially
useful. Also agree that this is likely not a productive discussion......

Thanks Mark. Have read some about Melies but haven't seen any of his work
yet. The Purple Rose of Cairo is "postmodern" in the way that Robert
Coover's stories, in which cartoon characters share the same world as "real"
fictional people, are. But, as you point out, that trope (like so much
labeled "postmodern") dates well back into the "modernist" period.

Please disseminate to Raza interested in the question of Education
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bulletin/Announcement
May 2006

In Unity There Is Strength
Join The Association of Raza Educators (ARE)

Consider the following:
1. Bilingual Education has been virtually destroyed. It fact, it was never given a chance to succeed.
2. Raza Studies and Multicultural Studies, in the great majority of the schools, no longer exist.  Educators who favor a multiculturalist, working class based education, are under constant attack.
3. Critical Pedagogy is a thing of the past, and most teachers, as well as administrators, don't even know what it is.
4. The English Only movement is getting stronger.  Educators are told not to speak Spanish to students.  Speaking Spanish will soon be a crime.
5. Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) is being eliminated, specially where Mexican-Latino and African American students are in the majority.
6. Academic Freedom is a thing of the past. Most teachers are scared to speak out.  Teachers are being forced to use materials, limit their curriculum to a particular area of study, and utilize methods of instruction created (and promoted) by people who do not have the well being of our students in mind.
7. School administrators have rejected a space for alternative or creative methods of teaching and are demanding that educators teach to the test, or instruct in robotic, same shoe fits ALL approach.
8. Administrators are now dictators not educators, or have become enforcers and thugs for the racist-fascist boards of education or of the federal government.

Questions for us:
1. What are we going to do when we attempt to include multicultural and critical pedagogy into our curriculum and are told by the administration not to do so?
2. Are we going to enforce the English Only laws or turn in our students who don't have documents to the Border Patrol?  Our we going to be accomplices in the denying of education to children?
3. What are we going to do when our school administrators start harassing or move to fire us for refusing to betray our students, or when we teach in a fashion or use content that we feel (as professionals and Raza) would most benefit our students?
4. What should be more important to us, the education of our students, our dignity as a people, or our jobs?

Answer:
1. The truth is that no progressive change ever come about without struggle. Educators must unite and struggle for what is right.
2. History has proven, that in numbers and in unity there is strength. If you want to protect yourself against harassment and reprisals, you must unite with other educators who share the same ideas or objectives as you.
3. Simply complaining or living in fear, or denying the realities around us, are not virtues of an educator.  Our profession demands that we do something concrete about problems affecting our students and our communities.

/"This activity led the CIA to establish proprietary companies, fronts,
and covers for its domestic operations. So widespread did they become
that President Johnson allowed the then CIA Director, John McCone, to
create in 1964 a new super-secret branch called the Domestic Operations
Division (DOD), the very title of which mocked the explicit intent of
Congress to prohibit CIA operations inside the U.S. This disdain for
Congress permeated the upper echelons of the CIA. Congress could not
hinder or regulate something it did not know about, and neither the
President nor the Director of the CIA was about to tell them. Neither
was J. Edgar Hoover, even though he was generally aware that the CIA was
moving in on what was supposed to be exclusive FBI turf." / Domestic
Surveillance: The History of Operation CHAOS by Verne Lyon Covert Action
Information Bulletin, Summer 1990

Most of us are familiar with the FBI's infamous Counter Intelligence
Program known as COINTELPRO that was a major component of the illegal
activities and egregious abuses during the 1960's and beyond. What many
are not aware of is the fact the US government has engaged in domestic
surveillance, spying, disruption, repression and murder since day one.
Their first targets were dissident whites, Native Americans and Africans
during the nation's infancy. As the nation grew the ruling elites feared
the masses might one day wake up to what they were doing to them, so
they kept a tight reign on them and monitored them lest threats to their
predatory and exploitative capitalist system crop up. The key to success
for the ruling elites was cheap labor. To secure it, they first
attempted to enslave the Native American population while at the same
time clearing and expropriating their lands. The Europeans' attempts to
enslave the so called "Indians" failed miserably so they turned to
importing whites to serve as indentured servants and when that did not
work out well, to importing kidnaped Africans. They kept the Africans
under constant surveillance and formulated extensive slave codes and spy
networks to prevent insurrections, uprisings and mass escapes.
Following the Civil War, the US elites recruited more Europeans to
immigrate into this country to counterbalance the growing population of
Africans in AmeriKKKa and help with the imperialist expansion into the
West. It was only natural the whites who came would chafe at their
working conditions, lowly status and they attempted to organize to
challenge the exploitation they experienced. This lead to serious and
often violent confrontations. The owners and their managers were pitted
against the laborers. The capitalists called on the government (police,
militia and courts) and they intervened on the side of the owners. By
the late 1800's labor strife was the norm and the state forces almost
always sided with owner class in numerous violent confrontations. The
federal and local governments kept an eye on what their propagandists
called "radicals and anarchists" and waged out and out war on labor
organizers (mine and railroad workers).

Coming into the early twentieth century the federal government spied on
blacks, the fledgling labor movement and the new radicals called
"communists". WWI ushered in repression and spying under the aegis of
"national security" (the Palmer Raids), by WWII John Edgar Hoover and
the military were in full stride; spying on AmeriKKKans with impunity.
Following WWII with the creation of the CIA things started to get really
out of hand. "For over fifteen years, the CIA, with assistance from
numerous government agencies, conducted a massive illegal domestic
covert operation called Operation CHAOS. It was one of the largest and
most pervasive domestic surveillance programs in the history of this
country. Throughout the duration of CHAOS, the CIA spied on thousands of
U.S. citizens. The CIA went to great lengths to conceal this operation
from the public while every president from Eisenhower to Nixon exploited
CHAOS for his own political ends... During the life of Operation CHAOS,
the CIA had compiled personality files on over 13,000 individuals
including more than 7,000 U.S. citizens as well as files on over 1,000
domestic groups. The CIA had shared information on more than 300,000
persons with different law enforcement agencies including the DIA and
FBI. It had spied on, burglarized, intimidated, misinformed, lied to,
deceived, and carried out criminal acts against thousands of citizens of
the United States. It had placed itself above the law, above the
Constitution, and in contempt of international diplomacy and the United
States Congress. It had violated its charter and had contributed either
directly or indirectly to the resignation of a President of the United
States. It had tainted itself beyond hope. " Domestic Surveillance: The
History of Operation CHAOS by Verne Lyon
http://www.serendipity.li/cia/lyon.html.

Keep in mind the legislation that created the CIA forbade domestic
activity oagainst US citizens. But this did not stop the good ol' boy
network from engaging in illegal activities along with their
counterparts in the FBI, DIA, NSA and a host of other alphabet agencies.
"We have seen segments of our Government, in their attitudes and action,
adopt tactics unworthy of a democracy, and occasionally reminiscent of
the tactics of totalitarian regimes. We have seen a consistent pattern
in which programs initiated with limited goals, such as preventing
criminal violence or identifying foreign spies, were expanded to what
witnesses characterized as 'vacuum cleaners', sweeping in information
about lawful activities of American citizens. The tendency of
intelligence activities to expand beyond their initial scope is a theme
which runs through every aspect of our investigative findings.
Intelligence collection programs naturally generate ever-increasing
demands for new data. And once intelligence has been collected, there
are strong pressures to use it against the target. The pattern of
intelligence agencies expanding the scope of their activities was well
described by one witness, who in 1970 had coordinated an effort by most
of the intelligence community to obtain authority to undertake more
illegal domestic activity... Too many people have been spied upon by too
many Government agencies and to much information has been collected.

The Government has often undertaken the secret surveillance of citizens on
the basis of their political beliefs, even when those beliefs posed no
threat of violence or illegal acts on behalf of a hostile foreign power.
The Government, operating primarily through secret informants, but also
using other intrusive techniques such as wiretaps, microphone "bugs"
surreptitious mail opening, and break-ins, has swept in vast amounts of
information about the personal lives, views, and associations of
American citizens. Investigations of groups deemed potentially dangerous
-- and even of groups suspected of associating with potentially
dangerous organizations -- have continued for decades, despite the fact
that those groups did not engage in unlawful activity. Groups and
individuals have been harassed and disrupted because of their political
views and their lifestyles. Investigations have been based upon vague
standards whose breadth made excessive collection inevitable. Unsavory
and vicious tactics have been employed -- including anonymous attempts
to break up marriages, disrupt meetings, ostracize persons from their
professions, and provoke target groups into rivalries that might result
in deaths. Intelligence agencies have served the political and personal
objectives of presidents and other high officials. While the agencies
often committed excesses in response to pressure from high officials in
the Executive branch and Congress, they also occasionally initiated
improper activities and then concealed them from officials whom they had
a duty to inform. Governmental officials -- including those whose
principal duty is to enforce the law --have violated or ignored the law
over long periods of time and have advocated and defended their right to
break the law."- INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES AND THE RIGHTS OF AMERICANS
BOOK II FINAL REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL
OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES UNITED STATES SENATE
TOGETHER WITH ADDITIONAL, SUPPLEMENTAL, AND SEPARATE VIEWS APRIL 26
(legislative day, April 14), 1976.
This report, The Church Committee Report was filed in 1976, a little
over thirty years ago; alas it's just as timely and factual today, even
more so than in 1976! George W.Bu$h is no different than his father,
Clinton, Reagan, Nixon, Johnson, Kennedy or Eisenhower. The executive
branch abusing its' power is nothing new. Bu$h has merely expanded these
abuses and declared himself "the decider" on issues of spying on
AmeriKKKans. The problem is, the citizens have no one in their corner.
The CIA's Operation Mockingbird and media deregulation are colossal
successes having totally undermined the whole notion of a free press and
tuned it into a mind control apparatus that would make the CIA's MK
Ultra program blush. Now the ruling elites are attempting to take over
the Internet because they realize it is the last bastion of unfiltered
information. So with the unprecedented expansion of the executive
branch, the control of all information, total surveillance of the
population, the enlargement of the AmeriKKKan gulag, AmeriKKKa has
finally morphed into a totalitarian police state Hitler and Stalin would
envy. The irony of all this is, the US Congress is more upset and
concerned about the recent FBI raid on the offices of one of their own
than the wholesale constitutional abuses, invasions of privacy or spying
on millions of AmeriKKKans!

I was thinking of My Large Buffpo Wedding, where Ron & Charles make it
up the aisle at last, pursued by the hordes of Buffpo, the parents
still arguing with the wedding organiser, the pomo cake wobbling as it
decided what each of the guests wanted it to be. The, uh, lovely
couple have a simple cermony borrowing bits from all religions, and
atheism. The guests from England will stand in a corner amongst
cat-pee and shadows saying "it'll never work", and "you don't want to
do it like that". Afterwards, there'll be a fight between the East
coast and West coast relatives whilst the rest of us get pissed etc
etc. And we all go aahh

Of course Marcus & Mark don't see the negative effects - they've never
been on the receiving end of any empire's droit de seigneur so how
could they even begin to understand? Their language hasn't been
defiled, words ursurped, accents imitated condescendingly, jokingly
put down, books changed, destroyed all in the name of some higher
good, some better this with a force that cannot be denied  ...

 if that were the case, Thoreau, Emerson, Whitman, Hawthorne, et al
would all be modernists, which doesn't seem to help much aside from
 reinforcing the suspicion that the problems with the term post-modern
can often be sheeted home to problems with the term modern.

Not long ago I asked Ann Lauterbach for her definition of post
modernism. Her idea was that modernists take as their locus the self,
the hub of the wheel, post modernists others, the spokes of the wheel.

I am a little puzzled by those who would deny that there is a thing that
can be rightly called post modernism.

I think that the recent witty banter about Bernstein & Silliman, or
Woody Allen & Altman, presumes that there is in fact a significant
difference here, and for people like Alex Saliby who want to get a
handle on these terms, these denials don't seem helpful.

Of course, I agree with Mark Weiss & others who have suggested that the
term post modernism is too broad and over-used.  But, though I am a
Sanskritist with my head buried in remote Vedic antiquity, I happen to
be surrounded by artists in my family, and I have for some strange
reason been teaching at an art school for the past dozen years or so.
As such, I have no doubt that there is a post modernism that we should
acknowledge, as such.

I am convinced that most of us have come to have certain reservations
about modernism.  To the extent that we do, we are all post modern.  I
think that all of us who are feminists are post modern.  I think that
all of us who identify ourselves as ethnic are post modern.  I think
that all of us who identify ourselves as gay are post modern.  I think
that all of us who are drawn to non-European arts & cultures are post
modern as well.  Actually, I think that all of us are post modern,
whether we know it or not.

I mentioned McEvilley earlier.  He was involved in a famous debate in
the 80's concerning a well-known show at MOMA, "Primitivism" in
Twentieth Century Art: Affinity of the Tribal and the Modern. Many of
you are familiar with this, I'm sure.  He was an editor at Artforum at
the time, and he was one of the people who led the charge against MOMA
modernism.  I use the exchange between him and the curators of the MOMA
show to introduce students to post modernism.

My students almost totally self-identify as post modernist in response
to this debate between McEvilley and the curators of this show,
well-known and influential people like William Rubin and Kirk Varnedoe,
guardians of the modernist church of art., both now dead

And then we turn to film history.  Even the slowest students recognize
that when we turn to recent films we have entered into a landscape that
is no longer modernist.

One example:  Chris Nolan's "Memento." They love it.  Their parents hate it.

 I'll  have to take  your word for it that something started and stopped
with 9/11. But you know New York and the US aren't the centre of
all things. A few years before-- we don't fetishise the day and the
month-- French terroritsts blew up the Rainbow Warrior a few blocks from
where
I sit, in an outrage in my country roughly comparable with your 9/11.
You don't catch me going around saying modernism ended with the Rainbow
Warrior.
Maybe living in a small country gives one a greater sense of proportion.

Of course Marcus & Mark don't see the negative effects - they've never
been on the receiving end of any empire's droit de seigneur so how could
they even begin to understand? Their language hasn't been defiled, words
ursurped, accents imitated condescendingly, jokingly put down, books
changed, destroyed all in the name of some higher good, some better this
with a force that cannot be denied  ...

9/11 is when pomo *really started and modernism ended. Denial is
everywhere and the prophets are now in the wilderness

With regard to Charles Olson's use of the term postmodern, what he meant by
it as opposed by what it has come to mean in critical theory, Ralph Maud
has an essay, possibly of interest to the discussion here.

"Adamkhor" is originally Persian. Another, a prior, outside influence.

  can be rightly called post modernism.

  I think that the recent witty banter about Bernstein & Silliman, or=20
  Woody Allen & Altman, presumes that there is in fact a significant=20

  Of course, I agree with Mark Weiss & others who have suggested that =
the=20
  term post modernism is too broad and over-used.  But, though I am a=20
  Sanskritist with my head buried in remote Vedic antiquity, I happen to =

  be surrounded by artists in my family, and I have for some strange=20
  reason been teaching at an art school for the past dozen years or so.  =

  As such, I have no doubt that there is a post modernism that we should =

I'm happy to agree that colonialism changes vernacular languages
significantly. But what languages do is change. Who was it who said
that a language is a dialect with an army and navy? The conquerors
have their view of the world, and they expect to enforce it -- or
they wouldn't be conquerors. That's what conquerors _do_, after all:
enforce their view of the world. Welsh and other Gaelic languages are
just barely ticking over any more (Bales is Welsh), in spite of the
fact that it was the _Welsh_ longbow that enabled the English to go
out conquering. But the Gaels have had kings and prime ministers and
dominant literary people within the British political structure. So
with the Greeks and Romans.

Various dialects-with-armies on the Indian continent had their own
colonialist conquering days, as well, and imposed their language on
the unwilling no less than they subsequently resisted other
conquerors' languages before English came along. Every age is as hard
a place to save your soul as every other age. Ours is not the worst.
Eymology is the history of political imposition -- and resistance.

The examples you gave, George Thompson's scholarship aside (no
offense, just to the side for a moment, not to say it's not usefully
impressive), though, together with the notion that "some 'post-
modern' Indian poets are talking about resuming the 'backward
journey'," doesn't strike me as particularly new, or even
interesting, even if your etymologies were not as questionable as
George has shown. A clever translator can do a lot of good for
himself and his family, tribe, etc. through careful editing -- and a
lot of harm to his enemies, including the occupiers, if he chooses. I
have no doubt there were a large number of such clever translators
who were careful to maneuver in and out of the various meanings of a
large number of words. I'm not very familiar, alas, with the process
in India, but the stories are rife in Graeco-Roman and European
tales, and any of us who've ever been in the position of translating,
even casually, can think of our own examples.

It's not that I have no sympathy for the demands that the
colonialists place on the language of the colonized, it's that it's a
common tale, often told, and not very interesting, nor significant,
in and of itself. More power to the contemporary Indian poets who are
examining their languages! But post-modern? Nah.

Ireland too, liberated from the British regime the same time
India did. It would be interesting to know what effect
colonialization left on their language and literature.

I am indeed aware that language changes, else it would be
dead, or marginalized, like Sanskrit, for example, and I
did mention it in my correspondence. In fact, what got
me interested in "words, their meanings and their environ"
is a new series of poems I am working on which are based on
word-thoughts.

While I am researching the "lost abscesses" of a given word,
I'm also trying to explore the newness they have acquired over
time, a newness I could offer through my poem and sometimes I am
inspecting it as a psychological pill, trying to think of the cloud of
thoughts
it creates as you inject it into the mind. Looking for the chilly in the
curry that can't be found with a magnifying glass.

I was deeply shocked by Thompson's grossly impolite dismissals. I have no
inclination to talk about it here, in this e-mail. I'll write directly to
him.

Well, I don't  find it interesting either. I stated it as a fact. Also,
that is only one of the many complex thinks they have dealt with.
Some of my poems, that have been included in post-modern Bangla
and Hindi anthologies have left me wondering for ever as to "what is so
post-modern
about these specific poems".

A translated english language collection "PostModern Bangla Poetry -
2001" has come out too. The introduction by ex-Hungryalist poet
Malay Roy Choudhury (who was published in the 60s by City Lights)
is fascinating. If anyone is interested to review it in a journal, I can
send it out.

I disagree -- in fact, I think this is just the kind of point-missing
approach that characterizes most claims of "post-modern". In our day,
"hit by a car" signifies the random chance of disaster. In other
days, one could certainly get "hit by a car", metaphorically, but it
was more likely to be a disease or one of those clowns in a chariot
in whose way some poor commoner mischanced to stand.

This seems to be arguing against yourself. The examples you gave
previously are just not examples of ways people act being changed in
any way.

Mistaking the imaginary for the real cannot reasonably be held to be
evidence of the "post-modern" because the very notion of the stage,
of literature, of art itself, is a mistaking of the imaginary for the
real -- to significant and cathartic effect, effects intended to
evoke and convey real emotions in real people. The idea that such a
thing is "post-modern" is ridiculous, unless you define the "modern"
as pre-antiquity, and declare that humanity has been "post-modern"
for ten thousand years -- which, I suppose, I shouldn't put past
"post-modern" theorists.

Literature and history are filled with incidents of people taking the
real to be imaginary and the imaginary to be real. Oedipus killed his
real father, imagining him to be a stranger. Atilla the Hun stopped
plundering Italy after a parley with Leo X -- what Atilla imagined,
and what Leo said was real, we'll never know, but what Leo knew, and
what we know, is that if Atilla had ignored it, there was nothing to
stop the Huns in the rest of the peninsula. No one stood around
saying it was "post-modern", either -- though many people called it a
miracle. Someone referred to
http://www.charlesolson.ca/files/archaic1.htm, where I found this
quote:

"The formula seems inescapable," says Butterick; "the deeper man
returns to his archaic, primordial, pre-rationalist condition, the
further beyond modernism he advances"

Perhaps what "post-modern" really means, then, is "pre-modern", and
it's all just anti-intellectual hogwash. One wonders what post-
modernists do when they've got appendicitis. We can only hope they'll
return to their archair, primordial, pre-rationalist conditions, I
suppose, and there'll be a spate of them winning the Darwin Awards.

Bah -- anyone who's ever had the misfortune to spend any committed
time with the schizophrenic or other seriously dissociative diseases
will easily see this for the crap it is. Those whose conditions are
REALLY about "loss of the reality principle" or "loss of any clear
sense of the real versus the imaginary" are very different from
either ordinary people or intellectuals who talk about "loss of the
reality principle" or "transgressive art" and the like. What people
who really do experience the loss of the reality principle believe is
PRECISELY that the laws of nature no longer function.

Someone else wrote:

This kind of utterance reveals that you probably really do think that
the lies about WMDs are the very first lies any government has ever
presented to its constituencies as a justification for war. Don't you
get it? It's all been evasions and half-truths, and always has been.
It's not "post-modern" to talk about lying governments, for god's
sake!

Someone else wrote:

Well, explain what your claim IS, then. Maybe they ARE good examples
of whatever else it is you're claiming, but they're not good examples
that we live in a time when the human condition has changed in any
significant way.

Someone else wrote:

I'll tell you what: you refrain from fumbling after pathetic insults
like this one, and I'll refrain from pretending that you're so ill-
educated you think Gibbon is a species of monkey, okay? Can't we talk
about this without the Gudding Effect trailing us all about like the
bad stink it is?

People have died pretending to have weapons they didn't have since
before there were water pistols. People have dug false wells, lied
about real estate values, lied as merchants, and been inspired to go
kill people by art and artifice forever. Homer's poems were the video
games of his day, dude. Have you ever read them? Spears going through
teeth, which scatter like Chiclets, and the spurt of blood as the
head goes through the roof of the mouth and into the brain? And what
about those long lists of ships and shields, eh? Is that advertising,
is that product-placement, or what?

That's right -- it's all the same. People lie. People cheat. People
steal. People love, laugh, and die. The means are not as relevant as
you'd have them be.

Mistaking hyperbole for an actual claim. How low is that?

Dear Marcus and Aryanil,

Please let me interrupt your interesting discussion just one more time,
and then I'll  drop out.  First, I will apologize to Aryanil if I have
been impolite.  Nevertheless, the Sanskrit 'etymologies' that you have
cited have a long history, going back to the Vedic texts themselves.
But in these texts these 'etymologies' are better understood as word-play.

Etymologies are different from word-play insofar as there is a serious
effort to get right the actual historical development of the words
[Greek 'etymos' = true, actual, real].  Word-play feels no obligation to
etymos.

What undercuts the word-play as etymology in many Indic languages [not
just Bengali] with a word like ashva 'horse' is that when you look at
its cognates in other languages you have to come to the conclusion that
the Sanskrit word has evolved into its shape 'ashva' from earlier
forms.  Look, in Old Iranian languages it took the shape 'aspa' [in
Avestan] and 'asa' in Old Persian.  Given the European forms that I
mentioned earlier, it is clear that the underlying Proto-Indo-European
form for 'horse' was something like ekwos.  In order to follow the train
of thought that this conclusion entails, you'd have to take a couple of
courses in comparative linguistics and then Indo-European linguistics.
In any case, it is a demonstrable linguistic fact that the Sanskrit word
for horse has nothing to do with the words for 'syllable' or 'eye' --
except in the imagination of poets.

I do not dismiss the imagination of poets.  But it is a different thing
than linguistic facts.

If you wish to look further into this, see Buck's old classic *A
Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European
Languages*, or the more recent *Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture*
by Mallory & Adams.

Please try to see that I am not rtying to browbeat you with references.
I am trying to teach you something that you do not know.

Again, with apologies.

George

Hmmm.

A defining aspect of what might be called the post modern seems to me the
ability for human beings to destroy the planet. Yes, we've always had the
apocalypse, but God did that. Then around the Renaissance you had the pseudo
Gnostic theories and the beginnings of science, the blasphemous shifting of
Man to the centre of all those circular diagrams of the Universe, a public
questioning of the certainty of certain social principles, the beginning of
print, &c. This (to speak in vague generalities, but there we are, this is
this argument, and of course no borders are clean or clear; and apologies
too for the Eurocentric timeline here) ushers in the Modern: rationalistic
science evolving out of superstition, modern medicine based on observation
of actual human bodies moving on from Galen,  exploration and the New World,
a huge expansion of European colonisation, mass Revolution, and so on. All
this was certainly full of traditional human cunning and cruelty, of course.
But Nature remained stable, capricious, sublime, an endless resource, the
thing that Man exploited and pillaged and wanted to conquer

Once they dropped the bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Man took on the
abilities of a God and could make his own apocalypse. This tended to
undermine the rationalist faith that inhabited the Modern, and shifted the
relationship between Man and Nature, which is to say, Man and everything
else. After that, Beckett, Sartre, Schwitters, Ionesco, Genet...

Now we're well on the way to a mass extinction of the planet's species,
which has never happened before. We won't have a polar ice cap in 50 years.
We live in times significantly more mobile and more media-saturated than at
any time in human history. This means we are more aware of this unique
destruction than we would have been at any other time as well. That's why
people retreat into mass hallucinations like religious extremism,
nationalism and so on. It's like we're in a video that is a re-run of the
end of the 19C, only we're watching ourselves on tv.

The past half century seems to me fairly significantly different from other
epochs. Perhaps Marcus you've noticed that the most technologically advanced
soldiers in the world are no longer Hoplites, and that soldiers no longer
wear bronze greaves. Whether you call it post modern - I guess you might as
well - is neither here nor there. Depressingly similar of course in many
ways, but by no means the same.

There were lots of feminists in the classic days of modernism.

Try this out: Starting some time in the period immediately before and
after the Franco-Prussian War an extremely diverse set of new things
began to happen in the arts and in society in all places where
European languages are spoken (even in colonies, where the European
language was one of several). We're still involved in exploring those
new things and their sequellae. One can choose a very small cast of
characters (mostly in Paris, London, Vienna and a few German cities)
and call what they did modernism to the exclusion of everybody and
everything else, but then one would be forced to acknowledge legions
of proto-post-modernists, and the terms would become rather limited
in their usefulness. There were, for instance, lots of feminists
running around, of course not completely in the mold of current
feminism, but very closely related. As to ethnic, Rivera and the
muralists, Guillen, Lam--the list would get very long very quickly.
Gay? Proust, par example? Lorca?

I'm not saying that nothing changes, I'm saying that the changes
within modernism are not well-served by the term post-modern--it was
just too diverse a phenomenon. A good source for that diversity in
poetry: vol 1 of Poems for the Millenium.

I'm not an academic, so for me the term is only a mild annoyance.
More annoying is what seems to me to be the real import of the
term--as a brand-name, a way of selling a product. The product, I
suspect, is critical reputation rather than knowledge.

OK, I'll sit back now and field whatever tomatoes are lobbed my way.

Alison:

I have nothing to do with Marcus' ideas. I do think that you've
illustrated the meaningless of the term, tho, by stretching it way too far.

The great shock to the European system begins before WWI. The sense
that humans can destroy life on earth begins around then. It gives
birth to apocalyptic science fiction, like the vastly popular War of
the Worlds. The shock happens in the decade in which film and radio
take over and shortly after the invention of the telephone (speaking
of communication) and heavier than air flight becomes a reality--a
pretty big paradigm shift. Of course there's been enormous change,
but it's a continuity, not a breach, since that shock.

Not long ago I asked Ann Lauterbach for her definition of post
modernism. Her idea was that modernists take as their locus the self,
the hub of the wheel, post modernists others, the spokes of the wheel.

You reckon? I was talking about larger movements in human history, in which
such a word might make sense, and said there were no clear borders (look!
Cross this line and we're Modern!) You might as well say that Triassic and
Jurassic make no sense because they're too vague.

And really, there had been catastrophic mass slaughter many times before
WW1. Think of Tamerlane or Genghis Khan. What there hasn't been is the
potential mass destruction of the natural world by human effort. The Aral
Sea and what Stalin did to it, the vast chemical pollution of Europe and
parts of America, the deforestation of huge areas of the planet...if you
want a clear shift of consciousness, the dropping of the nuclear bomb seems
as good a marker as any. It's the marker used by Martin Esslin as the sign
that ushered in Absurdist theatre.  Which also seems to me a decent enough
argument that this shift had profound cultural resonances. It's certainly
the only way in which post Modern (Modern being the Renaissance/Hamlet self
consciousness) makes sense to me.

Yes, agreed, of course, and I agree in general with the rest of your
post [no tomatoes from me].  Inevitably, we have to give in and start
talking about early, middle, & late modernism [and before that, early,
middle, & late romanticism as well].  These -isms are always
unsatisfying, and I'm willing to drop the term post modernism when a
better alternative surfaces.  Are we at a point where we can talk about
early, middle, & late post modernism?  I don't think so. Not quite yet.
But when we do, maybe that better label will have become established.

But aren't there significant differences between early feminism, middle
feminism, and late feminism as well?  Would a Judith Butler have had a
significant audience pre-1950?  Would a film like "Paris is Burning",
where the art of  'passing'  as a woman when you are a man is
celebrated,  have had  a significant audience pre-1950 -- Djuna Barnes &
friends notwithstanding?   And Queer theory?

What audience would there have been among modernists for what we now
call graphic novels?

Would the modernist masters have liked Paul Auster's novels?  Chris
Burden's performance pieces?  John Cage's music?  Mapplethorpe's
photos?  Maybe a Kafka could have liked this stuff, but an Eliot, a Pound?

How prepared for the late 20th century "linguistic turn" would our early
modernists have been?  How would they have responded to Foucault &
Derrida et al?

I don't have easy answers to these questions   Actually, I find
etymology far easier to deal with.  Etymology, anyone?

Muzzy’s Story

Whit Parrot

Whit Parrot was an old man who lived with his dog and his mule in
Virginia up on the mountain near where Mother and me lived.

One day some men came through and said they was a-going to Tennessee and
Maw said “You can’t git there from going this a-way, but if you go over
yonder you can git there.”

Mother made some food for them and they went to a cave and stayed the
night.  Then, next day, they went over Whit Parrot’s and tied him up and
robbed him of all his Confederate money!

Well, we didn’t hear nor see anything of Whit for two days and Maw said,
“I better git over there and see if anything’s the matter.”

Well, she knocked on the door and he was sitting tied up-like, you know.

And Mother knocked on the door and finally she just opened the door and
he was in there tied up and Maw saw him sitting stiff-like, and he said
“They robbed me and it’s your fault, Miss Kinder and they turned over
every stone and took my Confederate money and that’s what saved me.”

And Maw said, “Sit still while I untie you.”  And he said, “I’m stiff!”
And she said, “Well you won’t be stiff when I’m a-through with you.”
And she untied  him and got him loose.  Then she fed him some food and
he got up and about again.  She used to bring him food ‘cause he was so
old.

Whit’d ride that old mule of his across the fields and he’d cuss up a
storm!

He was 80-sum years old when he died and now I’m almost 94.

Dear Poeticists -

Worried about postmodernism ?
Why not try The Formalesque ?

An Australian art historian called Bernard Smith
reckons it's a goer -

http://wwwistp.murdoch.edu.au/publications/e_public/amhope/smith.html

His book 'Modernism's History :A study in
twentieth-century art and ideas' extrapolates on this
left-of-field concept.

All the best,
Pam Brown

Dear Alexander,

There's a collection of essays/articles from a 1985
conference on postmodernism that was held at the ICA
(Institute of Contemporary Arts) in the UK . It's
called simply 'Postmodernism:ICA Documents' and was
edited by Lisa Appignanesi, published by Free
Association Books in London in 1989.
Jean-Francois Lyotard, Martin Jay, Jacques Derrida,
Geoff Bennington, Angela McRobbie and others.
I found it useful some years ago. Perhaps you might
too.
All good wishes,
Pam

three km up from the valley, donkeys, man as pack
animals, and got this flyer from an amerian girl
asking me about ecotourism, and I told her, before we
worry about all those middle class kids coming over
here, mostly girls, young women, and having them have
their jungle sex, how about doing something about the
pollution affecting these mountainsides, that are
about basic hygeine, and we finally moved my friend.
The Tibetans are more like Indians than Chinese,
American, for their sense of individualsim, than
chinese, and liberty, one could argue, should start
here. 6 million people, no more, could become extinct,
like the Chinese did to the Manchu--or are trying in
Xingjiang. It's the government, which liscenses
writers to write, authorizes their very existence, or
kills them, jails them. It's hot, traffic jams in
Shangrila, as rich westerners pass through looking for
redemption, little regard for the Tibetans here, an
economy developing and based on serving the rich and
serve the survents, a little girl lost her legs today
and I slushed through her blood, all the while black
indians pointed at me, and I waved, their hands no
more than stubs--fingers lost in clan wars.

Dear George



Sorry for replying late.



Are you suggesting that in order to understand my mother tongue and/or

Sanskrit, I have to read etymological dictionaries in Proto-Indo-Aryan

German and French ? I don't get this.



I need to read "The etymologies in the ancient Indian Brahmanas" by an
American (?) / European (?) author to understand my language ?



I am a Brahman myself (although I am averse to the idea of practising
religion, I don't) and come from a family that has
taught/researched/preserved/restored Bengali and Vedic texts for about six
hundred years (that's as far back we could follow our family tree). My
grandfather restored very rare Vaishnav and Vedic texts, my father taught
ancient Indian History and vernacular languages at Calcutta University all
his life. Our family donated these texts to the Indian National Library at
Calcutta where they can be found today.



I first learned Sanskrit and Hindi at grade seven. And yes, I can read

some German and French. One of the fundamental Sanskrit stotras I learned
during

my upanayan (sacred thread ceremony) said - you need to feel like dust
first,

weightless and insignificant, need an exercise in humility before the
language

could be learned. Gyan or knowledge could only reach a soul that is comely
and humble.



You seem to leave no scope for that in your rather didactic messages. And
what is

a "Sanskritist" by the way ? There is no such word in the Sanskrit world.
Did you mean "sanskRitagga" ?



I referred to Bengali etymology, (not Sanskrit) which is not an "old folk
etymology"

(as you have dismissed it as) by any means. Like most other classical Indian
mainstream languages Bengali has several tatasama words which are originally
Sanskrit. If you could check any standard Bengali etymological lexicon (most
Bengali lexicons discuss word origins) you

would see that the words "ashba", "akshi" "akshar" are all derived from
"ash" dhaatu (root-

word) and that the adi words had several meanings (not connotations), some
of which are

self-contradictory. You seem to dismiss the texts I referred to (by several
Bengali scholars) most disrespectfully.



Sorry to say, your precocity is audacious. I find it offensive.



Anyway, I'll shut up for good. I am a poet who doesn't like to debate, but
discuss, which

is not happening on this topic. If the poet is a potter, syntax, semantics,
etymology etc. only help him feel the clay he plays with - language. If this
is "off-topic" in a LANGPO forum, I probably don't understand Language
Poetry.



Thanks



Aryanil

*Dear Aryanil,



I can refer to several etymological dictionaries of Old Indo-Aryan in

German and French, as well as dictionaries of Proto-Indo-European in

German, French, Russian, Italian and English, if you could read them.



What you have in these Bengali sources is an old folk etymology.  If you

are serious about looking into this, check out this article, an old classic:



"The etymologies in the ancient Indian Brahmanas" by Jan Gonda, in

*Lingua* 5, 1955.



You should stick with the poetics.  Avoid the etymologies.

I can refer to several scholarly articles by P.C.Sen, Kalim Khan,

Sukumar Sen et al, if you could read them in Bengali. "akshara", "akshi"

"ashva" are all derived from "ash" dhaatu.

Pam,
Mr. Smith's work bears further examination.  Thank you for pointing it =
out. =20

 I share a prejudice espoused in the essay in that I hold firmly to the =
belief that those living in the age...either early on or at the =
waning...are in no position to label themselves from an historical =
perspective. =20

Mr. Smith suggests that the label "modernist" will be expanded to drape =
over the current postmodernists in a kind of broader umbrella of the =
term modernism.  What I embrace from that thought is the implicit that =
the distinctions between the moderns and the postmoderns are =
insignificant when one views performance from a broader perspective =
historically.  It isn't so much that art in 1930 lacks differentiation =
from say art (or make them architecture, or even poetry) of 1980, indeed =
there are recognizable, identifiable elements differentiating the end =
results.  It's more the philosophical precepts of the creators aren't =
really all that different. =20

In any event, I'll return to Mr. Smith's work.=20
Alex=20

  Dear Poeticists -

  Worried about postmodernism ?
  Why not try The Formalesque ?

  An Australian art historian called Bernard Smith
  reckons it's a goer -

  =

  His book 'Modernism's History :A study in
  twentieth-century art and ideas' extrapolates on this
  left-of-field concept.

  All the best,

"Nick Moudry is the rare poet who has found a way to incorporate formal elegance into work with a “conceptual” edge. His long poem “High noon”, released as a chapbook by Indivia in 2005, is at once an elegiac meditation on the fall of America, an indictment of the “cowboy” mentality that has precipitated this fall, a whimsical Surrealistic exploration of “self & non-self”, an exercise in economical melopoeia & a mysterious beacon from an elusive sensibility."

  Nick Moudry's excellent long poem "High noon" is up on PFS Post (www.artrecess.blogspot.com).

  Also, lots new on Stoning the Devil (www.adamfieled.blogspot.com).

the problem, of course, is that these two terms are overlapping, not substitutes
for one another -- much as we've had the problem of people conflating
postmodernism and poststructuralism in ways that they probably would not
confuse modernism and structuralism --

and while there are competing versions of the postmodern (and many here will
know that I lean far more toward the Lyotard side than to Jamesons's
sympomatologies), I confess that I have never quite grasped why so many find
"postmodern" a more problematic term than "modernism" --
Olson's version of the postmodern, rooted more in philosophical disagreements
than in categories of stylistic features, strikes me still as closer to the
mark than, say, Ihab Hassan, to invoke an already almost forgotten name --

Pfui. We can only destroy more people than ever before, perhaps all
of us. But after the nuclear apocalypse something will replace this
cycle of life as this one replaced the "Dinosaur Cycle", for lack of
a better term, after the meteor apocalypse.

Besides, entire populations and cultures have been continually
destroyed through the aeons by disease and genocide. It's not "post-
modern" to fear extinction of one's self, family, clan, city, region,
culture. Human history is the history of such extinctions. To fear
such extinction cannot reasonably be held to be "post-modern" unless
you're prepared to say that pretty much all of human history is "post-
modern" -- which one imagines is beyond what even the theorists of
the post-modern are willing to say.

Still, even if you are willing to say such a thing, I don't see how
it gets us any closer to why a movie-set fire hydrant momentarily
mistaken for a real one (or any other of thes examples offered) is
emblematic of what is distinctively post-modern about the potential
destruction of human life on the planet.

This implies at least three human eras: pre-Modern, Modern, and post-
Modern. That would seem to imply in turn that the most important era
is the Modern, and that most of our effort should go into defining
what distinguishes the Modern from the pre- and the post-. It comes
close to reifying the Modern as a Golden Age, the test by which we
measure the pre- and the post-. But in the Modern era we must put
Hitler and WWII and the Holocaust -- some Golden Age! And the Nazis
were defeated without the use of the atomic bomb, remember: Germany
surrendered before Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

But perhaps that's what you mean by using the a-bomb as a turning
point: that the US irrationally feared the Japanse in a way it did
not fear the Germans, and so could justify dropping the bomb? Are
you, too, suggesting that the post-modern condition is really a
reversion to

"the deeper man returns to his archaic, primordial, pre-rationalist
condition, the further beyond modernism he advances"?

In other words, there are not really three eras of Man, but two: pre-
and post- Modernism, which are both eras of archaic, primordial, non-
rationalist conditions, and Modernism, which is rationalist and,
well, modern and modern.

I argue that in the face of the established zealotry of the Japanese
religion-driven empire and the feared zealotry of the communist-
driven empire, it was rational to demonstrate a willingness to drop
the bomb on zealots. In fact it did demonstrate to the Soviets that
the US was both equipped and prepared to draw a line and enforce it.
Dropping the bomb was not just the final shot in WWII, it was the
first shot in the Cold War.

The world today is such a wealthy and mobile place, so tolerant of
diversity, that zealots can come here, and buy the training they need
to attack us. Which communist was it who said "The capitalists will
sell us the rope we use to hang them"? Soon zealots will be poisoning
the water, and setting off dirty bombs to pollute the air and ground,
and releasing diseases and poison gases. Hundreds of thousands,
perhaps millions, of us will die because of the work of a few hundred
or a few thousand people who are trying to demolish the world of
wealth and diversity that rationality has constructed, however
imperfectly. There is no one to go to war against, no one to threaten
with nuclear obliteration, so that the balance of mutual threat can
be maintained. What the zealots are doing is criminal blackmail, and
they should be treated as criminal blackmailers, not as soldiers in a
war. However many people they can kill they are still only able to
kill some few of us, so long as we keep our rational wits about us,
so long as we treat them as a criminal gang, instead of trying to
hold their religion or their ethnicity against them, and get fooled
into starting the war that they desire.

But it is rationality, not zealotry, that will get us around this
problem. The zealotry, the post-modernism, that you advocate, the
irrationality of post-modernism, the archaic primordialism of post-
modernism, that you advocate, is carrying water for the Bush League,
providing intellectual cover for people who are themselves zealots.
It does the world no good to advocate post-modernism that appeals to
the irrational, to the archaic primordialism, that produced the
Crusades, and the Hundred Years' and the Thirty Years' and the other
wars of religion. In fact, it plays right into the hands of the
zealots who are trying to start the next religious war, the next
clash of cultures, to advocate that we have no choice but to look to
post-modernism defined as an appeal to primordial, archaic, and
irrational responses to the world around us; that we have no choice
but to react post-modernly, which is to say, archaically,
primordially, and irrationally.

Well, to hell with that. I say rationality is the better way.

Sure it has: the dinosaurs together with 90+% of other life on earth
were destroyed by a meteor strike. If we annihilate ourselves and
90+% of life on earth, some other species will come back to make its
own mess of the place without us.

Oh, this is the most utter bullshit. People have been retreating into
mass hallucinations like religious extremism since there were people.
They've killed and maimed and tortured and pillaged and on and on for
aeons. There is nothing whatever different about it now. People
retreat into religious zealotry out of hatred and fear. Declaring
that we should appeal to our own irrational, archaic, primordial
hatreds and fears under the guise of "post-modernism" is short-
sighted, self-defeating, and just plain dumb.

I see no difference at all. Technological advances in how to kill
people have nothing whatever to do with getting us any closer to why
a movie-set fire hydrant momentarily mistaken for a real one (or any
other of thes examples offered) is emblematic of what is
distinctively post-modern about the potential destruction of human
life on the planet.

1) The Last Living Room tonight at SPLAB! Yeah, this is it dear
Friend-O-Splab! Tonight we meet for one last time and then SPLAB!
evolves into something else. Since 1995 I have been active here in
Auburn to create a literary arts scene. In that time we have facilitated
events with Michael McClure, Anne Waldman, Andrew Schelling, Victor
Hernandez Cruz, Joanne Kyger, Adrian Castro, Diane di Prima, Ed Sanders,
Wanda Coleman, Eileen Myles, Jerome Rothenberg and many other amazing
poets. We've facilitated Sacred Circles, Poetry Marathons, Teen Poetry
Slams, Open Mic nights, Workshops and other events. We've tried to
create a sense of community and tonight you can get one last taste of
that at the Auburn Transit Center in suite 100. A new group is forming
to take the torch and Gerald McBreen is going to be the point person.
His number is 253.735.1751 and his email mcbreenpost@aol.com

Thank you for all the amazing events this project has allowed me to
experience. I leave a changed human being and am grateful to everyone
who has contributed in some way to make SPLAB! happen. The
SPLAB!-on-the-Road project, our traveling workshops, will continue and
details will still be at http://splab.org/workshop.html Sound from many
of the poets mentioned above is at: http://splab.org/visitingpoet.html

Please consider attending tonight, to read something you have recently
written, to read the work of someone else, or to come and be in the
engaging company of other writers to practice the lost art of human
conversation.

The WPA is also proud to present on this occasion the *2006 Faith Beamer
Cooke Award* to* **JUDITH ROCHE*. This annual award is given in
recognition of outstanding service to the poetry community of
Washington. A short WPA membership meeting will proceed the reading
beginning at 1:30 PM. New board members and officers will be elected.
The public is welcome. Over a $1,000 will be awarded to the winning poets.

*3) Submit Moon Poems
* The* Washington Poets Association* and the *Seattle Japanese Garden*
invite your submission of poems about the moon, stars, or night sky.
Selected poems will be included in a reading as part of the garden's
*Moon Viewing Festival* on *Saturday*, *September 2, 2006*, at the
Japanese Garden in Seattle's Washington Park Arboretum. From poems
submitted, at least ten poems will be selected to be read. You need not
be able to attend to read your poem, but if you can attend, you'll
receive free admission for you and a guest (normally $10 per person) to
read your poem. In previous years this event has attracted 650+ people
and has also been on Seattle TV news.

*Submission Procedure
*
1. Submit no more than /three/ poems that feature the moon, stars, or
night sky as the primary subject or focus. Poems may be unpublished or
previously published (if published, include publication credit).
Individual poems should not exceed two pages in length. Any genre or
form of poetry is welcome. A sequence of very short poems, such as
haiku, may include more than three poems, but should not exceed two
pages per sequence. Poems may be positive or negative in tone, but
positive content stands a stronger chance to be accepted. Remember that
the audience will be families and mostly nonpoets.

2. Include your name and mailing address with your submission, and
please indicate whether you will be able to read in person or not on
September 2.

3. E-mail poems to both Michael Dylan Welch (/welchm@aol.com/) and
Christopher Jarmick (/glasscocoon@hotmail.com/). Please type or paste
the poems directly into the e-mail message (/no attached files,
please/). Because the poems won't be published, we are not concerned
about formatting issues, but if you have concerns that may affect our
understanding of your work, please explain in your e-mail.

Poets without e-mail can submit via postal mail; if so, please send two
copies of each poem to Michael Dylan Welch, 22230 NE 28th Place,
Sammamish, WA 98074-6408, and include a self-addressed stamped envelope
for reply.

4. If you have a favorite moon/star poem written by another person, feel
free to include/nominate that poem with your submission (contact
information for the poet would also be helpful, if available).

5. *Poems must be /received/ by July 21* (the anniversary of the first
human landing on the moon). Note: Please be aware that this reading is
the same weekend as the Bumbershoot festival.

**Dear souls...

I would like to invite you to entertain the possibility of travelling to Mongolia for the International Congress of Poets in September of this year (2006).

The national poet of Mongolia, Mendo-yoo, a friend of mine that I met  and wrote poetry with there is hoping to have a delegation of American poets be present for the Congress, but time and distance (as well as a lack of someone in the U.S. contacting American poets).  The website describing
this opportunity is: http://www.poetry-culture.mn/

I can tell you after having been in Mongolia three times while helping to establish their national arts organization (Arts Council of Mongolia) that you will find a
receptive, cosmopolitan, literate, and inviting people as well as a culture and landscape that will have you wanting to return there time and time again. For a broader look at the Arts Council of Mongolia and the variety of activities that they are pursuing, you may find their website inviting interesting   www.artscouncil.mn <http://www.artscouncil.mn/> If I may answer questions or be of assistance with regard to the International Congress in Ulaanbataar, Mongolia, please contact me at this email **address, or at 206.938.5277.

You seem to have delberately misread me. But never mind.

When the dinosaurs became extinct, most people believe it was because a
meteor hit the planet, causing massive ecological changes. What is different
now is the element of human agency. It was possible before for people to
believe that even if they died, the natural world as we know it would
continue. But we're taking it all with us: we're in the middle of the
biggest mass extinction since the dinosaurs, losing as many as 50,000
species a year. And we are doing that. Not some plague, not some natural
disaster. We are the disaster.

Of course it links up to the fire hydrant. And to Disneyland, and to zoos,
and to those funny American national parks with pristine roads - the natural
world nostalgically recalled as man intended - artificial, safe, tamed,
mediated. (I realise that humans are part of nature, and that urban
environments are ecologies as much as anything else - this is for the sake
of argument - not that anyone seems to read my caveats).

Perhaps sentient cockroaches will take over in a few million years, but I
fear that I will not be interested when they do.

Yes, I believe I mentioned that in my comment. I was pointing out
that the earth has suffered massive ecological disruption before, and
life, different from the life before the disruption, has returned.
You point that "this has never happened before" is, simply, wrong.
That you don't happen to be interested in it is irrelevant to how
wrong your point is.

When the hordes come, by human agency, they destroy life as we know
it. Oh, sure, what the hell, the village is razed, the men are dead,
the children are traumatized, the women are raped, the crops are
burned, the animals stolen, the wells poisoned, but life "as we know
it" goes on, eh? The problem is that life "as we know it" does not go
on in any meaningful way -- and it was a lot more likely not to go on
back then than now. We are the luckiest human beings who've ever
lived, we in the wealthy West, and the notion that there is some kind
of "post-modern" angst over the wah wah wah that the world may be
destroyed is sheerest bullshit.

The vanity of thinking that our world must be the toughest world in
which to get our minds around our fates is just that: vanity. The
world is a tough place, and a destroyed village ruins "life as we
know it" for the villagers just as surely as if the nuclear winter
had come as a result of a-bombs. It is sheerest fudge to complain
that in these our "post-modern" times we have it the toughest any
human beings have ever had it. It's intellectually dishonest.

Yeah yeah, so what? We've always been the disaster. We've raped and
burned and looted and plundered and pillaged and raped for aeons.
We're running out of stuff to loot and plunder, but we're a
resourceful disaster -- we'll get out into the solar system and loot
and plunder it, and then beyond. Or we'll die. But it's not "post-
modern" to realize that our village may be burned. It's the human
condition. We may find that some human agency we cannot resist
destroys our village; we may get buried in an earthquake or blown
away by a storm or drowned in a flood. The risks are great that we
won't get out of here alive. It's been the same for aeons. There is
no difference now. And fake fire hydrants are no symptom of a non-
existent difference.

So you're now saying that post-modernism is really just a realization
of waste and wastefulness? Are you now trying to persuade us that
this is the first time in human history there's been waste and
wastefulness, or a realization of it?

Well, it seems possible it could be both of those things, yes?

I'm not deep scholar of postmodernism, but as a mere cultural
dabbler, I've run across the idea -- and it seems a decent one
to me -- that modernism and postmodernism (and other such things
as well, but for sake of focus, those) are not ineluctibly "new";
they embody new formulations of ideas and perceptions that have
always been with humanity (in other forms, roots, aspects).
But each era brings its own technologies and social formations
etc. And with those changesome things comes a change in the specific
conformations of imagination that are made possible.  I should be
willing to allow and pleased to proposed that postmodernism (and
modernism before it) has involved -- or we could say, has partly
involved -- certain ranges of how the world's condition is imagined
to be.  Given various shifts of thought, language, technology, and
society, there are shifts in this imagination-of-the-world.  Is it
a novel idea to suggest that "postmodernism" (along with other basic
eras or styles of weltenshauung -- the so-called age of reason, etc.)
have involved differing phrases of imaginational response?  As such,
Alison's point about some specifics of this general situation, seem
Reasonable and apt.  They describe some of the factors involved in
the way currenet imagination and language may imagine things to be.

Dear Aryanil,

You ask: "are you suggesting that in order to understand my mother
tongue and/or Sanskrit, I have to read etymological dictionaries in
Proto-Indo-Aryan German and French ? I don't get this."

No, I am not saying what you think I am saying.  What I am saying is
that native speakers of any language are not necessarily the best judge
of the history of their language.  The best judges of the history of a
language -- any language -- are those who actually take the trouble to
study the history of the language.

Look, how many list members, even the the native speakers of English,
and even the most literate poets among them, know the etymology of such
common and ordinary English words  as "boy", "girl", "book", "apron",
never mind such relatively transparent classicisms like "encyclopedia"?
  Native speakers are notoriously bad informants when it comes to
etymological speculation.  Etymology is an historical science.  It is
not impeccable.  But it is rule-governed.  I try to play by the rules.
If you want to talk about etymology  you should try to figure out how it
works.  In fact, it works the same way in all languages.

With apologies, as usual [and perhaps we should not inflict our
etymological dispute on the members of the poetics list: if they don't
want to listen to it; well, let them tell us, yes or no].

I keep on apologizing, but you keep on being offended.  Sorry again to
have to say so, but you are wrong about these etymologies.

George



Well, I keep on apologizing, but you keep on being offended.  Sorry

Marcus, I am not going to waste my time arguing with someone who
deliberately misreads me. Quite obviously, I was saying that human beings -
I am speaking of human history, not geological history, when I make my
hugely general statements about post modern times - have never held the
capacity to destroy life on this planet before. When has this happened
before? You tell me.

Perhaps we ought to make a distinction between the post modern, an idea of
post-capitalist, post-industrial society, and post modernism, which began
with architecture and is, frankly, more than a little confusing. As I said
in my first post, there are no clear boundaries: each era evolves out of the
complexities of the previous one, and of course there are continuities.
But, as a symbol of a change of possibility and consciousness that one might
call post modern, the dropping of the bomb in 1945 is quite a useful one.

Just a word on those funny American natiional parks. You should know

And there are all the other wild lands, in the national monuments and

Mark,
I lived in Newark; it is not a train stop from Manhattan.  More =
accurately Newark exists in a different zone both of time and space from =
the rest of the nation.  Newark may in truth be the only postmodern city =
in the nation. How many other major metropolitan centers can attest to =
having a mayor who brought the Mafia to control in the city government?  =
Of course the conviction...that's a wonderful story of its own.  =20

And how apt to see the old Newark Bears move to action in this =
manner...though I thought they played baseball, but then I haven't been =
there in ages.=20
Alex=20
P.S. My maternal Great Grandfather, John Weiss, originally from =
"Austro-Hungary," or so it is written on his naturalization papers, =
became a naturalized citizen on Sept. 3, 1888 in Luzerne County, PA.  I =
never knew the man, but they tell me his native language was Slovak, but =
that he spoke, read and wrote German and Polish as well. =20

I did know his wife, my ggmother Mary.  She was born in Bucharest (at =
least some relatives say) prior to emigrating.  She spoke English by the =
time I was born, but she too spoke Slovak as her native tongue.=20

Hello Mark, Alexander, Aldon,

Well of course Bernard Smith's notion of the
'formalesque' does elide the pop term and of course it
didn't catch on - but it was a nice try.

All the best,
Pam

the problem, of course, is that these two terms are

people conflating
postmodernism and poststructuralism in ways that they

find
"postmodern" a more problematic term than "modernism"
--
Olson's version of the postmodern, rooted more in

than in categories of stylistic features, strikes me
still as closer to
the
mark than, say, Ihab Hassan, to invoke an already

Yes, and I'm patiently pointing out that to the villagers threatened
with getting rolled over by an invading horde, it felt like human
agency had the capacity to destroy life on this planet because to
them life as they knew it would indeed be destroyed. They were as
alive to the possibility as you are to the possibility of the
destruction of the human race,
and they felt about the possibility of their destruction the way you
feel about the possibility of yours. You live in a society that is
not threatened by a horde; so do I (in my case, some may argue that I
live in a society that is the horde, but let that pass for the
moment); as a result, our fears of destruction are the fears of a
destruction so large that it would encompass even us. But the fear is
the same: it doesn=B4t matter whether the fear is that Tamerlane or
global nuclear war is coming, the fear is the same. I am arguing that
there is no discontinuity, no "postmodernism", to it -- that it's the
human condition to fear destruction and death, whether by human
agency or by the course of events.

But you're arguing that what continuities exist are insignificant,
and that there is at least one significant discontinuity that has
changed everything, and that has resulted in what you call
"postmodernism". I'm saying that the continuities are significant,
and that the anecdotes you have offered so far as examples of the
significant discontinuity you claim are simply not good examples of a
significant discontinuity. They are, instead, examples of the kinds
of things that have happened for aeons, allowing for differences in
technologies.

I'm arguing the human condition has not changed; you're arguing that
it has. I'm arguing that your examples do not show the change you're
saying they show.

I don't see how. Human beings have been able to destroy whole
civilizations for a long long time, from the small civilizations of a
village to the large civilizations of a region. That they can now
destroy even larger chunks doesn't look to me to be any different.
The human condition is fear that one is not safe; you seem to be
trying to say that your fear that you are not safe is some kind of
special thing, and I=B4m pointing out that it is not special in the
least.

Are you trying to say there is a significant discontinuity that
generates post-modernism, or not? You can't have it both ways. If you
hold that post-modernism is a result of a change in the human
condition, then why bother to speak of "some specifics ... describe
some of the factors involved in the way current imagination and
language may imagine things to be" as a part of post-modernism? It's
like saying "Some dogs have floppy ears; my dog has floppy ears,
therefore my dog is SOME dog" -- it's a semantical misemphasis, an
equivocation if not a joke; and if only a joke, then it is
meaningless in the context of your claim, however momentarily
diverting.

If it is merely a matter of

then there is no Significant Discontinuity that generates
Postmodernism.  If you want to argue that there is a Significant
Discontinuity that generates Postmodernism, then "some specifics" and
"some factors" and "may imagine" and "current imagination" and such
locutions so modify the original strong claim that it is killed by
inches, and dies the death of a thousand qualifications. What is the
difference between Postmodernism that in "some specifics" we "may
imagine" in the "current imagination" that "some factors" may be
"involved", and no Postmodernism at all? I assert that there is no
difference; that once
you accept David's friendly emendation you have abandoned your
original bold claim, and have to accept that postmodernism is no
different than modernism or antiquity after all.

"Like in the aftermath of a 'mesmerizing theater of operations,' Gloria

considered our life. Angry, playful, and unforgiving, these words we
thought belonged to us now see only 'orphans as far as the future can
go."  Ammiel Alcalay

"This poet's brilliant solution in SOLUTION SIMULACRA is to invent a
parallel and much more exciting ethos to the prevailing ill winds of a
culture gone awry with war and little tolerance for dissent. Poetry,
prose poems, polemic exist in a polyvalent, quotidian, urgent universe.
Poetry is, in this visionary powerful response, the rival government.
Gloria Frym is the patriot I'll vote for, every time." Anne Waldman

"SOLUTION SIMULACRA deepens the sensibility that so distinguished
Gloria Frym's award-winning collection HOMELESS AT HOME. The work here
moves between poetry and prose to capture the difficulty of a time in
which, as she writes, perhaps in the voice of a soldier and perhaps in
the voice of a citizen, 'no history will forgive me, no history will
absolve me, no history cares for me.' A great book." Juliana Spahr

Well, presumably if human beings were killing them, unless it was an
invading horde of aliens from Mars, the destruction of the human race wasn't
a question. It may be, as Genet said, that to kill one person is morally the
same as killing a thousand, since the ending of a person's life is the
ending of a universe; but that is an entirely different question.

And if the destruction of species and nature was a part of pre-modern
consciousness, why then all the poems which speak about mankind being like a
wind through the grass,  etc etc etc? Poem after poem which rehearses the
sentiment that the grass, the trees, the landscape are eternal; only
humankind is transient. Not any more.

I'm with Alison on this one, and think Marcus is missing a major =20
point (& maybe remains thoroughly "modern" in his belief in linear =20
sameness or progress of history?) by not seeing that from 1945 on we =20
are in a totally different game.  It is indeed for the first time =20
ever that humans have the power to destroy their own species and the =20
planet. This is a qualitatively situation radically different from =20
all previous human (and animal) situations, where there was always a =20
victor, thus a survivor who would pass that human dna on to more =20
humans, more often than not mingled with that of the victims. So yes, =20=

the species has been murderous from the very beginning, evolving from =20=

(or just into?) real nasty & gratuitous predators, but so far no =20
predator, no matter how vicious, has been known, or has been able to, =20=

destroy himself, his victim and both their species and habitats at =20
the same time. So it is not a question of the same ancestral angst, =20
but of a different consciousness and thus a different responsability.

Culture may be the instigator here.=20
Culture is antithetic to the natural organism.=20
Culture may have spurned things like anxiety.
Culture is definately one way of seeing things.
Culture, in other words, is the only way of seeing things.
This is antithetical to our natural insticts.
Some scientists have problems with this because (a) half of them believe it=
 is the culture that inhibits the formation of the natural insticts and (b)=
 the other half believes it is the natural instincts that must be repressed=
 for the benefit of enculturation.
This "Chicken" and "Egg" problem is also the cause of the widespread AIDS p=
andemic (see Reagan).
In conclusion: Culture no longer defines a specific set of values of a peop=
le; instead, it confines the natural instincts to a marginal status; and wh=
en this status quo is challeneged (e.g. we act out of natural instinct) it =
is seen as antithetical to the given model of culture, and so is met with (=
a) violence (war) or (b) repression (prisons, censorship); this scheme is a=
 generic "Chicken" and "Egg" problem - generic in that it is one sided - on=
e sided in that it is a problem of those in power to decide "Do we attack u=
nlike cultures and enculturate them with our values?" or "Do we repress cer=
tain natural insticts and imprison those who go against the present culture=
?" - which seems to be the problem of continuing the culture by disseminati=
ng its values versus keeping vigilant to protect it; the outcome of this on=
e dimensional problem is, obviously, activism, which is naturally repressed=
 because it goes against the proponents of the present, dominant culture; t=
his activism becomes a culture in and of itself, against the present, domin=
ant culture, and exhibits - in time - values of its own that may be antithe=
tical to certain groups which may oppose certain of their views; thus, we h=
ave the creation of a new culture that is against this old activist culture=
; so forth and so on while the powers-that-be continue to assert power, unc=
hallenged.
The "Chicken" and "Egg" problem is a culture in and of itself, so that the =
reactionary nature of opposition actually perpetuates the survival of domin=
ant cultures, adding to the problem of violence and inequality.

From the point of view of the villagers, the invading hordes were
threatening the entire world of the village; and their fear was that
the the village's entire world would be destroyed. They didn't take
solace, you know, in the thought that "Oh, well, at least the
destruction of our world doesn't mean the destruction of the human
race because whatever else these invading beasts and butchers are,
they're human beings, so it's all good." They were afraid that their
world would be destroyed -- and that's no different than your fear
that your world will be. There is no significant difference in the
two fears: in each the fear is that an entire world will be
destroyed. The size of the world is irrelevant to the nature of the
fear. There is no signficance to worrying about the whole race's or
just your extended family's destruction. The human condition remains
the same.

Tired of arguing on your side? Did you decide you'd take a flyer on
my side of the argument for a bit just for a lark?

The notion that human beings are like the wind in the trees,
ephemeral, transient, just goes to show more clearly that there is no
difference between the fears of the ancients and our contemporary
fears today. There is no significant disruption that marks the "post-
modern" -- it's all the same basic fear: that life is meaningless,
and that to the gods we are as flies in the hands of wanton boys.

Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
Or dwell on your fears, but either way
We exercised our own volition;
Original sin is the human condition.
There's no way back into the Garden;
Since Adam and Eve it's all Post-Modern.

Marcus

no change just a shrinking globe
change is only as suggested  more complete
and instant destruction
back then most knew not of other worlds  so when the
outsider came and destroyed  hand to hand
like in iraq theirs was the only land being invaded
still true like in 9-11  only we got hit
still very small thinking even in global warfare
japan was very far away
they asked me many questions about muslims
and my life in post-9-11 america?
they felt very secure about that in a post a-bomb japan
tho they felt most definitely immediate danger from north korea

why don't we invade north korea  they ask me
a very post-modern question
there's nothing there we need  i answer

it's like my wife's mom passing
it's not your mom it's hers
not your wife but mine  (take my wife please)
not your life
but those in the land being invaded ( take my life please)
we've lived in a total mass destruction world so very long
that tho it's a constant we feel it's like taking a shit
a constipating inevitable
whereas the runs  i.e. terrorism on a personal and global level
is more imminent more archaic yet more "post-modern"
in its reinvented newness

this is a spontaneous jet-lag petty poetry world  disgruntled
personal assessment rant so just dismiss it if you like
people suck  always  have  -  oh not us of course
we don't drop the bombs blow ourselves up
or sanction terror -
we drink coffee & analyze and complain
buy our new shoes
and pet our floppy eared dogs

(my dog is MY doG) my god & that's that -
ah blessed be postmodern antiquity

not only was it a nice try, but it brought to my attention a writer I hadn't
known before -- for which I thank you --

you'll notice that I have not participated in the arguments about whether or not
villagers a millenium ago facing destruction of their entire environs differed
substantively in consciousness as a result from our own postmodernists --

in the world of academe, Romanticists see Romanticism everywhere they look --
Modernists see Romanticists as early Modernists -- and Postmodernists see that
we were always already postmodern -- apparently some antipostmodernists agree
--

which most certainly does not mean that there is no point in trying to make
distinctions and describe shifting cultural eras --

The one thing we should all have learned from poststructuralist critiques is
that it is the condition of possibility of categorizing that the categories
cannot be kept separate from one another --

MAY 31- Two articles, one of great interest to those who want to know a
little more about Bolivias new President,
http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2006/05/16/a-well-of-hypocrisy/

who is welcome to come stay in my house anytime, and another very
incisive article
http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2005/04/05/im-with-wolfowitz/

on the world bank and some of the history of it. I recommend the first
one if you don't have much time, it's really worth it. Both of these
were both written by a very smart and caring man who I once saw giving a
talk in London many years ago, George Monbiot, his website has also been
added to my links section http://www.nefisa.co.uk/links_of_nefisa.htm

- you'll find many interesting pieces there so explore it. On a
side-note, if you've ever wondered just what the world bank is then go
check Wikipedia, they have a good in depth 'overview', right here...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_bank

educate yaself .

Related... I saw a documentary by Sean Langan maybe two years ago... in
fact, here, I just found the link..
http://www.nefisa.co.uk/links_of_nefisa.htm

he was basically travelling throughout South America, and in one of the
programmes, in Argentina, he saw the implications that a lot of the
policies of the World Bank and the IMF were having on the poorest people
there. It was this image of these beautiful children running around a
garbage site miles long, waiting for the truck to come and dump garbage,
waiting for it as if it were an ice-cream van. It really messed me up.
When the truck dumped all those bags of waste down into the site, these
kids ran to the bags, and ripped them open, and ate the garbage. The
rotten left-overs. True it was quite a sensationalist bit of film, but
it's ridiculously obvious that these big financial corporations are the
systems that have the happiness of the world in their hands (to put it
nicely, and poetically). Solutions to all these horrible injustices will
come soon, and some already exist, but as far as mainstream society
goes, we all have to be better educated on these problems, as
intricately as possible, before we start collectively finding solutions.
No use looking for people to blame, it's all about knowing the deal.
Read that first article on Bolivia's new Presidente up above, it's good.

Peace, Y.

Haiti tribunal establishes responsibilities for atrocities
By G. Dunkel
Montreal
Published May 30, 2006 10:12 PM

The Fourth International Tribunal on Haiti, like the three before it,
aimed at exposing individual responsibility for the crimes committed in
Haiti after the United States, France and Canada collectively
coordinated the coup and kidnapping of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide
on Feb. 29, 2004.
Ramsey Clark reports on last year'sCommission of Inquiry in Haiti.

The tribunal's political point about the role of the United Nations as a
front, a tool and a cover for these three big capitalist countries was
sharpened by the fact that newly elected Haitian President René Préval
has not been able to release the hundreds of political prisoners, almost
all Aristide supporters, that the de-facto regime threw in jail. He
hasn't even been able to denounce the agreement that Gérard Latortue,
the president of Haiti imposed by the UN, made giving the UN's CIVPOL
(Civilian Police) control of Haiti's national police (PNH) and prisons
for the next two- and-a-half years.

Held in Montreal May 27 at the Université de Montréal, the tribunal was
a success. Four hundred people, a strong majority of them from the
Haitian community in Quebec, came, even though the Montreal cops had
blocked off the whole neighborhood because an international bicycle race
was using the roads. The tribunal had been widely promoted on French and
Creole radio shows. Parts of the program were in French and Creole, but
most was in English. Simultaneous translation from English to French was
available.

Anthony Fenton, a journalist and researcher, presented Canada's role in
"subverting and destroying democracy in Haiti and destabilizing its
government" both before and after the coup-knapping of Aristide.

Ramsey Clark, former attorney general of the United States who led the
Tribunal's Commission of Inquiry in Haiti last year, put the videotaped
testimony into political and historical context. Clark pointed out that
in 1804, when Haiti won its independence from France--at such a high
cost that perhaps half the Haitian people died in that struggle--the
Haitian people only had to confront one world power. "Now the Haitian
people must confront the whole world in the form of the United Nations,
which is subservient to the United States."

Clark continued: "Unless there is accountability now, the same forces
that killed Dessalines [the leader who declared Haiti independent] and
removed Aristide twice, unless their individual agents are held
responsible, Haiti will not obtain real independence and it is unclear
how long the government put into power by this last election will last.
Never doubt the importance of this commission and its role in supporting
the Haitian people."

After Clark spoke some of the videotaped testimony that the Commission
of Inquiry had gathered was presented.

A high point was the testimony of an old woman who lived in one of the
houses that attachés burned in 2005 under the protection of CIVPOL.
Attachés are freelancers hired by members of the PNH to do their dirty
work--killing and mutilating people--and let the PNH disclaim
responsibility. When the attachés told her to lie down on the floor, she
explained, "I knew they were going to disappear me. So I ran out the
door and away."

Her testimony and that of others established that the UN Mission to
Stabilize Haiti

protected the PNH and its attachés when they attacked areas like Bel Air
when people were resisting. Two UN officers were directly responsible
for atrocities; their cases will be referred to the International Court
of Justice.

Brian Concannon, who was acting as the tribunal's juge d'instruction, a
magistrate who examines the evidence in a criminal case under Haitian
law, closed the session by examining the responsibility of Bernard
Gousse. Gousse was justice minister when these atrocities were
committed, and threw most of the political prisoners in jail.

While Gousse's general responsibility is clear, the only person in the
United States who could testify on the details of his illegal acts, the
Rev. Jean Juste, suffers from cancer and was not available. His deeds
will be examined at another tribunal.

The next International Tribunal is scheduled for Port-au-Prince in
September.

     re parks and simulacra--ther's a great short piece by Poe, done to
accompany a plate engraving, called "Morning on the Wissahicaon", "Morning"
punning on "mourning" as it begins with a beautiful description of a languid
journey i na msall boat through an exuquiste scenery of still wild American
Nature, complete with an emblematic deer and a noble savage--all so
refreshing, so wild, so free, such an escape from the growing cities and
towns!  Yet soon enough the narrator discovers that the "wild" land is a
park recently purchased, tamed and trimmed and shaped by an Englishman,
stocked with tamed animals and that the noble savge is a hired servant
dressed in costume.  Now America is not being colonized, replaced by new
buildings and crop, industries, roads--but by simulacra of its wild state, a
sort of "wild life reserve theme park" run for tourists by foreign
investors--in a bitter irony, the defeated British reclaiming as it were the
colonies for a new form of  exploitation.

     In "The Painter of Modern Life" Baudelaire defined Modernism:

      He (Constantin Guys, the "painter of modern life") is looking for that
quality which you must allow me to call "modernity"; for I know of no better
word to express the idea I have in mind.  He makes it his business to
extract from fashion whatever element it may contain of poetry within
history, to distill the eternal from the transitory . . . By "modernity" I
mean the ephemeral, the fugitive, the contingent, the half of art whose
other half is the eternal and the immutable . . . This transitory, fugitive
element, whose metamorphoses are so rapid, must on no account be despised or
dispensed with.  By neglecting it, you cannot fail to tumble into the abyss
of an abstract and indeterminate beauty . . .

      A little over a century later Warhol offers a postmodern version of
the ephemeral/eternal:  in the future everyone will be famous for fifteen
minutes.

      Whether or not you think the bomb is postmodern in its effects, an
attitude towards it could be seen as a shift in regards to global
extinction:  DR STRANGELOVE OR HOW I STOPPED WORRYING AND LEARNED TO LOVE
THE BOMB.

       And of course it is all right for some nations to have the bomb, but
not others.

       Nearing the very End, Hitler in a discussion regarding the new jets
said that if only one could just reach NYC and destroy even a couple
skyscrapers the effect it would have on the USA would be staggering
pychologically. He believed the Americans were almost incapable of dealing
with an attack on their own soil.  Was the effect even greater when the
attack was done not with foreign planes launched from abroad, but American
ones hi jacked at home?

      In "Compostion as Explanation" Gertrude Stein writes of the interval
between something being seen as new and ugly and as famiiliar and beaitufl
becomes less and less--that the interval between what the artist sees just
ahead, the avant garde as it were, and what the world as whole is, becomes
less and less.  People are more quickly able to recognize in art what it is
presenting of the world they live in.  (She notes that when the first
camouflaged tanks were seen in the streets of Paris during WW1 Picasso
pointed at them--esp. the camouflaged painting--and said--"we did that".) In
the work of Paul Virillio this speed is continually accelerating in the
related realms of the military/surveilance and the visual.

      One of the shifts of post modernity if you will is the  arrival of
television, the transistor radio, ever more portable recording devices, film
cameras both still and moving,  video equipement--all in the hands of
pirvate citizens--alongside the explosion in surveillance devices in the sky
and in buildings, streets, offices, schools, institutions, gas
stations--everywhere.  How many news events that aren't captured by official
cameras are done so by private ones--the Zapruder film--Rodney
King--Abu-Ghraib etc etc etc etc--not to mention armies of papparazzi--the
stray stalker . . . the fan--the next of kin--the seemingly kindly
neighbor--the soon to be ex-husband of one's wife-to-be--the kid with photo
journalism fantasies--a mean spirited co-worker--a random passer-by--

     One is a site of continual surveillance--planned and random--and can in
turn be the site of one's own broadcast--creating a supplemental audience to
accompany  the already imposed one--

     Imagine Emily Dickinson in the world of the blogger writing  her
"letter to the world , which never wrote me"--maybe even taping herself live
on screen as she writes and then holds up the ms so is documented . . .
every idiosyncracy of spelling capitalization grammar and syntax  . . .
every fingerprint . . .

      And aren't there hundreds of thousands --millions--of people doing
just that right now?  (Like us for instance--) Between surveillance and
display--for such massive numbers of people on such massive scales--the
possibilities and probablilities of anything and everything happening become
increased--from the worst nightmare to the best of all possible worlds . . .

Before the arrival of Europeans indigenous peoples in the US
northeast (that I know of, and probably elsewhere also) cleared the
forest understory with controlled burns, making game animals more
visible and affording them with better browse. They could be said to
have harvested rather than hunted, the forests in fact large,
unfenced game parks. One has to wonder what we mean by wild.

In Australia aboriginal peoples still manage their home ranges with
controlled burns.

Newark may in truth be the only postmodern city in the nation. How many other major metropolitan centers can attest to having a mayor who brought the Mafia to control in the city government?

Point of information: the bear was killed in Irvington, the city
nextdoor to Newark, and a place that makes Newark look almost like a
place of hope.  I think of Groucho's "I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
What it was doing in my pajamas I have no idea."  How did a bear get
from the mountains of western NJ to a toilet like Irvington?  Did he
have that little taste?

The Mafia in Newark was not an Italian sole property.  Everyone thought
it was while Hugh Addonizio (cousin of Kim Addonizio, by her own
admission) was mayor, with his backup of Tony Imperiale, that fat bag of
manure whose goons patrolled the streets during the 1967 riots armed
with baseball bats and probably worse.  In 1970 Ken Gibson became
Newark's first Black Mayor.  He also became its most prominent Black
criminal, who got "pro" for a construction fix.  Sharpe James is now out
of power after 20 years of open corruption, politically appointed cops, and

At the risk of sounding cynical "making game animals more visible and
affording them with better browse"--doesn't that sound like making them both
easier to keep an eye on to kill and to be fattening them up for just such
an an occaision?
"Wild" in the way both Poe and myself are using it is meant to be ironic--

What? I've been saying the same thing all along. There seems to be something
amiss with your cognitive skills when you read.

Duh.
