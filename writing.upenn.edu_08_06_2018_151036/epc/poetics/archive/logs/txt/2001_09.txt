Please note that various pieces of e-mail sent to me since June, 2001 have
apparently disappeared (simply been erased). This is a situation that has
resulted in the loss of literarily hundreds of , if not a thousand, messages.

The proposed fix is that my lolpoet address is going to be eliminated and
that people should start e-mailing me ONLY on my glazier account
(glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu). The transition will, in its first phase, take
about two weeks. (No more mail should be lost at that point.) Complete
conversion to the new arrangement will take about one year.

Please correct your address books and files to now use the glazier address
only.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Thankfully, this
mystery that has haunted me all summer now has a resolution.

Please note that mail should no longer be sent to my
lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu address. Please correct your records and address
books so that mail is sent only to glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu. A considerable
amount of mail was lost in the summer of 2001. To correct this, the glazier
address ONLY should be used.

Please note that the URL for the EPC should be referred to as:

and NOT
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc
Any reference to a specific author or other sub-location in the EPC should
similarly be revised. For example, my author page would NOT be referred to as
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/glazier
but rather as
http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/glazier
The new system is more economical and more logical.
Please make a note to check references in your CVs, articles, and other
places and help make standard this more direct method of referring to the EPC.
Thanks!

The Finnish poet Leevi Lehto has recently added to the English interface to=
 his web site, which has much new and interesting material, some generated=
 from a reading Leevi, Arakadii Dragomochenko, and I gave in Helsinki on=
 August 2, 2001, as part of an evening entitled "Language West and East" at=
 Villa Kivi.

Enter at http://www.leevilehto.net/english.asp=20

First you will find a link to "The Four Salutes", our attempt to find a=
 poetry equivalent of the "Three Tenors". This starts with the text of=
 Mallarme's poem. "Salut" and a RealAudio reading in French by the young=
 Finnish translator, Tommi Nuopponen. Next is my quasi-homophinic version of=
 "Salute", text and audio. This is followed by Tommi's homophonic Finnish=
 translation "after" the Mallarme poem, read by Leevi. Next is Tommi's=
 Finish translation of my Mallarmean lyric. You can listen to the sound=
 files poem by poem or together, as we did them in performance.

Next up is the text of my poem "Sunset Sail"; followed by=
 "Iltaruskopurjehdus",
Leevi's Finish translation; followed by Tommi's "Sail the Eveningbreak", his
English translation of Leevi's Finnish translation of "Sunset Sail".=20

Finally, there is an audio file of an excerpt from Arakadii Dragomochenko's=
 reading, in Russian, probably the only audio file of Arkadii on the web.=
 And there are photos too.

The rest of the site is devoted to Leevi's work. I'd especially recommend=
 his digital poem "=C4=E4ninen 2.0 beta", which generates an unlimited=
 number of syntactical sonnets from a fixed pool of  2500 words from his=
 (print) collection of sonnets, "=C4=E4ninen". Readers can control a number=
 of parameters in the generation of the new sonnets.

let me be in your presence and careful consideration this one last time,
i am of this firm belief, and of the hardest on myself; grant me now this;
in this broken life there are some moments of pure brilliance, substance;
let them speak; discard the worst of them; filter and winnow the rest;
i have come from nowhere and will go nowhere; read each and every letter;
give me the ability to fail; let one or another word falter; do not hold;
stave off the fear of oblivion; lift ever so slightly the gravestone;
what must it take to give weight to the words; catch texts from the brink;
as now she could hardly touch the keyboard without her fingers shaking;
presage of a career or futility; she would wake up in fright, sweating,
already she was running out of steam, the book was completed, closed off,
only the idea of obsession; already she felt her death far too near,
she thought, there were nothing to say in her work, or it was nothing,
over and over again, the same or slightly different substance; as if,
would appear the slightest bit meaningful, as if she only wrote once, but,
would ever be considered by itself of any importance, only the obsession
since no particular work, not even the book which took so long to write,
would, in the long run, be considered an idiot savant, horrible failure,
which was, would it not always be, proving impossible, and because of it,
that she would have to, therefore, continue to write at the same level,
that, because of the quantity of her work, expectations were always high,

Dear M. 'Aimonides ("M" for "M'sieur"!)

Jackie and I (“Jacques DeBrot,” that is) transmit heartfelt thank you from here
on floor for your sweetest-flavored epistolary novel installment yet, you
one-man revival you. (Much appreciation for witty Quintus Horatius Flaccus
allusion!)  PLUS germ-free air kisses to those four, unseasonable “boys in the
band” from You-Know-Who!  (J.A. = Jah?  Rastafarian deity incarnation?)   His
late-breaking band name contest entry: try “Ihr Glocken von Marling”. Back to
the topic (poetry) in a min’.

Guitar-strummin’ jailbait sure know Fifth Avenue Botox injections have “Jullich”
facial musculature too rigid, too unnatural, to “scowl” (Ho ho! “scowl” as
concealed “scow” Shoptaw word, meaning vessel with square ends and--- flat
bottom!? Insulting sagging posterior?!) during mid-life crisis vanity phase.

John took whole minutes out of writing truly epochal verse, not at all
self-imitative, to clear up positively everything.  He says HE (John) asked
reapme “interview” questions under name-change “Jacque Debro” ( ) and --- guess
who! --- Jackie “DeBrot” giveth fatted kine answers unto The Master with
misnomer “Joh Ashber”, as zem discipline!  So, all laughter.  All comic relief.
Exhaling thunderous sighs (whew!) as if bee-punctured bagpipe music. It was so
VIRTUALITY-oriented in their mid-to-late-1900s cleverness, I’d say--- nay!  So
Virtuoso of ‘cques ‘brot.  (Marcella D. protests over "vir-" root etymology and
typical males.  But you know ~”her”.~)

Found remaindered copy, not at all encrusted, of that K.K. Ruthven “Felsifying
Literature” title thou inquirest after O these many days (July 25th, ingenious
Oulipo one-letter-later-in-alphabet substitution: “K.K.” indeed) --- and guess
where! --- in the COLOMBARIUM!  I can’t put it down.. And, shop-talk, just
wanted to recommend latest ish of Andy Felsinger’s new “e-‘zine” litBrot.com for
truly thrilling Kent Johnson proposing --- here’s the scream! --- adopting
peudonyms to fool everyone, to follow us around, as best my understanding, as at
costume ball! guessing handsome masked man’s identity.  But only one peevish
question: Say nicknames were one.  F’r ‘xample: Jacques could be “Jack” and John
could be “Jack.”  Then---?

But also, K. Johnson speaks of “Flatland”  (Remember that old chestnut?
Geometry fantasia.)  So appealing, flatness!  Not distended, not convex.  As
flat belly is highly sought after by gymnasium-subscribers.

Off to Fifth Avenue for Botox ‘jection now.  Private jet revvin’ up for jaunt to
Antilles for holiday weekend full moon organ enlargement (just Cacques and I!
{and pilot} the servant class on strike, so foraging for ourselves on knees
digging at tree roots bare-handed).

And thanks, too, for not existing.  For being the Yasusada you are (AND lovin’
it)!   Oh.  And that Jacquesline Kentedy Onansis “Best Loved Poems” book.  Can’t
find it anywhere.  Hmph.  Checked Rizzoli’s, checked Shakespeare & Co. in
Paris.  Where else to look!  You don’t think September 26th publication date
could be delaying things, do you?

Luv,

P.S.  Here’s a little haiku I hardly had time to dream up:

ZZZ-ZZ-Z-ZZZZ-z
Snore?  Power tool?

If there's one thing I detest, in the literary context, even more than the
Brit poetry scene, it's the US version of the same. Which does NOT mean I
detest US poetry. But all these games, these smart-arse ego-strategies,
baah!

As far as I know DeBrot is no poet and I don't know why figures of that
nature deserve attention.

Reach me my Sondheim machine. Generate, generate. Auto-poet plus, honed to
the boredom point, the quotidian of formulaic repetition.

Forwarding this e-mail from Lester:


Actually "Gary Sullivan,", "Jacques Debrot," "Coco Debrot," "Andrew
Felsinger," "Benjamin Friedlander," "Araki Yasusada," "Knet Johnson," "John
Ashbery," "George Chapman," "Mike Magee," "Jordan Davis," "Laura Riding
Jackson," "Jim Behrle," "Patrick Herron," and "Alan Sondheim" are all the
inventions of Julu and Jennifer, my downstairs neighbor.  She (Julu and
Jennifer) is a postdoc student whose expertise is in trauma-induced multiple
personality disorder who also is an expert web programmer owning hundreds of
domains.  She has created a massive and complex web of "facts" and
"experiences" and "histories" and "journals" and "poems" all searchable,
innocuous, and apparently supporting the "reality" of the existence of such
OBVIOUSLY FAKE POETS and OBVIOUSLY FAKE POEMS.  Where else but in Tlön

NOTE:
The above "e-mail" was actually really surely truthfully the product of one
TRUE SOLITARY AUTHENTIC POET-GENIUS:

You can learn more about Lester here:

http://proximate.org/CloseQuarterly/lester.htm

And his up-and-coming journal:

http://proximate.org/CloseQuarterly/

Lester recently made an appearance at the "Flying Saucer" in "Brooklyn."
Among the attendees were folks like "Alan Sondheim," "Azure Carter," "Jordan
Davis," "Nada Gordon," and other creations of some literary fraud-master,
some criminal hoaxer who has set out to destroy the authenticity and
legitimacy of TRUE POETRY and TRUE POETS.

Of course none of this is real, not even the very existence of this e-mail.
Keep searching for what's authentic, "Jeffrey."  Good boy.  When you find
what or who IS real, come out from under that rock, "Jeffrey," and share it
with all of us lost artificial souls.  When you do, the Boy Scouts may even
give you a new patch.


Love,
Lester

The Dummy Poet

PS If anyone else would like to donate his/her "identity" to Lester, please
e-mail him at lester@proximate.org.  Lester assures you this is a real
e-mail address.

PSS  Lester has just written a book and is looking for a "real" publisher.
It's entitled _Be Somebody_ and it's a REAL book.  Oh, seriously, it is.  Oh
poor me, the dummy who cried, "hoax."  Who will ever believe the reality of
anything I say now?  Any recommendations?  "Julu and Jennifer" says that
it's a "cute but confused" book. "Ammonides Diodorous" read it and said it
would make an excellent "coaster."  So it must be pretty functional at
least.

PSSS "Richard.Tylr" is the creation of "Bill Austin," who are in turn both
the creations of a giant white whale recently witnessed in the Indian Ocean
by a crack team of imaginary British poets.

PSSSS  Is a parrot a sentient being simply because it can talk?  Is a monkey
real because it can bang on a keyboard?  Is a dummy alive because it has
string?

PSSSSS  Has anyone seen or heard the REAL President?

PSSSSSS  Does anyone know how to contact the Editors at APR?

            Hi Jeffery,

            Thanks for this. Its amazing as to how this can effect the
effectible. Poor Jan, though. I don’t really sympathize all that much, she
should have been more careful and read what she promotes, as Gary might have
placed a warning label on this. Since I know both Asbury’s voice and Jacques
’;  Jacques is Jacques – this is really an improvement, or more honed down
since his Lacan thingy. Much more in its style than just a stolen interview.
The Lacan post was a wonderful trip into the absurd, but only enraged people
on the obscenity and property issues. However, Jacques will always be more
interesting than a new formalist, I say.
            I am not so sure that this is as criminal as Yasusada, if that
is was that was. I am a bit of a radical and find the art in these, but
since I am outside of the joke, I really cannot applaud as loudly. But I do
recognize that your angered finger pointing (meant with love) is in a
symbiosis on the list with Jacques’ being bad. One cannot have a witch trial
with out a witch and a puritan. Again, with love, as I say, I am down with
Jeffries must stick together :-) However, I am really into property rights
issues and Jacques brings it right out there. I am currently writing a book
length epic poem on Superman, and hope to get into trouble with the hero’s
owner DC Comics. I believe that these property rights issues are the
beginning of a new era of creative hampering in all forms of media. I could
get all flaky in my defense for Jacques faux interview work. Its really
quite good -- but if he did it to Creeley where would I stand?
            In the end this is a great thing to argue on for all poets and
current makers of art. Who owns what and when do you loose your right of
owning after a certain point of becoming a background tapestry to another
artist’s cultural world and thus a part of his/ her art?


            Best, Geoffrey

actually I always found this kind of discussion tedious when it was carried
on in literature, I started out in philosophy but had enough of it by the
time I left, after doing MA work in it at SF State (where one of your
alter-egos went?) It really bores me in literature, I just like literature,
not the pretentious theories, if I wanted that I would have stayed in
philosophy where the theories were at least intended to clarify.

Dear Jeffrey,
I've been looking into the Jacques Debrot ambiguity a bit in the past few
days and I now find myself as suspicious of everything I see as you may be.
In connection with Gary Sullivan I continually encounter the name of poet
Nada Gordon, who may not exist (is she Sullivan's "female side of
himself?")There is also Jack Kimball, have you seen this name? who has a
lengthy CV at http://www.fauxpress.com/kimball/cv.html but may otherwise
not exist. The homepage here is "fauxpress," and links to work by Gary
Sullivan and Nada Gordon. Kimball's credits on his CV include anthologies
of poets from various regions, including Jacques Debrot as a Boston poet.
(Kimball claims to have been a lecturer at Boston University during the
years I was there, I don't remember this guy in the English dept.) He
publishes in TheEastVillage, a link between these questionable people (Gary
Sullivan publishes there too). Kimball's whole CV looks highly suspicious.
Interestingly though he seems to have some real experience with teaching in
Japan, and knowledge of Japanese people--could this lead back to the
Yasusada hoax?
I ran into Kimball as author of an article on Gertrude Stein in an online
journal out of UC Davis called time-sense,
http://www.tenderbuttons.com/gsonline/timesense/review2.html. There were
several articles there that I wanted to index, but now I'm concerned about
the whole journal. In fact, I'm so alarmed about the whole situation in
Language poetry criticism that I'm going to be afraid to touch the subject
as far as building any kind of bibliography on it.
Do you know any more about this?
Jan
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After her firs message, I asked whether she'd received the e-mail from
Jacques that I was cc-ed on.  That's when she started to deteriorate
rapidly.
Like you say, "if "homotextual" means mind-fucking . . ."  You got her.
Pretty "virtual," huh?  Pretty "dada" of you, yeah, sure.
You're only lucky that Harvard awarded you your Ph.D. just in the nick of
time.  A couple of months more and you'd have destroyed your entire
doctorate.
Here (photo) is the face of the innocent woman you've screwed up.


Why'd you cc Diodoros on the message you sent Jan, Jacques?

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I dropped off the editing thread in the midst of a case of mistaken identity
& disillusion with the ability of the poetics list to foster useful debate
regarding the strain of the thread most interesting to me:  relation of
beauty to ethics.

Nonetheless, this list is a fine place to announce new publications, etc.
And to that end:

I've given the Kenning website a face-lift, hopefully making it easier to
navigate and more informative.  Information on the most recent issue (the
Guest / Killian chapbook, OFTEN) & on the forthcoming audio edition
(including a new studio recording of Leslie Scalapino reading the entirety
of her book WAY) is to be found there. The online samples of works from
back-issues of Kenning are still up & still, in my humble editorial opinion,
worth reading.

One note:  as SPD updates its website, the links to Kenning products carried
by SPD might not get you too far.  They will soon bring you directly to
ordering options.  In the meantime, you can order Kenning from issue #10
anon via their e-mail or 800 telephone number.  Available back-issues and
subscriptions come to me, the swell editor.

I must mention this link, it's http://www.skankypossum.com/pouch.htm

where Dale Smith abetted by Kent Johnson achieves the almost unimaginable
feat of being more yawnworthy than Alan Sondheim.

Wow!

the new work


"my beautiful wife and i were walking through the wilderness refuge on the
campus and we stripped naked, one after the other, and we took our poses.
we also took our poses in classroom 105 in building w10. we also took our
poses in several states including north carolina, south carolina, georgia,
virginia, west virginia, and florida.
 we took our poses in motels and cars."

"The Voyage, by Alan Sondheim." "I live around here." "Coral Gables is on
the left and Miami Beach is on the right." "The cemetery is here."

"so that it is time
 for peace to abate
 looming mathematics
 destroys our hate
 comes together in such
 lovely beats
 this demonstration of our
 lonely heartbeats"

"capture that and it's got this delay built in and i can make it move
across and i can take it back and we're over here it's just like that it's
got too many things happening over here and not and not not over across
the ledge over there behind me azure sleeps and my face registers a kind
of death that you can locate somewhere other than the locus of books found
anywhere just about just about here"

"I am Alan Sondheim's beautiful wife. Welcome to Miami.
 I am Alan Sondheim's beautiful wife. Welcome to Miami.
 I am Alan Sondheim's beautiful wife. Welcome to Miami."

"look haughty. let's see. look tarnished. look tarnished. look mad, is
that the next one? i forget the last. tarnished. mad. but then there was a
fourth. no there wasn't. we did all the susan graham pieces. i don't have
anything to say. i don't have anything to say either. did you shoot here.
can you sit down and open your legs? i'm doing it continuously. do you
want to stand up. ok i'll give you the camera. just push it to the.
dropping the camera would end it. ok let me pass you this. i look too
grotesque when i take my clothes off. i don't think you're grotesque. you
have no ideas at all. none at all."

"we were crawling along in traffic and we turned a corner and we continued
moveing over and over again and my eautiful wife thought of me and desire
d me to reveal hr innermost secrets to her. she desired i would remveal my
innermost secrets to her. my beautiful wife and i are giving you this text
as our stamp of approval as our givt to you of our tetnerla love and
everything we have. we condintued moving down the street but no longer
could look out of the window of the automobile our thoughts were only of
each other locked in eternal embrac.e"

"this is my very beautiful wife performing for me.
 i have performed for my husband."

"in the "current" folder, in the "wife" folder, in "perform," compulsive
files, the same ritual, stripping naked, bending back, exhausted beckon-
ings, almost inviting the viewer to touch us, fuck us, my beautiful wife
naked on the bed, lying on her back, raising her cunt to the camera, i am
the great white explorer of holes, i am naked between two charred posts in
the glade, surrounded by wilderness, erect cock, body leaned back into
space. i am grotesque, it is the whiteness against which all inscription
collapses: i can photograph myself naked and abject, but never look at me.
you see the cunt of my beautiful wife and it will never be yours. it will
disturb your dreams just as you disturb mine. my cock is almost yours.
thinking of you reading this excites me; i write through disturbance,
naked, wet, erect. i am performing for you and you have no idea how much
you own of me."

"I am Azure Carter's grotesque husband. Welcome to Miami."

is this as in Alain Bois' formless?

I think attempting to go beyond a 'constantly changing emergence' like
Sukenick's _Narralogues_ is problematic.

Finally a way for poets to make some money...
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/03/business/media/03BOOK.html

If you were going to pitch a company on writing a book of poetry with some
company's products as the centerpieces, who would you pick?

I think I might like to approach Vivendi to write a serial poem that
explores the concept of the value of a voice (of course, extolling the
virtues of "voice as commodity"), maybe centered around a loose plot about
some international corporate espionage where Vivendi is the victim, but
comes out victorious in the end because of their commitment to...  ah
nevermind.  I think I'd rather write real poems that have a chance to win
real awards from real organizations who promote real poets.

It won't be long before a copywriter from Ogilvy & Mather will become the
poet laureate of these united states (if hasn't happened already)...

Two News Items.

First, Wild Honey Press is pleased to announce the publication of a new
chapbook, _Recycler's Handbook_ by William Marsh. This is a chapbook 230 mm
high by 93 mm high, 20 pages long, hand sewn binding. The cover is of 250
gsm white Strata card, and each cover contains a rectangle of fabric tie
dyed by Louise Mac Mahon. To see a selection of poems and an image of the
cover go to http://www.wildhoneypress.com and click on New. Price $7 / STG
5. You can order it online.

Secondly, I plan to publish Maurice Scully's 300 page poem, Livelihood. It's
a poem in five sections with three interstices and, having taken him ten
years to write, is crucial to understanding Scully's work. This is my most
ambitious project to date and advance subscriptions would be an enormous
help. Go to http://www.wildhoneypress.com  and click Livelihood for more
details on how you might support this project. You can pre-order the basic
book, or a book with extra holograph material or become a Friend of Wild
Honey online.

I'd be grateful if you could pass this on to anyone you may think is
interested.

best wishes

Subject: Leevi Lehto website


The Finnish poet Leevi Lehto has recently added to the English interface to
his web site, which has much new and interesting material, some generated
from a reading Leevi, Arakadii Dragomochenko, and I gave in Helsinki on
August 2, 2001, as part of an evening entitled "Language West and East" at
Villa Kivi.

Enter at http://www.leevilehto.net/english.asp

First you will find a link to "The Four Salutes", our attempt to find a
poetry equivalent of the "Three Tenors". This starts with the text of
Mallarme's poem. "Salut" and a RealAudio reading in French by the young
Finnish translator, Tommi Nuopponen. Next is my quasi-homophinic version of
"Salute", text and audio. This is followed by Tommi's homophonic Finnish
translation "after" the Mallarme poem, read by Leevi. Next is Tommi's Finish
translation of my Mallarmean lyric. You can listen to the sound files poem
by poem or together, as we did them in performance.

Next up is the text of my poem "Sunset Sail"; followed by
"Iltaruskopurjehdus",
Leevi's Finish translation; followed by Tommi's "Sail the Eveningbreak", his
English translation of Leevi's Finnish translation of "Sunset Sail".

Finally, there is an audio file of an excerpt from Arakadii Dragomochenko's
reading, in Russian, probably the only audio file of Arkadii on the web. And
there are photos too.

The rest of the site is devoted to Leevi's work. I'd especially recommend
his digital poem "Ääninen 2.0 beta", which generates an unlimited number of
syntactical sonnets from a fixed pool of  2500 words from his (print)
collection of sonnets, "Ääninen". Readers can control a number of parameters
in the generation of the new sonnets.

Gee,  Geedubya's finally venturing out
To find out what foreigners are all about
As a cultural rep he'll convert the Europeas

To see all those Frenchmen speaking French
Or to learn that Germans don't speak Dutch
He'll hang in there trying to keep in touch
When greenhouses and umbrellas make 'em hysterical
He'll tell 'em some things that are truly Americal
He'll explain deterrance and tell 'em to expect

He'll 'splain all these things from A to Zed

The Deal

The erstwhile White House major-domo

We are saddened by thoughts that overwhelm
Imagining a Senate without Jesse Helm.

what exactly is your beef?
falsehood?
artifice?
badness? (the dynamic of which j. "DeBrot" has outlined succinctly for us on
this list)

Your confidence that some faceless bastions at Harvard would be so aghast

the guys at Harvard Law watch Reese Witherspoon's character's

A friend sent me this or I wouldn't have noticed it. Dear List Administrator
, how is this ok? FYI, Mr. Jullich, you were so appalled that I mentioned
your cat on this list and yet you feel free to attack me thoroughly and
namelessly? How bored you must be. Just FYI, my ISp is shutting down, thus
the new email, and I got married, thus the new name. Not that it is your
business AT ALL. Mr. Laura RJ wannabe.

Hi list,

Sadly, a great spirit has left this world. Mary Barnard, whose Sappho
translations are at this point the most widely read, passed away last
Saturday. She was 91. I don't know if anyone on the list knows more
about her, but if so, please tell. She traveled to see Pound and
exchanged letters with Williams. Some of her work was published by
Laughlin. She worked at the Buffalo SUNY Library for a while and
helped establish the modern poetry collection. Her poetry is relaxed
and intelligent. It's a pleasure to read. Maybe she deserves at least
a token obit somewhere, but I'm afraid the big papers haven't noticed
yet, or don't care. Here in Portland, OR there is going to be some
sort of poetic memorial service. I don't know more yet. She grew up
in the logging community, went to Reed in the thirties, and lived
much of her later years in Vancouver Washington (just across the
river).

No need to post any Sappho here. Just search the web for Sappho and
you'll find many Barnard translations. I hope someone at the library,
who knows what she meant to Buffalo and modern poetry, reads this.

Pete

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding:  quoted-printable

Jacques--I read your "had it" post late and was compelled to read it =
through--as it does offer a sound complaint--maybe you articulated =
something a lot of us suspect like when the census comes out to say that =
yes there are more people in new york and you could've sworn the subway =
was more crowded but until then was just your squeezed feeling. Though =
like much of these discussions on the list, (as Mark Ducharme's recent =
poet list itself shows), the conversation and convention you speak of is =
one side of what happens, a faddism, a one upmanism, a "I've read more =
than you-ism". It's a place inside one side and outside of others.(For =
example, utopianism or oneirism) (I resist calling it a male place.  =
It's not, though there is a stroking the phallus aspect to it.)=20

But lemme ask--is there no one contemporary that meets your "highest =
expectations and the heaviest pressures of [your] taste?" (as far as =
taste being obscurantist--I'd say, no more obscurantist than any other =
origin which isn't singular nor mysterious but has its roots and is =
traceable in everything) For me there is one and then a few that almost =
do, which also enable me to invoke the 'highest' and the 'heaviest' =
which are after all, in my case, the closest. The lists of 100, well, =
they are about curiosity and community and democracy, and social =
obligation. It is more interesting to judge us politically on our =
community behavior and judge the work by a more complex web of means, =
that complexity that is a metonym for the complexity of ourselves as =
writers. As in the question, "Who do you read?" Gertrude Stein read lots =
of detective novels, she said, because it was the one place where she =
didn't know how what was going to happen was going to happen.  I think =
implicit is that it was different than her own experience of writing but =
something that she wanted to do, versus something she didn't want to  =
do, which is a good reason, I think, to not read something--if it is =
doing what you know you don't want to do.  As far as I can tell the only =
reason to read what you already know you don't like would be to later =
talk bad about it, which is fun and can connect you to another person, =
but has its limits.                               =20

I write because I have a problem, not because I'm bad. I was bad before =
I was a writer, and now I think I'm very very good, bit not as great as =
two weeks ago when I wasn't working a second job.

PS--another thing that Stein says is that though she got famous _when_ =
everyone read Alice B Toklas, she got famous _because_ of what she wrote =
that no one read. My other words on this are that the gossip is =
effective in creating a platform for the not gossip, but they differ.

PSS--while I took a break to get myself a salad I had the thought =
Jacques, that you too write from a problem. It seems to me upon thinking =
about it, a problem that forced the issue of the 'community' and the =
one. At which you were at least successful in creating a one that worked =
as an everyone. kum ahn -- ya really quitting?=20

And for Kasey--you lost me on your nonhierarchical scale for judging =
poetry. First, I think empiricism contains an implicit hierarchy. =
Second, where's the love?

volute grammar of their noticing" (American Book Review). His essays on
Kelly Wood, Michelle Normoyle, Stan Douglas, Phil McCrum, Roy Arden and
others appear in numerous exhibition catalogues & journals.

Colin Smith is a Winnipeg writer, editor & librarian. His book Multiple
Poses (Tsunami, 1997) was praised for a "wonderfully peripatetic positioning
of angle, the consuming interest in politics, the affirmation of sexuality
and the forbidden, and the unwieldly line, half satiric, half achingly
lyric" (Kevin Killian). His poems have been anthologized in East of Main
(Pulp Press, 1989) and Writing Class (New Star, 1999).

Sponsored by The Western Front, Kootenay School of Writing, Centre for

The reading will be followed by Everyday Life Redux, a panel discussion at

Come tell COMCAST to stop playing MONOPOLY with our media!
Please join us for a Parade and Counter-Awards Show (festive attire &
instruments encouraged)

By law Comcast is supposed to serve the public interest.  Instead they take
full advantage of their monopoly status to charge the highest rates in the
country and denying us our right to Public Access TV.

Comcast will hold their 3rd Annual CN8 Newsmakers Awards at the Prince
where they will celebrate their power and wealth as they aspire to take
over AT&T and the world.  They say they care about community--it's time
they put their money where their mouth is!

The NotCast Awards are a fun way to honor the voices of Philadelphia that
are shut out by Comcast's  anti-democratic, anti-free speech cable
policies, while sending an important message that we oppose their
monopolistic practices.

6:00 PM Meet at Clothes Pin, 15th & Market Sts.
6:30 PM Parade to Prince Music Theater, 1412 Chestnut St.
7:00 PM NotCast Community Awards Presentation
    featuring Keith Brand and Carlota Ttendant

for more information contact PCAC  215-563-1090 or www.phillyaccess.org

Free *MAD* AFTER-PARTY
at the Asian Arts Initiative
1315 Cherry Street, 2nd Floor
doors open at 8:00 pm

food, drinks, meaning, movie
A premiere event for MEDIA TANK, Philly's newest public interest media group

The Perils of a Comcast Monopoly
What difference does it make if Comcast buys AT&T?  With the move towards
an information-based economy, giant media monopolies pose an ever greater
threat to our democracy.  Bunnie Riedel, Executive Director of the Alliance
for Community Media, will explain how companies like Comcast have developed
the technology and policies to turn the information superhighway of the
Internet into a private toll road where they pocket the profits; and we pay
the price.

****Followed by a special screening of the all-time classic "NETWORK" ****

"I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"

An outrageous satire on television that looks less and less like fantasy
with each
passing year.   This multiple Oscar-winner from 1976 portrays the angst of an
aging corporate news anchor about to get the axe, driving him to become a
crazy

Jeffrey Jullich's detective work is good, but has a few holes:


1. Debrot first attributed the Kent Johnson interview to Andrew Felsinger,
then to Bill *Friend*,
misspelling Freind's surname.
2. He then suggested that Felsinger and "Friend" are the same person.
3. Bill Freind had work appear in the same issue of Jacket in which Forrest
Gander wrote about the Yasusada notebooks.
4. Bill Freind claims to live in Providence, a short drive from Debrot's
home in Cambridge.
5. The Providence area is also the home of Forrest Gander, who has
translated the Bolivian poet Jaime Saenz with Johnson.
6. Debrot teaches in Providence.
7. Debrot's ancestry is actually Spanish and as a child he lived in La Paz
for three years. He also
reads Portuguese and has published papers on Fernando Pessoa and Gilberto
Gil.
8. A Google search will reveal that Cola Debrot, Debrot's supposed
grandfather, is actually the *psuedonym* of Jean Niccolas Debrot.
9. A Google search will also reveal that Umberto Eco originally planned to
publish _The Name of the Rose_ ( a book which he described as "a textile of
other texts, a 'whodunit' of quotations, a book built of books") under the
pseudonym Giacomo Dibro.
10. Eco's own surname is an acronym for ex caelis oblatus, or given by the
heavens, a name given to foundlings.
10. Following Eco's Charles Norton Eliot lectures at Harvard, Debrot began
to impersonate the Italian semiotician and novelist, sporting a pair of
oversized black glasses and a Pavarotti-style beard while chain smoking.
11. While nominally a member of the diplomatic service in Uruguay,
Johnson's father was actually a rogue CIA operative who placed illegal
wiretaps on the phones of many figures in Latin America, including Jorge
Luis Borges, Nicanor Parra and the dressmaker of Eva Peron.
12. Johnson is a Mason, Debrot a member of the Bavarian Illuminati and
Gander is considering joining the Shriners.
13. Andrew Felsinger once had a pet tapeworm named Pessoa. After slicing
the tapeworm in two, Felsinger named one half Caeiro and the other de
Campos. He insists his actions were undertaken in the name of poetry.

Subject:      NEXT: the identity of Yasusada to be revealed
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

The identity of Yasusada is now known by more parties than originally involved
(although they are refraining from coming forward).

The undisclosed author of the fake Ashbery poems in readme is one and the same as
the author behind Yasusada.

The author of the fraudulent Ashbery poems/Yasusada whose name is about to be
revealed will be self-evident by five distinct and unmistakable markers:

1.    He/she will be a person with a post at a place of the highest academic
standing and reputation (say, at the top of the Ivy League or that small calibre
of schools).  This accounts for the concealment of identity, up until now out of
fear that it might negatively affect his/her professional reputation and
credibility.

2.    He/she will have recently lived in Japan and/or be distinguished by ties to
Japanese professional societies (again, which he/she feared jeopardizing by
self-disclosure).

3.    He will be a master forger, already proven by the readme "Ashbery"
counterfeits, or by other published literary constructions also under the name of
another real poet/person; but that expertise may be demonstrated as well by
specializing in linguistics or some technical aspect of the English language
and/or a foreign or scientific language, or the manufacture of synthetic speech
specimens.  (Radio transmissions may be involved?  The initials of his/her name
may be very close to mine, or the same as mine!?)

4.    He/she presents as a self-identified Buddhist or a quasi-Buddhist.  Or, he
may be of half-Buddhist or half-Asian parentage, a biographical fact shared with
publisher(s) of Yasusada.  Or maybe look like Buddha.  (Fat?)  (This
half-nationalism may come out in other ways, such as publishing connections to
other English-speaking countries.)  This Buddhism will re-cast any temporary,
futile reiteration of Kent Johnson's constant claim, "I am not Yasusada," with a
whole new significance.  (Johnson has effectively been shown in fact not to have
been capable of authoring Yasusada, and to differ in telling "deep grammar" ways.)

The "am-not" will be heard then as validly expressible from a Radical Buddist/Zem
perspective, as one "is not" one's social security number, "is not" even one's own
given legal name, "is not" one's job/body:  the statement "I am not,"  from that
grounding, will no longer be needed to be taken as denial of Yasusada authorship,
which will be only too obvious! by The Five Markers; or will be understandable as
parsing of semantic nuance at the finest shade of grammatical distinctions laid
out elsewhere in his/her scientific/linguistic materials.

5.    He/she will have publicly identified himself or some enterprise in his
possession (a book title?) by a "clue" name meant to draw attention to the
concealed falsity (whose prefix?) means secret, fict itious, inauthentic, bogus,
such as "pseudo," "crypto," or such.  (In a way that is not clear, it may be a
four-letter word that sounds like the obscene word "f--k."  The only word I can
think like that is "fake.")


This full moon has brought it all to clarity.


(I thank Michael Lutin, Conde Nast horoscope columnist for Vanity Fair, for his
help in leading me to this predictive description, and Jan Pridmore of
literaryhistory.com whose intution empirically lead to her to an answer.  Her
unique bibliographic experience with tracing literary web cross-references sniffed
out the trail with remarkable speed and insight.)

Aldon. Much more likely to find her name bandied around by New Zealand Rugby
enthusiasts who work say as shop assistants or timber workers or sewrage
unblockers?  You should instigate an inquiry into any quoting of anyone
other than eg Bill Shakespear, Rudyard Kipling and Tennyson or some of the
"better" novelists. Its a bit of a worry that you quote Emily
Dickinson...wasnt she a bit "different"? And dont quote Swinburne or Wilde
or even Whitman. Be careful: you're obviously in a dangerous predicament.
It's a trick. Pretend you dont know any writers who are "suspect" or
"strange" etc You know the drill. Cheers. Richard.

I don't know if I'm jumping in on a thread or not (I joined yesterday), but
thinking about educators not knowing about writers: the other night the
final question on the awful game show "The Weakest Link" was about John
Milton. It was basically "Who wrote Paradise Lost". The contestant after
much hesitation came out with "John Cheever???". This isn't so bad in and of
itself, but they did a little post-game follow up with the loser/contestant
who said "My students are going to tease me about this one." She's an
English teacher.

That's up there with the Jay Leno "people in the street" interviews where he
asks them basic current events or historical questions. There was one a
month or so ago where he asked lots of people who fought WW2 before somebody
finally thought of Germany. Many more questions finally yielded the idea
that Germany had been led by somebody named Hitler. But it took even more
questions to get a first name -- including one answer from a school teacher

Michael Moore does a version of this that I found a little more fun.
It's called "Beat the Rich" and he basically asks people questions, some
of them found on Park Avenue or somesuch NYC area and the other group
are people around the streets of some Pennsylvania(?) town. Hilarity
ensues.

Questions for both sides too, like what is a good year of Merlot?; and
what do you do if the toilet isn't flushing?

My fave was a question about the price of something ordinary (of course
memory wants to fill in the blank with "gallon of milk," but I think it
was something else), and a woman in the NYC/urbane sections answers with
something like, "In francs?" She was counted as wrong.

The "non-Rich" edged out a victory in Michael Moore-like fashion. Seek
it out in the Awful Truth compilation if you have a comfortable Michael
Moore filter. The same collection has the Sodomobile episode which is
definitely worth a watch.

Regarding the TV shows where people say they don't know who fought Wolrd War II, don't forget that Jay Leno and Michael M=
oore et al all have staffs that work overtime to make sure that ordinary people look stupid.  Those clips are heavily edi=
ted!  It is all for effect, don't trust them.  There's a local version of this routine that runs here in San Francisco an=
d the people who produce it were in despair because too many people knew that D H Lawrence was a novelist and not the cen=
tral character in Lawrence of Arabia.  They scrapped the segment and instead determined to make people look stupid by ask=
ing people about stem cell research.

Like that's really difficult ha ha!!

It is a heartless practice to make people seem dumb, when half of the time they are smarter than the producers, they may =
not know how to express themselves well.  But, it is a relatively cheap way to produce TV, because you don't have to pay =
the talent, just show them up.

Ditto with what Kevin K. said.  At least Leno does those things for a =
cheap laugh, without Moore's utterly hollow and loathesome "ideological" =
justification. We have a show here where Americans on the street are =
asked questions about Canada, the sole purpose of which is to add to the =
already overloaded sum of Canadian smugness.  Needing to be re-assured =
about the stupidity of others is not a healthy sign, and it's sad to see =
it crop up on the list.

I was sitting at a cafe on its festive waterfront, near the large, goofy Ho

the street. The way they could swivel their hips would make Little Richard
proud. "Ladiman!" the man at the next table exclaimed.

Having never heard that word before, I asked, ‘What's a ladiman?’”

Mary Barnard was one of the best US poets of our time. I still have
not read a Sappho that has the heart that Barnard's Sappho has.
Williams certainly owed something to her. Check Paterson.

Yeah

it's brilliant

if it's lies, slander, egomania and melodramatic portrayals of self you want


it's just the place to look


but as for poetry, well, forget about that


it's not on the agenda

Reminds me of William Witherup's, "After My Breakdown"

----------------------------------------------------------
After my breakdown
I tried Compoz.
I went back to Brylcream.
I joined the Dodge Rebellion
and the Pepsi Generation.
I flew the friendly skies of United.
I put a tiger in my tank.
I ate the Breakfast of Champions.

After my first relapse
I filled my cupboard with Wonderbread,
my icebox with the beer beer drinkers drink.
I packed into Marlboro country
sporting a fresh tattoo.
I arrested death and decay with Macleans.
I killed body odors with Jade East.
I fought  despair #100 with Excedrin
and pain #200 with Anacin
and anxiety #600 with Contac.

After my second relapse I cured myself
with Gillette stainless steel blades.

This poem is worth a fortune today!

According to Robin Hamilton:

Robin, my understanding is that Sonnets to Chris is the title of the
original 1947 manuscript which Berryman shelved for 20 yrs.  In 1967 it
comes out as _Berryman's Sonnets_ - never as Sonnets to Lise, tho, yes, in
the '67 book "Chris" becomes "Lise" in the poems (for instance in Sonnet
4).  The question of why these poems sat unpublished for 20 yrs is
pretty interesting since, as I say, style-wise they predict the Dream
Songs (in fact, Giroux rushed them to press b/c the Dream Songs were
already scheduled to come out).  The reason for the change to Lise in
1967, I always assumed, was because "Chris" was a code-name for "Lise" -
so in '67 it's a) safe to fess up, and b) chic to (con)fess up - remember
this is the period when Lowell is dropping chunks of his ex-wife's
letters, without permission, into *his* sonnets.

So, there's my take.  My dissing of Berryman aside, there's a lot of
interesting writing there - tho these days if I want Elizabethan jive talk
I go to Kasey Mohammad.

As women were thought not to have souls, we were aligned with animals,

People, Here is a corpse from May, with contributions from three poets.  I
hope it can be much longer, larger, and when it reaches the right length,
I'll present it on meaningless.com

Thanks----

The long and tedious body in the bodice of fingers
broken in toward the lake of disinterested eye
that light in the window which winces mechanically
as hours shrink to fit the tiniest of holes

torn into numbers to feed the plow
it means nothing to me to say hello for
the ribbons of rhythm dictate such a collar
might indeed produce the moment of its declaration

    "The body that what will, is."

The body loves its mandibles, delights,
Clucking spare parts like a mantis.
Or under the water grunts and groans,
Liking sport like the manatee likes cabbage.

    "What, in the night, thinks the body wet?"

The body eats its melons, sure.
But what grows from my seed patch now?
Say! I think it's a batch of pink monkeys!
I will send them out in a canoe, green and stripey.

    "What will the body think of next?"

The body loves to rumba, Pop.
So please excuse me while I kiss the sky.
Please forgive me while I light my gas-soaked slacks
and dance the burning stinkbug dance!

    "What does the body think of that?"

next?

FIFTH SUB VOICIVE COLLOQUIUM
Sub Voicive Poetry in association with Contemporary Poetics Research Centre

How do we perform that!?
Birkbeck College
30 Russell Square, London W C 1
Rooms UG1 & UG3
Saturday 29th September 2001; 10 a.m. - 6 p.m.
Bulletin 4

The theme is, as above, "How do we perform that?"

Contributors are: Sean Bonney, Ian Davidson, Allen Fisher, Loss Pequeño
Glazier, Jeff Hilson, Dell Olsen, Lawrence Upton and Mike Weller

Registration: Everyone attending must be registered and preferably *in
*advance. It is a big waste of valuable time registering people on the day.

The colloquium fee is £12 for a full *or a part of the day.

You may register for only £10 *if you register in advance by Tuesday 25th
September 2001. Send a cheque payable to Lawrence Upton, 32 Downside Road,
Sutton, Surrey SM2 5HP to arrive by 25th September 2001. (Please include
your name and address legibly!) Receipts will be available if requested with
your postal registration.

Concessions are available at £5 on exactly the same principle i.e. they must
be received by 25th September 2001

Late registrations will be at the full rate. No receipts.

NB The named contributors are automatically registered already, without
charge

This is as cheap as we can make it. This year there are costs which have not
been incurred before, but we are holding the admission charge. It is vitally
important, therefore, that as many of you as possible support us by
attending, not just because of SVP's commitment to pay costs incurred but
also because the colloquium is predicated on the belief that it is good to
gather and talk about our writing and it's pointless if you don't turn up

Lunch arrangements: Tea and (instant) coffee should be available more or
less continuously all day, once the urn has boiled, and we'll throw in a
selection of biscuits. No charge if you have registered.

Lunch: There has been no interest in the scheme to bring in fresh sandwiches
at previous colloquia, so this year we aren't even offering. N.B. Not
everywhere is open on Saturday and there is hardly time to go to the pub
without coming in unsociably late. So we strongly advise you to bring a
packed lunch.

Bookstall: It is hoped to provide a bookstall facility. Further
announcements about that a.s.a.p.

Send in your registrations!!!!!!

How do we perform that!?
Birkbeck College
30 Russell Square, London W C 1
Rooms UG1 & UG3
Saturday 29th September 2001; 10 a.m. - 6 p.m.
Bulletin 4b

NB Do not send ANY correspondence regarding the colloquium to Russell Sq. It
may get lost. All correspondence to 32 Downside Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 5HP

Bookstall:

Any relevant publication (books, CDs etc) is eligible for inclusion on the
colloquium bookstall which will run for most of the day less time for set up
and close down.

Just as we want to separate registration for the colloquium from the
colloquium itself, we do not want book-selling to impede the colloquium; but
we believe making publications available is central to the day. Therefore,
there will be one bookstall only and it will be run, as before, by Invisible
Books. There are a few rules which, if followed, will make for efficiency.

* Please put a post it note with the publication price on every item unless
the price is clearly displayed on the publication already

* Please supply an itemised invoice, allowing the standard 40% discount, for
your entire contribution. The invoice should show title, publisher and
quantities

* No arrangements beforehand are necessary. Please bring your books in the
morning and take away unsold books in the evening

* Please do not add your publications to the table or start your own
separate display. Deal through Invisible Books or don't deal.

* Please do not send publications to the colloquium. There are no facilities
for receiving publications in advance or for storing them after. No
responsibility is accepted for publications not handed to Invisible Books on
29 September and / or not collected from them on 29 September... Publishers
are of course welcome to make your arrangements with colleagues so that one
person deals with the bookstall on behalf of 2 or 3 publishers.

Settlement will be cash (where and if possible) or cheque ON THE DAY

OK, I was guilty of a snide comment to the list today, myself (to
Aldon--which was followed in the next paragraph by a sincere attempt at
collegiality), but I really don't understand this appended message.

Skanky Possum (apart from the Pouch) is where the poetry is, David.  The
Pouch is perhaps most notable--to me, at any rate--for its frequent
publication of work by Linh Dinh, a wonderful poet and short story writer.

And I loved the baby picture.  Congratulations, Hoa and Dale!  He fills your
pouch nicely.

aloha, Susan

Dear Jeffrey Jullich,

Define "same".
(You're colder, um, than a corpse encased under the tundra.)

Everyone has something to lose, obviously, in doing something daring.  The
"nobody" might lose any hope of ever publishing just as the "somebody" might
lose a high-falutin' reputation.

The point isn't to CONCEAL identity or protect identity.

Now THIS is funny.  "Master Forger."   Sounds kinda dangerous.   Ever seen
Welles' "F for Fake"?

Oh, now you got me!  I am a Buddhist and Professor at Yale who programs
speech synthesis modules on the side.  I lived in Yokohama and Hiroshima off
and on for two decades.  I have changed my name many times.  You will never
learn who I am.  I am already dead, though my body can be found on display
in many centuries in different store windows and gutters.  I ate liver with
fava beans while lunching with Pol Pot, we were fellow students at the
Sorbonne.  What's puzzling you is the nature of my game.  Hoo hoo.

Or a former Buddhist.  Or a Buddhist-who-is-not-a-Buddhist.  You've narrowed
the list of possible poets on this one to everybody.  You left out
Gnosticism and Kabbalah.

Deep grammar?  Please explain....  Anyway, I'm just baiting you.  It is best
to explore not the hocus-bogus "deep grammar" fluff but instead examine what
cryptographers call "fist."  This is sincere advice.  In doing so you will
make an example of yourself as someone who misses the point of poetry.  The
point is...

You obviously DO NOT GET IT, Jeffrey.  Reduction to Buddhism reveals only
your own limitations.
Corollary 1:  Just because you don't get it doesn't make it uninteresting.
Corollary 2:  Because you do not get it, it might be very interesting.  (And
whaddya know...it IS interesting!)

Giving clues is of the essence in such a project.  It isn't meant to deceive
people so much as it is meant to actually attract non-narcoleptic readers.
The text acts as some sort of litmus test.  It requires that the reader be
awake.  Sleeping readers will miss the point.  Consider it a poetic
separation process... 1) attentive readers who can separate fiction from
fact, 2)readers who understand the poetic, philosophical, and social
implications of what it is and what it is not to be an author in the Age of
the Cult of the Author and the Era of Solipsism and Confession.

There are many big issues I believe are addressed in _Doubled Flowering_
including:

1.  the construction of a book (as opposed to the construction of a
collection of poems)
2.  issues of race and the taboos surrounding race-conversation in the US,
"right" ways of speaking about race, and the appropriateness of the
connection between text and author in the context of race
3.  market pressures of author-cultism (ever read "Poets&Writers," for
example?) and its restrictions on writing
4.  philosophical issues about writing and process (the muse as a window to
a broader conception of self; the ambiguity and arbitrariness of self and
personal identity, the possibly "selfless" act of inspired writing)
5.  trademark, intellectual property issues, and ownership in the internet
age
6.  quality of writing as gauged by "consistency" of writing and the
pressure on poets to be a brand name by virtue of 1) the 7.  consistency of
the style and quality of writing and 2) the relationship between poetry and
its author
8.  the internet as an opportunity to escape the limitations of being
someone not currently in favor
9.  the possibility of conceptual imagination
10. the need for artistic illustration of the horrors of the US Nuclear
Holocaust of Japan, and the need for providing avenues for criticism of such
present-day horrors in an age where journalists who show up on the scene to
cover US Foreign Policy atrocities first-hand are now invariably silenced by
murder--we need to be able to speak even if we are being killed (so we speak
for each other, and, more profoundly, we MAY BE one and the same in death
and in life, and the elaboration of that possibility is a wholly poetic
function)
11.  the possibility of altruism and its conflict with a culture of law,
property, and cynicism

You see, I think it was you who wrote Yasusada's master stroke.  I remember
writing it and am still amazed no one figured it out yet.  We wrote it
together, remember?  It was written by no one.  This is not a koan.  George
Bush may have written this.

PSS Counterfeit, fraud, forgery?  They're looking for new cops everywhere.
A cop can make a better living than a poet.  Though I guess us Ivy-League
sorts would not dare to become underclassed officers of the law unless it
were for the CIA or NSA or DIA.  Little handgun say, "Ca-chink, pow."

Well, Susan

maybe you've read a different Pouch from wot I did, haven't checked back at
it, so maybe it's changed, but the last time I looked it seemed to consist
of a pile of abuse from Dale Smith at named individuals, aided and abetted
by Kent Johnson.

Of course, if that's your idea of a poetry magazine, who am I to argue?


Best ( yawning for someone)

Well, yes, I've noticed invective from time to time, but this latest pouch
looks terrific and I am really pleased that they support the work of writers
like Linh Dinh.  And Skanky Possum itself publishes lots of writers worth
reading, I think.

Oh well, Susan

I agree with that, Susan, which is one of the reasons I'm so taken aback
with what's in the Pouch.

All the Best

pot-smoking hippies in Michigan this week.  A dead Milhouse Nixon gets an

1. Call for Proposals Incubation 2002
2. Incubation Archive Now Online
3. Stop Press Talan Memmott talk in Nottingham 17th September
4. September offer continues at the trAce Online Writing School.


1. Call for Proposals for Incubation 2002 to be held on 19-21 July 2002 at The Nottingham Trent University, UK

We are pleased to invite proposals for Incubation2, the leading international conference on Writing and the Internet. For our second conference we continue our focus on the role of the internet and telecommunications and particularly invite contributions that address the way new media create new potentials and re-define the acts of writing and reading. We welcome proposals on all aspects of new media and writing, especially by those whose work is based in new media, on or off the internet. http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/


2. Incubation Archive Now Online

For three days in July 2000 trAce provided a platform for the most essential voices on the web today. Writers, critics, theorists and web-artists came from around the world to speak at Incubation at The Nottingham Trent University. Incubation Archive is the online record of this dynamic event. It includes audio, text and electronic versions of presentations and performances; information about contributors; a gallery of photographs taken over the three days, and the background of the conference itself. The Incubation Archive website was created by Mary Cavill. http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/


3. Stop Press Talan Memmott talk in Nottingham 17th September

_Technontology and the [Ap]proximate Other_

trAce/Alt-X New Media Writing Competition winner Talan Memmott is currently visiting the UK and we are delighted he has found time to give a talk on his work at the Clifton Campus of  Nottingham Trent University at 2pm on Monday 17th September 2001. The talk is free of charge but please email trace@ntu.ac.uk or call 0115 8486360 to let us know you are coming. For updates watch the trAce front page at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk

Talan's offline interpretation of Lexia to Perplexia using three whiteboards was a highlight of Incubation 2000. Nobody else can talk so entertainingly about network life with such a mix of humour, art, and high theory. We do hope you can join us in Nottingham for this unique opportunity.

See his award-winning site Lexia to Perplexia at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/comp.cfm.

funny to see .edus migrating back unto their Fall
semester blivious to all the summers talk talk abt
names, false identities, 'Who is the author of . .
.?', peculiar timing spontaneous re-route into whimsy

in the context of

latest New Yorker magazine cover-story sept. 3 on the
newstands all this time, a cautionary tale?  there the
names weren't yasusada silliman

the names were james hogue a.k.a. alexi santana a.k.a
jay mitchell huntsmen, lon grammer, mauro cortez jr
a.k.a. maurice de rothschild, gina grant

what could motivate a person to do such things

Subject:      Translation, Chinese-English in particular
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I'm trying to assemble a list of recent English-language translations,
borrowings, imitations, etc., of Chinese poetic texts.  I'm interested in
whole books, of course, but also individual works published in journals or
on the web, which usually go unnoticed, at least by me.  My motive at this
point is simply curiosity.

If anyone has come across (or published) interesting work, I would be
grateful for a reference.

More generally, one might ask which languages and literatures are now
perceived as fresh sources for American poets writing in English.  I have
the sense, shaky though it may be, that in U.S. poetic circles there is
little curiosity about non-Western writing, and that the curiosity that
does exist tends to be motivated by identitarian considerations rather than
artistic ones.  It's hard to believe, though, that this situation isn't
changing, given globalization.  If we're lucky then maybe new translations
will offer an alternative to the current stalemate, in which academic
authorities of this or that variety police the literary culture, rewarding
conformity to this or that stale notion of poetic value.

It has to be a mistake, though, to assume that the U.S. is inevitably going
to be the site of convergence for world culture, and that everything worth
knowing about will eventually make its way here.  So, where and in which
languages are the alternatives being sought?

Summi Kaipa lives in San Francisco, where she edits Interlope, a journal of
innovative Asian American poetics.  Kaipa's critical and creative work has
appeared in In These Times, San Francisco Bay Guardian, Rain Taxi, St.
Mark's Poetry Project Newsletter, Chain, Rhizome, Kenning, and Fourteen
Hills Review.  Her first chapbook,, THE EPICS, was published by Leroy in
December 1999.  Her most recent literary endeavors have appeared in
self-published chapbooks entitled FORECAST or SOME OBSCENE DARE; WESTWARD
HO; and IN THE EVENT OF THE TROPICS, YOUR CUSHION IS ALSO A ROSE.  She is an
arts administrator, who also sometimes doubles as curator and freelancer.

Taylor Brady was born in Dunedin, Florida in 1972. He has lived in Tampa,
Sarasota, Brooklyn, Buffalo, and, since 1998, San Francisco. For the past
five years he has been writing an extended serial poem, TO NOT, whose parts
include lyric, prose poetry, a novel, and a series of short essays. Sections
of this project have appeared in several journals, and in the recent
chapbook 33549 (Leroy, San Francisco, 2000). A chapbook containing earlier
work, IS PLACED/LEAVES, appeared in 1996 from Meow Press in Buffalo. The
first book-length installment of the To Not writings, MICROCLIMATES, was
published this summer by Krupskaya (San Francisco).

Originally from Texas, Standard Schaefer now resides in Los Angeles, where
he co-edits Rhizome and Ribot. His first full-length book, NOVA, won the
1999 National Poetry Series, and was issued from Sun & Moon Press this year.
His first chapbook WALTZING THE MAP was published by a+bend. He teaches at
East L.A. Community College and at Otis School of Art and Design.

Andrew -

Sorry to perhaps stray a little bit away from your request...have you read
Yunte Huang's _Shi: A Radical Reading of Chinese Poetry_?  There are some
wonderful translations in the book of Chinese poetry, and the author takes
pains to approach translation in a careful and multifaceted way.  I highly
recommend it for anyone interested in either translation or Chinese poetry,
and especially for those like yourself who seem to have an interest in both.

Best,
Patrick

Wow, I sure wish I could be there for this reading.  I recently read and
loved Standard's fantastic _Nova_, and Taylor's poetry is more fascinating
perhaps than his incredible knowledge of music.  That's saying a lot.  Go
see & listen to these folks if you can.

Best,
Patrick

Hi Andrew,

In the upcoming Fall issue of 3rdBed we will be publishing two pieces that
may interest you.  The first, by Alan Soundheim, draws upon Chinese number
theory.  The second, by Robyn Schiff, is written in relation to (an
invented) Chinese Scroll.

The issue is do out in a month or.

Best,
Andrea

the work of the crazed

why this work matters even when written under duress
why philosophy cannot disregard theory responsive to illness or depression
notes towards the problematic perception of worlds
inscriptions faltering along fault-lines of explanatory discourse

depression and/or illness as a gateway to truth because of
 decathecting of concern - beyond that of inscription - almost
 as the skittering of inscription
depression and internalized anger: potential eidetic reduction
 to substance - (bemused inability to focus/catatonic: to think
 purely eidetically -> absence of thought)
                          /* who is writing this?
                             i refuse these labels! /*
illness as the distraught of the world -
 as the distraught of the word - 'holding onto the book' -
 the book as secret/ive discourse -
release of the book as the decathecting of illness,
 not the re-cuperation or re-presentation of health -
 not the therapeutic

the eternal road of the book as foreclosing problematic ontologies
the book as world and object
always misrecognizing the real
truth and hopelessness

the crazed of the work

You could do worse than to start with Yunte Huang's book Shi: A Radical
Reading of Chinese Poetry (Roof, 1997). Of course, there's much else to
be said after that, but Yunte's book served well to illuminate for me --
who had no real knowledge of Chinese literature(s) or the issues
involved in their translation -- what some of the pertinent areas of
inquiry might be.

F R I E N D S

After 3 aborted attempts I have finally completed the beta version of
my tribute to Philadelpho Menezes.  I must confess that I knew very
little of his art & activities until receiving the announcement of his
death
over several of the mailing lists of which I am a member.

I was harvesting the seeds of False Blue Indigo (Baptisia Australis)
that day &  my immediate instinct was to form the newly harvested
seed(signs)
into the letters of his name & scan them into the computer.

Over the last year the intended tribute never really fell into place.
When
attending E-Poetry 2001 at SUNY-Buffalo, Wilton Azevedo presented an
inspiring tribute to Menezes' work which more than anything informs my
own attempts at an intersign tribute.  Also meeting Brazilian
poet/theorists Giselle
Breugelmann & Lucio Agra  at the festival insured that I had living
contact
with a body of work that until then had only been virtual.

theory because this is miami.

strengthening to hurricane status and flood watch for southern florida
boats on fire in fort lauderdale and trees broken in north miami
moisture index high and drawn into central miami towards ludlum avenue
windstorm down ludlum avenue taking a right on 46th street
green anoles crawling down 46th street taking a left in the sunken drive
monitors walking slowly over speed bumps crawling up the soaked walls
wall of water over the second story slamming into 252 where we're
soaked and crawling, strengthened to ward off anoles but not anomalies

because of the persistence of academic affairs we are not allowed to shut
the doors of our offices if there is a student of any degree of opposition
sex within. the halls of the department of art are filled with television
cameras - we're pure exhibits - we're there for them; there is nothing to
steal but our imaginary. the cameras hug the ceiling like green anoles,
their burst eyes flooding us with marrow for thought. let me tell you that
thought.

eyes damage thought, spear thought; they glare through dreams in which we
edit dreams to our liking. they are vectors of configuration; they divide
and cauterize space. there is a corner of the secretary's office in which
we are unwatched, cutting each other with thin knives; the blood drips
anonymously were it not for dna. azure carves out my cock:  EIDETIC
REDUCTION  and in return i damage her breasts:  CHORATIC EFFLORESCENCE.
i reduce or am her reduction; she extends or turns my exponential. in
front of the cameras, for an unseen audience, we mutilate.

because this is miami, blood pours from our mouths; we leaving fast in
this theater of the real. when we fall into the range of the cameras -
when we are seen - we are covered with blood, our sight gone; instead,
silent, with infinite wisdom, we carry the truth of theory, the
efflorescence of thought, forever towards our almost immediate death.

because this is miami, we will wake up thick after our performance; the
faked blood is cleansed like the dust-free department of art staring at
us. just before we leave we'll show them everything than shoot out the
lights.

There's this really sweet guy who's been coming to my reading series for the
past three weeks to read at the open mike.  He's diligent but totally
untutored and writes lyric love poems and elegies in singsong meter with
simple, powerless end rhymes like me/be, do/you, and so on.

Yesterday Michele Kotler and I had a chance to talk with him before the
reading started.  Michele was one of my featured readers and she's the
founding director of Community Word, a program that sends poets into the
public schools to facilitate creative expression workshops.

John, the elegiac rhymester, said friends had told him his poems would sound
more "professional" if he didn't rhyme.  He clearly felt inadequate because
he "didn't know much about free verse."  Michele and I replied that there
are more and less interesting ways to rhyme.  She talked about rhyming in
the middle of the line so that the rhyme becomes a kind of door hinge.  I
told him to avoid rhyming throwaway words and try rhyming words that pack
more of an emotional punch in the poem.  There was a great example in the
poem he had brought for that day's open mike.  It was about his mother's
death of cancer.  I told him that while me/be was a rhyme that didn't do
much for the poem, me/chemotherapy would knock people's socks off.

What was nice is that he got it and he was so grateful for the ten minutes
of workshopping Michele and I gave him.

But what made me want to write about this incident was the experience I just
had buying a cup of coffee at my local hole-in-the wall, blissfully
nonStarbucks coffee place. Lubo, the Romanian counter boy, was playing a
Beatles CD, and John Lennon's "The Word" was on.  In case you've forgotten,
that's the one on Rubber Soul that goes

Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
It's the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard? The word is love!

and so on for some 2 minutes 39 seconds or so.  How thin is the line between
inanity and brilliance!  I couldn't help thinking of the other John, my
elegiac rhymester from the Ear Inn, and how I would like to shove this song
under his nose and tell him that rhyme and meter can do you proud if you do
them right.

Of course, context is everything.  If "The Word" were presented as a poem
rather than a song, it might be inane indeed.  But with it's astounding
vocals, harmonies, arrangement, and production, it's an anti-love-song
love-song, proto-psychedelic classic, typically brilliant John
Lennon/Beatles/George Martin at their peak.

I don't have a grand conclusion, really.  I guess I'm simply struck by how
difficult it can be for nascent talent to be nurtured in the way it deserves
to be, and how easily creative passion can be extinguished by the casual,
ignorant criticism of so-called friends.  And how Rubber Soul still rocks
after 35 years!

"It has to be a mistake, though, to assume that the U.S. is inevitably going
to be the site of convergence for world culture, and that everything worth
knowing about will eventually make its way here.  So, where and in which
languages are the alternatives being sought?"

Damien Leri, a good friend of mine now living in Portugal, is working with a
British guy named Ray Keenoy to put online Ray's series of reference works
on literature in translation known as the Babel Guides, which seem to be
completely unknown in the US. The site promises to be much more than a
reference work, and should help promote literature in translation in many
ways (and facilitate new translations). I'm the only US ingredient here,
having brought these two blokes together. I'm excited.


Damien writes about making the site multilingual:

"RE SUPPORTING OTHER LANGUAGES BESIDES ENGLISH:
Am i being naive in dreaming of a multilingual site? Requirements include:
1. allowing the cataloging of published translations in a language other
than english (eg, the portuguese version of Jarry's supermale). Finding
people to add to the catalog would be the tough part, since the babel guides
don't cover this.
2. supporting interfaces in different languages. We would need people to
create and update language mappings, so that if the user is viewing the
German version of the site the appropriate translations will appear in place
of text such as "born on" on an "author's" page. A web interface for
updating these mappings is no problem.

One path we could take towards multilinguality is to design the database
models and programming to support other languages and yet have a preference
(ie increased speed) for the english interface. We could enable the other
language options when and if there are people to maintain the other
languages' interfaces and catalogs, understand users' feedback written in
these languages, etc."

2River released today the 6.1 (Fall 2001) issue of THE 2RIVER VIEW, with
new poems by Wendy Taylor Carlisle, Laura Hartman, Romana Iorga, Elizabeth
Knapp, Ann Neuser Lederer, Walt McDonald, Mark Melton, Allan Peterson,
Matthew Schmeer, and Leonore Wilson, and art by David Zvanut. You can read
it online or download a PDF by going to

Also, beginning November 1, 2River will begin litter pick-up along a
stretch of adopted HWY E in Jefferson County as part of Missouri's
Adopt-A-Highway program. The remote 2-mile stretch of highway is a highly
unlikely spot for a sign that says Poetry, Art, Theory. Look for a picture
of it in mid November.

Since 1996, 2River has been a site of poetry, art, and theory, quarterly
publishing The 2River View and occasionally publishing individual authors
in the 2River Chapbook Series.

THE DENISE DUHAMEL FAN CLUB

There were a few years when Nick and I thought
we just couldn't adjunct anymore.  We'd sit at night
around piles of student papers and poems
until one of us would say, There's got to be a better way.
We're creative people, right?   I used to ask Nick
Can't you go be a gogo boy at Deja Vu? or whatever
strip joint we were living next to at the time.
And, of course, I was only kidding, but if he would have said
OK, maybe I'll go in tomorrow and if it's not too gross...
I probably would have felt relief.
                             Then, one night,
after reading a few too many comma splices, Nick said, I've got it!
I'll start the Denise Duhamel Fan Club!
He figured he needed 3000 fans at $15 dollars a year
(We'd keep $10 and the extra $5 would cover his operating expenses.)
There'd be two annual mailings, the basic photo
and fact sheet, my likes and dislikes.  He'd get a computer program
to keep track of all the club members' birthdays
so I could send their bonus birthday cards
like Johnny Matthis sends to his fans.
Hell, he'd cut up my wedding dress and send every fan
a piece.  I'd cut off my own hair and send every fan
a clump.  He'd promise club members would see my poems first--
sneak previews before they appeared in Chiron Review
or Free Lunch.  I could probably even e-mail those
and save the postage.  We could hold a special contest
for fan club members only--a raffle in which the winner
would be able to take me to dinner!
                                                                   Then Nick
said, So how many fans
do you think you have?  In all our zeal, we'd forgotten about that part.
I figured I had maybe 35 tops (counting relatives,
most of whom would want a free membership).
Nick insisted I must have more fans than that.
But, even if I did, how would I know where they lived?
How could I send them a fan club application?
It was, and still is, every poet's dilemma--
how would I ever make a living?
how would I ever reach my readers?



A SESTINA OF SEPARATE MIX AND MATCH COORDINATES
TO PACK FOR YOUR MLA INTERVIEW

Start with a solid skirt
(A-line or full, depending on your figure), a matching blazer
and a pair of pants--
pleated or perhaps with a cuff.
Then pack a turtleneck and a blouse
so you’ll be ready for any weather.  Pump

up your resumé, then put on your low-heeled sensible pumps.
When you get to the interview, skirt
any questions about where you bought your blouse--
your top button securely fastened.  Blaze
on with confidence about how you’d teach comp, prepare off-the-cuff
anecdotes about your former students.  Soon the committee will be panting

over your creative handouts.  Be sure to pantomime
their enthusiasm, gently pumping
them about when they’ll be making their final decision, your handcuffs
tucked in your briefcase to give you confidence.  The outskirts
of the conference town await you, ablaze
with dingy night life, where your same blouse

and skirt will become a kinky schoolmarm costume, where blousy
curtains of a cheap hotel will barely disguise the pants
of the man you choose, his cheeks blazing
with shame as you pump
up his grammar.  His eyes will skirt
yours when he can’t define the conditional tense, so you’ll cuff

him to the bed, putting the key to your handcuffs
down your blouse
and smoothing your skirt,
watching the lump at the crotch of his pants
slacken.  This fantasy will keep you alert as the interviewers pump
up their writing program, their own ties and blazers

dry cleaned to perfection, their own Chevy Blazers

parked safely at home, their cufflinks
in little ceramic boxes atop bureaus, near the spray pump
bottles of their wives’ perfume.  Your nipples push against your blouse--
there is something warm and pleasing in the crotch of your panties.
Their lives are the lives you want--a decorative skirt

around a Christmas tree, a blazing fireplace, a ruffled blouse
just for the holidays, lounging pants, a box of cufflinks
for your future husband.  His hand up your skirt, your red ink pumping.




LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT


I leave my pink toes to the pink seahorse facing west

I leave my summer lawn chair to the blue hare who lives in Berlin

I leave the airholes in my sneakers to the library where I read my first book

I leave my pork pie hat to the pig who needs it most

I leave my bunions and onions to the constellations

I leave my empty wallet to the virgins

I leave my dimples to whores who play Uno

I leave my worn-down lipsticks and dried-up nail polish to archeologists

I leave my eyeglasses to the glamorous

I leave my unused shampoo and fig newtons to the turtles who claim them first

I leave the hair in my comb to the mice

I leave the hoopla over Hallmark to the gurgle of shellfish

I leave my last nickel and instant lotto ticket, the silver gray flakes, to
the hall of good luck

Check out the list of translations of both poetry and fiction at the
Modern Chinese Language and Culture resource page at ohio-state:

http://deall.ohio-state.edu/denton.2/biblio.htm

And look up Zhang Er's work (not sure if it's on that list or not)...she
has some amazing chapbooks in translation, Winter Garden (Goats and
Compasses), Verses on Bird (Jensen/Daniels) and The Autumn of Gu Yao
(Spuyten  Duyvil).=20

Also look at Rift 4, the transpoesis issue, archived at:
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/rift/rift04/rift0401.html esp. the chapbook
extension with a piece on Avant-Garde Chinese Poetry from 1982-1992
translated by Wang Ping with comments Yunte Huang....Patrick Herron is
right to recommend..._Shi: A Radical Reading of Chinese poetry_

Mmm. The two volume anthology, Poems for the Millennium, edited by
Pierre Joris & Jerome Rothenberg is uh...both experimental and global in
focus.

Mark Nowak does an amazing magazine called Cross Cultural Poetics
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/mags/xcp.html (there used to be a whole
"Cross Cultural Poetics Web" online but I don't know where it
went....)which features translations every issue as well as a bunch of
other great work in poetics and the sort of interdisciplinary stuff that
makes me excited.

Apologies if other listers have already mentioned these. I'm in digest
mode.

The Barnstones

Misty Poet and Post-Misty Poets

is an excellent introduction, too.

Currently, I am working on some translations of Bei Ling, who is considered
a "Post-Misty". Two ran in The New Republic in March, but since then I have
gotten nothing but rejection...alas.

Robert Grenier's 1998 talk at SUNY-Buffalo, titled "Realizing Things," is
now available at the EPC:

http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/grenier/rthings.html

Among other things, Grenier discusses Emerson's essay "The Poet," his
(Grenier's) sense that "'the new world' remains  to be discovered," the
shift from typed to hand-written poems (i.e. the scrawl), etc.

Foundational
0.  The writing of the Comte De Lautreamont, especially Maldoror (perhaps
the most influential work and surely part of the foundation for Surrealists;
use only if you like to have something that "leads to" surrealism)

Essential (if I could use only 3 sources)
1.  Andre Breton's book _Manifestoes of Surrealism_
2.  Bunuel & Dali's film, "Un Chien Andalou"
3.  _A Book of Surrealist Games_: Captures the spirit of surrealism in a way
no other work has.  Is fun, wonderful illustrations and photographs, and has
games, plenty of games, as promised.  Compiled by Alastair Brotchie.

Wouldn't Skip
4.  The art of Salvador Dali, Lenora Carrington, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy,
Hannah Hoch, Marcel Duchamp, Frida Kahlo, and Rene Magritte.  This covers
cut-ups, photomontage, painting, and sculpture
5.  Luis Bunuel's "The Phantom of Liberty" (many other films of his are OK
but I think this one is the most "surreal")
6.  Benjamin Peret's _The Hidden Storehouse_
7.  Meret Oppenheim's art, especially "Dejeuner en fourrure."  Oppenheim's
fur tea cup deserves its own line here.

Very Useful (if you have the time)
8.  The dream sequence from Hitchcock's "Spellbound" - set by Dali
9.  _The Automatic Message, the Magnetic Fields, the Immaculate Conception_
by Andre Breton, Philippe Soupault, Paul Eluard, David Gascoyne
(Translator) - great survey of surrealist writing
10.  _SURREALIST WOMEN: An International Anthology _, edited by Penelope
Rosemont
11.  _Liberty or Love!_, Robert Desnos
12. _The Theater and Its Double_, Antonin Artaud
13.  The photography of Man Ray
14.  The work of Adolf Wolfli.  He was doing cut-ups, montages, and
automatic writing well before the word "Surrealism" was uttered. His
photomontages presaged Paul Klee's rhythmic art and Warhol's pop art.
Wolfli's music presaged minimalist and algorithmic music.  Wolfli was not
part of any movement but was actually a lifelong patient of a mental ward.
Breton was one of the early purchasers of Wolfli's work and help start
Dubuffet's famous Art Brut tour.  Wolfli was perhaps the only "natural"
surrealist.


Work by Jan Svankmajer may also be useful.  there's also an interesting
survey of Surrealism and its relation to alchemy called _Max Ernst and
Alchemy_.

I'm not smitten by Breton's _Nadja_ and do not include it.  If it were not
for any of these other works I listed above, I would have mistakenly
believed that Surrealism were as dull as _Nadja_.

Joan Retallack's book of poems "How to Do Things with
Words" has a section/poem called "The Chinese Room"
(or words to that effect).  She's drawing upon a
problem in the philosophy of mind, proposed in
philosopher John Searle's essay, "Minds, Brains, and
Programs" (and subsequent discussion by Fodor in
"After-thoughts: Yin and Yang in the Chinese Room",
etc).  Although somewhat racially insensitive in
Searle's original shaping of it, the Chinese Room
problem that Retallack refers to is, basically:

You have somebody in a room who doesn't know Chinese.
You give them a set of Chinese flash cards, although
they don't speak Chinese, and a set of grammatical
rules for Chinese syntax.  Somebody outside the room
can see only the ideogram output that's constructed.
When the person in the Chinese Room succeeds at
forming entirely intelligible "communication," despite
not knowing the language, ~what is the nature of this
language-thing that the reader outside the room is
reading,~ --- since it's uncomprehended by the
sender/speaker but understood as normative by the
receiver/reader.

That model is really the base for an investigation by
analogy as to nature of mind--- It's a sort of Turing
test.  (To Turing-ize would be to dispense the person
in the Chinese Room and have it just be a machine
that's sending out the messages, and the reader's
inability to tell whether talking to a man or woman,
since talking to neitherk, etc.)  It may seem
tangential to your question, but --- In Retallack's
use of it, it takes on a new, poetic resonance, and
is, by itself, I think, an unforgettably bothersome
sort of thought-experiment.

Jeffrey

Hi poetry people,

This does't have much to do with poetry but for those of you support small
presses I thought that you might also want to support this independant
film.

The Bingo Robbers is hilarious.

If any of you go. Please say hello to the film makers and tell them I sent
you.

Thanks,

Kevin

PRESS RELEASE

St.John's Filmmakers attend New York Festival


THE BINGO ROBBERS:

Award-winning feature-film, The Bingo Robbers, ( A Cinequest, San Jose Selection) written and directed by Lois Brown and Barry Newhook is screening at the New York International Film and Video Festival followed by short, TV Talk Show Live directed by Rhonda Buckley. The screening at the Clearview Cinema 239 E59th Street (btw 2nd and 3rd Ave) will be held SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 16th, 2001 at 8:00 pm with a reception to follow.


"The answer to a movie lover's prayer" (The Evening Telegram)

A tightly plotted tale of two eccentrics who screw up a series of robberies - mostly because they can't stop talking - is smart, edgy with snappy dialogue to spare. Vallis (Barry Newhook) lives in his 76 Chrysler. Nancy (Lois Brown) loves and depises her deadbeat drummer partner-in-crime. The two cruise the gloomy streets of Newfoundland's biggest city bringing us their darkly comic observations on love and violence, while plotting the best way to take down the 24-Hour Bingo Extravaganza.

"There isn't a slow moment in this movie...engaging, wonderfully written" (Brokenpencil,Toronto)

Best Feature at Toronto International DV Festival. Winner of Best Actor, Outstanding Writers and Best Original Music Composition at The Atlantic Film Festival.

TV TALK SHOW LIVE:

TV Talk Show Live is directed by St. John's artist Rhonda Buckley, and written by Lisa Moore and Rhonda Buckley.


TV TALK SHOW LIVE. Is it real? Is it art? TV Talk Show Live is a parody on talk shows. The guests on the show are artists, who argue and unravel video art in the 21st century of mediamania. The host, Rick Boland, is a genius, although he has delusions from the very medium that captivates him-TV. Watch as the guests and host of TV Talk Show Live reveal the many pixelized images of art and television. In TV Talk Show Live you may not know 'what is fact and what is fiction' or more precisely, 'what is art and wha tis television'?


TV TALK SHOW LIVE STARS: Rick Boland, Berni Stapleton, Sherry White, Jon Whelan, Geoff Younghusband, and Andrea Cooper.


FILMMAKERS LOIS BROWN, DANA WARREN AND RHONDA BUCKLEY WILL BE IN ATTENDANCE.

At the duration press site, under the international poetry section, I have
been working on bio / bibliographic entries for non-US poets. It is still
very much under construction, but there are some entries for Chinese poets
with links to on-line work, as well as a bibliography of works in English:

thanks for this, it helps me to theorize what others consider banal verse
that i find powerful because of context.  it also helps me give advice to
friends who rhyme weakly.  i love anecdotes like this; i collect them.
more please from one and all.

Yunte Huang, in addition to SHI, also edited a section of poetics by contempory Chinese poets for *99 Poetis/1999*, a special issue of boundary 2 I edited a couple of years ago, and which is still available (info at http://www.duke.edu/web/dupress/b2.html). The poets included are Che Qianzi, Hunag Fan, Yi Cun, Lan Man, as well as the manifesto of the "Original Poets".

Perhaps this is a good time to announce that the new issue of boundary 2 (28:2, Summer 2001) has a substantial Poetics cluster, including my conversation with Geoffrey O'Brien on the Library of America anthologies of 20th century American poetry, Rob Wilson on Pamelu Lu's *Pamela: A Novel*, Kathryne Linberg "Depejorating 'Uplift' and Re-centering Race Poetry: Lorenzo Thomas's *Extraordinary Measures*, Keith Tuuma's "Way Out in the Center: John Matthias", Michael Davidson's  "X Marks the Spot: Laura Moriarty's *Nude Memoir* and Jena Osman's *The Character*", and Daniel O'Hara's "The Pen Shop of Thomas Kinsella".

"POEMS FORM/FROM THE SIX DIRECTIONS"
A multidisciplinary project by Eileen Tabios


ATTENTION ALL POETS: You are cordially invited to Eileen Tabios' marriage to
Poetry.  RSVP by Oct. 15, 2001 by sending a poem to PinoyPoetics@aol.com:

Culminating a four-year poetic alchemic process, Eileen Tabios will exhibit
sculptures, drawings, installations and a wedding ceremony during her
May/June 2002 exhibition at Pusod Center, a program of the Babilonia Wilner
Foundation (BWF), in Berkeley, CA. The exhibit features the results of her
attempts to cast poems as physical bodies and/or multidimensional spaces.
Her series is titled after the Native American concept of six directions:
north, south, east, west, up and down.

Reflecting Six Directions' concept of making the Poet's persona seamless with
the world, the exhibition will include Ms. Tabios's collaborations with
quilt-maker Alice Brody, musician Joey Ayala and poets Paolo Javier and
Barbara Reyes.  To further reflect her project's desire to draw in the world
into the space of her poems, the exhibit will feature two guest artists:  New
Yorker/New Zealander artist Max Gimblett, whose use of alchemical materials
and archetypal references empathizes with Ms. Tabios's poetic approach; and
V.C. Igarta, the foremost artist from the Filipino "Manong" generation who
emigrated to the U.S. in the early 20th century.

A key work in this series will be "Poem Tree," featuring Ms. Tabios's
original wedding dress.  "Poem Tree" evokes the Filipino wedding tradition of
guests pinning money on the bride and groom's clothes during the wedding
celebration to offer financial aid for the new couple's life together.  "Poem
Tree" will be pinned with print-outs of poems to symbolize Ms. Tabios'
wedding to Poetry.  To integrate the (external) world into the (internal)
world of Ms. Tabios' poetry, all the poems pinned to the dress are written
and will be sent by other poets from around the world.

Poets are invited to share in Ms. Tabios' installation of "Poem Tree" by
e-mailing her poems (no longer than one page) to <PinoyPoetics@aol.com>.  The
poems will be printed out and its hard copies will be among those pinned onto
"Poem Tree."  No poems will be rejected as inclusion is integral to the
concept of Six Directions.  Poets should include names and geographic
residence in addition to e-mail addresses.  Deadline for sending poems: Oct.
15, 2001.

During the exhibition's opening, a special appearance will be made by the
wedding dress of BWF founder Malou Babilionia. Poets wearing Ms. Babilonia's
and Ms. Tabios' wedding dresses will dance with members of the crowd.
Attendees will be invited to pin poems onto the dresses. During this
"happening," the crowd also will be invited to pin real money onto the gowns.
All monies raised during the event will be donated to BWF's efforts to help
reduce environmental pollution and facilitate a better understanding of
economic, cultural and ecological conditions around the world. Ms. Tabios
considers the fundraising attempt appropriate for indicating how Poetry can
make a difference -- that Poetry can feed the world.

EILEEN TABIOS has written, edited or co-edited seven books of poetry and
fiction since 1996 when she left a banking career for poetry.  Most of Ms.
Tabios' poems and fiction are inspired by the visual arts, and she
occasionally writes on the works of other artists.   Her poetry CD produced
by Jeepney Dash Productions, THE EMPTY FLAGPOLE, includes a discussion on the
inspiration of abstract expressionism for her poetry.  Her awards include the
Manila Critics Circle National Book Award for Poetry, the PEN/Oakland
Josephine Miles National Literary Award, a Witter Bynner Poetry Grant and
Poet Magazine's Iva Mary Williams Poetry Award. Her forthcoming books include
PINOYPOETICS, the first international anthology of poetics by Filipino
English-language poets; SCREAMING MONKEYS, an anthology of prose, poetry, and
visual art about cultural portrayals of Asian America; and MY ROMANCE, a
collection of essays correlating the visual arts to poetry.  She is also the
founder and editor of Meritage Press, a multidisciplinary literary and arts
press based in St. Helena, CA where she is researching the poetry of wine.
On December 13, 2001, she will participate in a panel presentation
"Ekphrasis: Poetry/Art Collaborations" with poet John Yau and artists Archie
Rand and Max Gimblett; the event will begin at 6:30 p.m. and will be held at
the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10021.

You said it, Michael.  By the way, Michael Jackson is now broke.  Seems that

The whole thing sounds crackpot. What's the purpose of it? Surely this is
just an arbitrary and meaningless exercise? Why not calculate the
probabilities of balancing an one hundred thousands eggs in a vertical tower
in a 200 kph wind at lattitude X longitude Y?  Richard.

A poetic parrot! Ah! Now maybe there's something in this......it is my
brilliant belief that animals, and birds in particular, are poetics beings:
parrots of course are the least poetic in appearance: their colour usually
clash etc...they are good for Mony Python skits...but keep on with your
parrot. Something will come of it. Of this I am sure. Yours, Richard.

2 Planes Crash Into World Trade Center
By TERENCE NEILAN

Two airplanes crashed into each of the two towers of the World Trade Center
in Manhattan this morning, in what the F.B.I. says is a delibrate attack.

Bridge and Tunnel Closings
Airports       All New York City airports are closed.
Subways        All subway lines are closed until further notice.
Bridges        All bridges coming into Manhattan are closed.
Tunnels        All tunnels coming into Manhattan are closed.

Within a span of 18 minutes, planes crashed into each of the twin towers of
the World Trade Center in Manhattan soon after 9 this morning in what
President Bush said in a short announcement was "a national tragedy and an
apparent act of terrorism against our country."

Later, witnesses reported two explosions at the Pentagon building in
Washington, setting off a fire, and the White House was evacuated.

All airline travel within the United States was suspended and Mr. Bush was
said to be on his way back from a visit from Sarasota, Fla., to Washinton.

Mr. Bush said in Sarasota he had ordered that "the full resources of the
federal government" be used to carry out a full investigation to find out
who was responsible for the World Trade Center attacks.

"Terrorism against our country will not stand," he said, before ending by
leading a prayer for victims of the attacks.

Smoke and fires poured out of the towers, and there were early reports of
six deaths and thousands of injuries.

Witness accounts differed over what kind of planes were involved in the
impacts. One witness told CNN television that the first plane seemed to
slow and deliberately line up before crashing into the north tower.

A witness who works in the strategic planning department at The New York
Times, Alan Flippen, said that as he came to work on 46th Street just
before 9 he saw an American Airlines Boeing 767 flying "very low in the
direction of the World Trade Center towers."

He said he did not see the impact, but later reports said one of the planes
that crashed into the towers was an American Airlines plane that had been
hijacked on a flight from Boston.

In Washington, officials said the F.B.I. was investigating reports of the
hijacking before the crashes.

Heavy black smoke billowed into the sky above the gaping holes in the side
of the 110-story twin towers, one of New York City's most famous landmarks,
and debris rained down upon the street, one of the city's busiest work
areas. When the second plane hit, a fireball of flame and smoke erupted,
leaving a huge hole in the glass and steel tower.

All New York City-area airports were shut down, and several subway lines
were immediately shut down. Trading on Wall Street was suspended and many
businesses were ordered to evacuate their personnel.

SEPTEMBER 11, 10:40 EDT

World Trade Center Collapses

NEW YORK (AP) =8B In a horrific sequence of destruction, terrorists =
crashed
two planes into the World Trade Center and the twin 110-story towers
collapsed Tuesday morning. Explosions also rocked the Pentagon and the
State Department and spread fear across the nation.

The fate of those in the twin skyscrapers was not immediately known.
Authorities had been trying to evacuate the 50,000 people who work in the
twin towers, but many were thought to be trapped.

President Bush ordered a full-scale investigation to ``hunt down the folks
who committed this act.''

One of the planes that crashed into the Trade Center was American Airlines
Flight 11, hijacked after takeoff from Boston en route to Los Angeles,
American Airlines said.

The planes blasted fiery, gaping holes in the upper floors of the twin
towers. A witness said he saw bodies falling from the twin towers and
people jumping out. About an hour later, the southern tower collapsed with
a roar a huge cloud of smoke; the other tower fell about a half-hour after
that.

``This is perhaps the most audacious terrorist attack that's ever taken
place in the world,'' said Chris Yates, an aviation expert at Jane's
Transport in London. ``It takes a logistics operation from the terror =
group
involved that is second to none. Only a very small handful of terror =
groups
is on that list. ... I would name at the top of the list Osama Bin =
Laden.''

All planes were grounded across the country by the Federal Aviation
Administration. All bridges and tunnels into Manhattan were closed down.

The twin disaster at the World Trade Center happened shortly before 9 a.m.
and then right around 9 a.m.

Heavy black smoke billowed into the sky above the gaping holes in the side
of the twin towers, one of New York City's most famous landmarks, and
debris rained down upon the street, one of the city's busiest work areas.
When the second plane hit, a fireball of flame and smoke erupted, leaving =
a
huge hole in the glass and steel tower.

John Axisa, who was getting off a PATH train to the World Trade Center,
said he saw ``bodies falling out'' of the building. He said he ran =
outside,
and watched people jump out of the first building, and then there was a
second explosion, and he felt heat on the back of neck.

WCBS-TV, citing an FBI agent, said five or six people jumped out of the
windows. People screamed every time another person leaped.

David Reck was handing out literature for a candidate for public advocate =
a
few blocks away when he saw a jet come in ``very low, and then it made a
slight twist and dove into the building.''

People ran down the stairs in panic and fled the building. Thousands of
pieces of what appeared to be office paper came drifting over Brooklyn,
about three miles away.

Within the hour, an aircraft crashed on a helicopter landing pad near the
Pentagon, a car bomb exploded outside the State Department, and the West
Wing of the White House was evacuated amid threats of terrorism. And
another explosion rocked New York about an hour after the crash.

``Today we've had a national tragedy,'' Bush said in Sarasota, Fla. ``Two
airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent =
terrorist
attack on our country.'' He said he would be returning immediately to
Washington.

Terrorist bombers struck the World Trade Center in February 1993, killing
six people and injuring more than 1,000 others.

``A second occurrence is just beyond belief,'' said Ira Furber, former
National Transportation Safety Board spokesman.

Several subway lines were immediately shut down Tuesday. Trading on Wall
Street was suspended.

``We heard a large boom and then we saw all this debris just falling,''
said Harriet Grimm, who was inside a bookstore on the World Trade Center's
first floor when the first explosion rocked the building.

``The plane was coming in low and ... it looked like it hit at a slight
angle,'' said Sean Murtagh, a CNN vice president, the network reported.

In 1945, an Army Air Corps B-25, a twin-engine bomber, crashed into the
79th floor of the Empire State Building in dense fog.

In Florida, Bush was reading to children in a classroom at 9:05 a.m. when
his chief of staff, Andrew Card, whispered into his ear. The president
briefly turned somber before he resumed reading. He addressed the tragedy
about a half-hour later.

I turned on the news when I woke up this morning. This is something I
never, ever do, but for some reason this morning I did. It was 9 a.m.
I remember Sesame Street was on PBS, and I turned the channel to one
of the networks and was immediately confronted with the image of smoke
billowing out over a great city surrounded by water, which I assumed
to be San Francisco, and I heard the newscasters talking about
“terrorism” and “plane crashes” and tried to read the scrolling
headlines that ran across the top and bottom of the screen and take it
all in. Gradually I understood that a plane – no, two planes – had
crashed into the World Trade Center in New York – this was the footage
I was seeing. It took longer to gather the rest of the information:
two other plane crashes, one at the Pentagon, one outside Pittsburgh,
a car bomb outside the State Department. It was so surreal it was hard
to believe I wasn’t watching a movie, that part in, say, a Superman
movie when the villains have succeeded in thwarting Superman and
inflicting mass destruction and there’s a cutaway to newscasters
confusedly relaying the news of some catastrophe of cartoon-like
proportions, and calling upon Superman to save the day --- only this
was much worse. There was a tone of calm shock to the whole thing that
I’d never seen before. As if no one could figure out how to express
emotion on so vast a scale. No one could register anything except
confusion. And shock.

I sat watching various news reports for the better part of an hour,
wondering what was happening in the world immediately outside and
taking in all the ancillary information – all domestic flights had
been grounded, schools were closed, also local government offices,
etc. To this point my morning had closely resembled that of countless
people just now waking up all over the country. Next came the urge to
go out into the world, to figure out what was going on, to see people
and catch the tone of the day outside. It was similar to the urge to
have some authority figure, some “Superman,” make some definite
pronouncement on the whole thing, put it all in perspective. But all
we had was our president landing mysteriously in Louisiana and making
a vow of revenge which seemed feeble and incredibly childish somehow
in the scope of things.

Anyway I had to get to my office. We were supposed to have a meeting
at 11.30 and I hadn’t gotten any word that it would be cancelled, hadn
’t yet grasped that of course it would. Sonny had my car, having spent
the night at Sasha’s, and so I got ready and rode out into the day on
my bike. I noted with some amazement that there were still cars on the
roads. Buses were still running. The traffic seemed less than usual,
though, and there were less people than usual parked at the dry docks.
When I got to work I turned on the computer and got more news off the
Internet. Salon.com, mostly, but even on ESPN they had a timeline and
stories about it. Then I checked my e-mail. Getting back to normal in
spite of it all. Stuff like that.

I talked with Diane. She had heard the news first thing this morning
when, like me, she for some reason turned on her radio. Of course she
was up much earlier, when it had just happened; she was teaching a
little while later and nobody had heard about it yet, all the reports
were completely mixed up and confused. Then I called Hilda and Bruce
and talked with Hilda and I could hear the TV in the background and
Bruce had stayed home. After that I just couldn’t sit still in my
office. I had to get out and “see.” I had heard that City Hall was
closed and thought I’d walk down there. I walked up 8th St. towards
Market, kind of in a daze. When I reached Market I found that the
Burger King on the corner of Hyde was closed (“Till noon” a sign
said), and the Library was closed (“by order of the mayor,” according
to another sign). The newspaper kiosk was open, but none of the papers
had any of the news yet – it was all still headlines about the latest
rampage killings in Sacramento two days ago, which already seemed
distant and quaint in comparison to what was on everyone’s lips.

I walked on towards City Hall. The streets all around it, Polk, Grove,
Larkin, were barricaded. Apparently the State building is adjacent to
City Hall, and that was closed, too. There were still bums out
lounging around on the lawn in the square out front and in front of
the library, though, passing cigarettes, lying down, taking their
ease. There was a group of German tourists who walked by with a map,
talking in muted tones. The only cars around were cops’. There were
three or four motorcycle cops lined up in front of the Civic
Auditorium. Then as you got closer to City Hall there were cops
patrolling on foot, yelling at whoever happened to step into the
street in front of the building to “go around the barricades.” There
was an Asian man who stood there gesturing that he just wanted to get
“over there” until finally he turned and walked back around. The
problem was that they’d barricaded such a vast area that they couldn’t
really guard it all, and the barricades and tape were stretched out in
a confusing maze so you couldn’t really tell what was off-limits and
what was just deserted.

Nevertheless I gathered that I was to walk around and so I skirted the
building and crossed Grove and headed towards Van Ness. There was a
young cop on the corner, short and thick-set, and I looked up at him
with that feeling of strange commiseration and comradery you feel when
something really terrible has happened, but all he said to me upon
catching my eye was “We need you to stay out of the street,” spoken
with a sharp snap of authority, as though I had made some move to
break through the barricade or was just shifty-looking enough to try
it. “Fine,” I said, walking on, the feeling broken, denied. So this is
how it’s going to be: We need you to stay out of the street. I had a
sinking feeling that they were saying that, or something like it, all
over the country right now. Next would come the homeless sweeps and
the random searches. Already the borders were closed. Who could say
what was happening in towns like Detroit, where there’s a heavy Arab
population. Where that “vow of revenge” Bush had made would first be
taken up and carried out, against whom.

Then from behind me I heard a trio of cops bark out: “Ma’am! Ma’am!
Get out of the street and walk around please! Ma’am!” They were
shouting at a goodlooking young woman talking on a cell phone who had
wandered out obliviously into the street in front of City Hall.
Hearing them, she gestured and turned around.

On Van Ness I saw a woman I know riding a bicycle, her face pinched in
a look of hurried anxiousness, and I thought of stopping her by
calling out “Ivy,” which was her name, but she was so preoccupied she
rode right past me on the sidewalk without looking up, and I didn’t
say anything. It was remarkable to realize there were no planes in the
air, catching the sun in the corner of your eye as they curved
eastward over the bay or roared south towards the airport to land. And
that there were no planes catching anyone’s eye anywhere in the
country.

I walked over to Raskin’s office to pick up Rova’s mail. But the
building was closed – another sign explained they’d open tomorrow. I
crossed Division to go to Rainbow Grocery and buy some things for
lunch and for dinner later. In one of the aisles a woman was
exclaiming something about the crashes to some employees, and people
stopped to listen. She was saying she’d heard how someone on one of
the planes had been in the bathroom dialing 911 on their cell phone
and telling them that the plane was going to crash. I couldn’t imagine
it, but somehow I put myself there, tried to envision myself doing
something like that. Had no idea if it was true or not, or what
possible difference it could have made. Just a sort of reflex for a
situation in which no reflexes can have any possible meaning, or
effect.

Earlier I had said to Hilda that things felt different already. I
couldn’t explain what that meant. I guess what I was feeling was this
vague rage, this impotence, this odd remoteness from what had happened
which was nevertheless erased by the very enormity of it. The World
Trade Center towers had been there this morning; now, they were gone.
Somehow that was more remarkable, more demoralizing than the abstract
notion of all the people that had been killed. There was yet no number
for that, no body count, though they had estimated it was in the
thousands. In some news story or another they had reported that
Palestinians were passing out candy on the streets and celebrating in
the Middle East. You could picture that. And you could picture the
towers going down, because you had seen footage of the explosions,
even the highlighted shape of the second plane crashing into the
second tower fifteen minutes after the first one, the cameras already
trained on its smoking wreckage. But you couldn’t, just yet, wrap your
mind around the skyline of Manhattan without those towers.

What I can't describe is how beautiful the day is in New York; clear skies, visibility all the way to the other side of wherever you think you are looking.

Or looking away.

After the long and strange Odyssey back from LaGuardia airport this morning, I went to a jammed local upper west side coffee shop. A family was eating, deciding, loudly, whether to get the chicken or tuna salad; the mother expressed great disappointment that there was no skim milk. The coffee shop was packed and the mother said, "Well, it's OK, at least we're not in a rush right now and after all the restaurant probably has more people now than they are used to handling."

Outside, two guys with work boots and cell phones strapped to their waist yelled toward the coffee shop, "I can't believe these fucking people are sitting in a cafe when the city is being blown up."

I can't imagine Manhattan without those two towers looming over the south end. As I was walking across the 59th Street bridge I couldn't stop thinking of that Simon and Garfunkel song named after the bridge, "Feeling Groovy" ("Life I love you ... all is ... ").

It was hard not to feel like it was a movie and one with an unbelievable plot at that. All the airports closed; the Pentagon bombed; four commercial jets hijacked on suicide missions. The Queensborough bridge was overflowing with people streaming out of Manhattan, a line as wide as the bridge and as long as Manhattan itself. If you looked out to the left, there was a big plume of smoke over downtown Manhattan. You couldn't see that the Towers were not there.

And it didn't seem possible that this had happened either.

Even with all the people streaming out, and the small clutch of us walking back to the island.

The FDR drive below us was empty, with just the occasional emergency vehicle. The UN Secretariat building looked naked, vulnerable. Why wouldn't a plane smash into that while we walked across the East River.

The skies unnaturally clear of airplanes, though every once in a while you hear the ominous swoop of a jet overhead, presumably military. Once in Manhattan, the entrance to the bridge was mobbed. But walking west, people were quietly hanging out on street corners. Most of the avenues were cleared of traffic, except for the sirens or an ambulance or fire truck racing downtown.

While the phones are not working very well (so much of NYC communication is streamed through the World Trade Center), the email is working fine. There are notes of disbelief and worry from people from all over, especially Europe. My friends Misko and Dubravka from Beograd write and I remember their emails when their city was under fire. And various friends we just saw on our recent trip.

As I was walking home, about half a mile from our apartment, I stop by the storefront hair salon of Andrew, who lives upstairs in our building. I had been trying for a couple of hours to get Susan on the phone, to see if she had picked up Felix at school. But neither the cell or land phones were working. When I saw Andrew he said Susan and Felix had just walked by and were heading home. He said he was going to stay open just because he thought people would want to have him there, standing in front of his shop.

At about 6, Felix, Susan and I walked down to the Hudson. I wanted to see New Jersey, to see the George Washington Bridge. The sun gleamed on the water. The bridge was calm. Folks were bicycling and rollerblading. The scene was almost serene; just five miles from the Trade Center.

Uncanny is the word.

What I can't describe is the reality; the panic; the horror.

I keep turning on the TV to hear what I can't take in and what I already know. Over and over. I don't find the coverage comforting but addictive.

This could not have happened. This hasn't happened.

This is happening.

It's 8:23 in New York.

what will be the response?  what does it mean to say we'll get those who
perpetrated this act of horror and "those who harbor them?" will democracy
at home suffer collateral damage?

Charles. Etal. Its strange and I've only been to NY once (1993, ironically
as it happens) when I went up the South Tower. It seems surreal even here in
New Zealand. I also was watching the videos over and over: it does become
addictive. I try to imagine a human plunging into that building. At the
moment even I'm emotional. had some symapthy for the Palestinian cause, I
tried to understand the Teleban: but I think the US has to face it. It (and
we in the West) ARE and or  IS under a real threat to democracy: to human
civilisation as a against the barabric bastards "out there". I'm right
behind the US whatever they do.
 Bush is right in this case. Democracy, what little we have, is being
attacked. I can understand now how the Israelis feel surrounded by nut
cases.And although I'm not a great supporter of Israel (I know there were
injustices by themm and they have been agressive at times) but it seemed to
me that the US and Israel were probing toward a negotiated settlement. That
wont happen with these guys:they are sub- human robotic scum: they are
beyond the law and they and theirs should be burnt. BURNT!! Richard.

The first we knew of it this morning was when Ana Doina called from
New Jersey and asked Lynda if we were okay. Lynda (I think--I was
upstairs taking a shower, getting ready to go off to Newark for my
two Tuesday classes) said, "Sure, why? Who is this?" Ana said, "Look
out your window." And Lynda looked out and saw great billows of
smoke rising into the sky. Our windows on that side of the livingroom
look south, but the WLC is blocked from view by an arm of the building
we live in. At night, when we're going to bed we can see the skinny
communications tower at the very top of  . . . I guess it's WTC1. Just
that, and its warning lights--lights intended to warn off aircraft, strange
to say.

Most of the day, we sat transfixed by the images on the TV screen, one
or the other of us jumping up every now and then to check the billowing
mountain of smoke downtown. The first phone call was from Lynda's
mother in Florida.

It wasn't until a bit after 5:00 in the afternoon that we ventured out of
the apartment, first to go up to the roof about five floors above us. Waiting
for the elevator, we checked out the large window near it that until today
had a clear view of the WTC in all but the foggiest, cloudiest weathers. Just
smoke, today.A handful of people were up there, looking off to the south,
where the smoke was still rising, and where a sudden rush of stronger billowing
may have betokened the collapse of Bldg. 7, which occurred, I think, about
that time.

It was warm and sunny on the roof. The late-afternoon sun was
sparkling on the Hudson, just across West Street from our building.
One of those gorgeous late-summer evenings--except for the
large smudge of smoke. I remembered living as a kid in an apartment
house at 7th Ave. and 14th St., where for a few weeks during WW2
we could lean out the dining room window and see the black smoke
rising from the French liner Normandy burning where it lay on its
side at its dock at the foot of 14th St.

There aren't many docks along the Hudson anymore. The riverfront
is becoming people space, with miles of pathways for joggers, and
skaters, and bikers. And there were a lot of them down there as
we looked down from the roof. Dog-walkers too. Yes, the dogs
still need to be walked here in New York.

So, we decided to go down and walk for a bit ourselves. West Street
is usually crowded with traffic, especially on weekdays, early in the
morning and in the late afternoon. It's what the West-side Highway
becomes here downtown. Today it was free of trucks, cars, taxis.
Police cars and emergency vehicles were almost all we saw. But in
the park and along the pathways used by joggers and bikers--lots
of folks walking along, riding along, just standing or sitting staring
south. Some people heading uptown, a couple with face masks
hanging around their necks.

We got down to Pier 40, just below Morton Street before coming
to the police barrier, where two officers were turning people back.
A block or two below, lots of emergency vehicles, ambulances,
flashing lights, and beyond them the mountain of smoke where the
WTC had been until this morning. Against the darkness of the
smoke the white and green tower of the Woolworth Building
seemed brighter and more elaborate than ever.

Coming back up, we walked along Hudson Street (what 8th Ave.
becomes south of Bleecker Street) and the scene was really
strange--almost no traffic, some of the sidestreets barricaded
(to secure the precinct house on W. 10th Street, a patrolman
told me). Shops (almost all dark, with their security gates down
and locked) were closed, as were most restaurants (all but a
couple Chinese places). Even the White Horse was closed.

At one point, a convoy of twenty ambulances went by, speeding
north, with wailing police cars fore and aft. The ambulances
I saw were from places as far away as Cherry Hill, New Jersey,
just east of Philly. When emergency vehicles weren't passing by,
the street had that eerie Sunday-morning sort of stillness to it.
What wasn't there was what we saw--the taxis, the trucks, the
twin towers (margarine sticks, I've enjoyed calling them) of the
WTC, the business as usual.

When we got home there were more phone calls and more TV.
We learned from Timo (Lynda's son in Chicago) that Zach and
Maggie had been heading this morning for Century 21, a big
store right across the street from the WTC, to get Maggie a
pair of shoes. Later, Zach called again and told us that he and
Maggie had picked up people walking back into Brooklyn
from Manhattan and ferried them home in their car. Folks on
TV started wondering whether there wasn't some failure of
intelligence involved in all this. Duh, double-duh.

My "little" brother Jimmy is an ironworker in NYC.  He works for the company
that built the WTC.  After the '93 bombing he helped make repairs.  Since
yesterday he's been running a crew to help clear debris from the bombsite.
He was a couple hundred yards away when Bldg 7 fell.  He said he was standing
in 3 feet of ash at the time.

>From the War Resisters League:
I'm writing this from home - the WRL office email is down, but I was
present when this statement was drafted and said I'd take the text home to
transmit at once. David McReynolds


>>>>>>>>>>>>>

As we write, Manhattan feels under siege, with all bridges, tunnels, and
subways closed, and tens of thousands of people walking slowly north
from Lower Manhattan. As we sit in our offices here at War Resisters League,
our most immediate thoughts are of the hundreds, if not thousands, of New
Yorkers who have lost their lives in the collapse of the World Trade Center.
The day is clear, the sky is blue, but vast clouds billow over the ruins
where so many have died, including a great many rescue workers who were
there when the final collapse occurred.

Of course we know our friends and co-workers in Washington D.C. have similar
thoughts about the ordinary people who have been trapped in the parts of
the Pentagon which were also struck by a jet. And we think of the innocent
passengers on the hi-jacked jets who were carried to their doom on this
day.

We do not know at this time from what source the attack came. We do know
that Yasser Arafat has condemned the bombing. We hesitate to make an
extended analysis until more information is available but some things are
clear. For the Bush Administration to talk of spending hundreds of billions
on Star Wars is clearly the sham [= farsa] it was from the beginning, when
terrorism can so easily strike through more routine means.

We urge Congress and George Bush that whatever response or policy the U.S.
develops it will be clear that this nation will no longer target civilians,
or accept any policy by any nation which targets civilians. This would mean
an end to the sanctions against Iraq, which have caused the deaths of
hundreds of thousands of civilians. It would mean not only a condemnation of
terrorism by Palestinians but also the policy of assassination against the
Palestinian leadership by Israel, and the ruthless repression of the
Palestinian population and the continuing occupation by Israel of the West
Bank and Gaza.

The policies of militarism pursued by the United States have resulted in
millions of deaths, from the historic tragedy of the Indochina war,
through the funding of death squads in Central America and Colombia, to the
sanctions and air strikes against Iraq. This nation is the largest supplier
of "conventional weapons" in the world - and those weapons fuel the starkest
kind of terrorism from Indonesia to Africa. The early policy of support for
armed resistance in Afghanistan resulted in the victory of the Taliban - and
the creation of Osama Bin Laden.

Other nations have also engaged in these policies. We have, in years past,
condemned the actions of the Russian government in areas such as Chechnya,
the violence on both sides in the Middle East, and in the Balkans. But our
nation must take responsibility for its own actions. Up until now we have
felt safe within our borders. To wake on a clear cool day to find our
largest city under siege reminds us that in a violent world, none are safe.

Let us seek an end of the militarism which has characterized this nation for
decades. Let us seek a world in which security is gained through
disarmament, international cooperation, and social justice - not through
escalation and retaliation. We condemn without reservation attacks such as
those which occurred today, which strike at thousands of civilians - may
these profound tragedies remind us of the impact U.S. policies have had on
other civilians in other lands. We are particularly aware of the fear which
many people of Middle Eastern descent, living in this country, may feel at
this time and urge special consideration for this community.

We are one world. We shall live in a state of fear and terror or we shall
move toward a future in which we seek peaceful alternatives to conflict and
a more just distribution of the world's resources. As we mourn the many
lives lost, our hearts call out for reconciliation, not revenge.

This is not an official statement of the War Resisters League but was
drafted immediately after the tragic events occurred. Signed and issued by
the staff and Executive Committee of War Resisters League in the national
office, September 11, 2001.

is Surrealism?" (works of Breton, ed. and intor by Franklin Rosemant) is

No human, no matter how twisted, angry, despicable, or wrong-doing is
sub-human. No one deserves to be burnt. No one. Until we stop vengeful
lashing out, which is what yesterday's actions most likely were, we will
*all* continue to burn, at random. I am not being hopelessly idealistic when
I say this, but painfully realistic. I, as a U.S. taxpayer, feel partly
responsible for the atrocities my government has committed which may have
led to this most recent atrocity. I felt the same way when we last bombed
Baghdad and, earlier, during the Los Angeles riots. No one is to be excused
yet what good does it do to blame? Original sin is not a useful concept.

The real issue for me is what, as a poet, as a human, am I going to do now?

Read: "American cowboys have reaped the fruit of their own violence."

This is a cheap and simplistic shot to send out the day after such a
tragedy.

On the other hand, I have deeply appreciated the stories posted by Charles &
others.  I still have "feelin grovy" running through my head.  St. Louis is
business-as-usual, but everyone is kind of in a daze.

My heart goes out to everyone, and I hope we can soon
here reports from our NYC poetics friends to make sure
everyone is ok.  I am thinking of you.

A former New Yorker, I miss my city very much, and
mourn for it.  One thing I keep thinking of: when I
lived in NYC, I dated a guy who once knew a British
mother and her young son who were visiting the States.
 When in Manhattan, the little boy wandered around in
a daze, staring downtown and skyward, and say in a
hushed tone, "Look, Mum.  The twins are so beautiful
tonight."

The poor beautiful twins and all their occupants.  My
grandfather worked in Tower 2 for many, many years
under Attorney General Bob Abrams, and we used to
visit him there.  An uncle and cousin both work in the
WFC complex but neither, thank goodness, were at work
yesterday.

Love to everyone.

Thank you for forwarding this message to the list.  In times like this it is
important to remember that, however unthinkable this tragedy is, however
much grief it has caused, violence only begets more violence.  If you don't
believe me, just look at the Middle East or Northern Ireland.  Also, it is
important to be reminded that for too long the United States has been
complicit in violence abroad in pursuit of "our national interests."  (bin
Laden, to give one example, apparently got his start as a terrorist working
*with the CIA* in the jihad against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the
80s). That does not IN ANY WAY make yesterday's attack conscionable, but it
does provide a context in which we can begin to understand it-- and it
should at the very least give us pause before we enter into another cycle of
retaliation and victimization.

I'd like to offer my condolence to anyone on the list who has personally
been affected by this tragedy.  Thanks to Charles for his post.  Anyone else
out there on the list who is in New York and alright, please send word let
us know.  I think we all will be relieved to hear from you.

Peace,

Mark DuCharme

all of a sudden tonight the smell of burning plastic pervades our apartment, making eyes smart. is it something in the building?  no, a neighbor explains, that's the smell coming from downtown.

*

Mei-mei Berssenbrugge calls; she's OK, hanging in a couple of blocks from the epicenter. I say to her I have trouble imagining what  is going on. She says, oh you can imagine it all right, from the movies. You just can't conceive it.

*

I see Andrew, the hairdresser, in the lobby of our building. He says things were on and off today; several appointments were no shows.

"Maybe they're not coming back."

*

A friend in Berkeley asks me how things are going and I write back. The reply is immediate: "automated response". It is entirely blank.

*
We drop Felix off at a friend's across from his school on 77th and Amsterdam. The fire station on the block, which we pass every day, is empty, with piles of flowers in the doorway. A wave of terror sweeps over us; after all, 200 to 300 firefighters have died. Later in the afternoon, I come to pick Felix up an there are ten or twelve firemen in front of the firehouse, calmly, so it seems, washing the two fire trucks parked in the middle of the street. It's a relief to see them.

Then we hear that nine of the thirty men stationed there perished.

*

The most frequent analogy is to Pearl Harbor, though the London blitz might also be mentioned. I keep thinking of something else, not something that happened but something I expected to happen. In the 50s, we were trained to prepare for a nuclear attack on Manhattan. In elementary school we had drills in which we were marched into the halls and all the window and door glass was covered with wood. The events of yesterday seem to finally play out that fear.

*
A psychologist friend is on extra duty though the weekend. Those at the edge are going over it.

"I may be paranoid but there really are people out to get me."

*

"It's a bit ominous," a friend writes,  "the way the politicos are speaking about "talking with one voice."

-- I am just trying to get by talking with no voice.

*

Many of the officials on TV say we will come out of all this stronger.

But it won't be the same we.

Stronger or not.

*

Jerry and Diane Rothenberg come by. We finish off the bottle of "reserve" Stolly I bought just a few weeks ago at the Moscow airport "duty free".

*
for Patrick

give nothing evil to oppose
and it will crash the program

*

the image is greater than the reality

the image can't approach the reality

the reality has no image

our eyes are burning

the severity of what's just happened---where the casualties may
approach e.g. all u.s. casualities in eight years of viet nam---moves
me to silence... but for some reason, i feel i must hazard a few
thoughts here...

do i think the u.s. govt's (among others nations')
ideological-political stance is partly responsible for what
happened?... of course...

do i think "we" (preferably the united nations) must bring to justice
whoever did this?... of course...

do i think doing so might require armed intervention into another
soveriegn state?... yes...

do i think this might pose a risk to civilian populations? (as the
military calls them)... yes...

do i think this a risk worth taking?... yes, but only after all
efforts at diplomacy fail (e.g., "please turn over said persons"),
and only with zero civilian casualities as the m.o...

do i think this may be a more messy, a more compromised situation
than i suggest?... yes...

do i think the sensibility "we" require now (on the part of our govt
officials e.g.) is the same as the sensibility "we" req'd the day
before yesterday?... sad to say, no...

do i think the sensibility "we" require now (etc.) is the same as the
sensibility "we" may require after "we" bring said persons to
justice?... i hope not...

i'm pretty sure what i'm suggesting here won't rest well with all of
my more pacifist (?) brothers & sisters... but i really don't find it
remotely plausible that the u.s., and for that matter the rest of the
world, turn its back on what just happened, pretend that "we" can all
just get along or some such, that acting w/o a concerted national,
and better, international response (as in, above, "bring to justice")
will make the world a more peaceful place... this isn't the world
we're living in at the moment, even if it's the world we would hope
to live in... and behaving prematurely in this regard strikes me as
just so much wishful thinking, and potentially damaging wishful
thinking, at that...

and hey, just to be clear, i'm a wishful thinker mself, so i can
relate... more than anything else, my thoughts are with the
victims... and i know this means, to some degree, all of us,
everywhere---

peace,

joe

Firstly my sympathies and support from the UK to everyone there in the
US who is having to deal with the events of yesterday, the horrendous
loss of life, the pain of its aftermath - and also to support the
sentiments already being voiced below. The politicians response of a
'war on terrorism' is disastrously predictable; the big daddy version of
the proven failure that is the war on drugs - no need to be specific
about who's gonna die, where, or for how long - the perfect all-over
legitimising cover for all future acts of the kind of violence that has
contributed to the violence of yesterday - and the future is going to be
a long time because how can you 'root out evil completely' as Blair has
now expressed with characteristic missionary zeal - saying that means
you'll always find it somewhere - the coerciveness of Bush's speech is
obvious to many I'm sure - claiming anyone who 'loves freedom', or
'civilisation', is therefore 100% behind him - the chillingly deceptive
banality of his 'good vs evil' - his resusitation of the ol' beacon on a
hill, a light to all nations fiction - his talk of 'democracy' after
Florida....

and of course, the permission he now feels he has been given to speak
like this perversely could not have come at a better time for him, with
the world on the brink of a recession that will prove the lie of
neoliberal economics, the opportunity it provides for the US to re-take
centre stage and so end its perception by many as dangerously dismissive
of world problems since the walkouts in Durban and Bonn, and its
eagerness to dismiss the ABM treaty, and with huge gains having been
made toward global reconciliation in the last two years, based upon
reciprocal sensitivity to the wide range of social, cultural, economic
and ecological necessities being faced by myriad different groups of
people - more now is understood about the need for fully workable
grassroots democratic participation (as can be found in Porte Allegre),
for ecological sustainability, recognition of fundamental human rights
linked to the practicalities of clean water, a regular food supply,
shelter, the need for reparations for our racist past  - and now more
than ever, global anti-market corporatisation stands exposed for the
destructive force it is. For the rich North, led by the US, with its UK
attack-dog yapping right behind, to lurch now into an accelerated cycle
of multi-state sponsored terrorism that will inevitably only bring
further versions of what happened yesterday, fails us all -

as outlined below, the horrendous nature of the attack should be the
very thing that focuses all efforts on finding a peaceful solution to
Israel-Palestine, to ending Iraqi sanctions, to negotiating peace in
Afghanistan, and also, keeps our eyes firmly on the alternatives already
being discussed prior to yesterday, an example being:-

If that were the message, I agree, it would be awful.
But I can't see that in its condemnation of all acts
of violence, and in its expressions of sympathy for
the victims.  Rather, it provides a necessary
corrective for the reigning interpretation of this
terrible tragedy:  the demand for the harshest of
reprisals, innocents be damned, and for the sacrifice
of liberty for security.  Both demands are easy to
understand, even to sympathize with, but devastatingly
wrong.

If, on the other hand, the event could draw out a
renewal of citizenship, counterpart not to the demonic
nationalism slavering for blood, but to the
innumerable acts of courage, kindness, and generosity
we hear coming out of New York and Washington, a
citizenship that realizes past American collusion with
tyranny brings a terrible cost with it and that works
to realize America as a genuine force for liberty and
justice for the world's dispossessed, only then, it
seems to me, will we really honor the memory of those
who lost their lives.  Unrealistic?  Sure, but I think
that down the other path we can only find escalation,
further horror, and the inevitable dimunition of our
freedom.

I think you'll like this, too, Maria.  It is similar to the War Resister's
League post sent by hassen.

http://commondreams.org/views01/0912-02.htm

Another voice of reason in this wilderness of men pounding death marches on
the wood of dead trees.

It does appear that some of the bloodlust has calmed a bit on the
television.  Despite, I might add, the hideous opportunism of America's
Congress, each stepping forward to show his or her "unity" and share their
desires for revenge.  Perhaps there is reason for hope.

Props to the New York City Fire Department.  They were truly heroic and
continue their heroic actions.

O dark dark dark. They all go into the dark,
The vacant interstellar spaces, the vacant into the vacant,
The captains, merchant bankers, eminent men of letters,
The generous patrons of art, the statesmen and the rulers,
Distinguished civil servants, chairmen of many committees,
Industrial lords and petty contractors, all go into the dark,
And dark the Sun and Moon, and the Almanach de Gotha
And the Stock Exchange Gazette, the Directory of Directors,
And cold the sense and lost the motive of action.
And we all go with them, into the silent funeral,
Nobody's funeral, for there is no one to bury.
I said to my soul, be still, and let the dark come upon you
Which shall be the darkness of God. As, in a theatre,
The lights are extinguished, for the scene to be changed
With a hollow rumble of wings, with a movement of darkness on darkness,
And we know that the hills and the trees, the distant panorama
And the bold imposing facade are all being rolled away=8B
Or as, when an underground train, in the tube, stops too long between
stations
And the conversation rises and slowly fades into silence
And you see behind every face the mental emptiness deepen
Leaving only the growing terror of nothing to think about;
Or when, under ether, the mind is conscious but conscious of nothing=8B
I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope
For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love,
For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith
But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.
Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:
So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.
Whisper of running streams, and winter lightning.
The wild thyme unseen and the wild strawberry,
The laughter in the garden, echoed ecstasy
Not lost, but requiring, pointing to the agony
Of death and birth.

Yes we are OK
Very shaken but OK

I was trapped on Staten Island all day yesterday-
I on the 8:30 ferry over to teach at St. John's when the first plane hit-
didn't see it cuz I was on the front of the ferry
though my friend Patrizia did who I met later in the day-
(she was crying cuz her husband was on Grand Street near Centre and no one
could use phones -) she said it made no sound and just looked like a little
flash of light then a fire at the very top

I heard about it on the radio in the gypsy cab to school -
-thought it must be an accident
 I started to teach my 9:00 class
- didn't know the size of it all-
- couldn't imagine =8B

then Karen Weiser came on the last ferry from Manhattan-
(the 9:00 or 9:30 was delayed) she made it out by 10?
 but then the second tower collapsed
she said lights went out and thousands of screaming people rushed to the
boat covered with ash put on life vests

After not going to the mass on the green
but going to student center with students stuck there from Jersey &
Broorklyn Patrizia Karren and went to stay at Chris Funkhauser  & Amy
Hufnagel's & their 2 yr old daughter Stella's welcoming home
2 other women on island for meeting for NY Women's Foundation
We walked down to ater to watch the buildings burn - the unreal gap
Chris say #7 Wall Street collpase earlier through binoculars
We ate together shared fellowship

Tony finally got through  on re-opened ferry and came over late
Tony and his sister had gone down there to get his niece out of school righ=
t
next to WTC to find she had been evacuated already -
even thought they had called and they had said everything was OK and school
was still on-
found her later at other school near CHristopher Street - were down there
when 2nd tower collapsed
too close for comfort


 we got a ride back home to Brooklyn on reopened BQE (ferries are closed
again) just now


Saw the changed skyline smoking from the island
and closer and closer up the BQE

totally devastated mass grave there now

from Bard faculty list:



Dear Friends,
Thank you so much for the outpouring of concern for my well-being and
that of fellow New Yorkers and Americans after the attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon yesterday. I am finally able to get online
and have a few minutes to write. (I notice that sitting down, taking
time out to write this, putting it into a flow of coherent words, is
therapeutic.) I have answered as many of you individually as possible,
but the messages don't stop, so here a broadcast. I am safe, but my
sense of security is shattered. I was sitting on the Promenade at 850am
when the first plane hit the World Trade Center. There was smoke and
millions of tiny glitters in the air, which turned out to be white
papers -- documents flying across the East River. One of them was a
FedEx envelope with a contract that someone was presumably signing when
the first plane hit. At 915 I saw another plane fly in from Staten
Island, it flew incredibly low and accelerated, so close to me that I
thought it was flying up the East River -- but it ducked behind a
highrise on Manhattan and tilted itself like a fighter plane, and a
moment later disappeared into the South Tower. By this time there were a
dozen people watching, speechless. We stood there immobilized as I
called as many people as possible on my cell phone (but got through only
to my parents in Australia). Then I saw one tower collapse, then the
other, and I sat down and wept. Since then we have been tracking down
friends and colleagues (several client companies of ours had leased
multiple floors in the WTC; an intern's company had 1,000 people on 6
floors, and they still have 50 people unaccounted for; I know people at
Morgan Stanley which leased 25 floors; a friend of mine from Fire Island
worked there and is still missing). I went to donate blood, called
people, comforted strangers as best I could, listened to the radio on my
earpiece, was interviewed as an eyewitness by Swiss national primetime
TV news. It was hard to breathe.

We are grieving for the firefighters and police officers and military
personnel and civilians who died, and for their families. We are trying
to save people who are calling on their cell phones from underneath the
rubble. At the same time, we are inspired by the heroism and leadership
of ordinary people going beyond themselves. We are heartened by the
response from around the world (e.g. the stopping of all traffic and
minute of silence in my hometown Basel, where as many people live as
frequent the World Trade Center every day). The unity and camaraderie
and human spirit are palpable and will never be forgotten. And now we
need to look at what is next. Our gravest fear is war. I am encouraged
by secretary of state Colin Powell's assurance early this morning that
the US is working for a multilateral response by the international
community, rather than taking unilateral action. (In my opinion, while
these terrorist attacks on civilians are inexcusable, the
US has isolated itself dangerously in recent months, and US
unilateralism must stop.)

Thank you for reading this lengthy email. There is so much more to say,
but I must go back to Lawrence Street to donate blood.
Love and strength,

It's so ironic today's weather. The beauty of the day is underlined by the
extreme silence of this place. Upon getting to work yesterday morning I was
informed that a small Cesna had crashed into the WTC, but then we heard a
second plane had gone into the second tower. I was in Tower 2 on the 55th
floor during the 1993 bombing, and I remember breaking the windows and
trying to stay calm. It was so frightening, but what was is more
frightening to me today is the revenge mongers. Certainly, US must
retaliate, but for people to think that the actions that we received
yesterday were unprovoked is short-sighted at the least. Our chickens are
coming home to roost, and we must realize this despite the grief and sorrow
that we feel today. US foreign has not been kind. This time, however, we
are feeling the brunt of the actions. My fiancee and I walked down the
street today here in Astoria, Queens, and there was this pudgy little boy
sitting on the top stoop of his house crying in silence. The boy's tears
collecting in his eyes and the look of fear in his face shattered me today.
The sun sets on a very beautiful and haunting day today here in New York.

My very best to all of you.

Ah, well, the ayes have it. I semi-retract my statement about the cheapness
of the message from WRL, though I still think it's simplistic to imagine
lifting (or having lifted) sanctions against Iraq.  And I'll add that I
think that the ill-timed, medicine-factory-bombing approach of previous
regimes has exacerbated the problem as much as our violent legacy itself.

However, this article convinced me of what I already knew -- that the U.S.
has "lived by the sword" in many ways, and we should not be surprised if we
are checked violently for that.

The Unknown Enemy
September 11, 2001

by Joe Sobran

     It was predictable. For years I've been writing that
the U.S. Government has been making more enemies than
Americans really need, all over the globe, and that one
of these days some of them would have a nasty surprise
for us.

     In fact it nearly happened a few years ago, when
Islamic radicals tried to blow up the World Trade Center.
But of course they made a botch of it and got caught.

     This time, though, someone pulled off what must have
been an extremely cunning conspiracy, a criminal feat for
the ages. They managed to execute a secret plan calling
for four simultaneous hijackings of airplanes. Those who
committed these coordinated deeds -- in spite of all
security measures -- also had the determination to die in
hitting their targets.

     This wasn't "terrorism." This was war. It wasn't a
random attempt to scare people with an arbitrary
atrocity, like the bombing of a pizza joint; it was a
serious attempt to kill as many people and do as much
material damage as possible at two strategic targets, the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

     But, as I write, hours after the attacks, we don't
know who is at war with us. We may never know. Who has
reason to hate this country? Only a few hundred million
people -- Arabs, Muslims, Serbs, and numerous others
whose countries have been hit by U.S. bombers.

     Imagine hating a country so much that you were
willing to cross an ocean and carry out an elaborate
revenge against its people, killing yourself in the
process. This is something far more than the sort of
ideological anti-Americanism that leads student mobs to
throw stones at U.S. embassies abroad; that's kid stuff.
This is an obsessive, fanatical, soul-consuming hatred.

     Foreigners aren't quite real to Americans, and most
Americans are unaware of how profoundly their government
antagonizes much of the human race. We are easy-going
people who generally have no idea how bullying we seem to
foreigners. Until now, we have had no experience of what
the U.S. Government has so often inflicted on others.
Now, at least, we have an inkling of what it feels like.

     Government spokesmen have responded with their usual
cant of "cowardly attacks" by "terrorists" who "hate
democracy and freedom." Rubbish. A fanatic who is ready
to die is the opposite of a coward, and nobody can "hate"
such abstractions as "democracy and freedom" with that
kind of intensity.

     It's dangerous to belittle your enemy, especially
when his courage and cunning have already proved as
formidable as his hatred and cruelty. The first question
you should ask about your enemy is why he is your enemy
in the first place.

     You may be deluding and flattering yourself if you
assume he hates you for your virtues. But our "leaders"
assure us that our enemies are unnaturally evil people
who hate us only because we are so wonderful. And they
manage to utter this nonsense with an air of tough-minded
realism.

     True realism, on the other hand, doesn't mean
blaming Americans for bringing these horrifying and truly
evil acts on themselves. It does mean trying to imagine
alien perspectives from which our government's conduct
might appear so intolerable that some people might be
driven to take atrocious revenge.

     "To understand all is to forgive all," says the
French aphorism. Not true. But understanding all can at
least teach you how to avoid making enemies, and avoiding
making enemies is the best defense -- better than a $300
billion "defense" budget that didn't defend the World
Trade Center.

     The great director Jean Renoir was once asked why
there were no villains in his films. He answered simply:
"Everyone has his reasons." Your bitterest enemy may have
his reasons for hating your guts. You may not think they
are good or sufficient reasons, but you'd better take
them into account. If he has any brains, he may find a
way to hurt you.

     The United States is now a global empire that wants
to think of itself as a universal benefactor, and is
nonplussed when foreigners don't see it that way. None of
the earlier empires of this world, as far as I know,
shared this delusion; the Romans, the Mongols, the
British, the Russians and Soviets didn't expect to rule
and to be loved at the same time. Why do we?

I used to work for a small humanitarian organization, Grassroots
International, and we worked with the institutions of the PLO; we called
them partners. One of them was the Gaza Community Mental Health Center.
What follows are remarks from Dr. Eyad Serraj, the center's director.

Yrs.
Anastasios Kozaitis

---------------------------------
Horror in the U.S.

The world today is not the same as it was.

The incredible and horrific terrorist attacks on American targets in New
York and Washington DC have shocked the world and alarmed people every where.

We Condemn the killing of innocent people in America and elsewhere.

Attacks on civilians, threats against life and murder are crimes against
humanity. We, secure in our belief in the sanctity of life, are abhorred by
such acts of violence. Arabs and Palestinians who continue to suffer the
complex tragedy since their uprooting, and the Israeli state sponsored
violence against them should only stand firm against terror even with the
knowledge of the long standing support for Israel by successive American
governments. We absolutely reject the logic that horror and murder is the
only way to change policies.

The anger due to American policies in the world and in our region should
not blind us to see that those who were killed and wounded in these
horrific carnages are our brothers and sisters in humanity. Their murder
can never be justified. For them and their families we extend our respect,
and sympathy.

Dr. Eyad El Sarraj

Actually, my last email was to see what response would come. I think in fact
the attack could even have been organised by the CIA and if eg it had been
the time of the Gulf War I would have rejoiced. In some ways looking at the
situation now one can see it as (on one level) a real attack on Capitalism)
and only Suddham Hussein has had the courage to say and some are thinking
privately) that (in a complex way) the US military-political-state complex
are reaping what they sow...if one was a member of a revolutionary group
this would seem like a wonderful thing.
  I think that seeing those towers exploding over and over is a beautiful
thing.
  I got carried away for a while but then I started thinking more calmly:
what a better oppoprtunity for the troubled US Bush administration! What
would happen...there is no response by the US that will achive anything
except more deaths: terrrorism is a great weapon to hold such nations as the
US or any other super power in check.  It is a great revolutionary strike.
  But I am still moved by he plight of the people in the US: however one has
to remember the humiliations and suffering incurred for decades by the
Palestinians and others even if some of them (the minority) are extreme
religious fundamentalists....of which there are a number iun the US of
whatever ilk. This shows that capitalism is vulnerable: potentially the
revolutin can succeed.
  I didnt see hardly one person who wasnt in a suit or a tie and the
military are the same hawks that were active in 1990, Bush is the son of
Bush: as in the Iraq war. The American politoical miltary complex are
beating a drum: they should be asking, or the people in the West should be
asking: why are we hated? Why was the symbol of capitalism attacked? It is
because capitalism is being attacked.
   AS Mao Tse Tung said: the imperialists lift arock only to drop it on
their own heads until their doom.  The onlyereason gadaffi etc are backing
away is because..well its part of the general strategy. Its the intelligent
thing to do. It leaves the US with NO actual single enenmy or nation much as
Powell wants to go in "boots and all"....and Bush probably wants some glory.
    Beautiful towers:

           Unreal city

            What is that sound high in the air
         Murmer of maternal lamentation
         Who are those hooded hords swarming
         Over the endless plains, stumbling incracked earth
         Ringed by the flat horizon only
         What is the cuty over the nountains
         Cracks and reforms in the violet air
         Falling towers
         Jeruslalem Athens Alexandria
         Vienna New York
         Unreal

Is seeing this as beautiful in a strange way different from Genet's vision
in "The Miracle of the Rose"?

If you are opposed to capitalism you have to go "the whole hog" and see this
as like T S Eliots Towers in the Wasteland or be like Genet in"The Miracle
of the Rose"...... it was a brilliant strike by anti capitalist forces for
whatever reason. Richard.

Fear & Loathing in America
By Hunter S. Thompson
Page 2 columnist

http://espn.go.com/page2/s/thompson/010912.html


   It was just after dawn in Woody Creek, Colo., when the first plane hit
the World Trade Center in New York City on Tuesday morning, and as usual I
was writing about sports. But not for long. Football suddenly seemed
irrelevant, compared to the scenes of destruction and utter devastation
coming out of New York on TV.

Even ESPN was broadcasting war news. It was the worst disaster in the
history of the United States, including Pearl Harbor, the San Francisco
earthquake and probably the Battle of Antietam in 1862, when 23,000 were
slaughtered in one day.

The Battle of the World Trade Center lasted about 99 minutes and cost 20,000
lives in two hours (according to unofficial estimates as of midnight
Tuesday). The final numbers, including those from the supposedly impregnable
Pentagon, across the Potomac River from Washington, likely will be higher.
Anything that kills 300 trained firefighters in two hours is a world-class
disaster.

And it was not even Bombs that caused this massive damage. No nuclear
missiles were launched from any foreign soil, no enemy bombers flew over New
York and Washington to rain death on innocent Americans. No. It was four
commercial jetliners.

They were the first flights of the day from American and United Airlines,
piloted by skilled and loyal U.S. citizens, and there was nothing suspicious
about them when they took off from Newark, N.J., and Dulles in D.C. and
Logan in Boston on routine cross-country flights to the West Coast with
fully-loaded fuel tanks -- which would soon explode on impact and utterly
destroy the world-famous Twin Towers of downtown Manhattan's World Trade
Center. Boom! Boom! Just like that.

The towers are gone now, reduced to bloody rubble, along with all hopes for
Peace in Our Time, in the United States or any other country. Make no
mistake about it: We are At War now -- with somebody -- and we will stay At
War with that mysterious Enemy for the rest of our lives.

It will be a Religious War, a sort of Christian Jihad, fueled by religious
hatred and led by merciless fanatics on both sides. It will be guerilla
warfare on a global scale, with no front lines and no identifiable enemy.
Osama bin Laden may be a primitive "figurehead" -- or even dead, for all we
know -- but whoever put those All-American jet planes loaded with
All-American fuel into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon did it with chilling
precision and accuracy. The second one was a dead-on bullseye. Straight into
the middle of the skyscraper.

Nothing -- even George Bush's $350 billion "Star Wars" missile defense
system -- could have prevented Tuesday's attack, and it cost next to nothing
to pull off. Fewer than 20 unarmed Suicide soldiers from some apparently
primitive country somewhere on the other side of the world took out the
World Trade Center and half the Pentagon with three quick and costless
strikes on one day. The efficiency of it was terrifying.

We are going to punish somebody for this attack, but just who or what will
be blown to smithereens for it is hard to say. Maybe Afghanistan, maybe
Pakistan or Iraq, or possibly all three at once. Who knows? Not even the
Generals in what remains of the Pentagon or the New York papers calling for
WAR seem to know who did it or where to look for them.

This is going to be a very expensive war, and Victory is not guaranteed --
for anyone, and certainly not for anyone as baffled as George W. Bush. All
he knows is that his father started the war a long time ago, and that he,
the goofy child-President, has been chosen by Fate and the global Oil
industry to finish it Now. He will declare a National Security Emergency and
clamp down Hard on Everybody, no matter where they live or why. If the
guilty won't hold up their hands and confess, he and the Generals will
ferret them out by force.

Good luck. He is in for a profoundly difficult job -- armed as he is with no
credible Military Intelligence, no witnesses and only the ghost of Bin Laden
to blame for the tragedy.

OK. It is 24 hours later now, and we are not getting much information about
the Five Ws of this thing.

The numbers out of the Pentagon are baffling, as if Military Censorship has
already been imposed on the media. It is ominous. The only news on TV comes
from weeping victims and ignorant speculators.

The lid is on. Loose Lips Sink Ships. Don't say anything that might give aid
to The Enemy.

Dr. Hunter S. Thompson's books include Hell's Angels, Fear and Loathing in
Las Vegas, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72, The Proud Highway,
Better Than Sex and The Rum Diary. His new book, Fear and Loathing in
America, has just been released. A regular contributor to various national
and international publications, Thompson now lives in a fortified compound
near Aspen, Colo. His column, "Hey, Rube," appears each Monday on Page 2.

Hi folks,

Just a short email to two lists to say hello and give you a little news.

I work at the base of the Empire State Building (not the World Trade Center,
as some of my Toronto friends thought).  My office is windowless, and I have
little rapport with my coworkers as I am the entire web department at the
CUNY Grad Center.  If no one wants to see me, I can be alone all day.

Yesterday, I showed up early to work, at 8:30, which is very rare for me.  I
had planned to spend some of the day tinkering with some essays, working on
a collaborative play that I am writing, and putting the new Student Handbook
online. So I stayed in my office from about 8:45 to 9:45 or so without
seeing anyone, or hearing of anything.  I was listening to WFMU on the
internet -- the dj for some reason made no mention of what was happening
outside, or if he did I missed it -- and though I thought it was curious
that the New York Times website was down, it wasn't unprecedented.

They were playing Xenakis on WFMU, but the dj cut it off claiming he wasn't
in the mood to listen to longer pieces.  He did mention things about traffic
flow in and out of New York, but I wasn't paying attention, didn't know the
context.  I decided to just go say hello to some of my coworkers, perhaps
influenced by the desultory tone of the dj.

I went into the office area (my office is down a separate hallway) and
noticed that Elizabeth, one of the administrative assistants, had what I
thought was a cool tiny television set on her desk.  It was on very loud,
and I just thought that it was Elizabeth (who, like me, likes to have some
media on while she works) being rebellious as she can be.

I picked up, said what a neat television set.  I noticed the image on the
screen, but didn't make any sense of it and decided not to bother, just put
it down and asked her when she got it.  I realize now that the image was of
the burning buildings, but it's just not something you see on television,
and this one was incredibly tiny though in color.

Then I started hearing phrases like "another plane is heading toward the
Empire State Building" etc.  Of course I eventually found out what was
happening -- maybe a few seconds disbelief, but it sunk in fast.  It struck
me as absurd that my coworkers would be so "calm" in such a situation; now
it even strikes me as irresponsible,  as no one thought to knock on my door
and tell me what was happening.  In any case they were quite nervous.

I got on the elevator and went outside.  Down Fifth Avenue, there it was.
It was the last time I saw the building.  It's difficult for me to even
think about it.  I think it is especially difficult now since, terrible as
that sight seemed at the time, it was still a moment when there was some
hope that the building, and the people still in it, could survive.

The first tower had already collapsed, so I was looking at the second tower.
As everyone knows in Manhattan, the towers are what orients us when we are
confused as which way is uptown and which down -- you can see them
everywhere.  On a clear day, I can see them from my apartment in Brooklyn.
To see them on fire is just indescribable -- somehow sublime, unlike
anything like a fire as the flames themselves, halfway up the building, are
hundreds of feet off the ground.

Like most people at the time, I felt that the thing to deal with was not
"escape" so much as "what to do"?  It seemed like the time for intelligent
action, but what was that? All bridges and tunnels were cut off, no subways,
rumors of more planes heading to New York, and no orders being given. All I
could think of was to get away from the Empire State Building, and thought
to go uptown.  Of course, uptown from there is everything from Times Square
to the UN building.  As I left my office I told everyone to get the hell out
of here, since people seemed pretty confused and were even trying to work
through it.

I decided instead to look for my sister, who lives in the Lower East Side.
Occasionally I stopped to look at a television that was on in a bar, and it
was on one of these sets that I first saw the building collapse (I was
inside when it happened).

I don't intend to run through the whole thing, and I'm not a gifted
journalist.  I just want to give some people an idea of how one person first
discovered that the city he lives in, which he had known all his life, first
came under attack.  The last moments before I actually found out seem
somehow precious to me.  This was a terribly thorough and wounding attack
that cut at the heart of what most people felt was "New York" at least since
the buildings went up, but certainly longer as the sense of hope and
optimism has been part of this place for decades.  Read those poems of
O'Hara's, or the Schuyler poem about looking at the UN, and you realize how
much the buildings and streets are just a part of everyone here.

At one time you could walk all the way downtown, stand next to the fountain
in between the two buildings and look straight up, and wonder what would
happen should these buildings fall.  But you felt so safe doing so.

Anyway, I couldn't find my sister as she had moved recently and I didn't
know exactly where she lived.  The phones were down.  I went to Tim Davis's
apartment, and luckily he was there with his girlfriend Lisa.  We watched
television for several hours, and then spent the rest of the day walking the
streets and visiting friends as we chanced upon their buildings.  I finally
got a call through to my mother and father, as well as my sisters.  I spent
the evening with Alissa Quart and some of her friends in a bar watching
television, and then in a community garden in the Lower East side talking
through this thing.  The garden seemed incredibly important to me at the
time.

I really felt like a different city.  In a sense, I felt like the city,
which we used to jokingly referred to as "an island of the coast of
America," was somehow closer to the world because of this, as New York has
never been the victim of anything to the proportion that so many European,
Middle Eastern, Central and South American and Asian cities have been --
bombings, attacks, natural disasters, etc.  The city was now on the ground,
and not orbiting the earth.  It seemed incredibly significant to be together
and share our ideas with each other, because we were preparing ourselves for
the potential of things falling away entirely, or at least more than we were
prepared for now.

I had all sorts of fine philosophical points to make (a "coda for Modernism"
was one phrase I was using; the image of the "fortress city" and the idea
that we may never build things like this again, also recurred), but I think
I'll just end it here.  My family's ok, I've heard word that Kenny Goldsmith
is fine, obviously Tim is, Jackson Mac Low, Charles Bernstein.  I haven't
made many calls myself but may try to get some people together for dinner
tonight.

I wish I had more news of specific people, but I'm sure that will come in in
bits.  I'm going to make some phone calls.  Thanks again from all of you who
wrote emails to check up on me and others.

Please provide news as you get it.  Thanks.

love
Brian

911
a poem written to deal with terror
September 11, 2001


a sloppy poem written to make it through this day





is this what our closed
Open society breeds?

It is 12:25 am the 12th and I have been here watching the TV
And typing on this event. Not cold blooded writing in a bow tie -- this is
only my method to cope

4 planes -- How does this happen?

An attack of planes on buildings -- bombing symbols
with people.

A CONCRETE STROM

The horror I feel
similar having just finished screaming.
That buzz of exhausted emotion.

No where else to go so I came home to be near the cats.

Everybody said that "boy that plane looks low"

There are no activities scheduled for the day. I packed a bag with warm
clothes and have the cat case out.
I hope we don't have to leave.

The number of casualties is not now known. THEY ARE CALLING IT A WAR, AN ACT
THAT DEFINES THE DAY AS ANOTHER INFAMY I saw the buildings fall on the TV.



            hijack
Another hijack
Another hijack
Another hijack

Not since 1981
Another hijack

Banks have been kept open, but trading is closed. The victims number by the
thousands.

I took the bus and heard of the suicide bomb of the PM of Afghanistan on the
classical station. The night before I pondered the 50 years called the Pax
Romana. I thought of how this related to our current 10 years of relative
peace.

8:30 law class with Ruth Hogan JD
a cool woman with suspicion in her eyes.
Another hijack
in the lounge with Dr. Sabitino, We talked on the nature of being and the
end goal of equality. Can it happen? How can this happen

IT looks bleak today while the autumn sun sparkles. I feel that anger that
leads to that want to take that life to make this situation right again. The
leaves will turn color soon.

2 towers down.
10 thousand might be dead.
My god

I have lost my love for this country and how it acts towards others. But
today with possible targets and probable targets.

Tom Brokaw calls it the darkest day in American history.
Peter Jennings calls this a day that will be etched in our minds
Dan Rather say this day will be remembered by all

Now just imagine how fast someone must have had to tie their necktie to make
the early morning cab ride to catch the 7:45 plane flight and make it
through security to be on time. The woman at the sidewalk gave him shit for
his over loaded carry-on luggage, typical. What I need all of this stuff.
Fuck. The crowd in the airport café was too much to grab a quick bite to
eat. Call the wife to get dry cleaning and I'll be home tonight ... where to
eat? A Starbucks in an airport? A woman with big hair and small child bumps
into him -- a coffee spill -- on the white shirt. What a day ...

Then what. How did it play out. Who were they. Did they have guns, what did
you think when the World tower grew closer. Did you cry? Could you do
anything? Did you know ....

I am crying for these people and the story of their last moments. They went
to school and not a military camp to train.

All are coming together as americans over you. This has never happened
before -- ever. Not in a super bowl, over a movie, a political -- but the
beauty of america is its ability to join in spirit over its sorrow. All
colors bleed

It will soon turn tide to rage. Not even McViegh, columbine,
or Manson will hold the power they once had.

It comes on a cool september day, the day I was to take down the //YOU poem.
A poem of Human potential.

My poetry will change nothing .

As I write we still do not know, that is if we ever will .... It is 2:50 PM
and I choose to write in purple.

Police officer: It's personal

Big Mike, who I haven't seen in years was at the bus station. Going to the
dentist, I think. I was honest about not coming back to the coffee bean café
where he tends the morning counter. He is the perfect son of a bitch, well
at least my favorite one. He has  ideas of how the world should work and he
uses a knife and (or) a folding walking stick to prove his point. Great
human; he's been dirty.

His suggestion to solve this situation is to go to the stockyards in
chicago, fill cargo planes with pig blood and innards, and drop them (crop
dust) Mecca and all the muslim states. This would save lives and render
unclean all areas the blood would touch.  Waste no bombs on these people!
Hit them in their heart, they hit ours.

speech must be dynamic.  Poor Mr. Bush is not dynamic in his words. I do not
pray, but today I pray for him. He has the job and one must follow in times

Charles,

Thank you for this. And for subtracting another family from my list of
fears. Sometimes-- not always, and certainly not for long -- the best
question is, "What happened?" and the best answer, "This is what I saw."
Stacked up against all I've heard otherwise in the constant stream of
"expert commentary" from the television, to which I too am addicted,
your account gives me less reason for horror at what might yet come, and
more hope that there is a human response still possible.

In the midst of such enormity as yesterday's events, the best I can
manage, after all the television, all the busy signals, all the
unanswered emails, is to read. I suppose I'm searching for something to
help me get my head and heart around the loss and powerlessness, in such
a way that my response doesn't turn to the easy extremes of revenge
fantasies or "we deserved it" fatalism. A text from Benjamin ("Theses on
the Philosophy of History"), so familiar I can almost recite it from
memory, a text that's become almost a truism, moves me somewhat in that
direction:

"A Klee painting named 'Angelus Novus' shows an angel looking as though
he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His
eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how
one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past.
Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe
which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his
feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what
has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got
caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer
close them. This storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which
his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward.
This storm is what we call progress."

And lest we remain in any doubt about what this progress represents --
and for whom -- there's this, from a bit earlier in the same text:

"[A]ll rulers are the heirs of those who conquered before them. Hence,
empathy with the victor inevitably benefits the rulers. Historical
materialists know what that means. Whoever has emerged victorious
participates to this day in the triumphal procession in which the
present rulers step over those who are lying prostrate."

If one can approach such a monstrous act with a fairly simple calculus,
it might be said that yesterday's attack gave rise to two sets of
victors, two "powers" who will make "progress" in the world over all the
dead and all the debris. First, there are the authors of the act, who
have reminded us that we can be terrified, helpless, brutalized, that
ones we know and love can bleed and die. Did anyone need such reminding?
And then there are those who, in this country and throughout "the West,"
will use the horror of that act to justify the further militarization
(in the name of security) and de-secularization (in the name of a
struggle against "Islamic fundamentalism") of entire societies, and the
decimation of entire others, along the lines of "our" ongoing policy in
Iraq, and in the name of "retaliation" and "just war."

I don't want to find myself on either of these winning sides. And it
seems the only other option, right now, is to acknowledge my horror and
relative powerlessness. Of course, like many others, I gave blood, and
I'll take to the streets with what I can only hope will be many others
if it's suggested that innocents elsewhere should die in my name. But
right now, if I'm to feel solidarity, it's with those killed and
injured, and their families, and my friends whose survival remains
uncertain.

Uncertainty. I'm left saying, "my thoughts are with you," and I'm not
sure what that might mean. When one's solidarity is precisely what's
loneliest, it seems only truisms remain. Otherwise, it's as if the
language were momentarily in abeyance. Of course, given that much of
what's being said otherwise is so ugly, one might be glad that an
imagination of companionship remains, however futile. Here I'm thinking
of the sign my mother saw in front of a church on her drive home today
from work in Tampa to her home in Pasco County, Florida: "Our God is
bigger than yours." If we need to invoke a God, whatever God, at such a
moment, let that God be one to save us from the victors of such a
struggle. And save our friends, or at least help us to save their
memories from such desecration.

And since we're left -- or I'm left -- with only the truism for the
moment, let's at least be honest about it. "Our thoughts are with you"
because the head and heart I named earlier are out of place, out of
joint, and out of answers. We commend ourselves to each other's care,
even where that's become impossible, beyond a still unimaginable loss.

There's a recent translation of Lorca by Jerome Rothenberg that I left
beside my bed Monday night. Picking it up in numb shock after several
hours of Tuesday morning's news, I opened at random to several lines
that seemed to have become a memorial in advance. Whether that's owing
to Lorca's own revivalist stance toward a culture in which Muslims,
Christians, and Jews coexisted -- not always peacefully, but for a long
time without the rhetoric of annihilation -- or whether it's simply an
effect of a chance coincidence of lexicon, or the power of present
murder and disaster to annex the past to themselves, I don''t know. I
know I'll never hear this poem the same way, as it ends:

"       Clang-clang.
(The Earth was heading off, paved over with domes
under the atmosphere's eggshell blue.)


        Who goes there?


(Between milklight & moonlight
I arrive at the tower where the others await me)."

And now Tanya has come home from work and switched the TV on, and I see
evacuation orders for the Empire State Building and possibly all of
midtown. Please be well. Our thoughts are with  you, again.

Peace,
Taylor Brady

I love Hunter but really have trouble with these quick immediate facile
response analyses right off the bat. The truth is we don't fucking know a
thing and that's the nature of catastrophe - that we are faced with the
inert, immobile.

Take this:


Nothing -- even George Bush's $350 billion "Star Wars" missile defense
system -- could have prevented Tuesday's attack, and it cost next to
nothing to pull off. Fewer than 20 unarmed Suicide soldiers from some
apparently primitive country somewhere on the other side of the world took
out the World Trade Center and half the Pentagon with three quick and
costless strikes on one day. The efficiency of it was terrifying.

Well in fact it cost a LOT to pull off from what's coming out - the flight
lessons alone here in Florida were $25000 per person.

But let's analyze fast and clever.

It sickens me. And some "apparently primitive country"? In these days of
multiculturalism - what exactly constitutes an apparently primitive
country?

And so forth and so on.

Tuesday morning, my mother in Chicago calls and wakes me. She tells me what
happened; confused and groggy, I make a joke about Dubya and get angry at
the GOP. I wonder if my law school's open, and think about going to my
polling place on 1st Avenue and 9th Street.

Then I turn on the television, just in time to see the buildings collapse. I
can't leave my couch, trying to piece things together, wondering if it's
appropriate to drink at 11 am. I go to the deli for soda instead. As I
leave, I don't even bother double-locking my apartment door, does it really
matter? I take a deep breath, step outside and smile warily at the few
people standing around St. Marks Place. Glancing over at First Avenue, I see
that it's been blocked off and guarded by police.

The deli on St. Marks and Avenue A is run by several Muslim men from Yemen.
There, I stock up on cat food. Several white boys from the nearby school
come in asking for water, then yell at the man behind the counter, calling
him a dirty Arab terrorist. He rolls his eyes at me; we both know this
happens to him every day, bombings notwithstanding.

My building super, Ricardo, walks past. He tells me, "It's like the city has
been raped."

I unlock my door and walk into the bathroom, placing some rewetting drops in
my eyes. As I'm rinsing the soot out of my mouth, I burst into tears. The
cats start crying. The rest of Tuesday is filled with flipping through
catalogs and solving crossword puzzles, CNN blaring in the background, but
it's really the foreground--I'm not distracted and I'm crying once an hour.
I think about a guy I met in a bar a few weeks ago who works for Deutsche
Bank and wonder where he is.

Tuesday night I go to bed at 6 am Wednesday morning. The dark, I'm scared of
it. The planes flying overhead, I'm scared of those, too. The computer has
been on for two days, diligently checking email every 10 minutes. I think of
that Peter Gabriel song, "Contact." Must talk to someone, anyone, make sure
we're all still alive.

Giuliani, just saw him on tv--he looks like hell. Tried to give blood today
at Beth Israel and Cabrini--thanks, but they don't need any more. They need
more patients. I walk in and out of stores near Stuyvesant Town, just
looking for nothing in particular, just trying to look away from people
walking around, aimlessly and in tears, people like me. The state troopers
don't check my identification as I walk back below 14th Street. I offer to
show it to them along with the contents of my brown paper bag from
Ess-a-Bagel. They say, "No, that's okay, we trust you."

I walk past the masjid on 12th street and 1st avenue--it's unusually quiet
for 5 pm. A man on the corner stares at my chest and before I can get
offended, I remember that I'm wearing my Star of David.

I can't decide what to do or whom to help or how to help and should I still
pray even though I'm mad at God?

Sorry for the length/babble--I hope and pray all of you and yours are safe.

I honestly can't say that I am behind the United States in "whatever they
do" at this point.  Bush made a technical declaration of war this morning
which means that Congress is hands off for the next sixty days.  With a
President looking to "hunt down those folks" in charge I am intensely afraid
of what his retaliation will consist of.
The kind of racism showing itself in this country following yesterday's
attack is chilling: a mosque was burned down in Texas, a Pakistani owned
convenience store in Long Island was stoned and I heard from a Muslim friend
this morning about having obscenities yelled into her car on her drive to
work.  I'd be wary of reducing an entire people to being "nut cases" or
"sub-human."  I think it's a fairly simplistic response to something far
more complicated than name calling.

All of our lives hang in the balance.  It is most important that Russia and
China participate.  That lessens to likelihood of nuclear war.  But first,
just who are the perpetrators?  And, we had better avoid demonization and
stereotyping.

------- Forwarded message from: Rabbi Arthur Waskow <Awaskow@aol.com>

Dear Chevra,

The following message comes from the Palestinian town of Beit Sahour on the
West Bank. Their unambiguous condemnation of the barbaric attack yesterday
stands in stark contrast to the message the major media is putting out about
Palestinian "joy" over this heinous act.

Not that the official media are "wrong." -- No doubt some Palestinians are
celebrating this successful attack on what they see as the supplier of arms and
money to their occupiers.

But the official media ARE wrong in not reporting the mix of opinion, in not
reporting the truth of deep disagreements among Palestinians.

Some  are horrified at this attack, as they have been by attacks on Israeli
civilians. [After the Beit Sahour report, see also the report from East
Jerusalem.]

From: Beit Sahour Municipality

In the name of Beit Sahour Municipality and in the name of each and
every citizen of the Shepherds field Beit Sahour; we convey our deepest
condolences to the entire American people for the horrific loss of
innocent lives as a result of the horrible acts of terror.  In
particular, we share the grievances of all the families of the victims.
We pray to God to please give these families the patience and the
strength.

 As Palestinians who suffer daily form acts of Israeli aggression
against our innocent people, we cannot find the words to express how
shocked we were to see the horrific scenes on TV.  We condemn such acts
and we do not accept such horrific acts in the 3rd millennium where
peace, prosperity, and freedom should cover the whole world.

We reiterate our deepest condemnation of this horrible act on these
innocent humans.  No matter how can we express our sorrow, we can't find
enough words to say how sorry we are.

Please let us work together to stop these acts of terrorism all over the
world.  Let us work hand in hand for establishing a safer world to live
in.

p.s. Please pass on this message to all our friends; we want them to
know that each person in Beit Sahour shares this message with us.

thanks mark ducharme and laura wright for your posts,

i've been doing a lot of reading re: bin laden and his work for the cia.
the u.s.a. has been running terrorism schools around the globe for a long
time.  i hope that this will give us a chance to re-think our own acts of
terrorism.  more acts of violence on our part can only make things worse.

Creeley read at Kent State last night.  Jessica Grim came over for dinner
beforehand.  It's been almost 30 years since I last heard RC in person.  A
moving occasion but one filled with a sense of melancholy given the concerns
of recent days.

Came home  to find an e-mail from my father in Connecticut speaking of my
brother Jim's 2nd day of efforts at the WTC.  Jimmy's crew on Wednesday
consisted of 150 ironworkers from all over the greater NYC area.  These guys
are really working hard, using cranes and torches, to move tons of material
so that Police and Fire personnel can remove bodies/body parts.

It all sounds pretty horrific, like something out of Bosch.  Jimmy's the
youngest of four siblings and typically the most cheerful, good natured and
unflappable person you could meet.  I am worried for him given the stress
he's undergoing  and just incredibly proud of him too.  He has had nothing
but great things to say about all of the people working with him.

He'd probably be surprised and mildly bugged to know I'm writing about him
like this but no other response is possible at the moment.

One of Jim's first jobs as an ironworker many years ago was welding inside of
the tip of the torch of the Statue of Liberty during its renovation.  At the
time he was the skinniest  guy  on the crew--the only person who could fit in
some of the confined spaces that needed to be entered in order to do the
work.  And he loved it.

I can't think of anyone I admire more right now than Jim and the many, many
other construction, Police and Fire people who are combing the ruins of the
WTC.

Love for Certain Work

This one loves the ways that heated iron

The way sticks and pieces of dead grass

from last night--

The wind's changed, and tonight we're getting something of the
taste and smell of the smoke, which plumes north-northeast
through the clear evening sky, Mars standing high over New York
Harbor to the south. We were out only briefly, to walk a couple
blocks south on West Street and cross over to the Hudson River
Park, where we stood for a few minutes looking down at the
WTC area, where some of the standing structures were silhouetted
by emergency lights against the great white cloud arising behind
them.

As we had seen shortly before on the BBC, people along West
Street farther south were cheering and applauding emergency
workers--both those coming north, and those relieving them
going south.

This morning, there was no New York Times outside our apartment
door as there usually is, so after a cup of coffee or two, we headed
out to find a paper.

The Bus Stop, our local breakfast joint, already had a line as we
passed, and we soon found that no newspapers had been delivered
to stores or curbside boxes below 14th Street. And the streets were
empty of traffic--a few emergency vehicles, but mostly walkers
and people on bikes. Most stores were locked and shuttered.

At 8th Ave. and 14th. St., we passed through the police barricades
and headed north, above 14th. St. Non-essential vehicles were
prohibited below 14th St. Basically, we walked up 8th to 23rd St.
and then east to 6th Ave. and then north to 42nd St. We bought
a Post, and then an Observer, and then a Wall Street Journal,
and then a News--but no NYT. So, we walked back west along
42nd St., thinking we'd find one easily at the Port Authority Bus
Terminal, forgetting that the bridges and tunnels were closed, and
thus the buses wouldn't be running. The PA was closed and
barracaded, so we started back down 8th Ave.

We found our Times at Penn Station, two levels down below
street level, at a Hudson News Stand where the guy at the cash
register said there were no more Times at the same moment
another guy was unloaded a new batch onto the floor.

Lynda, our newspapers, and I then continued on down 8th
Ave. until we decided, weirdly, to stop in at the Utopia luncheonette
at the corner of 8th and 27th, the same place we'd stopped
on our walk downtown the very first time I'd trained up to Baltimore
to see her some twelve years or more ago now. Somehow, it
was just a rest stop for us now, and not a bit nostalgic--well,
maybe just a smidgen. So, we ate breakfast, with our unread
newspapers on the chair beside me, and with pop-songs and
Dubya on the PA-ed radio. I had only five bucks in my wallet,
so the waiter and I tried two different credit cards before we
found one for which the telephone call would go through.

People were moving everywhere we went, moving uptown,
downtown, like us with newspapers. Not in Penn Station,
though. There folks were standing in long lines for tickets,
or sprawled in the waiting room (only for ticketed passengers).

At the 14th St. barrier, police were checking IDs of people
wanting to go farther south, into the Village. A woman in blue
was asking two gals and a guy if they had IDs showing they
lived there. Lynda and I just walked past, and were nearly
home. The line outside the Bus Stop was even longer.

Back in the apartment, two messages on the machine told
each of us separately that the Eugene Lang College of the
New School University would be closed today, the building
being used as a clearinghouse/information center for people
who couldn't find people.

So, once again we wavered between CNN and NY1 on the
cable-connected TV. The little one without cable brought
in only Channel 2, the local CBS station. All the other
New York stations were off the air (though not off cable),
since their transmitters had gone down yesterday with the WTC.


from this morning--

Here's what the morning commute in the NYC area
looks like today. This website has pages for places
all over the country, so have a look. This URL is
specifically for the NYC area, but click around and
you'll find others.

http://newyork.metrocommute.com/

My Tuesday-Friday commute is by PATH train to
Newark. I catch the Journal Square train at Christopher
Street, just before it goes under the Hudson River and
into New Jersey.

                "There is now PATH service from 33rd
                Street to Newark/Hoboken every 5-10
                minutes, but there is no service to Exchange
                Place in Jersey City. You must transfer to
                the light rail at Pavonia Avenue. The World
                Trade Center line will be out for perhaps
                several years, or more."

At Journal Square in Jersey City, I usually transfer to the Newark
train, which comes/came out of the WTC. Just outside Jersey
City, the train comes out of its tunnel and travels above ground
the rest of the way into Penn Station in Newark. Much of the
way, the WTC towers were once visible beyond the unseen Hudson.
Tomorrow I'll see a different landscape.

I can understand now how the Israelis feel surrounded by nut
cases.And although I'm not a great supporter of Israel (I know there were
injustices by themm and they have been agressive at times) . . .


1) I would argue that the simplistic shot is a declaration of war against
"enemies who hide in the shadows," a call for Americans to sacrifice civil
liberties, a request for an immediate $20 billion increase in the defense
budget, assuming "God Bless America" is an appropriate response to scores o=

f
coming to terms with what we have wrought, the day after a tragedy or 20
years later, was either cheap or simplistic, our government would be doing
it.=20

2) Let's bear in  mind that one of the injustices, perhaps considered a bit
agressive, perpetrated by the U.S. and Israel, was usurping the
Palestinians' homeland.

Combating Terrorism
Bill Thomson
September 12, 2001

Yesterday's horrible events in New York and Washington, DC require all of
us to express collective disbelief at the appalling loss of innocent
human
life and to express our heartfelt condolences to the victims, their
families and their friends.  Such brutal slaughter must be
unconditionally
condemned whenever and wherever it occurs.  No cause, no matter how nobly
perceived by its followers, can justify such wanton destruction of
innocent
people.

Today, as we inevitably begin the healing process and the search for
answers and solutions, there is much speculation about who the
perpetrators
of these acts might be, and what form an appropriate retaliation might
take.  This morning's New York Times states that  "the best defense
against
terrorism is good, timely intelligence", and other media, government and
military officials suggest a wide range of retaliatory options, ranging
from overwhelming military strikes to Draconian suspensions of our most
cherished freedoms and liberties--freedoms and liberties which define the
unique American experience.

In order to understand yesterday's events and to prevent their
reoccurrence, I believe that we need to consider two ideas.  First, I
think
we must accept the fact that there is not, and can never be, a 100%
foolproof intelligence or military remedy for terrorist acts.  I would
even
go so far as to say that unless certain basic changes are made in our
political and economic outlook as Americans, such acts will inevitably
reoccur, and they will become increasing deadly.  Just as we today look
at
the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center as "mild=94 in comparison to
yesterday's events, I believe that with the increased miniaturization of
nuclear capability and the widespread availability of chemical and
biological toxins, some day we  will be faced with events of
overwhelmingly
tragic dimensions.  Just as there is no way to stop people from
committing
murder if they are willing to give up their lives, there can also not be
any way to guarantee our collective safety from individuals or groups who
are willing to sacrifice their lives in a terrorist attack.

The second consideration is ask a question which has been completely
absent
in the analysis of yesterday's tragedy--why would a person or group
commit
such a heinous act?  Why would the United States be chosen, and why would
the particular targets of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon be
picked?  Whoever is found to be the perpetrators of yesterday's
terrorism,
it is certain that they will be demonized and characterized as somehow
being outside the pale of human understanding.  And if we demonize
sufficiently, we might be able to justify our need for revenge, but we
will
have missed a crucial opportunity for understanding, and for gaining the
insight and wisdom that are the only tools with which we might avoid
future
attacks.

At the risk of sounding like an apologist for a despicable act, I would
like to provide some possibilities for understanding the roots of this
tragedy:

1.  We Americans, comprising some 4% of the world=92s population, consume
approximately 40% of its resources.  We appear to assume that the
resources
found in other parts of the world are somehow our birthright.  Imagine
how
this is experienced in third world countries, many of whom have been the
recipient of United States military attacks.

2.  We maintain this consumption, in large part, because we have the most
powerful military in the world, and since WW II we have not hesitated to
use it for political and/or economic gain in places like China (1945-46),
Korea (1950-53), China (1950-53), Guatemala (1954), Indonesia (1958),
Cuba
(1959-60), Guatemala (1960), Congo (1964), Peru (1965), Laos (1964-73),
Vietnam (1961-73), Cambodia (1969-70), Guatemala (1967-69), Grenada
(1983),
Libya (1986), El Salvador (1980s), Nicaragua (1980s), Panama (1989), Iraq
(1991-present), Sudan (1998), Afghanistan (1998) and Yugoslavia (1999).
We
have bombed each of these countries in turn, and in NO case did a
democratic government, respectful of human rights, occur as a direct
result.  Through our weapons and/or proxies, innocent civilians of
Indonesia, East Timor, Chile, Nicaragua and Palestine have also been
victims of the United States.  Is it any wonder that the level of hatred
of
the United States is so high?   Former President Jimmy Carter stated, "We
have only to go to Lebanon, to Syria, to Jordan, to witness firsthand the
intense hatred among many people for the United States, because we bombed
and shelled and unmercifully killed totally innocent villagers, women and
children and farmers and housewives, in those villages around Beirut...as
a
result, we have become a kind of Satan in the minds of those who are
deeply
resentful. That is what precipitated the taking of hostages and that is
what has precipitated some terrorist attacks."  (New York Times3/26/89)

3.  Forty-nine percent of our income tax dollar goes for present and past
military-related activities.  On April 16, 1953, former President Dwight
Eisenhower noted that "Every gun that is made, every warship launched,
every rocket fired, signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who
hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and not clothed."  For the
cost
of a Stealth bomber, we could put an additional teacher or social worker
in
every middle and high school in the United States.  The cost of the
proposed missile defense shield would add several more.  Which of these
options would add most to our national security?

In short, I believe that we are paying a terrible price for a very
shortsided and egocentric American political and economic worldview, and
unless we change this worldview, I am concerned that yesterday's tragedy
will be only a down payment on the retribution yet to come.

And here is a further article from the same site, worth pondering.

A Few Words
by Ali Abunimah
Vice-president of the Arab-American Action Network and a well-known media
analyst, Abunimah regularly writes public letters to the media, coordinates
campaigns, and appears on a variety of national and international news
programs as a commentator on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He is one of
the founders of The Electronic Intifada.



Chicago -- It is extremely hard to write this morning, and yet I feel I have
to. Everything hurts so much. After a few hours sleep, I woke up in the
dark, hoping and praying that I had woken up from a nightmare. The nightmare
is still there. Today, as dawn breaks over New York City and the country, we
will start to come face to face with the enormous tragedy and crime that
struck yesterday, and we will begin to learn of countless thousands of
families whose loved ones have been ripped from them. They have will have
names and faces. It is beyond imagination and comprehension.

Since yesterday the newscasts have been rife with speculation about who
could have carried out this awful crime. File footage of Ussama Bin Laden
appears on every screen. Rumors of Arabs being arrested, or Arabic-language
materials being found by police are already being made much of. On top of
the pain we are all feeling for the continuing tragedy, this fills me with
fear. The fact is no one yet knows who was capable of such a sophisticated
assault on the world's most powerful country.

National Public Radio this morning focussed on reports of TV pictures of
Palestinians celebrating at the blow struck against the United States. These
images fill me with disgust and shame that anyone could put on such a
display. Peter Jennings on ABC News was more careful in his analysis,
pointing out that while some Palestinians in the occupied territories may
have felt that way, his experience in the Middle East suggests that many
many more people all over the Arab world will be feeling sadness and shock,
"because of their deep attachments to the United States." He said, for
example that more people from the "deeply troubled" Palestinian city of
Ramallah live in the United States than in Ramallah itself. That is my
experience too. I have not spoken to one person who is not utterly horrified
by what has happened.

I will not here try to explain why some Palestinians may have felt joy at
seeing America humiliated, and dealt a horrible blow. If I had been under
bombardment and siege for more than a year and occupation for more than
three decades, I hope that I would keep my humanity and not surrender to the
basest emotions, and I am sure that most Palestinians have not. While all
our attention was focussed on the unfolding events in the United States,
nine Palestinians were killed when Israeli forces attacked the city of Jenin
in the occupied West Bank last night, and another three Palestinians were
killed elsewhere. Twelve more people died. A ridiculously small number
compared to what the United States has just suffered, but another enormous,
unbearable tragedy for each of their families. As enormous and unbearable as
each loss suffered by the Israelis and that will be suffered by so many
American families.

I hope too that Americans will maintain their humanity and not surrender to
their basest feelings as understandable anger, frustration and grief rise.
Arabs and Muslims in America now live with real fear and apprehension. From
early yesterday morning, I began receiving to my website, as well as to the
email of the Arab American Action Network messages that only deepened the
pain of the day.

"You are going to feel the wrath of all Americans. LEAVE this country while
you can. ALL ARABS ARE COWARDS AND BARBARIANS. DEATH TO ALL ARABS ALL
PERSIANS ALL MUSLIMS!!!!!!!" wrote Darrell Hawley, adding for good measure
that Arabs, Muslims and "Persians" "deserve nothing less than
extermination."

"Pay back time...will come soon," was the simple message from
REise99@aol.com.

Doug asked "Ali, why do your people love when civilians are killed. You are
Evil."

"Dear dirty towel-heads," wrote Brook Shuler, "Please take your illogical,
misogynistic and murdering religion back to the Middle East. We have
tolerated you disgusting people long enough in our country." Brook added "I
hope the US wipes out every man, women and child Arab in the middle east.
You people, like the AIDS virus, are a disease of this world. I will rest
more easily when all of you are dead."

This is just a sampling of what I received. While I am fortunate to have
received only words of hate, I fear others may be victims of much worse. But
this is not the whole story, and this is not the America I know and that I
was born in that is speaking. What made a far greater impression on me were
the many messages of support from friends and strangers.

"Do not be discouraged and do not let these few angry people blemish the
good image you have of Americans," wrote Gabor Mester.

Marc from California wrote "I am a Jewish American. I am grateful for your
work, and for your existence. We are in this together. Whatever happens, we
are all Americans and world citizens. We are people of good will and peace,
and this tragedy is all of ours."

An unidentified person wrote "A lot of us know, even it actually happens
that these terrorists are of arab-origins, they do not speak for all of the
arab people. The same way Timothy Mc Veigh was not representative of the
American people."

"I am an American citizen who is deeply concerned for the safety of all our
Arab-American citizens. My ancesters were European but I consider myself to
be just another human being in the larger family of human beings. I am very
fond of the Arabic people and culture. I most sincerely hope that each and
everyone of you remains safe, and free of injury to your persons, your
homes, and your businesses. Love and peace to each of you" was the message
from "C.G."

At my work place, so many of my colleagues came to my office to ask about my
family. Many friends in New York offered to take them in. My sister, her
husband and their young daughter live literally in the shadow of the World
Trade Center. The worst moment of my life was watching on TV as the first
World Trade Center tower collapsed on to their neighborhood. I spent an
intensely agonizing time yesterday morning before I could get in touch with
them and learn that they were safe and reassure the rest of my family. They
are now in a hotel, unable to go home, but they are safe. So many thousands
of people are not so lucky and are still waiting in agony for news of their
loved ones. Friends from non-Arab organizations in Chicago came forward to
say they will hold a press conference today to urge their fellow citizens
not to take part in a backlash and to realize that whoever is responsible
for this awful crime, that does not make millions of people guilty.

It is this caring, compassionate America I will choose to see. It is this
America that helped me get through my day yesterday and that will help
millions of people to survive hardest days yet to come. It is this America
that I will continue to be a part of and to stand with in the face of
enormous evil and tragedy. I hope too that this America will stand with Arab
Americans, Muslims and all others who may be targeted or defamed because of
what happened. I hope that people in the Middle East will stand with
Americans in human solidarity as we here have stood with people in the
Middle East and supported them as they too have been victimized by senseless
violence, loss and ongoing injustice.

I hope that we will all use words and take actions that will heal and
support each other and try to maintain our calm and humanity in the face of
incalculable suffering and sadness.

Before and after the WTC incident I've been reading Peter D. Kramer's novel
_Spectacular Happiness_.  The book's written from the viewpoint of a bomber.
Kramer, of course, is the psychiatrist who wrote _Listening to Prozac_.
Anyone else reading this now or recently?

Charles,

Sorrow for you and everyone in New York.  My brother works in finance, but
fortunately was not in the area at the time, and I stood in front of TV in
amazement and grief like the rest of the world.  At Stanford, the library
received a bomb threat, and we looked at the yellow tape as a sad mockery,
a reminder of how fragile the mind and art and learning and compassion can
be.  The Library of Alexandria, the World Trade Center.

Apocalypse is Greek for unveiling or revealing, and I think we can say
we've seen the fabric of reality torn and what has been revealed is the
utter horror of human depravity.  It doesn't take much -- except
determination and dedication and an absolute disregard for life -- to
destroy.  Such an attack is a crime against humanity, and war sentiment is
instantly reaching fever pitch, and I am afraid more horror is on the
way.  The dust will not settle.

This is very rough (as a poem at least), but I thought I'd share this....
(any comments, aesthetic or ethical, political, pos. or neg., welcome----)

Chris


Social Solipsism: A Perverse Response to Recent Tragedy

Proof at last America is not an isolationalist!

Though you’d never guess it by recent reports
There’s a war going on between
“will the circle (of violence) be unbroken”
and “I’m mad as hell & I’m not going to take it anymore”

I had thoroughly repressed my nostalgia for New York these last two months
(not so much by proactively making new memories here
as by curbing further curiosities until I began to digest
what for years sat stranded on the tastebuds)
until thefire’s gray glare on my black and white TV
gave proof through the morn the towers weren’t there.

Now, I almost envy my friends there, I long.
It’s like they all sent me this giant “wish you were here” postcard.
Sure, none of them have yet come forth
To tell me of the death of someone close
And some were awfully lucky
Like Fred who works there & never oversleeps,
Who on this one day did.

But even if one has died,
I wave no flag but dig out the peacesign
To wear like a bible over my breast pocket
To prevent the bullet of the flags
From flapping in my face.
I wear the button like a finger
That could become a hand
If 4 others joined me in flipping its bird at Bush.

This is what I think it meant to be a hippy-punk
When his dad’s “kinder, gentler” war-itch
Hadn’t yet latched on Saddam:
“I’m in love with everyone…
but don’t go putting flowers in my gun”
(sayeth the Volcano Suns). The DJ laughs,
“Tonight the L.A. Guns are playing”
though business as usual is disrupted
and Bush has not yet begun bombing
(silent night, sooty night, 7 O’Clock news….)
“Nuclear winter lasts millions of years…”

It’s that in-between crisis epiphany
When folks are shaken to the root
And may, if not for the news, question everything
And since I’ve always been more concerned
With the atrocities closer to me
To the point where I run the risk of self-laceration,
Biting the hand that feeds me
When I’ve already eaten more than I can digest
And, even in poetry circles, get called a “native informer”
For pointing out inconsistencies (that would be okay
if they weren’t evident in those who claim to value consistency)
In the “avant” poetics of those who criticize
What they call mainstream
More than I lash out at the follies and fuck ups and (minor) atrocities
Of those I would have to be less isolationalist
And more imperialist to even meet,
I see the news trying to tell me it’s my duty to be an imperialist.
No more now, “to defend freedom,” than ever.

And even if I’m all thumbs,
I point my psychic sidekick gun at Bush,
Enough of a yippee if not quite a hippie
To allow you to say my bang flags, my blanks
Are more like flowers than flags on tanks
Enough of a punk and sort of a monk
To know that the working title for the Clash’s
Only top ten American hit (which “coincidentally”
Had anti-Arab sentiments) was “rob the cashbox.”

Bush, you make Eisenhauer seem a peacenik by comparison
(as if 5 little words, “Beware the military industrial complex”
could expiate his guilt, and erase 8 long years of “Leave It To Beaver”
while Beats and panthers bubbled beneath the Joneses
even Baraka was at this point still trying to keep up with---
who would’ve guessed that ground would seem more fertile 40 years later?)

Bush, I know it’s as bad for me to single you out
As it is for you to single out that terrorist in Afghanistan
And I know you are but an iceberg tip
Of a military-post industrial complex
Symbolized by the three buildings whose fire
Gives proof through these days that you are still there,
Bigger than ever, a complex bigger and older than you,
Like Chaney perhaps, but bigger than him too

But now is not the time to address the faceless world incurious
Much less to hail the chimp
And I could even, if only for strategic reasons,
Grant your heart, and the heart of those
Who bought you the election, is in the right place,
That you truly care about the safety of people like myself
Who very well have been in the basement
Of the towers transferring from the N and the R
To the Path Train to get to my adjunct job at Rutgers
Had I not been fortuitiously offered a better job
Far enough from ground zero to worry about rolling blackouts…

And that you would certainly not want to be mistaken
For the kind of Christian who would crucify Christ
Is perchance the second coming of the one and only God
Were to happen as you say,
And that that Bible you tote for the cameras
Actually says “thou shalt not kill…unless an Arab,
Or unless he killed first…”

But did they kill first really??
I’ll let someone like Dan Bouchard fill in the details
With numerous historical examples by which the people
Of your administration (to say nothing of your family)
Were involved; suffice it to say I know
And there’s evidence, there’s blood on your hands
And now it’s not just foreign, not just enlisted.

The chickens haven’t quite come home to roost
Because you’re alive, lucky as Fred, or just like Saddam
If not the Iraqi civilians too poor to outsmart your bombs
But they have come home to some who supported you---
Though probably more who didn’t
(since there were more janitors in the pentagon,
More clerks in the trade towers,
Than senators, lobbyists, and warriors)

And even if they were duped like my dad
Not realizing the reason he was laid off
Was close kin to the reason the stockmarket was up,
And even if I’m duped by believing
That killing the men who killed them
Won’t make things any safer for us survivors
And, if anything, can make things worse,
I know that it is not too cool to be ridiculed
(especially by most of the world’s population)
but that you brought this upon yourself
and the Wonder’s brilliant double negative
makes me really wish you’d do nothing,
make nothing happen like Auden (if not Pound’s) idea of poetry,
submit your swords to Ploughshares magazine,
your warfare to The Germ, or maybe even Fence,
I mean the one you can sit on
Between isolationalism and imperialism.

But, failing that, spit your bile out in a slam
Even if the pen isn’t mightier.
Oh, be weak and squishy, like Falstaff
Or I as a lad when the neighbor boy came at me with fists
And though I didn’t punch him in the fist with my face
I ran home I’m proud to say
While the roots of the ugly tree my dad chopped down
Sprang up as 20 more---

We weren’t safe before, but now that we know it,
What shall we do? And why should we listen to you?
There’s no one else to listen to.
You have the answer, you got the cure.
The news is with you, but the becomes a
And I suppose your guess is more or less as bad as mine
As Thom Yorke holds his “let Ralph debate” sign
Like Dylan’s “Watch Out” or “Dig Yourself”
And I do, pausing for gold, pausing for shit,
Pausing for what I hope’s not mere wit
Or the “premature conspiracy theories”
A new friend accuses me of—

For I know that during the long lean years
That I have craved a stock market crash,
A disruption of business as usual,
And that there’s a side to me
That would defend the Unabomber
On the grounds he killed far less
Than he did as a cog in the warmachine
At respectable M.I.T

And I know this could be treason
Were it not that I believe, as you
Claim you do, that killing is wrong
Even if by taking my position
To its logical consequences,
I’d probably be considered suicidal
At least in a society where the death penalty
Is more legal than euthanasia
So I sympathize and forgive
The man who kills in the heat of the moment, in self-defence,
Much more than the political terror of the CIA
Or whoever it was who hijacked those planes
And may even (heaven forbid) be forced into that situation
While I’m not feeling particularly “unattached” to life

But you could counter, as you do,
That since you stole, I mean, won, the public trust
That you too are acting in self-defense
But it’s not the heat of the moment, you know damn well,
And you’ve been itchin’ for military action since the day you got in,
Pissing off China, Russia, Saddam, now this---
How fortuitious, the economy: weak, your ratings:
So-so; the tax cuts didn’t do it. Wag the dog, folks will rally.
An old, old story, which Shakespeare doth tally…

Even if you didn’t set them on, or know in advance
As some say Roosevelt did about Pearl Harbor,
Which, granted, doesn’t have anything on this,
But to the extent Hitler’s crimes were against humanity
Far more than property, you are not worthy
To lick Roosevelt’s boots.

Even if you didn’t set them on,
They were, as even the papers claim, CIA trained.
You can dish it out but you can’t take it
And this boomerang would be comic
If the chickens had truly come home to roost
And the hijacked planes would have only been filled
With masters of war, and some little bird
(illegal to feed in New York) would have warned
each and every innocent civilian away
from the towers and pentagon that Tuesday day.
It didn’t happen, but the only way you could save your skin
Was to get blood on your hands.

The enemy of my enemy may not be my friend,
And since I do not know their intentions
I cannot say if they missed their target,
All I know is that they missed MY target,
Which was not you so much as the forces
(would they were farces) who speak through you,
ignorant or evil I cannot say
and that maybe I need to rethink
my desire to see the market crash
to disrupt business as usual
for I cannot say I’m glad it’s happened
but wish we lived in a land
where the President wouldn’t have to wait
to his final speech to cop to the existence
of a military industrial complex,
where Kaczinski’s anti-tech and anti-war statements
could get on the cover of the New York Times
without him having to become his own enemy by killing,
and when I say we (or) you can dish it out but you can’t take it,
I don’t mean we should be ‘strong’ enough to keep taking it
As much as that we should use this opportunity
To stop dishing it out……

Hilton,

I wish your final two sentences weren't already proving so true.

Watching TV an hour or so ago, the Bush administration, speaking through
Colin Powell (you know, the "reasonable", "competent"-sounding member of
the cabinet) began the rollout on its retaliation plan.

In effect, we're being asked to write a blank check -- in terms of
economic, political, and most importantly mortal cost -- for a 3-5 year,
multi-regional "war" against enemies about whom we know only:

1) They are hard to define. (We've gone beyond looking for those
immediately responsible for the attack, beyond those who "harbor" them,
and we've now set our sights on anyone with a dimly-defined ideological
commitment to terror.)

2) They recruit persistently. ("Kill one head and two take its place."
Or, "Perhaps," thinks Lawrence Eagleburger, licking his piggish chops
for an audience he hopes appreciates his full historical gravity, "we
can build that permanent war economy we were always dreaming Santa would
leave under the White House Christmas tree." War communism helped
prepare the USSR for the transition from Lenin to Stalin -- apparently
we're about to test the hypothesis that "war capitalism" will pave the
way for... what? It can get worse?)

3) They are everywhere. (We'll finally get a chance to test our
"readiness" to fight a two-(or more)-front war, that mantra of the
militarist right in this country all through the "soft" Clinton
interregnum).

"Experts" on other channels immediately start rattling off the list of
possible targets: Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, the Palestinian Authority,
Syria. Even, and unbelievably, Saudi Arabia, the country whose rolling
over for a U.S. military occupation is one of the major causes of Osama
bin Laden's anti-U.S. animus. Powell himself has already gone past
talking about a war and is defining it as a "campaign," in effect a
protracted state of siege wherein "we" beset whatever states or
non-state organizations, anywhere in the world, who fit some nebulous
definition of "terrorist." This will not be a war, then, but a war made
of wars. "One, two, many Vietnams" indeed.

Leave it to our made-to-order President to evade the problem of "mission
creep" by giving us a mission pre-crept. My sense of sheer disbelief at
Tuesday's attack is almost matched, only two and a half days later. I
thought I was numb -- apparently I can still feel. The dissonance as I
try to think through the fiendish (il)logic of this "campaign" feels
like a swarm of angry bees between my ears. (Thinking back to the Dante
I was reading a few days ago, this semantic maneuver makes sense, of
course, since a campaign is simply "our" army _camped_ in "your"
_campagna_, buddy).

And I'm angry, most of all right now, that apparently the time to mourn
is over, and the time to resist well and fully upon us. Airport cops are
arresting more men with fake ID's and plastic knives, and I'm terrified,
but I know the Bush war will conjure more of them into being. The rescue
crews are trying to pull ten cops out of the basement of the WTC and I'm
crying with the anxiety, the possibility of some good news, even while
I'm so fucking angry I can't breathe.

Peace,
Taylor

Richard -- your response is exactly what every war-mongering hawk in this
country wants. It is extremely saddening to me &, I would think, to most if
not all people on this list and beyond. But not only saddening (there is
little room for sadness left, the many death of the recent days having taken
the lion's share of that emotion) -- your response is profoundly maddening,
anger-inducing for its blatant racism.  I do not have the leisure right now
to compose a long reply -- there are more urgent things to be taken care
of -- but I will paste a article by Nigel Parry s from the Intifada website
below, to show how wrong, misinformed & biased your comments really are. Two
days after the events, and while still mourning the dead in NYC, Washington
D.C. and Pennsylvania, it seems to me that what we as writers, poets,
intellectuals have to do most urgently is to try  to counter, to the best of
our possibility & with every mean at our disposal, the racist discourse of
jingoistic hate that is threatening to overwhelm this country and serve as
alibi for the US Government's military response. -- Pierre Joris

from today's edition of "The Electronic Intifada"
[http://electronicintifada.net/coveragetrends/rejoicing.html

The Palestinian people, as a whole, portrayed as supportive of the attacks
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon

Written by Nigel Parry

12 September 2001 -- Yesterday and today, following the inhumane use of
passenger planes as flying missiles to attack people visiting and working in
the World Trade Center buildings in New York and in the Pentagon in
Washington, most of the media broadcast footage depicting Palestinians
celebrating.

The brief footage was typically broadcast cyclically and used as an
interview aid, with anchors asking U.S. government officials and others how
they felt about the images.

Almost universally on U.S. networks, anchors presented the footage as if it
were representative of all Palestinians, additionally failing to note any
context to the images.

A number of points must be made, first about the actual footage:
There are three million Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and West Bank
including Jerusalem, one million Palestinians living inside the borders of
Israel, and another four million Palestinian refugees living elsewhere in
the world, including the United States. The footage in question depicted
between 20 and 40 individuals.


The Palestinians in the footage were mostly young children. Most of their
behaviour in the footage appeared to be no different from how Palestinian
children always behave when foreign journalists turn up in their towns,
crowding and smiling at the camera and giving the victory sign that has been
a symbol of Palestinian steadfastness under Israeli military occupation
since the first Intifada in 1987. There is not a single reporter with any
experience of carrying a camera into the Palestinian West Bank under any
circumstance who couldn't get similar footage on any day they visited the
occupied territories.


Where genuine rejoicing at the attacks was indeed apparent in the footage,
anchors interpreting the footage made no effort to offer any context or
background to the images, nor any attempt to separate those Palestinians
portrayed from Palestinians as a whole. A comparable situation would be
television anchors angrily reacting to scenes of the 1991 riots in Los
Angeles, lamenting that "blacks do not respect law and order", while failing
to note the preceding attack on Rodney King or endemic racial profiling of
the black community in the U.S. by police forces.


The overwhelming number of Palestinians, like people of all nationalities,
were sickened by the events in New York and Washington. Palestinians with
relatives in New York and Washington spent much of yesterday worriedly
trying to phone to check they were safe, exactly as many Americans did.
Palestinian citizens of the United States will also turn out to be among the
victims of the tragedy. Whatever a group of 20-40 Palestinian children
happened to be doing yesterday morning in Nablus or Ein Al-Hilweh Refugee
Camp in Lebanon is no more representative of all Palestinians than the Klu
Klux Klan rally -- which happened recently just down the road from where I
live, in St. Paul, Minnesota -- is representative of all Americans.


In addition, there is an all-important context of brutalisation -- that
anchors completely failed to note -- which explains why even a single person
would find any cause to celebrate yesterday's terrible carnage:

For the last year now, Palestinian civilians have been living through a
nightmare in which Israeli occupation forces have been nightly shelling
their towns using tanks, helicopters, and other heavy weapons. Palestinians
do not need a subscription to Jane's Defence Weekly to learn the origin of
these weapons when they can pick up shell casings from the floors of their
homes and from their backyards with MADE IN THE U.S.A. stamped on them.
United States weaponry supplied to Israel includes:
Heavy weapons:

F-16 fighter planes, Apache and Cobra attack helicopters, and Reshef patrol
boats to attack Palestinian buildings and vehicles; and

Armoured pile drivers and armoured bulldozers to destroy Palestinian homes
and agricultural land.


Heavy ammunition:

Naval and tank artillery including 76mm, 105mm and 120mm high explosive
rounds;
M114 TOW rockets and Hell-Fire air-to-ground missiles;
Shoulder-fired, anti-armour Light Anti-tank Weapons (LAW) rocket launchers
firing 84mm or 90mm rockets;
M203 and MK19 grenade launchers;
40-90 mm mortars; and

A modified version of the M494 105mm, an anti-personnel cluster bomb.


Smaller ammunition:

5.56 mm bullets for M-16 machine guns;
7.62 mm high velocity bullets for general purpose machine guns and Galil
sniper rifles;
12.7 mm bullets for Browning machine guns and Barret sniper rifles; and
The "less lethal" rubber-coated and plastic-coated metal bullets.
The U.S. weaponry listed above has not been used proportionally for the
purpose of defending Israel -- as one would hope any military aid is used --
but rather has been used disproportionally and offensively to kill over 600
Palestinians, one-third of whom are children, 60 percent of whom were killed
outside of clash situations. The U.S. weaponry listed above has additionally
been used to seriously injure another 15,000 Palestinians, 1,500 of whom
have been crippled for life. That Israel has used "excessive force" to
suppress the current Palestinian uprising against 34 years of its military
occupation is a fact according to the United Nations Security Council, other
UN bodies, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Israeli human rights
organisation B'Tselem, and the US State Department. However offensive the
images of the small groups of Palestinians that were celebrating may be, the
fact is that all those depicted in the images -- if they are under 34 years
of age -- have known nothing but military occupation for the entirity of
their lives. That celebration was the reaction of only a tiny minority of
people in such a situation is a testimony to the Palestinians' maintainance
of human values in a situation devoid of them.


Not only does the United States sell weapons and ammunition to Israel, but
many of these weapons are supplied as U.S. aid to Israel. A current figure
for U.S. aid currently given to Israel is $3 billion per year, which
includes $1.2 billion in economic aid and $1.8 billion in military aid. It
is difficult to offer this as a conclusive figure since additional money is
given to Israel that is buried in the budgets of individual government
agencies such as the Defense Department. Every Palestinian is aware that the
U.S. supplies the weapons that Israel uses against them. That celebration
was the reaction of only a tiny minority of people in such a situation is a
testimony to the Palestinians' maintainance of human values in a situation
devoid of them.


Every Palestinian is also aware that their television screens are never
filled with images of Americans protesting the use of their tax dollars to
pay for the missiles that shake their cities and create similarly
distressing scenes of injured and shocked civilians, as seen yesterday in
New York. That celebration was the reaction of only a tiny minority of
people in such a situation is a testimony to the Palestinians' maintainance
of human values in a situation devoid of them.
The U.S. media broadcast the footage yesterday without explaining any of the
above, something that is neither new nor -- any longer -- acceptable in
light of the anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab and the anti-Muslim sentiment it
creates. No organisation of journalists who seek to bring their viewers an
accurate representation of reality should be broadcasting contextless,
unrepresentative images that encourage racism against nationalities and
their associated ethnic groups.

In the first few days following the 1995 attack on the Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma, Arabs and Muslims in the U.S. reported more than 200
incidents of harassment, threats and actual violence. According to reports
received by The Electronic Intifada and a press release yesterday from the
Council on American-Islamic Relations there have already been reports of
harassment and attacks against Arabs and Muslims in the United States. Hate
mail and threats have also been directed at The Electronic Intifada and
other Palestinian, Arab and Muslim websites.

As those of us who live in the U.S. are currently feeling justifiable anger
at the perpetrators behind yesterday's shocking and horrifying events in New
York and Washington DC, let us not misdirect it at an entire people who
continue to suffer through one of the darkest periods of their already bleak
history. The Palestinian people, who sit glued to their television sets in
disturbed silence like the rest of the world, are actually better placed
than most to understand what those of us living in America currently feel
and are finding it hard to express.

Dear Poetix, I send out my love and hope to all of you -- even, yes, those
I've had tiffs with -- on this list, and am so grateful to hear from Brian
and Lisa and Lee Ann and others in NYC that you are ok.

I heard from Yedda Morrison, while sitting at lunch today under an SF sky
that for once surprised us with an airplane, that Rodrigo Toscano and Laura
Elrick were down near the events and saw it, Laura was working at a polling
place. They are ok.

I heard that my friend/fellow poet Sarah Anne Cox's brother lost friends and
coworkers. I heard that many of my friends in NYC, including the superb poet
and person Carol Mirakove, are ok, for which I am grateful.

When I said in my last post that we need poetry desperately, I meant we need
a place to negotiate and contemplate ambiguity. (George's "good and evil"
just don't work.)

While we were both at work today, my husband forwarded me an email about "a
view from canada" that perhaps some of you have seen. It was about what the
US has to be proud of and he may have sent it because he is very good at
making me question my firm beliefs. Which I am grateful for. I pray or
meditate (which I am better at) for all the dear Muslim and Arab American
people I interact with every day. They must be very scared, especially as
the reports come in from Dallas, etc. And not so recently what happened
right here and there to Japanese and German Americans. This is a frightful
time, and all I can do is hope for all of our common humanity.

My pride in being a US citizen stems from my belief that we are a country
(or citizenry) that is able, often just on the day-to-day level, to deal and
live with and respect our fellow citizens who have profoundly different
traditions (and lack thereofs) than ourselves.

I hope we can do that with our fellow earthlings.

All my good wishes to all of you.

xxxxx
Elizabeth

I have to say that I am heartened to hear something other than
jingoism coming from the AS. It is demoralizing to look at the TV as
we do, and see experienced news readers doing the usual flag waving

Last night, at Mitch Highfill & Kim Lyon's apartment, Nada, Sharon Mesmer,
David Borchardt & I at one point in the conversation were talking about
whether or not this was something we could or should write about. Nevermind
how, just whether or not it would be contributing to the general  deluge,
contributing to what has already become a media spectacle, whether or not we
might have anything to add.

There was really only one topic or general subject all night, and what most
struck me were the number of various anecdotes, first-person accounts, our
own and those heard from others, that we were all holding onto, and how much
each of us wanted both to hear and tell them. Nada said she felt it was like
some awful privilege to be so close to the events.

Mitch, who works across the street from the WTC, told us about someone in
his department who, when she heard the first plane hit and debris began to
rain down onto their building, reportedly shut her blinds and went back to
work. Mitch wasn't there; he goes in at 11 and was planning to vote before
going in, instead of sitting at the fountain outisde the WTC as he usually
did, writing. He was still in Brooklyn when it happened. He had to go pick
up his & Kim's son, Jackson, at his school in Caroll Gardens. The smoke was
so bad by the time he got there, both he and Jackson had wet towels to their
faces as they walked back to Park Slope. Mitch told the story of another
woman who worked at his office who described running from the scene,
literally having to leap over body parts, arms, human heads. I told the
story then that Greta from my office had told me about a friend of hers, who
was on the Staten Island Ferry as the planes hit and described seeing both
debris and body parts in the water.

I just now stepped out to get cigarettes and overheard one woman tell a
couple others outside the bodega: "You know how many countries *live* like
this?"

Adeena Karasick was taking her daughter, Safie, to school, when suddenly
Safie said: "Mommy, why is that plane flying so low?" She looked up and they
both watched it crash into the WTC. Later, Safie was building towers out of
straws, and knocking them down.

Sharon described hearing a pop outside her window, and then getting a call
from someone telling her what had happened. She woke up David and they both
went up to the roof, incredulous, to see what was going on across the river.
As Sharon watched through binoculars, the first of the two towers collapsed.
She took the binoculars from her face, completely shaken, unable to watch,
and just broke down sobbing.

Nada was at the deli today and talked with a guy whose uncle worked on the
89th floor, a nightshift worker. He'd taken his lunch break and was on the
elevator down when the plane hit. His hand was crushed, but otherwise was
okay.

I was at work on 46th Street, unable to do anything, having already heard on
the way in that one plane had crashed into the WTC, and then having been
told once I got there that two had done so. I was on the phone with Jordan
Davis, who works across the street from me, checking in, when Greta came in
and told me that another plane had struck the Pentagon. I told Jordon this
... there was a long pause ... and then he just said: "I have to ... make
some calls ..." and we hung up.

Everyone in my office assumed the U.N. was next. My first thought was to get
to Central Park. Outside, there were already streams of people moving up
Third Avenue, more people than I've seen even at rush hour. It was like that
for two hours, at least.

I stuck around, as did most of us in the office, completely unable to decide
what we should do. By that time, we'd gotten reports that all the subways
and bridges were closed. We watched the second tower collapse on the only
channel that seemed to work, 2. At some point, after having gotten in
contact with Nada, Mitch and Jack Kimball (and having left messages with or
tried various others w/out success), I checked my email, and saw one from
Sue Landers, who works down the street from me. "You OK?" I called her, got
through, and we began to talk about some plan for getting off Manhattan. I
guess that took about an hour, as she had to call various others. We decided
to convene outside her work, and then walk down to the Williamsburg Bridge,
which by that time was reportedly open to foot traffic.

We met Ethan Fugate and a co-worker of Sue's whose name I can't remember,
and started walking down towards the Poetry Project, where we were going to
meet up with Allison Cobb, Jen Coleman, and Sue's girlfriend Natasha. Either
Sue or Ethan told me about Allison's experience: She had been on a train
stopped at the Rector Street station, which is just southeast of the WTC,
when the first plane hit. Apparently, the whole train shook, debris and
smoke filled the tunnel, and everyone rushed out onto the platform, assuming
the tunnel was on fire. Allison looked out and could see blue sky and
thought that it would be okay to go outside. I don't know anymore than that
she just started walking north once she was outside until she got to work.

We met the others at the Project and then walked down to Houston to see
about getting an F train back to Park Slope. Rumors had it that the F was
running. It was, but was so crowded, we ultimately left the station and went
with our original plan to cross the Williamsburg Bridge.

This was probably the scene that will stay with me longest ... walking
across the bridge with hundreds of others, very slowly, turning back every
now and then to see the skyline of downtown Manhattan, a huge plume of smoke
rising from where the WTC had been. Above us, the occasional J train was
creeping along, every passenger's face pressed to the window. When we got to
the other side, descending down into Brooklyn, there were about 40-50
Hasidic Jews waiting there with cups of water, which they silently handed
each of us as we walked into Brooklyn. Very few words were exchanged except
"thank you"s. We asked around about busses, and found one.

On the bus we crept along down the street by the Navy yard, which was now
filled with armed men & women. Sue and I suddenly saw that Jenny Smith, who
used to work at the Project, was on the bus, so Sue, who was closer, went to
go talk with her. She was going to give blood--though, by that time, so many
were already doing so, she was no doubt turned away.

We got off in downtown Brooklyn, which was by now filled with smoke. You
could see thousands of pieces of paper above our heads. People were
streaming off the Brooklyn Bridge. There were cops everywhere. It still
hadn't really registered with me what had happened.

Even talking, the next evening, with everyone at Mitch & Kim's, it was still
not something any of us seemed to be able to fully grasp. After Jackson went
to bed, Kim pulled out the NY Times, and we looked through the paper, the
huge blown up photographs. Everything looked unreal to me, like a Hollywood
set, except for one shot of one of the towers, where you could see people
standing there in the windows. That hit me. What must have been going
through their minds. That it was a nightmare. Then, no, that it was real,
and there was no way out. I can't imagine the adrenaline rush those people
were experiencing, though I was certainly projecting. I remembered from
being in a subway fire this feeling you have when you assume you're going to
die, and it's not even a full thought; it's more just this rush, and your
only thought is how awful it's going to be for the people who knew you to
find this out, like if there were only some way to let them know that it's
okay, everyone dies, but realizing they won't feel that, they'll just be
filled with this awful sadness and horror, all of their fears and sentiments
funneled into this one point of black, empty focus. But mostly it's an
intense adrenaline rush that you can't even describe as fear, although I
guess that's what it is. I'm guessing or projecting that thousands of people
were experiencing something like that at one moment. I can't stop thinking
of that.

Mitch said, and everyone agreed, that the most potent images from the media
have been the people waiting to hear about their relatives or loved ones.
Holding up their pictures. Every time that comes on--and it does
frequently--I can feel I'm close to losing it.

Tuesday night, the smell of smoke was thick in our apartment. Wednesday,
when I went into work, and the wind had changed, it was thick in our
building, all the way up on 46th Street. Tod Thilleman said he was walking
in Prospect Park Tuesday night and that it was filled with burnt paper. At
Mitch & Kim's, they had three pieces of paper, stapled together, that had
blown onto their window sill. You could smell the smoke on it.

Down our block a few doors is the fire station, where across the street, our
neighbors have hung a huge banner, where everyone has written something.
Beneath that are candles. In the opposite direction, up the block, two doors
down on the corner, is Junior's Market, run by two Palestinians. There's a
Syrian guy who hangs out there & whose wife, who's from Holland, works the
register when the two friends are away. He came to our stoop sale a month
ago and bought some middle eastern tapes and a couple of comic books from
me, asking where I'd found the tapes. Nada talked with him today, and he and
his wife are moving back to Holland as soon as they can get out. They're
completely freaked out, feel totally unsafe here. Nada, who assumed the two
friends who run the place were from Palestine (because they have a box for
money for needy children in the "holy land"), asked the Syrian guy where the
two friends were from, and the Syrian confirmed that they were from
Palestine. Nada asked if they'd been harrassed in the last couple of days.
He was too freaked out to answer her, so Nada assumed that if they hadn't
been, they were at the least worried about it. Mitch told us last night that
he'd been walking near Atlantic Avenue, where there's a long strip of arabic
shops, and that he'd overheard a group of construction workers who turned
onto Atlantic talking about "Fucking up some sand niggers."

I saw on the news tonight coverage of a candlelight vigile somewhere, and
the reporter asked the 11-year-old cousin of a man who has most likely died
in the WTC collapse what he's learned, and he said "That it's okay to hate."
Maybe it was my exhaustion & I misheard him.

I dont know what the fuck to think.My initial reaction was irrational: went
"mad" even though I'm not an American. Calm down Richard. This is too early
for me to be raving on. I'm not behind Bush and all the jerks in the White
house: but I've got to calm down. Got to think about all this. War of any
kind is not the answer. everyone has to think deeply about these issues.
Debate these issues: calmly if possible. What's going - gone on?  Avoid
getting "seduced" by television propaganda and the emotion: the hysteria. .

***************************************************
America: The Good Neighbor.

Widespread but only partial news coverage was given
recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from
Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television
commentator. What follows is the full text of his
trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record:

"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the
Americans as the most generous and possibly the least
appreciated people on all the earth.

Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and
Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the
Americans who poured in billions of dollars and
forgave other billions in debts. None of these
countries is today paying even the interest on its
remaining debts to the United States.

When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956,
it was the Americans who propped it up, and their
reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets
of Paris. I was there. I saw it.

When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the
United States that hurries in to help. This spring, 59
American communities were flattened by tornadoes.
Nobody helped.

The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped
billions of dollars! into discouraged countries. Now
newspapers in those countries are writing about the
decadent, warmongering Americans.

I'd like to see just one of those countries that
is gloating over the erosion of the United States
dollar build its own airplane. Does any other country
in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo
Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10?
If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all the
International lines except Russia fly American Planes?

Why does no other land on earth even consider putting
a man or woman on the moon? You talk about Japanese
technocracy, and you get radios. You talk about German
technocracy, and you get automobiles.

You talk about American technocracy, and you find
men on the moon -! not once, but several times -
and safely home again.

You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs
right in the store window for everybody to look at.
Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded.
They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless
they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American
dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.

When the railways of France, Germany and India
were breaking down through age, it was the Americans
who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and
the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an
old caboose. Both are still broke.

I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced
to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name
me even one time when someone else raced to the
Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside
help even during the San Francisco earthquake.

Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one
Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get
kicked around. They will come out of this thing with
their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled
to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating
over their present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of
those."

Stand proud, America!


Please forward this e-mail to your friends and family.

Sincerely,
The Staff

MIME-Version: 1.0

I'm checking in here. I've heard from or of NYC poets who are OK as well:
Brenda Coultas, Eleni Sikelianos, Anselm Berrigan, Eddie Berrigan, Karen
Weiser, Brendan Lorber, John Godfrey (saw him last night at a restaurant),
Kim Lyons, Mitch Highfill, Joe Elliot & family.

Kim Lyons told me that it seems that talking about the event over and over
again as close to it as possible helps with post-traumatic stress syndrome,
so I guess we should tell our stories.

I just have fragments: it's raining, and the long thunder rolls followed by
explosions last night sounded like an airfight. Yesterday, we went into my
mother's loft on Chambers St., 7 blocks from the WTC, which she had left in
a panic, running north with hundreds of others. Her below-code building,
already tilting alarmingly, seemed ready to collapse with us in it. Inside,
everything coated with fine dust. Noticing later our hair stiff with it. She
had been leaving her place to go the farmer's market at the WTC when the
first plane hit. Everyone has close call stories--or is thinking of the last
time they were in or near the WTC, or how they almost worked there once, or
passed through the Concourse for one reason or another. Rich had just
hand-delivered an application for a studio program there, Thundergulch. I
wonder if any painters had been in their studios.

We looked down West Broadway when we got out & saw yet another building that
had slid down to the ground--I think it may have been the old WPA post
office, but am not sure. I just can't believe it would be--it was so solid.
I grew up about 10 blocks from the WTC. It's going to be so strange not to
see the familiar buildings. Century 21 was my favorite department
store--it's now crushed. More residents passed by us, masks on their faces,
or hankerchiefs, dragging carts, suitcases and pets. Kathryn Freed, one of
the candidates for NYC Public Advocate passed us. I guess she lives down
there too. It reminded me how I had voted Tuesday morning 10 minutes before
the first plane, feeling great to be voting for a new mayor, participating
in NYC civic life, happy about the candidates, happy about a gorgeous Sept
day in NYC.

On my way to work yesterday, saw graffiti on a bus stop: "Bomb all Muslim
businesses." I'm relieved with the rain today--maybe it will wash the
graffiti off, down to the sewer where it belongs, although I feel bad about
how tough the rain must be for the rescue workers. But it will also wash
away some of this horrible yellow-beige dust, and put out the rest of the
fires, and dampen this toxic smoke, which has been changing direction
constantly with the wind.  Like so many other New Yorkers, right after the
towers collapsed, we walked and walked and walked. The streets were packed
with people walking. We walked to St. Vincent's hospital to give blood.
Dozens of doctors were waiting outside with empty gurneys, waiting for the
ambulances to arrive. We passed a reporter and cameraman--the reporter said,
"Try to find a distraught family."

People at work were jumpy, almost hysterical, yesterday. We're five blocks
from Grand Central, bomb threats there. I ran into Brendan Lorber later; he
had been evacuated from Rockefeller Center and sent home. Bosses here talk
about "maintaining routine" and "showing 'them.'" Midtown was a nightmare of
traffic, smoke, sirens. I walked home, and passed secret service agents on a
quiet block. I guess maybe Bush came a day early, or some bigwig. I just got
an e-mail saying that we were supposed to wear red, white and blue today to
work--how bizarre. Today seems a tiny smidgen easier--I slept without waking
up with the total horrors in the middle of the night.

love,
Marcella

Hi All,
This is Brenda Coultas checking in, since the tragedy I have spoken with
poets, Marcella Durand, Brendan Lorber, David Cameron,  Jo Ann Wasserman,
Edwin Torres and Liz Castagna, Laird Hunt and Eleni Sikelianos, Marcella Harb
and John Wright, Jeni Olin, Diana Ricard. All are fine.

I haven't heard of any poets being lost although I'm sure some poets may have
lost someone and I have heard there were some close calls,  but I'll let
those poets tell their own stories.

Thank you all for being with us, knowing that your thoughts are with us is
very comforting.

love,
Brenda Coultas

There was a story on the local evening news the night of the attack that =
people were flocking to their churches to pray for the victims, peace, =
revenge, or whatever.
It stuck me how this is a war between religious ideologies, just like so =
much of human violence has been throughout our history. Monotheism: My =
God against your God; or, My God is the only God. =20
Whether here, in a country that prides itself on having more churches =
than any in the world, or in Israel, Islamic countries,  Ireland, =
Yugoslavia...as long as there are self-serving belief-systems, that =
cloak themselves in religions, or otherwise (Capitalism, Communism...), =
even when there are people within them who mean well, which there are on =
all sides--there will be violence.=20
I'm not speaking about spirituality, which has a cosmic view of reality, =
but belief-systems. And it seems to me that as poets this is something =
to listen for, on the news and in ourselves, as we interpret this =
tragedy. =20

A friend and I were discussing this poem by Auden this week. I think it has
a lot to say to this moment.
Good, sane and measured thoughts to you all,
Andrew

***

September 1, 1939
W. H. Auden

I sit in one of the dives
On Fifty-second Street
Uncertain and afraid
As the clever hopes expire
Of a low dishonest decade:
Waves of anger and fear
Circulate over the bright
And darkened lands of the earth,
Obsessing our private lives;
The unmentionable odour of death
Offends the September night.
Accurate scholarship can
Unearth the whole offence
From Luther until now
That has driven a culture mad,
Find what occurred at Linz,
What huge imago made
A psychopathic god:
I and the public know
What all schoolchildren learn,
Those to whom evil is done
Do evil in return.
Exiled Thucydides knew
All that a speech can say
About Democracy,
And what dictators do,
The elderly rubbish they talk
To an apathetic grave;
Analysed all in his book,
The enlightenment driven away,
The habit-forming pain,
Mismanagement and grief:
We must suffer them all again.
Into this neutral air
Where blind skyscrapers use
Their full height to proclaim
The strength of Collective Man,
Each language pours its vain
Competitive excuse:
But who can live for long
In an euphoric dream;
Out of the mirror they stare,
Imperialism's face
And the international wrong.
Faces along the bar
Cling to their average day:
The lights must never go out,
The music must always play,
All the conventions conspire
To make this fort assume
The furniture of home;
Lest we should see where we are,
Lost in a haunted wood,
Children afraid of the night
Who have never been happy or good.
The windiest militant trash
Important Persons shout
Is not so crude as our wish:
What mad Nijinsky wrote
About Diaghilev
Is true of the normal heart;
For the error bred in the bone
Of each woman and each man
Craves what it cannot have,
Not universal love
But to be loved alone.
From the conservative dark
Into the ethical life
The dense commuters come,
Repeating their morning vow;
"I will be true to the wife,
I'll concentrate more on my work,"
And helpless governors wake
To resume their compulsory game:
Who can release them now,
Who can reach the deaf,
Who can speak for the dumb?
All I have is a voice
To undo the folded lie,
The romantic lie in the brain
Of the sensual man-in-the-street
And the lie of Authority
Whose buildings grope the sky:
There is no such thing as the State
And no one exists alone;
Hunger allows no choice
To the citizen or the police;
We must love one another or die.
Defenceless under the night
Our world in stupor lies;
Yet, dotted everywhere,
Ironic points of light
Flash out wherever the Just
Exchange their messages:
May I, composed like them
Of Eros and of dust,
Beleaguered by the same
Negation and despair,
Show an affirming flame.

Brilliant?  And just what did it accomplish for the anti-capitalism?
(Even if it turns out to have been orchestrated by anti-capitalists,
which is unlikely.)  How was it more "brilliant" for anti-capitalism
than McVeigh's idiocy was for anti-Renoism, or whatever it was he
thought he was opposing?

This was written a few years ago, but today (9/13) it seems
pertinent in new ways.

Hal



In Memoriam: Luigi Nono

                "Caminante, no hay caminos, hay que caminar."
                                   —Inscription on the wall of a cloister in Toledo

1.
Traveler, there are no roads,
but we must go. No voices speak to us
from the clouds, and yet we must
listen. I seek you out

in Venice, but you have already left
the city. I reach you by phone
in Berlin, and we agree
on a time and a place to meet.

In the meantime, I explore this city of waters,
I walk the canals and bridges, I inspect
the market squares. I look for
Tintorettos and for pieces

of your childhood here. I seek
you out, but you have already left.
The roads and ways are deserted, the canals
and bridges are empty of people.

I must go to meet you, but there is no
way to go. The overtones of our
conversations hang in the air like something
too private for words. Too spontaneous,

yet binding. Tintoretto, Schnittke, Webern—
the names wander in and out of our conversation.
I am attracted and repelled by you, I speak
and you are silent, I walk and you stand still.


2.              "He showed me into one of his rooms."

I tried to decipher his letters. Outside, Freiburg
Sweltered—the last days of summer. He made
demands on me I felt I could not possibly meet.
He expected some sort of ideal human being.

It was the beginning, he announced. And he
wanted to move on from there. He wanted to work
on the continuation. The overtones of our talk,
a word here, a word there—hints that I could not reckon.

"Don't get excited." He tapped his forehead. "I've
got it all here." My fear and anxiety heightened.
The concert was a day away. The bridge, the canals—
all empty of people.

3.              "To travel is the goal."

Now he is dead, and I feel a need to do something,
something in honor of his memory. I feel the words
coming back to me, overlapping, moving away from
each other, losing each other, coming back, disappearing,
overlapping, disappearing again.

I feel the sounds, the dreams, moving outward along
as yet undisclosed highways, moving toward—well,
there is nowhere to go, but go we must. We must
play, as if there's some underlying order to our
discomfitures, highways and byways of stars.

My wing is ready for flight,
I would like to turn back.
If I stayed timeless time,
I would have little luck.

                   Gerhard Scholem, "Gruss vom Angelus"

A Klee painting named "Angelus Novus" shows an angel looking as though he
is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating.  His
eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread.  This is how
one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past.
Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which
keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The
angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been
smashed.  But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his
wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. This
storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back turned,
while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we
call progress.

Hi -

The Chinese Room is philosopher John Searle's response to the theory of
Strong AI.

Strong AI holds that "different material structures can be mentally
equivalent if they are different hardware implementations of the same
computer program.  Therefore the mind is just a computer program and the
brain is one of the indefinite range of different computer hardwares (or
"wetwares") that can have a mind." (Searle, 43-44)

John Searle attempted to specifically discard the claim that "the mind is
just a computer program" with his Chinese Room counterexample.  He does not
use this example to argue if the brain can be a digital computer or if the
brain can be simulated with a digital computer.

The Chinese room "showed that a system could instantiate a program so as to
give a perfect simulation of some human cognitive capacity, such as the
capacity to understand Chinese, even though that system had no understanding
of Chinese whatsoever....neither the person inside nor any other part of the
system literally understands Chinese....Because the program is purely formal
of syntactical and because minds have mental or semantic contents, any
attempt to produce a mind purely with computer programs leaves out the
essential features of the mind." (Searle, 45)  "The formal syntax of the
program does not by itself guarantee the presence of mental contents."
(Searle, 200)

Searle's Chinese Room thought experiment is specifically intended for the
very specific claim that the "mind is just a computer program."  His thought
experiment is thoroughly effective in dispelling strong AI.  It is solely a
negative thesis and so says little if nothing about what the nature of mind
is.  Searle did not intend the counterexample to be used otherwise.

"WR Grace Asbestos containing insulation was used at the World Trade Center

Unfortunately this was not true this material was 2-5 percent asbestos.
100,000 80 pound bags of this vermiculite was used in the WTC. In addition
9,150 pounds of MonoKote 3 was used at the WTC. Monokote 3 was about 20
percent asbestos. Therefore in total about 201,183 pounds of pure asbestos
fiber from Grace was used in the WTC."

Unfortunately, Grace was not the only supplier:

"Chalk up one victory for insurers in the escalating asbestos-claims mOlOe:
the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey has lost a 10-year-old court
battle to get its insurers to pay more than $600 million for removing
asbestos from its properties, including the World Trade Center and New
York's airports. The judge ruled that asbestos abatement costs by themselve=
s
do not constitute 'physical loss or damage' under the Port Authority's
all-risk policies. The agency is considering an appeal." [emphasis mine]

[interesting overview on asbestos problem]
Copyright 1989 by The American Spectator
"Coming soon to a school or office near you: a life-saving innovation that
could kill you, designed to correct a problem that doesn't exist, by
removing materials that aren't dangerous until somebody tries to remove
them. And guess who's going to pay for it." ... "For example, the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey is expecting to pay about $1 billion
for the abatement of just the World Trade Center and LaGuardia Airport. (Ne=
w
York City law requires abatement if renovation work is being done, as it is
at these buildings.) ..."

Based on this information, it can be said with reasonable certainty that
several tons of asbestos were in the World Trade Center. With the dust of
the WTC now clouding the city, contamination is very likely, but measurings
of the dust should be taken before jumping to any conclusions. After my
search, some news media started to mention the asbestos issue, mostly this
ABCNews article which states that

The Trade Center reportedly decided more than 10 years ago to treat the
health risk by encapsulating the asbestos to prevent the particles from
being inhaled.=20

To my knowledge, "encapsulating" means that the asbestos fibers are simply
painted over, or that asbestos-covered shafts are sealed, to avoid direct
human contact and air contamination. With both WTC towers destroyed, this
"encapsulation" is of no relevance. What matters is the degree of
asbestos-contamination which is now in New York City. As school is supposed
to begin again tomorrow, this problem should be addressed as soon as
possible. Residents of NYC should stay in their homes, keep their windows
closed and shut down the air conditioning (the filters won't work on the
fiber)."

Based on the tonnage, this journalist calculates about 3 fibers per cubic
centimeter of air in lower Manhattan or downwind of ground zero; while the
EPA calculted only .0048 fibers per cc.  However, note also the ambiguous
reportage of much higher concentrations:

"Analysis of earlier air samples taken downwind of the attack site in
Brooklyn on Tuesday also showed lead, asbestos and volatile organic
compounds to be undetectable or at low levels of concern. The air samples
showed 0.0048 fibers of asbestos per cubic centimeter, below the level of
0.1 fibers per cubic centimeter Occupational Safety and Health
Administration standard for airborne exposure in office buildings, accordin=
g
to the EPA.

In addition, three dust samples collected Tuesday at the collapse site and
others collected Wednesday showed low or nondetectable levels of asbestos.

=8CDon=B9t Be Stupid=B9 =8B Protect Yourself

However, one dust sample collected Tuesday showed an elevated level of
asbestos, so the EPA is recommending wetting down debris to prevent
dissipation of dust into the air. Officials add that workers stirring up as=
h
and debris should wear respiratory masks and protective gear.

It's "one of those cases of 'don't be stupid,'" EPA spokeswoman Tina
Kreisher said. "If there's a chance, why not put on the mask?"

ABCNEWS Medical Editor Dr. Timothy Johnson said today on Good Morning
America that the air and dust measurements, the odor and evident dust in th=
e
air indicate that very young children, the elderly and people with asthma
should stay away from the attack area, and workers should take precautions.

"I see people walking around without masks and I think that is foolhardy,"
Johnson said."

Hi folks,

I spent most of yesterday biking through Manhattan.  Managed to get below
14th street, which the news said was off-limits to non-residents.  This
didn't turn out to be true -- subway stations were open on 8th and Bleecker,
and they weren't checking IDs up on Avenue C.  Couldn't get past Houston
though, and there was another series of checkpoints at Canal -- below Canal
is all relief workers, some military, etc.

Houston St: almost no traffic, of course, yellow police tape everywhere --
in one park, I had seen a free dance performance on the basketball courts
only last weekend -- trucks of all sorts parked up and down the street.  I
didn't smell anything until I got to Allen St, still several blocks east of
Broadway.  It was quite pungent, and burned the eyes a bit -- I can't
imagine what it's like further South.

Getting down west, near the river, where much of the traffic into and out of
"ground zero" is, and I saw small groups of people cheering on the workers
as they left and arrived.  It's the kind of thing I never would have thought
to do myself, but I appreciated their efforts (got a bit teary-eyed, which
is standard for me these days), as any sort of distraction, any sort of even
absurd gesture of love and respect, is valuable for these people.  I wanted
to mention, for my Canadian friends, a certain "Stoned Gloves" moment as I
rode around and saw discarded face-masks on the ground, trampled over,
collecting dust.  I picked up a sign that said "Thank You!" on it, written
in magic marker on an Evian bottled water box, and put it in my bag.

I left the area, was thinking of going by the Javitts center but thought
instead of lunch to regroup, watch some tv, and get over this nauseous
feeling I had.  Also, my glucose meter had died the day before, so I hadn't
been able to test my blood sugars for over a day -- wanted to relax a bit
and see if I could suss it out myself (diabetics do that, or think they do).

(Later, I called the company that makes the meter to have them send me
another one, and stupidly got upset when they said it wouldn't arrive for a
week -- duh, no airplanes.)

Went by my office at CUNY, discovered to my shock that everyone there waited
until they "got the email at 2:30" before leaving.  I know we weren't in any
danger on 34th Street, but nonetheless I don't know how people just go back
to their jobs when something like this happens.  All the more, it reminded
me of those people in the buildings that were told to go back up to their
offices after the first plane hit -- I'm sure this is a moment that's run
through everyone's mind.

Spent the afternoon with my sisters in Brooklyn.  My sister's boyfriend,
bright as he is, is a bit flaky (don't tell her I said that) so I watched
him playing with a toy helicopter for a few moments with a rather innocent
glee until I had to leave.  My sister's pregnant -- she's due in December.

Made several phone calls.  Heard the news that Kevin Davies, who works about
a block from where the towers were, was close enough to feel the shocks of
the second plane, and was walking across the Brooklyn Bridge when the first
tower collapsed.  Was heartened to hear that several of the folks he was
with on the bridge were from the first tower -- I just hope the final number
of people "missing" is far lower than the estimated number of people in the
building.

Met up with Alan Gilbert and Kristin Prevallet at a bar.  Our thoughts can't
get away from what we've seen -- Alan relating to me that they played the
national anthem in Britain during the changing of the guard, that it was the
second time he cried watching tv (the first being when he saw the first
tower fall) -- both of us speculating why this seems so meaningful to us now
even as we discuss (I didn't know this) that Bin Laden himself was trained
by Americans to fight the Soviets.  One in a long list of American "allies"
turned enemies.

And the shock of seeing lightning in the sky at about 1 am, not believing
that the weather, after so many days of just utter clarity, could turn to
rain.  Remembering that what they are asking for most for the workers, just
hours earlier, was for donations of socks and underwear.  It really started
pouring in about a half hour.  There seems some additional cruelty to this
choreography of the weather.

I suppose, after being in Manhattan again, the strangeness of it all is
leaving.  Stores are opening up, and up by 34th it almost seemed like just
another day.  (That is, except for the police directing traffic on every
corner, and nearly getting run over periodically by trucks or police cars
that seem to come from nowhere.)  I saw one young woman walking around 23rd
street crying, still walking with some sort of determination to get where
she's going but still looking lost.  Remarked also to myself "well, they
didn't get the Flat Iron" -- a building that, though it is not tall, cuts a
sharp figure against the sky. But everybody's rattled -- once you start
talking, reflecting, it all comes back quite strongly.

So now thinking of what comes next.  It seems we all need our
"foundations" -- whatever set of beliefs they are -- to act responsibly in
the future.  Hard to believe that this is just a prelude to what will be a
terrible time for everyone around the world, and to consider that this "day
of remembrance" is something of a luxury that the Americans have always had
not having hostile borders.  Not that I'm complaining, but (for example)
when the Korean War first started when my mother was six, there was no such
thing.  She and her family just started walking -- couldn't even go to her
room.

I hope, as poets, that we find a way to participate in some way in using the
things we have been thinking about -- on this list, in the poems, concerning
community, justice, globalization, etc. -- in a good way.

Kristin told me that she had just returned from an Eileen Myles reading at
Pratt.  Eileen didn't read poems, but talked off the top of her about
things -- the symbol of the flag, what her day might have been like,
strangeness of the clear weather etc. -- which Kristin said was incredible.
I speculated that a good "New York School" poet -- in the best "meditations
in an emergency" tradition -- are always keeping some record of the minor
events of their days, somehow finding value and beauty in even the most
trivial aspects of life, holding them against the hugeness of historical
(often bad) events.  It's a strength and a weakness, but nonetheless much
more a strength in these times.

I left my bicycle out in the rain last night -- I usually bring it in but
got lazy.  This morning, I discovered someone tried to steal it -- the
rubber around the chain was cut through.  Someone spent a lot of time doing
this -- who knows, might have just stopped hearing the door on my building
open.  In a bizarre way it's comforting to think people still have
ambitions, but I'm very happy they didn't get it.

Thanks again for emails you have sent.  Just wanted to give you something to
read, hope you don't mind.

love
Brian

Thanks to Charles and others for the continuing reports from the city.  We here in the outer reaches are watching, praying, phoning, giving blood.

This is from the first section of H.D.'s _Trilogy_, in fact from the first section of "The Walls do Not Fall," written during or shortly after the London Blitz:

     there, as here, ruin opens
     the tomb, the temple; enter,
     there as here, there are no doors:

     the shrine lies open to the sky,
     the rain falls, here, there
     sand drifts; eternity endures;

     ruin everywhere, yet as the fallen roof
     leaves the sealed room
     open to the air,

     so, through our desolation,
     thoughts stir, inspiration stalks us
     through gloom:

     unaware, Spirit announces the Presence;
     shivering overtakes us,
     as of old, Samuel:

     trembling at a known street-corner
     we know not nor are known:
     the Pythian pronounces -- we pass on

     to another cellar, to another sliced wall
     where poor utensils show
     like rare objects in a museum;

     Pompeii has nothing to teach us,
     we know crack of volcanic fissure,
     show flow of terrible lava,

     pressure on heart, lungs, the brain
     about to burst in its brittle case
     (what the skull can endure!):

     over us, Apocryphal fire,
     under us, the earth sway, dip of a floor,
     slope of a pavement

     where men roll, drunk
     with a new bewilderment,
     sorcery, bedevilment:

     the bone-frame was made for
     no such shock knit within terror,
     yet the skeleton stood up to it:

     the flesh? it was melted away,
     the heart burnst out, dead ember,
     tendons, muscles shattered, outer husk dismembered,

     yet the frame held:
     we passed the flame: we wonder
     what saved us?  what for?

   You want surrealism?  I offer you the email I got telling me how to log

*********

   We have been advised by OASAM that timesheets should reflect the
following:

1.  For persons who reported to work yesterday (Sept. 11, 2001), timesheets
should reflect administrative leave for the time during and after
evacuation/closing of government offices.

2.  For persons who reported to work yesterday, their timesheets should
reflect no more than a total of 8 hours of combined administrative leave and
time at work.

3.  For persons who were on leave yesterday, their timesheets should reflect
the type of leave taken.

4.  For persons who were on travel status and were unable to get home,
travel authorizations need to be modified to cover per diem costs associated
with the extended stay.  Time on travel should be accounted for in the same
way as all travel time is recorded.  Modified travel authorizations will
serve as the record for attendance in lieu of a sign-in sheet.

5.  Supervisors should note the sign-in sheet that the building was
evacuated and closed.  This will explain the lack of sign out times if/when
there is a timesheet audit.

If you have questions that are not addressed here, please let me know.

The Dream Before
(for Walter Benjamin)

Hansel and Gretel are alive and well
And they're living in Berlin
She is a cocktail waitress
He had a part in a Fassbinder film
And they sit around at night now
drinking schnapps and gin
And she says: Hansel, you're really bringing me down
And he says: Gretel, you can really be a bitch
He says: I've wasted my life on our stupid legend
When my one and only love
was the wicked witch.

She said: What is history?
And he said: History is an angel
being blown backwards into the future
He said: History is a pile of debris
And the angel wants to go back and fix things
To repair the things that have been broken
But there is a storm blowing from Paradise
And the storm keeps blowing the angel
backwards into the future
And this storm, this storm
is called
Progress

 - Laurie Anderson

i too am deeply disturbed by the (christian, religious) hawkishness
being voiced by our leaders and by so many of my fellow citizens here
in the dear old u.s. of a...

at the same time, i'm wondering if my friends here on the left (b/c
i'm sure that's where i stand) might offer what they think the
u.s./international community ought actually to *do* at the moment,
practically speaking... i see the language of manhunts (e.g.) far
more appropriate to the aims of social justice than any talk of war
or bombing or some other absurdity...

and that said, i see the language of pure nonviolence (the pure
language of nonviolence?) something of a (liberal) cop-out, given
what's happened and what's been happening on this planet for so long
now... and in fact, to suggest we "do nothing" perhaps supports an
isolationist agenda (with which latter i want to have nothing
whatever to do mself)... yes, critique, yes, cool-headedness (and
passion!), yes, violence is bad... but anarchistic sentiment
alone?... appeals to our better angels alone?...

hardly...

so:  can we on the left have an actual impact on policy---for once
(in a long while), *while* it's happening?... by e.g. putting our
names beside an anti-terrorism (as in, apprehend the criminals)
agenda, an agenda that approaches these torments from a truly
international-cosmopolitan ethical-political perspective (with the
u.s. held every bit as culpable as any other group/nation)?...

apologies for the speculative (provocative?) nature of my remarks,
given current urgencies and emotions and heartbreaks... but i must
admit, i grow rather weary of ideological critique, given the
stakes... i don't like it, not one damn bit, that the right is
controlling this (public) discourse, and i don't believe that
wringing "our" hands as to the violent nature of human nature
(nothing against hand-wringing per se, as i am doing my share of it,
believe me) is enough... in all, i think it's up to the left to
propose a workable response---incl. all efforts at diplomacy, sure,
but also (dare i say it?) the threat of (international, which
probably means military) police action, if necessary, and the full
application of a justice system to deal with any & all culprits...

or am i entirely wrongheaded?...

peace, & hoping for the best--

Joel:

What do you believe?  Do you believe your beliefs in a non-systematic way?
Are you non-ideological?

Who are you? Are there other people like you?  Do they share your
anti-systematic views?

I trust that you mean well, but are your claims about religion and violence
exclusive claims?  Would you defend them?

Are any ideas worth defending?

Struggling to find up-to-date information on bin Laden, I thought I'd =
ask for suggestions and share what I've found so far.=20

This is a realplayer statement issued by phone from Gore Vidal, mostly =
in English with curious translations of his blunt style into fairly =
formal Italian.  He argues that the US is falling into Bin Laden's trap =
if it pursues a prolonged retaliation.

http://www.radio.rai.it/radio3/

It is not quite as good as his essay in  the current issue of Vanity =
Fair in which he really goes into issues of terror, civil liberties, and =
the role the media plays in terrorist crisis.  I haven't seen anything =
as clearly thought out about the difference in propaganda between a =
media working against terror and not against a state.  I really can't =
recommend the essay enough. =20

For information on the bin Laden's connection to the CIA, try "The =
Eminence Grise" chapter of THE NEW JACKALS by Simone Reeve.  This book =
is also good on the real relationship (investments, influence) bin Laden =
has with his harboring state of Afganistan.  His relationship to Saddam =
Hussein.  The author is surprisingly fair in characterizing bin Laden's =
political stance. =20

 I'm also looking for z-net type info, statements like Chomsky's that =
came out right away...any positions which manage to situate the current =
situation against our actions in the Sudan, for example, while =
SIMULTANEOUSLY not denigrating the very real tragedy. =20

I also like Jeff Sommers "Blowback" on Z-net.

Subject: Re: a short essay


It has always seemed to me that there were simple, demonstrably true statements to be made.and, from an early age, I poked around in my head looking for them.

That it isn't possible to take pride in anything you were born with - that seemed clear. The almost class-distinctions made between a good athlete, say, and a good thinker, or artist, struck me as stupid and dishonest, even though I would have liked to be able to feel superior to the kids who had physical grace, and weren't paralyzed by self-consciousness.

That it wasn't good to be cruel was another early and visceral perception, but like the majority of humans I wrapped it up in a bundle of subjunctives and put it away for special occasions.

In the seventies, when I was drunken and useless, my concerns became obsessive and I found myself trying desperately to make some sense of what was wrong, and to justify my own inane, deadened response.

In the middle of it all, I wrote a simple declarative poem that noted that the insincere artist increases the volume of human misery by making evil attractive.

It wasn’t quite the point, though it didn’t miss by much, and now in the grip of a misery so intense that I can barely bring myself to write this stuff down, I'd like to change the perception, and offer it.

I think the new one is simply and demonstrably true, which makes it the heard voice of the soul and pretty much the closest the mind comes to God.

Simply enough, it's that brutality (the use of power to degrade and to wound) is the essence of social misery, and that increasing the acceptability of brutality, whether through self-indulgence, evasion, or outright lie, is criminal.

I can think of no human reality which it is necessary to rise above other than brutality. I can think of no human misery - personal, political, economic - to which it is not central.

I am not the purist I was once, and I understand the difficulties of existence well enough to say that perhaps the best anyone can do is to try to pass on less misery than he or she has received.

But in the matter of brutality, which masquerades as passion, and righteousness, and justice, and world-weary acquiescence, and ironic distance, there is no possible gradation of acceptance.

Brutality is evil, and the evil is not of the universe.

When I was drunk, I was a savage with a bleeding heart. I savaged my family and myself as I brooded on the pain of being human, and the terrible claustrophobia of being locked in one's own head.

The truth is that I was brooding on my own betrayal of my own truths, and my compensatory, self-pitying attraction to fatality and irrevocability.

I'm sorry for those years, and the pain I inflicted on others is as real to me now as the chair I sit in, the air I breathe.

If I don't dwell on it, or in it, it's because it only has one function, and I honor that as best I can. It reminds me not to do it anymore  inflict, degrade, avoid, hide, lie, widen the scope of the brutal, and add to the misery of children.

I'm not always successful, and every once in a while I can see in my four year old son's face that something I've said angrily is going to stay with him, like a bad dream.

And my heart falls through the floor much as it always did, though now I don't run away and hide. I notice, and try to never do the same thing again.

At the onset of the Gulf War, I wrote an editorial and sent it to our major newspaper. At its center was the proposition that it's wrong to set fire to children.

I got a phone call about it, from upper editorial regions, and I was told that while it was a terrific piece of work, the paper couldn't print it even if we hadn't been at war.

'Why not?' I thought, and the whole of the skeleton of what we allow ourselves came slowly into view.

It couldn't be printed because it impinged on what we allow ourselves.

We don't think of war as setting fire to children because it would inhibit us when we want to go to war. We’re brutal when we feel like it, particularly when there’s an  outside brutality to justify and permit..

Is there anyone who doesn't know that brutality engenders brutality? I can't imagine there is.

Is there anyone not damaged by the vagaries of genetics and chemistry who hasn’t wanted to be loved and have love accepted? Sometime?

Is there anyone who can argue that it's acceptable to set fire to children?

We all have our reasons - the damaged are damaged deeply, and they do terrible things, and the helpless are brutalized terribly, and they do terrible things, and the lost and the bruised and the grieving don't know what to do to make their feelings go away, and they do terrible things.

But are there any of the sane who are willing to stand up and say "It's would be a good and proper thing to set fire to a child today."

We know. We know that it's wrong, and we know that the brutal engenders the brutal, and we know that the brutal degrades and humiliates, and hurts like hell.

But we allow ourselves. Because it's convenient, and because tomorrow, we think stupidly, it will all be over.

But it never is. Because a human being who has been violated, and had brutality enter his flesh like steel, has lost the deepest sense of self and its last dignity - "I can protect my children, I can."

Brutality leaves an empty being who is capable of inflicting his own loss on others. When her does, they become capable.

And through all this the real criminals are, as always, those who haven't been brutalized. Those who have had what they needed and never been violated and rest content in the illusions of power.

It isn't the anguished, tortured or merely blank serial killer who’s the a great criminal - it's the unanguished, untortured, balanced man of parts who allows himself. Because it's convenient, because it seems to perpetuate his power.

Stupidity isn't the problem - the major brutalities of the century have been inaugurated and executed by men of considerable intelligence. Ignorance is part of the problem, but ignorance largely inflicted by those who have the chance to not be ignorant. But pass it up  for convenience, for good times.

The problem is that we allow ourselves to inflict, though we would not be inflicted upon. And that when we have been inflicted upon, we allow ourselves those actions which will insure that it will never stop, ever, but go streaming away in front of us like the endless blood of the innocent, our one endless resource.

Is this God's fault?

Is this what we want to say when asked, "Why did you set fire to that child who only wanted to be loved, really?

That God did it?

*****************************

Sept 13, 2001

Dear Charles-- I read your two messages on the Buffalo poetics list-serve.

Just to get another articulate first hand account from someone whose voice I=
 recognized was wonderfully calming. Many, many thanks.

Things are . . . more or less fine down here in Philadelphia. To say that=
 people are shaken is, of course, an understatement. I left New York at=
 seven on Monday night, and the bus, after a very slow exit from the city,=
 skimmed along the upper Jersey shore at Weehawkin, while I gazed across the=
 river at the twin towers and the rest of the Manhattan skyline and thought=
 about how passively beautiful it was . . . Then next morning, when I was=
 walking down the impersonal pale-yellow ninth floor corridor of Anderson=
 Hall (site of the Temple English Department) to my office, 955, I heard=
 pudgy gray-bearded Dan O'Hare saying to another professor, "... crashed a=
 747 into the World Trade Center . . ." and I thought: Of course, this is a=
 joke or a description of a film--and laughed.

But, with that odd grin with which, today, we recount the unbelievable, Dan=
 turned to me: "No, I mean it. Ten minutes ago--it was on the news!"

I exclaimed, "What . . .!" with, I'm afraid, the same mindless grin.

Moments later, in her sandals and earth-colored shift, tall, make-up-less,=
 Elayne Tobin stepped out of her office.

I turned to her. "Did you hear--someone just crashed a 747--" that's what,=
 by then, we had been told--"into the World Trade Center!"

"What?" she said. "Oh, you're kidding me--" She pulled back.

"No I'm not," I said. "This is for real."

At which point, Dan, who, apparently, as he stood in the doorway, was=
 getting the report we could not hear from a radio inside, said: "Two  of=
 them! One into each tower. One tower's completely gone. The other's on=
 fire!"

"Oh, my God!" Elayne said. "No. No, I can't process this!" She turned, and=
 started quickly down the hall--and thus began a day of confusion, fear, and=
 upset, here at the University.

Yes, I've lost the transition material. But only seconds later, I remember=
 little Jena Osman looking up and saying to me, =93This is unbelievable! I=
 mean, this is unbelievable . . .!=94 Then, I turned into Graham and Bruce=
=92s office (the two graduate students whose door is directly across the=
 alcove from mine), where Howard Stern and Robin Quivers were coming over=
 the little cubic, silver-plastic radio at the back of Bruce=92s desk, and=
 over about three minutes I heard them go from joking to realizing this was=
 for real. =93Mow =92em all down, wipe =92em out,=94 was one of the phrases=
 that I recall from Stern=92s jeremiad.

By the time my ten o'clock class met, we'd had the reports from the Pentagon=
 added to it all. While we were sitting there, discussing it all, Alexander=
 (the tall, good looking black kid who sits toward the back of the class)=
 Belton=92s cell-phone rang. He took it out, and in a moment we got another=
 up-date. Seconds after the class was over, and I got back through the=
 cinderblocked stair well, from the Annex into Alexander Hall, and turned=
 into a large room where someone had a TV (not on cable: the picture was=
 black and white and snowy), where I watched the smoke pouring out of the=
 pentagon, and then saw--for what, over the last three days, now seems the=
 first of hundreds of times--the two towers, one, then the other, smoking,=
 imploding, collapsing.=20

It was World Peace Day--

Only months ago America and Israel--arrogantly; for however much one=
 disapproves of how things are being carried out, it would seem that there=
 is still some onus on the participants to sit it out and keep articulating=
 their objections (even if, or especially if, it seems to be just an=
 Israel-bashing session, though even their own objections to the=
 characterization of "Zionism" as an inherently racist philosophy don't seem=
 to make into that)--walked out on the Racism Conference in South Africa--

How long ago did our government decide not to "publicize" the murder of two=
 million people in Rwanda, for fear someone might want us to get involved--

I love America passionately. What an odd and simple thing to say. Yet=
 something such as this makes me incredibly aware of it. It=92s a beautiful=
 and wonderful country in so many, historically fabulous ways--ways that it=
 would take fables to make comprehensible to Tocqueville and Proudhon and=
 even Marx. Its people *and* its government are extraordinary in endless=
 documentable ways. There is no justification for the horror that this=
 is--not represents, but is. Still, the one thing I am sure of, is that=
 while the media keeps naming this a "cowardly attack," those who did=
 it--however misinformed they might be--thought of it as a "brave defense"=
 against the forces of Imperialism. Until our government understands that,=
 there will be no possibility of peace, because both sides can only speak=
 past one another in a field of such misunderstanding.

To date there is no general traffic to and from Manhattan.

I've got my hypertension medicine for the next several weeks.

I now know, of course, that it was a 767 and a 757 (not two 747s) that=
 crashed into the towers: I have the whole CNN chronology, from 8:45am till=
 2:00 pm, cut out and pasted in my journal.

Stories keep coming in, such as from my friend John Castro, in Brooklyn, who=
 heard about the first strike, ran up on the roof, and Saw=97disbelieving--t=
he second plane fly into second tower. =93. . . There was all this smoke.=
 And for little while, you couldn=92t see anything--then, the smoke blew=
 away. And one of the towers was gone . . .!=94=20

The morning of the 11th, perhaps six or seven hours before the towers were=
 struck, Vince Czyz (who read for us last year at the Wednesday=92s at Four=
 program) wrote me the following e-mail:

=93Yesterday walking out of the gym where I work out a mere twice a week (20=
 minutes on that stationary bike rounds out the workout), I was feeling=
 quite good, it was about 5 pm, sunny, warm not hot. Just as I stepped out=
 of the gym, there was a sort of muffled thunder and the sort of concussion=
 that makes your chest hum some. I thought, =93Oh, those Turks. Fireworks=
 again.=94 Here, there are firework displays if there is a marriage, if a=
 team wins, if someone looses his virginity . . . all right, I exaggerate,=
 but they=92re common here. I thought nothing more of it.

=93Coming out of my apartment in Taksim about 15 minutes later, I saw cop=
 cars rushing about, ambulances peeling down the raot, lights flashing,=
 sirens wailing and I saw ordinary motorists doing about 150 mph in Taksim=
 Square with hazard lights on and horns blowing. I saw a crowd of people=
 gathered in the Square and I wondered what was going on. But as I was late=
 for a private lesson and my students are paying me about $25 an hour, I=
 hurried into the metro.

=93The thunder turned out to be a bomb, which killed the woman carrying it=
 and two policemen. It happened a few hundred meters from where I was but I=
 was more than shielded by all the buildings in between.

"It is, as far as I know, the first lethal bomb blast in Taksim, the center=
 of Istanbul, in about nine years=97and very close to the site of that one.=
 We did have one in Sisli, a mile or so from Taksim, about a year ago, and=
 although cops were targeted, only the bomber was killed.=94

Vince=92s message goes on to mention the names of possible groups=
 responsible=97names that, fifteen hours later, would be relatively familiar=
 to all of us, if they weren=92t already: =93 . . . the Turkish Hezbollah.=
 Possibly the Kurdish Worker=92s Party? Unlike the Middle East, it=92s often=
 the case that no one claims responsibility. I think the military=92s gonna=
 reprise anyway.=94=20

And a day later, my friend Robert Morales phones to tell me ... that the=
 streets are deserted: =93Times Square at four in the afternoon looked more=
 like what it usually does at one AM on Monday morning=97and pretty much=
 every movie house in the city is packed, with all but no seating in no=
 matter what the film. Apparently there=92s nothing to do but watch TV or go=
 to the movies . . .=94=20

Tom Besio, estranged husband of the artist Who drew *Bread & Wine*, and who=
 works out of  his and his wife=92s loft on Church Street as an=
 acupuncturist, was out on the balcony doing exercises, when he heard the=
 first plane swoop by, looked up, and saw it strike. He and a dozen others,=
 coming out on the grilled fire escapes that front that swing-out picture=
 windows, stared at the smoking tower until the second plane struck. At that=
 point, apparently, everyone watching realized it was *not* an accident and=
 turned and fled the building, the neighborhood . . . !

On the 11th, phone calling in and out of the city was, of course, almost=
 impossible. I know this (in my case) from twenty-five, thirty-five calls=
 with all lines busy. Once when I was out of the office, Dennis managed to=
 get a call through to me and leave a message on my machine. Did I cuss =
 *my*-self out for going to the bathroom just then . . .? Finally, around=
 four-thirty, I got two calls through.

Dennis tells me my sister is all right, though the city is basically under=
 marshal law.

Second day information: Well, we live on a block (in Manhattan) with a=
 police precinct at the other end, and so are cordoned off with yellow tape.=
 Phalanxes of officers roam around. Anyone who lives on the block has to=
 show name-and-address ID to get back into our building, so Dennis and John=
 Del Gaizo both report.

This morning at breakfast, here in Philadelphia, at a little place called=
 Logan's about two blocks from where I live on Spruce Street, I listened to=
 a local policemen tell a tall thin, and a small butterball of a, waitress=
 that a bizarre burglar is loose in the neighborhood. (Is it connected to=
 the general confusion or not? No one knows.) Since yesterday morning, he=
 has committed over ten burglaries in a three block area. At the last place=
 he robbed--since no one was home--he stayed long enough to take a shower=
 before he left. Indeed, in Philadelphia the visible police force on the=
 street has doubled overnight, and there is much talk of possible looting=
 and similar unrest even here--though the city is sunny and leaves chatter=
 over the red-brick streets of Center City.

I'm supposed to be in the city this weekend (to have dinner with a scholar=
 visiting from Germany), but I wonder whether things will be back to normal=
 enough for me to return. My very intelligent daughter tells me that I=
 should get Dennis down here, rather than going back to him. But, the truth=
 is, I feel as if I have abandoned my city, my home--and that I have some=
 sort of duty to be there, indeed, if just as a witness.

Wednesday night, I went to a bar on South Street where I often have=
 dinner--Manny Brown=92s. Four of the six televisions that they have in the=
 back, where I eat, were replaying the disaster. Robert M. had pointed out=
 that there are dozens, if not hundreds of video tapes of the incidents,=
 beginning to end, from practically every conceivable angle. At this point,=
 I feel like I have seen them all, several times through. Only as I was=
 leaving Brown's to go home through the neo-punk piercings and tatooings of=
 South Street, did it strike me: The media was, whether on purpose or not,=
 trying to make it seem as if there had been dozens on dozens of attacks.=
 The effect was kind of like the fantasia of atom bombs going off to the=
 melody and lyrics of "We'll Meet Again . . ." at the end of *Dr.=
 Strangelove.*

Back at my Spruce Street apartment, last night at three in the morning, I=
 woke with a strangely persistent memory of the first time--twenty-odd years=
 ago--I had flown back to New York and the plane had crossed over lower=
 Manhattan, en route to LaGuardia. I'd looked down out the oval plastic=
 window to see that great steel-and-glass tuning-fork, sticking up above all=
 the surrounding buildings and thought: =93My God, remember when, in the=
 thirties, that plane rammed the Empire State building? Those would be so=
 *easy* to hit! Some suicidal, psychotic pilot . . . Some crazed terrorist .=
 . .=94 The thought was so appalling I=92d shoved it down, as one does, but=
 last night it emerged and lay there for me to look at--and breathe deeply=
 over. It made me wonder how many other people had thought the same thing in=
 twenty-odd years.

The other thought that came to me, so strongly, to make me choke and blink: =
 (I may go back on it, but right now I doubt it):

If we kill *single* Arab civilian in retaliation for this, then--given what=
 was just done to us, and after having experienced and watched and listened=
 to its effects on all the radically innocent men and women whose lives have=
 been shattered, so many of them forever--we will have started the horrible,=
 horrible process that could, in some out-of-touch minds, come close to=
 justifying what was done. (Because it says, yes, when you have been enraged=
 and made to suffer, striking out and killing innocent people is all right.=
 And isn=92t that the essence of terrorism, no matter who does it?) And we=
 mustn't do that.

This is rushed=97and, indeed, is a version of a letter I'm sending to a=
 number of people. (Should you feel like forwarding it, please do.) But for=
 all that, I send my most personal and specific

Love to you, B., and the kids,

--Chip

Thursday night it started to pour. The piercing thunder claps echoed over
Manhattan. We all woke up with a start and couldn't find the way back to
sleep.

Andrew tells us the story of a British man who showed up on time for his
hair cutting appointment, 4pm, Tuesday. He had been on an upper floor of
the Trade Center when the jet hit.

By mistake I first wrote "Word Trade Center."

Tuesday morning I rouse my friend Stu from a profound slumber to tell him
what has happened to the twin towers.  -- "They're ugly," he says, after a
pause, "but they're not that ugly."

In the last few days, everyone I know seems to need to be in touch with
everyone else. At first, it was mostly calls and emails from outside the
U.S. Now there is steady stream local calls: where were you when, how are
you feeling now. Every story is riveting, from the ones where the people
were alone watching live TV to the many who watched the events unfold, how
to put it?, live and in person. Those who saw the towers collapse, who saw
the people jumping, were seared in a way the rest of us have been spared.

A visceral need to lash out, to strike down, to root out, to destroy in
turn for what has been destroyed, seems to grip so many, grips part of
me.  When a co-worker expresses just this sentiment, someone complains to
her,  "Don't you think we need to find out who is responsible before we do
anything?" She shrugs: not necessarily.

It's as if the blasts occurred dozens of time, the actual blasts being
obliterated by the constant replay.

I feel like I am going through those stages in an unwritten book by
Kubler-Ross: first denial, then manic fascination, then listlessness, then
depression. Now denial again.

I can't get the film out of my mind. You know, the one in which a
crackerjack team of conspirators meets in an abandoned hanger and
meticulously plots out the operation on a blackboard. Synchronize
watches!  This image stands in the way of what occurred in the way that a
blizzard stands in the way of the sky.

Out of the blue, flags everywhere.

Things I do everyday like make airplane reservations on the phone are now
fraught with an unwanted emotional turbulence.

In some ways the blasts are a natural disaster, like an earthquake or
volcanic eruption. Though we might wish to fight it, human beings and what
they do are also a part of nature.

The "letter" trains are mostly running but I always think in terms of IRT,
BMT, IND. Well, the A is OK from 207th to West 4th but the C's down; the D
now ends at 34th. The E's canceled service below West 4th indefinitely. As
to my local trains, no service on the 2 & 3 and the 1 stops at 34th.

After the initial crash, an official period of panic set in. During this
time, all bet's were off. We were told to expect anything, any target next.
This period of official panic has set the tone for the days after and may
have a more profound effect than the events.

Now, Sunday, it's cold for the first time. The summer is over.

I bomb
you bomb
he/she/it bombs
we bomb
you bomb
they suffer

We're ugly, but we're not that ugly.

&, hey, Joe, don't you know --

We is they.

Joe,

Not much time to respond right now -- But yes, given that the guilty
parties are more likely than not a non-state organization, and any
attempt to declare "war" on their "network" would require a declaration
more wide-ranging and disastrous than the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, it
seems appropriate to treat this as a criminal case. Given the only
sporadic interest in international law on the part of U.S. officials
generally, the U.S. right more specifically, and this administration in
particular, securing such an approach would certainly be an uphill
struggle.

But I agree with you, it beats the hand-washing of pure nonintervention.
And it's a sustainable (albeit bound-to-be deeply problematic) ethical
and political ground from which to build, unlike an approach which wants
to make various states surrogates for the culprits, and then probably
make their civilian populations surrogates for _them_. My fear there,
aside from the obvious moral repugnance of a policy that has a calculus
of justification for "collateral damage," is that what has already
happened will happen again, more so. Take away enough from a people,
whether through military force or economic blockade, and what's left is
the power to die. As we've seen this week, struggles between the power
to kill and the power to die do form the basis of a kind of nascent
global order. But I don't think it's one we want.

Peace,
Taylor

To Everyone -


This is poorly written, but it has been on my mind for the past two days:

I mourn the passing of 6000 or more lives, like everyone else. I cry like
everyone else over this. I work through mourning, like everyone, and lose
sleep, watch the news, like everyone. And I support the elimination of
terrorism, coupled with a redistribution of wealth and communications on a
global scale, like many of us. This may be another story, or it may be the
same story.

But I do not fly an American flag, wear red white and blue; this tragedy
does not make me patriotic, only sad. I fear patriotism and leadership; I
fear nationalism which all too often degenerates into further drawings of
lines, further ignorance, further racisms.

I fear, in other words, the calls to the flag, the calls to Americanism,
the calls to patriotism.

And I do not seek vengeance or violence, and I deplore the rhetoric of war,
vengeance, and violence dominating the news. I resent the transformation of
tragedy into this rhetoric, mourning into firearms.

I fear, in other words, the calls for war, the calls for vengeance, the
violence already enacted against Arabs in our streets.

I do not pray to God, to any God, and I resent the implications that this
should be our means of dealing with the tragedy, or coming together as a
nation.

I fear, in other words, the call to religion, even for those of us who
have no belief, no religion, no desire to create even more havoc in the
names of gods who can only be unjust.

A lot of us find our country turning away from us, just as it turns to
war, nationalism, flags, patriotism, and vengeance above all. Eliminating
terrorism is one thing - the rhetoric and all it implies, is something
else again, incredibly dangerous. The tragedy did not make me feel "more
an American" - if anything, it makes me feel more an internationalist than
ever - so many foreign citizens were also killed. And if the Net has
taught us anything, it is that ultimately we will all rise and fall
together, not separated by boundaries tempered only by the vagaries of
history.

We already see the result of the rhetoric in the violence against Arabs,
or anyone appearing "Arab-looking," across the United States.

Let us do whatever we can to endure. But let us also speak out, with care,
on and off the Net, before we are all silenced.

And let us mourn.

Alan

I've been reading the posts on the list over the past
few days, and have been deeply impressed by the
response of American and NYC list members to the
atrocity at the WTC. Given their physical and
emotional proximity to the outrage, the balance,
intelligence and humanity of the Americans' posts are
remarkable. Not one of you seems to have been captured
by the warmongering and xenophobic spirit that Bush et
al are trying to whip up.

I write this from distant New Zealand, where Muslims
are being spat at and attacked and talkback radio is
carrying calls for nuclear war against Afghanistan.

Best Wishes to you all,

Patrick, Hilton, Taylor and others,

I share your fears - Taylor's phrase 'a war made of wars' took me back
to Paul Virilio's notion of 'pure war' which previously I've held at a
distance, wary of its deterministic shadings. It is predicated on the
penetrability of the mechanisms of war into our everyday lives and one
of the ways he arrives at it is by cataloging the range of technological
advances now shaping our lives that have their roots in military
contexts. The horrific nature of the present situation is that, with the
US Govt framing retaliatory action as 'a war on terrorism', that
penetration will, it seems to me, reach an unsurpassable peak of
actualisation (with one form being, of course, intrusive restrictions on
civil liberties - Dubya senior's seeing to that bit). At one point
Virilio states:-

'Pure War is speed and military population. It is thus the population of
time, the ultimate figure of projected societies'

and as I noted in my previous post, there can be no foreseeable end to
'a war on terrorism', the phrase is simply the means by which a US govt
legitimises itself to continue a state of war indefinitely - revealing
that that govt is essentially a war mechanism, something its foreign
policy record since WWII onwards has progressively shown - the
difference now being that all need for covert action, or frequent use of
third parties, will be unnecessary (and if anyone still needs to know
the grisly details of that policy, John Pilger has just listed them out
for ZNet at:- http://www.zmag.org/pilgercalam.htm - on the same site you
can read, among others, James Ingalls piece 'New To Us, Not to Afghans'
where the full details of the CIA's support of bin Laden are discussed)

having said all that, I refuse still to simply succumb to the
deterministic overtones here - (for one, the tool I'm now using came
from the military but is allowing me to share these thoughts) - after my
post is an uplifting article describing a peace activists meeting in
Austin, Texas on Wednesday that demonstrates the importance of seizing
and building on all opportunities for expression of frustration and
anger against the impudent war-march of the US govt - (with Euro govts
leashed behind of course, willingly, thanks to the invoking of Article 5
of NATO's charter)

I'd also like to add my thanks to Brian, Charles, Hal, Gary, Lee Ann and
other New Yorkers, whose detailings of their movements around Manhatten
over the last two days have read, in the naming of streets, citing of
stories and images, the descriptions of returns to the routines of
everyday life, like tender acts of resuscitation of a damaged city and
its people

all my support,
Rob Holloway.



No, Mr. Bush, Not Everyone Wants Bloodshed
Rahul Mahajan, AlterNet
September 13, 2001
http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=11501

As the calls for war in the mainstream media and the halls of power grow
louder, with Senator John McCain speaking for many when he said, "God
may have mercy on them, but we won't," a different kind of response has
been building as well.

The peace community -- from established groups like Peace Action and the
Fellowship of Reconciliation to grassroots activists across the country
--has united in a strong, consistent and deeply heartfelt response.
Reading the statements being put out, one sees clearly that the entire
community joins wholeheartedly with the nation in condemning the brutal
attack of two days ago, and in the fear, grief and shattering sense of
loss it has occasioned.

There is also widespread agreement that there should be no rush to
judgment and no massive "retaliation" that would target the innocent
civilians of any country. Noting that international law does not
recognize any right of retaliation or vengeance (Chapter 7 of the UN
Charter, which governs the use of force, requires that any action be
taken only with the permission, and under the auspices of, the Security
Council, the only exception being self-defense against imminent attack
which does not include vengeance for past attacks), Peace Action and
others are calling clearly for any remaining perpetrators to be brought
to justice through legal channels, with international cooperation.

Very similar sentiments were expressed in a community discussion last
night, organized by Austin's progressive activist community. Two hundred
and fifty people came together, to express their emotions and their
experiences, to share ideas and information, and to plan future actions.

From the beginning, it was clear that people really needed to talk.
There was no good way to cope with the flurry of hands that was raised
at every pause.

One young man tearfully expressed his fear that, with all the talk of
America going to war, the draft would be reinstated and that he would
have to kill or die in an effort he opposed. Several were afraid of the
loss of our civil liberties. Others shared their fear for friends,
relatives and friends of friends who worked near the World Trade
Centers, and who had not been heard from. Everyone felt grief and anger
that so many innocent people were killed.

Many, however, expressed strong emotions of a different kind. Deep
disquiet with their friends and acquaintances caught up in a vortex of
fury, often racist in tone. Anger at the mainstream media, almost
universally perceived to be even worse than government officials in
their constant calls for blood -- somebody's, anybody's. Guilt, pain and
sorrow on contemplating the seemingly inevitable killing of innocent
civilians being planned by our government.

And, far and away the most common feeling, isolation. Many expressed
their heartfelt gratitude that the discussion had been organized,
because they had been feeling, "Nobody else thinks the way I do."

After talking through their feelings, many who had been sunk in despair
felt newly energized to do what they could to head off war, and the
discussion ended in a massive organizing meeting.

The lesson is clear. There are many, many people in this country who see
clearly that one killing of innocents will not be requited by another,
that a radically different path is needed to assure our security and
that of people in other parts of the world.

In the days to come, if those people rely only on the television and the
big daily newspapers, they will feel isolated and beleaguered, deprived
of their voices and their democratic right to help shape the public
dialogue.

That will be a tremendous tragedy. Even though this is an incredibly
difficult time to speak up, and voices against war will inevitably be
branded as apologists for terror, this is also a very important time to
speak up. Americans have seen up close the tangible effects of our
foreign policy, and they are interested as they have not been since the
nuclear freeze movement, maybe even since the Vietnam war.

Let us call, then, for communities across the country to have similar
dialogues, to work through feelings of pain, fear and grief and begin to
fashion a coherent response to warmongering before the war is upon us.
We who favor peace must create our own national dialogue before we can
hope to influence the larger one.

Austin could have such a large meeting on such short notice because of a
multi-year sustained effort (www.nowarcollective.com), centering around
antiwar work, that has built up a very large (4,000) email announcement
and rapid response list. Localities without that kind of infrastructure
may take a little longer, but the need for timely action is great.

I=92ve written a report on part of my day yesterday, in part to record, and i=
n
part to try and write again. It was written on auto-pilot, to some extent,
but I=92m sending it out because I feel the need to try and connect with
what=92s=20
going on, and with other people, through writing. I think people are having
a=20
hard time functioning, and what I=92m writing through is basically an attempt
to go to work. I can=92t bear this stunned grief internally any more, at this
point, and I=92m not ready to try and put my writing head around the
intentions=20
and politics of the actions on Tuesday. Please respond in kind, if you want
to or can.=20


9/13=20

Somehow have to get up and head out to Rutgers U. in New Brunswick to teach
an 11:30 poetry workshop. Anticipating a class of shell-shocked students, I
wonder what I am going to be able to say to them, and start pondering the
possibilities. Mainly need to keep myself calm and focused, then encourage
them to start articulating. The subways are closed below 42nd St., so I nee=
d
to walk up to Penn Station from the apt. I share with Karen on 7th and A,
currently part of the blocked off "restricted zone" under 14th St. Karen is
supposed to teach at St. John=92s in Staten Island, but it is impossible to
get=20
to Staten Island from Manhattan this morning, so she doesn=92t go. It was jus=
t
two mornings ago that she was on the subway heading downtown when the plane=
s
crashed into the towers, and in the Ferry Terminal when the buildings
started=20
to come down just a few blocks away. Waiting to find out if she was safe
that=20
morning was terrifying for several hours.
The fumes last night from the blasts and subsequent fires were pervasive an=
d
nearly overwhelming. I had been as far downtown as Chatham Square in
Chinatown on Tuesday, but the winds didn=92t start blowing the smoke uptown
until yesterday. All of the East Village smelled like burning rubber and
steel. Many people covering their faces with masks and scarves. This mornin=
g
the fumes have lessened somewhat in intensity, but the odor is still strong=
,
provoking a disturbing feeling of omniscient dread within my sense of the
atmosphere that I try to will out of my imagination, mostly unsuccessfully.
Walk to 14th St and 2nd avenue, and pick up the first papers I=92ve seen sinc=
e
Tuesday morning. As I keep walking I decide to stop in at my other job at
Baruch College around 9 am to see who is there, and check in on the state o=
f
the main office. I talk to one person, a supervisor named Paul, with instan=
t
recognition that we both don=92t want to be there but need to be doing
something so=85 I ask if I should turn in timesheets, as they are due today.
Feels petty to worry about this, but I=92ve just about run out of money buyin=
g
extra groceries and knowing I need to acquire some masks, have money on
hand,=20
etc. What is the state of money in all of this? He tells me it=92s ok, and
that=20
I should try to come back and work later that day when I get back from
Rutgers, even if only to show up for a little while.
    Leaving Baruch I head to Penn Station, which was evacuated last night
because of a bomb threat that turned out to be a false alarm. I=92m struck by
the difference between my neighborhood, where there is only the traffic of
emergency vehicles and police cars w./ sirens blaring and a host of
different=20
kinds of supply trucks, and this near-midtown area where life and congested
traffic on the surface almost appears to be as is, or as was. I=92ve never
seen=20
so many people staring hollow-eyed into space, even as they walk towards
their jobs. And the traffic fumes are nearly as bad as the fumes downtown.
I=92ve been sneezing, coughing, and red-eyed all morning, my sinuses feeling
ready to burst.=20
    Arriving at Penn Station around 9:40 I instantly notice that people onl=
y
seem to be leaving the building, which freaks me for a split-second, but
then=20
I see folks getting on the down escalator and I never break stride entering=
.
New Jersey Transit is running on a normal schedule, so I head out to
Rutgers,=20
a 55-minute trip. In New Brunswick all of my breathing and sinus problems
are=20
gone, which scares me. I meet my students, who slowly file into class
looking=20
hollow and glassy-eyed. We manage to have a real, engaged discussion about
what is going on, how to approach thinking about this situation, and how to
manage our imaginations and feelings. One student wants to talk a lot but i=
s
constantly on the verge of spiraling, though he never does. A few remain
silent all class. Some have friends missing. New Brunswick is very close to
Manhattan, and everyone in the room is worried about at least several peopl=
e
they know who either live or work in the city. One student has a family
connection via friendship with the family of one of the hijacked plane
pilots. I gently try to remind them that, as a class geared towards many
levels of communication, we can turn our work to dealing with this mad
reality we have been blasted into. Looking beyond the headlines and sound
bites, incorporating documentation, research, questioning, into our work.
Putting the news we can=92t find in the mainstream media into our own writing=
.
Tracking our imaginations, in order to prevent, to the extent it is
possible,=20
ourselves from being overwhelmed by our emotions. Recognizing that we are i=
n
a collective state of shock, and that this shock is going to change into
other states. Recognizing that a balance of perspectives needs to be
maintained in order to see most clearly, and that we need to articulate and
repeat our stories. Recognizing that most of the rest of the world=92s
countries have been through unbelievable levels of suffering, and that
international viewpoints will be vital to our understanding of what has jus=
t
happened as well as how our culture and society have instantaneously been
transformed. I ask them if they know much about Afghanistan, and there is n=
o
reaction. So I feel the need to tell them they will be hearing a lot about
this country, and that its people are unbearably impoverished, having been
subjected to drought, invasion, civil war, and totalitarian rule for years.
That those people need to be thought of as people, not one country=92s name
only, or one man=92s name only.
    The class gives me some sense of relief, both during (once I realize I
can actually lead a discussion) and after. I=92m relieved to finally have som=
e
level of public-oriented responsibility to attend to, and that the students
are present enough to gather, speak, and listen. And I=92m not surprised that
one of the most difficult things to talk about is the deaths of all the
firefighters, police, and emergency workers after the collapse of the first
tower. The pain from that news is still too close to articulate fully.
    Heading back to Manhattan is the next step, so I get back on the train
at=20
1:39 p.m., which again arrives and leaves on time. I have four newspapers t=
o
read now, and am buried in their pages until we reach Newark. The train
takes=20
a very, very slow approach to Manhattan, and at a specific point when the
WTC=20
normally comes into view everyone on my car has their head turned in that
direction, southeast from our train. It=92s the first time I=92ve seen the full
view of the skyline without the towers in person, and the slow pace of the
train adds an eerie, cinematic quality to the moment that I try hard to
repel, again mostly unsuccessfully. There are people on the car taking
pictures and shooting video, but no one says a word. The cloud of smoke
rising is somewhat lighter than yesterday, so there is at least some sense
that no more buildings have collapsed today.
    The walk back home from Penn Station is ridiculous and painful. I get u=
p
onto the street and see flags being hawked on just about every corner. I=92m
supposed to be looking for face masks because they ran out in our area and
Karen, I and others are having a lot of trouble with the smoke and dust.
Traffic is locked up everywhere, and several streets are less available tha=
n
others.  After picking up some masks in a hardware store on 29th St., I hea=
d
over to Baruch again, ca. 28th and Lex. But there are at least ten times th=
e
amount of people in the area now as opposed to this morning. It turns out
that the Armory building across the street from the new Vertical Campus is
being used as a center for family members and friends of people missing in
the rubble of the WTC. There are more TV vans and journalists out than I ca=
n
count, scores of those color xeroxes I=92ve seen people carrying on TV pasted
up in storefront windows and on the sides of vans, and interviews being
conducted on side streets. There are also military vehicles in the area, an=
d
restricted access to Lexington Ave, plus more people walking with cell
phones=20
than I=92ve ever seen (underscoring the difficulty of getting and receiving
calls the last three days), and one huge just-installed satellite dish on
28th and Lex., or thereabouts. I can get back into Baruch because I have an
I.D., but there turns out to be no reason to be there. I=92m supposed to have
drop-in tutoring hours from 5-10, and there=92s no one who is going to be
there, so I cross those hours out of my mind for today even though it is
only=20
about 3 p.m.=20
    Closing in on 14th St. I=92m nervous about two things: the checkpoint, an=
d
the fumes. More people with masks on are dotting the streets, and the fumes=
,
though lessened from this morning in intensity, are starting to hit me
again.=20
I put on a mask and cross 14th St., and despite there being a number of
police officers on the southwest corner, none ask me for I.D. (I have heard
from other people who were checked, including my brother, but all were
yesterday). Back in my neighborhood, which also happens to be where I grew
up, there is still no traffic, though many people walking around. I=92m
totally=20
exhausted =96 didn=92t really sleep the night before, but want to get home. So =
I
do, and get back to the process of collecting news, trying to get in touch
with people unaccounted for, handling all of this shock and emotion,
figuring=20
out how to be and what to do, looking beyond the general news, and preparin=
g
for more bad news.

Maybe I missed something, but when was this?  What I saw was a
multi-denominational,
multi-faith service (strange for me as an atheist) and both Bush and the
mayor of NYC emphasizing that all peoples of all faiths were Americans tried
and true, or something like that.  Our leaders, most of whom I don't trust
any more than the leaders of other countries, have nevertheless made it
clear, as far as I can tell, that our anger is not aimed at a specific region
and its quotidian culture, but at an international network of terror.  We can
love this country, or we can blame for everything from Hitler to swollen
feet.  But I've done a bit of traveling, and the USA is easily the most

another, seemingly unpopular, point of view on the record.  Best, Bill

All;
I am forwarding this letter, written on the evening of september 11, 2001
on behalf of my partner, Courtney F. Thompson.
yours
derek beaulieu
calgary, alberta, canada
***

I was awakened on the morning of Tuesday, 11 September by the telephone, at
the other end of which was my mother, sobbing with fear and grief. Like most
North Americans, I found myself transfixed by the events of 11 September,
shocked and horrified by the television images that continue to illuminate
my living room as I write, long after nightfall. I cannot begin to imagine
the terror and grief of those whose lives have been and continue to be
dramatically altered by these events; the distance from which I view them,
though objectively safe, does not seem at all safe to me, and I cannot
contemplate finding myself any closer to them. As Prime Minister Chrétien
announced in his official statement, the thoughts and prayers of all
Canadians are with our American friends. We are not unlike identical twins
raised in separate homes-indistinguishable to all but ourselves. As often as
we have chided our American neighbours for their apparent idiosyncrasies
they are, as Chrétien asserted, our allies and our friends, and we will do
all that we can to support and aid them; this is no empty rhetorical
statement of solidarity, especially if the enormous crowds at Canadian Blood
Services' Clinics and the willingness of Canadians to open their homes to
stranded American travelers are any indication, which I believe they are.
Throughout the coverage of the terrorist attacks on Tuesday, international
officials, commentators, and experts denounced the acts of the perpetrators
as cowardly and despicable, which they certainly were. U.S. President George
W. Bush and others drew the attention of the world to the fact that these
terrorist acts were motivated by a desire to darken the American "beacon of
freedom," to mute the liberated voices of the world's most prominent
democracy. The American President asserted that the terrorists had not and
would not succeed in "shaking the foundations of America." The rights and
freedoms of all law-abiding American citizens, their individual ways of
life, their indomitable spirit could not and would not be shaken by the
cowardly acts of a small group of evil people.
But he was wrong.
I am not here referring to the grounding of aircraft, the halting of rail
traffic, or the other emergency powers justifiably exercised by the U.S.
Government in the wake of these horrific attacks. Neither do I write of the
projected implications of the increased security measures that will likely
result from these events. Rather, I am deeply concerned at the abandonment,
by a small group of Americans, of the principles for which their country
stands, of their return of prejudice for prejudice, injustice for injustice,
blind hatred for blind hatred, and especially by the failure of the American
leadership and news media to blink an eye at this betrayal of American
principles, a betrayal which was reported without comment.
The Americans were, in the words of their own President, viciously attacked
not for who they are, but for what they are, for what the United States
represents in the world community. My American friends are justifiably proud
of their international status, filled with an admirable patriotism at their
country's reputation as the stewards of freedom and the defenders of
innocence; they are aware that their very power and prominence as well as
their bold initiatives on the international scene make them targets of
hatred and suspicion, but they have always maintained that the goal is worth
the price. Perhaps they will feel differently now, but the rallying of the
American people in the wake of these unspeakable attacks suggests otherwise.
As moved as I was by the courageous and praiseworthy response of the
American people to these horrifying events, I was almost equally
disheartened and disappointed to learn that Arab and Muslim communities and
organizations in the United States were finding themselves the victims of a
crime which, though it certainly does not have the same devastating scope as
the terrorist attacks, has the same evil root cause: blind, ignorant hatred.
Such a response to these Arab and Muslim Americans in the wake of this
tragedy is perhaps explicable as a natural backlash-ignorance, not
familiarity, breeds the most dangerous kind of contempt-but the failure of
the news networks and the American leadership to respond promptly and
decisively to these undemocratic and hateful activities is inexcusable. The
reports of hate mail and threats of violence against these American
communities appeared as a largely-ignored blip on CNN's scrolling screen
commentary, reducing what should have been a cry for tolerance to a whimper.
The burden upon the American leadership and its news media is unimaginable
at this moment, but in all of the reiterated statements about the protection
of the American way of life and the preservation of both American principles
and American lives, there was almost no mention of this gross violation-by
Americans-of the principles that that country has so steadfastly protected
throughout its history and to which it now returns in a time of crisis. In
the wake of such an attack and in the light of its motivation, the American
government has a duty to protect all of its citizens and to ensure that the
principles on which it stands and the Constitution which it so devotedly
protects are upheld; if the spirit, and not just the fact, of these
terrorist attacks is to be defied and overcome, the real protection offered
by those principles and laws needs to be available to all Americans, not
just to those mostly-white Christian Americans whose faces filled our
television screens on 11 September. These horrific attacks having been
motivated by a desire to alter the American way of life and to force
Americans to reexamine their commitment to peace and justice for all, the
American leadership cannot afford to defend those principles for some
citizens while denying their benefits to others. I am not suggesting that a
large-scale investigation of these hate crimes is possible at this moment,
but only that someone, in all of the endless commentary and morbid fixation,
needs to say something, needs to assure these Arab and Muslim Americans that
they are valued members of the American community; a message needs to be
communicated also to these hate criminals that their actions and attitudes
are far more dangerous to the American way of life than is the average
Arab-American shopkeeper or teacher, or Muslim-American businessman or
parent who lives down the block or on the other side of the country. It may
be discovered that there were indeed American Arabs or Muslims behind these
events, but they are no more representative of the large community of Arab
and Muslim Americans than is the average white man of the White Supremacy
movement or, indeed, as these hate criminals are of the American public at
large. The American Constitution, way of life, and system of law are largely
based upon a perception that they allow the United States and its citizens
to hold the moral high ground and to ensure the rights of all American
citizens, irrespective of race, religion, country of origin, or gender;
although it may appear, as it did on CNN, a mere footnote to the horrific
events of Tuesday morning, this seemingly-ignored breach of the
Constitutional rights and the human dignity of these American people
represents a real danger to those strongly-held and often-enunciated
American principles. That moral high ground has made Americans who and what
they are, has imparted to their government and way of life a dignity and
respectability which is recognized throughout the free world: the foundation
of their government depends upon it.
To my knowledge, two commentators-writer Tom Clancy, of whose novels I
thought I was dreaming this morning, and former Secretary of State Warren
Christopher-stressed the need for tolerance toward Arab and non-Arab Muslim
Americans. The subject was too quickly changed by the network anchors to be
thoroughly examined. Islam, as Clancy and Christopher asserted, is a
religion which upholds justice, love, and peace, as well as basic human
equality; it is the only major monotheistic religion explicitly to declare
the equality of all persons, irrespective of race. Despite any apparent
evidence to the contrary, Islam is not a call to arms and Muslims are not,
by definition, terrorists. They are a peace-loving and just people whose God
is not all that different from that worshipped by Jews and Christians. We
cannot hold all Muslims responsible for acts carried out by madmen in the
name of Islam any more than all Christians can be held accountable for the
actions of Adolf Hitler, himself an avowed Christian, who ordered the
placement of the Nazi flag in the chancels of all churches in the Third
Reich. Similarly, as Secretary Christopher pointed out, the American and
Canadian governments were blind and unjust in their persecution of Japanese
North Americans during and after the Second World War; the actions of our
forefathers and -mothers in the detainment and disenfranchisement of our
fellow citizens is a burden that we continue to bear with sorrow and regret,
representing as it does a betrayal of those principles so close to our
hearts. The burden of Arab and Muslim Americans at this moment is
unspeakable. How horrified might have white Christian Americans been to be
identified unilaterally with Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols in the wake
of the Oklahoma City bombing?  As Americans, their thoughts are with their
countrymen and -women; as people of faith, their prayers are with the
victims of these horrific events, as well as with the victims' families and
with the American leadership; as Muslims, their horror at the devastating
acts perpetrated in the name of their God is overwhelmingly sickening. In
addition to this attack on their country, this violation of their political
principles, and this perversion of their faith, they are confronted with
hatred directed toward them because of the God they worship and, in the case
of Arab Americans, the colour of their skin; that this affront to their
dignity and attack on their humanity are occurring in a country which
guarantees their rights to worship their God and to fear no unjust
persecution is a fact which must leave them bewildered and afraid, betrayed
by the country to which they have sworn their loyalty and to which they have
devoted their lives.
Of the American news media, I ask: where, in all of your coverage of this
event, from replays of the horrible spectacles and the fleeing people to the
interviews with prominent Christian figures, was your coverage of the
prayers of Muslim Americans for the safety of their fellow citizens and the
swift apprehension of the perpetrators? Why did you choose to represent all
devotees of Islam solely through coverage of celebrations in streets
thousands of miles away instead of also representing the horrified concern,
devoted prayers and devastated sorrow of your own Muslim citizens? As
members of a free press in a free country upholding the freedom of all
Americans, how can you ignore the rights, the loyalty, and the anguish of
fellow citizens in your midst? To the American leadership: defend your
principles at home as you do abroad. Tell the American people and the people
of the world that you do not accept these terrorists' perversion of the
Islamic faith, as their betrayal of its principles proves that it is not
theirs to change; tell your Muslim citizens that their prayers are as
welcome as those of their Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, and animist
fellows; tell the world that your "beacon" shines for all.

Zizek's reverse-Baudrillardian commentary relevant to some of BK Stefans'
recent post on the WTC terrorism. Wish I cd be volunteering in my old
neighborhood, but am still grounded here in Inchon International Airport(on
9/11 our LA-bound plane went halfway across the Pacific and then had to
return to Korea).  (One of the common expressions here on the news is that
the planes' "feet are tied" still.)

Pierre. I didnt know and still dont know what to think (or even what or why
I said what I said) except that war is not the answer. I was "traumatised"
at the time seeing what was happenning then a reaction set in. My response
wasnt wise but I'm not psychologically stable: I am on medication - I am not
strictly speaking insane - but I have my moments. I feel for the people of
course but - well I'm dubious of certain things in this situation. I am
actually in agreement with you on many things I support the Palestinian
cause.
I obtained a couple of books by Robert Kelly and I am finding him very
interesting: sometimes quite moving, much beautiful poetry. Cheers, Richard.

To perpetuate anti-Afghan violence with such assumption-led questions is
obscene. To suggest the Afghani people should suffer because of the
behaviour of the Taliban is the sickest of ironies.

To complain go to:http://www.cnn.com/feedback/

The Afghans have suffered horrendously from the various fundamentalisms
of the Soviets, the mujahideen leader and prime minister from '92-'96,
Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, and the Taliban - is George Bush now to be added to
the list so he can take Kabul from a state of post-apocalypse to....? (I
keep getting this awful image of redneck kids shoving dynamite up the
ass of a dying pig, their dads away at the local KKK meet)

I would also urge people to visit, and to urge others to visit, the RAWA
site (www.rawa.org) and to e-mail them your support (rawa@rawa.org) - at
present they are receiving many extremely threatening messages from both
US right-wing fundamentalists, and Islamic fundamentalists - what chance
the Opreh Winfrey show on RAWA and the response of 300,000 Americans who
swamped their site in support, being repeated now!

For the most detailed account I've yet read of how, blinded by Cold War
ideology, the CIA nurtured Islamic fundamentalism for their singular
purpose of defeating the Russians in Afghanistan while remaining
ignorant of the inevitable consequences of such a policy, read:-

http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/96may/blowback.htm=A0

(written in 1996, after the car bombings in Riyadh, Peshawar and
Islamabad, it is scarily prescient in its warnings of future 'blowback'
actions by Islamic fundamentalists as a result of the Saudi Arabia and
USA sponsored jihad in Afghanistan)

a brief glimmer of hope this morning - on the front page of 'The
Guardian' here in the UK is the headline 'Cracks appear in the
coalition' - article includes a photo of French prime minister Lionel
Jospin and a caption quote:- 'We are not at war against Islam'. Belgian
foreign minister Louis Michel, current holder of EU presidency has said
'We are not at war' while Russian defence minister Sergei Ivanov has
said there will be no chance of the US being allowed to launch attacks
from Tajikstan, the former Soviet republic immediately north of
Afghanistan. Conspicuously absent from this list is Blair who remains
hawkish as ever - unsurprising given that the UK has continued to act in
conjunction with the US in the ongoing bombing of Iraq, has together
with the US been the major supporter of the inhumane sanctions there,
and is the world's second biggest arms dealer behind the US. =20

Joe, I fully sympathise with your sense that it is important for the
'left' to support anti-terrorist sentiment - it seems to me however that
given the apparent shakiness of the US-Euro coalition, all efforts
should be directed towards putting pressure on sympathetic politicians
to forward calls for perpetrators to be bought before newly-empowered
courts of international justice, and for them to engage in the promotion
of multi-party and multi-country talks that honestly examine how the
fervour driving terrorist actions can be diluted - anything from formal
apologies to renewed peace talks need to be pushed for - given that the
abyss is so clearly visible now, and the reasons for how we got here
becoming more so, I still want to believe an alternative political
coalition seeking to promote peace can be welded together in opposition
to the hawkish US-UK isolationist axis.

Subject:      m&r..mourn the dead

   I find Pierre Joris response to 'real' emotion profoundly maddenning, anger-inducing and blatantly racist. To start trumpeting the infantada as the dead are being buried around us, must give us pause to think how deep the wells are that he can draw on.

    Palestinians dancing in jubilation are a fact. We have the pictures. Their motives may be explained and understood, yet the fact of their delight is apparent, as it is apparent at all bombings of Israeli and other Jewish Institutions around the world. Rather than a small minority, if this demonstration was not immediately clamped down by the frightened authorities, i'm pretty certain there would have been many many 1,000's dancing in the streets. So in Bagdhad, Damasscus and unfortunately through out the Arab World. Cultures of hate and resentment and deep seated undemocratic racism boil over to extreme violence.

        Honest real emotion heals. Telling us not to see what we see, feel what we feel  will not help. Let's bury our dead... Drn..

Dear Poetics readers,

I am interested in working with writers and/or artists, especially in the
Boston area, in order to design and create some kites in response to
Tuesday's events.  I feel like these objects can help me to reconnect to
the sky and to extend benevolent habitation into our "air space."  I intend
to compose short texts to be written onto or affixed to the kites.  I have
no immediate timeline and no goal other than someday to fly all the kites
together.  Kites, with all the precarious tension they embody, seem more
safe and healing to fly than flags.  Please back-channel if interested.

I'm terrifically grateful for the writing about experiences of being in New
York from Charles, Marcella, Gary, Brian, Lee Ann, and others. I've also
found valuable the sources of analysis and information--the position of the
War Resisters League, the information on asbestos in the WTC--that have
been sent out on the list. The question I am asking myself now is how to
put this material to work--making use of one's perspective, resources, and
experience as a poet. Which are incredibly valuable, what we have variously
schooled ourselves to do for a reason, for years.

I remember well being at what felt to be at a center of concern,and
opposition, to the last national crisis of similar proportion--the Gulf
War. In the San Francisco Bay Area, as the date for American attacks
approached, and the attacks began, tens of thousands hit the streets as
they had many times since the beginnings of the anti-war movement. But this
time, the acts of opposition were drowned out by the yellow flags of
jingoism and, as Bush said, roughly, "there are those who oppose this war,
but you can't hear them." I think he said "you" rather than "we"--in other
words, there was a directive not to hear them, even if one could.

Now that I'm located in one of the areas of the country that wanted not to
hear any opposition to the politics and tactics of the Gulf War, I'm
concerned to listen for similarities and differences to that time. There
are many. From what I understand from people who were here, Detroit--where
the capacity for automated production arguably was a major factor
propelling America to victory in WWII and afterward, and people now drive
Humvees as recreational vehicles--there was a steely solidarity and
dumbed-down rhetoric that completely stultified, wiped out any
alternatives. And even now I see the same dumb rhetoric in the Detroit
papers--of good vs. evil, etc.--that is always less analytic, more invested
with an assertion of who we are than even the national norm.

There are differences, even so. The impact of the news, of course, was
total. There was a delay, then a somewhat orderly shift to a response. The
Big Three let off employees, and there was a calm but intense stream of
traffic out of the city center. People who had jobs to do did them.  There
was not, however, any sense of civic authority to direct this response--it
was a seemingly ingrained notion of appropriate action. The only untoward
event I noted was a brief episode of gas profiteering ($6 a gallon the
night of the attack), which ended in a day or so. The media was the source
of trauma--but I think this is now interpreted in two ways. We know what a
media disaster is, by this time, and we also know that the referent is
real. If there is a dissociation between the two--that we do not identify
the media trauma with the referent--that could be a hopeful sign. This is
why particular accounts are so important--to dissociate the two experiences
of trauma.

Neighborhoods around Detroit have always flown the flag. During the Gulf
War, from what I have heard, this was particularly intense. Afterward,
however, there was a shift in the practice. Many of the flagpoles that
adorn suburban houses started to fly flags that were more
fanciful--flowers, panda bears, pumpkins, an innocuous happy-face
iconography. Not monolithically the Stars and Stripes. So I am watching for
the return of the practice. Gas station flags are at half mast (there are
enormous ones). Small flags often line the roads. I have heard of women in
malls wearing flag dresses, recently purchased. Where the insignia of the
Red Wings hockey team have been flown on plastic attachments to SUVs, I
have seen some American flags--when driven at speed, evoking a cavalry
rescue, John Wayne style. You can almost hear the charge being sounded. And
of course there is the reinforcement of the Battle Hymn of the Republic
being sung on TV.

But this is not the whole story. It seems to me there is another
attitude--of evaluation, and desire for alternative perspective. Students
in my classes at Wayne are certainly interested in unpacking the
discourses, rather than suturing them together. There is considerable
discussion of not stigmatizing Arab students and residents in Detroit (a
large population, from all over the Middle East, which has been here for
decades). The university has explicitly addressed this concern.

All night long, when commercial air traffic was halted, one could hear the
roar of jets, I assume from Selkirk AFB, in nearby Macomb County. Troops
and equipment are being moved up.

I want to keep open the place of alternative analysis, as we are obviously
entering into a period of war rhetoric and its military objective--to
stultify and paralyze analysis and criticism. What I want to do in
response: build up a set of references that can be used in thinking through
the present. Yesterday, because I'm teaching the 50s and 60s, I went back
through a lot of the writings of Paul Goodman, for example. An anthology he
put together of articles from Liberation magazine in 1964 (Seeds of
Liberation) contained Albert Camus's "Neither Victims nor Executioners"--a
title that has to seem quite evocative at present. Some of it is dated, but
some entirely true of the entire post-WWII period that is the framework we
are in: "Modern nations are driven by powerful forces along the roads of
power and domination. I will not say that these forces should be furthered
or that they should be obstructed. They hardly need our help and, for the
moment, they laugh at attempts to hinder them. They will, then, continue.
But I will ask only this simple question: what if these forces wind up in a
dead end . . .?" Camus advocates an individual act of choice--not to join
the party or accomplices of murder--that at least asserts that such an
alternative is possible.

I don't think that an act of choice is sufficient, although it is important
to think that there is such a thing as an act of choice. There are also the
logics that we are embedded in, and cannot choose. Here action also needs
to be understood as possible in another sense, and undertaken. Toward that
end, I am interested in what Goodman, in another book, says about the role
of the writer:

"Writers are linguistic analysts and know the folk wisdom and superstition
that exist in common vocabulary and grammar. As General Semanticists, they
are critical of the rhetoric of the street, the mass media, and official
institutions. They understand, more than most people, what cannot be said,
what is not being said though it ought to be, what is verbalized
experience, and what is mere words. They can detect when there is really an
idea and an argument rather than a cloud of phrases. They can date a
passage and show a forgery. As psychologists of language they are sensitive
to how people come on when they talk or write, the ploys they use, and the
postures they strike. They can hear the personal that is expressed in
habits of syntax, and the personal inhibition or freedom that is told by
the breathing and rhythm of sentences and the quality of metaphor. They can
judge the clarity or confusion or spurious clarity in an exposition. They
are sociologists of language and can recognize the social background in
vocabulary, pronunciation, and routine formulas. / At the same time as they
know all this, however, in their own writing they must let their speech
come spontaneously: it is free speech, though they monitor it critically."
(Speaking and Language: Defence of Poetry, 1971).

Goodman's political alternative is spontaneity, which solves the question
of internal censorship and external valuation of the authenticity of
speech, at the same time. While everything in this passage is, I think,
baseline politics to many poets, there is also an understanding that the
social character of "language" is precisely what makes spontaneity not an
automatic alternative. And we have continued to explore that tension
between the call to authenticity and the experience of being embedded in
contexts, being spoken, being subject to discourses outside and beyond oneself.

I would like to build up some resources that would help think through the
present. A more recent title that came to hand, is Roy Gutman and David
Rieff, eds., Crimes of War: What the Public Should Know (Norton, 1999)--an
incredibly lucid discussion of acts of war, rules of engagement, war
crimes, international law, and so forth. I would be grateful for other such
resources, and also for specific urls (War Resisters League, Chomsky, other
perspectives, asbestos reports, poetic responses, and so forth) that could
then be brought together in a single place.

Thanks, Barrett

Subject:  A view from Afghanistan


A sobering essay forwarded by a UC Berkeley professor:

Dear Friends,

The following was sent to me by my friend Tamim Ansary.  Tamim is an
Afghani-American writer.  He is also one of the most brilliant
people I know in this life.  When he writes, I read.  When he
talks, I listen.
Here is his take on Afghanistan and the whole mess we are in.
-Gary T.


Dear Gary and whoever else is on this email thread:

I've been hearing a lot of talk about "bombing Afghanistan back to the
Stone Age." Ronn Owens, on KGO Talk Radio today, allowed that this would
mean killing innocent people, people who had nothing to do with this
atrocity, but "we're at war, we have to accept collateral damage. What
else can we do?"  Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing
whether we "have the belly to do what must be done."

And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I am
from Afghanistan, and even though I've lived here for 35 years I've
never lost track of what's going on there. So I want to tell anyone who
will listen how it all looks from where I'm standing.

I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. There is no
doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in
New York. I agree that something must be done about those monsters.

But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan.  They're not even the
government of Afghanistan.  The Taliban are a cult of ignorant
psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997. Bin Laden is a political
criminal with a plan.  When you think Taliban, think Nazis. When you
think Bin Laden, think Hitler. And when you think "the people of
Afghanistan" think "the Jews in the concentration camps."   It's not
only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity. They
were the first victims of the perpetrators. They would exult if someone
would come in there, take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of
international thugs holed up in their country.

Some say, why don't the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban? The
answer is, they're starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated, suffering.
A few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there are 500,000
disabled orphans in Afghanistan--a country with no economy, no food.
There are millions of widows.  And the Taliban has been burying these
widows alive in mass graves.  The soil is littered with land mines, the
farms were all destroyed by the Soviets.  These are a few of the reasons
why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban.

We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone
Age. Trouble is, that's been done. The Soviets took care of it already.
Make the Afghans suffer? They're already suffering. Level their houses?
Done. Turn their schools into piles of rubble? Done.  Eradicate their
hospitals? Done.  Destroy their infrastructure? Cut them off from
medicine and health care?  Too late. Someone already did all that.

New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs.  Would they at
least get the Taliban? Not likely. In today's Afghanistan, only the
Taliban eat, only they have the means to move around.  They'd slip away
and hide. Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans, they
don't move too fast, they don't even have wheelchairs. But flying over
Kabul and dropping bombs wouldn't really be a strike against the
criminals who did this horrific thing. Actually it would only be making
common cause with the Taliban--by raping once again the people they've
been raping all this time

So what else is there? What can be done, then? Let me now speak with
true fear and trembling. The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there
with ground troops. When people speak of "having the belly to do what
needs to be done" they're thinking in terms of having the belly to kill
as many as needed.  Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about
killing innocent people. Let's pull our heads out of the sand. What's
actually on the table is Americans dying. And not just because some
Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin
Laden's hideout.  It's much bigger than that folks. Because to get any
troops to Afghanistan, we'd have to go through Pakistan. Would they let
us? Not likely. The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first. Will
other Muslim nations just stand by? You see where I'm going. We're
flirting with a world war between Islam and the West.

And guess what: that's Bin Laden's program. That's exactly what he
wants. That's why he did this.  Read his speeches and statements. It's
all right there.  He really believes Islam would beat the west. It might
seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam
and the West, he's got a billion soldiers.  If the west wreaks a
holocaust in those lands, that's a billion people with nothing left to
lose, that's even better from Bin Laden's point of view.  He's probably
wrong, in the end the west would win, whatever that would mean, but the
war would last for years and millions would die, not just theirs but
ours. Who has the belly for that? Bin Laden does. Anyone else?

  JEHAD

  This is an age, our canonist's new dictum
  Assures us, of the pen: in our world now
  The sword has no more virtue.--Has it not reached
  Our pious oracle's ear, that in the Mosque
  Such sermonizing nowadays has grown
  Rhymeless and reasonless?  Where, in a Muslim's hand,
  Will he find dagger or rifle? and if there were,
  Our hearts have lost all memory of delight
  In death.  To one whose nerves falter at even
  An infidel cut down, who would exclaim
  "Die like a Muslim!" Preach relinquishment
  Of such crusades to him whose bloody fist
  Menaces earth!  Europe, swathed cap-a-pie
  In mail, mounts guard over her glittering reign
  Of falsehood; we enquire of our divine,
  So tender of Christendom; if for the East
  War is unhallowed, is not war unhallowed
  For Western arms? and if your goal be truth,
  Is this the right road--Europe's faults are all glossed,
  And all Islam's held to so strict an audit?

              THE DELIRIUM OF THE X-TREME
"Every extreme attitude is a flight from the self."
            Eric Hoffer

"There is no delirium that does not pass through peoples, races, and
tribes, and that does not haunt universal history. All delirium is world
historical, a 'displacement of races and continents."

"Delirium is a disease, the disease par excellance, whenever it erects a
race it claims is pure and dominant."
            Gilles Deleuze



I was in the hardware store yesterday and saw colored duct tape that was
called 'X-treme Duct tape.'  I later had to get gas at my local
convenience store and noticed a sticker on the door for an x-treme sport
drink. I suppose the sport for which it was intended was X-treme also as
were the shoes you could be wearing or the x-treme car you will later get
in to go to your x-treme job.

The 'extreme' indeed seems to be at its rhetorical extreme these days,
flourished no doubt by the substitution of 'ex-' by 'x-', the x having
it's own charismatic/chiasmatic signature effect these days.

The affect found most often at the intensities which define the extreme is
delirium, the defining feature of which is, according to some sources,
"the disturbance of consciousness, accompanied by a change in cognition
that cannot be accounted for by pre-existing or evolving dementia."  That
is, it's an irruption or intervention into consciousness of states marked
by confusion, agitation, altered levels of consciousness, and perceptual
disturbances.

Webster's New International claims that delirium is to "make the furrow
awry in plowing, to deviate from the straight line" - literally: de- as in
from, and lira, a line or furrow. More clinically, it is defined as "a
temporary state of extreme mental excitement, marked by restlessness,
confused speech, and hallucinations," a symptom rather than a cause.

'Extreme' is listed as "at the outermost, farthest; at the utmost point,
edge, or border" and as the "utmost in degree; of the very best or worst
that can exist in reality or in imagination; excessive; immoderate" and
"last; beyond which there is none."

Poor old longshoreman/philosopher of the common man Eric Hoffer no doubt
thought that extremity in the service of the self was oxymoronic since it
led to the dissolution of subject formations. Deleuze would no doubt agree
that was precisely the point, coming from a different 'becoming.'

What is at stake in the passage to (wished for at the very least) extremes
and delirium is stated succintly in this passage from Roberto Calasso
concerning Nietzsche's last work and descent into madness: "What he seems
to have wanted to demonstrate visibly is the passage [....] from a theory
that is radical but still respectful of formal conventions to a PRACTISE
of an unprecedented nature "  (The Forty Nine Steps) We now know that that
is also the place of monsters ('monstration' being precisely that making
visible of sui generis passage.)

At any rate, 'extremes' and 'deliriums' perhaps (or not) exist now in the
same proportions they always have. One difference seems to be the place
they occupy in our collective imaginations through the continual
monstrations of technology and the subsequent (?) wish of many to be on
the very edge of  whatever. Maybe Judge Schreber was right: we are all on
our way to becoming his children.

Send us your borderline thoughts, your holey digressions, your spit-stuck,
star-struck (or dis-astered) web sol/vent/utions, and unprecedented
practices, your more considered academic approaches, your speedtraps and
potholes at the front and the back of the bell curve, yearning to be free,
fried, or filled.
--------------
"These visions, these auditions are not a private matter but form the
figures of history and a geography that are ceaselessly reinvented. It is
a delirium that invents them, as a process driving words, from one end of
the universe to the other. They are events at the edge of language. But
when delirium falls back into the clinical state, words no longer open out
onto anything, we no longer hear or see anything through them except a
night whose history, colors, and songs have been lost."

After a Passage in Baudelaire

Ship, leaving or arriving, of my lover,
my soul, leaving or coming into this harbor,
among your lights and shadows   shelterd,
at home in your bulk, the cunning
regularity and symmetry thruout
of love's design, of will, of your
attractive cells and chambers     .

riding forward, darkest of shades
over the shadowd waters     .
into the light, neat, symmetrically
arranged about your watery reflections
disturbing your own image, moving as you are

.     What passenger, what sailor,
looks out into the swirling currents round you
as if into those depths into a mirror?

What lights in what port-holes
raise in my mind again     hunger and impatience?
to make my bed down again, there, beyond me,
as if this room too, my bedroom, my lamp at my side,
were among those lights sailing out
                     away from me.

We too, among the others, passengers
in that *charme infini et mystérieux,*
in that suitable symmetry, that precision
everywhere, the shining fittings, the fit
of lights and polisht surfaces to the dark,
to the flickering shadows of them,
we too, unfaithful to me, sailing away,
leaving me.

*L'idée poétique,* the idea of a poetry,
that rises from the movement, from the
outswirling curves and imaginary figures
round this ship, this fate, this sure thing,

*est l'hypothèse d'une être vaste, immense,

compliqué, mais eurythmique.*

--Robert Duncan, from *Roots and Branches*  (1964)

Thanks to everyone for their thoughtful posts amid the terror and sadness.

I may have just missed their names on recent posts, but has anyone heard

     We Need the Rule of Law, Not the Rule of War
     by James Carroll

     HOW WE LOVE our country! For days now, we Americans, while mourning
and shuddering, have felt the
     accumulating weight of our patriotic devotion. We are joined in the
shocking recognition of what a rare and
     precious treasure is the United States of America. Our nation's sudden
vulnerability makes us shrug off, just as
     suddenly, the habit of taking for granted its nobility. We see it in
the throat-choking empty place of the New York
     skyline and in the gaping wound of the building beside Arlington
Cemetery. We see it in the grimy faces of the
     resolute rescue workers and in the implication that doomed airline
passengers fought back against hi-jackers. We
     see it in the splendid diversity of our features, our accents, our
beliefs, our responses, even. Never has the
     national motto seemed more true: Out of many, one.

     But so far our main expression of this intense patriotism has been
oddly in tension with its inner meaning, for the
     thing we treasure above all about America at this moment is the way it
measures its hope by principles of
     democracy, tolerance, law, respect for the other, and even social
compassion. Our supreme patriotic gesture in this
     crisis has been a nearly universal call for war, and indeed, the
growing sentiment for war, fueled by the rhetoric of
     our highest leaders, may soon be embodied in a formal congressional
declaration of war. Before we go further, we
     should think carefully about why we are heading down this path and
where it is likely to lead. Do the rhetoric of war
     and the actions it sets in motion really serve the urgent purpose of
stopping terrorism? And is the launching of war
     really the only way to demonstrate our love for America?

     First, let me state the obvious. The nearly worldwide consensus that
the terrorist attacks on New York and
     Washington must be met with force is entirely correct. The network of
suicidal mass murderers, however large and
     wherever hidden, must be eliminated. But force can be exercised
decisively and overwhelmingly in another context
     than that of ''war.'' One of the great advances in civilization
occurred when human beings found a way to channel
     unavoidable violence away from ''war'' and toward a new,
counterbalancing context embodied in the idea of ''law.''
     The distinction may seem too fine to be relevant in the aftermath of
this catastrophe, but it is after catastrophe that
     the distinction matters most. The difference between ''war'' and
''law'' is not the use of force. The United States of
     America, with its world allies, should be embarked not on a war but on
an unprecedented, swift, sure, and massive
     campaign of law enforcement. As the term ''law enforcement'' implies,
the proper use of force would be of the
     essence in this campaign.

     Why does this distinction matter? Four reasons:

     War, by definition, is an activity undertaken against a political or
social entity, while the terrorist network responsible
     for this catastrophe, from all reports, is a coalition of individuals,
perhaps a large one. Law enforcement, by
     definition, is an activity undertaken against just such individuals or
networks. By clothing our response to the
     terrorist acts in the rhetoric of war, we make it far more likely that
members of groups associated by extrinsic factors
     with the perpetrators (Arabs, Muslims, Afghans, Pakistanis, etc.) will
suffer terrible consequences, from being
     bombed in Kabul to being discriminated against in Boston. Furthermore,
the rhetoric of war, as it falls on the ears
     of such people (a billion Muslims), makes it all the more likely that
they will see America only as their enemy.

     War, by definition, is relatively imprecise. Steps can be taken to
limit ''collateral damage,'' but the method of war, in
     fact, is to bring pressure to bear against a hostile power structure
by inflicting suffering on the society of which it is
     part. History shows that once wars begin, violence becomes general. As
President Bush threatened, no
     distinctions are made. In law enforcement, distinctions remain of the
essence. Law enforcement submits to
     disciplines that are jettisoned in war. Do we really have the right to
jettison such disciplines now?

     War, similarly, is less concerned with procedure than with result.More
plainly, in war the ends justify the means. In
     law enforcement, the end remains embodied in the means, which is why
procedures are so scrupulously observed
     in criminal justice activity. To respond to a terrorist's violation of
the social order with further violations of that order
     means the terrorist has won.

     War inevitably generates its own momentum, which has a way of
inhumanely overwhelming the humane purposes
     for which the war is begun in the first place. In the death-ground of
combat violence, self-criticism can seem like
     fatal self-doubt, so the savage momentum of war is rarely recognized
until too late. The rule of unintended
     consequences universally applies in war. Law enforcement, on the other
hand, with its system of checks and
     balances between police and courts, is inevitably self-critical. The
moral link between act and consequence is far
     more likely to be protected.

     What does winning a war against terrorism mean? How has hatred of
America become a source of meaning for
     vast numbers whose poverty already amounts to a state of war? Must a
massive campaign of unleashed violence
     become America's new source of meaning, too? The World Trade Center
was a symbol of the social, economic,
     and political hope Americans treasure, a hope embodied above all in
law. To win the struggle against terrorism
     means inspiring that same hope in the hearts of all who do not have
it. How we respond to this catastrophe will
     define our patriotism, shape the century, and memorialize our beloved
dead.

>I hope, as poets, that we find a way to participate in some way in using
the things we have been thinking about -- on this list, in the poems,
concerning community, justice, globalization, etc. -- in a good way.

this can't be said enough, should be said more

i'm in san diego, watched from afar as most did, have lost no one
immediately close to me but, like many, know some who know some -- and out
here, aside from our own airport closing and the bomb threat at the zoo on
Thursday, as well as at a nearby school, our most immediate involvement has
been, first, the victims on the planes on their way back to the west coast,
and the news released yesterday that three of the hijackers lived about 5
miles west of me and attended community college classes in the district i
and some of my friends have taught in, teaching english, over the last few
years -- the city also sent relief firefighters, jammed our blood banks, and
welcomed one carrier home while another gets deployed to the gulf

yesterday the zoo re-opened its doors and many flocked -- i can't imagine
how or why anyone would go, and i question if that is the kind of
participation we need, but i also question the high school football games in
texas, and other ways a grieving/coping people return to the "normal life"
in efforts to send messages, to themselves and terrorists, that our way of
life will not be swayed, diverted, destroyed -- or are these efforts to
avoid/deflect the message sent so clearly on tuesday? -- i don't know --
parents of the high school players, for their part, said it was for the
kids, to give some diversion, after the long and horrid week, while the
parents continued the grieving, knowing better -- i don't know if this is
the right kind of participation either, for us or our kids, but i can't
pretend to know enough at all about what's appropriate now

we're struggling here, like others, with that question of what to do, of
what's appropriate, of what's necessary, of how to participate -- i know
that it's not enough for me to hold old class rosters up to the computer
screen to check the FBI list against my own (no names matched) -- i know
it's not enough to sit in front of my television and verbally chide it for
turning what Dan Rather insisted, on tuesday, was "not a movie" back into
one on friday, even though these are the real ways of channeling information
that lead to climates of misinformation and misunderstanding in which
horrible deeds like these can come to pass

it might be enough, this week and here on this list, to think about and
through all of this (reading through the messages here, reading itself, as
taylor brady wrote a few days ago, has been a small but important help) --
but to push what brian wrote, how do we use "the things we have been
thinking about -- on this list, in the poems, concerning community, justice,
globalization, etc. -- in a good way"? -- it's a practical question, and i
think it needs to be addressed now -- if, as we all fear, more is on the
way, then what are the strategies for battle readiness, for poets/writers,
for all, in the weeks to come? -- there is and never has been a normal life
to return to, so where do we go from here?

i'm not sure where to begin -- it might start with channeling as hard as we
can the idea that, as maya angelou said last night talking with ted koppel,
there's a difference between justice and revenge and we must work for the
first and not the second -- with so many out for revenge already, against
those who are innocent, in the streets and mosques across the country, how
can we as poets/writers discourage hate and protect those who have hurt no
one?

i hope those who teach (poetry or anything) or work in settings that allow
for discussion and organization will channel thoughts into actions and take
what the thinking here offers out into the lives and communities that can
most benefit -- that will be our goal here

what else can we do? -- what are the strategies for action and readiness
that this group can best address?

Channel 7, Miami, with feeds from Channel 5, NY, both Fox:

Banner ad across the screen (this obviously from Net organization in the
first place): AMERICA UNITED.

To the left: 7 in a red circle. Beneath 7: Fox News Channel slowly
rotating. Scrolling text at bottom.

It is precisely this: AMERICA UNITED or "talking about what they have all
collectively been going through."

It is precisely this: What is America? What sort of unification? What sort
of agreement?

Did this happen to Lower Manhattan, Manhattan, New York City, New York
State, The United States, North America, "The Americas," the "World"?
We are suddenly, catastrophically, thrown into "The United States" as
AMERICA - we jump to the level of the _army,_ to national-patriotisms,
to a level silencing many of us who disagree, who fear both the rhetoric
and its underlying repetition of violence.

As if the opposite of patriotism is anti-patriotic, the opposition of
unity is destruction, the opposite of America is anti-American. As if we
are governed by these dualities.

We are not; enough comes through back-channel to indicate there are a lot
of us who mourn but think otherwise, who do not feel patriotic in the
sense of this UNITED, who may feel fear more than anything.

We should keep this in mind.

>A profession is more than a job -- it is a community and a culture.
>Professions serve society by pooling knowledge among their members,
>and by creating incentives to synthesize new knowledge.  They also
>help their members to build networks, find jobs, recruit staff, start
>collaborative projects, and organize around the issues that affect
>them.  In a world without change or innovation, professions would
>not be necessary.  But in a world where change and innovation are
>ever more intense, every occupation needs more of the institutions and
>culture of traditional professions such as law, medicine, engineering,
>education, librarianship, business, and architecture.
>
>Every profession has leaders.  In a formal sense, the elected officers
>of a professional society are the leaders of that profession.  Because
>a profession is fundamentally about knowledge, however, the true
>leaders of a profession are the thought leaders: the individuals who
>synthesize the thinking of the profession's members and articulate
>directions for the future.  Sometimes a profession will elect its
>thought leaders to official positions.  But often the thought leaders
>prefer to lead through writing and speaking, cutting-edge projects,
>and dialogue.  Leadership means not just talking but listening, and
>not just vision but consensus.  A leader builds a web of relationships
>within the profession and articulates the themes that are emerging in
>the thinking of the profession as a whole.
>
>In a knowledge-intensive world of ceaseless innovation and change,
>every professional must be a leader.  This is not a universally
>popular idea.  Some people say, "leadership is fine for others,
>but I just want a job".  I want to argue that it doesn't work that
>way.  The skills that the leader exercises in building a critical
>mass of opinion around emerging issues are the same skills that
>every professional needs to stay employed at all.  In the old
>days the leadership-averse could hide out in bureaucracies.  But as
>institutions are turned inside out by technology, globalization, and
>rising public and client expectations of every sort, the refuges are
>disappearing.  Every professional's job is now the front lines, and
>the skills of leadership must become central to everyone's conception
>of themselves as a professional.
>
>But how?  It is well-known that simply declaring yourself a leader
>will not cause anyone to follow you.  The process of becoming a leader
>doesn't happen overnight, but it is perfectly methodical.  Here is
>a six-step recipe.  Things aren't really this rigid in practice, but
>you'll have no trouble varying the recipe once you get used to it.
>
>(1) Pick an issue.  You need an issue that the profession as a whole
>is not really thinking about, but which is going to be the center
>of attention in five years.  The issue could be technical, strategic,
>managerial, policy-related, or all of the above.  It could be a
>problem or an opportunity or both.  It could be a new method or a
>whole new area of practice.  It should be fairly specific, though, and
>should directly address the day-to-day work of people in some segment
>of the profession.  "Technology" is too big.  You can find an issue in
>four ways:
>
>   (a) Talk to a large number of dynamic practitioners and notice a
>pattern in what they are saying.
>
>   (b) Talk to people at your school.  One purpose of a professional
>school is to be the early-warning system for the profession -- the
>surveillance center where emerging issues are articulated, researched,
>and taught.  Many issues that you take for granted as lecture and
>paper topics in your classes actually represent the farthest horizon
>so far as most practitioners are concerned.
>
>   (c) Talk to people in other professions to find issues that are
>going to be important for your profession.
>
>   (d) Draw on your own experience and values to articulate an issue
>that nobody else is talking about.  Maybe you are simply anticipating
>concerns that everybody else will be discovering independently in a
>few years, or maybe you are building something new that wouldn't have
>happened without you.  In either case, if the issue is going to be
>important to your profession in five years, you'll be doing a public
>service by getting out in front of it.
>
>In short, feel free to identify an issue that you care about and
>put yourself in charge of raising the profession's awareness of it.
>If putting yourself in charge feels arrogant, that's just because
>you're not used to it.  Focus on the issue and you'll be fine.
>
>(2) Having chosen your issue, start a project to study it.  You might
>do this in context of a term paper or an independent study, or you
>might organize it through the local student chapter of a professional
>association.  Or you might simply do it on your own time.  It's hard
>work, yes, but it's an investment.  See if a local faculty member will
>sign on as an advisor to the project, and if you can use the faculty
>member's name in talking to people.
>
>(3) Do your library work so you know any conventional wisdom that's
>out there.  Then talk to some working professionals who are facing
>the issue, especially if they have spoken publicly about an aspect of
>it.  You can find these people by asking the faculty in your school;
>it's their job to know everyone.  If the faculty are reticent at
>first to unleash you on their contacts, then work your own contacts,
>for example through your fellow students or the professional society.
>You can also find relevant people by reading professional publications,
>attending conferences, and searching Web sites.  Tell them that your
>project is pulling together the profession's experience with the
>issue, and ask if you can interview them.  Have a good, focused talk,
>make serious notes, ask if they want to keep anything confidential,
>give them your card, and promise to keep in touch.  Why are they
>willing to talk to you?  Because you're working on an important issue,
>and because you're associated with a professional school, which is
>a center of thinking and networking for the field.  Use the symbolic
>power of the university while you're still associated with it.
>
>(4) Pull together what you've heard.  Nobody is expecting you to
>solve the problems.  The emphasis is more on questions than answers.
>You will contribute simply by defining the whole scope of the
>problems that people are facing.  Make a taxonomy and give examples.
>Talk about what people are doing to address the problems.  Focus
>on practice: the actual decisions that working professionals will
>have to make, and the full range of considerations that they will
>have to take into account.  Most of these considerations will seem
>obvious taken in isolation, but many people will be grateful to have
>a complete list in front of them.  Remember that professionals, no
>matter how creative and intuitive they are, have to justify their
>decisions in a rational way, giving reasons why they have made one
>choice rather than another.  You'll do a service just by laying out
>the choices and reasons.  Talk about the consequences people see
>for the future.  Just impose some order.  Faculty in your school can
>probably help you with this.  Write clearly and concisely, and get
>someone who can write well to copyedit your work.
>
>(5) Circulate the result.  Send copies to the people who helped you.
>Call it a draft or interim report if you want.  Give credit to the
>people whose ideas you've written down.  Then follow up.  Get further
>comments.  Now write some short columns for professional publications.
>Describe your project and summarize the issue.  Explain why the issue
>is becoming important.  Concisely present the dangers and opportunities
>for the profession.  Your goal is to lead: to present the profession
>with a valid issue that calls for action.  Again, you don't need to
>specify what the right action is.  You only need to give form to the
>issue.  Make sure your published columns provide a permanent e-mail
>address where people can reach you, and ideally the URL for a Web page
>where you've collected materials related to the issue.
>
>(6) Get invited to speak at meetings.  Correspond with people who
>have contacted you after reading your work.  Meet more people who
>appreciate the significance of the issue.  If you hear about someone
>who is working on a similar issue, make friends.  Show them that
>you've read their work, give them due credit, and explore how your
>projects complement one another.  Expand your network to include
>your profession's clients and peers.  As you take in everyone's
>perspectives, let your understanding of the issue grow and evolve.
>Come up with many different honest ways of explaining the issue
>and clear answers to the standard questions you get asked.  Don't
>try to convert people who don't get it.  You may be a voice in the
>wilderness for a while, but keep building networks and synthesizing
>ideas.  Your energetic and responsible approach will make you a magnet
>for intelligent people.  As interest in the issue accelerates, build
>institutions around it.  See if the people in your network want to
>start a moderated mailing list.  Organize a panel discussion about
>it at a professional meeting.  And so on.  Keep going until the issue
>either matures or disappears.  Then find another issue and start over.
>
>That's the procedure.  You should always have at least one issue that
>you are developing in this way.  In doing so, you are helping the
>profession to think out loud about its problems and potentials, and
>you are also helping to knit the profession together by establishing
>connections among the people who are thinking about the issues on the
>horizon.  You are also making yourself a strong job candidate.  You
>are building knowledge, and you are building networks.  One purpose
>of a professional school is to build such networks, and by helping you
>the school helps itself.
>
>If you've spent your whole life going to school and toiling at normal
>jobs, then you might find the prospect of leadership nerve-wracking.
>Most schools and jobs are afraid of you, so they encourage a dependent
>attitude where you wait around for other people to give you things.
>Of course they don't entirely succeed; no institution can completely
>extinguish your human agency.  Even so, few schools or jobs actively
>train people to take the initiative by organizing people around
>emerging issues.  Yet successful people have exercised leadership
>in this way for all of recorded history.  The methods of leadership
>that I have described are not widely publicized, and many courses
>that supposedly teach leadership skills omit them entirely.  But they
>are out there, roaring at full throttle just below the surface, and
>you can learn them by watching any successful person in action.  I'm
>just hoping that by reading this you'll learn them a little faster.
>
>As you advance in your profession, you will be organizing people in
>more sophisticated ways around more sophisticated issues.  As such,
>it will be important to cultivate your intellectual life.  Leadership
>is such a rare skill that it doesn't matter whether you are a genius
>in your own right.  Leadership is process, and the whole point is
>that you're not figuring out all the answers yourself.  Accordingly,
>you will need to develop a brain trust -- smart and knowledgeable
>people that you can turn to when you need expert judgements.  This
>is one reason to stay in touch with the faculty at your school, and
>with the smart people who pass through the school while you are there.
>One good way to start a brain trust is to organize a speaker series.
>Fearlessly assess your intellectual strengths and weaknesses, and then
>make professional friends whose intellectual strengths complement your
>own.  Your contribution is to facilitate a large-scale movement within
>the profession, and that's what makes the difference in the long run.
>
>As you become a leader, you will also face ethical issues.  Leadership
>has a bad name; people associate it with dishonesty, manipulation,
>and "politics".  That's because so many "leaders" prefer to surf
>on issues, extracting the social energy around them for their own
>benefit, rather than being a positive and constructive force in the
>community.  Once you've built a network and evolved some rhetoric,
>you can get a way with a lot of selfishness.  People will probably
>even praise you for it.  You can settle down to a life of mutual
>back-scratching with your similarly-networked cronies, going through
>the motions and never giving a serious thought to the community again.
>But that's no good.  Your job is to model positive leadership.  You
>have no doubt heard it explained that true leadership is "selfless".
>I haven't emphasized that theme so far, for the simple reason that
>it's useless to demand that people be selfless leaders until they
>understand the six-step process that makes them leaders at all.  Now
>that you do understand the process, and especially once you become
>accustomed to actually doing it, it's time to put some content into
>it.  Use your connections to help people who deserve help.  Promote
>all ideas that you find valuable, whether they reinforce your issues
>or not.  Keep trying to understand your issues more deeply, and ask
>yourself whether the world is changing.  Don't be an ego freak.  And
>write down what you learn along the way.
>
>Why do I argue that the modern world requires all professionals
>to engage in leadership?  Before the Internet, professionals had
>to be generalists.  Problems would arise, and you had to solve them.
>Now, however, the institutions and infrastructures of your profession
>easily bring professional knowledge to bear wherever it is needed.
>To succeed in your career, you need more than the skills that you got
>in school -- you need to be the world expert in something.  Knowledge
>is global, it's growing exponentially, and nobody can pack all of
>the necessary knowledge into their heads.  So everyone's going to
>specialize.  Specialization doesn't mean narrowness: it means reaching
>out in many directions, talking to many kinds of people, and weaving
>together the threads that make your issue matter.  "Leadership" used
>to mean something unique: the army had one leader and everyone else
>followed.  Today, however, knowledge is multiplying so fast that we
>need more leaders than we can possibly produce.  Every leader can
>feel important, and genuinely be important, and everyone is a leader,
>including you.
>
>
>Here are some books and articles that might be useful.
>
>Networking on the Network.  This is a much longer article that I wrote
>about professional networking for students in PhD programs.  Although
>most of the detailed instructions are specific to the research world,
>the underlying philosophy will carry over into the professional world.
>On the Web at <http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/network.html>.
>
>Peter Block, Flawless Consulting: A Guide to Getting Your Expertise
>Used, Austin: Learning Concepts, 1981.  Though written for management
>consultants, this book has valuable things to say about the feelings
>that come up in any kind of professional work, and how to use them
>honestly for everyone's benefit.
>
>Donna Fisher and Sandy Vilas, Power Networking, Austin: Mountain
>Harbour, 1992.  This is the best all-around book on the subject of
>professional neworking.  It abstracts a long list of guidelines that
>apply pretty widely across professions.
>
>Roger Fisher and William Ury, Getting to Yes: Negotating Agreement
>Without Giving In, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1981.  This is the
>classic book on negotiating.  Its core message is that you should
>negotiate on the basis of interests and not on positions, so that
>negotiation becomes cooperative problem-solving.  If you lead then
>you'll need these skills.
>
>Ford Harding, Rain Making: The Professional's Guide to Attracting New
>Clients, Holbrook, MA: Bob Adams, 1994.  The way to get ahead is to
>do something new and tell everyone about it.  This is a pretty good
>introduction to the process, with a focus on publishing an article
>and developing professional networks.
>
>Linda A. Hill, Becoming a Manager: Mastery of a New Identity, Boston:
>Harvard Business School, 1992.  As a professional you'll have probably
>a manager, and soon enough you'll probably be a manager yourself.
>Your job is to deal with these relationships in a mutually beneficial
>way while also maximizing your own autonomy.  This is a study of new
>managers getting used to their jobs, and it's a good source of insight
>into these issues.
>
>Robert Jackall, Moral Mazes: The World of Corporate Managers, New
>York: Oxford University Press, 1988.  This is a terrific book about
>the ethical issues that will surround you in the organizational world.
>Once you understand these issues, you will see trouble coming much
>further off, while you can still make your own decisions about it.
>
>Tom Jackson, Guerrilla Tactics in the New Job Market, second edition,
>New York: Bantam, 1991.  This is an excellent book about finding
>a job; though it is out of print, you can probably find a used copy
>online.  Sending dozens of resumes to personnel departments is one
>approach, but a much better approach is systematic networking and
>inside research.
>
>Ronald L. Krannich and Caryl Rae Krannich, The New Network Your Way to
>Job and Career Success, Manassas Park, VA: Impact Publications, 1993.
>Another good book on networking for job-seekers, with a fair amount of
>concrete, useful advice.
>
>Charles Spinosa, Fernando Flores, and Hubert L. Dreyfus, Disclosing
>New Worlds: Entrepreneurship, Democratic Action, and the Cultivation
>of Solidarity, Cambridge: MIT Press, 1997.  If you can get past the
>cult-like hagiography, this book provides a rather different analysis
>of leadership from mine, or at least presents a different emphasis,
>starting from the creative discovery that happens in the actual process
>of leadership.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pierre! As my astute (and, not
insignificantly, Canadian) boyfriend pointed out recently, there is perhaps
another image we might want to superimpose over that of the same group of
Palestinians we're seeing over and over (anyone notice how it's always
followed by some sort of "Arab-Americans are humans too" plea for
tolerance?):  Overjoyed Americans cheering in a Texas bar as U.S. bombs
explode across Baghdad. I assume these are relatives of the people who stop
to yell obscenities at my friends and  I when we stand on street corners
with signs that read: U.S. Sanctions Kill 150 Iraqi Children Every Day.

Subject: Re: It's 8:23 in New York

Richard -- your response is exactly what every war-mongering hawk in this
country wants. It is extremely saddening to me &, I would think, to most if
not all people on this list and beyond. But not only saddening (there is
little room for sadness left, the many death of the recent days having taken
the lion's share of that emotion) -- your response is profoundly maddening,
anger-inducing for its blatant racism.  I do not have the leisure right now
to compose a long reply -- there are more urgent things to be taken care
of -- but I will paste a article by Nigel Parry s from the Intifada website
below, to show how wrong, misinformed & biased your comments really are. Two
days after the events, and while still mourning the dead in NYC, Washington
D.C. and Pennsylvania, it seems to me that what we as writers, poets,
intellectuals have to do most urgently is to try  to counter, to the best of
our possibility & with every mean at our disposal, the racist discourse of
jingoistic hate that is threatening to overwhelm this country and serve as
alibi for the US Government's military response. -- Pierre Joris

from today's edition of "The Electronic Intifada"
[http://electronicintifada.net/coveragetrends/rejoicing.html

The Palestinian people, as a whole, portrayed as supportive of the attacks
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon

Written by Nigel Parry

12 September 2001 -- Yesterday and today, following the inhumane use of
passenger planes as flying missiles to attack people visiting and working in
the World Trade Center buildings in New York and in the Pentagon in
Washington, most of the media broadcast footage depicting Palestinians
celebrating.

The brief footage was typically broadcast cyclically and used as an
interview aid, with anchors asking U.S. government officials and others how
they felt about the images.

Almost universally on U.S. networks, anchors presented the footage as if it
were representative of all Palestinians, additionally failing to note any
context to the images.

A number of points must be made, first about the actual footage:
There are three million Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and West Bank
including Jerusalem, one million Palestinians living inside the borders of
Israel, and another four million Palestinian refugees living elsewhere in
the world, including the United States. The footage in question depicted
between 20 and 40 individuals.


The Palestinians in the footage were mostly young children. Most of their
behaviour in the footage appeared to be no different from how Palestinian
children always behave when foreign journalists turn up in their towns,
crowding and smiling at the camera and giving the victory sign that has been
a symbol of Palestinian steadfastness under Israeli military occupation
since the first Intifada in 1987. There is not a single reporter with any
experience of carrying a camera into the Palestinian West Bank under any
circumstance who couldn't get similar footage on any day they visited the
occupied territories.


Where genuine rejoicing at the attacks was indeed apparent in the footage,
anchors interpreting the footage made no effort to offer any context or
background to the images, nor any attempt to separate those Palestinians
portrayed from Palestinians as a whole. A comparable situation would be
television anchors angrily reacting to scenes of the 1991 riots in Los
Angeles, lamenting that "blacks do not respect law and order", while failing
to note the preceding attack on Rodney King or endemic racial profiling of
the black community in the U.S. by police forces.


The overwhelming number of Palestinians, like people of all nationalities,
were sickened by the events in New York and Washington. Palestinians with
relatives in New York and Washington spent much of yesterday worriedly
trying to phone to check they were safe, exactly as many Americans did.
Palestinian citizens of the United States will also turn out to be among the
victims of the tragedy. Whatever a group of 20-40 Palestinian children
happened to be doing yesterday morning in Nablus or Ein Al-Hilweh Refugee
Camp in Lebanon is no more representative of all Palestinians than the Klu
Klux Klan rally -- which happened recently just down the road from where I
live, in St. Paul, Minnesota -- is representative of all Americans.


In addition, there is an all-important context of brutalisation -- that
anchors completely failed to note -- which explains why even a single person
would find any cause to celebrate yesterday's terrible carnage:

For the last year now, Palestinian civilians have been living through a
nightmare in which Israeli occupation forces have been nightly shelling
their towns using tanks, helicopters, and other heavy weapons. Palestinians
do not need a subscription to Jane's Defence Weekly to learn the origin of
these weapons when they can pick up shell casings from the floors of their
homes and from their backyards with MADE IN THE U.S.A. stamped on them.
United States weaponry supplied to Israel includes:
Heavy weapons:

F-16 fighter planes, Apache and Cobra attack helicopters, and Reshef patrol
boats to attack Palestinian buildings and vehicles; and

Armoured pile drivers and armoured bulldozers to destroy Palestinian homes
and agricultural land.


Heavy ammunition:

Naval and tank artillery including 76mm, 105mm and 120mm high explosive
rounds;
M114 TOW rockets and Hell-Fire air-to-ground missiles;
Shoulder-fired, anti-armour Light Anti-tank Weapons (LAW) rocket launchers
firing 84mm or 90mm rockets;
M203 and MK19 grenade launchers;
40-90 mm mortars; and

A modified version of the M494 105mm, an anti-personnel cluster bomb.


Smaller ammunition:

5.56 mm bullets for M-16 machine guns;
7.62 mm high velocity bullets for general purpose machine guns and Galil
sniper rifles;
12.7 mm bullets for Browning machine guns and Barret sniper rifles; and
The "less lethal" rubber-coated and plastic-coated metal bullets.
The U.S. weaponry listed above has not been used proportionally for the
purpose of defending Israel -- as one would hope any military aid is used --
but rather has been used disproportionally and offensively to kill over 600
Palestinians, one-third of whom are children, 60 percent of whom were killed
outside of clash situations. The U.S. weaponry listed above has additionally
been used to seriously injure another 15,000 Palestinians, 1,500 of whom
have been crippled for life. That Israel has used "excessive force" to
suppress the current Palestinian uprising against 34 years of its military
occupation is a fact according to the United Nations Security Council, other
UN bodies, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Israeli human rights
organisation B'Tselem, and the US State Department. However offensive the
images of the small groups of Palestinians that were celebrating may be, the
fact is that all those depicted in the images -- if they are under 34 years
of age -- have known nothing but military occupation for the entirity of
their lives. That celebration was the reaction of only a tiny minority of
people in such a situation is a testimony to the Palestinians' maintainance
of human values in a situation devoid of them.


Not only does the United States sell weapons and ammunition to Israel, but
many of these weapons are supplied as U.S. aid to Israel. A current figure
for U.S. aid currently given to Israel is $3 billion per year, which
includes $1.2 billion in economic aid and $1.8 billion in military aid. It
is difficult to offer this as a conclusive figure since additional money is
given to Israel that is buried in the budgets of individual government
agencies such as the Defense Department. Every Palestinian is aware that the
U.S. supplies the weapons that Israel uses against them. That celebration
was the reaction of only a tiny minority of people in such a situation is a
testimony to the Palestinians' maintainance of human values in a situation
devoid of them.


Every Palestinian is also aware that their television screens are never
filled with images of Americans protesting the use of their tax dollars to
pay for the missiles that shake their cities and create similarly
distressing scenes of injured and shocked civilians, as seen yesterday in
New York. That celebration was the reaction of only a tiny minority of
people in such a situation is a testimony to the Palestinians' maintainance
of human values in a situation devoid of them.
The U.S. media broadcast the footage yesterday without explaining any of the
above, something that is neither new nor -- any longer -- acceptable in
light of the anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab and the anti-Muslim sentiment it
creates. No organisation of journalists who seek to bring their viewers an
accurate representation of reality should be broadcasting contextless,
unrepresentative images that encourage racism against nationalities and
their associated ethnic groups.

In the first few days following the 1995 attack on the Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma, Arabs and Muslims in the U.S. reported more than 200
incidents of harassment, threats and actual violence. According to reports
received by The Electronic Intifada and a press release yesterday from the
Council on American-Islamic Relations there have already been reports of
harassment and attacks against Arabs and Muslims in the United States. Hate
mail and threats have also been directed at The Electronic Intifada and
other Palestinian, Arab and Muslim websites.

As those of us who live in the U.S. are currently feeling justifiable anger
at the perpetrators behind yesterday's shocking and horrifying events in New
York and Washington DC, let us not misdirect it at an entire people who
continue to suffer through one of the darkest periods of their already bleak
history. The Palestinian people, who sit glued to their television sets in
disturbed silence like the rest of the world, are actually better placed
than most to understand what those of us living in America currently feel
and are finding it hard to express.

This whole thing is like as they say "life being stranger than fiction" I
dont think anyone even here in NZ (yesterday) at the K Road Markets Auckland
there everything seemed depressed and seemed to be a down beat: there were
far fewer taxis or people partying. I said some crazy things and a mate of
mine "attacked" me by grabbing me around the throat (if he'd killed me then
so be it I feel pretty knackered these days!): he "concluded" that I had
been traumatised as he said...he may have been right as I still dont believe
(or apart of my mind doesnt believe) that it happened.... but I think most
people even an Afghani (recently from there) couldnt understand why this
"attack" could (in a terrible way) have a "good" side....even here people
are traumatised.
  In 1963 I had a vision of Kennedy being shot a few days before but I think
the big thing was for little old Noo Zeelan' inthose days was the US - Cuba
standoff and the threat of a Nuclear war. I remember reading "On the Beach"
by Neville Shute. Eliot's poem and Yeat's "A terrible beauty is born" come
to mind. I was reading in the paper that cell phones (advanced technology)
helped people to reassure each other. Also the BBC kind of "brushed past"
the fact that (just after I'd watched it) people were NOT unanimous in
wanting a war...there is debate going on..but they were obviously wanting to
hear what was next said by a reporter: "100% of Americans want a war"
translate that to intelligent people in the world want to find out why
people have various political and religious views.and why some are
disgruntled and others extremely hate (maybe enviously maybe for crazy
religious reasons) the US and others capitalism (which its like hating any
other "ism" - an abstraction - is problematic)...I think that after everyone
has taken stock as much unbiased information (as objective and many sided as
it is possible to be) be made available to people in the West about what is
going on in the Middle East (not the superficial crap we are fed all the
time - in depth stuff): conversely there are people in eg Afghanistan who
dont even know what the World Trade Towers are: huge areas of the World are
if opposed to oppression etc by the Isreaelis (who always seem to have big
US backing if many arent commuters from the US and back) who've been
blitzing the Palestinians and anyone else who disagrees with them since
before I was born (1948).
   I'm well aware that the guys who did this are "bad bastards" dont get me
wrong: but how to "selectively" get them?  How is a massive War by the US
(when no one has actually declared war, no nation) going to do any good.

I have my differences with capitalism but I live and benefit from that
system and am grateful eg to the US's beating the Japanese - who were (I
mean the military) scum fascists - and too any young Americans had to die
for that: NZ gained we lost far less people (we could have been overrun as
Australia eg was being attacked). But I dont like to see human beings
destroyed in this way.
  It's good that people are thinking of people now: that's the good thing at
the moment: not the crazy politicos mouthing rhetoric.
  The greatness of the US and the West is its culture its artists and poets
its music its general freedom of speech its concepts: the East also has
much we can learn from as well as there are poeple in the West and the East
who are "backward"....
  Maybe those kamikaze pilots were "insane" but the result is a maybe
Communist or antio-capitlast's revolutionary's dream who would be secretly
excited that Bush and Powell are mobilising. Of course if Bin Laden is
behind it becaus he had a "vision" then he will be very happy because he
(and some of the extreme right in the West) have their lovely War.The
extremests of whatever ilk want destabilisation. Which ironically is what
the CIA are always stirring up!
  So expect civil liberties to be shut down as the US enters another
McCarthy era, another time like the times of the Vietnam War: paranoia may
well rule if a war gets going.  The war of course will aid the capitalists
to dump the huge amounts of overproduced goods and keep enpough people just
poor enough to JUST be struggling to get those new gadgets that they were
probably designing in the Towers.
  Of course I dont support extreme Muslims: but the problem is "who are
they"? Where are they? Are they your next door neighbour? The kindly old
grocer down the road who actually has blue eyes and goes to a Jewish Church
(his cover is that he is a German Jew - but he's actually a crazy communist
with pro Iraqi sentiments) ....Is the whole thing an Saudi
Arabian-Jewish-Israeli- British-Neo Nazi-CIA-Bin Laden plot? Or was it a
finite number of nut cakes? When the tanks roll into Afghanistan most of the
people there(who probably havent radio or cell phones or fridges or TV and
dont give a damn about democracy (they are struggling to earn$20.00 a
month)) just see another invasion...the US will look like th Soviets  1979.
Maybe the US will "win" but like all wars the winners are the losers.
    Better to help these countries raise their standards of education and
living etc?   To be fair I think that under Clinton a lot of progress was
neing made toward a compromise in the Israel-Palestine situation. That's
what they need to compromise and "you take this"  "we'll have that " ad then
somehow "share" the holy land and Jerusalem...then I think as the
Palestinians get a higher standard of living and opportunities many would
help the US versus Bin laden (if he and his ilk are the core of the problem)
but the extremists would "lighten up or die out....
  But as to New York I visited there and I also feel from that personal;
point of view that a great city has been violated: I have a map of NY, I
read books about the sky scrapers that fascinate me, I loved being there, I
found the average New Yorker more friendly (it semed) or at leaast they were
very polite people...MYrkers may be surprised but I found that the place
seemed safer than NZ and the pubs and public toilets etc were in a better
state than here in Auckland (where there is a lot of violence on the
streets)...and the Guggenheim and the great sense of a great city. But there
were problems. It's a cliche: but its a troubled world. And these are
terrible times for people whose loved ones have been killed or maimed or
injured in NY or elsewhere.... Richard.

*****************************

Sept 13, 2001

Dear Charles-- I read your two messages on the Buffalo poetics list-serve.

Just to get another articulate first hand account from someone whose voice I
recognized was wonderfully calming. Many, many thanks.

Things are . . . more or less fine down here in Philadelphia. To say that
people are shaken is, of course, an understatement. I left New York at seven
on Monday night, and the bus, after a very slow exit from the city, skimmed
along the upper Jersey shore at Weehawkin, while I gazed across the river at
the twin towers and the rest of the Manhattan skyline and thought about how
passively beautiful it was . . . Then next morning, when I was walking down
the impersonal pale-yellow ninth floor corridor of Anderson Hall (site of
the Temple English Department) to my office, 955, I heard pudgy gray-bearded
Dan O'Hare saying to another professor, "... crashed a 747 into the World
Trade Center . . ." and I thought: Of course, this is a joke or a
description of a film--and laughed.

But, with that odd grin with which, today, we recount the unbelievable, Dan
turned to me: "No, I mean it. Ten minutes ago--it was on the news!"

I exclaimed, "What . . .!" with, I'm afraid, the same mindless grin.

Moments later, in her sandals and earth-colored shift, tall, make-up-less,
Elayne Tobin stepped out of her office.

I turned to her. "Did you hear--someone just crashed a 747--" that's what,
by then, we had been told--"into the World Trade Center!"

"What?" she said. "Oh, you're kidding me--" She pulled back.

"No I'm not," I said. "This is for real."

At which point, Dan, who, apparently, as he stood in the doorway, was
getting the report we could not hear from a radio inside, said: "Two  of
them! One into each tower. One tower's completely gone. The other's on
fire!"

"Oh, my God!" Elayne said. "No. No, I can't process this!" She turned, and
started quickly down the hall--and thus began a day of confusion, fear, and
upset, here at the University.

Yes, I've lost the transition material. But only seconds later, I remember
little Jena Osman looking up and saying to me, "This is unbelievable! I
mean, this is unbelievable . . .!" Then, I turned into Graham and Bruce's
office (the two graduate students whose door is directly across the alcove
from mine), where Howard Stern and Robin Quivers were coming over the little
cubic, silver-plastic radio at the back of Bruce's desk, and over about
three minutes I heard them go from joking to realizing this was for real.
"Mow 'em all down, wipe 'em out," was one of the phrases that I recall from
Stern's jeremiad.

By the time my ten o'clock class met, we'd had the reports from the Pentagon
added to it all. While we were sitting there, discussing it all, Alexander
(the tall, good looking black kid who sits toward the back of the class)
Belton's cell-phone rang. He took it out, and in a moment we got another
up-date. Seconds after the class was over, and I got back through the
cinderblocked stair well, from the Annex into Alexander Hall, and turned
into a large room where someone had a TV (not on cable: the picture was
black and white and snowy), where I watched the smoke pouring out of the
pentagon, and then saw--for what, over the last three days, now seems the
first of hundreds of times--the two towers, one, then the other, smoking,
imploding, collapsing.

It was World Peace Day--

Only months ago America and Israel--arrogantly; for however much one
disapproves of how things are being carried out, it would seem that there is
still some onus on the participants to sit it out and keep articulating
their objections (even if, or especially if, it seems to be just an
Israel-bashing session, though even their own objections to the
characterization of "Zionism" as an inherently racist philosophy don't seem
to make into that)--walked out on the Racism Conference in South Africa--

How long ago did our government decide not to "publicize" the murder of two
million people in Rwanda, for fear someone might want us to get involved--

I love America passionately. What an odd and simple thing to say. Yet
something such as this makes me incredibly aware of it. It's a beautiful and
wonderful country in so many, historically fabulous ways--ways that it would
take fables to make comprehensible to Tocqueville and Proudhon and even
Marx. Its people *and* its government are extraordinary in endless
documentable ways. There is no justification for the horror that this
is--not represents, but is. Still, the one thing I am sure of, is that while
the media keeps naming this a "cowardly attack," those who did it--however
misinformed they might be--thought of it as a "brave defense" against the
forces of Imperialism. Until our government understands that, there will be
no possibility of peace, because both sides can only speak past one another
in a field of such misunderstanding.

To date there is no general traffic to and from Manhattan.

I've got my hypertension medicine for the next several weeks.

I now know, of course, that it was a 767 and a 757 (not two 747s) that
crashed into the towers: I have the whole CNN chronology, from 8:45am till
2:00 pm, cut out and pasted in my journal.

Stories keep coming in, such as from my friend John Castro, in Brooklyn, who
heard about the first strike, ran up on the roof, and Saw-disbelieving--the
second plane fly into second tower. ". . . There was all this smoke. And for
little while, you couldn't see anything--then, the smoke blew away. And one
of the towers was gone . . .!"

The morning of the 11th, perhaps six or seven hours before the towers were
struck, Vince Czyz (who read for us last year at the Wednesday's at Four
program) wrote me the following e-mail:

"Yesterday walking out of the gym where I work out a mere twice a week (20
minutes on that stationary bike rounds out the workout), I was feeling quite
good, it was about 5 pm, sunny, warm not hot. Just as I stepped out of the
gym, there was a sort of muffled thunder and the sort of concussion that
makes your chest hum some. I thought, "Oh, those Turks. Fireworks again."
Here, there are firework displays if there is a marriage, if a team wins, if
someone looses his virginity . . . all right, I exaggerate, but they're
common here. I thought nothing more of it.

"Coming out of my apartment in Taksim about 15 minutes later, I saw cop cars
rushing about, ambulances peeling down the raot, lights flashing, sirens
wailing and I saw ordinary motorists doing about 150 mph in Taksim Square
with hazard lights on and horns blowing. I saw a crowd of people gathered in
the Square and I wondered what was going on. But as I was late for a private
lesson and my students are paying me about $25 an hour, I hurried into the
metro.

"The thunder turned out to be a bomb, which killed the woman carrying it and
two policemen. It happened a few hundred meters from where I was but I was
more than shielded by all the buildings in between.

"It is, as far as I know, the first lethal bomb blast in Taksim, the center
of Istanbul, in about nine years-and very close to the site of that one. We
did have one in Sisli, a mile or so from Taksim, about a year ago, and
although cops were targeted, only the bomber was killed."

Vince's message goes on to mention the names of possible groups
responsible-names that, fifteen hours later, would be relatively familiar to
all of us, if they weren't already: " . . . the Turkish Hezbollah. Possibly
the Kurdish Worker's Party? Unlike the Middle East, it's often the case that
no one claims responsibility. I think the military's gonna reprise anyway."

And a day later, my friend Robert Morales phones to tell me ... that the
streets are deserted: "Times Square at four in the afternoon looked more
like what it usually does at one AM on Monday morning-and pretty much every
movie house in the city is packed, with all but no seating in no matter what
the film. Apparently there's nothing to do but watch TV or go to the movies
. . ."

Tom Besio, estranged husband of the artist Who drew *Bread & Wine*, and who
works out of  his and his wife's loft on Church Street as an acupuncturist,
was out on the balcony doing exercises, when he heard the first plane swoop
by, looked up, and saw it strike. He and a dozen others, coming out on the
grilled fire escapes that front that swing-out picture windows, stared at
the smoking tower until the second plane struck. At that point, apparently,
everyone watching realized it was *not* an accident and turned and fled the
building, the neighborhood . . . !

On the 11th, phone calling in and out of the city was, of course, almost
impossible. I know this (in my case) from twenty-five, thirty-five calls
with all lines busy. Once when I was out of the office, Dennis managed to
get a call through to me and leave a message on my machine. Did I cuss
*my*-self out for going to the bathroom just then . . .? Finally, around
four-thirty, I got two calls through.

Dennis tells me my sister is all right, though the city is basically under
marshal law.

Second day information: Well, we live on a block (in Manhattan) with a
police precinct at the other end, and so are cordoned off with yellow tape.
Phalanxes of officers roam around. Anyone who lives on the block has to show
name-and-address ID to get back into our building, so Dennis and John Del
Gaizo both report.

This morning at breakfast, here in Philadelphia, at a little place called
Logan's about two blocks from where I live on Spruce Street, I listened to a
local policemen tell a tall thin, and a small butterball of a, waitress that
a bizarre burglar is loose in the neighborhood. (Is it connected to the
general confusion or not? No one knows.) Since yesterday morning, he has
committed over ten burglaries in a three block area. At the last place he
robbed--since no one was home--he stayed long enough to take a shower before
he left. Indeed, in Philadelphia the visible police force on the street has
doubled overnight, and there is much talk of possible looting and similar
unrest even here--though the city is sunny and leaves chatter over the
red-brick streets of Center City.

I'm supposed to be in the city this weekend (to have dinner with a scholar
visiting from Germany), but I wonder whether things will be back to normal
enough for me to return. My very intelligent daughter tells me that I should
get Dennis down here, rather than going back to him. But, the truth is, I
feel as if I have abandoned my city, my home--and that I have some sort of
duty to be there, indeed, if just as a witness.

Wednesday night, I went to a bar on South Street where I often have
dinner--Manny Brown's. Four of the six televisions that they have in the
back, where I eat, were replaying the disaster. Robert M. had pointed out
that there are dozens, if not hundreds of video tapes of the incidents,
beginning to end, from practically every conceivable angle. At this point, I
feel like I have seen them all, several times through. Only as I was leaving
Brown's to go home through the neo-punk piercings and tatooings of South
Street, did it strike me: The media was, whether on purpose or not, trying
to make it seem as if there had been dozens on dozens of attacks. The effect
was kind of like the fantasia of atom bombs going off to the melody and
lyrics of "We'll Meet Again . . ." at the end of *Dr. Strangelove.*

Back at my Spruce Street apartment, last night at three in the morning, I
woke with a strangely persistent memory of the first time--twenty-odd years
ago--I had flown back to New York and the plane had crossed over lower
Manhattan, en route to LaGuardia. I'd looked down out the oval plastic
window to see that great steel-and-glass tuning-fork, sticking up above all
the surrounding buildings and thought: "My God, remember when, in the
thirties, that plane rammed the Empire State building? Those would be so
*easy* to hit! Some suicidal, psychotic pilot . . . Some crazed terrorist .
. ." The thought was so appalling I'd shoved it down, as one does, but last
night it emerged and lay there for me to look at--and breathe deeply over.
It made me wonder how many other people had thought the same thing in
twenty-odd years.

The other thought that came to me, so strongly, to make me choke and blink:
(I may go back on it, but right now I doubt it):

If we kill *single* Arab civilian in retaliation for this, then--given what
was just done to us, and after having experienced and watched and listened
to its effects on all the radically innocent men and women whose lives have
been shattered, so many of them forever--we will have started the horrible,
horrible process that could, in some out-of-touch minds, come close to
justifying what was done. (Because it says, yes, when you have been enraged
and made to suffer, striking out and killing innocent people is all right.
And isn't that the essence of terrorism, no matter who does it?) And we
mustn't do that.

This is rushed-and, indeed, is a version of a letter I'm sending to a number
of people. (Should you feel like forwarding it, please do.) But for all
that, I send my most personal and specific

Love to you, B., and the kids,

No doubt there's plenty of brutality to go around.  Here's another story.  It
comes from Sergio Leone's "A Fistful of Dollars."  James Coburn, an Irish
revolutionary, tells Rod Steiger, a Mexican peasant turned bandit, that the
landlords, politicians, bankers are the problem.  Rod Steiger replies, "I
know all about revolutions.  The people who read books tell the people who
don't read books, the poor people, that they are exploited, that they must
make a change.  So the people who don't read books load their weapons and
make the change.  Afterwards the people who read books sit at a fancy table
and eat well and celebrate.  Where are the people who don't read books, the
poor people?  They aren't at the table.  They're dead."

Hmmm . . .

Best, Bill

Charles, much thanks for this.  Samuel's contained celebration of things
American were a welcome relief.  I do, however, think it obvious our
government is well aware that those responsible think of themselves as
patriots striking against Imperialism, the great Satan, sacrificing their
lives, all in the name of god.  But I don't think such understanding changes
anything.  Our government does not agree with their point of view.  Most
Americans do not agree with their point of view.  Most Americans do not
consider the west singularly oppressive.  Most Americans do not agree with
one another on any number of issues.  That freedom to disagree is a matter of
pride for us, and it seems likely we'll do some damage of our own to protect
it.  Sigh and sigh.  Best, Bill

My friends Ryan Knighton and Louis cabri are both poets with RP, and

               15 September 2001
Just a quick note from this side of the globe. I'm teaching at an
American-affiliated, mixed-gender college in Muscat, Oman. The mostly-Arab
students and international faculty have been nothing but sympathetic,
expressing profound sorrow to me and all Americans concerning the recent
events. ("Please, sir, accept our condolences for what has happened in your
country. It is a terrible tragedy.") Every taxi I step into, the driver also
expresses his condolences. The other evening while out smoking a sheesha,
the busboy told me that "in jihad it is forbidden to kill innocent people"
and that "only sadists" could do such a thing. The maitre'd came to my
table, also, to tell me how profoundly sorry he was for "what has happened
in [my] country." My students, colleagues, and other Arabs and Muslims I
encounter daily have condemned these acts. Islam, I am told, is a religion
of mercy, compassion and peace, and I have hardly been treated otherwise
here in the Middle East. (On the other hand, Christianity is a religion of
love and forgiveness, right?) Many people have written to me concerning my
safety here. As long as the US, UK, IDF or Taliban aren't personally
targeting you, life is extremely peaceful on the peninsula. An American in
Arabia is safer than an Arab in America.
     The Israeli military have used this tragedy as cover to launch attacks
on Palestine, exploiting a percieved lack of Western sympathy. They have
broken off planned truce talks. Arafat and the Palestinian Authority, while
vehemently condemning the attacks in the US, are experiencing fresh
invasions of their territory. Maybe you all have read, heard or seen this,
maybe not; I don't know what American television is projecting. This year I
turned down a position at the Arab American University, Jenin, West Bank. (I
took the much higher paying one in Muscat; it must be my age creeping up.)
This is the city attacked by F-15 fighter jets last spring; this is the city
invaded by tanks behind the smoke of the WTC; and now Gaza. So it goes.
     Last year I taught in the United Arab Emirates. It's being said that a
couple suspects possessed UAE passports, and that the UAE is a closet
Taliban supporter. Perhaps there is fresher news, I don't know. The
transportation hub of the Middle East, the UAE is a rather porous country,
natives outnumbered 5 to 1 by expats, mostly from southwest Asia, while
English-speaking Westerners run the universities. It's like the USA or EU of
the Middle East with people always trying to get in to work and send money
home to their families.
     I just felt the need to state that here in the Arab world, in Muscat at
least, the men and women I meet have been expressing to me their compassion
for the people of the United States...and hoping that Bush Jr. doesn't just
start shooting missiles willy-nilly out this way. They are all concerned
about random collective punishment. They want the actual perpetrators
identified.

I just read through some of the past days' digests of emails on this
listserv and was moved/interested to read other people's stories of the last
five days...thanks to all of you for that and for the poems.

I wanted to mention a few things which may be helpful, and sorry if some of
it is obvious stuff:

If any of you here in NYC want to volunteer to help the rescue workers,
almost all the hospitals/big relief centers are now overloaded and
over-full, but there are some smaller community-based centers and shelters
around town (or at least downtown Manhattan) accepting volunteers to help
the rescue workers get dry clothes/food/sleep/supplies of all kinds. I was
doing this all day and it is both a good way to help out in some vague way
and to make some direct contact with what's going on in our city/to our
neighbors etc. etc. Very, very moving. I saw a fireman with his mother's
name and phone number written on his arm in case anything happens to him. I
also met a very shy man who works spraying pesticide on roses in Delaware
who drove here today to give us his respiratory masks.

If you want to donate stuff, the workers need (at least now, this changes
fairly often) serious respiratory masks and filters, goggles, elbow-length
electrical gloves, big thick boots, batteries, hard hats and the like;
quasi-medical stuff including sunblock, sun burn solutions like solarcaine,
and "eye lubricant" (not, apparently, to be confused with saline solution).
Also, there is a  big demand for cigarettes which the community relief
centers are sending down but big ones such as Red Cross won't.

The relief center in the West Village is PS 41, on 11th between 6th and 7th
(until midnight tomorrow as school starts again on Monday). There is another
one at Union Square. These centers are mobile, though, depending on
work/school schedules so you can check a local radio station or ask nearby
hospitals etc.

Also, there is some good peace/activist political activity happening
downtown -- organizing responses/vigils/actions etc. You can find these
groups at Vigils or at the Union Square memorial.

I'm also wondering about good sources of political analysis and information
on-line. I like Alexander Cockburn's www.counterpunch.com, and also
antiwar.com, and www.indymedia.org, Maybe people can recommend some other
good ones -- ? Does anyone know an environmental site that talks about
what's really in the air down here? In general, though, I really think that
this is a good time to, as Jello Biafra says, not resent the big media for
its misinformation but "become the media." I think that's what this listserv
is already doing.

Finally, friends of mine with some medical savvy say that two good things to
do now to help with the toxins in the air are: boil sage or eucalyptus and
breathe the steam with your head over the pot and a towel over your head --
this clears the respiratory system. Put an organic lemon in the blender with
a little water and some honey and drink it down -- this helps your body to
de-tox.

That's it for now. Call or backchannel if I can give any info. on the above.
Stay safe all over, Caroline Crumpacker

Hey all,

Here's a *very toned down* letter I've been sending to members of Congress,
et al.  Thought you might be interested.

Trane






Open Letter:

        It seems there is a quickness to cry "war" in response to the
horrifying attacks of September eleventh.  While it is clearly incredibly
urgent that the international community find the perpetrators of these
heinous crimes and bring them to justice, an overhasty/unilateral military
response is an entirely wrongheaded tack to take.  President Bush has
mentioned "retribution," several members of Congress have described the
attack as "an act of war," and the attack has repeatedly been compared to
the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Worst of all, this attack has repeatedly been
presented as a struggle between "good and evil."  The problem with all of
these characterizations is that they serve to disguise the nature of these
attacks while offering "solutions" that are irrational and, indeed,
decidedly dangerous.  Let's look at these points one by one:

1)  The notion of "retribution" or "revenge" is an atavistic notion at
best, and a ten-cent publicity stunt at worst.  This notion, the idea that
an eye for an eye somehow produces any real kind of peace, bypasses the
real purpose of defense -- the safety of civilian populations.  By engaging
in a campaign of "revenge," rather than attempting to examine and mitagate
the root causes of these attacks, we can only end up by further endangering
U.S. citizens.  The logic of revenge and retribution is the logic of
terror, the same logic used by the terrorists who flew into the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon.  Rather than engage in a campaign of retributive
justice, we need to engage in a campaign of restorative justic.  Unlike
retributive justice, which seeks to engage a past offense via revenge,
restorative justice is a way to look toward the future and attempt to use
the arms of government and law to build a genuine peace.  We need to look
beyond the simple-headed notion that punishment produces peace and instead
register the fact that peace (and security) is as much, if not more, the
product of well-considered and genuinly respectful international relations.
As a nation we have got to leave the paradigm of retribution behind.  Our
unilateral military operations do not produce internal security -- instead,
they produce a mirror-image of rage that, as we have seen, can come back to
haunt us later.  Military solutions should always be the very last -- never
the very first -- solution.  Finally, the logic of "retribution" seems all
too often to involve a kind of excuse for the death of innocents.  Our own
national tragedy must not become an excuse to justify the taking of
innocent lives in any other nation -- to buy into this way of thinking is
to engage in the very ideology of terror.

2)  The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon should in no way
be seen as an "act of war" or likened to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The
attack on Pearl Harbor was a nationally orchestrated attack by the
government of Japan.  An "act of war" is a conscious act of one government
toward another.  In the case of the recent attacks it seems incredibly
unlikely that any national government can be held directly responsible.  To
attack a nation simply because of a loose chain of association (with an
individual or organization) is to fire wildly at the wrong target.
Terrorist organizations are not governments or nations and attacking any
government or nation in the name of the fight against terrorism will not
serve to reduce the threat of attack against our nation.  Indeed, involving
another nation militarily for an act committed outside of the direct
involvement of its governing body will only intensify anti-U.S. sentiment.
Instead of one enemy, we will have multiple enemies.  Worst of all,
however, an attack directed against another nation for the actions of a few
individuals associated with that nation will result in an incredible loss
of innocent life.  If  we are to continue to claim to be the "leaders of
the free world" we must not engage in unseemly tactics of retrogressive
violence against others.  Our leadership must be an unhypocritical
leadership -- a leadership by example and a leadership that is clearly
based on the priority of human life and human rights, no matter where.

3)  The language of "good and evil" dangerously elides any rational
analysis of events by placing them within a moral/religious framework that
does not take into account history, causation, point of view, cultural
context, the nature of world-wide social formations, etc.  By thinking in
terms of good and evil we can only restrict the range of our understanding
in ways that will certainly lead to further harm.  Unless we work to
understand the reasons for the attacks against us, including the mindset of
those who were involved, we cannot begin the difficult task of working
against that mindset using tools that will not lead to the proliferation of
violence.  The too easy separation of the world into black and white, the
dissapearance of nuance and distinction, is precisely the kind of thinking
that allows for indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians.

        If we are to escape from the sinister circle of mutual retribution
we must rethink the way in which we go about pursuing justice.  Our justice
should not be the justice of military rage, but the justice of reasoned
argument and restraint.  Until we realize that retribution does not solve
problems we will be doomed to play an infinite game of idiot's chess in
which all the pieces are killed off, one by one, until only the two kings
remain to meaninglessly circle the board forever.  We must not let our
national mourning become an irrational anger or a call for unjustified war.
It is time to begin the more difficult path toward real solutions,
solutions that will work toward the peaceful end of conflict rather than a
continuation of violent reaction.

        Finally, it is of the utmost importance that we do not allow this
violent act against the United States to produce internal violence against
members of our own community -- especially Arab-Americans and
Muslim-Americans.  President Bush and all members of the U.S. Congress need
to be very clear about this.  To remain silent during the rising tide of
anti-Arab and anti-Muslim sentiment is to tacitly endorse it.  We are not a
nation of bigots and we must insist on this fact repeatedly by the shape of
our actions.  Now is a time for strength, and strength bears no resemblance
to anger.

Sincerely,
Trane DeVore,
Oakland, California

Charles,

Like most of us my first reaction to the tragic events that have unfolded
over the past few days was one of shock & disbelief, then sadness for those
who were its unwitting victims, & then naturally to more sober refection &
appraisal of why & how such events occurred & then what can NOW be done to
stem the tidal wave and its ominous specter which looms with increasing
proportions over the world.

The sad truth is that most Americans, even those who are the so called well
educated, are naively unaware of popular sentiment around the world, & thus
unable to fathom the depth of resentment for America (its political &
economic ambitions), especially among third world peoples, who view America
as a presumptuous and arrogant bully who, parading in sheep's clothing,
proclaims that his intentions and actions are motivated purely by his love &
compassion for all peoples of the world. Even the less educated in these
countries are well aware of how America treats its own (black, Hispanic,
etc) economically deprived minorities. It seems that only Americans fall for
this crap, for the rest of the world it's at best a travesty, something to
be scorned and ridiculed. For an embittered few, who feel beaten and bound
and without hope, it leads to violence.

Let me fill you in at least on what writers & academics here in Taiwan are
saying about what has occurred. The following comments about recent events
appeared on the internet during the past few days. The two comments below
seemed most articulate, and give a fair sense of how many intellectuals here
view what has occurred. Please feel free to pass this on.

All best blessings in this time of unrest,

"For those who are strong and powerful it's very difficult to clearly
reflect on oneself. This is a tragic human weakness. America is hardly able
to recollect it own recent history. How the CIA in the 1950's tried to
overthrow the Iranian  government. This benefited of American oil companies
giving them a controlling interest in that country's oil. In 1983 they
entered Rwanda. In 1984 they entered Nicaragua for the third time. In 1986
Libya. In 1989 they attacked Panama for the fourth time since the turn of
the century. These attacks were all in direct violation of international law
and under the noble guise of justice, such as the war on drugs, or the
containment of Communism etc. America is in the habit of totally
disregarding other peoples' point of view, political beliefs, and national
aspirations.  This arrogance is the natural result of their unbridled power.

America sorely needs to learn something from the recent turn of events,
especially a bit of humility, and not to place their values above that of
others. Most importantly, if America does not reevaluate its role in the
world, then a tragic conflict between different cultures is unavoidable.
This is to say, that yes, America can and probably will succeed in taking
its revenge, but from now on they must also be forever on alert during the
endless wars, holy and unholy, that they will have spawned."


                                 * * *


"Fundamentally, getting rid of 'Bin Laden' and getting rid of 'the causes
that create Bin Ladens,' are entirely different matters. The later comes
from a virulent hatred of America. Whenever a conflict arises between the
Christian and Islamic worlds, America always sides with the Christian, not
simply because of religious beliefs, but because usually there's a better
fit with America's capitalistic ambitions. When such conflicts arise,
America either permits them, or supports them, or acts unilaterally to
punish the Islamic country. If the present world situation is not changed
--with capitalism controlling world events, and American as its leading
exponent--then even if you get rid of Bin Laden and his network of
terrorists, still you will not be able to get rid of the countless
generations of people who have animosity towards America.

Practically speaking, if America were to utterly annihilate Afghanistan in
order to get Bin Laden, that would still not resolve the problem because
Afghanistan is not the center of Islamic Fundamentalism. On the contrary, it
would probably alienate other Islamic factions who America might have
counted on for help. Or even if America tries, as it often has, to persuade
some Islamic faction to support it in its attempt to oust the
fundamentalists, these factions, as has been the case in the past, are
usually corrupt & unable to run government. This ultimately creates even
more dissatisfaction and unrest and people in these countries place the
blame on America's intervention in their politics. So from whatever angle
you look at it, America is always creating more enemies.

If America does not use this opportunity to reflect on the root of the
problem and change their narrow-minded and one sided view of events, then it
will be in for a war that could last for as long as eight or ten years. This
surely would be a war worse then Vietnam which was contained to that
country. Now America is embarking on a war that could take place anywhere on
its own soil."

Dear everyone, thank you so much for sending your
descriptions and thoughts about what is happening to
this list.  I am depending on this list for
information. In Mysore everyone is watching their
televisions.   Most people are very concerned about
what is happening in America, sad about the deaths and
glued to BBC.  I understand that some of the
professors in the universities say America deserved
this.   I'm warned occasionally to be careful in
Moslem areas but I do not feel any threat here.   In
Bangalore American students have received many
warnings to protect themselves.  I'm praying that
someone at the head of these greedy world corporations
will stop and not act solely to make money and please
ignorant people fueled by the media.

I'm including with this email a copy of an email I
received and I think it might be informative..
namaste, barbara

Dear friends

I was supposed to fly today on the 4:30 PM American
Airlines flight from LAX to JFK. But tonight I find
myself stuck in L.A. with an incredible range of
emotions over what has happened on the island where I
work and live in New York City.
My wife and I spent the first hours of the day --
after being awakened by phone calls from our parents
at 6:40am PT -- trying to contact our daughter at
school in New York and our friend JoAnn who works near
the World Trade Center.
I called JoAnn at her office. As someone picked up,
the first tower imploded, and the person answering the
phone screamed and ran out, leaving me no clue as to
whether or not she or JoAnn would live.
It was a sick, horrible, frightening day.

On December 27, 1985 I found myself caught in the
middle of a terrorist incident at the Vienna airport
-- which left 30 people dead, both there and at the
Rome airport. (The machine-gunning of passengers in
each city was timed to occur at the same moment.)

I do not feel like discussing that event tonight
because it still brings up too much despair and
confusion as to how and why I got to live. a fluke, a
mistake, a few feet on the tarmac, and I am still
here, there but for the grace of.
Safe. Secure. I'm an American, living in America. I
like my illusions. I walk through a metal detector, I
put my carry-ons through an x-ray machine,and I know
all will be well.

Here's a short list of my experiences lately with
airport security:

*At the Newark Airport, the plane is late at boarding
everyone. The counter can't find my seat. So I am told
to just "go ahead and get on" -- without a ticket!

&#61623; At Detroit Metro Airport, I don't want to put
the lunch I just bought at the deli through the x-ray
machine so, as I pass through the metal detector, I
hand the sack to the guard through the space between
the detector and the x-ray machine. I tell him "It's
just a sandwich." He believes me and doesn't bother to
check. The sack has gone through neither security
device.

* At LaGuardia in New York, I check a piece of
luggage, but decide to catch a later plane. The first
plane leaves without me, but with my bag -- no one
knowing what is in it.

* Back in Detroit, I take my time getting off the
commuter plane. By the time I have come down its
stairs, the bus that takes the passengers to the
terminal has left -- without me. I am alone on the
tarmac, free to wander wherever I want. So I do.
Eventually, I flag down a pick-up truck and an
airplane mechanic gives me a ride the rest of the way
to the terminal.

* I have brought knives, razors; and once, my
traveling companion brought a hammer and chisel. No
one stopped us.
Of course, I have gotten away with all of this because
the airlines consider my safety SO important, they pay
rent-a-cops $5.75 an hour to make sure the bad guys
don't get on my plane. That is what my life is
worth-less than the cost of an oil change.

Too harsh, you say? Well, chew on this: a first-year
pilot on American Eagle (the commuter arm of American
Airlines) receives around $15,000 a year in annual
pay.
That's right -- $15,000 for the person who has your
life in his hands. Until recently, Continental Express
paid a little over $13,000 a year. There was one guy,
an American Eagle pilot, who had four kids so he went
down to the welfare office and applied for food stamps
-- and he was eligible!

Someone on welfare is flying my plane? Is this for
real? Yes, it is.

So spare me the talk about all the precautions the
airlines and the FAA is taking. They, like all
businesses, are concerned about one thing – the bottom
line and the profit margin.

Four teams of 3-5 people were all able to penetrate
airport security on the same morning at 3 different
airports and pull off this heinous act? My only
response is -- that's all?

Well, the pundits are in full diarrhea mode, gushing
on about the "terrorist threat" and today's scariest
dude on planet earth -- Osama bin Laden. Hey, who
knows, maybe he did it. But, something just doesn't
add
up.

Am I being asked to believe that this guy who sleeps
in a tent in a desert has been training pilots to fly
our most modern, sophisticated jumbo jets with such
pinpoint accuracy that they are able to hit these
three targets without anyone wondering why these
planes were so far off path?

Or am I being asked to believe that there were four
religious/political fanatics who JUST HAPPENED to be
skilled airline pilots who JUST HAPPENED to want to
kill themselves today?

Maybe you can find one jumbo jet pilot willing to die
for the cause – but FOUR? Ok, maybe you can -- I don't
know.

What I do know is that all day long I have heard
verything about this bin Laden guy except this one
fact -- WE created the monster known as Osama bin
Laden!

Where did he go to terrorist school? At the CIA!

Don't take my word for it -- I saw a piece on MSNBC
last year that laid it all out. When the Soviet Union
occupied Afghanistan, the CIA trained him and his
buddies in how to commits acts of terrorism against
the Soviet forces. It worked! The Soviets turned and
ran. Bin Laden was grateful for what we taught him and
thought it might be fun to use those same techniques
against us.

We abhor terrorism -- unless we're the ones doing the
terrorizing.

We paid and trained and armed a group of terrorists in
Nicaragua in the 1980s who killed over 30,000
civilians. That was OUR work. You and me. Thirty
thousand murdered civilians and who the hell even
remembers!

We fund a lot of oppressive regimes that have killed a
lot of innocent people, and we never let the human
suffering THAT causes to interrupt our day one single
bit.

We have orphaned so many children, tens of thousands
around the world, with our taxpayer-funded terrorism
(in Chile, in Vietnam, in Gaza, in Salvador) that I
suppose we shouldn't be too surprised when those
orphans grow up and are a little whacked in the head
from the horror we have helped cause.

Yet, our recent domestic terrorism bombings have not
been conducted by a guy from the desert but rather by
our own citizens: a couple of ex-military guys who
hated the federal government.

From the first minutes of today's events, I never
heard that possibility suggested. Why is that?

Maybe it's because the A-rabs are much better foils. A
key ingredient in getting Americans whipped into a
frenzy against a new enemy is the all-important race
card. It's much easier to get us to hate when the

Object of our hatred doesn't look like us.

Congressmen and Senators spent the day calling for
more money for the military; one Senator on CNN even
said he didn't want to hear any more talk about more
money for education or health care -- we should have
only one priority: our self-defense.

Will we ever get to the point that we realize we will
be more secure when the rest of the world isn't living
in poverty so we can have nice running shoes?

In just 8 months, Bush gets the whole world back to
hating us again. He withdraws from the Kyoto
agreement, walks us out of the Durban conference on
racism, insists on restarting the arms race -- you
name it, and Baby Bush has blown it all.

The Senators and Congressmen tonight broke out in a
spontaneous version of "God Bless America." They're
not a bad group of singers!

Yes, God, please do bless us.

Many families have been devastated tonight. This just
is not right. They did not deserve to die. If someone
did this to get back at Bush, then they did so by
killing thousands of people who DID NOT VOTE for him!
Boston, New York, DC, and the planes' destination of
California -- these were places that voted AGAINST
Bush!
Why kill them? Why kill anyone? Such insanity.

Let's mourn, let's grieve, and when it's appropriate
let's examine our contribution to the unsafe world we
live in.
It doesn't have to be like this.

Yours,
Michael Moore

I sent this to talking point.

This has the appearance of a violent Hollywood film.
Indeed, a Schwarzenegger film did show a plane being
crashed into a building.

The United States has trained terrorists both directly
and indirectly. Indeed, they have been instrumental in
providing opportunities for training the Taliban and
supplying them with weapons. Their record in Central
and South America is also well know and their role in
Pakistan is also suspect.

Further, the Taliban are really stooges of some sort.
The real attraction in Afghanistan is the oil in
Central Asia. The US may now walk in and take over
under the pretext of democracy or whatever and gain
direct access, thus control over that oil.

The US is also the biggest seller of armaments. And
one of the large customers these days is terrorists.
If they are considered friendly they are called
freedom fighters or something such by the press. And
terrorists pay for their weapons mostly with drugs and
drug money. One can draw one’s own conclusions.

Further, militaries around the world do not attack
other armies. They attack civilians – exactly as has
been done in this case. Exactly as has been done in
Baghdad by weapons and sanctions. The civilians have
no weapons, they are relatively innocent and they are
not involved.

More specifically, some of the people who did this
thing were trained in the US. And how could airport
security be so lax that 4 planes from 3 different
airports could be highjacked? And how could American
intelligence fail to detect a plot of this magnitude?

Matin Stannard, our favorite Brit, has just published a whole bunch of
books, including Difficulties and Exultations (Smith/Doorstop Books)
ISBN 1-902382-29-3(!).  Which you should buy.


from Difficulties and Exultations

The Man Who Went Into the Sky

Sometimes the rope you try and hang
yourself with turns out to be
miles too long.  Night is heavier than an anvil.
You are not the billiant centre of everything.
All the roads you drive down remind you
of what you are losing.  Sometimes
the air here is too full of suffocation.

Sometimes you have to bite the bullet
and take off.  The air is too thick
to lead a satisfying life.  Crazy moves
don't convince a lot of people
you can be trusted, or you're a genius.
Sometimes what you believe in
turns out to be a bag of air with holes in.

Sometimes you have to be kicked out
of your life so the blindfold falls off
your eyes.  Faith demands a cdrtain degree
of effort and Easter doesn't always lead
to continued happiness.  Sometimes you wake up
when you are asleep and someone is shouting
at your head and they've always been shouting
but you didn't hear them because
you weren't listening.

Sometimes a miracle insists on its place
in this world.  A visit to the edge of the cliff
is all it takes.  The bears there
reminded you, turning visible
from invisible.  It was the move you had to make
though it was a move you didn't want to take
but you took it.  Sometimes the sky
is better to look at than the ground.

Sometimes the sky is the only place
left to go.  When the unthinkable happens
we are forced to think of who we are.
The clouds are thick but full of the only life
that's worth living.  Where the gods are is home,
but when the people here try to reel us in
we won't be there.  Sometimes knowing so much
is the same as knowing pure nothing.

 Middle-class suicide bombers
By Stephen Romei, New York correspondent
September 17, 2001
AS investigators begin to reconstruct the lives of the men who took over the
cockpits, one thing is certain: they were not your average suicide bombers.


 These were not impoverished youths, inspired by religious fanaticism and
promises of sexual ecstasy in a martyrs paradise, walking into a restaurant
with bombs around their waists.

They flew first class, paying up to $US4500 ($8700) for a one-way ticket to
death in the name of a war on the US. They purchased their tickets on the
internet. They quoted their frequent flyer numbers.

They were good citizens in suburban America, living quiet, law-abiding lives.
They drove sedans and, contrary to Muslim law, drank in bars. Some had
families.

All in all, a picture of middle-class comfort.

It is a profile that horrifies terrorism experts, who say the emergence of a
new breed of older, better-educated suicide bomber portends a culture-wide
rage against the West. "People who have a lot of other reasons to live for
are deciding this is such an important cause that they are willing to die
anyway," terrorism expert Andrea Talentino told The New York Times. "That,
obviously, is very frightening."

Ehud Sprinzak, head of an Israel-based think tank that has just published a
book on suicide bombers, said: "We'll have to rewrite it. This is staggering
new evidence."

Others are drawing comparisons between Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden, the
prime suspect in last week's kamikaze attacks in New York and Washington, and
Adolf Hitler.

Their thinking is that, like Hitler, bin Laden has crystallised national
feelings of anger and disaffection and turned them into a concentrated
hatred. That hate found extraordinary expression in the murderous actions of
ostensibly ordinary men last Tuesday. Even now, the worst neighbours can say
about the terrorists who lived next door was that they kept to themselves.

"They were very, very private people," said real estate agent Paul
Stimmeling, who helped three of the suspected hijackers find homes in Vero
Beach, Florida. "The children came out and played, but the adults stayed
behind closed doors."

They were not men of steel. Salem al-Hamzi, for example, was only 160cm tall
and rail-thin. He talked finding a Mexican bride and surfed the internet in
search of one.

It is a starkly different lifestyle to that of the typical suicide bomber,
according to Israel-based academic Ariel Merari, who is writing a book on the
subject.

He says their average age is 22 and very few are married. In heaven, they are
told, 70 black-eyed virgins await them. Back on Earth, their poor families
will be rewarded with cash.

The suicide bomber has become a devastating weapon of modern terrorism, with
researchers documenting 286 incidents between 1983 and 2000 in Lebanon,
Israel and Turkey alone.

"We have nothing with which to repel killing and thuggery against us except
the weapon of martyrdom," Palestinian Islamic Jihad secretary-general Ramadan
Shalah wrote in Foreign Policy magazine last year.

The FBI has identified 19 men as the suspected hijackers, seven of whom had
the expertise to pilot the passenger planes that speared into the World Trade
Centre and the Pentagon.

Following is a breakdown of that list by each of the four planes used in the
attacks (the fourth crashed in rural Pennsylvania after some passengers
attacked the terrorists):

American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon: Khalid
al-Mihdar, Majed Moqed, Nawaf al-Hamzi, Salem al-Hamzi and Hani Hanjor. Their
ages are not yet known.

American Airlines Flight 11, the first jet to hit the World Trade Centre:
Satam al-Suqami, 25, Waleed al-Sherir, 28, Mohammed Atta, 33, Abdulaziz
al-Omari, 22.

United Airlines Flight 175, the second jet into the World Trade Centre:
Marwan al-Shehhi, 23, Ahmed Faiez, Ahmed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi and
Mohaid al-Shehri, ages unknown.

United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania: Saeed al-Ghamdi,
25, Ahmed al-Haznawi, 21, Ziad Samir Jarrah, 26, Ahmed al-Nami, age unknown.

The ages of the men are based on identification documents such as their
driver's licences, which may not be genuine. Law enforcement sources said
some of the terrorists were in their 40s.

They lived in rental properties across the US, from Florida to New York to
California. Several attended aviation schools in Florida, paying thousands of
dollars in cash to hone their flying skills.

All of the hijackers purchased tickets marked August 25-28 for last Tuesday's
suicide mission.

Mohammed Atta, for example, used a Visa card to buy a first-class seat on
American Airlines Flight 11. He ordered the paperless ticket via the AA
website, accessing it with his frequent flyer number.

"He just seemed like a businessman . . . everything about him, his demeanour,
the way he looked," Brad Warrick, who rented Atta a car, told the Los Angeles
Times.

"He would wear nice slacks and a polo shirt. He was articulate and spoke
English very well. He just seemed like an everyday, local guy."

Faiez and al-Shehri paid $US4500 each for first-class seats on United
Airlines Flight 175. Both gave their address as a post box at a Mail Boxes
Etc store in Florida.

Al-Hamzi, who lived in San Diego, used online travel agency Travelocity to
book a seat on American Airlines Flight 77. He, too, preferred Visa.

Subject: Request for assistance in collecting visual artifacts
From: Colette Gaiter <cgaiter@UMN.EDU>
Mime-version: 1.0

Hello everyone,

There are people receiving this email all over the world. I have heard from
some of you regarding the tragedy here in the U.S.

I am writing to you because I have an idea for a way to use the internet to
create a useful public archive.

I have been working on a project called "Unofficial Communication." I have
received a grant from the University of Minnesota to research low or
no-budget personal visual communications intended for a large audience. One
way to think of these communications is as "private broadcasts." The goal is
to document and contemplate the significance and meaning of non-commercial
written and visual messages that individuals place in the public landscape.
With the help of research assistants, I have been collecting images of
graffiti, handmade flyers and stickers, personal "billboards", shrines and
other markers, non-commissioned artworks, etc.

After the horrible events of this past week, people have used "unofficial
communication" to write messages in ash on windows in lower Manhattan and
make flyers to try to find missing loved ones. Here in the Twin Cities I
have seen trees tied with huge red, white, and blue ribbons, stenciled signs
adorned with flags placed in boulevards, and a huge banner with a message to
President George Bush, among others.

I am asking your help in collecting more of these images. If you live in the
Twin Cities, please email me the location of something that you saw and I
can go and photograph it. If you are out of town or out of the country, you
can send me a description of the artifact. If possible, it would be
wonderful to get an image, digital or otherwise. You can email it or send it
to the address below. If you send something that has been published, please
let me know the source.

Please forward this message to anyone you think might be willing/able to
contribute something. Your contribution will be acknowledged with your name
unless you request otherwise.

One of my original motivations in pursuing this project is to show the
persistence of the individual voice even in this time of high tech media
concentration. As powerful as the news agency images of this past week are,
there are many more images that have stories to tell but will only be seen
on a small scale. I hope to document some of the messages that individuals
took it upon themselves to create and place where others would see them.

At a time like this, it is easy for individuals to feel small and helpless.
I see these signs and messages as assertions of personal power, indications
that people do not give up, but use whatever tools they have to send
messages to others. Regardless of the content of the messages, (and I am
interested in the full range of content) they are artifacts of this space in
time. They will be temporary, and because of the urgency in collecting them
before they disappear, I have taken the risk of imposing on you to help with
this project. If you find this request inappropriate or intrusive, my
sincere apologies.

If you can participate, thank you in advance for your help,

Sincerely,
Colette Gaiter

Thanks for this.  I might add that the mayor of New York City immediately
stood by Arab and/or Muslim Americans, warning those guilty of hate crimes
that the law would deal with them.  On a  related note, one station did
attempt to give voice to the far left.  What they got was a Sonny Carson
diatribe against most things American.  I can understand their hesitation in
repeating that, considering the current situation, though I don't agree with
it.  All views should be aired.  Best to you and yours, Bill

I=92ve written a report on part of my day yesterday, in part to record, and=
 in
part to try and write again. It was written on auto-pilot, to some extent,
but I=92m sending it out because I feel the need to try and connect with=
 what=92s
going on, and with other people, through writing. I think people are having=
 a
hard time functioning, and what I=92m writing through is basically an=
 attempt
to go to work. I can=92t bear this stunned grief internally any more, at=
 this
point, and I=92m not ready to try and put my writing head around the=
 intentions
and politics of the actions on Tuesday. Please respond in kind, if you want
to or can.

     Somehow have to get up and head out to Rutgers U. in New Brunswick to
teach an 11:30 poetry workshop. Anticipating a class of shell-shocked
students, I wonder what I'm going to be able to say to them and how to say
it, and start pondering the possibilities. Mainly need to keep myself calm
and focused, then encourage them to start articulating. The subways are
closed below 42nd St., so I need to walk up to Penn Station from the apt. I
share with Karen on 7th and A, currently part of the blocked off "restricted
zone" under 14th St.  Karen is supposed to teach at St. John=92s in Staten
Island, but it's impossible to get to Staten Island from Manhattan this
morning, so she doesn=92t go. It was just two mornings ago that she was on=
 the
subway heading downtown when the planes crashed into the towers and in the
Ferry Terminal when the buildings started to come down a few blocks away.
Waiting to find out if she was safe that morning was nerve-wracking for
several hours.
     The fumes from the blasts and subsequent fires were pervasive and=
 nearly
overwhelming last night. I had been as far downtown as Chatham Square in
Chinatown on Tuesday, but the winds didn=92t start blowing the smoke uptown
until yesterday. All of the East Village smelled like burning rubber and
steel. Many people covering their faces with masks and scarves. This morning
the fumes have lessened somewhat in intensity, but the odor is still strong,
provoking a disturbing feeling of omniscient dread within my sense of the
atmosphere. I try to will this feeling out of my imagination, mostly
unsuccessfully. Walk to 14th St and 2nd avenue, and pick up the first papers
I=92ve seen since Tuesday morning. As I keep walking I decide to stop in at=
 my
other job at Baruch College around 9 am to see who is there, and check in on
the state of the main office. I talk to one person, a supervisor named Paul,
with instant recognition that we both don=92t want to be there but need to=
 be
doing something so=85 I ask if I should turn in timesheets, as they are due
today. Feels petty to worry about this, but I=92ve just about run out of=
 money
buying extra groceries and knowing I need to acquire some masks, have money
on hand, etc. What is the state of money in all of this? He tells me it=92s=
 ok,
that I should try to come back and work later that day when I get back from
Rutgers, even if only to show up for a little while.
     Leaving Baruch I head to Penn Station, which was evacuated last night
because of a bomb threat that turned out to be a false alarm. I=92m struck=
 by
the difference between my neighborhood, where there is only the traffic of
emergency vehicles and police cars w./ sirens blaring and a host of=
 different
kinds of supply trucks, and this near-midtown area where life and congested
traffic on the surface almost appears to be as is, or as was. I=92ve never=
 seen
so many people staring hollow-eyed into space, even as they walk to their
jobs. And the traffic fumes are nearly as bad as the fumes downtown. I=92ve
been sneezing, coughing and red-eyed all morning, my sinuses feeling ready=
 to
burst.
     Arriving at Penn Station around 9:40 I instantly notice that people=
 only
seem to be leaving the building, which freaks me for a split-second, but=
 then
I see folks getting on the down escalator and I never break stride entering.
New Jersey Transit is running on a normal schedule, so I head out to=
 Rutgers,
a 55-minute trip. In New Brunswick all of my breathing and sinus problems=
 are
gone, which scares me. I meet my students, who slowly file into class=
 looking
hollow and glassy-eyed. We manage to have a real, engaged discussion about
what is going on, how to approach thinking about this situation, and how to
manage our imaginations and feelings. One student wants to talk a lot but is
constantly on the verge of spiraling, though he never does. A few remain
silent all class. Some have friends missing. New Brunswick is very close to
Manhattan, and everyone in the room is worried about at least several people
they know who either live or work in the city. One student has a family
connection via friendship with the family of one of the hijacked plane
pilots. I gently try to remind them that, as a class geared towards many
levels of communication, we can turn our work to dealing with this mad
reality we have been blasted into. Looking beyond the headlines and sound
bites, incorporating documentation, research, questioning, into our work.
Putting the news we can=92t find in the mainstream media into our own=
 writing.
Tracking our imaginations, in order to prevent, to the extent it is=
 possible,
ourselves from being overwhelmed by our emotions. Recognizing that we are in
a collective state of shock, and that this shock is going to change into
other states. Recognizing that a balance of perspectives needs to be
maintained in order to see most clearly, and that we need to articulate and
repeat our stories. Recognizing that most of the rest of the world=92s
countries have been through unbelievable levels of suffering, and that
international viewpoints will be vital to our understanding of what has just
happened as well as how our culture and society have instantaneously been
transformed. I ask them if they know much about Afghanistan, and there is no
reaction. So I feel the need to tell them they will be hearing a lot about
this country, and that its people are unbearably impoverished, having been
subjected to drought, invasion, civil war, and totalitarian rule for years.
That those people need to be thought of as people, not one country=92s name
only, or one man=92s name only.
     The class gives me some sense of relief, both during (once I realize I
can actually lead a discussion) and after. I=92m relieved to finally have=
 some
level of public-oriented responsibility to attend to, and that the students
are present enough to gather, speak, and listen. And I=92m not surprised=
 that
one of the most difficult things to talk about is the deaths of all the
firefighters, police, and emergency workers after the collapse of the first
tower. The pain from that news is still too close to articulate fully.
     Heading back to Manhattan is the next step, so I get back on the train=
 at
1:39 p.m., which again arrives and leaves on time. I have four newspapers to
read now, and am buried in their pages until we reach Newark. The train=
 takes
a very, very slow approach to Manhattan, and at a specific point when the=
 WTC
normally comes into view everyone on my car has their head turned in that
direction, southeast from our train. It=92s the first time I=92ve seen the=
 full
view of the skyline without the towers in person, and the slow pace of the
train adds an eerie, cinematic quality to the moment that I try hard to
repel, again mostly unsuccessfully. There are people on the car taking
pictures and shooting video, but no one says a word. The cloud of smoke
rising is somewhat lighter than yesterday, so there is at least some sense
that no more buildings have collapsed today.
     The walk back home from Penn Station is ridiculous and painful. I get=
 up
onto the street and see flags being hawked on just about every corner. I=92m
supposed to be looking for face masks because they ran out in our area and
Karen, I and others are having a lot of trouble with the smoke and dust.
Traffic is locked up everywhere, and several streets are less available than
others.  After picking up some masks in a hardware store on 29th St., I head
over to Baruch again, ca. 28th and Lex. But there are at least ten times the
amount of people in the area now as opposed to this morning. It turns out
that the Armory building across the street from the new Vertical Campus is
being used as a center for family members and friends of people missing in
the rubble of the WTC. There are more TV vans and journalists out than I can
count, scores of those color xeroxes I=92ve seen people carrying on TV=
 pasted
up in storefront windows and on the sides of vans, and interviews being
conducted on side streets. There are also military vehicles in the area, and
restricted access to Lexington Ave, plus more people walking with cell=
 phones
than I=92ve ever seen (underscoring the difficulty of getting and receiving
calls the last three days), and one huge just-installed satellite dish on
28th and Lex., or thereabouts. I can get back into Baruch because I have an
I.D., but there turns out to be no reason to be there. I=92m supposed to=
 have
drop-in tutoring hours from 5-10, and there=92s no one who is going to be
there, so I cross those hours out of my mind for today even though it is=
 only
about 3 p.m.
     Closing in on 14th St. I=92m nervous about two things: the checkpoint,=
 and
the fumes. More people with masks on are dotting the streets, and the fumes,
though lessened from this morning in intensity, are starting to hit me=
 again.
I put on a mask and cross 14th St., and despite there being a number of
police officers on the southwest corner, none ask me for I.D. (I have heard
from other people who were checked, including my brother, but all were
yesterday). Back in my neighborhood, which also happens to be where I grew
up, there is still no traffic, though many people walking around. I=92m=
 totally
exhausted =AD didn=92t really sleep the night before, but want to get home.=
 So I
do, and get back to the process of collecting news, trying to get in touch
with people unaccounted for, handling all of this shock and emotion,=
 figuring
out how to be and what to do, looking beyond the general news, and preparing
for more bad news.=20

dear list members,

our hearts go out to those affected by the
tragedy of september 11. but it is necessary to
show we are strong and not weak. also it is
necessary to just show solidarity for fellow
humans, and bond together across borders of race,
religion, politics. we should not pit ourselves
"us vs. them". this is a dangerous notion. so,
instead, we propose to get together and celebrate
"life".

please join us this saturday, in celebration of
"life and creation".

if nothing else, to see a familiar face,

The Milk Factory just compared Twine to both
Autechre and Mille Plateaux,
saying their music is "inspired by the work of
John Cage, Stauckhausen and
the electro-acoustic movement," and that "Twine's
evolutive rhythmic
patterns and multifaceted use of the same sound
sources create a unique
collection of avant-gardist musical forms, firmly
set into its own
cultural landscape, but open to the outside
world." They have new and
forthcoming releases out on Komplott (Sweden),
Hefty Records (Chicago) and
Bip Hop (France).

Moving Image Projections: FILMTEXT - "source

Subject:      surrealism in East Asia
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1" ; format="flowed"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Re Herron's very good bibliography below, surrealism was an
important, nearly simultaneous poetical development in East Asia as
well and that there has been a recent burst of good scholarship and
translation, esp. in the realm of Japanese surrealist poetry. Bc of
the very short lag time between surrealist publications and their
often very free Japanese translation in journals like Shi to shiron
and various book series, certain European elements, esp. those in
French, were very quickly incorporated/transformed.  It is perhaps
harder to distinguish between orthodox surrealism and high modernism
in Korean, Chinese and Japanese 20th-century poetries (analogous to
the same categorizing "problem" w Cocteau) for a variety of important
reasons and I hope it is unnecessary to point out that among
different East Asian surrealisms (between nations, between poets,
between differnt "stages" of one poet's career, etc.), there were
crucial differences, such as whether or not they were performed
within a colonial context, their relations to nationalism and
romanticism (for the latter, see Kevin Doaks's first book), etc.
There is much good new Japanese and Korean scholarship (I cannot read
Chinese scholarship); for recent criticism/histories in English and
French, see:

John Solt's Shredding the Tapestry of Meaning: The Poetry and Poetics
of Kitasono Katue (1902-1978);
Hosea Hirata's The Poetry and Poetics of Nishiwaki Junzaburó:
Modernism in Translation (despite the subtitle, Nishiwaki was often
"surreal");
Miryam Sas's Fault Lines;
My own Yi Sang special issue of Muae 1 (1995, U. S. edition; an
identically titled journal sprang up soon after in Seoul--am working
on a YS selected works now);
Lucy Lower's doctoral dissertation "Poetry and Poetics: From Modern
to Contemporary in Japanese Poetry";
Vera Linhartova's Dada et Surrealisme au Japon.

(One of c shd also mention Aimée Césaire as an influential surrealist.)

From:    Patrick Herron <patrick@PROXIMATE.ORG>
Subject: Re: surrealism suggestions?

Foundational
0.  The writing of the Comte De Lautreamont, especially Maldoror (perhaps
the most influential work and surely part of the foundation for Surrealists;
use only if you like to have something that "leads to" surrealism)

Essential (if I could use only 3 sources)
1.  Andre Breton's book _Manifestoes of Surrealism_
2.  Bunuel & Dali's film, "Un Chien Andalou"
3.  _A Book of Surrealist Games_: Captures the spirit of surrealism in a way
no other work has.  Is fun, wonderful illustrations and photographs, and has
games, plenty of games, as promised.  Compiled by Alastair Brotchie.

Wouldn't Skip
4.  The art of Salvador Dali, Lenora Carrington, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy,
Hannah Hoch, Marcel Duchamp, Frida Kahlo, and Rene Magritte.  This covers
cut-ups, photomontage, painting, and sculpture
5.  Luis Bunuel's "The Phantom of Liberty" (many other films of his are OK
but I think this one is the most "surreal")
6.  Benjamin Peret's _The Hidden Storehouse_
7.  Meret Oppenheim's art, especially "Dejeuner en fourrure."  Oppenheim's
fur tea cup deserves its own line here.

Very Useful (if you have the time)
8.  The dream sequence from Hitchcock's "Spellbound" - set by Dali
9.  _The Automatic Message, the Magnetic Fields, the Immaculate Conception_
by Andre Breton, Philippe Soupault, Paul Eluard, David Gascoyne
(Translator) - great survey of surrealist writing
10.  _SURREALIST WOMEN: An International Anthology _, edited by Penelope
Rosemont
11.  _Liberty or Love!_, Robert Desnos
12. _The Theater and Its Double_, Antonin Artaud
13.  The photography of Man Ray
14.  The work of Adolf Wolfli.  He was doing cut-ups, montages, and
automatic writing well before the word "Surrealism" was uttered. His
photomontages presaged Paul Klee's rhythmic art and Warhol's pop art.
Wolfli's music presaged minimalist and algorithmic music.  Wolfli was not
part of any movement but was actually a lifelong patient of a mental ward.
Breton was one of the early purchasers of Wolfli's work and help start
Dubuffet's famous Art Brut tour.  Wolfli was perhaps the only "natural"
surrealist.


Work by Jan Svankmajer may also be useful.  there's also an interesting
survey of Surrealism and its relation to alchemy called _Max Ernst and
Alchemy_.

I'm not smitten by Breton's _Nadja_ and do not include it.  If it were not
for any of these other works I listed above, I would have mistakenly
believed that Surrealism were as dull as _Nadja_.

Charles:

Thanks for the Humanity
(my allegiance now marked by capitalization
-- oh the power of typography, what flag can I wave?)
in your recent postings.
Network television, mainstream print media, my neighbors, my students ...
call for "retaliation"
(a word I have long hated --
I keep seeing "tail" in the word,
a going backward at lightspeed on the evolutionary path).
Your words, your vision, your voice,
have grounded the shaky ground.
I don't know why. I don't care to ask right now. They just do.

I'm almost as far away as you can get -- Moscow, Idaho --
yet I am, we are (a plurality we must all insist on),
all closer than we ever thought we would be,
than we ever would want to be.
I did not see the towers crumble,
yet the foundations of my world have been flung up to the surface.
What do I tell my five year old?
How do I talk to my five year old? (To any five year old?)
He knows airplanes (oh he loves those things that leave trails in the sky)
crashed into occupied buildings;
he knows people died;
he knows that even in Moscow, Idaho we are knocked off balance by these
events,
but what else will he know?
How can we help him know?
How can we know anything?

Initially I felt poetry pales,
poetry's nothing.
Now I don't know what else I can give him.

    Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994.
A `round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery by Brad
Brace. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
stellar, trajective alignment past the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative
metaphors for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of events...

A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual
impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless
present of the Net.

An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and
re-sequenced over time... ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The
12hr dialtone...

provocative, poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic,
pathological...  Evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest
on December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs  has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years`
worth of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the
ongoing publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each
12-hour posting is like the turning of a page; providing ample time
for reflection, interruption, and assimilation.

~ The sites listed above also contain information on other
transcultural projects and sources.

~ A very low-volume, moderated mailing list for announcements and
occasional commentary related to this project has been established at

This project has not received government art-subsidies. Some
opportunities still exist for financially assisting the publication of
editions of large (36x48") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet
quadtones bound as an oversize book. Other supporters receive rare
copies of the first three web-offset printed ISBN-Books.

Chrles Etal. This is a good  and as "rational as possible " (given the
surreally horrific events) to the situation. I have my doubts about the
possible "political" rationales etc but I can understand the "visceral"
response of those right in there. My strong feelings for you and others who
have lost people and for the destruction and the horror. As much as possible
we need reason and even love. Your point about poeple being a part of nature
I concur with. This matter hangs heavy.Richard.

I saw a Palestinian represntative explain that as soon as the palestinians
realiosed the extent of the destruction and the extent of the deavastation
to people and buildings: there were very many who condemned the attack.
their initial reactiona was jubilation. Now that could come not necessarily
from anti-Jewish feeling. A small nation whose people have been forcibly
relocated by what are an essentially very aggressive group (of whatever
religious beliefs) and who have (relatively) little power inthe conventional
military sense to couterattack - Israel being much supported and touted by
the US and Western Governments since before 1948 has undertakne hundreds of
quite vicious "terrorist" actions. This of course leads to counter attacks
and so on. Iraq tries to take Kuwait and the response is a massively
disproportionate response. Iraq might say that just as the US bullys
neighbouring states to "cooperate" thy had a legitmate claim to Kuwait.
  But while I am against the more militant actiuons of the Israelis I am not
anti- Jewish.  Nor am I pro Taliban. But I can see why various nations are
angry at the US.
  Of course this doesnt mean that the US is an "evil" nation: on the
contrary, it is one of the greatest nations: with a magnificent diversity,
culture, art, poetry, inventions, inventiveness, and people, and democracy
(such as it is its probably a very advanceed example). To counteract the
hate people need (and Alan Sondheim is right we are an international
community) to buy into all the paranoia and hype is, if any thing, just what
any terrorists - who may see themselves (possibly wrongly) more as
liberators or revolutionaries against capitalism -want: and paradoxically
its what the military-political hawks want: were even maybe planning for.
There are many suspects. Bin Laden eg is maybe a suspect: but he may also be
a "patsy".  There are millions of people throughout the world who arent hapy
with US international policy from Korea to the Vietnam and the various
actions overt or covert throughout the world to "destabalise" and so on.
  A war agaist terrorism is futile. If terrorism - or anti American or anti
capitalist action takes place - its because those terrorists (or many of
them) feel they have been wronged. So a war that "takes in" Pakistan etc
will create more Bin Ladens.
  An enormous education drive to explain and enlighten people throughout the
world about political matters in a truthful way has a hope of teaching
people everywhere about the forces (economic, political, religious,etc) that
are actually operating. has an attempt been made to talk to Bin Laden and
the Teleban: How much do we see Palestinians talking about their cause
without some Western commentator interpreting their response. Also, how much
do the Palestinians know about the complexity of the Israeli situation? What
about long lasting occupation by the US wher welcome with massive and
constrcructive aid? No retaliations: constant wisdom in the spirit of
Emerson and Benjamain Franklin and others. The greatness of America would be
NOT to go to war: but to look into the realities of these things.
  I havent got much faith in the British Govt. eg Blair seems to be one of
the world's major idiots...but the British have many people of wisdom as do
many other countries who are being misled into another insane war. It may be
short - long or short - but it wont go any way to solving the primal causes
of this conflict, these problems.
   Yes:bury your dead and grieve but dont shut down Pierre Joris and others.
My initial reaction was anger too - I'm thousands of miles away - but I had
to stop and think about these things. It IS very human to react with anger:
but anger is not inevitable. It is generally useless. Our only hope is
reason: I know where I stand. I deply feel for the US people but I have no
intention of supporting any war. Full stop. I would support a withdrawal by
the US military from all foreign bases including Saudi Arabia, and
considered withdrawals by the Israelis and more humane and economic aid and
educational aid (to be reciprocated as and when appropriate if needed) to
the East and Iraq and Afghanistan in particular. Richard.

Their motives may be explained and understood, yet the fact of their delight
is apparent, as it is apparent at all bombings of Israeli and other Jewish
Institutions around the world. Rather than a small minority, if this
demonstration was not immediately clamped down by the frightened
authorities, i'm pretty certain there would have been many many 1,000's
dancing in the streets. So in Bagdhad, Damasscus and unfortunately through
out the Arab World. Cultures of hate and resentment and deep seated
undemocratic racism boil over to extreme violence.

Hi Rachel -

I found this story early last week myself.  A few of us have spent some time
since then trying to verify it.  It actually seems that this "footage is a
hoax" is itself a hoax.  No one has been able to get their hands on that
claimed comparison footage or find additional information to support.

Further, it was about 6PM in Palestine when the news arrived.  Sunset was
reportedly about 6:50PM in Palestine.  The footage was filmed most likely
between 4PM and 6PM in Palestine.  It seems Naeem Mohaiemen *subtracted* 7
hours from the time of delivery of the footage instead of adding.  This
error was pointed out more or less eloquently several times on the Indymedia
link you provided.

Perhaps this goes without saying, but there indeed are quite a few people in
the Middle East and in even in America who are demonstrably thrilled about
the fall of the towers and actually celebrated the destruction of the WTC,
as you might imagine.  Many people hate America.

Perhaps we can count our world fortunate because the number of people
pictured celebrating was actually quite small.  It doesn't exactly look like
VJ-Day; thankfully the entire Palestinian community was not exactly dancing
around.  Many Palestinians were actually quite shocked, upset or in fear of
the actions and their consequences.  Yet the television networks here in
America did try to make it sound like everyone was celebrating and so the
USE of those images was clearly misleading.

Oh, this just in: the source just said that their claims were mere
suppositions:
http://uk.indymedia.org/display.php3?article_id=11546


On another note -- in fear of retaliatory attacks, the Iranian government
has been covering the news in a way sympathetic to the US, a position that
country has not taken in a very long time.  No one, it seems, wants to be
the US's target this week.

Best,
Patrick

Especially if the CNN and the CIA and the BBC are all cooperating: its
intersting that the BBC were there so fast with live footage of the events:
they are very subtle manipulators who masquerade as being "objective"....Not
surprised that those images were manipulated. Also the pictures (constantly
of Bin Laden with a gun - for all I know he's just some agent dressed up):
and what would we think if we saw Powell constantly with a machine gun in
his hands? Of course the News that the Palestinians get is also manipulated
by their Govts somewhat...but people need to be wary of the crap on
television...and they way in which events are portrayed  (by any news
agencies) especially now. Its a disastor, but its not the end of the world.
As many that died at the Trade Centre far more probably die each day in poor
countries from poverty. Richard.

Scott. That was agood email by you. How are you? This whole thing has a  - I
dont want to say surreal air - no dream, "traum", the issues are  bloody
complex. Did you see that the footage of the Palestinians celebrating was
taken about 10 years ago!! See Maria Damon's post. The media (even the BBC)
are subtly distorting this event...not to say that "propaganda" doesnt
happen in the Middle East.(How did the BBC get theere to give live footage
so fast if they didnt know it was going to happen?)  The Yanks are are
reacting (not some of the more intelligent on the list) like histerical kids
whose lollies have been stolen: is this thing so terrible? I dont think so:
such disastors occur all over the world. Probably as many people died of
malnurishment or car accidents on the same day if not more. God help the
Yanks if they were hit by a big attack! In the 2nd World War they held off
supporting Britain and they struggled on alone. Then they slaughterd
hundreds of thousands if not millions in Korea and then Vietnam and backed
the right wing regimes in the Phillipines and Indonesia (where millions of
Chinese "communists" were murdered ) and then there is the backing of
Israel....There's a lot of shit going down.Cheers, Richard.

dear list members,

our hearts go out to those affected by the
tragedy of september 11. but it is necessary to
show we are strong and not weak. also it is
necessary to just show solidarity for fellow
humans, and bond together across borders of race,
religion, politics. we should not pit ourselves
"us vs. them". this is a dangerous notion. so,
instead, we propose to get together and celebrate
"life".

please join us this saturday, in celebration of
"life and creation".

if nothing else, to see a familiar face,
off-list, as i am sure mark amerika, the alt-x
crew, rhizome.org and myself would welcome a
familiar face and some dialogue:

Media Sponsor: NY ARTS Magazine
(www.nyartsmagazine.com)

Sound Performers: Twine

The Milk Factory just compared Twine to both
Autechre and Mille Plateaux,
saying their music is "inspired by the work of
John Cage, Stauckhausen and
the electro-acoustic movement," and that "Twine's
evolutive rhythmic
patterns and multifaceted use of the same sound
sources create a unique
collection of avant-gardist musical forms, firmly
set into its own
cultural landscape, but open to the outside
world." They have new and
forthcoming releases out on Komplott (Sweden),
Hefty Records (Chicago) and
Bip Hop (France).

Moving Image Projections: FILMTEXT - "source
material"

"source material" from Mark Amerika's new
FILMTEXT project, a version of
which is scheduled for exhibition at his
retrospective at the ICA in
London later this Fall.

Net Art and Ebooks:

Projections of work on exhibit at the Alt-X site,
including work by Eugene
Thacker, doll yoko, BEAST(TM), Talan Memmott,
Digital Studies, ebr,
Hyper-X, and all of the new titles from the Alt-X
Press.

Alt-X Press brings to web-readers a must-have
library of uncategorizable
writing being produced by some of the most
provocative artists in
contemporary new media culture. This initial
launch of eight full-length
works of art is now available in ebook and Palm
Pilot formats and will
soon be available as Print On-Demand (POD)
titles. The eight titles
inaugurated here include previously unpublished
work by postmodern fiction
masters George Chambers, Ron Sukenick and Raymond
Federman, screen-based
auteur Nile Southern, new media stars Mark
Amerika, Alan Sondheim, Eugene
Thacker and Adrienne Eisen, and a collection of
Neuromantic Fiction from
the Black Ice archives. The best part about it
all? These ebooks are
available to you for free.

In a time of economic downturn and dot.com
uncertainty, Alt-X perseveres
and continues its mission to expand the concepts
of art and writing.

Alt-X: online since 1993.

Richard, sorry to chime in.  Rage, as any psychologist worth his degree with
tell you, is a normal response to the feeling of helplessness.  Stop beating
yourself up over it.  You are not a warmonger nor a racist, despite any such
accusations that might have shaken you.  I've been heartened by the balance
the List now evinces.  Reminders of USA virtues are leaking in.  This country
has much to be ashamed of, but also to be proud of.  We need to hear both
sides.  As a lifelong skeptic, I devour news and opinions from both
mainstream and independent sources.  I don't believe for a New York minute
that either one is free from spin.  Israel quite obviously views the conflict
from a perspective very different from its enemies.  From their point of
view, the racism, religious bigotry, warmongering, desire to eradicate a
neighbor is mostly on the other side.  Who's right?  Who has a lock on the
truth?

Several List members have cited Robert Fisk.  But there are others equally
knowledgeable about the region who have reached different conclusions
regarding responsibility.  Whose "scripture" should be our Bible?  I don't
know.  I'm reminded how weak is human nature and our understanding of it, and
our forgiveness of it.  Best, Bill

I don't see how this is not racist in the least. Ignorant at the extreme. I
doubt I'm alone in finding your post "profoundly maddenning, anger-inducing
and blatantly racist."
How anyone can portray the actions of the Israeli govt. as innocent, as you
post implies, is well beyond me. Indeed, how Bush and the media can paint
American actions as somehow inherently good (as though we were fighting
Darth Vader), keeps me awake.The US still supports Israel politically and
financially, doesn't it?  I thought the Palestine - Israel conflict death
toll that has been in the papers  needed little explanation. Is it difficult
to admit that no one is right?
No one is "trumpeting the infantada", but keeping perspective.

Their motives may be explained and understood, yet the fact of their delight
is apparent, as it is apparent at all bombings of Israeli and other Jewish
Institutions around the world. Rather than a small minority, if this
demonstration was not immediately clamped down by the frightened
authorities, i'm pretty certain there would have been many many 1,000's
dancing in the streets. So in Bagdhad, Damasscus and unfortunately through
out the Arab World. Cultures of hate and resentment and deep seated
undemocratic racism boil over to extreme violence.

   The concentrations of asbestos released into the air in NYC are neither
short-term nor long-term hazardous.  Among all the other things you have to
suffer/worry about in the New York area, that need NOT be one of them.  I
have been an occupational safety and health lawyer with the govt for 22
years, which has included work on OSHA's asbestos standard.  (OSHA's NYC
office was in the Tower; from what I've heard so far, all our people got
out.)

    Here's the Secretary of Labor's official statement on the point, as of
the morning of 9/17: "OSHA has been testing the air quality in and around
the World Trade Center for hazardous and toxic substances.  In fact, OSHA
Assistant Secretary John Henshaw and his team were on site at the World
Trade Center Thursday night.  I can report to you that, contrary to initial
press reports, preliminary sampling shows that currently there are no
hazardous levels of asbestos in the air in lower Manhattan as a result of
Tuesday's destruction."

    From what I know from my own couple of years' worth of work on the
health hazards of this particular toxic substance, I know this statement is
(unlike some Cabinet-level pronouncements)not bullshit.

"WR Grace Asbestos containing insulation was used at the World Trade Center
(WTC). James Cintani stated that Grace Vermiculite did not contain asbestos.
Unfortunately this was not true this material was 2-5 percent asbestos.
100,000 80 pound bags of this vermiculite was used in the WTC. In addition
9,150 pounds of MonoKote 3 was used at the WTC. Monokote 3 was about 20
percent asbestos. Therefore in total about 201,183 pounds of pure asbestos
fiber from Grace was used in the WTC."

Unfortunately, Grace was not the only supplier:

"In December T&N, formerly the largest asbestos company in Britain, reached
a favorable settlement with the Port Authority (PA) of New York and New
Jersey, the body responsible for JFK, La Guardia and Newark airports and the
World Trade Center. The PA had brought a $600m lawsuit against 37
defendants, including T&N, for asbestos contamination of municipal

"Chalk up one victory for insurers in the escalating asbestos-claims mOlOe:
the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey has lost a 10-year-old court
battle to get its insurers to pay more than $600 million for removing
asbestos from its properties, including the World Trade Center and New
York's airports. The judge ruled that asbestos abatement costs by themselves
do not constitute 'physical loss or damage' under the Port Authority's
all-risk policies. The agency is considering an appeal." [emphasis mine]

http://www.fumento.com/asbest.html
[interesting overview on asbestos problem]
Copyright 1989 by The American Spectator
"Coming soon to a school or office near you: a life-saving innovation that
could kill you, designed to correct a problem that doesn't exist, by
removing materials that aren't dangerous until somebody tries to remove
them. And guess who's going to pay for it." ... "For example, the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey is expecting to pay about $1 billion
for the abatement of just the World Trade Center and LaGuardia Airport. (New
York City law requires abatement if renovation work is being done, as it is
at these buildings.) ..."

Based on this information, it can be said with reasonable certainty that
several tons of asbestos were in the World Trade Center. With the dust of
the WTC now clouding the city, contamination is very likely, but measurings
of the dust should be taken before jumping to any conclusions. After my
search, some news media started to mention the asbestos issue, mostly this
ABCNews article which states that

The Trade Center reportedly decided more than 10 years ago to treat the
health risk by encapsulating the asbestos to prevent the particles from
being inhaled.

To my knowledge, "encapsulating" means that the asbestos fibers are simply
painted over, or that asbestos-covered shafts are sealed, to avoid direct
human contact and air contamination. With both WTC towers destroyed, this
"encapsulation" is of no relevance. What matters is the degree of
asbestos-contamination which is now in New York City. As school is supposed
to begin again tomorrow, this problem should be addressed as soon as
possible. Residents of NYC should stay in their homes, keep their windows
closed and shut down the air conditioning (the filters won't work on the
fiber)."

Based on the tonnage, this journalist calculates about 3 fibers per cubic
centimeter of air in lower Manhattan or downwind of ground zero; while the
EPA calculted only .0048 fibers per cc.  However, note also the ambiguous
reportage of much higher concentrations:

"Analysis of earlier air samples taken downwind of the attack site in
Brooklyn on Tuesday also showed lead, asbestos and volatile organic
compounds to be undetectable or at low levels of concern. The air samples
showed 0.0048 fibers of asbestos per cubic centimeter, below the level of
0.1 fibers per cubic centimeter Occupational Safety and Health
Administration standard for airborne exposure in office buildings, according
to the EPA.

In addition, three dust samples collected Tuesday at the collapse site and
others collected Wednesday showed low or nondetectable levels of asbestos.

OEDon¹t Be Stupid¹ < Protect Yourself

However, one dust sample collected Tuesday showed an elevated level of
asbestos, so the EPA is recommending wetting down debris to prevent
dissipation of dust into the air. Officials add that workers stirring up ash
and debris should wear respiratory masks and protective gear.

It's "one of those cases of 'don't be stupid,'" EPA spokeswoman Tina
Kreisher said. "If there's a chance, why not put on the mask?"

ABCNEWS Medical Editor Dr. Timothy Johnson said today on Good Morning
America that the air and dust measurements, the odor and evident dust in the
air indicate that very young children, the elderly and people with asthma
should stay away from the attack area, and workers should take precautions.

"I see people walking around without masks and I think that is foolhardy,"
Johnson said."

All around me, I see people saying let's support "our" president, support
America.  While I want to be very clear that I think the terrorist attack
was absolutely unjustifiable-- and while the attack has also reminded me how
much I love this country, if not, very often, its government-- let me be
equally clear that Harry's post is a good example of why I feel so uneasy at
UNQUESTIONING shows of "support," wherein too-easy leaps as to our
incontrovertible "goodness," the Enemy's irredeemable "badness," can be
made.  (*Are* Arabs as a whole the enemy?  In what ways are Palestinians
directly implicated in the attack?  Is this a war against Islam or a
response to terrorism?)

To call Pierre's post "racist" is completely incomprehensible to me.  The
word racist must mean something very different to you, Harry.  Perhaps you
could explain how you feel such an inflammatory statement is in any way
justified.

As for the reaction from the Arab world, & the startling new information
that the footage shown on CNN appears to have been taken in 1991-- I don't
have anything to add except to say, as respectfully as I can at this moment,
that news of Palestinians dancing in jubilation over this is at best very
questionable at this moment.  I'm sorry for your grief & for everyone's
grief.  We have a responsibility now to bury the dead, but we also have a
responsibility to find out the truth.

Joe is right that something must be done.  Can I suggest that that something
must be a search for justice.  This is something very different from what I
hear being proposed in the national media.

Hurling invective does not bury the dead.  Thoughtless revenge will not make
them return.

Love,

Mark DuCharme

It's far worse than merely irresponsible, if true, as I'm sure you know.  I'm
reminded of the old Soviet broadcasts that depicted the entire American
population as either decadently rich or oppressively poor.  The predominant
middle class was conveniently ignored.  I can't, off hand, think of a medium,

This statement reflects the temporary insanity to which I hope some of us
will plead when all of this is resolved.

"Economically deprived minorities" in other countries-- especially in
Eastern Europe, parts of Africa, China, and of course the Middle East --
know how well their counterparts in the U.S. are treated. They know that
American "economically deprived minorities" are not only free to assemble
and worship unharassed, but receive educational support, food and financial
aid, and lead lives of relative comfort.  We do not rape and kill our
minorities, banish them to the desert to starve, or massacre them one by one
with machetes.

I respect our desire to be realistic about America as a global bully, but we
need to keep in mind that America's role in the world is more complex than
that.  Also, that's not the only (far oversimplified) motivation for the
recent terrorist attacks.  Bin Laden et al have stated their intentions
against "America, Israel, and the West"; you know that means England,
France, Germany -- and yes, George Bowering, even Canada.

Down with any sort of jingoism or blind patriotism, and down with those
shouting "bomb Kabul," but down also with equally blind, knee-jerk
America-bashing and its oversimplified rhetoric, and the false sense of self
that is emerging in the wake of terror.  A more objective and informed
historical perspective would suit us now, however difficult it is to attain.

taylor, rob, bill, thanx so much for your responses, thanx one & all
(barrett, so happy to see paul goodman's name here!---always enjoyed
reading him in the early 70s)... very heartening to hear such
balanced, such informed minds amid the calls for outright bombing
(which i'm hearing from some close friends, sad to report, but that's
part of my crowd from childhood, what the hell)... i'm just beginning
to receive formal petitions for international justice and human
rights responses to this calamity, as opposed to military action...
better late than never (which brings to mind how important it is for
the left to develop a network that can respond as quickly as the
right)...

do you folks think we can pressure cnn to drop their "america's new
war" logo?... their production values, with that droning muzak over
the top of such horrific images, is starting to disturb me at the
psychic level...

bill:  i don't think i'm hazarding much in observing that many in
islamic nations will read our president's "we're at war" remark
(etc.) as "holy war" in translation (will someone please help me out
here?)... hence the need (e.g.) for a more sophisticated grasp of
arabic---this seems elementary, and i don't think it's the fbi alone
who requires same... yeah, the u.s. is a great place, the u.s. can be
a terrible place too, right?---like any country... depends where/when
you find yourself... and sure, i'm someone who wouldn't live anywhere
else, ok (i mean, i grew up here), and i greatly respect our
country's capacity for dissent (if you will)... also, i'm not really
interested in running down the u.s. (anymore than i am interested in
expressing my "unity" with whatever the bush administration decides
to do)... of course analysis, such as zizek's, and as barrett
suggests, is always necessary, but it's just that i prefer at the
moment political to ideological analysis (if i may be permitted to
distinguish the two a bit)... btw, and just for the record, nothing
zizek wrote caught me by surprise any...

but i fear it's our terrible side just at the moment that we need to
reign in, bill, and that we need to do so with due regard for the
(human) losses just suffered... ergo the need for a response of some
sort, yes... as i say, i prefer the language of manhunts and such
like... i've been most pleased to hear our govt officials attempt to
qualify their anti-bin laden sentiment, to attempt to distance
themselves from anti-islamic positions (in which regard, we seem to
be doing some better than a decade ago... but then again, we're not
doing as well as we might, either, this much is clear)...

bill---when i listen to cnn's (e.g.) televised funeral services and
the like, i hear christian theology over and over... now one may
regard this as simply the practical outcome of christian casualities,
but we in this country might pause to consider how this is being
heard on the other side of the globe, right?... "our" media channels
might consider this, right?... in fact---or is this too much to
ask?---the folks holding such services might consider this too,
right?...

i'm not a religious guy, bill---like you evidently... so i think,
too, that persistent references to "god" from the mouths of our
leaders will likely be interpreted as more christian ideology...

of course i can offer all this only as anecdotal observation at this
point... no doubt like most of you, i'm glued to the tv, to the
radio, to the internet... and trying to find people to actually TALK
to...

anyway, no wish to see hostilities escalate now in *these* regions,
that much is certain... so all i offer here, and i think i was plain
dumb to not say this earlier, is offered with my hands trembling as i
tickle these keys... with regard to which latter, alan sondheim's
sensitivities seem most appropriate to me at the moment...

peace, & hoping for the best---

As one who's previously complained of politix on the list, I ask your
patience -- wanted to just say that having been born, grown, and still
living in her district, I am very proud of my congresswoman Barbara Lee. I
hope others will speak up (incl Ms. Hillary "it takes a village" Clinton)

-- if you want to I have two petition suggestions, though it's hard to think
such old-fashioned tools will do the trick (esp as our electoral system has
been proven faulty) -- I suggest those at actionagenda.com and
actforchange.com (asking Bush to condemn remarks by Falwell and Robertson,
and to in general chill, respectively.)

love and hope to all

Elizabeth

On Friday, Anselm sent me this record that Jonathan has forwarded today and
asked if I'd type him up the few notes that in all honesty I never felt I'd
transfer. It was too much for me to rerecord a sequence of events.  He felt
certain that he needed and others might need some of the automatic responses
to this week of devastation and seclusion. A severe childishness seems to
have pervaded many I know and love here in town.  A public loneliness has
kept private in a state of normalized disregard....Childish, simple,
repetitive, trite___these bleak scratches seem, among others, as appropriate
as any.  Below were attempts at straightening out physical bends.  Riding
the subways on the 12th, from blood center to blood center, I don't think it
would be an overestimation to say that 70% of the people riding were
sleeping or nodding while counting off any number of stops--and this at 3pm.
All sorts of monologue were bracing the streets. Unedited. Often seemed
kicked out.
Craft felt eerily foolish. though what we are. is edited constantly.

when WE choose to grieve

Shame on
Everywhere smells like blood
Something I don't know how to smell
Sucking on an iron spoon
Burnt paper
As if piped into
Every tunnel where money grows
Is expressionless
8 million blinking babies
Mostly deaf and mostly ill
Wanting to sleep
Through all this dizziness
Stings the scar on your throat
Stitched together
Is no wood
This makes me nauseous
Writing this this
Most pointless effort
Distracting
Today when art is
Worse
Sleeping off the late afternoon                         9/12/01

--

This feels medieval
Assorted selves on broadcast
Human propagandists and revolutionists
Clock spun too many times round
On one calendar day
Sleep be not restful
For the hyper-protected
When sleep tells the story it always has
Mental patients scatter around
And speak the truth conscious
Monologues "romantic over
The Atlantic Ocean" even orphans fight now
The heart keeps giving out
Walking among the naked
Industry struggling to put his clothes back on
Cloth of toxins Fainting cosmos
Some are happy
Is hard to come by
And real as Hell                                                9/12/01

--

Blame

Downtown sick is sick today
Ambulent silence everything hurts
From the inside out and the
Worst tears are the tears that almost come
Everyone's asleep and tensions are high
On the train
Off the street
"Machines are fallible; remember that."                         9/12/01

--

the birds are louder than they've ever been
who do they have to compete with
I can feel my heart from the inside
and that's not a g$%$%n metaphor                                9/12/01

--

biting fingers buds are numb
and then we ALL    is blank again
and never stopped  walking
children will be     taught
that this can happen
a life is long
no matter how you bend it
that you can shape anything
is a mystery    and immense
the air is hysterical
we look to Canada
and other agencies
nobody has globs of glue
or whitewash enough to do this over
anyone somewhere can matter                             9/12/01

--
everything is insensitive
for having senses at all
the bloodlust hangs me head to toe
why people can balance
blood for blood is why
my body's breaking up   rings in
how young I am makes me
need to hug elders
hug them and shake them
like I've never been before
and I haven't and it's creepy
and it should be
as I drink it all to bed
for now       cuz earlier
children laughed at me
spooked beyond anything
I'd been before
is gone now
like standard notions of horrible bends
"Jon, I've never felt younger in my life."
"John, I've never been through anything
        like this."                                     9/12/01

--

you go to the movies just to come clean
of all the reality newly upon you
will be a thing
that haunts you
that should   like people
dying far away   far
away    like invisible channels                         9/12/01

--

It's like your childhood when I couldn't cry
an imperialism of youth
   kills you forever
and we are a
forever instantaneous and vast
sick as reality can get
I've never hated my country
as much as I hate it today
used to keep my eyes open as long as I could
to make it look like I was crying                               9/12/01

--

there's nowhere to go to be alone
which is what I need right now
which is what I need right now                          9/13/01

The Film-Video 5184


Completed tonight, 72 x 72 square pixels, roughly one pixel for each of
the missing. The visual image: high-density of computer-generated hairs
and scratches: random (visual) noise as content.

The audio: Slow tuning on an analog television through VHF and UHF sta-
tions: most of the sound is audio noise (including beacons and other audio
debris): sound-bites (sound-bytes) from a number of stations, almost all
covering the World Trade Center tragedy, are heard.

The relationship: Buried content in noise: noise becoming content: content
becoming noise. Cognitively: hairs and scratches appear as _noise genera-
tors_ drowning out speech, location, proper names, narratives. Philosoph-
ically: the difficult issues of 'making sense' of events: relationship
between background microwave radiation noise (read: universe-narrative)
and the struggling of event-description: the repetition of content-as-
reading and reading-as-content: the oddly mesmerizing effect of apparent
random sound and sight against the background of the black square filed/
defiled as defile or file of the missing: the smoothed computer-generated
imaginary of dirt/dust/clutter against the inert and always already de-
constructed surface of video: debris against and through technological
contradiction. Materiality of film, imaginary of video.

Content: Working late into the night, rendering over and over again, a
process of mourning, the creation of a film-video tombstone, tears and
therapeutic at the edge or lip of the grave.

>The War Prayer
>by Mark Twain
>
>It was a time of great and exalting excitement. The country was up in
>arms, the war was on, in every breast burned the holy fire of patriotism;
>the drums were beating, the bands playing, the toy pistols popping, the
>bunched firecrackers hissing and spluttering; on every hand and far down
>the receding and fading spread of roofs and balconies a fluttering
>wilderness of flags flashed in the sun; daily the young volunteers marched
>down the wide avenue gay and fine in their new uniforms, the proud fathers
>and mothers and sisters and sweethearts cheering them with voices choked
>with happy emotion as they swung by; nightly the packed mass meetings
>listened, panting, to patriot oratory which stirred the deepest deeps of
>their hearts, and which they interrupted at briefest intervals with
>cyclones of applause, the tears running down their cheeks the while; in
>the churches the pastors preached devotion to flag and country, and
>invoked the God of Battles beseeching His aid in our good cause in
>outpourings of fervid eloquence which moved every listener. It was indeed
>a glad and gracious time, and the half dozen rash spirits that ventured to
>disapprove of the war and cast a doubt upon its righteousness straightway
>got such a stern and angry warning that for their personal safety's sake
>they quickly shrank out of sight and offended no more in that way.
>
>Sunday morning came -- next day the battalions would leave for the front;
>the church was filled; the volunteers were there, their young faces alight
>with martial dreams -- visions of the stern advance, the gathering
>momentum, the rushing charge, the flashing sabers, the flight of the foe,
>the tumult, the enveloping smoke, the fierce pursuit, the surrender! Then
>home from the war, bronzed heroes, welcomed, adored, submerged in golden
>seas of glory! With the volunteers sat their dear ones, proud, happy, and
>envied by the neighbors and friends who had no sons and brothers to send
>forth to the field of honor, there to win for the flag, or, failing, die
>the noblest of noble deaths. The service proceeded; a war chapter from the
>Old Testament was read; the first prayer was said; it was followed by an
>organ burst that shook the building, and with one impulse the house rose,
>with glowing eyes and beating hearts, and poured out that tremendous
>invocation
>
>*God the all-terrible! Thou who ordainest! Thunder thy clarion and
>lightning thy sword!*
>
>Then came the "long" prayer. None could remember the like of it for
>passionate pleading and moving and beautiful language. The burden of its
>supplication was, that an ever-merciful and benignant Father of us all
>would watch over our noble young soldiers, and aid, comfort, and encourage
>them in their patriotic work; bless them, shield them in the day of battle
>and the hour of peril, bear them in His mighty hand, make them strong and
>confident, invincible in the bloody onset; help them to crush the foe,
>grant to them and to their flag and country imperishable honor and glory --
>
>An aged stranger entered and moved with slow and noiseless step up the
>main aisle, his eyes fixed upon the minister, his long body clothed in a
>robe that reached to his feet, his head bare, his white hair descending in
>a frothy cataract to his shoulders, his seamy face unnaturally pale, pale
>even to ghastliness. With all eyes following him and wondering, he made
>his silent way; without pausing, he ascended to the preacher's side and
>stood there waiting. With shut lids the preacher, unconscious of his
>presence, continued with his moving prayer, and at last finished it with
>the words, uttered in fervent appeal, "Bless our arms, grant us the
>victory, O Lord our God, Father and Protector of our land and flag!"
>
>The stranger touched his arm, motioned him to step aside -- which the
>startled minister did -- and took his place. During some moments he
>surveyed the spellbound audience with solemn eyes, in which burned an
>uncanny light; then in a deep voice he said:
>"I come from the Throne -- bearing a message from Almighty God!" The words
>smote the house with a shock; if the stranger perceived it he gave no
>attention. "He has heard the prayer of His servant your shepherd, and will
>grant it if such shall be your desire after I, His messenger, shall have
>explained to you its import -- that is to say, its full import. For it is
>like unto many of the prayers of men, in that it asks for more than he who
>utters it is aware of -- except he pause and think.
>
>"God's servant and yours has prayed his prayer. Has he paused and taken
>thought? Is it one prayer? No, it is two -- one uttered, the other not.
>Both have reached the ear of Him Who heareth all supplications, the spoken
>and the unspoken. Ponder this -- keep it in mind. If you would beseech a
>blessing upon yourself, beware! lest without intent you invoke a curse
>upon a neighbor at the same time. If you pray for the blessing of rain
>upon your crop which needs it, by that act you are possibly praying for a
>curse upon some neighbor's crop which may not need rain and can be injured
>by it.
>
>"You have heard your servant's prayer -- the uttered part of it. I am
>commissioned of God to put into words the other part of it -- that part
>which the pastor -- and also you in your hearts -- fervently prayed
>silently. And ignorantly and unthinkingly? God grant that it was so! You
>heard these words: 'Grant us the victory, O Lord our God!' That is
>sufficient. the *whole* of the uttered prayer is compact into those
>pregnant words. Elaborations were not necessary. When you have prayed for
>victory you have prayed for many unmentioned results which follow
>victory--*must* follow it, cannot help but follow it. Upon the listening
>spirit of God fell also the unspoken part of the prayer. He commandeth me
>to put it into words. Listen!
>
>"O Lord our Father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go forth to
>battle -- be Thou near them! With them -- in spirit -- we also go forth
>from the sweet peace of our beloved firesides to smite the foe. O Lord our
>God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; help

>with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with little

>Twain apparently dictated it around 1904-05; it was rejected by his
>publisher, and was found after his death among his unpublished

this from Safire I suspect (or hope, maybe) connects recent discussions =
here on poetic suicide and the recnt tradegdy:
". A more powerful weapon of radical Islam is its ability to erase from =
the brains of recruits the basic will to live. The normal survival =
instinct is replaced with a pseudo- religious fantasy of a killer's =
self-martyrdom leading to eternity in paradise surrounded by adoring =
virgins. This perversion of one of the world's great faiths produces =
suicide bombers.=20
How to build a defense against the theological brainwashing that creates =
these human missiles? That is the challenge to Muslim clerics =
everywhere, not to mention Arab governments fearful of radical takeover. =
In recent months, official Palestinian stations have been broadcasting =
sly evocations of suicidal martyrdom, and over the weekend, in a mosque =
in Peshawar, Pakistan, a radical cleric hailed America's black September =
as a victory for Islam.=20

Mainstream Muslim clergy need to step up in their mosques and in public =
- as many surely are now doing - to give the lie to the fanatics' =
perversion of their faith. It is for them, far more effectively than for =
members of other religions, to cite teachings from the Koran that forbid =
the murder of innocents and to warn that such murderers will suffer for =
their sins. "



but I'm at a loss at the moment.

Friends,


This story has been updated. I wonder if the reason I forwarded the
original story to so many people was because I so much _wanted_ to believe
that the footage was fake?  Any self serving smugness has been smacked
back in  my face. Italian activist playwrite Dario Fo has said that the
left must combat the misinformation of the corporate media with
counterinformation. I have realized that I have slipped into the slumber
that I arrogantly accuse others of inhabiting.

I'm learning a lot about my self these days.

Peace,
Kevin

have to check our
                              sources and i did. This is what i found.

                    CNN did not use images from 1991. I challeged the guy
who put this posting out and
                    here is his reply

                    Subject: CNN

                    Dear all,

                    Last September 13, I’ve sent an email to this list in
which I provided
                    some information about the falsity of the images of
Palestinian
                    celebration for the terrorism in USA, information
given to me by a
                    teacher. I spent the last day looking for that
teacher, and,
                    unfortunately, when I found her, she DENIED having
access to such
                    images.

                    She said that she was sure she had seen the images
back in 1991, but SHE
                    CAN’T PROVE. She was not willing to provide further
information, DENYING
                    what she had said before to a full class of students.

                    I sincerely apologize for this uncertain information;
unfortunately I
                    can’t prove the information contained in my last post;
IT’S ONLY A
                    CONJECTURE, THAT THOSE IMAGES OF PALESTINIANS
CELEBRATING IS FALSE.
                    I
                    bought the idea myself, and reproduced it for you
because of the
                    importance of it, in the case it was to be confirmed.

                    Whatever news I get I’ll pass to you.

                    Best regards

---------

COUNTERPUNCH.ORG reports that the CNN footage of Palestinians celebrating is
actually fake.  Researchers at a Brazillian University have found identical
footage from 1991.  Also note, it was night-time in Palestine when the news
arrived.  Please distribute this news widely as that footage is inspiration
for a lot of hateful feelings right now.

Hola,

Just a quick note to say I’m ok. I do work three blocks from the
trade center, but I was up the night before with, shall we say, an
upset stomach, so I called in sick that morning.

Love,
David

Subject:      Re: it's 8:23 in New York

I read the Poetics archive messages finally Saturday -
here from Milwaukee, looking for stories, traces, wanting
to know. Here it's been awful too and not least perhaps
ironically because of a *lack* of proximity to the
disasters so that too many people here wait somehow to
translate their responses into something which now turns
into a deplorable nationalism and ‘getting behind' the
war-bent ‘leadership.' For others there is a kind of
guilty worry about indulging in a removed trauma, as
though (as though) it is NOT ours, the problem of
authenticity of response wrenched out in the kind of
response your posted letter from Samuel Delany indicates
when he first heard of the attacks: no, this is a film
line, it's not real! But I worry too that I am not
allowed somehow to feel what I feel, which is a nausea
and immediacy delivered by images and fear of what's next
and the thought of thousands of dead people shocked out
of time and of course the knowledge that this happens
elsewhere in different ways and how must people in Bosnia
feel with all the sympathy coming our way - papa's hurt -
and isn't it possible to feel more sympathy for other
parts of world that we CANNOT see? Why can't the ‘new
war' be a new imagining of how we live? Maybe it's
terrible to say so, but a secure peace involves different
ways of living including such things as a treatment of
our transportation infrastructure as NOT a
customer-service series of competitive businesses but as
state-supported and carefully delivered ways for us to
reach each other. Trying to get people like my students
not to think of the otherness of this pain death and
disaster but as the home-ness of it - not as in a guilty
or angry refusal of guilt response, such as some of the
too-soon chastisements I've seen from overseas in the
media ("Americans, think! Why do so many in the world
hate you?" reads the banner in Sunday's paper). NOT that,
but the ‘21st-century war' as a re-imagining of how we do
our own country, not just ‘smoking out' the THEM from
holes. I have lived in countries where the sense of
personal safety was very strong precisely because of the
careful attitude toward national, urban, group safety. We
can have more of that - that more of that would be one
way of a useful and needed response to the terrorists'
terrible use of our openness against ourselves. All this
is part also of what I have been talking with students
about - not waiting for your ‘leadership' to say
something but trying to figure out what to say
YOURSELVES. And in another way too I feel awful because
in such times I ‘speak poetry' and I completely want that
not to feel like a distancing use of art but rather as
an immediate experience of what's happened, like Alan
Sondheim's ‘+' message as the names of the thousands
dead. I do want to speak poetry so I include here the two
poems I wrote since Tuesday. Thank you for writing about
what's happened -

My best to all,
Lisa Samuels

Date: Thu, 13 Sep 2001 06:43:07 -0400 (EDT)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a Press Release/Statement from the Black Radical Congress
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Black Radical Congress (BRC)
For Immediate Release
September 13, 2001

Bill Fletcher, Jr.

Terror Attacks of September 11, 2001

During this extremely sad and traumatic time, we extend our
sincere and heartfelt condolences to the families and loved
ones of all those who lost their life on September 11th. We
also wish for the speedy and full recovery of those who were
injured, and we hope and pray that in the aftermath of the
attacks, rescue crews can find as many people still alive
as possible.

The Black Radical Congress (BRC) strongly condemns the
horrific terror attacks which occurred on September 11th,
2001. The brazen murder of countless thousands of civilians
cannot be supported or condoned.

It is without question that US imperialism has brought
genocidal levels of death and destruction to people around
the world. Whether one looks at the situation in Iraq with
the continual blockade and air bombardments, the situation
in Palestine where the US continues to give virtually
uncritical support to the Israelis in their national
oppression of the Palestinians, the economic blockade
against Cuba which aims to undermine its economy and
weaken its population, or any number of other places,
one clearly sees the callousness and evil intent with
which US imperialism treats the lives and property of
others, especially non-white peoples around the globe.
Yet, even with a firm understanding of the causes of the
desperation, fury, and hatred of US imperialism, turning to
terrorism to fight global oppression and exploitation is not
an acceptable strategy. A clear and unambiguous distinction
must be made between radical/revolutionary political action
on the one hand, and terrorism on the other, regardless of
whether the causes that *appeared* to inspire the terrorist
action(s) are just. Open and unmitigated attacks on civilian
targets do not advance radical/revolutionary causes and must
be repudiated. Rather, such attacks inevitably antagonize the
populace, weaken any existing popular support, and help
legitimize heightened levels of repression by the imperialist
state against *all* progressive/radical/revolutionary political
activity, including increased restrictions on the civil rights
of the people.

We already hear, in the voices of those in power, calls for
war and vengeance. War and vengeance without a precise target,
but striking out blindly, is nothing more than self-serving
jingoism. Given the track record of the US, this could
include indiscriminate bombings or missile attacks, such as
the attack against the Sudanese pharmaceutical laboratory
two years ago, which was later found *not* to have been
connected with any sort of terrorist activity.
The dangers presented by the September 11th terrorist acts
do not restrict themselves to the external threat. We hear
on television and radio calls for changing the laws and
regulations in order to make it easier to conduct
surveillance and to carry-out covert operations against
potential opponents of the US. Rather than accomplishing
anything in terms of reducing the threat of terrorism, such
steps will eliminate basic civil liberties and strengthen
the existing tendency toward a racist and classist police
state. The police are already out of control and on the
rampage in communities across the country. We cannot afford
to further unleash their undemocratic and frequently
murderous behavior in the name of national security.
We should add here that the terrorist attacks have also
brought potential damage to the growing anti-capitalist
globalization movement. The ruling class has been making
noise for months about the demonstrations that accompany
the gatherings of capitalist globalizers. They have inferred
that these demonstrations will get increasingly out of control.
There is no question that the events of September 11th will
be used as a pretext to both discourage activity, as well as
to clamp down on any and all popular outrage with neo-liberal
globalization.

It is also critical in moments such as these that we
as human beings fight and resist popular impulses toward
scape-goating and racism. From almost the moment of the
first attack on the World Trade Center, there has been an
assumption floated within the media that Arabs or Muslim
fundamentalists were behind the attacks. The reaction to
the attacks is reminiscent of what we witnessed immediately
after the Oklahoma City bombings. There was a widespread
assumption that Arabs or Muslims were behind the attack on
the Federal Office building. Few establishment observers
expected, or led any of the public to expect, that the
terrorist could be -- and was -- a homegrown, white
American right-winger.

Therefore, it is important to reserve judgment until a more
thorough investigation is conducted. This is particularly
important given the anti-Palestinian/anti-Arab/anti-Muslim
bias of the media. The automatic assumption of the US media
is that Palestinians specifically, and Arabs generally, are
animals, or at best, fanatics with no concern for human
life. The just and righteous Palestinian cause is rarely
given credible time, and when offered, generally dismissed
by allegedly objective (but really pro-Israeli) commentators.
Therefore, in the current situation of horror following these
criminal acts, we must actively oppose any and all witch-
hunting and stereotyping which is bound to emerge.
Yet another danger we currently face will be xenophobia
and, general anti-immigrant sentiment. This will almost
inevitably be directed at immigrants of color and
particularly those who "look" like they might be of Middle
Eastern (North African) origin. The attacks on immigrants
and the condemnation of entire communities must be stopped
before they escalate out of control. We already see some of
this happening with numerous reports of anonymous death
threats sent to Arab and Muslim institutions, as well as
the spray painting of racist slogans and direct, personal
threats and attacks on individuals who are assumed to be
from the Middle East (North Africa). We call on all
clear-thinking people to be especially vigilant at this
time in making sure that in the aftermath of this tragedy,
another tragedy born of pain, anger, and hatred does not
occur. True anti-racism may require us to put ourselves
at risk physically in order to defend Arabs and Muslims
from unwarranted attacks.

Lastly, Black America must not condone or be indifferent
to the horrendous loss of human life resulting from this
tragedy, nor can we allow these horrific acts to be used
as an excuse to further repress Arab-Americans, Muslims, or
those perceived to be opponents of capitalist globalization.
As a people that has survived over 400 years of genocidal
oppression on these shores, we are all too familiar with the
human suffering caused by both terrorism and racial hatred.
>From the amputations, beatings, and rapes of Chattel Slavery,
to the New York City Draft Riots of 1863, to the post-
Reconstruction terrorism of the Klu Klux Klan, to the
Tulsa Race Riots of 1921, to the government sponsored
Counter-Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO) of the 1960s,
to the contemporary state-sanctioned police murder and
brutality we are fighting today, we as Black people have
lots of experience with the horrors of terrorism in the
US, as it has too frequently been directed against us. That
is why we must show our full and unqualified support and
compassion for all those suffering as a result of this
horrible tragedy, most of whom have come to experience
terrorism for the first time, as we continue our 400+
year struggle to rid ourselves of this evil, both
domestically and around the world.

There is a glaring fallacy in these arguments. One can either argue the
humanitarian aspects of this violence, or the political.

Under the political lens, the argument would go like this, "The US has stood and
currently stands athwart the express aims of certain Islamic sects. Therefore,
these sects are fully justified in wreaking whatever degree of warlike
retribution against the US they deem prudent, and in so doing, they are justified
in striving to effect their ends. This is so, even if they were to kidmap
children and use them as a means of attack against other innocent people."

The corallary to this is, "The Islamic sects have now and continue to interpose
themselves athwart the express aims of the legitimate governments in the Mid
East, and they have selected a wave of terrorism as the means to achieve their
political ends. In taking any and every step to thwart their aims, even to the
extent of using nuclear weapons to erradicate these individuals. This is
justified, even if it means that some innocents night be killed in the process."

The humanitarian argument would go: "There are ways to sit down and resolve
differences among people who have grievances. These must be the mechanisms used
to resolve disagreements like these. There can be no justification for the
killing of innocent people."

The problem is that the radical left argues the political , as a means of
justifying or rationalizing the attack, while arguing the humanitarian as a means
to render impotent any potential response.

It is a fallacious argument.

If the political justification is sufficient unto itself to mitigate or even
justify the attack, then it is sufficient unto itselto justify virtually any
response the US might effect.

If the humanitarian argument is to be employed, it must be employed both ways.

I rode my bicycle down to lower Manhattan on Saturday afternoon in an
attempt to get to "ground zero." I dopped off some things at the Javits
Center, and the void at the southern tip of the island kept pulling me
closer. I asked myself why I had the need to get there, and all I kept
telling myself was that I prefer an open casket, to see the body in the
coffin. At Canal and the West Side Highway, three kids on bikes told me
that they had just returned from Stuyvesant, that there was a way down
"there." I almost got there, but the cops decided to clear everyone out of
there. I rode east and tried to get there from the southern part of the
island. I got as close as Nassau and Liberty, and as I rode through the
smoke and ash and smell of electrical fires and death, I kept hearing
Ginsberg reading "Kaddish." I kept hearing Ginsberg reading "Kaddish." --Ak


====================


from Kaddish


- for Naomi Ginsberg, 1894-1956


Strange now to think of you, gone without corsets & eyes, while I walk on
           the sunny pavement of Greenwich Village.
downtown Manhattan, clear winter noon, and I've been up all night, talking,
           talking, reading the Kaddish aloud, listening to Ray Charles blues
           shout blind on the phonograph
the rhythm the rhythm--and your memory in my head three years after--
           And read Adonais' last triumphant stanzas aloud--wept, realizing
           how we suffer--
And how Death is that remedy all singers dream of, sing, remember,
           prophesy as in the Hebrew Anthem, or the Buddhist Book of An-
           swers--and my own imagination of a withered leaf--at dawn--
Dreaming back thru life, Your time--and mine accelerating toward Apoca-
           lypse,
the final moment--the flower burning in the Day--and what comes after,
looking back on the mind itself that saw an American city
a flash away, and the great dream of Me or China, or you and a phantom
           Russia, or a crumpled bed that never existed--
like a poem in the dark--escaped back to Oblivion--
No more to say, and nothing to weep for but the Beings in the Dream,
           trapped in its disappearance,
sighing, screaming with it, buying and selling pieces of phantom, worship-
           ping each other,
worshipping the God included in it all--longing or inevitability?--while it
           lasts, a Vision--anything more?
It leaps about me, as I go out and walk the street, look back over my shoulder,
           Seventh Avenue, the battlements of window office buildings shoul-
           dering each other high, under a cloud, tall as the sky an
instant--and
           the sky above--an old blue place.
or down the Avenue to the south, to--as I walk toward the Lower East Side
           --where you walked 50 years ago, little girl--from Russia,
eating the
           first poisonous tomatoes of America frightened on the dock
then struggling in the crowds of Orchard Street toward what?--toward
           Newark--
toward candy store, first home-made sodas of the century, hand-churned ice
           cream in backroom on musty brownfloor boards--
Toward education marriage nervous breakdown, operation, teaching school,
           and learning to be mad, in a dream--what is this life?
Toward the Key in the window--and the great Key lays its head of light
           on top of Manhattan, and over the floor, and lays down on the
           sidewalk--in a single vast beam, moving, as I walk down First toward
           the Yiddish Theater--and the place of poverty
you knew, and I know, but without caring now--Strange to have moved
           thru Paterson, and the West, and Europe and here again,
with the cries of Spaniards now in the doorstops doors and dark boys on
           the street, fire escapes old as you
--Tho you're not old now, that's left here with me--
Myself, anyhow, maybe as old as the universe--and I guess that dies with
           us--enough to cancel all that comes--What came is gone forever
           every time--
That's good!  That leaves it open for no regret--no fear radiators, lacklove,
           torture even toothache in the end--
Though while it comes it is a lion that eats the soul--and the lamb, the soul,
           in us, alas, offering itself in sacrifice to change's fierce
hunger--hair
           and teeth--and the roar of bonepain, skull bare, break rib,
rot-skin,
           braintricked Implacability.
Ai! ai!  we do worse! We are in a fix!  And you're out, Death let you out,
           Death had the Mercy, you're done with your century, done with
           God, done with the path thru it--Done with yourself at last--Pure
           --Back to the Babe dark before your Father, before us
all--before the
           world--
There, rest.  No more suffering for you.  I know where you've gone, it's good.
No more flowers in the summer fields of New York, no joy now, no more
           fear of Louis,
and no more of his sweetness and glasses, his high school decades, debts,
           loves, frightened telephone calls, conception beds, relatives,
hands--
No more of sister Elanor,--she gone before you--we kept it secret you
           killed her--or she killed herself to bear with you--an arthritic
heart
           --But Death's killed you both--No matter--
Nor your memory of your mother, 1915 tears in silent movies weeks and
           weeks--forgetting, agrieve watching Marie Dressler address human-
           ity, Chaplin dance in youth,
or Boris Godunov, Chaliapin's at the Met, halling his voice of a weeping Czar
           --by standing room with Elanor & Max--watching also the Capital-
           ists take seats in Orchestra, white furs, diamonds,
with the YPSL's hitch-hiking thru Pennsylvania, in black baggy gym skirts
           pants, photograph of 4 girls holding each other round the waste, and
           laughing eye, too coy, virginal solitude of 1920
all girls grown old, or dead now, and that long hair in the grave--lucky to
           have husbands later--
You made it--I came too--Eugene my brother before (still grieving now and
           will dream on to his last stiff hand, as he goes thru his
cancer--or kill
           --later perhaps--soon he will think--)
And it's the last moment I remember, which I see them all, thru myself, now
           --tho not you
I didn't foresee what you felt--what more hideous gape of bad mouth came
           first--to you--and were you prepared?
To go where?  In that Dark--that--in that God? a radiance? A Lord in the
           Void?  Like an eye in the black cloud in a dream?  Adonoi at
last, with
           you?
Beyond my remembrance! Incapable to guess! Not merely the yellow skull
           in the grave, or a box of worm dust, and a stained ribbon--Deaths-
           head with Halo?  can you believe it?
Is it only the sun that shines once for the mind, only the flash of existence,
           than none ever was?
Nothing beyond what we have--what you had--that so pitiful--yet Tri-
           umph,
to have been here, and changed, like a tree, broken, or flower--fed to the
           ground--but made, with its petals, colored, thinking Great
Universe,
           shaken, cut in the head, leaf stript, hid in an egg crate
hospital, cloth
           wrapped, sore--freaked in the moon brain, Naughtless.
No flower like that flower, which knew itself in the garden, and fought the
           knife--lost
Cut down by an idiot Snowman's icy--even in the Spring--strange ghost
           thought some--Death--Sharp icicle in his hand--crowned with old
           roses--a dog for his eyes--cock of a sweatshop--heart of electric
           irons.
All the accumulations of life, that wear us out--clocks, bodies, consciousness,
           shoes, breasts--begotten sons--your Communism--'Paranoia' into
           hospitals.
You once kicked Elanor in the leg, she died of heart failure later.  You of
           stroke.  Asleep?  within a year, the two of you, sisters in
death.  Is
           Elanor happy?
Max grieves alive in an office on Lower Broadway, lone large mustache over
           midnight Accountings, not sure.  His life passes--as he sees--and
           what does he doubt now?  Still dream of making money, or that might
           have made money, hired nurse, had children, found even your Im-
           mortality, Naomi?
I'll see him soon.  Now I've got to cut through to talk to you as I didn't
           when you had a mouth.
Forever.  And we're bound for that, Forever like Emily Dickinson's horses
           --headed to the End.
They know the way--These Steeds--run faster than we think--it's our own
           life they cross--and take with them.

           Magnificent, mourned no more, marred of heart, mind behind, mar-
ried dreamed, mortal changed--Ass and face done with murder.
           In the world, given, flower maddened, made no Utopia, shut under
pine, almed in Earth, blamed in Lone, Jehovah, accept.
           Nameless, One Faced, Forever beyond me, beginningless, endless,
Father in death.  Tho I am not there for this Prophecy, I am unmarried, I'm
hymnless, I'm Heavenless, headless in blisshood I would still adore
           Thee, Heaven, after Death, only One blessed in Nothingness, not
light or darkness, Dayless Eternity--
           Take this, this Psalm, from me, burst from my hand in a day, some
of my Time, now given to Nothing--to praise Thee--But Death
           This is the end, the redemption from Wilderness, way for the Won-
derer, House sought for All, black handkerchief washed clean by weeping
--page beyond Psalm--Last change of mine and Naomi--to God's perfect
Darkness--Death, stay thy phantoms!

II

                  Over and over--refrain--of the Hospitals--still haven't
written your
history--leave it abstract--a few images
                  run thru the mind--like the saxophone chorus of houses
and years--
remembrance of electrical shocks.
                  By long nites as a child in Paterson apartment, watching
over your
nervousness--you were fat--your next move--
                  By that afternoon I stayed home from school to take care
of you--
once and for all--when I vowed forever that once man disagreed with my
opinion of the cosmos, I was lost--
                  By my later burden--vow to illuminate mankind--this is
release of
particulars--(mad as you)--(sanity a trick of agreement)--
                  But you stared out the window on the Broadway Church
corner, and
spied a mystical assassin from Newark,
                  So phoned the Doctor--'OK go way for a rest'--so I put on
my coat
and walked you downstreet--On the way a grammarschool boy screamed,
unaccountably--'Where you goin Lady to Death'? I shuddered--
                  and you covered your nose with motheaten fur collar, gas mask
against poison sneaked into downtown atmosphere, sprayed by Grandma--
                  And was the driver of the cheesebox Public Service bus a
member of
the gang?  You shuddered at his face, I could hardly get you on--to New
York, very Times Square, to grab another Greyhound--

Americans cannot ignore what their government does abroad

Special report: Terrorism in the US

Seumas Milne
Thursday September 13, 2001
The Guardian

Nearly two days after the horrific suicide attacks on civilian workers in New
York and Washington, it has become painfully clear that most Americans simply
don't get it. From the president to passersby on the streets, the message
seems to be the same: this is an inexplicable assault on freedom and
democracy, which must be answered with overwhelming force - just as soon as
someone can construct a credible account of who was actually responsible.
Shock, rage and grief there has been aplenty. But any glimmer of recognition
of why people might have been driven to carry out such atrocities,
sacrificing their own lives in the process - or why the United States is
hated with such bitterness, not only in Arab and Muslim countries, but across
the developing world - seems almost entirely absent. Perhaps it is too much
to hope that, as rescue workers struggle to pull firefighters from the
rubble, any but a small minority might make the connection between what has
been visited upon them and what their government has visited upon large parts
of the world.

But make that connection they must, if such tragedies are not to be repeated,
potentially with even more devastating consequences. US political leaders are
doing their people no favours by reinforcing popular ignorance with
self-referential rhetoric. And the echoing chorus of Tony Blair, whose
determination to bind Britain ever closer to US foreign policy ratchets up
the threat to our own cities, will only fuel anti-western sentiment. So will
calls for the defence of "civilisation", with its overtones of Samuel
Huntington's poisonous theories of post-cold war confrontation between the
west and Islam, heightening perceptions of racism and hypocrisy.

As Mahatma Gandhi famously remarked when asked his opinion of western
civilisation, it would be a good idea. Since George Bush's father inaugurated
his new world order a decade ago, the US, supported by its British ally,
bestrides the world like a colossus. Unconstrained by any superpower rival or
system of global governance, the US giant has rewritten the global financial
and trading system in its own interest; ripped up a string of treaties it
finds inconvenient; sent troops to every corner of the globe; bombed
Afghanistan, Sudan, Yugoslavia and Iraq without troubling the United Nations;
maintained a string of murderous embargos against recalcitrant regimes; and
recklessly thrown its weight behind Israel's 34-year illegal military
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza as the Palestinian intifada rages.

If, as yesterday's Wall Street Journal insisted, the east coast carnage was
the fruit of the Clinton administration's Munich-like appeasement of the
Palestinians, the mind boggles as to what US Republicans imagine to be a
Churchillian response.

It is this record of unabashed national egotism and arrogance that drives
anti-Americanism among swaths of the world's population, for whom there is
little democracy in the current distribution of global wealth and power. If
it turns out that Tuesday's attacks were the work of Osama bin Laden's
supporters, the sense that the Americans are once again reaping a dragons'
teeth harvest they themselves sowed will be overwhelming.

It was the Americans, after all, who poured resources into the 1980s war
against the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul, at a time when girls could go to
school and women to work. Bin Laden and his mojahedin were armed and trained
by the CIA and MI6, as Afghanistan was turned into a wasteland and its
communist leader Najibullah left hanging from a Kabul lamp post with his
genitals stuffed in his mouth.

But by then Bin Laden had turned against his American sponsors, while
US-sponsored Pakistani intelligence had spawned the grotesque Taliban now
protecting him. To punish its wayward Afghan offspring, the US subsequently
forced through a sanctions regime which has helped push 4m to the brink of
starvation, according to the latest UN figures, while Afghan refugees fan out
across the world.

All this must doubtless seem remote to Americans desperately searching the
debris of what is expected to be the largest-ever massacre on US soil - as
must the killings of yet more Palestinians in the West Bank yesterday, or
even the 2m estimated to have died in Congo's wars since the overthrow of the
US-backed Mobutu regime. "What could some political thing have to do with
blowing up office buildings during working hours?" one bewildered New Yorker
asked yesterday.

Already, the Bush administration is assembling an international coalition for
an Israeli-style war against terrorism, as if such counter-productive acts of
outrage had an existence separate from the social conditions out of which
they arise. But for every "terror network" that is rooted out, another will
emerge - until the injustices and inequalities that produce them are
addressed.

Dear Friend of the Poetry Project,

Usually, this first e-mailing of the new season would contain a list of the
Poetry Project's upcoming events, workshops, etc. In light of the death and
destruction that occurred on September 11th, I first wanted to extend our
condolences to you and yours in the case that you lost anyone in connection
with the various terrorist attacks that took place on the East Coast of the
U.S.

Our federal, state, and local governments, as well as the news media, seem
to be urging that everything get back to "normal" as quickly as possible.
Let me encourage you to take what ever time you deem necessary to mourn,
reflect, or otherwise recover from the shock of the week's horrible events.

If you have been trying to reach us during the last week by e-mail, our
server has been down. It is only now (9/17) back in operation. You might
want to resend any messages sent to us after September 7th. The Project's
phones have been in operation continuously, though there have been
irregularities in New York City's telephone services. Mail delivery seems to
be fully restored.

Speaking for everyone at the Poetry Project, we look forward to seeing you
and hearing from you. Within the next few days, we will sending you
information about our fall programming.

With love,

Ed Friedman
Artistic Director

We must find those who have committed this monstrous crime.  But, there
must be a calibrated, measured and reasoned approach.  All our lives are in
the balance.  The planet is in the balance.  I do not want any more women
and children, elderly and general non-combatants killed or wounded in my
name.  If bin Laden is a suspect, why not bring him to the Hague and
produce evidence.  Regardless about how we feel re: legality, that has been
done for Milosovic.  He has not been killed to muffle his story.

And, I'm concerned about what the President said yesterday.  He called this
a "Crusade."  Does that encourage the idea of "Jihad" on the part of many
muslim people, worldwide?  Besides, how does that sit with all those
American non-Christians (I seem to remember something about the crusaders'
a slaughter of Jews on their way to the Holy Land).  Here, Civil Liberties
appear ready to be slaughtered, incidental to this Tenth Crusade.  Civil
Rights seem to be on the block.  Ironically, if there's a national ID card,
white America will finally find out how Black America has been living all
these years.  But, we must oppose the slaughter of our civil rights.  I
believe that if we don't like the news, we ought to go out and make some
ourselves!  "Protect Civil Rights," "Defend the Bill of Rights and the
Constitution," "Arabs, Arab-Americans and Muslims are NOT the Enemy."

The rich countries need to forgive the poor countries' debt. There must
also be a Marshall Plan for the world.  And, all known terrorists known by
their governments to be living in all countries, and/or sheltered by those
countries, should be apprehended.  If appropriate evidence is available,
they should be tried.  Among others, that would include Cuban terrorists
who have fled to the US. It might also mean members of the FBI and various
local police departments (domestic terror).  Likewise, members of the
CIA  and the armed forces (international terror) might also come in for
scrutiny on this basis.  The same should occur, e.g., in the UK, France,
China, Russia, Japan etc.

War has not been declared by Congress  (in 125 previous conflicts, the US
has declared war only 5 times) .  So "war" remains a political
metaphor.  International police action is a more appropriate term.  War
declarations make it just too easy to trash our rights.  Additionally,
there is no such thing as terrorism.  It is not an ideology or economic or
social system (e.g., feudalism, socialism. capitalism, communism, barbarism
etc., etc.).  There is no terrorism.  There are only terrorists.

The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

An evening with poets
SARAH MENEFEE & BENJAMIN HOLLANDER

Thursday September 20
7:30 pm, $7 donation
@ The Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

Two of San Francisco's more extraordinary poets, Sarah Menefee and Benjamin
Hollander are writers each possessed of a singularly distinctive voice.  In
each of their works, poetry's capacity for ethical encounter repeatedly
calls its listeners to witness the world in words.  Questions of justice,
compassion, and possibilities of active engagement and response recall
nearly abandoned purposes of literary art.  What is poetry good for?  Well,
in their words we can find out.

SARAH MENEFEE grew up in Reno, Nevada, and has lived in San Francisco for
over twenty years.  She's the author of two full-length books of poetry,
I'm Not Thousandfurs and The Blood About the Heart (both from Curbstone
Press), as well as numerous small volumes.  She has read her work in many
situations locally, nationally, and internationally, including two reading
tours of Italy, where her poetry was translated and published as Il Sangue
Intorno al Cuore (Multimedia Edizioni, Salerno).  Ms. Menefee works as a
bookseller, and an activist and advocate for homeless and impoverished
people's rights, in San Francisco.

BENJAMIN HOLLANDER was born in Israel and emigrated to New York City in
1958, at the age of six.  He has lived in San Francisco since 1978.  His
books include The Book Of Who Are Was, Translating Tradition: Paul Celan in
=46rance (editor), and Levinas and the Police, Part 1 (new from Chax Press).
In 1993, he visited the Fondation Royaumont in France, where selections of
his poetry were collectively translated into French and appeared as Le
Livre De Qui Sont =C9tait (Cr=E9aphis).  Mr. Hollander has directed The
=46loating Center for Poetry and Translation, a forum for writers,
translators, and scholars engaging in collective translations of
contemporary foreign poets.  He teaches critical thinking, writing, and
other courses at Chabot Community College in Hayward, California.

featuring Lawrence Ferlinghetti) get in free.

All Poetry Center events are videotaped and made available to the public
through our American Poetry Archives collection.  The first Complete
Catalog in over a decade detailing available Archives tapes will be
published in late 2001, including videos from 1974 forward, and audiotapes
dating from the early years of The Poetry Center , from its founding in
1954 through the early 70s.  MEMBERS WILL BE MAILED A FREE COPY OF THE
CATALOG ON PUBLICATION.

The Poetry Center's programs are supported by funding from Grants for the
Arts-Hotel Tax Fund of the City of San Francisco, the California Arts
Council, the National Endowment for the Arts, Poets & Writers, Inc., as
well as by the College of Humanities at San Francisco State University, and

brian, charles, gary et al: it's very meaningful and helpful to us not only
to hear that you're physically well and that other poets are well, but to
read your accounts of the eeriness, the hauntingness, the latent anguish in
everything, the fragility and resilience of all of us/you --it helps me
process, being so far away.  i consider it a privilege to read these
accounts. i emailed kamau brathwaite, not even knowing if he was in nyc or
b'dos, and he's okay.  anyone heard from cecilia vicuna, who lives on
hudson?  i've been moving incredibly slowly --even more slowly than usual
--the last week, sleeping a lot, showing up at social obligations where i
usually end up checking in about how i feel about "tuesday and after," then
leaving and going home to nap and read POETICS, which i think is
experiencing its finest hour, kind of like when ramez died, suddenly the
ephemeral connection we have seems to have sustaining powers.  adrienne
rich come as scheduled to read on wednesday night, taking a 13-hour hired
car from columbia missouri to minneapolis; what a trooper, and read "atlas
of a difficult world".  she really is a mensh.  her sons are in nyc, at
least one of them, who was helping to organize big meals for the local fire
station.  at my department party last night, which the chair insisted on
having because he felt we were a "community,"  and which i went to mostly
to be nice to him (a spiritual exercise i've adopted since school started),
i had conversations with people i don't usually talk to, about how we were
dealing with the calamity.  it was strange to me how *few* people had
connections in nyc.  weird how american flags are popping up all over, as
if nationalism were an appropriate response.  even the ethiopian restaurant
i met a friend at for lunch y'day had an american flag suspended awkwardly
from the airconditioner over the door --only the flag was made of paper and
brand-newly unfolded, which gave it an endearingly pathetic look.  at the
rain taxi board meeting, some people said they didn't mind the flags, they
felt as if people were just wanting to somehow express solidarity with the
victims.  so i thought okay that makes sense, i won't get freaked out every
time i see a flag.  a young arabic couple just moved in downstairs --our
only tenants --i'd been feeling protective of them but not wanting to
intrude on whatever their experience might be;  yesterday i finally went
down w/ a loaf of zucchini bread (from a garden i'd weeded "before"
--everyhing seems divided into "before tuesday" and "after tuesday") and we
talked about how numb and freaked out they were; she's a french teacher at
a k-12 private school, she said everyone had been told to wear red on
friday, but she hadn't gotten the memo, so when she showed up not wearing
red she thought, uh-oh they must think i'm making a statement --and he had
been writing his doctoral prelims and had had to stop in medias res ... and
was organizing their storage space in the basement just for something to do
...just as i was making zucchini bread just for something to do ...  today
i went to a party for a six-year-old girl and it was the first time i could
talk about something else.  the kids put on a puppet show in the hayloft,
"elmo in wonderland;" there were genuine laughs and a few nice exchanges
with the usual crew at that scene, and again, people were superfriendly not
like usual.  i'm supposed to be applying for sabbatical leave...how do i
describe my project: "materializing my wish that everyone be safe from
anger, confusion, fear, harm ... through poetry criticism????" well, why
not.

Subject:      if you would like to support congresswoman Lee
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Dear Friends,
East Bay Congresswoman Barbara Lee was the ONLY vote against giving
Bush sweeping war powers and as you can imagine, she is receiving
numerous hate calls and emails. She has shown tremendous courage in
her lonely vote to slow the race toward unrestrained aggression and
further destruction. She needs to hear from those who support her
position, because she is being bombarded by those who oppose her act
of wisdom, morality and conscience. Please send her an email of
support. Her email address is:
barbara.lee@mail.house.gov
In addition, sending letters to the editor would be helpful for her.
If you do that, please send her a copy
of what you have sent to the newspaper.  Finally, letters to the Bay
Area congressional delegation would be good.. while many agreed with
her position privately, they did not feel they could vote against the
measure. All emails to congresspeople are the same...the first name
followed by a dot, last name and @mail.house.gov
Other email addresses if you're so inclined to speak out:
President George W. Bush: president@whitehouse.gov
Vice President Dick Cheney: vice.president@whitehouse.gov
Peace,

So the "Crusade" of Mr Bush is not now "religious: the Crusadors were never
terrorists? Terrorism is never legitimate? Theoretically (eg in Christianity
or some interpretations of it in the Bible and the Koran (No?))it is wrong
to kill: but people of every religion have used terror (cf the Inquisition,
the Pogroms) for centuries: religion gets terribly mixed up with real life
and vice versa.
   Terror can be used as a legitimate defensive tactic: eg even when an
animal "bluffs" an opponent and thus less harm is done as one or the other
backs down. The Capialist system is almost literallly "policed' by terror or
its potential threat: or force of arms or "The Law"... I'm quite terrified
of eg the Police., which is one of the reasons I dont steal groceries...the
main reason.
  An ideal world is much more egalitarian than we have now: in such a world
the kind of exreme terrorism or suicide attacks or missions or whatever
would be much less likely to occur.
  Taking the point of this slogan though: probably most Muslims and most
Jewish people and most Christians etc could live without any antagonism
given that there was a more even distribution of wealth. Various peoples
have cohabited with varying degrees of peace and conflict for hundreds and
thousands years. But most "ordinary" people would not even want to kill a
cat let alone a human. These terrorists may be crzy but they dont just arise
out of a vacuum. Unless you buy into the Evil versus Good theory. The
Buddhists dont seem to a war-like lot but the rulers of the Christian world
and the Jewish (not the Jews not the Christians) seem to be or have been.
And lately the Muslims (extreme - so called) seem to be "counterattacking".
  The US will probably pick up Bin Laden or whoever quite easily but that
wont solve the problem of terrorism: or the inequalities and the
disaffection and the class struggles and nation struggles (linked to
religious or "philosophic" struggles). If the Tlaban are wiped out we migh
not see a particularly "enightened" lot taking there place. the US may need
to occupy Afgahanistan and then set aboput educating and genuinely assisting
those countries over there to "progress" or to really progress (if such a
term is pertinent or if there is such a thing). As the general level of
eduaction and standards of living slowly improve (and the Americans and we
New Zealanders and everyone in the "rich" West also "improve or become more
enlightened)...then maybe that's something the US-European-Russian etc
states can do. A small military action followed by real humanitarian
assitance and education of the West and the East: this is an opportunity for
the US. An opportunity not to threaten other countries but to use its vast
resourses to assist and buld those countries economically and in other ways.
The Chinese could aslo be involved - the US dont need a war with China  - a
cooperative international effort coordinated with a local effort could see a
world of relatively rich nations eg Israel and Palestine living together
 but probaly having their own countries) and without hatred.(That's where
the anti-Jewish madness needs to be countered). There are many educated and
"ordinary" Palestinians  and educated and "ordinary" Israelis who would see
that if the pressures of the military "hawks" of the so callled super powers
are taken off and people are not struggling to survive daily in many parts
of the world.
   My initial reaction to all this was also anger: but I am able to now
attempt to think about it...even or especially as I am not "involved" as
such: of course we all are as human beings. Ideally I would not want to see
one human being die.
  It is obviously a terrible tragedy that has happened to NY (how could
anyone actually hate anyone on the aeroplanes or anyone? Or
contradictorily,hate an abstraction eg "Capitalism" or "Evil"???) but
revenge by
your military is an unwise thing to advocate: understandable of course. If
Auckland was hit I'd probably want revenge...but the challenge is to
translate those feelings into a positive action. Impossible to imagine the
effect of the loss of one's loved ones. And despite the "symbolism" of the
towers etc I was (well a big part of me) is still fascinated by NY and they
entranced me those towers and I still have a map of Manhatten that I look
at. In fact I immensely enjoyed my trip there and found the people to be
very warm and I encounterd compassion when I was there when I "suffered" a
panic attack in a cofee place on 47th Street  ( combination of heavy
drinking and the sheer vastnessof New York compared to eg Auckland which in
comparison is a  tiny village!)...brusqueness from the hotel clerks but that
was amusing rather than anything...and some very good people around
Grenwich and in the Nuyorican and the Lower East side ..some poor, some
rich...the US is a great and complex and contradictory country. But on the
balance sheet there is a great positive energy and (overall) a great deal of
freedom: in the arts etc...sure this Bush election was problematic and so
on: but the US has some great poets (living and dead) has and has had great
inventors, musicians, jazz muiscians, artists, psychologists,
scientists,philosophers, Mohammed Ali, ....it is a country which teems with
possiblity. It would be bad for such a country to exact a vengeful war: now
is the time for rationality before we all begin to descend into the dark.
 By the way: I'm miles from this event but "part of me" feels that I'm
there: I dont have to say to the US  "I'm thinking of you" just about every
one in NZ is thinking and arguing about this situation constantly (there's
even a backlash here I think) ( Its a good thing people have differing
opinions however crazy.), and or but I cant stop thinking about it even when
I stop thinking about it: I try to rationalise it, to "abstract it", but
that is only fooling myself....why am I a poet tring to justify
killing?...can it ever be?...am I mad?...but who else finds that they cant
read right now? I cant even play Chess now...J S Bach (the computer..one of
the relatively weaker ones) wipes me out on ICC (The Internet Ches Club) I
won one short tournament then I found I couldnt  play ... got to get back to
reading. People are traumatised everywhere by these events: dont feel too
guilty if you find ourself saying and thinking "crazy" things. It is normal
to be crazy for a while (notwithstanding the above comments or withstanding
them).
  Thoughts of a dark mind in a dark time. Richard.

The Moslem extremists oppose Irael not primarily because they believe it has
violated the rights of the Palestinians, but becasue Israel represents modernity.
The Islamic "fundamentalists" are in revolt against the entire modern world:
freedom, Democracy, secularism, science and technology, modern education, women's
liberation, pop culture, modern music and art, liberal Christianity - the whole
works. Therefore, anyone who believes they can be satisfied by the USA adopting a
more "humane" policy towards the Palestinians is mistaken. Give the Palestinians
their own state, and it would become a tawdry third-world dictatorship just like
all the other Arab states. The terrorist attacks against Israel and the USA would
continue unabated. The Moslem extremists do not want "justice," they want to
destroy us and everything we represent.

You do not *all kill your minorities; but it does happen.

I like to think that UK is a relatively ok and safe place, and so it is,
generally, for me; but a taxi driver was just killed - he happened to be an
Afghan and some of our airheads decided upon their own little bit of revenge

The proportion of ethnic minorities in US prisons and sentenced to death is,
I
understand, proportionately high... Things aren't too hot in UK, but we have
done with the death sentence

As to machetes, that's often all people have and they do the best they can.
I'm sure that as countries can develop economically then USA and UK can sell
them much more civilised ways of severing limbs - I heard that arms
companies were one of the few whose stocks rose today on Wall St

I think that Maria has it right there. And so much for the creeping
thoughts from some parts that suggest that this is not poetics. So.

It is human to hear the on-site daily experiences such as Charles's,
and to hear the careful combing out of the political issues, and to
hear some stuff one did not know before. I was, for example, not
aware that CNN was using footage from 10 years ago to work their
magic against the palestinian kids.

I am glad to see no flaming.

See, the effects of propagands and superpatriotism are so subtle. I
mean for instance, there are a lot of people in the world who feel
negative thoughts toward the ease with which the U.S.A. gets called
"America", both within and without. They might say why not just go
ahead and call it "the world"? I dont say that US citizens do so
maliciously; they do it without thinking about it, which is one of
the little grating things that the non-US world has to observe every
day. Some people have, rightly, argued against Bush's claim that it
was an attack on Freedom. It is something like that to say it was an
attack on America. It was an attack on the U.S., on NYC, on the
biggest buildings in capitalism.

<The problem is that the radical left argues the political , as a means of
justifying or rationalizing the attack, while arguing the humanitarian as a means
to render impotent any potential response.>

How anyone can "render impotent" a 500 pound bomb is beyond me. The impotence, for
example the cycle of violence, can be discussed in both political and humanitarian
terms but not realistically in economic ones. And the fundamental attack is the
exploitation of Middle Eastern resources by the West and its fanatic consumption
fundamentalists e.g. no democracy is possible without free (sic) markets. The logical
expansion of this idea is do it our way or else. After all if this was an oil reserve
in Texas we'd be perfectly happy to let Qatar become a run down little...Oh, sorry
Qatar is one of the wealthiest countries in the world with universal health care and
free education through the University level. Wouldn't the Arab world, especially the
traditional one, be surprised to find that they couldn't run their affairs without
the likes of great western statesmen like G.W. Bush, Henry Kissinger, Spiro Agnew,
Allen Dulles, "Ruthless" Rumsfeld, Ronny "The Diseased Puppet" Reagan, Dan Quayle et
al. The events of last week have demonstrated one thing: this country has a major
surplus of xenophobic hicks. CP

Walter,

If I rember correctly a talk of yours at the Poetry Project a few years ago,
surrealism was used by a number of Korean(?) poets as a language of coded
communication, against authority.

Nice to see your knee still jerks ok, George.  Maybe "At War With the U.S."
is due for a reprint?  And just when was it you ran into Falwell, exactly?
I've been to Finland a number of times and it's a country I love very much,
but if you think that it's a model of tolerance check out their refugee
policy sometime...

Last week I forwarded this article to a friend of mine who is an
international news editor for a magazine -- here's her response.  I'm not
saying it's MY response, mind you, I'm just sending it out as a thoughtful
counterpoint.  -Aaron


+ + + + + + +

Milne has a lot of facts wrong, so it's easy to poke holes in his thesis.
Bin Laden, for instance, did not receive US support during the
Soviet-Afghanistan War. He was in Saudi Arabia and then Sudan at the time,
and not connected to the Taliban yet (because the Taliban did not yet
exist). Some fighters of what would later become the Taliban received US
support fighting against the Soviets. I can't summon this guy's sadness for
what happened to the Soviet Union's puppet regime in Afghanistan, and I
don't see its pertinence to where we are now.

Milne talks about how the US "bombed Afghanistan, Sudan, Yugoslavia, and
Iraq w/o troubling the United Nations." The UN adopted a resolution in favo=
r
of Operation Desert Storm. The bombing of Yugoslavia was a NATO operation
(of course US run), and Sudan and Afghanistan strikes were one-time Clinton
flights of fantasy to deflect from his personal troubles, but I guess we
have to live with those.

Then he talks about the "US global economy", which is a hilarious concept.
As you know, the US government does not run the global economy....you and I
do. It's millions of decisions made all over the world all day long, and
helped most especially by the US free market. The total assets of the entir=
e
rest of the world do not equal the size of US capital markets. It is self
evident that that happens in a free economy; not a dictatorship and not eve=
n
in the quasi-socialist murk of Europe. (how telling that at least 100
Japanese and hundreds of other Asian and European investor-broker types wer=
e
in WTC and likely casualties)

So if I was reading this in my living room with Milne across the way, I'd
look at him and say, "You're just jealous."

But then I do agree that we are arrogant and uninformed and there is real
need for humility at the moment. Having said that, I fully believe we have
the best form of government in the world. I thought this de Tocqueville
quote (in WSJ Opinion Journal) is clinching:

"Is it your object to refine the habits, embellish the manners and cultivat=
e
the arts, to promote the love of poetry, beauty and glory? If you believe
such to be the principal object of society, avoid the government of
democracy, for it would not lead you with certainty to that goal. But .=A0.=A0.
if you are of the opinion that the principal object of a government is .=A0.=A0=
.
to ensure the greatest enjoyment and to avoid the most misery to each of th=
e
individuals who compose it, then equalize the conditions of men and
establish democratic institutions."

History produced no greater admirer of America's promise, or of democracy's
broad, civilizing benefits, than Tocqueville. But he understood and
predicted many of the inevitable effects of a democratized society, one of
which was that there would be great downward pressure on the arts and socia=
l
manners. There would for a certainty be grand achievements, as democracy
spread opportunity among any brilliant mind, such as Duke Ellington's; but
in a land of opportunity, with many chances taken, much of our culture woul=
d
be half-baked and hapless.

...And so we keep sorting it out.

In my poetry class today at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, it
was our day to talk about "cliche" (apologies for lack of accent). I
pointed out that Bush has stated numerous times that the terrorists have
"roused a slumbering giant." This, in case you don't know, is a line
plagiarized word for word from the movie "Pearl Harbor."  In the movie, an
obsequious Japanase military guy says to the general in charge of the
attack on Pearl Harbor something along the lines of "well done," whereupon
the general shakes his head mournfully and delivers the "sleeping giant"
line.  It's important that we and our students know that our "leader" is
relying, literally, on Hollywood hackneyed script to rally support for a
bombing that will at best kill thousands of oppressed, starving Afghanis
while doing nothing in terms of getting at the scum who bombed my city.

And they are scum.  I must admit I've been a little creeped out by the
automatic good ole' priviliged lefty response on this list that critiques
Bush et al while, at least as far as I've seen, offers little in terms of
suggesting alternatives to the mindless, vicious retribution suggested by
King George the 2nd.  I've also been somewhat taken aback by the "Oh, how
tacky - everyone's waving American flags" stuff I've seen, as well as the
"they smashed the symbol of capitalism" type comments.  The fact that the
"flag wavers" are mostly working class people deeply affected by the
bombing - for example, my students' parents are the cops, firemen, transit
workers, janitors and secretaries that suffered deeply on Tuesday -- I
think calls for some restraint on our predictable critiques of jingoism.

Some restraint, that is, and just for now, while the wounds are still
gaping.  I hope to see all of you at the end of September in Washington
DC, where, if the "war" on the poor of Afghanistan happens, we can all at
least have a chance to voice our dissent.  I'm thinking my sign will read
"No to Star Wars...Yes to Airport Security."

all best, and peace,

This from a website on Pearl Harbor:

Imperial Admiral Yamamoto, who conceived, designed and promoted the Pearl
harbor attack, cautioned against a war with the United States. Having
twice held naval attache positions within the Japanese embassy in the U.
S. Capitol, he knew well the industrial strength, material wealth and
temperament of the United States. Overruled by his superiors, he dedicated
his efforts as Commander in Chief of the Imperial Combined Fleet to a
successful attack.  Upon completion of the attack he is quoted as saying
"We have awakened a sleeping giant and have instilled in him a terrible
resolve".

I'm thankful that this information of the 'false' images is circulating.
True or not this is a good time for people to be on their toes about news
spinning.

"I know of no people with less independence of mind that the Americans."
paraphrase of De Tocqueville (I'm not going to waste my time looking for the
exact quote for this.)

Aside from the U.N. being consulted on some of the U.S. bombing of Iraq, Milne's
article stands up. But I've read better than Milne's. It didn't take long for
"the editor" to run out of the few distortions she knew and resort to Jingo
Bells and abuse poor ol' de Tocqueville. But pretty tame and wisely circumspect
from someone who obviously doesn't know too much and whose job depends on
maintaining that ignorance. CP

Last year I was driving home over the crest of a hill near Punchbowl =
(and the National Cemetary of the Pacific), when I saw Pearl Harbor =
ablaze at 4 p.m. Startled, I was able to say to myself, "it's just a =
movie. They even got the time of day wrong."=20

When the twin towers fell, people on TV said, "It's like Pearl Harbor," =
or, "It's like a movie."

My mother remembers Pearl Harbor. She remembers wondering where it was. =
Who does not know where Manhattan is? The Pentagon.

I wish Allen Ginsberg had levitated the damn thing.

Ala Moana Shopping Center, once the largest in the USA, closed on =
Tuesday, as did public schools on the Big Island (though not those on =
Oahu or other islands).

Two days after the bombing, I saw "wanted" posters on telephone poles in =
Kalihi, a working class neighborhood in Honolulu. On the posters were =
color photographs of Osama Bin Laden.=20

Terrorist cells: cell phones (last calls).

"The instant politicization of our grief," says one email. Grief, by any =
other means, is now our politics.

So this is the sublime. We have crossed the Alps. This time we saw it =
happen.

Sunday, it rains heavily on the windward side. The mountains are covered =
by waterfalls, so many the mountains themselves seem to move.

My two-year old son, Sangha, plays happily with his airplane, hi fire =
trucks, his bulldozer. I think, thank god he's too young to be drafted.

All the calls ended, "I love you."

 I
don't see its pertinence to where we are now.

Like so many weapons of the freedom-loving west, he has been trained /
funded / backed by US and / or others. As the anger is against what he is
said to have DONE, surely who it is done to is secondary. The point is "we"
trained him to do it to somebody

| The UN adopted a resolution in favor
of Operation Desert Storm.

at a time when US was withholding money, ultra vires, from UN unless it did
as it wantess

| The bombing of Yugoslavia was a NATO operation
(of course US run)
that's right, without troubling the UN - actually it troubled them mightily.
& while the word _democracy_ is in the air, whoever got to vote for NATO?

| and Sudan and Afghanistan strikes were one-time Clinton
flights of fantasy to deflect from his personal troubles

well, leaving aside the motivations - this little crusade won't hurt Bush's
reelection - they were conducted without troubling UN.

So I guess the charge stands on the evidence of the correspondent's
refutation

| Then he talks about the "US global economy"...

I pass on the economics lesson. It's so self-contained. Whenever someone

| ...And so we keep sorting it out.

In UK _sorting out_ can mean beating up someone who isn't behaving as you
wish them to

Afghanistan is on the brink of starvation.

Regardless of whether or not they have harboured murderous criminals - and
they are murderous, no problem with that - I suggest that the USA and UK
(10% or so of the dead Americans were actually British) start flying in
*massive aid, gratis - more than we have ever before. All we need say is
that we understand what it is to face death, to feel one is without hope.
Here, have this, we are all the same. When you have the time, could you help
us find out who attacked us?

If we are going to have a crusade, let's do it the easy way. Let's
demonstrate the effect of belief in that God in whom so many of us trust

The destruction of a pharmacetical plant in the
botched Sudan raid caused, according to Noam Chomsky's
estimate, tens of thousands of deaths. Attempts to
kickstart an international investigation of the exact
toll were blocked, in the UN, by the US. Clinton's
libido may  have been behind the attack, but isn't it
worth asking why the 'personal troubles' of one
American can have such devastating effects?

Mime-Version: 1.0

from George Bowering:

I mean for instance, there are a lot of
people in the world who feel negative thoughts toward the ease with which
the U.S.A. gets called
"America", both within and without. They might say why not just go ahead and
call it "the world"? I dont
say that US citizens do so maliciously; they do it without thinking about
it, which is one of the little
grating things that the non-US world has to observe every day. Some people
have, rightly, argued
against Bush's claim that it was an attack on Freedom. It is something like
that to say it was an attack
on America. It was an attack on the U.S., on NYC, on the biggest buildings
in capitalism.

----

from me:
George, Please rest assured that there are plenty of US citizens who do
notice the very thing you complain of and attempt to avoid calling ourselves
"Americans". My first thoughts were similar to Lisa Samuels's, that I hope
we as a country can consider a new way of being in the world. One that is
more reasonable toward our fellow earthlings. The quick turn to easy
patriotism and religion that I see here scares me. But that is not every US
citizen's reaction. It is all very complicated. In regard to Richard Tyler's
post I don't think we need to be bashed for WW2 things at this time -- we
did help out. And I certainly hope at this time that the countries we are
expecting to help us, including Britain, make some demands on us in terms of
asking us to consider being reflective. This may all be a pipe dream of
course. Also though, please don't assume all of us go along with the version
of the USA you see on TV, especially not GWB's smokin-cowboy-cheerleader
ways -- remember, most of us didn't even vote for him. So we have troubles.
All of this is perhaps stating the obvious but it does need to be stated
sometimes.

Love and hope to all

well stated. thank you for this call toward balance.  Right now when
everyone is so disturbed it seems that opinion tends toward both dubious
extremes.

This aside, a progress report of life here in Brooklyn:

One close friend moved away already.  The post office is now accepting
packages and parcels again.  Many foreign friends are making plans to return
to their countries.  Our banks computers are now fully operational again.
The dollar store around the block which is run by Arabs has installed nine
security cameras.  Moving sale signs are rampant.  Of course lots of flags.

I woke up this morning and, with the local PBS station gone, scrambled to
grab a video to occupy our three year old son while we went about the
morning tasks (mourning tasks?).  Only the news was there and I couldn't
block it out.  I sat dazed for a moment by the FBI report which I can't even
recall now though at the time it made me so ill that I went back to bed and
left my husband to get our son to school.

In the last few months we have finagled a life of _independent poverty_ in
which very little is required of us, economically speaking, and we're more
or less free to do our art projects when our son is away at a state
sponsored school.  So, child delivered to preschool, husband returned from
the delivery and our day lives begin.  I revise a poem of shock but am
unable to work on any work from _before_ and unable to produce anything new.
I find myself envying the friends I keep emailing at their work places.
They seem to have something to do.  My husband, a musician, spends the day
reading some magazine we dug out of the trash the night before.  I stare at
various things and keep remembering a story I read about this whole affair.
It was from someone who was down there at the time.  He said he ran away
from the site in a screaming crowd for twenty minutes before he realized
that he was screaming too.

Thousands dead, millions deprived of civil liberties?

By Richard Stallman

The worst damage from many nerve injuries is secondary -- it happens in
the hours after the initial trauma, as the body's reaction to the damage
kills more nerve cells. Researchers are beginning to discover ways to
prevent this secondary damage and reduce the eventual harm.

If we are not careful, the deadly attacks on New York and Washington
will lead to far worse secondary damage, if the U.S. Congress adopts
"preventive measures" that take away the freedom that America stands
for.

I'm not talking about searches at airports here. Searches of people or
baggage for weapons, as long as they check only for weapons and keep no
records about you if you have no weapons, are just an inconvenience;
they do not endanger civil liberties. What I am worried about is massive
surveillance of all aspects of life: of our phone calls, of our email,
and of our physical movements.

These measures are likely to be recommended regardless of whether
they would be effective for their stated purpose. An executive of a
company developing face recognition software is said to be telling
reporters that widespread deployment of face-recognizing computerized
cameras would have prevented the attacks. The September 15 New York
Times cites a congressman who is advocating this "solution." Given
that the human face recognition performed by the check-in agents did
not keep the hijackers out, there is no reason to think that computer
face recognition would help. But that won't stop the agencies that have
always wanted to do more surveillance from pushing this plan now, and
many other plans like it. To stop them will require public opposition.

Even more ominously, a proposal to require government back doors in
encryption software has already appeared.

Meanwhile, Congress hurried to pass a resolution giving Bush unlimited
power to use military force in retaliation for the attacks. Retaliation
may be justified, if the perpetrators can be identified and carefully
targeted, but Congress has a duty to scrutinize specific measures as
hey are proposed. Handing the president carte blanche in a moment of
anger is exactly the mistake that led the United States into the Vietnam
War.

Please let your elected representatives, and your unelected president,
know that you don't want your civil liberties to become the terrorists'
next victim. Don't wait -- the bills are already being written.

Today's LA Times carries a fascinating article about the Bin Laden
family.  There are some 50 brothers.  One is a lawschool graduate in
Cambridge who has given Harvard a million dollars.  Another is a real
estate entrepreneur who has big buildings down near the wharf.  And so
on.  These brothers hate Osama and think he's a traitor.  They are
monarchists and resent Osama's being against the monarchy.  The family
is awash in real estate money--billions.  Think of what it means that
they are this rich while most Saudis are dirt poor.

So let's be a little careful of saying things like it's our fault that
Osama hates us so much!  This is pure nonsense.  Yes, it certainly was
Reagan's fault for training him to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
But even if he hadn't been so trained, given the vast wealth, family
quarrels, and so on, he might easily be moved to attack THE GREAT
SATAN.  Does this prove that we are indeed THE GREAT SATAN?

Why is it that poets and literary critics trained to look for nuances,
trained not to see things in black and white, are so extreme when it
comes to this terrible situation?

I wanted to thank all y'all (the plu-plural) for what has been some
of the most complex and nuanced discussion of what's going on that
I've seen from any of the art-related e-mail lists I get.

I've got one of those announcements that's unrelated to current
events: as usual, Mappings was produced several weeks prior to its
scheduled airing on Antenna, so there's no conscious response to
recent world events (though a few selections have a serendipitous
relevance to the politics and/or crises of the moment).

There are, however, lots of works that I think will be of interest to
folk on the Poetics list: music (for the most part, there are one or
two recordings of readings with no music) using texts by writers
including John Ashbery, Kamau Brathwaite, Charles Bukowski, Angela
Carter, Paul Celan, Constance DeJong, Gunnar Ekel=F6f, Paul Eluard,
B=E9la Hamvas, Nazim Hikmet, Naguib Mahfouz, Steve McCaffery, Snee
McCaig, & Quincy Troupe. Composers include Robert Ashley, Nicolas
Collins, Dave Douglas, Shelley Hirsch, Randolph Hostetler, Brenda
Hutchinson, George E Lewis, Alvin Lucier, Ingram Marshall, Matthias
Pintscher, Mikel Rouse, Kaija Saariaho, Tibor Szemz=F6 Saadet T=FCrk=F6z &
Mark Vigil.

The show went online at <http://www.antennaradio.com/avant/mappings/>
on Monday evening around 10:00 PM (-0700 GMT) and will remain online
at that URL for a week.

Hope y'all take time to tune in to the show. & thanks again for all the news=

Bests,

   It has taken me a week to think what I think. It begins:


                  SOMETHING BIG HAS HAPPENED:

                THERE ARE NO COMMERCIALS ON TV

        In the aftermath of the terror, 9-11-01.

        The immediate suffering and destruction occupy ones thoughts.  The need for
feeling is immense, but feeling is not easy.  No one knows what to feel.

        How many video cameras were aimed at the WTC Tuesday morning?  Television
seems to have an almost endless supply of new footage. We see it again and
again from many vantages on television and in our sleep.  It is all,
however, silent. The airliners hit silently.  The fire balls flare silently.
The towers collapse silently. The world has become a worse place for every
one.  For those in and near the towers, this worsening of the world must
have been experienced as incomprehensible sound, but for the rest of us, the
terror and sadness reverberate in silence.

        For those who believe in terror, for whom Terror is a God, terror
simplifies. The simplification is credible proof of the deity's power.
Fundamentalisms of all kinds-religious, scientific, economic, sociological,
ethical-all simplify, and the simplifications are violent and destructive
because the complexity of the world is forced into the City of the Simple by
way of a single, narrow gate.

        The god Terror has two kinds of followers-the agents of terror and the
terrified.  They belong to the most vicious circle.  The one makes no
distinction between the guilty and the innocent, killing indifferently.  The
others accept the terrorists' simplification and respond.  The greater the
simplification, the greater the reverberation. The reverberations of this
terror may become deafening or have already.  Those of us who were not near
enough to hear the first impacts are deaf.  We do not hear the explosions or
the screams.  How do we get out of this circle? Inside the worship of terror
the reverberating silence can only continue. It is necessary to multiply
perspectives and rise to higher levels of complexity from which many of
perspectives can be comprehended at once.  This is always the task of
knowing, but at certain times, the imperative is doubly compelling.

Well, here's my piss into the ocean.
xox,
Marcella

Dear President Bush,

This e-mail to you is to express my sincere desire that a careful, accurate
and patient investigation be conducted that identifies and punishes only
those responsible for this crime, rather than conducting a blind "crusade"
overseas that will only kill more innocent people. I want to express to you
my hope that every effort to preserve international peace be made by the
United States.

I live in downtown New York, a mile from "ground zero." My mother lives
seven blocks from the World Trade Center--she was shocked, traumatized and
is now homeless. I think I can speak for most New Yorkers when I say that we
are all horrified and shellshocked by the events of the last few days.
However, the last thing I could bear right now is for my country to
perpetuate more chaos and destruction for any innocent men, women and
children in the world, especially after seeing how awful it is firsthand to
be the target of an attack.

I appreciate that our people want justice, and I certainly want it, too.
However, I do not want it at the cost of any more innocent lives. I want my
country to be better, more intelligent, more compassionate, more measured
than that. A premature rush to arms may only prolong this tragedy and
permanently damage our position overseas. I want those--and only
those--responsible for this crime to be the ones brought to justice. And,
justice, for me, would be to imprison the perpetrators for their entire
lives (as they have so obviously demonstrated that being put to death would
be no punishment for them) so that they may reflect for years on what they
have done.

Thank you very much for your kind attention to my e-mail.

Sincerely,
Marcella Durand

here?)... hence the need (e.g.) for a more sophisticated grasp of
arabic---this seems elementary, and i don't think it's the fbi alone
who requires same... yeah, the u.s. is a great place, the u.s. can be
a terrible place too, right?---like any country... depends where/when
you find yourself... and sure, i'm someone who wouldn't live anywhere
else, ok (i mean, i grew up here), and i greatly respect our
country's capacity for dissent (if you will)... also, i'm not really
interested in running down the u.s. (anymore than i am interested in
expressing my "unity" with whatever the bush administration decides
to do)... of course analysis, such as zizek's, and as barrett
suggests, is always necessary, but it's just that i prefer at the
moment political to ideological analysis (if i may be permitted to
distinguish the two a bit)... btw, and just for the record, nothing
zizek wrote caught me by surprise any...

but i fear it's our terrible side just at the moment that we need to
reign in, bill, and that we need to do so with due regard for the
(human) losses just suffered... ergo the need for a response of some
sort, yes... as i say, i prefer the language of manhunts and such
like... i've been most pleased to hear our govt officials attempt to
qualify their anti-bin laden sentiment, to attempt to distance
themselves from anti-islamic positions (in which regard, we seem to
be doing some better than a decade ago... but then again, we're not
doing as well as we might, either, this much is clear)...

bill---when i listen to cnn's (e.g.) televised funeral services and
the like, i hear christian theology over and over... now one may
regard this as simply the practical outcome of christian casualities,
but we in this country might pause to consider how this is being
heard on the other side of the globe, right?... "our" media channels
might consider this, right?... in fact---or is this too much to
ask?---the folks holding such services might consider this too,
right?...

i'm not a religious guy, bill---like you evidently... so i think,
too, that persistent references to "god" from the mouths of our
leaders will likely be interpreted as more christian ideology...

of course i can offer all this only as anecdotal observation at this
point... no doubt like most of you, i'm glued to the tv, to the
radio, to the internet... and trying to find people to actually TALK
to...

anyway, no wish to see hostilities escalate now in *these* regions,
that much is certain... so all i offer here, and i think i was plain
dumb to not say this earlier, is offered with my hands trembling as i
tickle these keys... with regard to which latter, alan sondheim's
sensitivities seem most appropriate to me at the moment...

peace, & hoping for the best---

Joe, thanks.  I agree with everything you say about religious gestures and
their interpretations, but I also understand (as I'm sure you do) that much
of this country is Christian, and these services are meant to comfort
Americans who sorely need comforting.  This doesn't obviate our pointing out
the dangerous implications of religious "nationalism" on both sides.

I'm not at all knee-jerk certain that American policies are solely, or even
primarily responsible for this tragedy.  I'm not at all certain they are not
responsible.  To my mind, pre-conceptions are not a valuable point of
departure.  When I hear Islamic fundamentalists referring to the USA as the
Great Satan, I'm reminded that Satan represents less the oppressor than the
tempter.  It is our culture, our "liberal" lifestyles, our "decadence," our
belief in the equality of men and women that zealots find so evil, so great a
threat to their religious integrity.  Young people in that region are likely
to be attracted to our way of life -- hence a holy war to eradicate us is
god's work.
I don't think I'm speculating here since there is no shortage of public
pronouncements from certain voices in the region.  Perhaps a reversal of USA
policies in the region would temper the hatred of us felt by some; perhaps
not.

Are we innocent?  Hell, no.  Our Christian fundamentalists routinely
proselytize in unwelcoming countries, while pressuring USA officials to
support and defend them against those heading straight for damnation, if they
fail to accept Jesus.

This is all very complicated, and so sad.  Thanks again for your thoughtful
post, your evenhandedness.  Ah, shit.  As the Verona Prince said,  "All are
punish'd."  Peace and love, Bill

Actually, George, this is my remark, not Joe's.  Your point is well taken,
though people like Falwell are everywhere, it seems.  And the more
homogeneously white countries have not been tested as we have, so who can say
how they might react?  Then again, I'm not as familiar with Finland's
immigration policies as I perhaps should be.  Are their borders as open as
ours?  I like the idea of open borders.  It might be argued that the very
platform provided to the Falwell fools is evidence of this country's
tolerance.  Who knows?  Sorry for the confusion.  And for the perhaps too
inclusive remark.  Best, Bill

Subject:      The Flag as Transitional Object
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Like many other listees I am grateful for this opportunity to read the
(mostly) carefully considered statements on this list during such an
agonizing and frightening time. It seems to me that this is the most
important time in recent history to remember that all viewpoints and
responses are partial; each has a point of view; no one point of view
reflects the entire situation or reality. This, of course, is the essential
purpose of rational discussion and debate. That said I want to add one
point coming from my experience as a psychoanalyst. A patient of mine was
able to get close to Ground Zero. He was shocked and disappointed to see
some people taking snapshots of their children sitting on the rubble. In
this regard I spoke to him about  Winnicott's theory of transitional
objects. To paraphrase and greatly generalize:Winnicott discovered that
from early childhood on, people sometimes have a need for an object to hold
on to at times of loss. The fact that a lost object (person or thing or
experience) can continue to exist in the mind, sometimes by means of a
physical reminder, might explain a lot of behavior that otherwise might
appear incomprehensible.  A young child might get very frightened if mother
is absent, but feels better when hanging on to a blanket when she is not
there, an object deeply associated with her presence. This is one way that
we develop the psychological function of memory. This may help to explain
why people need to hold on to things like flags. I realize that there is a
darker side to this, that flag waving can represent symbolic support for
acts of war. Like many others reading the poetics list, this horrifies me.
But the psychological fact remains that during times like this we need our
"transitional objects" as Winnicott termed them. These might be headline
pages that people save, a photograph of a loved one, or an object that
belonged to someone lost. It might be a poster, a book or a poem or an
otherwise meaningless piece of rock. It seems best, at least to me, when
the object is also some writing which enlightens me, such as that written
by listees or forwarded by them. I try to remember this idea of the
transitional object when I hear of people's need to hold on to certain
things which upset me, like flags, which seem to imply support for war. We
can strongly disagree with one interpretation of someone's behavior, while
understanding other aspects of it. It seems to me quite possible to express
a desperate hope that in the process of protecting innocent people other
innocent people will not be destroyed, without condemning people for
expressing their feelings by means of flags. We are fortunate to have this
forum for considered discussion; others may need to further learn about and
value such precious democratic freedoms. And finally, exchange and
comprehension of crucial ideas calls not only for intellectual brilliance
and force but empathy.

Someone just sent me an article with this paragraph in it:

"This year, the U.S. continued a Clinton-era policy and committed more than
$100 million in foreign aid to Afghanistan -- making us the country's
largest humanitarian donor. In May, Secretary of State Colin Powell
announced an additional $43 million in relief, which includes 65,000 tons of
wheat, vegetable oil, blended foods, health programs and shelter. Naive
officials claim that none of this aid will go to the Taliban because it is
being filtered through international agencies of the United Nations and
non-governmental organizations."


Is this true?  I am as interested as anyone in knowing the facts.

I agree that we should not take any action that *in any way* would hurt the
people of Afghanistan.

  This turns out to be incorrect.

    Snopes.com, one of the urban legends sites, has verified that this is an

The footage, btw, was apparently shot by a Reuters crew in Palestine on

other celebrations; AP reported that cameras were confiscated, filmers were
threatened.  -- That said, even if it is real, to me it is also very telling
to see how few people were participating in the one snippet of film that I
kept seeing over and over again.  If you look in the background, other
Palestinian people were looking at what was going on and turning away from
it.

I'd have to agree with Marjorie here.  Bin Laden is every bit as
reactionary as Jerry Falwell and co., and nothing is as simple as
overascribing evil to either "side."  Motivation is complex and often

Below is what I think is a very intelligent and *honest*
insider's/outsider's view of Arab realities written by a Lebanese friend.
It appeared as today's editorial in the Lebanese daily _The Daily Star_ (an=

was also published by the Christian Science Monitor).  Finally, I can say,
here's someone who really understands where the problems of the Arab world
lie.

--------------------
US should have read writing on wall (by Fawaz A. Gerges)

 Sadly, I'm not surprised that the evidence for the most devastating
terrorist attack in history points to a Middle East connection.
I have just returned from the area after almost two years there as a
MacArthur fellow, conducting field research on how social movements,
including the Islamists, perceive and interact with the West,
including the United States. The writing was all over the wall.
For many Arabs, regardless of their politics, the US has replaced
colonial Europe as the embodiment of evil. In their eyes, the US is the
source of the ills and misfortunes that have befallen their world in the
second part of the past century.

Today, to be politically conscious in the Arab world is to be highly
suspicious of America, its policies, and its motives. For example,
radical Islamists blame the US for their defeat at the hands of the
pro-US Arab regimes. They claim that the West, particularly the US,
tipped the balance of power in favor of secular regimes by providing
them with decisive political and logistical support.  Reports about the
identity of some of the hijackers point to a heavy presence of
perpetrators with Persian Gulf nationalities. It is also likely that the
fingerprints of the defeated remnants of Egyptian Jihad and Al-Jamaa
al-Islamiyya will be found all over this horrendous terrorist attack on the
United States. Most of the lieutenants and confidantes of Saudi dissident
Osama bin Laden =AD the principal suspect behind the attacks =AD come from =
these
organizations.

As importantly, over the past two years, the Afghan-based bin Laden has
successfully recruited dozens of foot soldiers from the Gulf countries,
mainly Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, signaling a shift in his
tactics. This new development bodes ill for the long-term stability of
the pro-US oil-producing monarchies.  Unfortunately, bin Laden's
rhetoric has sunk deep roots in Arab soil. Hatred toward American
foreign policy has become solidly entrenched in Arab popular culture as
well as intellectual circles. Public discourse in the mosques and
newspapers is full of references to America's legacy of aggression,
manipulation, and subjugation of the Arabs.

There is legitimate Arab fury at America resulting from historical
conditions and an arsenal of accumulated grievances, such as its
preponderant support of Israel; its economic strangulation of
Iraq; its military presence in Islamic "holy lands;" and its close
association with the corrupt ruling elite.

However, many Arabs refuse to take either personal or moral
responsibility for their predicament.  This moral failure perpetuates a
sense of victimization and fatalism. It also provides ammunition to
terrorist groups, like bin Laden's, which are bent on waging a holy war
against the "great Satan."

Acts of hatred follow. On a visit to Hadramout, Yemen, last month with
my wife and two children, a few Yemeni boys chatted with us and
expressed a genuine desire to "kill" Americans for supporting Israel's
brutal oppression of the Palestinians. In their young minds, little
difference exists between US foreign policy and the American people; a
widespread phenomenon in the Arab world nowadays.

It is no longer just bin Laden versus the United States. Arab children
are being indoctrinated to hate Americans, thus providing a fertile
breeding ground for bin Laden's foot soldiers. My own generation =AD
people in their late 30s and early 40s =AD has also been socialized into
an anti-American mindset, which is difficult to critique
or deconstruct. America, it is often claimed, conspired to humiliate and
dominate the proud Arabs by corrupting their local elite and empowering
their hostile neighbors. Intelligent Arab men of letters advance
conspiratorial theories to explain Washington's conduct and animosity
toward the Arab and Muslim people. Many Arabs no longer distinguish
between their legitimate criticism of US foreign policies and almost
everything that America stands for. They dismiss American democracy as
being hijacked by the privileged few.

Blinded by anti-Americanism, Arabs see little good in American society
and overwhelming cultural and moral decay.  In their commentaries about
the indecisive results in last year's US presidential election, Arabs
evinced wishful thinking that the American empire was beginning to
crumble from within. Unfortunately, Arab politicians and commentators
invest more time and energy in denouncing the US than in understanding
and making inroads into American institutions and civil society. The
Arab world will not gain the West's respect by being just morally outraged
at US foreign policy. Arab countries are not taken seriously by the Western
powers, particularly the US, because they have failed to develop,
democratize, and normalize relations between state and society.

Economically and politically, the Arab Middle East is one of the odd men
out in the world race to democratize and globalize. Authoritarianism and
patriarchy are highly consolidated on every level of society from the
public sphere to the dinner table.  These shortcomings, not US foreign
policies, are largely responsible for the lack of Arab
development and progress.

Far from forcing Americans to rethink their stand on the Middle East,
this terrorist attack will most likely produce opposite results. It is
high time the Arabs take charge of their political destiny and fully
embrace modernity. This process requires structural reform from within
and total engagement with the world, including the eradication of
terrorism. It is then =AD and then only =AD that just Arab causes will be
considered legitimate.

It is an absolutely fine question, one which I ask, too.

I feel as though I'm living in rome, sometimes.  I imagine this is what it
felt like:  A semblance of civilization, a flourishing of the arts, great
entertainment (in stadiums!), technological and scientific innovations, vast
libraries, yet too much power concentrated in a handful of people.  Or a
single person.

I think democracy is a great way to organize a society, but it seems
impossible to work out how the franchise power is supposed to translate into
political realities on a day-to-day or hour-to-hour basis.

What we fear most, here, is the brilliance of the plan which has been at
least five years in the making - that the machine that hit the Pentagon
was traveling at 345 miles an hour, that the planes were not only taken
but maliciously piloted after five years of subterfuge and masquerade by
people without very much experience on passenger jets.

And what we fear is also conspiracy, for, finally, our predilection
towards subterfuge, belief in surface erosion, has come true with a
vengeance: Here we are, now, suspicious of our neighbors, redefining
ourselves as a nation, as individuals, against the rot that appears
to lie within and without. All those theories about JFK, Area 52, the
CIA, Martin Luther King, LSD, the fall of the left, turn out to be
true.

It's the trouble with cancer, existing for years in the body, springing
out hard, retreating to tissues and organs where elimination is pyrrhic at
best - finally, nothing escapes destruction.

"They hide in caves," live in vaginas, pockets of bodies which are both
feared and stases of desire. They are primitive, woman-like, they won't
come out and fight like a man; we'll have to go in and get them. They have
nothing to lose, they don't have big cities, nothing to defend.

They might as well be Jews, might as well be Arabs, might as well be
Women. The West slams into nomads with firepower; the fear, the menses,
remains unspoken as we overly theorize and articulate geopolitical
concerns, strategies, ideologies, positioning.

What they did, they were good at; what they did, they are good at, and we
don't know what that is.

Maybe the appearance of extremism as seen from your point of view is not a
failure of the skeptical to detect nuances, as you speculate, but instead a
demonstration of people taking responsibility as US Citizens to question the
activities of covert US Government organizations.  It cannot be denied that
Osama bin Laden was paid by the fruits of our own labor to learn how to
recruit and build subterfuge organizations.  People rightfully believe that
those skills, that those efforts, contributed to bin Laden's continuing
"success," and some people have the foresight to try to make sure we do not
go there again.  Many people not only in the US but also abroad, poets and
others, would like to see the US intelligence organizations become a great
deal *smaller* than they are now.  Many people are acutely and even
intimately aware of the criminal (not satanic) actions of various units and
factions within the US Government.  Some people would actually like the US
Government to meddle less, to kill fewer people on its rise as leader of the
"free" market.

Once upon a time many people all over the world felt the same way, and
rightfully so, about the KGB within the Soviet Union.  The US Government and
expecially the CIA, NSA, State Department, JSOC, JASON, and DIA have taken a
general hegemonic course of action throughout the world that is at least
partially responsible for feelings of resentment of the US across the globe.
These orgs have taken a path far more profane than Dzerzhinsky's KGB.
Sometimes those organizations have given harbor to the worst criminals
(ex-Nazi Gehlen), and sometimes they even participate in the worst of
atrocities against humanity (for example, genocides in Vietnam, Laos, Chile,
Nicaragua, Rwanda, Zaire/DRC, East Timor, Iraq, and so on).   The number of
bodies is large and about to get larger.  Those actions have benefitted
mostly the wealthy few but have unambiguously placed the average US citizen
at a risk much greater than imagined previously.

It appears that it is only your post that has reduced to a black and white
landscape the oppostion to war and brutal intelligence activities and other
exploitative behavior.  With all due respect, you're the only person I've
heard in a long time call the US or any government "THE GREAT SATAN."

Regardless, it is entirely possible that even if the US were merely a
wealthy country as it is now but did not support violent and repressive
activity across the globe that someone like bin Laden could appear and
attack the US anyway.  Sure, I'll give you that.  I will say it is highly
unlikely, but sure, I'll agree.  Be that as it may, that is not what has
happened.  Bin Laden's relationship with the more perverse aspects of the US
Government has underscored those very brutal actions and organizations and
capital interests of our government.

Nick,
      You might be on to something with discussion of transitional objects
here.  I'm having difficulty reaching an understadning of what happened and
am having difficulty fathoming the minds of the 'suicide bombers'.  Aside
from the lack of development (psychologically. chronologically, etc.)
perhaps adoption of a 'bomber' as a transitional object might help me make
some sense of this action (much like my adolesents' passion for knives,
melloyellojello, and TV).

    I'm not an expert on t.o.'s but it is suggestive?

I was just about to write in with that Oppen quote myself!!  Thank you
John Gallaher.  I can think of no one who understood or would have
understood what is happening now, today, better than George Oppen!

And today a new development.  Karen Gut, whom many of you know
(she read and spoke at the Orono Poetry Festival on the 60s a year+
ago and is a professor-poet-activist in Tel Aviv) writes me that the
reason Arafat has just agreed to a cease fire, or rather proposed a
unilateral one, is that Israeli intelligence has discovered that the
four pilots, esp. the lead one, Joseph Natta, was a Palestinian, and
so Arafat is very embarrassed and he is now begging for a "peace"
meeting.

And further: it increasingly looks as if the terrorist infiltration is
so great right here in the U.S. that I think there will be no attack
on Afghanistan or other places in Middle East at all.

And third: I think the novels to read RIGHT NOW are Andrei Bely's
great 1913 and Conrad's SECRET AGENT and UNDER WESTERN
EYES.  It's all there....

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I'd like to say once more how heartened (or at least profoundly touched) I
am by the vast majority of comments and commentaries that have emerged on
this list since the tragedy.  I'd also like to second the sentiment
expressed by Nick Piombino, Maria Damon, and perhaps others that one very
mature and compassionate thing we can all do is not be too "freaked out"
(Maria's words) by the American flag flying from porches and antennas and
such.  In a lot of ways the flag seems to mean something very different to
me right now from what it did, say, during the Gulf War.  We as poets are
capable of processing images in subtle and sensitive ways; I think the most
constructive way to process the image of the flag right now is as an emblem
of commingled hope, grief, courage, anger, solidarity, and a million other
feelings that can be consolidated into a positive social force--especially
if that emblem can be constrained to include the principles of love,
brotherhood, peace, understanding, racial tolerance and so forth that this
country has for so long aspired to embody in its ideal self-image.

As Marjorie Perloff just said, as poets, we are supposed to have some kind
of heightened capacity for perception of nuance, and that capacity can now
profitably be directed toward understanding the feelings of _everyone_ who
has been hurt by this situation, including the mainstream citizens whose
flag-waving might in other contexts upset us.

Of course this does not mean that alternative opinions about US
accountability for various atrocities should be silenced; recent posts by
Patrick Durgin, Taylor Brady, Elizabeth Treadwell, Charles Bernstein, Gary
Sullivan, and many others have been both politically critical _and_
sensitive to the immense human suffering that for some can only be expressed
for the moment in terms of a patriotism we have all taught ourselves to view
with suspicion or contempt.  The challenge before us as "creative writers"
and speakers is to find ways of being in public dialogue that allow us to
remain true to our convictions _without_ needlessly rubbing salt in the
wounds of the populace.  Right now, pain is one of the most real things
there is, and to discount anyone's means of expressing it (as long as those
means don't involve acts of aggression and intolerance) is a big mistake.
Diplomacy is a domestic necessity as well as a global one, interpersonal as
well as international.

So: reimagining patriotism as a progressive, healing force.  I am tired and
disoriented--frazzled--right now, but I don't think this is a completely
irrational idea.  "Patriot" has a lot of baggage as a word, and for some it
may be very difficult to accept it in any form (it's the name of a
_missile_, after all), but maybe one of the sacrifices we need to make is
our hypersensitivity to etymological connotation, in the name of a greater
good: making and keeping as many friends as possible.

That all said, let's keep the petitions and letters to Bush urging restraint
et al. flowing, and thank you all for the community you provide.  The list
has given my life just that crucial little extra bit of sanity over the last
week.

Marjorie,

I appreciate the call for nuance in your post. At a time like this, we all
need to do what we can to keep people at the table, rather than running for
the armory. Facile exaggerations and distortions of others' positions, given
the passions unleashed (and often cynically _mobilized_, but I guess that's
another story) since last week, will tend to drive us toward the latter and
away from the former.

It's the direction you take getting to that invocation of nuance that
troubles me. Beginning where you begin, then: If your list of the properties
of the bin Laden family is meant as material support for the claim that
Osama bin Laden is finally accountable, in both the moral and criminal
senses, to himself alone for whatever acts of terror he has committed, then
I'd venture to say you'll find few here to disagree with you. (This assumes,
of course, that the evidence withheld as a matter of security by U.S.
intelligence sources is ever actually produced). The slaughter of
non-combatants to make a political point is _never_ excusable, and the
commission of such acts by one in a position of privilege and power is, if
anything, farther along on the scale of evils.

(One wishes, of course, that someone had held Madeleine Albright to such a
high standard, as spokesperson for the policy of the "world's sole remaining
super power," in the wake of her remarks that the hundreds of thousands of
Iraqi civilians killed as a result of the Gulf War and ensuing blockade were
an "acceptable cost." To many of us, that sounds less like a justification
and more like a defiant admission of guilt).

(One wishes, as well, that the current U.S. administration had such a
finely-tuned moral compass. Perhaps then we would not be witnessing the
closure of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border to the food and medical relief
workers who have, for the last two decades, kept millions in the latter
country just this side of starvation and epidemic. With this single act,
Bush's war machine has made it clear that, whatever else the "anti-terrorism
campaign" turns out to be, it most certainly _will_ be a war against some of
the most desperately poor civilians in the world).

So, if your enumeration of bin Laden's wealth means to make the case for his
political-economic autonomy, and thus the freely chosen nature of his
(presumed) actions, I'd put at least even money on your finding little in
the way of a dissenting voice here. And were it simply a matter of his
personal hatreds, or even actual crimes he himself had committed, we could
leave it at that, and switch genres from apocalypse to police procedural.
But the fact that, by all accounts, the man in question commands or works in
collaboration with an international network of guerrilla fighters,
terrorists, and potential or actual suicide bombers gives me pause.
Collective phenomena like this don't simply spring from the ground (unless
it be a carefully salted, Carthaginian ground), especially not in versions
this extreme, this redolent of people who perceive, rightly or wrongly, that
they have nothing to lose.

The ground for ideological fanaticism is well prepared. Here, certainly,
right-wing theocratic distortions of Islam bear a large share of
responsibility. However, religion alone is rarely an explanation. As with
all ideologies, its material effect depends on its articulation by a
political economy. And for that political economy -- specifically, the oil
monarchies (installed for the most part by the British and maintained by the
U.S. according to the Kissinger doctrine of "factors of stability"),
"friends of democracy" (Israel, the largest recipient of U.S. military aid,
pursues a policy of forcible conquest and the creation of "facts on the
ground" with our express approval), secular tyrannies (Saddam Hussein's
Ba'athist regime a long-time client of U.S. military and intelligence aid,
for its utility against Iran and its liquidation of Iraq's internal
communist movement), and revanchist theocracies (the Taliban a logical
endgame of U.S.-Soviet power struggles in Afghanistan, supported in its
earier guerrilla incarnations by U.S. and U.S.-aligned elements in Pakistani
intelligence, and even in its hegemonic incarnation -- if one can speak of a
hegemony in a country as decimated as Afghanistan -- initially unopposed by
the U.S.) -- for that political economy, the U.S. and "the West" have much
explaining to do. And that's without beginning to explore the extent to
which the organizational reality of these "terror cells" themselves might be
grounded in common experience with U.S. and "Western" intelligence and
paramilitary training.

Does any of this history mitigate the atrocity of last Tuesday's attacks?
Not in the slightest.

Does it help to explain where those attacks came from, geopolitically and
ideologically? Yes.

Does it serve as a fundamental caution against pursuing the simple
intensification of a century's failed and murderous policy in the regions in
question, and alert us to the very real possibility that U.S. military
"solutions" could greatly exacerbate the problem? Emphatically, yes.

Does it remind us that a war on any state or individual, anywhere, that
condones terror or gives material aid to its authors might find a surfeit of
targets before it even left the Beltway? Absolutely.

On these issues, I believe we have a legitimate disagreement. I'm happy to
disagree thus, as I find such dispute to be the core of democratic
discourse. I'm also fairly sure that I'm right on this one. But the
implications with which you end your second paragraph overstep the bounds of
argument and approach the sort of invective I've come to expect in the last
few days from the man who overhears me talking on the bus and tells me that
I'm "worse than the terrorists," or the woman at the coffee shop on my block
who approaches my table, breaking me off in the middle of a sentence to tell
me that "people who hate America make me want to puke." (I can only hope she
paid well for that latte before she disgorged it).

That seems to be the direction in which the following remarks tend:

        But even if he hadn't been so trained, given the vast wealth, family
quarrels, and so on,    he might easily be moved to attack THE GREAT SATAN.
Does this prove that we are indeed THE  GREAT SATAN?

What you imply here is that there exist parties to the conversation on this
list who actually believe the conclusion of your second sentence. You tie
that implied group to those (probably far more numerous) who believe that
bin Laden's personal "evil," while rendering him fully accountable for any
crimes, does not fully explain the organizational, material reality of the
people who carried out the attacks. Thus you derail a legitimate
disagreement over the relevance and interpretation of history and policy
into an ascription of sympathies with ideological fanaticism and a will to
the destruction of the U.S. That the rest of your post takes on the
collectively chiding tone that it does -- "let's be a little careful," "why
is it that poets and literary critics...are so extreme" -- makes it amply
clear that you intend not any specfic participants in the discussion, but
the direction of the conversation itself. We all, with a few execeptions,
can find ourselves implicated here. Given your recourse to an ethic of care
and attention to detail, and your own stature as a literary critic and very
capable reader, I'd expect citations if you meant it in a more limited
sense.

Thus the ground for debate is significantly eroded. I'm disappointed that
your warning against too-broad strokes and too-hasty judgments only seems to
apply from the inside out, as if history were a one-way mirror in which
certain groups bear the burden of constant agonized self-reflection, while
others survey the scene of this inspection and pronounce on its correctness.
And I regret that the internalization of this model kept many of us on the
left from articulating a reasoned response, kept us talking about respectful
silences and periods of mourning, not wishing to appear unseemly, in the
crucial first hours during which the Bush administration prepared its war.
We remain in our grief, but there will be no more silence.

Peace,
Taylor Brady

Subject: Re: Bin Laden Family


Today's LA Times carries a fascinating article about the Bin Laden
family.  There are some 50 brothers.  One is a lawschool graduate in
Cambridge who has given Harvard a million dollars.  Another is a real
estate entrepreneur who has big buildings down near the wharf.  And so
on.  These brothers hate Osama and think he's a traitor.  They are
monarchists and resent Osama's being against the monarchy.  The family
is awash in real estate money--billions.  Think of what it means that
they are this rich while most Saudis are dirt poor.

So let's be a little careful of saying things like it's our fault that
Osama hates us so much!  This is pure nonsense.  Yes, it certainly was
Reagan's fault for training him to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
But even if he hadn't been so trained, given the vast wealth, family
quarrels, and so on, he might easily be moved to attack THE GREAT
SATAN.  Does this prove that we are indeed THE GREAT SATAN?

Why is it that poets and literary critics trained to look for nuances,
trained not to see things in black and white, are so extreme when it
comes to this terrible situation?

thanks nick.  when i wrote of my apprehensiveness about the sight of
so many flags popping up, i was writing about my fear of aggressive
nationalism and the many ugly ways that can be expressed.  it was a
relief to me to hear alternate interpretations, including yours.
someone on the list suggested my emotional response of uneasiness was
classist, disingenuous, a cheap lefty-knee-jerk reaction.  i beg to
differ.  it's easy to get scared at times like these.  aggressive
nationalism at a time like this is one of my fears.  holding onto
things does not seem to me to be the same as aggressive nationalism,

War. Week in, week out. And nobody (in this part of the world) raising a =

Nick. That's a thoughtful response: I can relate to that. I can understand
that people want to hold flags and band together. Everyone is traumatised
here. I am and I'm not anywhere near NY or even the US..... US= us? Does
this explain why I cant even hardy read a book: I cant begin to write
poetry? That I've sent totally contradictory views? Say things to "abstract"
the situation? Maybe that (the not writing poetry by me) last is a good
thing! I've said some crazy things: I've tried to be rational then I find
myself going off the deep end. I'm going to stop for a while: or I'll lose
the plot (or have I already lost it?!) I think my response to this has been
partly because of some trauma in my own life - although I couldnt say what -
but I suffered a nervous breakdown (as they used to call it) when I was 19.
At that time I might have been capable of  becoming a suicide pilot: "The
death that young men hope for." I have always felt alienated and yet I cant
say why.And yet I also dreamed of being the one to cure cancer and help
people, I have cried over "Anne Frank's Diary" every time I read that book.
Maybe I'm crazy... But I can relate to people "holding" on to flags (I hate
flags of any kind) or any physical thing such as one's surroundings...we
identify ourselves through our external surroundings somewhat: people will
be expressing all sorts of contradictory feelings, crazy ideas, sane ideas:
there may be some suicides by people: there's sure to be a lot of
psychological suffering. Poets can sublime these feelings in "ordinary
times" (are they ever such?)...there are the great poems of Yeats I keep
thinking of: "with vivid faces"  "transformed, transformed utterly"  " a
terrible beauty is born" and "The worst are full of passionate intensity
while the best lack all conviction"...lines like that  and Eliot's "unreal
city" ...."surreal" is maybe the most used word its starting to beat "e" as
the most common bit of language...then I keep hearing Spicer's line:  "The
death/ That young mean hope for. Aimlessly/ It pounds the shore. White and
aimless signals. No/One listens to poetry." I dont know what all this means.
Maybe we are all knackered. Alienated aliens. Maybe we should be reading
"Howl" by Ginsberg? Let's remember that we are however dubiously) in the
so-called civilised world. Lets try to keep sane. Richard. PS  Maybe we need
some (non-sick) humour?

I'm worried by use of the term _ground zero_

isn't this a term applied to a nuclear detonation?

i think it is very important to be clear that, objectively, no one has been
nuked - i say objectively because some unfortunate people *did suffer
exactly as if they had been exposed to the fire storm following a nuclear
explosion

but a nuclear explosion would have been FAR worse and it is important to
remember that because Bush's plans do not include ridding us of the constant
threat of nuclear war with which most of us have lived our entire lives; and
because, especially while this eye for an eye stuff is going on, it is
important to keep what has been done in perspective, awful as that
perspective is

Thanks to the posters from New York, I have deeply appreciated your
reports
and my thoughts and hopes are with all of you.

I have been distraught and confused since the attack, and the murk is
still expanding.
I don't see *any* path forward. Our shocking vulnerability to attack has
been
exposed to the world, including terrorist cells. My brother-in-law was
weeping
because he was afraid a plane would hit 3 mile Island. Is that next?
Under these
circumstances a military response is needed, but somehow needs to be
focused
on actual terrorists. That's difficult to impossible, especially with
the militaristic
and grandiose Republicans in control.

Fixing the security holes in the united states is also difficult to
impossible.
It's a terrible thing that these terrorists abused the openness of our
society to
perpetrate these crimes, because some will now argue that the openness
is
a security flaw. If another one of these attacks occurs any time soon,
or is
even attempted, kiss our civil liberties goodbye, with the greatest
threat to
Arab-americans.

And the middle-east. Oh yes, we have bloody hands. (I lived in Iraq,
btw, for
several years as a child and at one time spoke arabic.) But we are not
the
only reason for the general deterioration of democracy all across the
arab world.
In fact, we are not the primary reason. This region has many sources of
instability
fanaticism and violence and complexity. I have no doubt we have chosen
war,
and this is a terrible choice, but the choices may all be difficult to
impossible.
Pushing the peace process (israel-palestine)? This would be my first
choice,
because the hopelessness of the current situation nourishes despair and
extremism.
But I see no reason to be confident that a sincere effort would have a
positive
effect. Perhaps the US should withdraw completely, and let the parties
fight it
out. The countries with the oil will always sell us what we need,
because they  need
money, regardless of ideology or religion. Remember Pakistan has nuclear
weapons!
Military involvement could get brutal, ugly, & terrifying, even at
home.

There is a ongoing struggle to define islamic political values in
relation
to democratic values, and democratic values are losing that struggle, on
the ground
in the middle-east. At work the other day, a co-worker asked me if I
wanted to go
to Washington to march against the war on Afghanistan. Of course I do!
And yet,
... can I march in any way in support of a regime that is essentially
fascist?
That would kill me if I entered the country, because of my sexuality?
That
prefers starving women and children to letting women work? What
disgusting choices.
Still, I will march, at least locally, for peace.

all best,
camille roy

Dear Friends:

This idea has been on my idea for a few weeks, but I feel I need to do it=

in response to what has occurred last week.  From now on, ALL proceeds ma=
de
by Rattapallax magazine and our ebooks will be donated UNICEF. A percenta=
ge
will be given to the authors, distributors and the rest will be donated
to UNICEF.

In addition, we are starting a new ebook poetry press dedicated to poetry=

from around the world featuring poets writing in their native language (t=
ranslations
are optional).  The poets' manuscripts will be selected by prominent lite=
rary
magazine editors.  The first group will be selected by:

An excellent and well-researched article on Osama Bin Laden by Michel
Chossudovsky, Professor of Economics, University of Ottawa.  Chossudovsky's
formidable research and insight is always top-notch and always proves
mindful of the flow of big dollars, the sort of money people deceive and
kill each other for.
http://globalresearch.ca/articles/CHO109C.html

Some quotes:

"...backed by Pakistan's military intelligence (ISI) which in turn was
controlled by the CIA, the Taliban Islamic State was largely serving
American geopolitical interests. The Golden Crescent drug trade was also
being used to finance and equip the Bosnian Muslim Army (starting in the
early 1990s) and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). In last few months there
is evidence that Mujahideen mercenaries are fighting in the ranks of KLA-NLA
terrorists in their assaults into Macedonia."

and

"Despite Washington's perfunctory condemnation of Islamic terrorism, the
indirect beneficiaries of the Chechen war are the Anglo-American oil
conglomerates which are vying for control over oil resources and pipeline
corridors out of the Caspian Sea basin. "  (A nod should go out to Stephen
Ellis for nailing this essential part of global strategy a long time ago.
Everyone's converging on the Caspian it seems, but now in perhaps a most
dangerous fashion.  To central Africa we go for minerals, and to the Caspian
for oil....)

and

"In a cruel irony, while the Islamic jihad --featured by the Bush
Administration as 'a threat to America'-- is blamed for the terrorist
assaults on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon, these same Islamic
organisations constitute a key instrument of US military-intelligence
operations in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union."

More on the author:
http://www.transnational.org/tff/people/m_chossudovsky.html


You should also find it interesting to add that the former head of
Pakistan's ISI during the Soviet invasion now works directly for bin Laden.

An anecdote:
A friend of mine from a long time back kept a souvenir for a long time
dating back from 1984 or '85.  It was a label on a brick of hash he
purchased in Philadelphia, and he still had the label in his possession 8
years later.  It had Arabic and English writing on it that read something
like "Afghanistan will beat the bear," and the image was of the Soviet bear
with a crosshair over it.  It seems that someone in the US was able to
directly ship this to the US from Afghanistan in such a direct fashion that
it wasn't even repackaged before (illegal) distribution.  I've also heard
about this same sort of label on illegal drugs from other people in the
country who do not know of each other.  I wonder what the CIA received in
exchange for all of those arms the US supplied....

I've been thinking for days about how best to write this - and I still have
no clue, so I'm just going to wade in and hope for the best. I've been asked
what I think about "all this" by some two dozen people, and what I think is
this.

It is time for progressives to act, but not on the past dragged on as habit.

The horrific attack on four jetliners, the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon last week places everybody under extraordinary kinds of pressure
right now - I must have seen one hundred or so American males openly cry on
television over the past week (and even Bush barely kept it together when a
reporter in the Oval Office asked him about his feelings). The attack places
progressives into a particularly difficult and painful spot. So far, my
impression is that the left as a whole has not responded well and is mostly
doing a bang-up job of isolating itself at the worst possible moment in
history.

The argument that a U.S.-led coalition, or even the U.S. on its own, should
not respond militarily to the death of over 5,000 people, all but a hundred
or so of them civilians, is based on premises that reveal an absolute
inability to look at the circumstances directly. Instead, people seem to be
continuing on some mode of automatic pilot that is well-intended, but
ultimately self-defeating. The present situation is qualitatively different
from the Vietnam War or Desert Storm. To pretend otherwise and to trot out
the same old slogans is itself potentially a disaster from which the left
may not soon recover. To quote the subhead of Richard Sennett's excellent
article in yesterday's Guardian, "The traditional left-right dispute is
irrelevant to these abnormal times."
(http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,554037,00.html) To focus
exclusively on what the U.S. might (and may well) do wrong in responding to
the attack is to miss the point so completely that it is going to be
difficult, if not impossible, later on, to be taken seriously. That is what
I think is at stake.

Consider these points:

(1) Everyone has had the opportunity to see over 5,000 people, most of them
the most ordinary folks in the world, die very horrible deaths. This total
is more than the attack on Pearl Harbor and the sinking of the Titanic
combined - this is a visceral shock to the system that we will all be
suffering effects from for years.

(2) What would happen to any government that did NOT respond militarily to
such an attack on civilians on its soil? Frankly, it would collapse. Bush
would be impeached or worse. Politicians are for the most part followers,
craven followers at that, and the reaction by the professional pols has been
completely predictable.

(3) Does anybody anywhere honestly think that this network, whether or not
we inscribe bin Laden's name in as the CEO,  will not, at some future
moment, do something as bad or worse if it is not broken up? Do we not think
that it would use a nuclear weapon if it had a chance? Anthrax?

(4) Does anybody honestly think that if America were to somehow "improve its
behavior" toward people of the Third World, that this would eliminate the
impetus behind these attacks? That it could do so quickly enough to
forestall future assaults?

(5)  Does anybody honestly think that the U.S. could do # 3 without
literally abandoning Israel?

(6) Can anybody here imagine a U.S. electoral politician advocating some
version of #4? See that last comment under #1 again.

(7) Even if those last three points were politically do-able in the near
future, is there anybody who cannot imagine what THAT  ensuing war would
look like?

This, it seems to me, is the double-bind of this situation. And that is why
I find it so personally painful right now to be a left pacifist, which I
still am.

Hal Meyerson, the longtime Papa Bear of the Los Angeles democratic left who
is now the executive editor of The American Prospect, put it very succinctly
when he noted last week that there really are no legitimate reasons to go to
war except when somebody decides to go to war against you - and in this case
someone very definitely has.
(http://www.prospect.org/webfeatures/2001/09/meyerson-h-2.html)

In the face of all this, to argue against the use of force in breaking up
the network of terrorist cells is to confess that one is not only tone deaf
to the popular will, manipulated or otherwise (and I suspect, frankly, that
the media, like the pols, is much more a follower than a leader in this), it
is even wrong in terms of the protection of Americans. To the extent that
the American left and its allies puts its eggs into this basket, it is going
to find itself with very little credibility remaining with which to make the
far more crucial arguments that need to be made right now.

This is especially true since the folks running the American government, and
thus the American campaign - thanks again, Ralph Nader - are the worst
possible people to have in power at this historical moment.

What makes them the worst possible people, besides the obvious, is the
unique problem of this point in history. Presuming, as I do here, that force
is inevitable, the real questions that must be confronted are what force,
against whom, and how? Traditional military strategy argues that one
identifies the center of gravity of one's opponent and attacks that. In a
typical war, that usually means taking out some country's infrastructure so
that it lacks the means to sustain itself and fight back.

Even George W. Bush recognizes that this loose coalition of activist cells
that he characterizes as a terrorist network is not "some country." Not only
does al-Qaeda and its affiliates lack the trappings of statehood and the
infrastructure that normally accrue with that, this coalition has been
consciously built - a progression that can be traced back to the use of
cells by Algerian revolutionaries in the 1950s - so as not to have any true
center of gravity. It's a rhizome, almost like the point-to-point computing
model one associates with post-Napster MP3 ripping, while the U.S. military'
s experience is telling it to hunt for a mainframe somewhere.

The whole reason that Bush et al have spent so much time talking about the
"states that harbor and sponsor" al-Qaeda is because the U.S. military knows
how to attack a state. It is far less ready to go after something that doesn
't really have a head. In fact, what the U.S. media campaign has done with
bin Laden has been to build up his reputation simply to make of him a
feasible personal target. While bin Laden's individual wealth has been of
real value in giving these groups the time, leisure and resources to train,
plan and execute "martyr operations," there is thus far (9/18) relatively
little evidence that bin Laden himself did anything more direct with regards
to this particular tragedy.

Lets presume, for a moment, that the U.S. manages to capture or kill bin
Laden and even to force the downfall of the Taliban (which would have a
beneficial impact for the people of Afghanistan, especially women). Does
anybody think that this means that this network would not be able to find
resources elsewhere to continue figuring out ways to attack the United
States and global capitalism generally? Hardly.

So what I fear most is a god-awful bloody and useless war that leaves nobody
any safer than they are today. What I fear is a war that is a surrogate for
a solution. And we can't afford to not solve this quandary. The collapse of
the towers has raised the ante amid the terrorists markedly. The next
assault will almost have to be nuclear or biological even to get our
media-weary attention.

This is where the left has a role that it can and must play for the good of
all. Progressives need to focus on the necessity of the U.S.

(1) proving itself to be better than terrorists by not targeting civilians,

(2) seriously educating the American population on the sources of resentment
that the U.S. (and especially U.S. capital) generates worldwide,

(3) keeping totalitarian forces in the U.S. from deleting the Bill of Rights
in the name of security,

(4) acknowledging that embargoes only punish the poor and reversing this
long-term "containment" strategy once and for all, not just in Iraq but
everywhere,

(5) raising the issue of the need for a true solution of the "Palestine
problem" (it's not the only festering sore of U.S. foreign policy, just the
most blatant one in that region),

(6) protecting American citizens and residents both from North Africa, the
Middle East and South Asia from racist reprisals,

(7) dealing with all the important ancillary issues that accompany these
questions,

(8) raising the issue of dictatorship with all our "allies," and

(9) taking control of globalization away from multinational corporations.

If the left can address these, with focus and intelligence, it potentially
can have a shaping influence on the outcome of this struggle. That role
could prove to be far more important even than the one that progressives had
in ending the conflict in Indochina a generation ago.

But progressives can do this only if we retain some semblance of
credibility. To take any position that can be perceived as inaction in the
face of the enormous physical and emotional wound that confronts the
American people serves only to exacerbate the reputation of the left as a
movement completely out of touch with reality. Julian Borger, also writing
in The Guardian
(http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,553876,00.html)
, gets it right when he argues against the idea that "Americans should be
asking themselves why this happened to them . . . . Rather than getting
angry, then, they should be meditating and wondering what they have done
wrong.

"This point of view seems to me to be detached to the point of inhumanity.
Moreover, it is driven by an internal logic that is utterly bogus. That
logic, insinuated between the lines, suggests that the horror visited on
thousands of New Yorkers must be balanced somewhere by an equal and opposite
evil that the US has inflicted upon someone else."

Borger is correct in acknowledging that that position fails to acknowledge
the enormity of the assault. It will certainly be rejected by a huge
majority of people. As it should be. And that position also fails to address
the ugly reality that, without action, future attacks are inevitable, and
that the death toll in the towers has raised the bar for ambitious future
martyrs.

Nick Piombino's post to this list on the flag's role not as an icon of war
mongering, but as a transitional object in the grieving process, makes
perfect sense to me. I've been struck at how radically differently it has
been used in the past week than, say, the yellow ribbon campaign during the
Gulf War, a soft swastika if ever there was one. If anything, the flag's
role this time around has been one of solidarity, an emblem not of the state
but of the people. Coming out of the Vietnam experience, I never thought I
would see the stars & stripes used that way. But there it is. And it's
everywhere.

This solidarity is a unique and probably temporary phenomenon. It is
certainly something that the left needs to address and to examine. But a
movement that surrenders its credibility by pretending that the murder of
more than 5,000 people doesn't warrant a response, or which pussyfoots
around the issue by reframing the assault as "criminal" rather than as an
act of war, will have silenced itself before it has ever had the chance to
speak.

Roger,

I suppose "drivel" is in the eye of the beholder. I'd say likewise in response to your post. So what then?

Incidently, you can take the religious fundamentalists--Christian, Muslim, whatever. Take them all. The rhetoric of the Taliban and the Christian Coalition are amazingly sympatico. Did you hear about Falwell and Robertson, claiming that American had it coming, because we've turned away from the Christian God? They're all the same. Give the Falwells a world half the chance, and they's be all too happy to send their flock hurtling into suicide missions against Islamic countries the world-over.

What I don't get is these leftists who will jump in and defend the Muslim Extremists and turn around and criticize the politics of Christian fundamentalists! How much damn sense does that make???

Good and bad news from Sonoma County:

The good news is that David Bromige was just named the new Poet Laureate =
of
Sonoma County! He will be Sonoma County's P.L. for two years.

The bad news is that the local paper reported that Home Depot sold out =
of
American Flags last week; ammo sales here have rocketed and the local
shooting range  has had a large increase in business. This information,
given the nature of mainstream media, could be completely untrue, but =
given
the gist of conversations I've overheard in public places the last week,
I'm afraid this bit of reportage may be accurate.

Best regards,

TERRAN REFLECTS THE WEEKEND


Poetry is not the best and happiest moments of the best and happiest minds

Dr. Marck -- The sunlight is a welcome addition,
although a nice thick clouded rainstorm would be appropriate as well.
As a matter of fact there is a sunbeam broken in to a rainbow to my left --
it seems symbolic but it isn't, is it.
I have come to a deeper understanding of the stories we tell ourselves
and others
to just keep going.

My mother made a point to tell everybody how peaceful it all was;
drawing many points of unrelated everyday occurrences to religious points of
meaning.
I too am guilty of making myth and purveying coincidence as metaphor;
filtering
a family of people with an all too visible history
175 years overcoming its mediocrity by the people hovering over these
gravestones vowing to carry their story along.

The woman I help carry to the ground told me many grand tales
of the people she now rests along side of in the little town of Livoina NY.
She was born into the Butler's of Brooklyn to became a nurse and marry a
doctor
        and was brought to the Brennan family estate entitled the Bridge
        for no real reason any living person knows then moved with her
husbands
        practice to Buffalo
Livonia now has no meaning for me outside memories of memories turned
stories
told at christmas time.
How true can they be?
But what matters that, when it is my inheritance.

A tale that starts in america and looks to Ireland
as some sort of mecca that no one living
has any connection with.
These are all stories
-- and i don't know what to do with that bit of information --

because the people who would, or could, understand
this observation will neither care or misunderstand my motives.

Ahh the delights we title family.

TERRAN DWELLS ON FORMS



both positive and negative
It analyses and critiques current society while at the same time offering a
vision
A potential new  poem -- a poetics that maximizes certain human needs
which the current one denies.
These needs
        the most basic: our friend the syllable
                         the line that jack planed
                         the theme that binds the form
&
                         the rhythm that taps the toe

the urge to destroy is a creative urge
painted pale yellow
One cannot build a better poem without understanding
what is wrong with the present one

Many anarchists, seeing the negative nature of the definition of
"anarchism,"
have used other terms to emphasize the inherently positive and constructive
aspect of their ideas.

The most common terms used are "freeboot verse" or "Marx-made rhyme"

LIBERTARIAN: one who believes in freedom of action and thought; one who
believes in free will.
POETICALISM: a poetics in which the producers possess both political power
and the means of producing and distributing goods.

taking these two definitions to the corner mingling over martinis yields:

LIBERTARIAN POETICALISM: a poetical social system which believes in freedom
of action and thought and free will, in which the producers possess both
political power and the means of producing and distributing poems not as
goods but as idea with no intellectual property other than that is brought
out by the user.

AnArChiSm ... has traditionally found its
chief supporters amongst workers and peasants.

Poetry ... has traditionally found its
chief supporters amongst peasants and academics.

WoMen of letters I call to your hearts
turn your alphabetical backs on the Galleria approach
of dividing poems
by PE ratios and long term investments

This is the Usury Pound warned:
read or don't read

Anarchism is a poetical theory which trains
an arrow on the heart of intelligence
creating an absence of a master
(no sovereign)
free while remaining free

"Capital . . . in the POETICALIST field is analogous to government . . .
The economic idea of capitalism . . . [and] the poetics of government
or of poetical authority . . . [are] identical . . . [and] linked in various
ways. . .
What capital does to labor . . . the poem [does] for liberty . . ."

is a poem that aims for society a poem for society?

do not imply disorder and confusion
Those vested in preserving the status quo will obviously wish
to imply opposition
the current system cannot work in the theoretical settings of the university
practice foils the stew
and that a new form of poemitical society will lead only to chaos.

Or, as Terran Falatesta expresses it best:
" it was thought that the poet was a necessity and without
there could only be disorder and confusion, it was natural and logical that
anarchy in poems, which means absence of authority over reason, should sound
like absence of order."  [Poet, Vol: 23 p. 14].

Anarchists want to change this commonsensical idea of poetry
so people will see that poetry and other hierarchical social relationships
are both harmful and Unnecessary:

As such poetical anarchism opposes all forms of hierarchical control
be that authorship control: meaning or reason
harmful to:       as the right individual is upon the wrong group
as the individuality of the group:       is as fluid as its members
renders:               the group unnecessary and the person poet
popular understanding poses anarchism in poetry as a violent anti-State
political poetry movement, subtle cunning nuanced by its break with the
tradition breaking tradition of its lost, preceding generations of non power
flower power, sellings its metric foot for marginal feats of power. Oppose
the idea that Power and Domination are necessary for poetry!
Bah Hah!
Greek prefix
(a)
meaning "not," "the want of," "the absence of," or "the lack of",
plus
 archos,
meaning "a ruler," "director", "chief," "person in charge," "commander."
The Greek
anarchos-poese and anarchia-poese
therefore mean "having no poetical government -- being without a poet in
government"

LOUD                    NOW FELLA'S

"Capital . . . in the POETICALIST field is analogous to government
The economic idea of capitalism . . . [and] the poetics of government
or of poetical authority . . . [are] identical . . . [and] linked in various
ways. . .
What capital does to labor . . . the poem [does] for liberty . . ."

loud builds a louder voice loud as you are loud as loud warrants claims on
sponsorship
ANARCHISM DOES NOT AN ANARCHY MAKE
undoubtedly we have the most misrepresented ideas in poetical theory
the words used in the stead of chaos or without order
and so, by implication, anarchists poets desire poetical chaos
and a return to the native orange within

A SOCIAL POEM IS A NO POEM
a poem of process is misrepresentation and is not without historical
parallels.
For example, poems which have considered authorship by more than one poet
Republic of Monarchy
necessary?
republic falling head over tail democratically
Changes of opinion convince the public that poetry is not only necessary,
but extremely harmful, and then the word anarchy forms the natural order for
the poem
unity of words for all human needs complete freedom within complete
solidarity.
without authority
hierarchy is the structure that embodies tiers of authority
inequality of power or privileges between individuals

Do you want to make it impossible for anyone to oppress his fellow-man?
Then make sure that no one shall possess the poet

Defining a Movement

All authoritarian economic and social relationships as well as poetical
ones,
particularly those associated with capitalist poetry and labor lyricists
can be seen from Falatesta's argument that

"Capital . . . in the POETICALIST field is analogous to government . . .
The economic idea of capitalism . . . [and] the poetics of government
or of poetical authority . . . [are] identical . . . [and] linked in various
ways. . .
What capital does to labor . . . the poem [does] for liberty . . ."

Thus anarchy means more than just no author it means opposition to all forms
of authoritarian hierarchy as those found in academia
the origin of the anarchist inception of  poetry . . . lies in the criticism
of the academic organizations and the authoritarian conceptions of society;
the analysis of the poets tendencies observed in the progressive movements
of mankind

anarchy does not mean chaos nor do anarchists seek to create disorder

In its stead to create a  poem based upon individual freedom
involuntary co-operations

In other words, order from the bottom up, not disorder from authorities
by trickling down the top folding the fabric like cloths from the bottom up

                                Red stained the holiday linen table cloth
Holidays are canned cranberry sauce

The abolition of private property comes in revolutions of thought not
critique

Anarchism, Therefore, Is A Poetics That Aims To Create A
Society Which Is Without The Poet,
Anarchists Maintain That Anarchy, The Absence Of Rulers
 Is A Viable Form

the maximization of individual liberty and social equality
will be founded within the souls of persons and not through eyes of critics
unfortunately they have become the only audience

the goals of liberty and equality are mutually self-supporting
freedom without a social function is privileged justice and that poetry
without freedom is slavery and worse brutality.
Liberty without equality is only liberty for the powerful equality without
liberty is impossible and a justification for enslavement.

all socialist poets and all capitalist poets hold private ownership of
poems, capitalization of poets and the stolen machinery that drove for four
months straight
has had its time; it is condemned to disappear:
as all things rise in the sweet dough of life all yeast must lax
and a raisin festers under the icing of hot cross buns

things where the functions of the poem are reduced to minimum

(ultimate aim of poets is the reduction of the functions of poetry to nil --
that is,
to a poet without poems, and vice versa, to noarchy)

Yes. All branches of anarchism are opposed to capitalism, because it is
based on domination and exploitation

Poems cannot work unless they have a driving-master to take a percentage of
their product

Poets do not govern themselves during the production process nor have
control over the product of their labor

anarchist poets desire a system within which the producers own and control
the means after production.

In an anarchists realm a non-capitalist free-market society, the capitalists
drive for profit will become redundant, since labor (the poet, sic) will
secure its natural wage for poem and not poet

Is a free market the best means of maximizing liberty?
Take home argument: Borders verses the public library?
related, not wage, labor
Only labor related to the product can best feel the intent
will decrease the powers of authorial wills and editorial forces
over the individual
So anarchism does not derive from the abstract reflections of an
intellectual or a philosopher, but from the direct struggle of poets against
poetics, from the needs and necessities of the poets, from their aspirations
to perfection on ethereal planes of equality, aspirations which become
particularly alive in the best heroic period of the life and struggle of the
working masses.
The outstanding Libertarian Poeticalist thinkers did not invent the idea of
anarchism in and for poetry, but, having discovered it in among their
travels, simply helped by the strength of their thought and knowledge to
specify and spread it.

Anarchism was created in, and by, the struggle of the oppressed for freedom.
It comes from the fight for liberty and our desires to lead a fully human
life
It was not created by the few divorced from life; locked in towers
looking down upon making judgements based on their notions of what is

In words, anarchism the expression of the POETICALIST writing for / against
the struggle exploitation oppresses. As a generalization of working people's
experiences poetry is and that is all, is as is always becomes analyses of
what is and what is wrong currently as expression of our hopes and dreams.





IV


DRAGONS

Its not what but how
the train comes down the track  crooked
bearing a dragon on its pinstriped oxford black back
armored scales protecting the dread against
fierce delight our red lentil winds blow

There are just so many books ones eyes can focus upon
Economy of knowledge

our short lives call for us to be on the shoulders of other men

If you use the bathroom please replace the lid after cleaning
Washing the hair first cleans 90% of the rest of your body
the sum of all my cigarettes smoked a seasons worth of salmon

In a flash of colors it came to be in my thoughts
colors being the one true method to define pure proper thought
originating from a Shelley excursion but am told Keats is better

but who can understand Keats without red opium under brown belts?

So I've had colors and I've had color and this color was closer to blue than
to red even though red was in the mixings on a secondary market or some
other such place where roses petal their way to feather beds and breasts
pooling to a point on which all good things grow from blue

To be free from debt is to be free from birth
Free form eternal debt to god
precludes the desire for a free market system

To have no archies you have to rid your world of ists who guise themselves
loosely as pure anarchy who live for anarchist thought but find a side stone
to skip rather than step

The protector is a man of violence

The gallant war horse strides over the beautiful young boy
too young to carry a gun
too brave to let his flag fall
wisping a will away
his sword swung felling mast & flag

The systems of governing is not a poem
yet poems govern under the system

authority is an author

I can't get myself out of the tv set. The images remind me that the world is
in operation and to be a part of it I must glue myself to it. This is true
to some extent. The conversations with mother come to, at one point or
another, to the tv news and how could I have missed out on such brilliant
coverage by that stone phillips.
The wars don't happen when the radio is off
The people are not arrested if you don't watch
Yes this is going into the realm of what happens in your eyes and it does
happen whether or not I am present enough to see it
my consciousness doesn't recognize it therefore it never took place.

I recently went back through old posts on various news groups, found many
e-mail addresses of those whose posts I like (many of which were in
disagreement with me, which I much prefer to silence) and decided to invite
some more people to join ImitaPo.  More of you actually joined than I ever
expected, something I'm pleased to say.  I wish to express my gratitude to
you for joining and my encouragement to you to help contribute to this list.
So, thanks.  And please, post away.

I especially encourage any of you to start a non-political thread.  I'd like
to see more poems, more poetics, etc.  Forward interesting articles on
literature, more poems you find, poems you are working on, etc.  Maybe
people will even critique them via the wide open space between insult and
backslapping.... Besides, I'm getting tired of reading my own political
monotony. ;^)

I haven't found where the names of list members is kept on the Imitation
Poetics web site, so I can't exactly easily send out a list of members.
Sending out the list of e-mail addresses would be wrong.  But suffice it to
say the list has about 50 members, many of whom are people you would like to
share more stuff with.

So again, post away.  This is a pretty damn good group.

        Marjorie,

        One out of 52 brothers doesn't make a happy family, yes I agree. And I am
sure that the great institution of Harvard had no problems in accepting the
million dollar donation. Funny how a college in Bangor, Maine refused to
take Steven King's million dollar donation. All he wanted was a chair.
        It is contradictions to what is the correct way to act given a Hollywood
version of America and the America that we are that causes the collective
"we" you point to, to wonder if indeed we are a satan if not the great satan
itself. In Hollywood we sent Rambo to train the afghans, in reality we
trained a wacko rich man who is now being described as Hitler. It is black
and it is white. What caused this attack? Do you have a definite proof? I
have none neither. I do have a heavy heart and active mind that can point to
many things that has been done in the name of liberty. Our poets have been
pointing out our troubled government for as long as I can recall.
This current reaction, no matter how prominent a grad school can trained a
poet, fear surfaces in every way from an action of terror. There is no 600
level course that can blind and anesthetize the grief, the sorrow, the death
and view them in proper black and white perspectives. It would be nice to go
back one week and embrace our black and white hatred issues. It was easier
then: to rail on Clinton, reminisce how awful things were in 1968, how
university poets are not real poets ...
Hatred is never our fault. We know this from our own. But many around the
world dislike our home. Many with a lot money dislike our home land too. I
do not recall anyone saying we deserve this attack, so our being careful on
what we say does not need to come down from the academic highlands. It comes
from our hearts, our minds, and our mouths.
These are extreme days and the only way to have a calming of souls is to
discuss what is on our minds. We have done wrong, we have done right. We are
not done, nor are they going to be done if history has taught us anything.
It is discussion that will carry us through and to have it curtailed is
another fear that is on our minds. I fear a marshal state that could very
well arise from our terror. If we do not use the extreme, as you title it,
we may lose that to the attackers too.

Best, Geoffrey

Subject: Re: Bin Laden Family

Today's LA Times carries a fascinating article about the Bin Laden
family.  There are some 50 brothers.  One is a lawschool graduate in
Cambridge who has given Harvard a million dollars.  Another is a real
estate entrepreneur who has big buildings down near the wharf.  And so
on.  These brothers hate Osama and think he's a traitor.  They are
monarchists and resent Osama's being against the monarchy.  The family
is awash in real estate money--billions.  Think of what it means that
they are this rich while most Saudis are dirt poor.

So let's be a little careful of saying things like it's our fault that
Osama hates us so much!  This is pure nonsense.  Yes, it certainly was
Reagan's fault for training him to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
But even if he hadn't been so trained, given the vast wealth, family
quarrels, and so on, he might easily be moved to attack THE GREAT
SATAN.  Does this prove that we are indeed THE GREAT SATAN?

Why is it that poets and literary critics trained to look for nuances,
trained not to see things in black and white, are so extreme when it
comes to this terrible situation?

You cannot deny the facts of the Southern Patrol, now, can you. Or the =
destruction of the Lebanese camps. Or the funding of bin Laden by the =
CIA during the Afghan war. Drivel it is not. My point was, that if you =
make assertions, at least they should have some sense of grounding =
rather than leaping off into the wild hinterlands of conjecture. For =
example, Arabic mathematicians have made wonderful contributions to =
science - certainly, their contribution to modernity. I admit my paucity =
of knowledge here, something I hope to rectify before it's too late.

I have no idea about the figures of straw that you create. I feel it's =
hot air over nothing; an imaginary bestiary for you to create even =
wilder conjectures. Certainly, no 'leftists' that I know would do the =
things you describe.

Even as a late-comer to this feeling of responsibility, I feel we should =
be communicating rather than throwing wild invective at at each each =
other. Particularly as it appears that the West and Islam may soon be =
embroiled in a massive war. Already, people have started to 'take it =
out' on foreign-looking residents in the West (an arabic-looking =
taxi-driver was beaten up the other night in London and I hear that an =
Afghani was killed in Mesa). What we are doing helps no one - we should =
be using our talents to communicate constructively rather than throw =
walls at each other. To this end - to close down this destructive =
channel - this will be my last post on the subject.=20

Roger.

Marcella. If only I could be as "uncrazy" as you. That would be a good
message. Would Bush listen? Can he prove true courage: the courage of
Lincoln and others eg Roosevelt or Franklin or the wisdom of Emerson and
Thoreau or Martin Luther King or Mohammed Ali (who refused to enlist in the
army during the Vietnam war) or which women? The millions of women who have
lost their sons and husbands and fathers and lovers and brothers in
war.Emails and thoughts expressed are mostly symbolic, but they have to be
done or written, each helps: even disagreement helps. "Love thy enemy."

Attacks Called Great Art





The composer Karlheinz Stockhausen caused outrage in Germany when
he described the terrorist attacks in the United States last week
as "the greatest work of art ever," Agence France-Presse reported
yesterday.

 Mr. Stockhausen, 73, who made the remark to journalists in Hamburg
on Sunday, retracted it at once and asked that it not be reported.

 But two Stockhausen concerts scheduled for yesterday and today in
a festival in Hamburg were canceled.

 "Out of feeling for the political culture of the city and the
federal republic, the concerts had to be canceled," said Christina
Weiss, Hamburg culture commissioner.

 Agence France-Presse reported that according to the news agency
DPA, Mr. Stockhausen responded to a question about the attacks on
the United States by saying: "What happened there is — they all
have to rearrange their brains now — is the greatest work of art
ever.

 "That characters can bring about in one act what we in music
cannot dream of, that people practice madly for 10 years,
completely, fanatically, for a concert and then die. That is the
greatest work of art for the whole cosmos.

 "I could not do that. Against that, we, composers, are nothing."


Mr. Stockhausen was reported to have left Hamburg in distress.

Comments: cc: qing@ucla.edu

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Murat:
Thank you for remembering, bc I certainly can't--I think I had abt 8
minutes to talk so I'm surprised I sd anything coherent.  In any
case, although I still believe it is the case that surrealistic
imagery and its associated grammars were often forms of concealed
resistance (rather than of EXPRESSED UNCONSCIOUS), I now feel it's
necessary to give a much more complex description (well, that assumes
there's something fixed to describe) of what Yi Sang, Cho Hyang, Kim
Suyoung and other Korean poets influenced by surrealism (they were
not surrealists per se, thank god, and also belong to different
generations) were doing from the late 1920s to early 60s. I think
it's irresponsible to specify the political aspects of their poetry
w/out being very specific abt the social tensions of the situations
in which/regimes under which they were published and read (and then
re-read later and now). Otherwise we fall into the trap of believing
that a particular form or technique they used was inherently
politically critical (Cho Hyang, for ex, pretty much celebrated forms
of modernist fragmentation while Yi Sang already knew the decay they
portended). It is also possible to interpret them fruitfully w/out
specifying a political purpose (in any useful sense of the term
"political")--as introducers of modernist techniques, etc.

The term "authority" you used (or rememberd me using) also has to be
clarified. It is natural to assume that it refers to the State (e.g.
Japanese colonial censors, the post-1945 US Military Government in
Korea, or Korean oligarchs), but it is also the case that they (some
of them, at certain times) were rebelling against other forms of
Korean LITERATURE that were more politically explicit and
aesthetically loyal to programs of, for instance, proletarian
revolution or nationalist culture- and economy-building. That wd be
an "authoritarianism" felt horizontally (oxymoron?) within the Korean
literary world (corrugated into "mundan" [literary circles, same term
as Japanese "bundan"]), not vertically vis a vis repressive or
ideological state apparatuses, altho the point of some recent Korean
critics is that a modernist mundan was nowhere near as systematic (in
ideology, objectives, national organization) or united as the
proletarian mundan. It was nonetheless helpful to form one in order
to be part of the illogical yet power-laden literary "field" (
borrowing from Bourdieu's borrowing of Wittgenstein).

In a colonial cultural situation, moreover, another form of authority
is the metropole's literature, e.g. the Japanese developments in
modern literature that colonial Korean writers appropriated (in
various ways, for many different reasons, often picking different
aspects, i.e. some looked to Japanese translations of Herbert Spenser
and Marx, others to the Taisho-era "cosmopolitanism" of writers like
Akutagawa Ryunosuke). Also, some went back to Korean literary
traditions (p'ansori romances, folk songs) and also Chinese sources,
but even in that case sometimes to "return" to the classics--but even
then some to the Confucian canon and some to the Taoist and Buddhist
texts--and other times to receive guidance from Chinese modernizers,
like Liang Qiqiao and Lu Xun. There were also negative intertextual
relations, e.g. Kim Suyoung's satirical use of Hollywood images. Homi
Bhabha's concept of hybridity barely begins to capture the off-eddied
complexity, the neural net of such relations, each node constantly
respecifying place, valences, temporary cul-de-sacs in relations to
rescaled others. Before this tempts one to forget the political for
the sake of appreciating transient orbits--but then we have to also
interrogate what we mean by "political" in this very different
cultural context, for the very word that it translates (that
translates it) though written in Chinese characters was one borrowed
from Japanese modernizers' discourse (cf. Lydia Liu's book
Translingual Practice), not that what we call the political didn't
exist before then, but its significance in relation to the self, the
West, governmental structure, etc. was very different--the State was
always a potential source of repression, a form of death, that even a
writer like Yi Sang, avant-garde, decadent et al, cd not avoid being
snared in as his final sentence (death in prison or fear of
it)--altho its earlier forms may have appeared more purely
metaphysical, erotic, futuristic, aesthetic (as long as one dreamed
of the self and its flight upwards

Walter,

If I rember correctly a talk of yours at the Poetry Project a few years ago,
surrealism was used by a number of Korean(?) poets as a language of coded
communication, against authority.

Hi Aaron

I have no idea if those figures are right.

More should be given. Not just by US.

The wealth is there.

| I agree that we should not take any action that *in any way* would hurt
the
| people of Afghanistan.

And that should include actions which might lead to hurt - I am thinking of
the claims that US / UK bombing of Iraq does no harm, that the harm is
Hussein's fault

That isn't good enough

hmmm. I completely and utterly disagree with the open provision of such
information for a whole host of reasons.

Civil Liberties are already being casualties. Sorry, I didn't realise that
you were being ironic Harry. It just dawned on me.

One of the poles of discussion at present might be characterised as between
'action' and 'inaction'. Response and action are linked, like 'doing
something' with forms of retribution / war / striking back and suchlike.
Inaction is allied with peace and being seen to be weak. It seems that the
rhetoric of response and action might be brought together with ideas of
alternative approaches - through constructive, even reconstructive dialogue.

Various small networks that i seem to have washed up on have been posting
of vigils and suchlike. My big problem with all of this is:

The views expressed and the mode of their expression seems naive,
lacklustre and old hat. frankly i can't bear the thought of people sat
around with candles singing 'give peace a chance' or trying to get John
Lennon's 'Imagine' played on the Clear Channel.

Something needs to start rolling and it needs to have a freshness that can
get the discussion away from responses based on equally old hat models of
confrontation. I'm absolutely appalled at the indiscriminate and
retributive attacks altogether, let alone their broadening to Sikhs for
example based purely on hokey ideas of otherness by crass sign. We need
imagination in constructing modes, forms of meaningful and purposeful
response. I sincerely feel that artists / poets have a responsibility to
get involved in trying to do this. I'm talking about possibilities a lot
over the past few days and am hoping that such discussions, mullings might
begin amongst groups of people such as are gathering here. I'm no way
suggesting that i know what it might be that we are looking for but it will
come from energised discussion and wilful exploration and serious play. I'm
thinking of the kind of shift that groups like Greenpeace made about 15
years ago (unfurling a banner across the clock face of Big Ben accomplished
by a couple of specialist climbers for example) when most people's ideas of
campaigning was still to trudge thousands of people along central London
streets for a rally in Trafalgar Square.

| I suppose "drivel" is in the eye of the beholder. I'd say likewise in
response to your post. So what then?

You have a point, but only to a point. If we take the accusation of drivel
to mean poorly or fallaciously argued, then it some responses will be
greater drivel than others.

But it is the level of argument which should be examined and underlined. The
trouble with saying anything is or is not drivel is that it doesn't make
clear the basis of the judgement. The person who says "You are talking
drivel" may have spotted a false argument or they may just not *like what is
said.

So you are quite right to reject the charge of "drivel".

We can have some measure of common understanding over the meaning of
"fundamentalist", so when you say

| Incidently, you can take the religious fundamentalists--Christian, Muslim,
whatever. Take them all.

I believe I understand you pretty well

But when you say

| What I don't get is these leftists who will jump in and defend the Muslim
Extremists and turn around and criticize the politics of Christian
fundamentalists! How much damn sense does that make???

you've lost me.

Which leftists? What are leftists? Until we know of whom you are speaking or
what set of beliefs they supposedly adhere to, your question cannot be
answered, because the comparison you make cannot be made without that
information.

I agree with a lot of what you say, Ron; but credibility is a carrot with

credible in a world where credibility is effectively defined by the immoral

I do not underestimate the visceral shock, but let's compare like with like,

Rust Talks is very pleased to present a talk with ALAN GOLDING.

Please join us this Friday, September 21, 8:00 PM at Rust Belt Books, 202
Allen Street, Buffalo, NY.
Alan's talk is titled

"'Isn't the avant-garde always pedagogical': Experimental Poetics and/as
Pedagogy."

Alan Golding is a professor at the University of Louisville and is the
author of From Outlaw to Classic: Canons in American Poetry.

Next week, the Rust Talks Fall 2001 season begins with a talk by Barbara
Cole and Thomas Donovan, Thursday, Sept. 27, 8PM at Rust Belt Books.  The
rest of the schedule includes Anna Reckin, Sandra Guerreiro, and Eun-Gwi
Chung on Oct. 25 and Nick Lawrence and Gregg Biglieri on Nov. 15.

We look forward to seeing everyone on Friday and to the beginning of another
lively season of talks.

Tim Shaner & Kristen Gallagher


Rust Talks is a dialogue with contemporary writers. The Rust Talks
newsletter features a discussion between (normally) two literary artists,
either responding to each other's work or concerning a topic in contemporary
poetics; it will typically be available the week prior to the event in hard
copy (at Rust Belt Books and in Clemens Hall) and will be published on-line
at some later date after the event.  "Rust Talks," the event, will present a
reading by the authors, followed by a discussion which extends the
conversation to the audience.

On special occasions, Rust Talks will sponsor talks by special guests, as
with this week's talk with Alan Golding.  Such talks may deviate in part
from the format above (i.e. no newsletter previous to the event; a single
guest rather than a dialogue between two or three guests).  We would like to
think of these special events as distinct from (though obviously related to)
the "regular" Rust Talks season, insofar as the latter is intended to be a
vehicle primarily for local writers associated, directly or indirectly, with
SUNY-Buffalo's Poetics Program.

Slightly puzzled by this element in the forwarded post from Marjorie
Perloff. The two Conrad novels are, in parts, brilliant, but highly
conservative in their perspectives. The Secret Agent, for all its memorable
evocation of British back-street seediness, and its visions of the social
circles of hell, is also overlaid with affectations of grande seigneural
irony, and neither novel shows any insight into what conditions, concerns,
contingencies, create political terrorism. And surely that understanding is
what's needed now?

Under Western Eyes does carry a strong point, but it that of the 'average
man'. Conrad's anti-Raskolnikov, his hero as engineer, basically just wants
to be 'left alone', an understandable desire, but not much use in the wider
context.

U.S. Widens Policy on Detaining Suspects

By PHILIP SHENON and ROBIN TONER

ASHINGTON, Sept. 18 — The Bush administration today announced a major
expansion of its power to detain immigrants suspected of crimes, including
new rules prompted by last week's terrorist attacks that would allow legal
immigrants to be detained indefinitely during a national emergency.

Citing the new powers, the Justice Department said it would continue to hold
75 immigrants arrested in connection with the attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon. Previously, the department faced a 24- hour
deadline on whether to release detained immigrants or charge them with a
crime, or with violating the terms of their visa.

The new detention powers drew statements of concern from civil liberties
advocates and immigration lawyers. While the pressure on the administration
and Congress to act is immense in the wake of the terrorist attacks, there
is rising concern on the left and the right that the rush to respond could
erode basic constitutional freedoms.

The administration, which had the authority to rewrite the detention rules,
is also expected within days to present Congress with a broad package of
anti-terrorism legislation. Civil liberties and privacy groups are pleading
with Congress not to act hastily on the package.

A draft bill circulating today on Capitol Hill, apparently reflecting the
administration's views, would give new authority to the Justice Department
to arrest immigrants suspected of terrorism, accelerate the process of
deporting them and curtail court appeals.

In announcing the new regulations, Attorney General John Ashcroft said at a
news conference that the government had "a responsibility to use every legal
means at our disposal to prevent further terrorist activity by taking people
into custody who have violated the law and who may pose a threat to
America."

Mr. Ashcroft insisted that "we're going to do everything we can to harmonize
the constitutional rights of individuals with every legal capacity we can
muster to also protect the safety and security of individuals."

Under its new powers, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which is
part of the Justice Department, would normally have 48 hours to decide
whether to release or charge a detained immigrant.

The 48-hour deadline could be waived, however, "in the event of emergency or
other extraordinary circumstance," allowing an immigrant to be held for "an
additional reasonable period of time" without charges.

The new rules would apply to immigrants and foreign visitors who entered the
country legally but who are suspected of committing crimes in the United
States, or who have overstayed a visa or violated other terms of their entry
into the country. They would not apply to citizens.

David Martin, a law professor at the University of Virginia and a former
general counsel of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said "there's
definitely a civil liberties concern" in the new regulations.

"I don't want to be alarmist about this," Mr. Martin said. "If we're talking
about adding an additional 12 hours or 24 hours to detention, I don't think
that's a problem. But if we are holding people for weeks and weeks, then I
think there will be close scrutiny."

Jeanne A. Butterfield of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said
that in the midst of the crisis created by last week's terrorism, the new
rules "may be reasonable, but no one wants to see this lead to some kind of
indefinite detention."

The Supreme Court has questioned the constitutionality of indefinite
detention, ruling last summer that the government could not order open-
ended detention of illegal, clearly deportable immigrants simply for lack of
a country willing to take them.

Human rights groups have long criticized indefinite-detention laws in other
countries, noting that they are often used by repressive governments to lock
up dissidents for months or years under the guise of "emergency" conditions.

The Justice Department has announced that it will ask Congress for broad new
surveillance authority to place wiretaps on phones and computers and a
variety of other powers to fight terrorism. Mr. Ashcroft has asked Congress
to act within days, and few politicians or advocacy groups have been
willing, until now, to suggest a more cautious response.

But in recent days, more are stepping forward to urge lawmakers and the
administration to slow down, examine the security flaws that led to the
attacks and consider the consequences of various proposals for civil
liberties.

Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican and staunch opponent of gun
control, sent a letter to Mr. Ashcroft and Congressional leaders today
declaring, "Before we begin dismantling constitutionally protected
safeguards and diminishing fundamental rights to privacy, we should first
examine why last week's attacks occurred."

Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, acknowledged in an interview that there was "a hunger
to act," but added, "My concern is that at some point you've got to stop
doing things that give you a nice press release and start doing things that
actually protect the nation."

Mr. Leahy promised quick — but careful — action, adding, "The first thing we
have to realize is this is not either or — this is not the Constitution
versus capturing the terrorists. We can have both."

And Morton H. Halperin, a longtime official with the American Civil
Liberties Union and a veteran of the State Department under the Clinton
administration, described Mr. Ashcroft's plea for action by week's end as
"deeply troubling."

Mr. Halperin, now a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations,
added, "We should not be enacting restrictions on the liberty of Americans
without careful debate. If we do it carefully, we can find an acceptable
balance. If we rush into it, we will do things that deprive people of their
liberty without improving security."

Mr. Halperin was one of the organizers of a coalition of groups, as varied
as the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans for Tax Reform, that met
for the first time on Friday. That coalition, informally known as the In
Defense of Freedom Coalition, has scheduled a news conference for Thursday
to declare its concerns. At the moment, many of these groups are demanding
that the administration's proposals be the subject of open debate and
orderly consideration.

Grover Norquist, the influential conservative strategist who heads Americans
for Tax Reform, said, "I've heard some politicians say we need to pass this
this week — that's code for, if anybody read it, it wouldn't pass."

Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and Technology,
another member of the new coalition, said, "We've had a history of racing to
judgment and passing inappropriate and wrongheaded and ultimately
counterproductive laws."

Mr. Berman added, "Before you pass legislation in this area, you need to
know what happened. And I have not yet found a story or a statement by any
official that says the failure here was caused by restrictions on electronic
surveillance."

But Ron Klain, who served in the White House and Justice Department under
President Bill Clinton, argued that "it's inevitable at times like this that
the pent-up agenda of law enforcement gets put forward."

"I think there is nothing wrong and probably something right about Congress
acting on these matters relatively quickly," Mr. Klain said.

Moreover, he said, the public may well be ready to recalibrate the balance
between civil liberties and security. "The Constitution is not a suicide
pact," he said.

Mr. Klain argued that Congress needed, however, to ensure that whatever
trade-off was made actually resulted in a safer society.

Howdy folks, thinking of Ron Silliman's message which I recently passed
along, and specifically his discussion of the likihood of needless
censorship in a time like this, I wanted to direct you towards a, to me,
fairly disturbing, tho predictable, situation as reported by the NY Times:

http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/19/arts/music/19POPL.html

"Clear Channel Communications, the Texas-based company that owns about
1,170 radio stations nationwide, has circulated a list of 150 songs
and asked its stations to avoid playing them because of the attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon."

The songs to be avoided include the notably cruel and inflammatory song
"Imagine" by John Lennon. (!) But while this one is on it's face
ridiculous, stupidly reactionary, etc, that shouldn't obscure the fact
that *any* censorship at this time is a big mistake, which will only
erode what ever ethical highground we might claim.  The call to avoid
*any* song by Rage Against the Machine, for instance, equates honest
political debate, the lifeblood of a democracy, with insurrection.  This
strikes me as quite dangerous.

i've been holding onto my cat a lot in the last week.  she is a very
pleasant transitional object.  she does not represent aggressive
nationalism.  she seems glad to serve the function of transitional object,
though she wakes me up many times a night and i am mildly allergic. she is
not as colorful as an american flag but her texture, heft and
responsiveness are far more inviting, and she purrs on my lap as i type
into the screen, and licks my breakfast bowl when i'm done.  i seem to be
having trouble with my social skills --i get exhausted by minor
conversations, holding my office hours, etc.  but my classes are going okay
i guess.  happy new year everyone.

I have heard several people on the list now say something like what you just
said, Brent: "What I don't get is these leftists who will jump in and defend
the Muslim Extremists."  Now, I have been paying attention, & except for
that day when there were roughly 90 messages from Poetics & I couldn't read
all the long ones, I don't think I've missed much.  And I have not heard
anyone DEFEND Muslim extremists.  (Defending innocent Muslims who might not
be extremists is another matter).  I have not heard anyone CONDONE
terrorism.  I have not heard anyone say for one moment that what happened
last week can in any sense be justified.

What I HAVE heard some people say is that these attacks did not occur in an
historical vacuum; that in order to prevent this from happening again--
perhaps with numbing regularity-- it might be wise to understand the
cultural and historical context out of which they arose.  (I have also heard
people say, perhaps more pointedly, look at what the United States has done
in the region &, well, what goes around may indeed come around.  I don't
read such arguments as a "defense" or a gainsaying of the attacks, so much
as a move precisely to understand them contextually, & to counter the
rhetoric of "good" vs. "evil."  In terms of governments, if not of the
innocent dead & their rescuers, there are no "goods" here, only greater &
lesser degrees of culpability-- just as, if it *is* bin Laden, the Taliban
is surely to a degree culpable).

Then, I have heard others make blanket claims about the "leftists" on this
list.  Is the move to understand, to contextualize, automatically equivalent
to the move to defend?  (It seems to me this would put psychologists who
study criminal behavior out of a job).  I agree with Marjorie Perloff that
the ability to see nuances is welcome, now as ever.  Maybe we can begin by
recognizing the differences between what I think I have read on the list &
what Brent thinks he has read.

Best wishes,

Mark DuCharme

   Yes -- Actually, this list is finding such incredible info sources --
does anyone know a site that tracks/lists reports of/ unaccounted-for nukes
and weapons-grade plutonium?

   We actually used to have a joking map for sale here in DC, a satellite
photo of the area with concentric circles drawn over it, and the Pentagon
labeled "Ground Zero."  That was in the Cold War era, and with the end of
it, and the dismantling of ICBMs by both the US and the Soviets and their
successor nations, it seemed like that whole way of thinking had become an
anachronism.

  And now it's back.  I live 1/3 mile from the Capitol, and work 1/8 mile
from the Capitol on the other side, at the Labor Dept -- I can see the Dome
out my window now.  (These eerie, beautiful days.)  Something went boom at
5am this morning, and I woke up utterly freaked.  Probably a sonic boom --
there was one last Tuesday morning as fighter jets went north after what we
later learned was the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania -- but I woke up
with my heart racing.

Well, here's my piss into the ocean.
xox,
Marcella

Dear President Bush,

This e-mail to you is to express my sincere desire that a careful, accurate
and patient investigation be conducted that identifies and punishes only
those responsible for this crime, rather than conducting a blind "crusade"
overseas that will only kill more innocent people. I want to express to you
my hope that every effort to preserve international peace be made by the
United States.

I live in downtown New York, a mile from "ground zero." My mother lives
seven blocks from the World Trade Center--she was shocked, traumatized and
is now homeless. I think I can speak for most New Yorkers when I say that we
are all horrified and shellshocked by the events of the last few days.
However, the last thing I could bear right now is for my country to
perpetuate more chaos and destruction for any innocent men, women and
children in the world, especially after seeing how awful it is firsthand to
be the target of an attack.

I appreciate that our people want justice, and I certainly want it, too.
However, I do not want it at the cost of any more innocent lives. I want my
country to be better, more intelligent, more compassionate, more measured
than that. A premature rush to arms may only prolong this tragedy and
permanently damage our position overseas. I want those--and only
those--responsible for this crime to be the ones brought to justice. And,
justice, for me, would be to imprison the perpetrators for their entire
lives (as they have so obviously demonstrated that being put to death would
be no punishment for them) so that they may reflect for years on what they
have done.

Thank you very much for your kind attention to my e-mail.

Sincerely,
Marcella Durand

Hi Lawrence -

The energy contained in each jet blast on the towers was estimated at about
1/20th of the explosion of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima.  Given
that the jet blasts inside the towers were contained primarily in a very
small space relative to the Hiroshima or Nagasaki bursts, those blasts
inside the WTC towers were as powerful & certainly as devastating and
intense for their intended targets as those infamous bombs, if not more so.
But OK, no radiation came from these WTC blasts.  I just mean to give you
something to consider.  Yes, nukes would have been far worse in some cases.
But a nuke can be *less* devastating as well.  It depends upon the bomb
itself.  They make 'em small nowadays.

Thank god the planes were not made out of depleted uranium.

Best,
Patrick

The past week list has been such a good source of
information, comfort, sensitivity, criticism =
COMMUNITY and I thank you all for that.

Re: flag waving.  I am so conflicted about this.  Our
across-the-street neighbors put up a flag last
Wednesday and I immediately wanted one, too -- not as
a show of strength or government support or even
solidarity, but from some deep feeling of gratitude
that this country was still standing.  That the
weather in Boston was beautiful and that I still had
across-the-street neighbors.  Last week all of that
seemed like a miracle.

Since then, I have been able to be more critical and
wary of the whole flag-waving phenomenon, but I am
also still very conflicted and interested in what it
means to be a patriotic American.  I certainly think
one can be patriotic AND critical, and that in fact
the two probably go hand in hand.  I disagree much of
what our government says, I am distraught over what we
have done to the earth, etc., etc., and I have even
(often?) thought of leaving the country, but I also
love it.  I love the geographical and ethnic
diversity, the aesthetic beauty of the national parks,
the openness.  I am so proud that Americans invented
hip hop, bluegrass, jazz and rock n' roll.  I love my
students, many of whom are first-generation college
students and have so much to give, so many ideas.  Can
I wave a flag for all of that?

I also love, and miss, New York City, which, for the
five years I lived there, treated me with extreme
kindness and openness, and which, as exhausting and
ugly as it could be, was also frequently stunning and
inspiring, and like no other city in the world.  So
when all this happened, I wanted to wave a flag for
that, too.

MEDIA ADVISORY:
Media March to War

September 17, 2001

In the wake of the devastating attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, many media pundits focused on one theme: retaliation. For some, it
did not matter who bears the brunt of an American attack:

"There is only one way to begin to deal with people like this, and that is
you have to kill some of them even if they are not immediately directly
involved in this thing."
--former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger (CNN, 9/11/01)

"The response to this unimaginable 21st-century Pearl Harbor should be as
simple as it is swift-- kill the bastards. A gunshot between the eyes, blow
them to smithereens, poison them if you have to.  As for cities or countries
that host these worms, bomb them into basketball courts."
--Steve Dunleavy (New York Post, 9/12/01)

"America roused to a righteous anger has always been a force for good.
States that have been supporting if not Osama bin Laden, people like him
need to feel pain. If we flatten part of Damascus or Tehran or whatever it
takes, that is part of the solution."
--Rich Lowry, National Review editor, to Howard Kurtz (Washington Post,
9/13/01)

"TIME TO TAKE NAMES AND NUKE AFGHANISTAN."
--Caption to cartoon by Gary Brookins (Richmond Times-Dispatch, 9/13/01)

"At a bare minimum, tactical nuclear capabilites should be used against the
bin Laden camps in the desert of Afghanistan. To do less would be rightly
seen by the poisoned minds that orchestrated these attacks as cowardice on
the part of the United States and the current administration."
--Former Defense Intelligence Agency officer Thomas Woodrow, "Time to Use
the Nuclear Option" (Washington Times, 9/14/01)

Bill O'Reilly: "If the Taliban government of Afghanistan does not cooperate,
then we will damage that government with air power, probably. All right? We
will blast them, because..."

Sam Husseini, Institute for Public Accuracy: "Who will you kill in the
process?"

O'Reilly: "Doesn't make any difference."
--("The O'Reilly Factor," Fox News Channel, 9/13/01)

"This is no time to be precise about locating the exact individuals
directly involved in this particular terrorist attack.... We should invade
their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity.  We
weren't punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top
officers.  We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians.  That's war.
And this is war."
--Syndicated columnist Ann Coulter (New York Daily News, 9/12/01)


"Real" Retribution

Many media commentators appeared to blame the attacks on what they saw as
America's unwillingness to act aggressively in recent years.

As conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer (Washington Post, 9/12/01)
wrote: "One of the reasons there are enough terrorists out there capable and
deadly enough to carry out the deadliest attack on the United States in its
history is that, while they have declared war on us, we have in the past
responded (with the exception of a few useless cruise missile attacks on
empty tents in the desert) by issuing subpoenas."

The Washington Post's David Broder (9/13/01), considered a moderate, issued
his own call for "new realism-- and steel-- in America's national security
policy": "For far too long, we have been queasy about responding to
terrorism. Two decades ago, when those with real or imagined grievances
against the United States began picking off Americans overseas on military
or diplomatic assignments or on business, singly or in groups, we delivered
pinprick retaliations or none at all."

It's worth recalling the U.S. response to the bombing of a Berlin disco in
April 1986, which resulted in the deaths of two U.S. service members: The
U.S. immediately bombed Libya, which it blamed for the attack. According to
Libya, 36 civilians were killed in the air assault, including the year-old
daughter of Libyan leader Moamar Khadafy (Washington Post, 5/9/86). It is
unlikely that Libyans considered this a "pinprick." Yet these deaths
apparently had little deterrence value: In December 1988, less than 20
months later, Pan Am 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in an even
deadlier act of
terrorism the U.S. blames on Libyan agents.

More recently, in 1998, Bill Clinton sent 60 cruise missiles, some equipped
with cluster bombs, against bin Laden's Afghan base, in what was presented
as retaliation for the bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa. One missile
aimed at Afghan training camps landed hundreds of miles off course in
Pakistan, while a simultaneous attack in Sudan leveled one of the country's
few pharmaceutical factories. Media cheered the attacks (In These Times,
9/6/98), though careful investigation into the case revealed no credible
evidence linking the plant to chemical weapons or Osama bin Laden, the two
justifications offered for the attack (New York Times, 10/27/99, London
Observer, 8/23/98).

Despite the dubious record of retributory violence in insuring security,
many pundits insist that previous retaliation failed only because it was not
severe enough. As the Chicago Tribune's John Kass declared (9/13/01), "For
the past decade we've sat dumb and stupid as the U.S. military was
transformed from a killing machine into a playpen for sociologists and
political schemers." This "playpen" dropped 23,000 bombs on Yugoslavia in
1999, killing between 500 and 1,500 civilians, and may have killed as many
as 1,200 Iraqis in 1998's Desert Fox attack (Agence France Presse,
12/23/98).

The Wall Street Journal (9/13/01) urged the U.S. to "get serious" about
terrorism by, among other things, eliminating "the 1995 rule, imposed by
former CIA Director John Deutsch under political pressure, limiting whom the
U.S. can recruit for counter-terrorism. For fear of hiring rogues, the CIA
decided it would only hire Boy Scouts." One non-Boy Scout the CIA worked
with in the 1980s is none other than Osama bin Laden (MSNBC, 8/24/98; The
Atlantic, 7-8/01)-- then considered a valuable asset in the fight against
Communism, but now suspected of being the chief instigator of the World
Trade Center attacks.


Who's to Blame?

In crisis situations, particularly those involving terrorism, media often
report unsubstantiated information about suspects or those claiming
responsibility-- an error that is especially dangerous in the midst of calls
for military retaliation.

Early reports on the morning of the attack indicated that the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine had claimed responsibility on Abu
Dhabi Television. Most outlets were careful with the information, though
NBC's Tom Brokaw, while not confirming the story, added fuel to the fire:
"This comes, ironically, on a day when the Israel Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres is scheduled to meet with Yasser Arafat. Of course, we've had the
meeting in South Africa for the past several days in which the Palestinians
were accusing the Israelis of racism"-- as if making such an accusation were
tantamount to blowing up the World Trade Center.

Hours after a spokesperson for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine denied any responsibility for the attack, the Drudge Report
website still had the headline "Palestinian Group Says Responsible" at the
top of the page.

Though the threat from a Palestinian group proved unsubstantiated, that did
not stop media from making gross generalizations about Arabs and Islam in
general. New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wondered (9/13/01):
"Surely Islam, a grand religion that never perpetrated the sort of Holocaust
against the Jews in its midst that Europe did, is being distorted when it is
treated as a guidebook for suicide bombing. How is it that not a single
Muslim leader will say that?"

Of course, many Muslims would-- and did-- say just that.  Political and
civil leaders throughout the Muslim world have condemned the attacks, and
Muslim clerics throughout the Middle East have given sermons refuting the
idea that targeting civilians is a tenet of Islam (BBC, 9/14/01; Washington
Post 9/17/01).


Why They Hate Us

As the media investigation focused on Osama bin Laden, news outlets still
provided little information about what fuels his fanaticism. Instead of a
serious inquiry into anti-U.S. sentiment in the Middle East and elsewhere,
many commentators media offered little more than self-congratulatory
rhetoric:

"[The World Trade Center and the Pentagon] have drawn, like gathered
lightning, the anger of the enemies of civilization. Those enemies are
always out there.... Americans are slow to anger but mighty when angry, and
their proper anger now should be alloyed with pride. They are targets
because of their virtues--principally democracy, and loyalty to those
nations which, like Israel, are embattled salients of our virtues in a
still-dangerous world."
--George Will (Washington Post, 9/12/01)

"This nation symbolizes freedom, strength, tolerance, and democratic
principles dedicated to both liberty and peace. To the tyrants, the despots,
the closed societies, there are no alterations to the policies, no gestures
we can make, no words we can say that will convince those determined to
continue their hate."
--Charles G. Boyd (Washington Post, 9/12/01)

"Are Americans afraid to face the reality that there is a significant
portion of this world's population that hates America, hates what freedom
represents, hates the fact that we fight for freedom worldwide, hates our
prosperity, hates our way of life? Have we been unwilling to face that very
difficult reality?"
--Sean Hannity (Fox News Channel, 9/13/01)

"Our principled defense of individual freedom and our reluctance to
intervene in the affairs of states harboring terrorists makes us an easy
target."
--Robert McFarlane (Washington Post, 9/13/01)

One exception was ABC's Jim Wooten (World News Tonight, 9/12/01), who tried
to shed some light on what might motivate some anti-U.S. sentiment in the
Middle East, reporting that "Arabs see the U.S. as an accomplice of Israel,
a partner in what they believe is the ruthless repression of Palestinian
aspirations for land and independence." Wooten continued: "The most
provocative issues: Israel's control over Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem;
the stationing of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia near some of Islam's holiest
sites; and economic sanctions against Iraq, which have been seen to deprive
children there of medicine and food."

Stories like Wooten's, which examine the U.S.'s highly contentious role in
the Middle East and illuminate some of the forces that can give rise to
violent extremism, contribute far more to public security than do pundits
calling for indiscriminate revenge.

About ten years ago Geoff Young published a book of mine.  At his suggestion
we titled it New York.  In it there is a piece, a bit of memoir, that
centers on the Williams poem, THE GREAT FIGURE, his poem about a New York
City firetruck.  The piece also refers to the famous Charles Demuth
paintings, with the same title, that the Williams poem inspired.

Hook and Ladder Company 5 was a Greenwich Village company, stationed in that
modern firehouse at the corner of Houston and Sixth, at the edge of Soho. I
am sure many of you have passed it.  If I understand correctly what I read
in this morning's New York Times, all or some of the men in that company are
dead.  Surely the engine itself, the namesake of the apparatus Williams
caught sight of responding to a call one night, is gone too.

THE GREAT FIGURE

Among the rain
and lights
I saw the figure 5
in gold
on a red
firetruck
moving
tense
unheeded
to gong clangs
siren howls
and wheels rumbling
through the dark city.

Jerry Falwell isn't the only one eating his words nowadays. Karlheinz
Stockhausen speaks (as you'll see in the NYT articles just below my
sign-off) and issues an instant retraction, as can be well understood.
Many others, I suspect, will are and will be, for various reasons, eating
their words in coming days, weeks, and months: myself included
perhaps, for I think I know what Stockhausen had in mind when he
called the WTC attacks a great work of art--no, "the greatest work
of art ever."

Art and great disasters have some similar effects. They slow and very
nearly stop time. We stop and stare at images of bodies hurtling from
towers as we do at Rembrandt portraits in our museums, or as we
sit in the dark for hours, listening to an orchestra or a string quartet
or a rock group or jazz band. Sometimes, if we're lucky (or unlucky,
depending on how one looks at it) we emerge altered, changed,
sometimes shaken to the depths of our being, as much of the world
was this last week.

Then we come out of it--out of the museum, the concert hall, the
dive, the TV haze in which we've been immersed, and we look
around and find the same streets, the same traffic, the same old
living room or bedroom or den--same but somehow different.

For those of us in New York, we look south along familiar streets
and avenues and those two towers are no longer there. And there
are new things there--faces of the missing plastered to walls and
trees and mailboxes, clusters of offerings and burning candles
in unexpected places, a cyclone fence festooned with yet another
crop of yellow ribbons.

And much seems much the same--Chuckie, our cat, seems not
to have heard of the disaster, though he sometimes seems very
much aware of altered moods hereabouts. He wants fresh food,
and a bit of milk in the morning. Our neighbors walk their dogs
and jog along the Hudson. The fruit vendors are out on the
streets, and in some respect things are beginning to return to
"normal"--in some ways what we yearn for, those days and
weeks and months speeding by as though they were minutes
and seconds and nanoseconds--the passing scene, the
slippery slope.

Attacks Called Great Art

The composer Karlheinz Stockhausen caused outrage in Germany
when he described the terrorist attacks in the United States last week
as "the greatest work of art ever," Agence France-Presse reported
yesterday.

Mr. Stockhausen, 73, who made the remark to journalists in Hamburg
on Sunday, retracted it at once and asked that it not be reported.

But two Stockhausen concerts scheduled for yesterday and today in a
festival in Hamburg were canceled.

"Out of feeling for the political culture of the city and the federal republic,
the concerts had to be canceled," said Christina Weiss, Hamburg culture
commissioner.

Agence France-Presse reported that according to the news agency DPA,
Mr. Stockhausen responded to a question about the attacks on the United
States by saying: "What happened there is — they all have to rearrange their
brains now — is the greatest work of art ever.

"That characters can bring about in one act what we in music cannot dream
of, that people practice madly for 10 years, completely, fanatically, for a
concert and then die. That is the greatest work of art for the whole cosmos.

"I could not do that. Against that, we, composers, are nothing."

Mr. Stockhausen was reported to have left Hamburg in distress.

Here's some additional information from friends as of Monday, September
17, 2001:


The fire commissioner just announced that they want NO MORE
VOLUNTEERS at the site. Apparently there have been people posing as FDNY
and
there have been instances of 'volunteers' looting. (note: I had to have
a
drunk guy with no clearance arrested yesterday for hijacking a food
delivery,
believe it or not. - NB) He also said that they have more than enough
people
right now & much as they appreciate it, they really can't handle the
organization of the 'outside' volunteers.  If you could pass this on to
people - though yesterday at the Javitz center they told us to come back

today and see if we were needed.



ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE PREVIOUS DATA ENTRY EXPERIENCE OR KNOW 'ACCESS'

Subject: Red Cross/Web Grrls Data Entry Volunteer

I am a member of the NYC Webgrrls Chapter.  They are looking for
volunteers who are at least somewhat technically proficient in data
entry (i.e. Database entry via Access or similar) to help the Red
Cross process all the volunteer applications they are getting.  I
have donated my services for the second shift over the weekend.
Below you will find the info I received from Webgrrls.  Contact
Eileen directly if you can help!

J

Hi ladies,

The Red Cross needs tech support. Right now, we are putting together
shifts of Webgrrls to do data entry. You must be minimally
technically proficient enough to enter data into a database. I
believe you/we will be entering volunteer info into a database so the
Red Cross can begin to make sense of the thousands of volunteer
applications they have received. Here's the details:

1.  TODAY - Goal is to get 10 to 12 Webgrrls working by 4PM. CALL ME
at 212-260-7882 if you can get to the Red Cross TODAY by 4PM to do
data entry. You will be there from 4PM until... whenever. Probably
about 8 hours or as long as you can, but you should be able to stay
for a good chunk of hours.

2.  TOMORROW (Friday)
FIRST SHIFT = 8AM to 4PM
SECOND SHIFT = 3PM to 11PM

3.  SATURDAY, SUNDAY, etc. will follow the same shifts until
otherwise notified.

4.  HELP IS ALSO NEEDED BY ME TO SCHEDULE PEOPLE AND HANDLE PHONE
CALLS. If you are interested, let me know when you call.

The Red Cross is located at 150 Amsterdam at 66th Street. There will
be a table set up for Webgrrls registration, however, you need to
CALL ME at 212-260-7882 so that I can let them know and you can
bypass the hundreds of people who are lined up outside and trying to
volunteer. You will go directly to the Webgrrls table, fill out a
paper application, and then proceed to the 2nd Floor (I think) where
the group will do data entry. If you are familiar with Access, let me
know, and I will make you "Shift Commander" to help those who may not
be as familiar. Please do not use this opportunity to learn database
entry for the first time...

Please CALL ME at 212-260-7882 to discuss. Priority will be given to
those who can make it today, but I will schedule everyone. As you can
imagine, the scene will be highly stressed and there won't be a lot
of time for questions, training or special schedule requirements. Be
prepared to go with the flow and show the world that NYC Webgrrls are
here to help.

Best,

Eileen

ron, i'm gonna try to keep this as short as possible, given the
traffic... so i'll use shorthand, and sacrifice some detail...

loved your post, but you lost me right at the end... you want to
maintain that this is an act of war---with (i suppose) civilian
casualities---and not simply a criminal act... ergo e.g. cnn's
"america's new war" is appropriate then, in your view?... in any
case, re your item (1):

(1) proving itself to be better than terrorists by not targeting civilians

suggests that the u.s. "target" someone, somehow, yes?... if the left
is not to lose any and all support publicly, as you say, can it
likewise avoid discussion, at the same time, of what ought now to be
the purpose of our military-police-intelligence branches?...
specifically in terms of *offense*, as you imply something other than
a strictly defensive posture...

what do you mean, exactly, by "war"?... please believe me---i'm not
asking you to define your terms out of some petty desire to pester
you at the semantic level...

and just to be clear:  like you, i fear further, more extensive
terrorist assaults here in the u.s... and like you, i can't imagine
that asking u.s. citizens to hold themselves entirely responsible for
this calamity will speak in any pragmatic way either to the public
domain ("lived experience" or "structures of feeling" or just plain
pain) or to the realities of the (dauntingly complex
international-political) situation... i *do* regard u.s. ideology
abroad (and for that matter, at home) a significant factor in the
current conflict, given the historical ebbs and flows of the planet's
nation-states (i.e., terrorism of this sort takes *time*---it doesn't
happen overnight)... like taylor, the moment i pipe up publicly
against e.g. bombing, first thing i hear---the very first thing---is
along the lines of (and with anti-patriotic accusation right around
the corner) "but what are we supposed to DO about bin laden?" (or,
whoever is ultimately proved to be most directly culpable)... like
marjorie, i can't say i'm happy with tout court renunciations of the
u.s. in any and all of its manifestations... like daniel, the class
issues that underwrite "our" responses (e.g., flag-waving) hit me at
a pretty profound level... and like don, the binary "we" seem caught
in, both intellectual and affective, is something i'm struggling with
*by the hour*...

so, some clarification here, if you please... i'm not sure we'll
ultimately agree, ron, but i'm hoping we can all move one another's
ideas forward some... me, i'm all ears...

also, and for the record, bravo! to marcella's letter...

peace,

joe

I'm justifying a reply to a post probably meant mainly
for Americans by pleading some involvement in a
nascent anti-war movement in New Zealand. (For
information on the situation here, visit
www.indymedia.org.nz/)

Ron Silliman is absolutely right when he urges an
engagement with the grief of Westerners as the correct
starting point for leftist activity in the aftermath
of last week's attacks. In my opinion, though, he
wrongly treats the nature of majority opinion at the
moment as irreversible, and in doing so misses the
logic and the potential of much of the left-wing
agitation that has taken place in the aftermath of the
attacks. (Take, as a paradigm for the left reaction,
Noam Chomsky's 'A Quick Response', which was posted
here the other day.)


The  grief that the NYC atrocity has created is a
double-edged sword. On the one hand, it may be used by
 Western leaders to stir up assent for all sorts of
dangerous war games and reactionary legislation.

Less obviously, though, the  grief we have seen has
the potential to lead to mass anti-war radicalisation
across the West.

The tremendous empathy which has been stirred, in the
West and in much of the Third World, for the victims
of last week's attacks is authentic, and thus has the
ability to build and spread and break through the
national and ethnic barriers manned by warmongering
political leaders and the mass media. It is surely
significant that  the  first reported anti-war
protests occurred in New York City, home to a
population which must find it the easiest of all to
empathise with the September 11th victims.


We should also note that the events of the past two
weeks have, to a limited but real extent, cohered
populations atomised in most places by decades of
rightist economic restructuring. The fragmentation and
depoliticisation of the working class which were a key
achievement of neoliberalism are weakened by the mass
action and collective focus which have followed last
week's attacks. Suddenly vast numbers of people are
attuned to the idea of collective action;  they are
also asking many awkward asking questions about the
world about them, allowing us to talk about the
potential for  ideological as well as emotional
radicalisation.

The magnitude of recent events forces, after all, the
consideration of many hitherto obscure or taboo
subjects; beyond that, it may prompt a questioning of
the very nature of twenty-first century life. In
post-Cold War, secular and somewhat cynical Western
milieu, there is reason to suspect that the conceptual
framework that political and business leaders act
inside and speak from will fail to answer such
questions convincingly. We ought to remember here that
the West was not a nest of contentment before
September the 11th: the large anti-globalisation
protests which had become a symbol of an unhappiness
with contemporary Western society had been scheduled,
after all, to arrive in Washington DC at the end of
this month.


Like every other relatively sane person, I wish that
the events of September 11th had not occurred. They
were a moral disaster and a political disaster.

The left, though, has to face the reality of September
11th, and it can only do this by engaging with the
contradictions the event has produced in popular
consciousness. The source of all terrorisms is
capitalism and imperialism, and only anti-capitalist,
anti-imperialist politics can counter all terrorisms.
Leftist writers as different as Chomsky and Said are
right to sense the potential for such politics, in the
aftermath of September 11th. From Pakistan to America
to New Zealand, the  war machine has to be disabled by
mass direct action. This task may be very difficult,
but its proponents are surely not as unrealistic as
the Guardian columnists who call for the civilising of
imperialism in the Middle East.


As an NYC paramedic wrote, at the end of an account of
his rescue efforts at the WTC:

"This is a tragic act, one that has destroyed or
forever altered the lives of countless people. It is
also an act that occurs in particular
context, one in which the United States is guilty of
this exact same kind of crime, only on a greater and
more gruesome scale. Let us take from this
the inspiration to create a world free from
imperialism in all its manifestations, one that moves
us from the civil war that is capitalism
to a higher form of society..."

"Chris Buckley, Christian Aid Programme Officer for Afghanistan

I have just returned from Afghanistan, and cannot avoid a growing
feeling of dread at what may be about to befall the people I have left
there. The bellicose statements being issued by America and her allies
about revenge and retaliation for Tuesday's horrific terrorist attacks
against New York and Washington seem to be softening up western
electorates for some kind of massive military action against the
Afghan people.

Because of these threats, aid organisations have been forced to pull
out their foreign workers - fearing both that they may be caught in
the expected raids, or that they would be attacked as westerners after
the NATO bombers have flown away. The effects of this withdrawal could
be infinitely more tragic and devastating than the worst that a
wounded America may now throw at this long, long-suffering country.

For, although it has gone largely unreported, Afghanistan is in the
grip of a three-year drought and on the verge of mass
starvation. According to the UN-run World Food Programme, by the end
of the year 5.5 million people will be entirely dependent on food aid
to survive the winter - that's a quarter of the Afghan population.

As Christian Aid's programme officer responsible for Afghanistan, I
have been helping supply food and seeds to communities in desperate
need. In a few weeks the winter snows will come, cutting off the
hundreds of isolated villages whose only links to the outside world
are rutted dirt tracks.  Without seeds they will be unable to replant
for next year. Without food aid now, thousands could be dead before
the spring.

Already fears on the ground about this pending catastrophe are
filtering through. Only yesterday (Thurs) I received this message from
one of the local organisations funded by Christian Aid.

'What will happen to the people if aid agencies remain reluctant to
resume full operations? The consequences are quite clear that people
who are already suffering would be the victims. And if any military
action is taken, Afghan staff and civilians will be in real danger.

'Terrorism is the worst thing and it shows how blind these people are
as human beings. But if the leaders do not have patience and tolerance
they can only do further damage.'

This, I think you must agree, is not a voice from a country of
dedicated international terrorists or religious fanatics. But it is a
voice from the real Afghanistan, unrecognisable from the demonised
image we are being urged to accept.

The real Afghanistan is one where 85 per cent of the population are
subsistence farmers. Most Afghans don't have newspapers, television
sets or radios. They will not have heard of the World Trade Centre or
the Pentagon, and most will have no idea that a group of zealots has
attacked these icons of western civilisation. There isn't even a
postal service.

Now, in these isolated villages, families are down to their last few
weeks of food and already men women and children in the bulging
refugee camps are dying of cholera and malnutrition. I have spoken to
orphans with swollen bellies. I have spoken to men who have no money
to hire trucks to escape the drought and make it to the camps. I have
spoken to families who say they will wait in their villages for death.

And that was before the aid agencies were forced to withdraw. Afghans
are not willing victims - they are hardy peoples, as any Soviet
general will testify. For the past three years they have been doing
all they can to survive - sharing food, borrowing money to buy food,
crossing the borders with Pakistan and Iran to find illegal,
badly-paid work. Many used to work on the opium farms as casual
labourers.

But all these sources of income have dried up. Pakistan and Iran are
throwing thousands of Afghans out each month, the Taliban have banned
opium production and there is no food or credit to be had after three
years of drought.

And as I write this, our worst fears have just been realised. I have
just received the following message from a friend who works for
another of our partner organisations in western Afghanistan. He
writes: 'I hope you are fine. We have spoken to the World Food
Programme in Herat, and asked them to release food so we can
distribute it to our beneficiaries who are in severe need. But WFP has
stopped their activities right now. Could you please see if it is
possible to get the release from WFP?'

That is a real cry for help. Other friends there have stressed the
need for the world to adopt a comprehensive approach to the terrorist
threat - addressing the underlying causes of this terrifying
phenomenon rather than just seeking to extract revenge.


Let me be clear. The murder of thousands of innocent Americans has
shocked and appalled us all. But any military action which disrupts
the flow of aid to millions [!] of equally innocent Afghans would be
equally immoral.

Christian Aid urges everyone involved to show civilised restraint in
responding to an act of barbarism. Thousands of innocent people have
died in the United States. We must now make sure that even more
innocent lives are not lost."

Subject: [ISSHO] interview with techno critic toshiya ueno

Dear ISSHO members,

below you'll find an interview that I did with the cultural studies scholar
Toshiya Ueno (Wako University, Tokyo). I am looking for a magazine in Japan
that would like to run it. If you want to forward it to certain media or
collegues, please feel free to do so.

With regards,

Urban Techno Tribes and the Japanese Recession
Interview with Toshiya Ueno
By Geert Lovink

Toshiya Ueno is a Japanese sociologist, media theorist and critic. In May
1990, when I was introduced to Toshiya in Tokyo during my first visit to
Japan, I could not quite make out who he was. His English was poor and so
was my Japanese. I had heard about his institutional involvement and his
career as a popular columnist for fashion, design and computer magazines. In
1992, when he came to Amsterdam for the first time we slowly got to know
each other and by the mid-nineties our friendship was established. He kept
coming back to Europe and became a regular visitor of the Ars Electronica
festival, reporting for Japanese magazines. At that point Toshiya's English
skills increased dramatically and a fierce dialogue about media theory
issues and the state of new media culture worldwide started between us. A
few times a years Toshiya would stay in the tiny guest room of my former
Amsterdam house. He gradually left the official Japanese new media business
and started to investigate Amsterdam's free media scene, drugs culture and
the (Goa) techno trance scene in particular. Through the lively refugee
tribes from former Yugoslavia based in Amsterdam Toshiya came in contact
with techno-trance rave scenes in Croatia where he made his debut as a DJ
and TJ (text jockey), a passion he would continue in Japan. Our
collaboration would take us from Internet conferences in Europe, a annual
five years long teaching project at Osaka's Inter Media Institute (IMI), a
common trip to Taipei to co-producing a television show about Amsterdam's
subculture. In this e-mail exchange we have focussed only on a few aspects
of Toshiya's work: the notions of urban tribes and digital diaspora, the use
of technology in subcultures and the need in Japan to cross boundaries and
start a dialogue and exchange between various scenes.

Toshiya Ueno is an associate professor at the Expressive Cultures Department
at Wako University, Tokyo. Several of his papers in English are available in
the Nettime archive (www.nettime.org). He is preparing a book titled "Urban
Tribal Studies" with the Amsterdam-based Croatian sociologist Benjamin
Perasovic. His published books, in Japanese, amongst others, are "Situation,
Cultural Politics of Rock and Pop (Sakuhinsha, 1996), "Artificial Nature, On
Cyborg Politics" (Keisoshobo, 1996), "Thinking Diaspora" (Chikuma Shobo,
1999) and "Cultural Studies, an Introduction" (With Joshi Mori, Chikuma
Shobo, 2000, vol.2 coming up).

GL: In retrospect, how would you describe the nineties in Japan? It seems
such a strange period, where not that much seems to have happened. It more
looked like a never-ending mild recession. A sweet stagnation without brutal
Thatcherism. No crucial decisions were made. No drastic cuts. No equivalent
of the fall of the Berlin wall. No uprisings. There weren't even dramatic
political and economic changes following the 1997 Asian financial crisis and
countless bank scandals. The cultural climate seemed dominated by a ongoing
consumerism, yet in a less ecstatic way compared to the bubble years of the
mid-late eighties. A sophisticated numbness and joyful innocence could be
found amongst youngsters. How could this odd mix of technological speed and
pop fashion admits an ongoing recession result in such an amazing soft
stagnation? Please tell me if I am wrong. If this model is running out now
do you see any signs of discontent or even protest?

TU: Your description may be right until mid 90s, the days just after the
collapse of the speculative and 'bubble' economy. But around 1999 a drastic
storm of 'neo-liberalism' set in. Ordinary people were seemingly not aware
of this crisis in their everyday life. However, if you turned your eyes to
the micro level you could find lots of symptoms of a collapsing corporate
welfare state. There have been many lay-offs, 'restructuring' of businesses
and various cases of 'privatization' of the public sector such as museums,
institutions and state universities. Until 1995 people did not feel these
measures and were by and large unaware of the coming crisis. Since 3 or 4
years however we are facing a 'second hand' version of 'populism' in the
UK-style. Politicians have been quite influential in this process. It did
not matter whether his/her political stand point were left or right, liberal
or conservative, global thinking or nationalistic. These days novelists and
TV stars are capable of winning an election and become president of a local
prefecture or win a seat in the national parliament. Some of them are
significant figures in Japanese subculture.
During the recession the cultural or expressive sector of society was deeply
damaged. It has become difficult to find a publishing house for books that
have a theoretical or political content. I was saddened with the absence of
uprisings or riots, yes. But I also have to say there have been numerous
revolutions, even though most of them came from conservative and reactionary
side. 'Revolution' is the very nature of neo-liberalism. Japanese society is
following the same process which the UK and US experienced earlier. On the
other hand one has to see the singularity of the Japanese 90's. We could for
instance point at the transversality (a notion of Deleuze/Guattari) and
singularity of the economical, cultural and even political crisis.

GL: Is it useful to integrate the notions of subculture and media as
developed by UK cultural studies into your research about Japan?

TU: Cultural studies UK-style and its versions in other Asian regions are of
importance to me. I do not want to reduce cultural studies to political and
theoretical reflections on Japan's imperial and colonial past, neither to a
sociology of popular culture. In the UK, cultural studies has also been
tactical criticism and a theoretical weapon against populist neo-liberal
politics within the everyday life. Cultural studies were not just an
analytical tool, it was also related to real micro and cultural politics
against the populism sprouting of neo-liberalism. I am referring here to
do-it-yourself, Rock Against Racism, the movement against Criminal Justice
Act and so on.
Until recently I have also been thinking why we did not have protest
movements in Japan. But now I am more interested in doing something real and
respond to the seemingly invisible and intangible crisis. We can make
something happen in this situation. Although neo-liberalism is really shit,
it is also true that it can also generate forms of resistance against
itself. A few years ago, in Germany and Amsterdam, I came across the rave
party phenomena. I discovered music-based subcultures even though rock had
long been a part of my life. Rave culture has got something for me. Rave is
based on hedonistic desire and fun, but at the same time it can also be
connected with environmental awareness. It is a movement in itself with its
own anarchist politics. For instance pirate radio is often used these days
to broadcast from rave parties.
In the early 90's I used to be a critic of contemporary art, music, film and
all kinds of expressive cultures. Those were the so-called postmodern days.
At that time the Japanese economy was still a powerful force. The
speculative 'bubble' economy needed, even preferred, 'speculative' essays
and articles. Under those circumstances I wrote a lot of papers and essays
for a myriad of magazines. However, when I came across rave I realized that
music was the most important thing for me and my critical interpretive
ability was most suitable for the music and its cultural and political
implications. That's when I stopped writing about other fields such as new
media theory and the arts. Within the rave movement I found a lot of
elements I was interested in and involved with before, for instance, free
radio, techno music, ecology movement, quasi-squat activities, anarchism,
dissident politics, and also visual designs of party gear--decorations which
are related to contemporary and electronic arts. All the elements I had been
interested in so far were coming together in rave. I started to elaborate my
own theory based on everyday experiences.

GL: Do you think that techno culture is part of the leisure industry to
forget daily boredom?

TU: A party is not a festival or carnival to forget the routine of the
everyday life. A party is a critical part within the everyday. Sometimes
people think of a rave as a unusual event which is opposite to the everyday
life as a 'temporary autonomous zone' (Hakim Bey). For some scholars raves
are conceived and interpreted as disorder, chaos, a marginal experience,
frequently depending on communitas and liminality arguments as developed by
Victor Turner. Theoretically speaking these arguments are rather banal.
Raves or parties are not liminal or marginal. One can bring in elements such
as the gift economy, open minded communication, abandoning the sexual
'picking up,' environmental consciousness and so on. Even though it seems
that rave and party can occur beyond the everyday life, beyond the border
between order and disorder, the usual and unusual. Because of my involvement
in rave culture people in liberal and leftist academic circles in Japan have
started to criticize me. They say: 'Toshiya changed a lot. He abandoned
social movements, cyber cultures and media politics.' But that's not true.
These days I am much more involved in cultural politics, the politics of the
everyday life than ever before. Through rave culture I am encountering a
variety of urban tribes.

GL: Aren't you overestimating the political dimension of the rave phenomena?

TU: Most of the ravers are apolitical and lack consciousness about political
issues. For instance, they don't care about Japan's colonial and imperial
past. On the other hand it is very interesting that some of young trance
tribes are negotiating with capital or globalization in their own way when
they have to manufacture fashion gear. They don't have a political agenda
but they somehow have tactics to survive or to make money in their
relationship with Japan's former colonies such as Korea and Taiwan. They
don't deny their eventual political agency concerning topics such as ecology
and the pirate (gift) economy. As a dissident sociologist I would like to
construct a political practice with these urban rave tribes in order to
develop tribal solidarity in Inter-East connections through various
subcultures and build bridges between Japan, Korea, Taiwan and even China.
In other words, rather than being crazy about a reflection and redemptive
consciousness on the Japanese colonial and imperial past, I would like to
create something positive together with ravers, urban tribes and also youths
and people in ex-(or post) colonial Asia. I have to say that the leftist
'authentic' and 'liberal' position in Japanese academia is failing to grasp
such alternative possibilities. They tend to be too 'moralistic' by seeing
history and past only in a regrettable way. I am sure that there is a
similar pattern in former Yugoslavia. If the Croats for instance insist on
their 'most-victim status' then you can not invent something positive or
productive in tribal solidarity with others, for example with Bosnians or
Serbs.

GL: What do you think of the current I-mode fashion in Japan? Is there any
reason for Westerners to be excited or even jealous about the Japanese
wireless craze and DoCoMo in particular?

TU: Certainly all of my students and the party tribes are all using mobile
phones to communicate, make appointments and sometimes to get a bit of info.
But I can't find any reason why westerners should be jealous about their
Japanese counterparts. Concerning tactical use of mobile gear I can point to
more interesting and crazy usage in Europe. Nowadays even for most dissident
punks and squatters handies are really helpful technological tools. Some DJs
and organizers in Japan started to distribute tracks via wireless networks.
At the same time they are also are thinking about how to hook up mobile
phones with MIDI instruments. Even though all this supports capitalist
telecom corporations, these experiments could be really revolutionary.

GL: How would you describe Internet use amongst young people in Japan? It is
being said that they're not so interested. They are much more crazy about
wireless applications and more protected, intimate BBS systems. Is the
English language an obstacle to communicate? Cybercafes and public terminals
aren't that popular compared to for instance Australia, Asia or Latin
America.

TU: Japanese youth are not so crazy about Internet, as far as I see,
certainly not my students and the tribes around me. The aim and the way of
using the Internet are quite different. They are all the time net-surfing
but mainly visit Japanese sites. They are also quite skillful using
computers to edit sounds and moving pictures. The web design scene is also
powerful but always lacks  content, especially political and theoretical
one. So relatively it is true that they prefer 'stand alone using computers'
over the Internet. There are only very few students who visit English based
sites. Language is still an obstacle, also for me. There are not so much
cybercafes in Japan because most of the people already have their own
computers in the office or at home. Of course tribes in the party scene are
more active on the Net in order to organize parties, wary of local
authorities and police to find out.

GL: Where does the 'urban tribe' concept come from? Don't you see it as a
set back to go back to such an anthropological term, so close to ethnicity
where there no longer is any ethnicity? Why would rave cultures be best
described as 'urban tribes'?

TU: The term 'tribe' was not invented by myself. For this I have to go back
to Japan of 1955. One author published a novel titled Season of the Sun. It
was a bestseller. It told the story of hedonistic subculture youth and
caused a sensation in those days. A film was based on the novel.
Increasingly that type of youth style out of the novel could be found
everywhere because youth were trying to imitate the style and fashion
described in Season of the Sun. Of course, this novel was inspired by the
real youth of these days. And then a term was invented: 'sun tribe'. People
used to call the dissident, hedonistic youth during the fifties the sun
tribe (taiyo-zoku). After that in each period, 60s, 70s, 80s, mainstream
press and parent cultures always used the term zoku to describe unknown
youth subcultures. For example otaku-zoku, crystal-tribes (Japanese yuppies
in 80s) or the speed bike tribes.
Japanese are crazy about the generation gap phenomena, perhaps because we
don't have visible markers amongst people. 5 or 6 years difference is
already important for people. Japanese youth are very sensitive about age.
Since the 90s this symptom is slowly changing. Maybe the otaki-zoku was the
last tribe in Japan. Because people tried to use another term, kei, it is
very difficult to translate - system or series. So, for instance,
Shibuya-kei, Shibuya-series in English. Shibuya is the name of the district
of Tokyo, one of youth centers in the city. So people would like to call the
music genre and some fashion based on the youth in Shibuya, Shibuya-kei.
Nobody these days is using the term 'tribe' anymore. But at the same time
there are a lot using the term tribe or tribal in flyers for club and rave
party to connote new types of music genres and specific atmosphere.
Another interesting point is that the author of the Season of the Sun later
became a politician in the parliament in the LDP - the dominant
liberal-democratic party. He is now governor of the Tokyo metropolis and
perhaps the only mayor who rejected to give the human rights to gay people
or to give rights to foreigners to be able to vote. He's a real fascist or
at least can be called a fanatic nationalist and historical revisionist. He
is constantly denying Japan's colonial violent past. He once called Asians
'third people'. Japanese would be first, Americans and the westerners
second. According to him people from other Asian countries such as migrant
workers or students should be discriminated. This is a really crazy
situation. Why did this man become so powerful? Because people supported
him. In that way zoku and the story of tribes is not only based on
sub-cultural studies, it is deeply related to Japanese politics. Recently
the son of Prime Minister Koizumi, who is also populist, neo-liberal,
started appearing as an actor. Despite of the poor result, he gave an
audition with the title '21st century Yujiro' (Ishihara's dead brother).
Such phenomena are interesting, ironical and crucial for Japanese populism
and conservative cultural politics.
In Japan the term 'tribe' has had a specific meaning. In the late 40's in
Osaka, the second biggest city in Japan, there were squat villages, squat
towns of Korean residents. They were very much discriminated. In those
villages there was a lot of scrap of steel underground. They tried to dig up
this scrap and get money by selling it. But this scrap was the national
property of Japanese national government. And then the conflict between the
police and the Korean residents started. It made a sensation in those days.
These Korean residents called themselves the 'Apache tribe.' They compared
their position with native-American. Numerous authors and novelists wrote
the novel featuring this 'Apache tribe.' One of them was an SF called
Japanese Apache Tribe, written by Sakyo Komatsu, in which Apache tribe
appeared as a mutant having iron body something like cyborg or T-1000 in
Terminator 2. It is a well-known fact that this novel influenced the
underground cult movie Testuo. I am sure that some SF freaks or club techno
tribes regard this film as a legendary piece.

GL: You have been working with the 'digital diaspora' concept. Could you
explain this? To what extend would you support a withdrawal into the Net?
Could we speak of productive monads and where does this inward looking
become eccentric and obsessive otaku-ism? You have been critical of the
figure of the otaku and the Western fascination for this so-called typical
Japanese obsessive behavior of the 'otaku' data collector. Where does a
sub-culture in Japan have possibilities for resistance, and at what point do
'temporary autonomous zones' transform into consumer-driven lifestyles?

TU: By using the term digital diaspora I don't mean the disappearance of
human lives and bodies into the Net. Rather, I use it to talk about a
diaspora within the Net (or generated through the Net). Historically
diaspora cultures can be found around the world. Some theoreticians working
on the diaspora topic have used the term of web or network. The term
'diaspora web' was introduced by Paul Gilroy. These days this terminology is
no longer a mere metaphor but rather a sort of allegory for the reality
itself to which we are faced up. We are now faced with broader cyberspaces
through network technology. Not only due to computers but also via radio or
telephones the information 'seas' have been expanding. Not only through the
power of Internet, actually some refugees and people in diaspora began to
keep their lives in diaspora through video distributions or computer
networks and other electronic technologies. One could mention refugee
communities in Perth (Australia) coming from Croatia or Macedonia. They are
using VCR technology to maintain the relationship to their original place.
And also one can put as example, some independent media in Amsterdam to
support people coming from ex-Yugoslavia, (as described in Dona Kolar-Panov,
Video, War and the Diasporic Imagination, Routledge,1997). Information
technology and telecommunications are developing the diaspora notion into
new directions.

Diaspora in general is connected to moving and migration forced by some
power relations including economic, political, religious and so on. To
describe the things and the cultural elements moved, like dreadlocks,
T-shirts, and music etc, one can appropriate the term cultural diaspora to
interpret such a circulation. Certainly diaspora is a sort of cultural
traveling and causes traveling theory, but it should not be confused with
globalization in general or postmodern pastiche eclecticism which is based
on the 'anything goes' parameter. But on the other hand it is becoming
difficult to maintain the dichotomy between real refugees, illegal migrants,
asylum people, 'suffered diaspora,' ravers, hooligans, travelers, tourists
and the 'cultural diaspora.' It is becoming difficult to distinguish forced
settlement and voluntary migration, dwelling and traveling in a rigid way.
We, I mean critic or intellectuals in the 'first world', are in between the
'suffered' and the 'observer'. Diaspora is crucial tactical tool and even
medium or space to analyze this situation.

GL: What does the diaspora condition got to do with the specific Japanese
'otaku' phenomena, the manic collectors of instance records, magazines and
games?

TU: In the past I have criticized the term otaku but not the otaku people
themselves. I am criticizing the cultural condition of otaku and its
political context. I myself am an otaku of sorts, being crazy about Japanese
animations and psychedelic trance techno. I am skeptical about Japanese art
based on otaku-ism. Western people are fascinated by otaku culture and
that's why it can be marketable. Some even try to emphasize the cultural
traditions and history of otaku. They say Japanese culture has always been
dominated by collectors infomania. For them Japanese history has been
postmodern and eclectic right from the start.

GL: Where does the difficulty to communicate between scenes, movements and
disciplines within Japan come from? It is striking to see how many useless
frictions and anxieties there are, between artists, scholars, institutions,
activists. This makes it rather difficult, I suppose, to set up networks in
Japan. The only communication which seem to work are the very private,
intimate channels on certain bulletin board systems (BBS). There seems to be
a form of competition, not related to work, money or income. This fact has
made it difficult to set up a half-way independent and interesting new media
arts scene in Japan. Japanese we get to meet in the West do not collaborate
in Japan. It seems much easier for them to meet in New York, Amsterdam or
Paris then in their own country. Do you believe that this is simply cultural
(as a 'second nature') and therefore next to impossible to change? Isn't it
interesting that this overdose of communication devices hasn't had a
significant impact on this specific aspect of Japanese society? Or should we
view this observation as yet another culturalism?

TU: Well, I don't want to say that there is particular inability to
communicate in Japan. I am actually highly skeptical about any form of
culturalism or cultural essentialism. But to be honest, I have also have
felt the useless frictions amongst the different urban tribes in Japan on
numerous occasions. I am fed up with that situation. That is the reason why
I am frequently staying in Europe. Maybe others also feel like that. For
instance, in Japan, media artists are generally not interested in politics
and especially not in Japanese politics. On the other hand, most of the
leftist intellectuals have never heard of media art or media activism.
Tetsuo Kogawa and Toshimaru Ogura are great exceptions of course. The former
was founder of free radio movement in Japan and still very active for
experiments of streaming and developing critical media theory. The latter is
radical media activist and theorist organizing anti-wiretap and anti-echelon
movement. In fact, I myself have not met them since long time. Tokyo is too
huge to see each other. Toshimaru is living far away from Tokyo. There is a
deep gap. Of course this gap is both cultural and political. Cultural
studies is recently becoming popular in leftist and liberal academic
circles. But most scholars reduce cultural studies to a method for
criticizing the notion of the nation state. Their arguments have never
reached younger generations or urban subcultural tribes on the streets or
scenes such as hip hop or rave, even though they could easily be against the
nation state and its cultural hegemony.
Take the example of LETS (local trading system) in Japan. That's a popular
concept at the moment amongst critical intellectuals. Koujin Karatani and
partly Akira Asada, who always prefers the 'safety zone' rather than the
real 'critical space,' are at the moment involved in organizing NAM, the New
Associatist Movement, which is a network of LETS in Japan. I support LETS,
its theory and especially its practices. Being one of the ravers and
organizers of small illegal parties I respect every form of gift-economy
style and reciprocal symbolic economy. So why don't I join NAM? Despite of
Akira and Koujin's nasty and cynical gestures towards social movements
during 80's, it is good to see what they are doing. But there is an old type
of politics at work within NAM. Karatani and others are putting out the
theory, and then people can do LETS activities according to the theorists'
system. Volunteers work within the structure elaborated by intellectuals and
theoreticians. This in my opinion points at an outdated and unnecessary
contrast between theory and practice. Their classifications on some parts in
the movement are very ironic. They call their small groups 'kei' meaning
series or system, in contrast to tribe. So you have bunka-kei (culture
series), lilon-kei (theory series), undou-kei (movement series) and so on.
It sounds like a bad joke to the subcultural urban tribes. Karatani and
Asada's take on social movements is to ignore and neglect the organic and
transversal relationships amongst different scenes.
What I am trying to do is setting up small pirate radio stations and flea
market activities during open air raves. Indeed, there is a difference in
understanding between tribes such as rave and punk and hip-hop. But that's a
much better situation than the classic binary opposition between theory and
practice. Karatani labeled NAM as a new type of communism. Probably that's
right. But he does not think about the people's reaction. By using the term
communism NAM is losing interesting people and tribes. Their way of
communication is using classic leftist language in an almost tragic-comic
way. I am familiar with it but most people are not. I wished NAM and various
urban tribes and subcultural scenes would shake hands and build an affective
and effective alliance. For that vision a cultural politics would be
crucial, a politics which communicates within the scenes rather than mere
political rhetoric. It can be called cultural politics. Technology can
change the way of communication in each cultural and political context. That
is why I restarted the pirate mini FM free radio idea during open air
parties. I would like create hybrids amongst different urban tribes such as
techno, punk, eco, anarcho, rave, new age, otaku, the left and other
dissidents.

GL: What is the current level of media theory in Japan? We don't hear much
about it. I can't think of any Japanese contemporary theory being
translated. We actually only hear about theory import into Japan, not the
other way round. Is this because there's nothing going on? This can hardy be
the case. Is the produced theory only of local interest? What's reason for
this theory deficit?

TU: There are a few tendencies within Japanese media theory. The first is
mainly developed in academic field and is called media studies. There are
some layers and spectrum goes from audience research to more positivist
methodologies. Basically researchers don't want to go outside of
universities and academic circles. Most of them are not enthusiastic to use
media technology themselves. There are a few translations or papers
available in English.
The second tendency would be a form of criticism to be found within new
media art, connected to the Internet hype and early-mid 90s media
technologies. That is why it used to have financial support from big
corporations but that's fading away. Unfortunately new media arts lacks the
vision on the broader political economy of its own field. That is why
corporations can safely speculate their money into 'speculative' media
theory .
The third tendency would be the activist 'tactical' media. But that stream
is very micro and weak in Japan. As I mentioned, Tetsuo and Toshimaru are
active in both theory and action. They are paying attention to the economy
and politics of the media and Internet. I am not that satisfied with the
theoretical level of the three currents. For most of the time I have been
moving between the three and taken difficult in-between positions. What is
crucial in this context is how we can build bridges between the different
media tribes.

GL: Over the last few years you have been going to a wide range of raves,
from illegal parties in German forests, squatters parties in Amsterdam,
raves in Zagreb to solar eclipse parties in Hungary and Zambia. You also
attend a variety of raves in Japan, from expensive Tokyo club events to
informal events in parks and in the mountains. Do you see yourself as a
modern anthropologist studying rave culture? Have you encountered any
problems with this form of 'participatory research'?

TU: There is a 'belonging without identity' as described by Gorgio Agamben
and Lawrence Grossberg which goes beyond the usual definition of community
as a social entity with shared values. Without identification on fixed and
stable positions it is possible to belong to a tribe. Tribal formation are
not one. Within one tribe we can find diverse styles, differences in taste
and even conflicts over how to live ones life. When subculturalists say '
(s)he is tribal' it means that there is an open group-minded feeling, a
solidarity and tolerance for other tribes and different styles. It point at
a consciousness against the mainstream of this civilization and its
globalization. For example, tribal cultures within the rave scene show
respect for so-called traditional tribal or quasi-premodern cultures and
their 'indigenous' way of living. This respect is so distant from the way in
which journalism and political science talk about 'tribal wars.' The
position of the DJ in all this is highly significant. The DJ functions as a
mediator and catalyst to both inform and transform people how to enter other
dimensions of the world. They could be considered the shamans of the cyber
age. But this shaman is at the same time an 'organic intellectual' in a
Gramscian sense, organizing people to get to other horizons of  society
through 'partying.'
Becoming a DJ has influenced my way of writing in many ways. Both positions,
the sociologist and the DJ consist of a cut'n'mix of materials produced by
others. Usually a DJ does not  compose or create the music tracks him or
herself. The DJ cut'n'mix is '(re)inventing' and (re)elaborating already
existing sounds. The same can be said about the work of the sociologist or
theoretician as a TJ (text jockey). We can no longer pretend to create
'theory' out of the blue. We always first collect material, texts and
resources and then start quoting, editing and appropriating passages from
past works. That is do-it-yourself within theoretical practice. Kodwo
Eshun's notion of 'remixology' is quite suggestive. Sometimes I am asking
myself: am I a sociologist or just a tribal raver? It is a really difficult
question to answer.
I don't want to merely celebrate rave culture. There are a lot of problems
such as hedonism, consumerism, drug issues, frictions amongst tribes and
organizers, negotiations with local authority and police have to made, etc.
I never face any problem during my 'participatory observation' or fieldwork
research. Maybe this is because of my enthusiasm to join the party. The
difficulty is lying somewhere else. I do not have the proper language yet to
talk to both academic circles and party tribes. It might even be impossible.
I would like to invent a different way to theorize everyday life.

Aaron,

Much of the foreign aid money sent to Afghanistan this year was part of
another unwinnable, undefinable war -- the war on drugs. That $43 million,
for example, was tied to the Taliban's "commitment" to poppy eradication.

Someone just sent me an article with this paragraph in it:

"This year, the U.S. continued a Clinton-era policy and committed more than
$100 million in foreign aid to Afghanistan -- making us the country's
largest humanitarian donor. In May, Secretary of State Colin Powell
announced an additional $43 million in relief, which includes 65,000 tons of
wheat, vegetable oil, blended foods, health programs and shelter. Naive
officials claim that none of this aid will go to the Taliban because it is
being filtered through international agencies of the United Nations and
non-governmental organizations."


Is this true?  I am as interested as anyone in knowing the facts.

I agree that we should not take any action that *in any way* would hurt the
people of Afghanistan.

Interviewing Chomsky

Radio B92, Belgrade



Why do you think these attacks happened?

To answer the question we must first identify the
perpetrators of the crimes. It is generally assumed,
plausibly, that their origin is the Middle East
region, and that the attacks probably trace back to
the Osama Bin Laden network, a widespread and complex
organization, doubtless inspired by Bin Laden but not
necessarily acting under his control. Let us assume
that this is true. Then to answer your question a
sensible person would try to ascertain Bin Laden's
views, and the sentiments of the large reservoir of
supporters he has throughout the region. About all of
this, we have a great deal of information. Bin Laden
has been interviewed extensively over the years by
highly reliable Middle East specialists, notably the
most eminent correspondent in the region, Robert Fisk
(London _Independent_), who has intimate knowledge of
the entire region and direct experience over decades.
A Saudi Arabian millionaire, Bin Laden became a
militant Islamic leader in the war to drive the
Russians out of Afghanistan. He was one of the many
religious fundamentalist extremists recruited, armed,
and financed by the CIA and their allies in Pakistani
intelligence to cause maximal harm to the Russians --
quite possibly delaying their withdrawal, many
analysts suspect -- though whether he personally
happened to have direct contact with the CIA is
unclear, and not particularly important. Not
surprisingly, the CIA preferred the most fanatic and
cruel fighters they could mobilize. The end result was
to "destroy a moderate regime and create a fanatical
one, from groups recklessly financed by the Americans"
(_London Times_ correspondent Simon Jenkins, also a
specialist on the region). These "Afghanis" as they
are called (many, like Bin Laden, not from
Afghanistan) carried out terror operations across the
border in Russia, but they terminated these after
Russia withdrew. Their war was not against Russia,
which they despise, but against the Russian occupation
and Russia's crimes against Muslims.



The "Afghanis" did not terminate their activities,
however. They joined Bosnian Muslim forces in the
Balkan Wars; the US did not object, just as it
tolerated Iranian support for them, for complex
reasons that we need not pursue here, apart from
noting that concern for the grim fate of the Bosnians
was not prominent among them. The "Afghanis" are also
fighting the Russians in Chechnya, and, quite
possibly, are involved in carrying out terrorist
attacks in Moscow and elsewhere in Russian territory.
Bin Laden and his "Afghanis" turned against the US in
1990 when they established permanent bases in Saudi
Arabia -- from his point of view, a counterpart to the
Russian occupation of Afghanistan, but far more
significant because of Saudi Arabia's special status
as the guardian of the holiest shrines.



Bin Laden is also bitterly opposed to the corrupt and
repressive regimes of the region, which he regards as
"un-Islamic," including the Saudi Arabian regime, the
most extreme Islamic fundamentalist regime in the
world, apart from the Taliban, and a close US ally
since its origins. Bin Laden despises the US for its
support of these regimes. Like others in the region,
he is also outraged by long-standing US support for
Israel's brutal military occupation, now in its 35th
year: Washington's decisive diplomatic, military, and
economic intervention in support of the killings, the
harsh and destructive siege over many years, the daily
humiliation to which Palestinians are subjected, the
expanding settlements designed to break the occupied
territories into Bantustan-like cantons and take
control of the resources, the gross violation of the
Geneva Conventions, and other actions that are
recognized as crimes throughout most of the world,
apart from the US, which has prime responsibility for
them. And like others, he contrasts Washington's
dedicated support for these crimes with the
decade-long US-British assault against the civilian
population of Iraq, which has devastated the society
and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths while
strengthening Saddam Hussein -- who was a favored
friend and ally of the US and Britain right through
his worst atrocities, including the gassing of the
Kurds, as people of the region also remember well,
even if Westerners prefer to forget the facts. These
sentiments are very widely shared. The _Wall Street
Journal_ (Sept. 14) published a survey of opinions of
wealthy and privileged Muslims in the Gulf region
(bankers, professionals, businessmen with close links
to the U.S.). They expressed much the same views:
resentment of the U.S. policies of supporting Israeli
crimes and blocking the international consensus on a
diplomatic settlement for many years while devastating
Iraqi civilian society, supporting harsh and
repressive anti-democratic regimes throughout the
region, and imposing barriers against economic
development by "propping up oppressive regimes." Among
the great majority of people suffering deep poverty
and oppression, similar sentiments are far more
bitter, and are the source of the fury and despair
that has led to suicide bombings, as commonly
understood by those who are interested in the facts.



The U.S., and much of the West, prefers a more
comforting story. To quote the lead analysis in the
_New York Times_ (Sept. 16), the perpetrators acted
out of "hatred for the values cherished in the West as
freedom, tolerance, prosperity, religious pluralism
and universal suffrage." U.S. actions are irrelevant,
and therefore need not even be mentioned (Serge
Schmemann). This is a convenient picture, and the
general stance is not unfamiliar in intellectual
history; in fact, it is close to the norm. It happens
to be completely at variance with everything we know,
but has all the merits of self-adulation and
uncritical support for power.

It is also widely recognized that Bin Laden and others
like him are praying for "a great assault on Muslim
states," which will cause "fanatics to flock to his
cause" (Jenkins, and many others.). That too is
familiar. The escalating cycle of violence is
typically welcomed by the harshest and most brutal
elements on both sides, a fact evident enough from the
recent history of the Balkans, to cite only one of
many cases.





What consequences will they have on US inner policy
and to the American self reception?

US policy has already been officially announced. The
world is being offered a "stark choice": join us, or
"face the certain prospect of death and destruction."
Congress has authorized the use of force against any
individuals or countries the President determines to
be involved in the attacks, a doctrine that every
supporter regards as ultra-criminal. That is easily
demonstrated. Simply ask how the same people would
have reacted if Nicaragua had adopted this doctrine
after the U.S. had rejected the orders of the World
Court to terminate its "unlawful use of force" against
Nicaragua and had vetoed a Security Council resolution
calling on all states to observe international law.
And that terrorist attack was far more severe and
destructive even than this atrocity.



As for how these matters are perceived here, that is
far more complex. One should bear in mind that the
media and the intellectual elites generally have their
particular agendas. Furthermore, the answer to this
question is, in significant measure, a matter of
decision: as in many other cases, with sufficient
dedication and energy, efforts to stimulate
fanaticism, blind hatred, and submission to authority
can be reversed. We all know that very well.





  Do you expect U.S. to profoundly change their policy
to the rest of the world?

The initial response was to call for intensifying the
policies that led to the fury and resentment that
provides the background of support for the terrorist
attack, and to pursue more intensively the agenda of
the most hard line elements of the leadership:
increased militarization, domestic regimentation,
attack on social programs. That is all to be expected.
Again, terror attacks, and the escalating cycle of
violence they often engender, tend to reinforce the
authority and prestige of the most harsh and
repressive elements of a society. But there is nothing
inevitable about submission to this course.





After the first shock, came fear of what the U.S.
answer is going to be. Are you afraid, too?

Every sane person should be afraid of the likely
reaction -- the one that has already been announced,
the one that probably answers Bin Laden's prayers. It
is highly likely to escalate the cycle of violence, in
the familiar way, but in this case on a far greater
scale.



The U.S. has already demanded that Pakistan terminate
the food and other supplies that are keeping at least
some of the starving and suffering people of
Afghanistan alive. If that demand is implemented,
unknown numbers of people who have not the remotest
connection to terrorism will die, possibly millions.
Let me repeat: the U.S. has demanded that Pakistan
kill possibly millions of people who are themselves
victims of the Taliban. This has nothing to do even
with revenge. It is at a far lower moral level even
than that. The significance is heightened by the fact
that this is mentioned in passing, with no comment,
and probably will hardly be noticed. We can learn a
great deal about the moral level of the reigning
intellectual culture of the West by observing the
reaction to this demand. I think we can be reasonably
confident that if the American population had the
slightest idea of what is being done in their name,
they would be utterly appalled. It would be
instructive to seek historical precedents.

If Pakistan does not agree to this and other U.S.
demands, it may come under direct attack as well --
with unknown consequences. If Pakistan does submit to
U.S. demands, it is not impossible that the government
will be overthrown by forces much like the Taliban --
who in this case will have nuclear weapons. That could
have an effect throughout the region, including the
oil producing states. At this point we are considering
the possibility of a war that may destroy much of
human society.



Even without pursuing such possibilities, the
likelihood is that an attack on Afghans will have
pretty much the effect that most analysts expect: it
will enlist great numbers of others to support of Bin
Laden, as he hopes. Even if he is killed, it will make
little difference. His voice will be heard on
cassettes that are distributed throughout the Islamic
world, and he is likely to be revered as a martyr,
inspiring others. It is worth bearing in mind that one
suicide bombing -- a truck driven into a U.S. military
base -- drove the world's major military force out of
Lebanon 20 years ago. The opportunities for such
attacks are endless. And suicide attacks are very hard
to prevent.





"The world will never be the same after 11.09.01". Do
you think so?

The horrendous terrorist attacks on Tuesday are
something quite new in world affairs, not in their
scale and character, but in the target. For the US,
this is the first time since the War of 1812 that its
national territory has been under attack, even threat.
It's colonies have been attacked, but not the national
territory itself. During these years the US virtually
exterminated the indigenous population, conquered half
of Mexico, intervened violently in the surrounding
region, conquered Hawaii and the Philippines (killing
hundreds of thousands of Filipinos), and in the past
half century particularly, extended its resort to
force throughout much of the world. The number of
victims is colossal. For the first time, the guns have
been directed the other way. The same is true, even
more dramatically, of Europe. Europe has suffered
murderous destruction, but from internal wars,
meanwhile conquering much of the world with extreme
brutality. It has not been under attack by its victims
outside, with rare exceptions (the IRA in England, for
example). It is therefore natural that NATO should
rally to the support of the US; hundreds of years of
imperial violence have an enormous impact on the
intellectual and moral culture.



It is correct to say that this is a novel event in
world history, not because of the scale of the
atrocity -- regrettably -- but because of the target.
How the West chooses to react is a matter of supreme
importance. If the rich and powerful choose to keep to
their traditions of hundreds of years and resort to
extreme violence, they will contribute to the
escalation of a cycle of violence, in a familiar
dynamic, with long-term consequences that could be
awesome. Of course, that is by no means inevitable. An
aroused public within the more free and democratic
societies can direct policies towards a much more
humane and honorable course.

There's a wonderful line in Adrienne Rich's _Atlas of the Difficult World_,
Kasey, to the effect that "a patriot is not a missile."  She wrote in
response to the Gulf War.

While I'm here, let me say that I've been very moved by the religious
outpourings of the past week. I've attended two very crowded Buddhist
services and watched some of the ecumenical services shown on television.
We oughtn't to confuse religious/spiritual feeling with "crusade" or
"extremism," except where that is what it is (Falwell and Robertson).  I was
impressed at the moderation of the services, the way in which they addressed
the need to grieve rather than the desire for revenge.  As ritual, I think
they've been extremely important.

Thanks to everyone for their words.

aloha, Susan

I mean face an episode in which what we believed to be true turned out not
to be and take from that experience a greater depth of awareness at a time
when we are so easily inflamed by what we 'know' about current events.  I do
not mean we should start circulating misinformation.

Subject:      gender & war (& Arafat)
Mime-Version: 1.0

Camille, thank you for bringing up many issues, including those of sexuality
and gender. I have refrained all week from remarks that might alienate the
opposite sex, because we all need each other perhaps now more than ever, but
it is impossible to ignore (or accept) the fact that there are so many male
public voices now and so few female. I walked to church with my Mom on
Sunday afternoon and we lit candles for Mary. There was a mass going on but
I couldn't stand to listen to one more man at a podium.

The Taliban bears similarity to the forces within the US that helped get
Bush to power. Cf particularly that extremist US Christian group (name
escapes me) that is calling for a return to women submitting/surrendering to
their husbands/fathers. And getting stadium crowds last I heard. (The blame
for these turns of events does not lie solely with the males of the species
I might add.)

These days of really feeling the possibility of the collapse of sanity (not
to mention existence!) on a world wide level, the possible end of the world,
at least for humans, ---- to me this is in part brought on by the misogyny
of the most powerful religions and governments and men in the (current)
world, as well as the misogyny closer to home, even that which I carry
within myself, marked as we each are by my own culture and experience. This
strikes me.

With all respect to Marjorie Perloff, and I have a lot, the forwarded
comment about Arafat disturbed me. I may have read it as a bit gleeful when
it wasn't at all intended in that way, but I would just like to add as a
counterbalance that I have felt nothing but sympathy for Arafat this week,
as a man and a tired longtime leader. My prayers are with he and with Sharon
in hopes that they can both act reasonable and with an eye toward the large
picture, one which is very much larger than who in a small geographical area
can or can't stand their neighbors.

And one which is very much larger than any "superpower", "satanic" or
otherwise.

My love and hope to all,
plants and animals very included,

Elizabeth

PS Also on Sunday, one of my dearest friends was at the park with her
toddler when a news crew showed up. "They wanted a mother to say she was
against war," she reported to me in her trademark quizzical manner, and said
that she had obliged. Of course she along with all of us knows it is more
complicated than that.

Ron,

Much of what you've written here goes straight to the heart of our current
dilemma. I too am distressed by the pious hand-wringing of much of the left.
I too find the posture of self-reflection an inaequate response -- though a
necessary component of any adequate response: not the question "why?" as if
it explained the attacks away, but the question "how?" as in "How did this
happen, and what actions on our part will best prevent its happening again?"
And any such question necessarily includes an understanding of failed U.S.
policy in the Middle East and southwest Asia. Not as background, but as
prospect: we must learn how not to repeat ourselves.

Your remarks on solidarity, on the room for contact and coalition within the
charged symbolism of the flag, are well taken. On a personal note, Nick's
posting got me to talk to my downstairs neighbors, who have bedecked our
building's front entrance with the largest flag on the block, one so
oversized it literally slaps me in the face as I come up the steps. I guess
you can detect my ambivalence in that description. But you and Nick are
right, there's room for a constructive encounter in that symbolic space. So
I talked to them a bit, and as it turns out, for them at least it stands for
exactly what I feared it did. (At one point the phrase "turn Kabul into a
crater" came up). Since then, though, I've found out that this is not
universally the case on my block, in my neighborhood, in my city. We're all
having to learn quickly to keep our knees from jerking.

And you are absolutely right that any response from the left has to organize
itself around an acknowledgement of the inevitability of the use of force,
and that sadly much of the response up to this moment has not. But I
question the way you map the distinction between these poles of action and
inaction onto that between seeing the attack as a crime vs. seeing it as an
act of war. I don't think that many of those who hold to the former position
are so benighted as to really believe that such a criminal investigation and
prosecution could be pursued without the use of significant military force.

The question for us is "what kind of force," and "held to what standards of
accountability." The problem with a declaration of war, and especially with
the Bush resolution, as you yourself point out, is that states like the U.S.
know how to declare war on other states, not on rhizomic transnational
networks. So our first step is one of surrogation. And if that doesn't make
the whole enterprise "a war that is a surrogate for a solution," it
certainly drags us pretty far in that direction. Add to that the
consideration that this administration, and the national security apparatus
at its heart, is committed to a particular kind of state-to-state warfare
involving direct military assaults on civilians and economic blockades to
"starve out" those left standing after the bombs have fallen. And then add
to that the consideration that one of the first responses from the White
House and the intelligence world was the assertion that we needed to put
human-rights violators back on the CIA payroll (well, at least "back on the
payroll" in the publicly acknowledged sense), and lift our ban on
extra-judicial executions, and I think you get some inkling of why many of
us are looking for an alternative to war. It's not simply that the Bush
administration and its electronic media allies have a headlock on the
rhetoric of war -- though that's an important consideration. It's also that
our material apparatus of war is geared to produce exactly such a conflict.

I suppose what I'm saying here is that you might be right. The appeal to
criminal justice and international law (and especially the rescue of bodies
of international law from their currently underdeveloped (deliberately, by
us) state) might be quixotic, might in fact be unrealistic "pussyfooting."
But I fear it's no less unrealistic to rely on our ability to effectively
argue into place a rhetoric and machinery of war that refrains from killing
civilians, that doesn't target states as surrogates for non-state
organizations, and that doesn't simply continue by overwhelming force the
last half-century of failed U.S. policy -- and to do all this arguing and
constructing in the next few days, before the bombs start falling and the
blockades are fully in place.

Given such a situation, I don't think it's surprising that many on the left
are simply yelling "stop." Is this an adequate response? No, you're right
about that. And you're right that our dissent shouldn't lead off with
"background," "wherefores," and mitigations. We do need to begin with the
acknowledgement that something _must_ be done. Starting from precisely that
position, though, is what leads me to the argument that the Bush war plan is
perhaps the _worst_ way to accomplish everyone's goal, which is to make sure
those immediately responsible are unable to launch another such attack (or
something worse), and to greatly lessen the possibility of similar horrors
in the future. And the difficulty we face in such a position is that, given
the swiftly manufactured consensus, any criticism of the President's
"unlimited use of force" atuhorization is seen as opposition to the use of
force as such. Unfortunately, the corollary seems to be that declaring
ourselves _for_ war commits us to that resolution pre-emptively.

If we had our choice of wars, I might find myself in closer agreement with
you. But right now I think we only have the one, and getting ourselves clear
of it isn't simply a matter of arguing for policy changes, but of
fundamentally reorienting a massive material apparatus along entirely
different lines. It's a goal worth having, but I don't think it'll be
accomplished in time to wage _this_ war along those lines.

On a personal note again, I think of my younger brother, finishing his USMC
combat training at the naval base in Pensacola, and about to be swept up in
this war. He's an adult (though barely), and he made his choice to enlist
late last year -- along with a disproportionate share of the young men from
the neighborhood where I grew up, which was effectively bypassed by the 90's
"boom," and hit harder than most by the recent "corrections." I think I can
live with his choice, and theirs, though it's hard. I think I can bring
myself at least to acknowledge that they will put themselves at risk, and
some of them might die, because of this choice. But if that risk, and those
possible deaths, are in the service of nothing better than the counterposing
of wholesale terror against retail terror, I think it will break me. And I
think it will break this country.

Peace,
Taylor

Subject: What is to be done


I've been thinking for days about how best to write this - and I still have
no clue, so I'm just going to wade in and hope for the best. I've been asked
what I think about "all this" by some two dozen people, and what I think is
this.

It is time for progressives to act, but not on the past dragged on as habit.

The horrific attack on four jetliners, the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon last week places everybody under extraordinary kinds of pressure
right now - I must have seen one hundred or so American males openly cry on
television over the past week (and even Bush barely kept it together when a
reporter in the Oval Office asked him about his feelings). The attack places
progressives into a particularly difficult and painful spot. So far, my
impression is that the left as a whole has not responded well and is mostly
doing a bang-up job of isolating itself at the worst possible moment in
history.

The argument that a U.S.-led coalition, or even the U.S. on its own, should
not respond militarily to the death of over 5,000 people, all but a hundred
or so of them civilians, is based on premises that reveal an absolute
inability to look at the circumstances directly. Instead, people seem to be
continuing on some mode of automatic pilot that is well-intended, but
ultimately self-defeating. The present situation is qualitatively different
from the Vietnam War or Desert Storm. To pretend otherwise and to trot out
the same old slogans is itself potentially a disaster from which the left
may not soon recover. To quote the subhead of Richard Sennett's excellent
article in yesterday's Guardian, "The traditional left-right dispute is
irrelevant to these abnormal times."
(http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,554037,00.html) To focus
exclusively on what the U.S. might (and may well) do wrong in responding to
the attack is to miss the point so completely that it is going to be
difficult, if not impossible, later on, to be taken seriously. That is what
I think is at stake.

Consider these points:

(1) Everyone has had the opportunity to see over 5,000 people, most of them
the most ordinary folks in the world, die very horrible deaths. This total
is more than the attack on Pearl Harbor and the sinking of the Titanic
combined - this is a visceral shock to the system that we will all be
suffering effects from for years.

(2) What would happen to any government that did NOT respond militarily to
such an attack on civilians on its soil? Frankly, it would collapse. Bush
would be impeached or worse. Politicians are for the most part followers,
craven followers at that, and the reaction by the professional pols has been
completely predictable.

(3) Does anybody anywhere honestly think that this network, whether or not
we inscribe bin Laden's name in as the CEO,  will not, at some future
moment, do something as bad or worse if it is not broken up? Do we not think
that it would use a nuclear weapon if it had a chance? Anthrax?

(4) Does anybody honestly think that if America were to somehow "improve its
behavior" toward people of the Third World, that this would eliminate the
impetus behind these attacks? That it could do so quickly enough to
forestall future assaults?

(5)  Does anybody honestly think that the U.S. could do # 3 without
literally abandoning Israel?

(6) Can anybody here imagine a U.S. electoral politician advocating some
version of #4? See that last comment under #1 again.

(7) Even if those last three points were politically do-able in the near
future, is there anybody who cannot imagine what THAT  ensuing war would
look like?

This, it seems to me, is the double-bind of this situation. And that is why
I find it so personally painful right now to be a left pacifist, which I
still am.

Hal Meyerson, the longtime Papa Bear of the Los Angeles democratic left who
is now the executive editor of The American Prospect, put it very succinctly
when he noted last week that there really are no legitimate reasons to go to
war except when somebody decides to go to war against you - and in this case
someone very definitely has.
(http://www.prospect.org/webfeatures/2001/09/meyerson-h-2.html)

In the face of all this, to argue against the use of force in breaking up
the network of terrorist cells is to confess that one is not only tone deaf
to the popular will, manipulated or otherwise (and I suspect, frankly, that
the media, like the pols, is much more a follower than a leader in this), it
is even wrong in terms of the protection of Americans. To the extent that
the American left and its allies puts its eggs into this basket, it is going
to find itself with very little credibility remaining with which to make the
far more crucial arguments that need to be made right now.

This is especially true since the folks running the American government, and
thus the American campaign - thanks again, Ralph Nader - are the worst
possible people to have in power at this historical moment.

What makes them the worst possible people, besides the obvious, is the
unique problem of this point in history. Presuming, as I do here, that force
is inevitable, the real questions that must be confronted are what force,
against whom, and how? Traditional military strategy argues that one
identifies the center of gravity of one's opponent and attacks that. In a
typical war, that usually means taking out some country's infrastructure so
that it lacks the means to sustain itself and fight back.

Even George W. Bush recognizes that this loose coalition of activist cells
that he characterizes as a terrorist network is not "some country." Not only
does al-Qaeda and its affiliates lack the trappings of statehood and the
infrastructure that normally accrue with that, this coalition has been
consciously built - a progression that can be traced back to the use of
cells by Algerian revolutionaries in the 1950s - so as not to have any true
center of gravity. It's a rhizome, almost like the point-to-point computing
model one associates with post-Napster MP3 ripping, while the U.S. military'
s experience is telling it to hunt for a mainframe somewhere.

The whole reason that Bush et al have spent so much time talking about the
"states that harbor and sponsor" al-Qaeda is because the U.S. military knows
how to attack a state. It is far less ready to go after something that doesn
't really have a head. In fact, what the U.S. media campaign has done with
bin Laden has been to build up his reputation simply to make of him a
feasible personal target. While bin Laden's individual wealth has been of
real value in giving these groups the time, leisure and resources to train,
plan and execute "martyr operations," there is thus far (9/18) relatively
little evidence that bin Laden himself did anything more direct with regards
to this particular tragedy.

Lets presume, for a moment, that the U.S. manages to capture or kill bin
Laden and even to force the downfall of the Taliban (which would have a
beneficial impact for the people of Afghanistan, especially women). Does
anybody think that this means that this network would not be able to find
resources elsewhere to continue figuring out ways to attack the United
States and global capitalism generally? Hardly.

So what I fear most is a god-awful bloody and useless war that leaves nobody
any safer than they are today. What I fear is a war that is a surrogate for
a solution. And we can't afford to not solve this quandary. The collapse of
the towers has raised the ante amid the terrorists markedly. The next
assault will almost have to be nuclear or biological even to get our
media-weary attention.

This is where the left has a role that it can and must play for the good of
all. Progressives need to focus on the necessity of the U.S.

(1) proving itself to be better than terrorists by not targeting civilians,

(2) seriously educating the American population on the sources of resentment
that the U.S. (and especially U.S. capital) generates worldwide,

(3) keeping totalitarian forces in the U.S. from deleting the Bill of Rights
in the name of security,

(4) acknowledging that embargoes only punish the poor and reversing this
long-term "containment" strategy once and for all, not just in Iraq but
everywhere,

(5) raising the issue of the need for a true solution of the "Palestine
problem" (it's not the only festering sore of U.S. foreign policy, just the
most blatant one in that region),

(6) protecting American citizens and residents both from North Africa, the
Middle East and South Asia from racist reprisals,

(7) dealing with all the important ancillary issues that accompany these
questions,

(8) raising the issue of dictatorship with all our "allies," and

(9) taking control of globalization away from multinational corporations.

If the left can address these, with focus and intelligence, it potentially
can have a shaping influence on the outcome of this struggle. That role
could prove to be far more important even than the one that progressives had
in ending the conflict in Indochina a generation ago.

But progressives can do this only if we retain some semblance of
credibility. To take any position that can be perceived as inaction in the
face of the enormous physical and emotional wound that confronts the
American people serves only to exacerbate the reputation of the left as a
movement completely out of touch with reality. Julian Borger, also writing
in The Guardian
(http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,553876,00.html)
, gets it right when he argues against the idea that "Americans should be
asking themselves why this happened to them . . . . Rather than getting
angry, then, they should be meditating and wondering what they have done
wrong.

"This point of view seems to me to be detached to the point of inhumanity.
Moreover, it is driven by an internal logic that is utterly bogus. That
logic, insinuated between the lines, suggests that the horror visited on
thousands of New Yorkers must be balanced somewhere by an equal and opposite
evil that the US has inflicted upon someone else."

Borger is correct in acknowledging that that position fails to acknowledge
the enormity of the assault. It will certainly be rejected by a huge
majority of people. As it should be. And that position also fails to address
the ugly reality that, without action, future attacks are inevitable, and
that the death toll in the towers has raised the bar for ambitious future
martyrs.

Nick Piombino's post to this list on the flag's role not as an icon of war
mongering, but as a transitional object in the grieving process, makes
perfect sense to me. I've been struck at how radically differently it has
been used in the past week than, say, the yellow ribbon campaign during the
Gulf War, a soft swastika if ever there was one. If anything, the flag's
role this time around has been one of solidarity, an emblem not of the state
but of the people. Coming out of the Vietnam experience, I never thought I
would see the stars & stripes used that way. But there it is. And it's
everywhere.

This solidarity is a unique and probably temporary phenomenon. It is
certainly something that the left needs to address and to examine. But a
movement that surrenders its credibility by pretending that the murder of
more than 5,000 people doesn't warrant a response, or which pussyfoots
around the issue by reframing the assault as "criminal" rather than as an
act of war, will have silenced itself before it has ever had the chance to
speak.

Who did it? Foreign Report presents an alternative view


http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/fr/fr010919_1_n.shtml

Israel's military intelligence service, Aman, suspects that Iraq is the
state that sponsored the suicide attacks on the New York Trade Center and
the Pentagon in Washington. Directing the mission, Aman officers believe,
were two of the world's foremost terrorist masterminds: the Lebanese Imad
Mughniyeh, head of the special overseas operations for Hizbullah, and the
Egyptian Dr Ayman Al Zawahiri, senior member of Al-Qaeda and possible
successor of the ailing Osama Bin Laden.

The two men have not been seen for some time. Mughniyeh is probably the
world's most wanted outlaw. Unconfirmed reports in Beirut say he has
undergone plastic surgery and is unrecognisable. Zawahiri is thought to be
based in Egypt. He could be Bin Laden's chief representative outside
Afghanistan.

The Iraqis, who for several years paid smaller groups to do their dirty
work, were quick to discover the advantages of Al-Qaeda. The Israeli
sources claim that for the past two years Iraqi intelligence officers were
shuttling between Baghdad and Afghanistan, meeting with Ayman Al Zawahiri.
According to the sources, one of the Iraqi intelligence officers, Salah
Suleiman, was captured last October by the Pakistanis near the border with
Afghanistan. The Iraqis are also reported to have established strong ties
with Imad Mughniyeh.

"We've only got scraps of information, not the full picture," admits one
intelligence source, "but it was good enough for us to send a warning six
weeks ago to our allies that an unprecedented massive terror attack was
expected. One of our indications suggested that Imad Mughniyeh met with
some of his dormant agents on secret trips to Germany. We believe that the
operational brains behind the New-York attack were Mughniyeh and Zawahiri,
who were probably financed and got some logistical support from the Iraqi
Intelligence Service (SSO)."

Mughniyeh was the only one believed to have tried it before. On April 12th
1997, he was reported to be only two hours away from achieving the highest
goal of any terrorist organisation (until last week): blowing up an Israeli
El-Al airliner above Tel Aviv. A man carrying a forged British passport
with the name Andrew Jonathan Neumann was in a Jerusalem hotel preparing a
bomb he was supposed to take on board an El-Al flight leaving Israel, when
it accidentally went off. Andrew Jonathan Neumann was very badly injured
but strong enough to reveal later to the Israelis that he was not British
but Lebanese, and that his operation was supposed to be a special "gift" to
Israel from Imad Mughniyeh.

'A psychopath'

"Bin Laden is a schoolboy in comparison with Mughniyeh," says an Israeli
who knows Mughniyeh . "The guy is a genius, someone who refined the art of
terrorism to its utmost level. We studied him and reached the conclusion
that he is a clinical psychopath motivated by uncontrollable psychological
reasons, which we have given up trying to understand. The killing of his
two brothers by the Americans only inflamed his strong motivation."

Experts on Iraq and Saddam Hussein also believe that Iraq was the state
behind the two terror masterminds. "In recent months, there was a change,
and Iraq decided to get into the terror business. On July 7th, they tried
for the first time to send a suicide bomber, trained in Baghdad, to blow up
Tel Aviv airport (Foreign Report No. 2651)."

Our sources believe that it will be very difficult to get to the bottom of
this unprecedented terror operation. However, they believe the chief of the
Iraqi SSO is Qusai Hussein, the dictator's son, and his organisation is the
most likely to have been involved.

Mughniyeh, 48, is a "sick man", says an intelligence officer who was in
charge of his file. He is considered by Western intelligence agencies as
the most dangerous active terrorist today. He is wanted by several
governments and the Americans have put a $2m reward on his head.

[Detailed list of Mughniyeh operations removed for Non-Subscriber Extract]

It was the assassination of one man in March 1984 that is said to have made
Mughniyeh the CIA's most wanted terrorist. Mughniyeh allegedly kidnapped
the head of the CIA station in Beirut, William Buckley. The kidnapping
triggered what later became known as 'Irangate', when the Americans tried
to exchange Buckley (and others) with arms for Iran. However, the attempt
ended in a fiasco. By one unconfirmed account, Mughniyeh tortured and
killed Buckley with his own hands.

A year later, in a combined CIA/Mossad operation, a powerful car bomb went
off at the entrance to the house of Hizbullah's spiritual leader, Sheikh
Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah. Seventy-five people were killed. One of them
was his brother. Hunted by the CIA and the Mossad, Mughniyeh hid in Iran.

In February 1992, Israeli helicopter gunships attacked the convoy of the
then head of Hizbullah, Sheikh Abas Musawi, in South Lebanon. Musawi, his
wife and children were killed and the revenge attack followed a month
later. According to press reports, Mughniyeh was called back into action
and, in a well-planned and devastating attack, his people blew up the
Israeli embassy in Argentina. The building was demolished and 92 were
killed. Only last year, after a long investigation, did Argentina issue a
warrant for Mughniyeh's arrest.

The reprisal for the attack in Argentina came in December 1994, when a car
bomb went off in a southern Shi'ite suburb of Beirut. Four people were
killed. One of them was called Mughniyeh, but to the deep disappointment of
those Israelis who planted the bomb it was the wrong one. Mughniyeh's life
was saved, but his other brother Fuad was killed. Mughniyeh waited for his
opportunity for revenge.

Our Israeli sources claim to see Mughniyeh's signature on the wreckage in
New York and Washington. How to counter this kind of terrorism? "To fight
these bastards you don't need a military attack," said an experienced
Israeli commando officer. "You only need to adopt Israel's assassination
policy."

Hi,

Actually, regarding the "jubilation" footage, now confirmed to indeed
have been shot on 9/11 in Palestine, I have heard that reporters are now
refused access to the centre of Amman, Jordan, as the authorities are
fearful that footage like that shot in Palestine, much circulated, might
be exposed to the world and embarrass the Jordanian government. So there
is an obvious worry among this government, at least, that there might be
a very palpable extremist reaction to 9/11 circulating openly and
destabilizing what is already a tense environment.

Maria,
      I am encouraged that at least until now, Bush and others, have moved
out of the isolationalist trap he was caught in.  He does seem to realize
the importance of getting out of the nationalist rhetoric and asking for
help is a big step here.

Kasey,
   Nicely said.  I do think that any new conception of "Patriot" must
include an admission of grief for past errors.  As Nick, I'm sure would
agree, psychological revival and growth if it is to bring renewal must
include this step.

Handwritten Press has 2 new books, which would have been announced last
week if not for the passivity rendered unto possible announcers by
proximity to such a violent catastrophe.  woof.


#1  ---   MORNING CONSTITUTIONAL, by Michael Magee

Place -- under arrest, outside the Ben Franklin House, a bit of declarative
rhetoric echoing past the old psych ward, a decaying neighborhood, jazz
struggling, the Amerinesiac that must needs awaken and feel its limbs. "The
untimely state's AM radio" getting played here, detuned and refracted
through Magee's acute sense of history and hearing.  Here that?  Michael
Magee's poetry, "buzzes with the legislative, polemical and liberatory
static of American political history" (K. Silem Mohammed).  This buzzing
refracts to us from the highway to the needle exchange, the monument to the
bus stop.  Magee is one of the most well-informed American poet-listeners.
Bob Perelman says "his poems sound out the present tense histories and
provide democratic key signatures so different people can play their
meanings at once.  We hear about a better place -- all the time, if we
listen.  But getting there is not an automatic thing.  These poems help."
Or as Heather Fuller writes, "This is not your ordinary peripateticism.
For what Michael has tapped into is the psychotic tyranny of the
antecedent, in which everything is thing, everyone is they, and all else is
it, and this is how it is."

"a high fidelity
version of me staple-gunned"

88 pp. perfect bound, cover art by Mitchell Magee, $10.95.  Order from
http://spdbooks.org

for a preview (based on chapbook by the same title) see
http://handwritten.org/auth/magee



#2    ---    IL JOM OH, by Ikhyun (Ike) Kim

"Il jom oh" is Korean for "1.5" -- "1.5" being an Asian-American term for
people born in their native country but living in the US since they were
little kids.  They are considered the 1.5 generation.  The poems in Kim's
book bring together the pieces of his writing which focus on Korean culture
and history, Korean and American collisions, intesections, crossings, and
conflicts. Historically and poltically grounded, these poems provide a
poetic facticity that is often always already theory, overlapping
languages, sounds, facts, and incidents with clarity and grace, clear
perception.  His poem "Two Days" (which we have placed in newspaper format
on a large foldout middle page) makes poetry of three days of news,
creating a dynamic adjacency of what usually comes through as simply the
"elsewheres" where violent policy, history, upheaval seem to always be
happening.  The title itself is a lie, aware of the lie we absorb in media
inundation and the dulling of attention induced by such absorption.
Through these kinds of adjacency, time, space and identity collapse several
times in this book.  A pointed read after the pure event of 9/11.

61 pp, handsewn Japanese binding, $10, 4.5" x 7.25".  Handmade paper cover
& interior artwork by Clare Ecstasy Seaton.

We hope to have the book up on the handwritten.org site within a few days.
I'll alert you again when it is.  To order, backchannel me to inquire.

PEACE TO ALL.

Ron, I agree with much of what you say, with a heavy heart. War does seem to
be inevitable in some measure given these attacks. However I think both left
and right, and in fact everyone I've talked to, is rethinking dearly (or
simply habitually) held beliefs in the face of this situation. I think it is
what we all must do now. We must all, all, respond with humanity and some
measure of grace, because times as you say are different. Looking to the
history of the Vietnam war (& the struggle to end it) is no more helpful
than looking at the history of WW2 to help us at this time. I think the
activists of the 1960s are more stuck in that mentality than people of my
age. I don't mean to offend, simply observe. We've grown up in a world that
never made sense on any level -- I was stunned once seeing old footage of
Eisenhower speaking as if the citizenry was intelligent -- my first big
memory of politics on TV was Mr. Haig saying "I'm in charge!" when Reagan
was shot. That, if anything, is what this moment reminds me of.  No _one_ is
in charge, no group/country either; no cohesive ideology or group is to be
seen (thankfully, truly). Simply put, we (as a species) have built the tools
to destroy ourselves and perhaps even "our" planet. These tools are more
widely available than ever before. What now. There may be more deeply
practical solutions than the ones you offer, however I don't think any _one_
knows what these would look like. With a bit of luck, maybe we can find out.

Love
Elizabeth

ACCESS to the Pentagon press conference was highly restricted. Walter
Pincus was
turned away for wearing a scarf. It was like trying to get into Studio
54 when
Jackie O used to get down/high there.

Anticipating a jingoistic atmosphere, I wore my Gulbuddin Hekmatyar
T-shirt. The
United States government had buried Hekmatyar in cash, when this Afghani
leader
launched his campaign against the Soviets. Of course, to U.S. policy
makers and
intelligence experts, his resume was impeccable and they hired him on
the spot. On
page 3, under hobbies it reads in part, "His followers first gained
attention by
throwing acid in the faces of women who refused to wear the veil. CIA
and State
Department officials I have spoken with call him "scary," "vicious," "a
fascist,"
definite dictatorship material." In short, following in the tradition of
Marcos,
Suharto, Armas, Savimbi, Mobutu, D'Aubisson, Somoza, Noriega,
Fujimori/Montesinos, Saddam Hussein,
Pinochet, etc. ad nauseam, he was "our kind of guy" wrote the CIA
station chief in
Pakistan. Jesse Helms in particular felt a deep kinship with Gulbuddin,
pushing
Congress to make one of his favorite drug running, homicidal maniacs the
commander
of a coalition of the 5 factions fighting the Soviets. Hekmatyar had
never hidden
his hatred for the United States so several of Helms aids were actually
photographed in Gulbuddin's camp wearing mujahideen garb and waving
Kalyshnikov's.
I was whisked right into the press conference.

And there at the podium was Defense Secretary Don Rumsfeld. The man whom
Henry
Kissinger called "the most ruthless man I have ever met."  This from
Henry
Kissinger, the architect of the Madman Theory, the Christmas bombing of
Hanoi, and
the leveraged merger with Communist China. My heart swelled with pride
and awe and
I fought back tears as I stood within a chaw loft of perhaps "the most
ruthless
man" in the world. I knew we were in good hands. Then Rumsfeld began to
speak:

"Ladies and gentleman of the press, as you know, when Francis Fukayama's
book, The
End of History, came out several years ago, I threw a lavish party for
the
Washington press corps for which some of you still owe me a cover. My
feeling and
motivations now are the same as they were then: that you the mass
corporate media
were mostly responsible for selling the kind of glossolalia that drives
Fukayama's
book.

Now, you and I, face another crisis. Some people are going to get the
idea that
history has started up again because of the events of last week and
there gonna
get all wound up. There are even a dangerous few who are going to claim
that
history never stopped. They may even try to claim that the old,
irrelevant
nonsense that was around before Fukayama's book has some bearing on
recent events,
like carving up the Middle East along the geological money shot of the
Western oil
interests. I say piss tosh. If they want to believe in radical fanatical

fundamentalist ideas like history, let them move to a country that has
one.

Ladies and gentlemen, if we had to schmoooze anyone else other than the
American
people, our task would be daunting. But, regardless, we must be
vigilant. We must
be vigilantes for the ahistorical. And I think, if I know anything about

hist…excuse me, the fundamental goodness and fairness of the American
people, we
can count on most Americans to follow us down this path. I am reminded
of the
immortal words of Robert Lovett, cabinet level corporate ad man in the
Eisenhower
administration, who said, "If we can sell the American public all manner
of junk
in huge quantities, we can certainly sell them our fine story of a
Soviet threat."
Eisenhower tried to warn the public but thanks to you good people of the
media,
nobody listened. So your task is clear--present endless prattle and
chatter among
experts whose families eat at the behest of large corporate funders. Cut
off
callers and British scholars that bring up anything before last Tuesday.
And I
mean anything, because as you know we've had our hand in everything. And
finally,
if you want to be invited back here--and we have those really tasty
shrimp roles
today--don't inform yourselves. Thank you. Now I'll take a few
questions.

"Secrtry Rmsfld, Secrtey Rmsfeld!!?"

"Yes, Ted."

"Wheredya get that neat lapel pin, and can I get one."

"Yes, Ted. I'm sure Major General "Iron Guts" Boczinski can spend the
rest of his
afternoon scrounging one up for you."

"Secrtuy Rmsfld, Secrty Rmsfld!!!?"

"Yes, of course, Leslie."

"Secrty Rmsfeld, Secrty Rmsfeld."

"Yes, Stoned."

"That's Stone, Sir."

"What were your parents thinking?"

"Yes, Mr. Secerterry. Mr. Secertury, one of the recently declassified
goals of the
bombing of North Vietnam was to accidentally kill the leadership
especially that
really bad guy."

"Ho Chih Minh?"

"Yeah. Cho Mein. Yet even though we dropped 4 times the tonnage used in
all the
theaters of World War II including the 2 atomic bombs onto Southeast
Asia, Choo
Main drove a Mercedes and died of gout, I think. How do you propose to
use such
pinpoint bombing to get Osama Bin Laden?"

"Good question Stone, and you didn't even really violate our prohibition
on
bringing up history, now did you?"

"I don't think so, sir. Actually, I don't know.'

"Take my word, son; the word of "THE MOST RUTHLESS MAN IN THE WORLD. You
did not.
But to answer your question. As Curtis LeMay so rightly observed.
Somebody
belonged in the stone age over there and when it was pointed out by--
was it Carl
Albert, General?--that perhaps they were already there, so were we. I
mean back in
those days, we were practically throwin' bombs outta planes with our
bare hands
and tryin' to--what's that word--saturate the whole place and all them
other
places around about so everybody would be terrorized. Madman Theory.
Remember."

"Sir."

"Yes, General. You used the "T" word in the wrong context. We've been
over that."

"You know how to apply a little pressure if anybody gets outta line.
Just give 'em
the old. See these stars.
Now, see these stars. Except for Leslie. I kinda fancy her."

"What Madman theory, Sir?"

"Thank you, Stone. There you go, General. Is it real or is it Sominex?"

"Keep it Real."

"Thanks, Dan."

"You betcha."

"Sir?"

"Ed?"

"Sir, if we invade Afgiuneastand, do you think we'll find any tamale
powder?"

"No, Ed. That was Panama. Remember, Ed. You were there. Hey, Ed. What
did you do
with that cash that you found in the basement of the Saigon Embassy?"

"Mr. Prsidnt. Mr. Prsidnt."

"No, Balz. This isn't the White House Press Conference."

"Oh?"

"Any other questions for the Secretary? Yes, uh, Gnome is it?"

"Mr. Secretary. Isn't it true that the U.S. began funding Afghan Islamic

fundamentalism in 1979 despite the fact that in February of that year
some of them
had kidnapped the American ambassador in the capital city of Kabul,
leading to his
death in the rescue attempt."

"Uh. Mr. Chomsky, is it? Would YOU like a lapel button. And I'm not
asking."

Hi to my friends and family,

In attempting to find the most effective way to respond to last week's
tragedy, I've decided to donate the amount of my tax rebate to the United
Way September 11th Fund and to Red Cross support efforts in Afghanistan.
This $280 (the amount of my rebate) was not something I expected or
budgeted for (or agreed with, for that matter) and I think that it is a
substantial enough donation to make a difference as New York in particular
attempts to recover and as innocent Afghanis prepare for our probable
attacks.  I was planning to donate my rebate to charitable causes anyway,
and now, tragically, I don't have to make the difficult decision of whom
to help...

About the September 11th Fund, which I chose in part because of its
treatment of administrative costs: "United Way and The New York Community
Trust have established The September 11th Fund. Contributions will be used
to help respond to the immediate and longer-term needs of the victims,
their families, and communities affected by the events of September 11.
Please note that 100% of all contributions will be used to support these
efforts, as United Way and The Community Trust are underwriting all
administrative costs."

Donations may be made online at http://september11fund.org/, or you can
pledge by phone at 1-800-710-8002

Learn about the Red Cross in Afghanistan at
http://www.redcross.org/world/asia/afgh.html

Of course, other charities and emergency support organizations are also
prepared to accept donations.

I want to urge everyone to join me!  Let's show a very tangible form of
support for those thousands of people suffering so terribly.

Molly

I think tou're correct here, Scott, in general.  This will lead to major
global change if the reaction I feel is any indication.  I'm not sure where
the world is headed but if this list is any indication of thoughtful
response (I don't want to have to single out particular respondees but I
have been very encouraged by the general tenor) knee-jerk responses of
whatever flavor should be seen I think as based on an incomplete grasp of
the magnitude of the impact and implications of recent events.

The tremendous empathy which has been stirred, in the
West and in much of the Third World, for the victims
of last week's attacks is authentic, and thus has the
ability to build and spread and break through the
national and ethnic barriers manned by warmongering

    My personal view is that there is no way to stop the US oil/military
juggernaut from conducting this war, and even that it will be to the world's
benefit if it can actually be targeted at terrorists and their money (they
sold short on American and United Airlines stock right before they hijacked
the planes -- they fucking made money on it).

   As someone who went through the VietNam years (a war I thought the US was
on the wrong side of), I kind of wish this effort could be aimed at doing
what what we spectacularly didn't do there, or in any other country (Laos,
Cambodia) we ripped up in that war:  something like a Marshall Plan.

        Maybe that's just paternalist -- closet globalization.  But that's
my personal hope.

Interviewing Chomsky

Why do you think these attacks happened?

To answer the question we must first identify the
perpetrators of the crimes. It is generally assumed,
plausibly, that their origin is the Middle East
region, and that the attacks probably trace back to
the Osama Bin Laden network, a widespread and complex
organization, doubtless inspired by Bin Laden but not
necessarily acting under his control. Let us assume
that this is true. Then to answer your question a
sensible person would try to ascertain Bin Laden's
views, and the sentiments of the large reservoir of
supporters he has throughout the region. About all of
this, we have a great deal of information. Bin Laden
has been interviewed extensively over the years by
highly reliable Middle East specialists, notably the
most eminent correspondent in the region, Robert Fisk
(London _Independent_), who has intimate knowledge of
the entire region and direct experience over decades.
A Saudi Arabian millionaire, Bin Laden became a
militant Islamic leader in the war to drive the
Russians out of Afghanistan. He was one of the many
religious fundamentalist extremists recruited, armed,
and financed by the CIA and their allies in Pakistani
intelligence to cause maximal harm to the Russians --
quite possibly delaying their withdrawal, many
analysts suspect -- though whether he personally
happened to have direct contact with the CIA is
unclear, and not particularly important. Not
surprisingly, the CIA preferred the most fanatic and
cruel fighters they could mobilize. The end result was
to "destroy a moderate regime and create a fanatical
one, from groups recklessly financed by the Americans"
(_London Times_ correspondent Simon Jenkins, also a
specialist on the region). These "Afghanis" as they
are called (many, like Bin Laden, not from
Afghanistan) carried out terror operations across the
border in Russia, but they terminated these after
Russia withdrew. Their war was not against Russia,
which they despise, but against the Russian occupation
and Russia's crimes against Muslims.



The "Afghanis" did not terminate their activities,
however. They joined Bosnian Muslim forces in the
Balkan Wars; the US did not object, just as it
tolerated Iranian support for them, for complex
reasons that we need not pursue here, apart from
noting that concern for the grim fate of the Bosnians
was not prominent among them. The "Afghanis" are also
fighting the Russians in Chechnya, and, quite
possibly, are involved in carrying out terrorist
attacks in Moscow and elsewhere in Russian territory.
Bin Laden and his "Afghanis" turned against the US in
1990 when they established permanent bases in Saudi
Arabia -- from his point of view, a counterpart to the
Russian occupation of Afghanistan, but far more
significant because of Saudi Arabia's special status
as the guardian of the holiest shrines.



Bin Laden is also bitterly opposed to the corrupt and
repressive regimes of the region, which he regards as
"un-Islamic," including the Saudi Arabian regime, the
most extreme Islamic fundamentalist regime in the
world, apart from the Taliban, and a close US ally
since its origins. Bin Laden despises the US for its
support of these regimes. Like others in the region,
he is also outraged by long-standing US support for
Israel's brutal military occupation, now in its 35th
year: Washington's decisive diplomatic, military, and
economic intervention in support of the killings, the
harsh and destructive siege over many years, the daily
humiliation to which Palestinians are subjected, the
expanding settlements designed to break the occupied
territories into Bantustan-like cantons and take
control of the resources, the gross violation of the
Geneva Conventions, and other actions that are
recognized as crimes throughout most of the world,
apart from the US, which has prime responsibility for
them. And like others, he contrasts Washington's
dedicated support for these crimes with the
decade-long US-British assault against the civilian
population of Iraq, which has devastated the society
and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths while
strengthening Saddam Hussein -- who was a favored
friend and ally of the US and Britain right through
his worst atrocities, including the gassing of the
Kurds, as people of the region also remember well,
even if Westerners prefer to forget the facts. These
sentiments are very widely shared. The _Wall Street
Journal_ (Sept. 14) published a survey of opinions of
wealthy and privileged Muslims in the Gulf region
(bankers, professionals, businessmen with close links
to the U.S.). They expressed much the same views:
resentment of the U.S. policies of supporting Israeli
crimes and blocking the international consensus on a
diplomatic settlement for many years while devastating
Iraqi civilian society, supporting harsh and
repressive anti-democratic regimes throughout the
region, and imposing barriers against economic
development by "propping up oppressive regimes." Among
the great majority of people suffering deep poverty
and oppression, similar sentiments are far more
bitter, and are the source of the fury and despair
that has led to suicide bombings, as commonly
understood by those who are interested in the facts.



The U.S., and much of the West, prefers a more
comforting story. To quote the lead analysis in the
_New York Times_ (Sept. 16), the perpetrators acted
out of "hatred for the values cherished in the West as
freedom, tolerance, prosperity, religious pluralism
and universal suffrage." U.S. actions are irrelevant,
and therefore need not even be mentioned (Serge
Schmemann). This is a convenient picture, and the
general stance is not unfamiliar in intellectual
history; in fact, it is close to the norm. It happens
to be completely at variance with everything we know,
but has all the merits of self-adulation and
uncritical support for power.

It is also widely recognized that Bin Laden and others
like him are praying for "a great assault on Muslim
states," which will cause "fanatics to flock to his
cause" (Jenkins, and many others.). That too is
familiar. The escalating cycle of violence is
typically welcomed by the harshest and most brutal
elements on both sides, a fact evident enough from the
recent history of the Balkans, to cite only one of
many cases.





What consequences will they have on US inner policy
and to the American self reception?

US policy has already been officially announced. The
world is being offered a "stark choice": join us, or
"face the certain prospect of death and destruction."
Congress has authorized the use of force against any
individuals or countries the President determines to
be involved in the attacks, a doctrine that every
supporter regards as ultra-criminal. That is easily
demonstrated. Simply ask how the same people would
have reacted if Nicaragua had adopted this doctrine
after the U.S. had rejected the orders of the World
Court to terminate its "unlawful use of force" against
Nicaragua and had vetoed a Security Council resolution
calling on all states to observe international law.
And that terrorist attack was far more severe and
destructive even than this atrocity.



As for how these matters are perceived here, that is
far more complex. One should bear in mind that the
media and the intellectual elites generally have their
particular agendas. Furthermore, the answer to this
question is, in significant measure, a matter of
decision: as in many other cases, with sufficient
dedication and energy, efforts to stimulate
fanaticism, blind hatred, and submission to authority
can be reversed. We all know that very well.





  Do you expect U.S. to profoundly change their policy
to the rest of the world?

The initial response was to call for intensifying the
policies that led to the fury and resentment that
provides the background of support for the terrorist
attack, and to pursue more intensively the agenda of
the most hard line elements of the leadership:
increased militarization, domestic regimentation,
attack on social programs. That is all to be expected.
Again, terror attacks, and the escalating cycle of
violence they often engender, tend to reinforce the
authority and prestige of the most harsh and
repressive elements of a society. But there is nothing
inevitable about submission to this course.





After the first shock, came fear of what the U.S.
answer is going to be. Are you afraid, too?

Every sane person should be afraid of the likely
reaction -- the one that has already been announced,
the one that probably answers Bin Laden's prayers. It
is highly likely to escalate the cycle of violence, in
the familiar way, but in this case on a far greater
scale.



The U.S. has already demanded that Pakistan terminate
the food and other supplies that are keeping at least
some of the starving and suffering people of
Afghanistan alive. If that demand is implemented,
unknown numbers of people who have not the remotest
connection to terrorism will die, possibly millions.
Let me repeat: the U.S. has demanded that Pakistan
kill possibly millions of people who are themselves
victims of the Taliban. This has nothing to do even
with revenge. It is at a far lower moral level even
than that. The significance is heightened by the fact
that this is mentioned in passing, with no comment,
and probably will hardly be noticed. We can learn a
great deal about the moral level of the reigning
intellectual culture of the West by observing the
reaction to this demand. I think we can be reasonably
confident that if the American population had the
slightest idea of what is being done in their name,
they would be utterly appalled. It would be
instructive to seek historical precedents.

If Pakistan does not agree to this and other U.S.
demands, it may come under direct attack as well --
with unknown consequences. If Pakistan does submit to
U.S. demands, it is not impossible that the government
will be overthrown by forces much like the Taliban --
who in this case will have nuclear weapons. That could
have an effect throughout the region, including the
oil producing states. At this point we are considering
the possibility of a war that may destroy much of
human society.



Even without pursuing such possibilities, the
likelihood is that an attack on Afghans will have
pretty much the effect that most analysts expect: it
will enlist great numbers of others to support of Bin
Laden, as he hopes. Even if he is killed, it will make
little difference. His voice will be heard on
cassettes that are distributed throughout the Islamic
world, and he is likely to be revered as a martyr,
inspiring others. It is worth bearing in mind that one
suicide bombing -- a truck driven into a U.S. military
base -- drove the world's major military force out of
Lebanon 20 years ago. The opportunities for such
attacks are endless. And suicide attacks are very hard
to prevent.





"The world will never be the same after 11.09.01". Do
you think so?

The horrendous terrorist attacks on Tuesday are
something quite new in world affairs, not in their
scale and character, but in the target. For the US,
this is the first time since the War of 1812 that its
national territory has been under attack, even threat.
It's colonies have been attacked, but not the national
territory itself. During these years the US virtually
exterminated the indigenous population, conquered half
of Mexico, intervened violently in the surrounding
region, conquered Hawaii and the Philippines (killing
hundreds of thousands of Filipinos), and in the past
half century particularly, extended its resort to
force throughout much of the world. The number of
victims is colossal. For the first time, the guns have
been directed the other way. The same is true, even
more dramatically, of Europe. Europe has suffered
murderous destruction, but from internal wars,
meanwhile conquering much of the world with extreme
brutality. It has not been under attack by its victims
outside, with rare exceptions (the IRA in England, for
example). It is therefore natural that NATO should
rally to the support of the US; hundreds of years of
imperial violence have an enormous impact on the
intellectual and moral culture.



It is correct to say that this is a novel event in
world history, not because of the scale of the
atrocity -- regrettably -- but because of the target.
How the West chooses to react is a matter of supreme
importance. If the rich and powerful choose to keep to
their traditions of hundreds of years and resort to
extreme violence, they will contribute to the
escalation of a cycle of violence, in a familiar
dynamic, with long-term consequences that could be
awesome. Of course, that is by no means inevitable. An
aroused public within the more free and democratic
societies can direct policies towards a much more
humane and honorable course.

...these days, of two brave & thoughtful warriors I have met:

A professor, of the Blackfoot (Native American) Nation, a legal scholar, who
told us students of his experience in Vietnam. He joined up, in part because
his traditions honor warriors, only to find himself standing in a field in
Vietnam, watching a village burn, and coming to the realization that this
was exactly what the US Army, of which he was now a part, had done to his
people.

An Iraqi man who was staying in the same youth hostel as one of my sisters
and I in Amsterdam, 1992. Much of his family and friends had been killed in
Baghdad. His manner was friendly and thoughtful towards us, despite our
nationality.

In response to Kasey's post, and others' about their provisional
acceptance/misgivings about the flag:

Kasey's remarks on left politics and patriotism are well taken.  It is an
interesting and perhaps a regrettable precipitate of the history of dissent
in the U.S. that the American flag has become so closely associated for some
with a kind of thoughtless default conservatism (if not xenophobic
nationalism).  It is most likely too late for this, but imagine what this
icon would look like to us if the left had found a way to embrace patriotism
and love of country as King does when he writes, by way of framing his Civil
Rights activism, "There is no great disappointment where there is no great
love."  ("A Letter from a Birmingham Jail")

With gratitude for everyone's thoughtful and frank remarks--since this may
be the closest approximation of a public space we will have for a long
while.  I am so frightened of the major media outlets' presumption of
consensus...

The past week list has been such a good source of
information, comfort, sensitivity, criticism =
COMMUNITY and I thank you all for that.

Re: flag waving.  I am so conflicted about this.  Our
across-the-street neighbors put up a flag last
Wednesday and I immediately wanted one, too -- not as
a show of strength or government support or even
solidarity, but from some deep feeling of gratitude
that this country was still standing.  That the
weather in Boston was beautiful and that I still had
across-the-street neighbors.  Last week all of that
seemed like a miracle.

Since then, I have been able to be more critical and
wary of the whole flag-waving phenomenon, but I am
also still very conflicted and interested in what it
means to be a patriotic American.  I certainly think
one can be patriotic AND critical, and that in fact
the two probably go hand in hand.  I disagree much of
what our government says, I am distraught over what we
have done to the earth, etc., etc., and I have even
(often?) thought of leaving the country, but I also
love it.  I love the geographical and ethnic
diversity, the aesthetic beauty of the national parks,
the openness.  I am so proud that Americans invented
hip hop, bluegrass, jazz and rock n' roll.  I love my
students, many of whom are first-generation college
students and have so much to give, so many ideas.  Can
I wave a flag for all of that?

I also love, and miss, New York City, which, for the
five years I lived there, treated me with extreme
kindness and openness, and which, as exhausting and
ugly as it could be, was also frequently stunning and
inspiring, and like no other city in the world.  So
when all this happened, I wanted to wave a flag for
that, too.

Arielle

And we Canadians have to remind ourselves of the unironical
attachment that USAmericans have for their flag. They have a national
anthem filled with the flag and bombs and rockets, and they fly
thousands of flags in any small town, and they even have the flag in
their first-grade school classrooms! It is a kind of atavism that
seems primitive to outsiders, but for which we should not blame any
single person, poet or othe, raised in that environment. I mean I
have seen US flags flying in front of hamburger joints!

lunberry@uwm.edu. forwards this note from the NYT on this bon mot from
Karlheinz Stockhausen:

My question to the list is: is this bon mot an expression of German
Romanticism, or German Modernism, or just good old Modernism in general?

Stockhausen's envy of the genius of these "characters" reminds me why I
ultimately prefer Post-Modernism.

Also, let me add my name to the list of those who have taken heart from this
List's simple, unartful, need to talk about what happened last week.  The
more scholarly e-mail lists that I belong to have hardly acknowledged these
events. Weird, unhealthy, stoicism, I suppose.

I more or less liked Ron Silliman's pontifications, but I liked this response
better.

This was written by my friend Joe, who works at Goldman Sachs trying to pay
off the debts he accrued getting his Brown PhD in classics/history of
mathematics. He wrote it for himself, but he shared it with me. I asked him
if I could send this along, and he said by all means.

Thanks to all who responded in reply to my posting about the use of the
phrase "Ground Zero". That was extremely interesting and useful to me

Jeffrey, when I started reading you, and you saying it's "an attempt at
euphemism", I thought sure, but *why?... and then you told me!

I worked for years very near to the site of a pretty horrible railway
accident of a few years back so that crash had some immediacy for me
although I knew no one involved. The spot itself has no name as such, it's
just a stretch of embankment without anything special about it until the
accident, except perhaps to a fox or rat. Humans hurtle by it.

There is no name as such to be painfully recalled. But I always remember
that crash when I go near the place or if I happen to be looking out of the
train window as I go past. So I understand to some extent, enough to know
that there is more one could feel.

"the site," or "downtown." are better, I think, than "ground zero" because
of that metaphorical connection with nukes, which is, I believe,
inappropriate and unfortunate

Laura - I was having a break with friends a few days ago, mid morning, in a
garden, in a beautiful place, and four fighter bombers flew over very low
just subsonic

I suppose it was meant to reassure us, but we did not feel reassured, at
all. It just scared us. And I recalled maybe the first day in a new house
when I was about 12 - the local factory used the all-clear on an old air
raid siren to mark the end of a shift - quarries use them too, to warn of a
detonation. Even though it was the all clear, the association was enough to
terrify my mother. I remember very clearly I heard a noise I knew vaguely I
had heard before but for her, over 15 years after the blitz, many times the
duration of the actual experience; the terror of bombing was just part of
her

Patrick, all points taken, all is relative, but I can never rid myself, nor
would I want this side of new Jerusalem, of that sequence at the end of
Strangelove when *all the nukes go up. I think I stand by my hope that we -
we, yes, though I am aware it's your city and not mine - remain clear this
wasn't a nuke and a nuke could have been far worse - it's not that they
don't make em small; it's that when one is used again, there'll be a call
for retaliation in kind; and that, if one had been used in the same manner
on this occasion, it would most likely have been "dirty"

Depleted uranium, yes... or a plane crashed on a shipment of nuclear waste

The idea that the possibilities can all be accounted for is not on

Pardon if this has already been discussed.  I can't keep up with the Poetics
List in normal times, and these are not normal times.

NPR had a story this morning which I take to be an exclusive, since I have
yet to hear or read this anywhere else.  The story was by Nina Totenberg --
who normally covers the Supreme Court and is no flake.  She reports that the
administration is considering using secret military tribunals to try the
terrorists if they get their hands on them.  She went on to cite the rather
sparse prior history of the use of secret military tribunals in the United
States.

Was asked to forward this from RAWA.

Reuven BenYuhmin

======================================================================
Below is a  statement from the Revolutionary Association of the Women of
Afghanistan (RAWA)on the terrorist attacks in the US. This is the women's
organisation featured on the recent UK program rebroadcast on Four Corners.

The statement has been sent to the Refugee Research Centre at UNSW and they
have asked for it to be circulated as widely as possible.
                                        Heather.

The people of Afghanistan have nothing to do with Osama and his accomplices

On September 11, 2001 the world was stunned with the horrific terrorist
attacks on the United States. RAWA stands with the rest of the world in
expressing our sorrow and condemnation for this barbaric act of violence
and terror. RAWA had already warned that the United States should not
support the most treacherous, most criminal, most anti-democracy and
anti-women Islamic fundamentalist parties because after both the Jehadi and
the Taliban have committed every possible type of heinous crimes against
our people, they would feel no shame in committing such crimes against the
American people whom they consider "infidel". In order to gain and maintain
their power, these barbaric criminals are ready to turn easily to any
criminal force.

But unfortunately we must say that it was the government of the United
States who supported Pakistani dictator Gen. Zia-ul Haq in creating
thousands of religious schools from which the germs of Taliban emerged. In
the similar way, as is clear to all, Osama Bin Laden has been the blue-eyed
boy of CIA. But what is more painful is that American politicians have not
drawn a lesson from their pro-fundamentalist policies in our country and
are still supporting this or that fundamentalist band or leader. In our
opinion any kind of support to the fundamentalist Taliban and Jehadies is
actually trampling democratic, women's rights and human rights values.

If it is established that the suspects of the terrorist attacks are outside
the US, our constant claim that fundamentalist terrorists would devour
their creators, is proved once more.

The US government should consider the root cause of this terrible event,
which has not been the first and will not be the last one too. The US
should stop supporting Afghan terrorists and their supporters once and for
all.

Now that the Taliban and Osama are the prime suspects by the US officials
after the criminal attacks, will the US subject Afghanistan to a military
attack similar to the one in 1998 and kill thousands of innocent Afghans
for the crimes committed by the Taliban and Osama? Does the US think that
through such attacks, with thousands of deprived, poor and innocent people
of Afghanistan as its victims, will be able to wipe out the root-cause of
terrorism, or will it spread terrorism even to a larger scale?

>From our point of view a vast and indiscriminate military attacks on a
country that has been facing permanent disasters for more than two decades
will not be a matter of pride. We don't think such an attack would be the
expression of the will of the American people.

The US government and people should know that there is a vast difference
between the poor and devastated people of Afghanistan and the terrorist
Jehadi and Taliban criminals.

While we once again announce our solidarity and deep sorrow with the people
of the US, we also believe that attacking Afghanistan and killing its most
ruined and destitute people will not in any way decrease the grief of the
American people. We sincerely hope that the great American people could
DIFFERENTIATE between the people of Afghanistan and a handful of
fundamentalist terrorists. Our hearts go out to the people of the US.

Down with terrorism!

I cried when I read Ron's report.  It is truly the best thing I've read
on the situation we're in and it is so humane, accurate, brilliantly
argued, and fair-minded.  Thank you Ron.  This article should be
circulated widely--let's all do that--and printed in a leading
periodical.  And of course later on it will be part of Ron's Collected
Writings.

So--thank you Ron!

Marjorie

Dear Listees,

I'm writing to describe some of the recent responses of the community
here in Portland (Oregon), but first I want to thank everyone in New
York and beyond for checking in and for your accounts of your
experiences. It has been a crucial link for me--and, I think, for many
of those of us on the "outside"--that helped make it possible to feel
somehow connected to that reality, and as a corrective to the
constructed images of the mainstream media. Especially in the first
week, when it was impossible to get through to anyone in the 212 or 718
area codes by telephone.

I've been glued to the computer screen (tonight's Poetics digest for
instance taking, what, 3 hours to read and assimilate?) and the
telephone since the first bulletins came through (I was awake and online
early that morning, and was convinced at first that it was a prank, that
someone had hacked into the New York Times news alerts). Though I've
been away a long time now, New York is still the only place I care to
call "home," and as crazy as it sounds to some (based on the reactions
I've gotten from people here when I say it), I wish very much that I'd
been there.

Let me also thank everyone who has participated, continues to
participate in the ongoing dialogue over the political meaning and
context of what has happened, and the possible and necessary strategies
of response. It takes real time and effort, but is indispensable. The
deeply informed and painstakingly cogent arguments of many, and the
forwarded/pasted articles, interviews, commentaries, have made a more
comprehensive and nuanced perception of where we find ourselves at least
possible.


On Sunday a still-coalescing organization called the Portland Peaceful
Response Coalition sponsored a gathering--a vigil and march, expressing
outrage over the attacks and grief for the victims, but opposition to
the war and to racist attacks--in the park blocks downtown. There were
several speakers (representatives of clergy, and activists from local,
national, and international groups), and then a march, in which more
than 2500 of us walked through downtown, around the main square (Pioneer
Courthouse Square), and back to the park blocks--many carrying signs,
many singing, but with a pretty quiet, somber mood pervading. Originally
intended to stay on the sidewalks, the numbers were too great and it
spilled into the streets. Volunteer traffic/security folk managed
admirably to balance the desires of the marchers and the motorists;
eventually, officials from the transit system (Tri-Met, bus and light
rail) and police assisted. We couldn't regroup in the square itself, as
another organization had reserved it--the march had been called on
extremely short notice, and was conducted without a permit. After
returning to the park blocks, thousands of flowers were laid in a
central location in memory of those lost, and there were additional
speakers before the gathering dispersed.

I've just tonight returned from the first post-march organizational
meeting of the Coalition (I was not involved with the pre-march
organization). The group was very large, more than a hundred people, and
struggled for hours to resolve basic questions of structure,
decision-making, mission, etc. (The two facilitators did a remarkable
job under the circumstances.) The two largest contingents in the group
seem to be 1) seasoned activists from various preexisting organizations,
and 2) college students, many of whom were in the thick of the WTO
protests in Seattle. Consequently, there was a division between those
who favor a traditional, hierarchical and thus efficient structure
(centralized steering committe, etc.), and those who believe that a more
horizontal structure, composed of small groups with well-defined aims
but no central decision-making body, provides for true consensus and
direct involvement/investment of all who participate. The challenge for
the latter notion is to remain feasible with a very large (and hopefully
growing) group; as it was, very many people left in frustration after
the first hour and a half. A temporary compromise seems to have been
reached that will no doubt undergo revision and contest in coming weeks,
as we attempt to "embody the conflict in the structure," as one
participant put it..

I've heard that this was one of the first and largest such public
actions opposing the coming bloodshed. (I haven't confirmed that claim;
one of the disadvantages of *not* following the mainstream press, not
owning a television, etc., is sometimes missing very basic national
news.) In any case, I've bothered to describe it here merely in the hope
that it might inspire some of you (who perhaps are wondering, as I am,
what there is to be done) to join similar coalitions forming wherever
you are; or if none have formed, then to gather a few friends together
and start one.

I've taken Ron's concerns (about the danger of a "habitual" progressive
response, that doesn't take into account unique particulars of the
moment), and the replies to them, very much to heart. But, as many have
noted, time is terribly short, and to begin putting *some* response in
place seems imperative, just as a debate about strategy is inevitable.

Working through public organizations certainly isn't for everyone--in
the past, it hasn't been for me--and I am confident that just about
everyone, in their own ways, will be lending themselves to whatever they
can perceive as some common good. I've been rereading, as I have done
before in times of crisis, Thich Nhat Hanh's _Peace Is Every Step_, and
I am convinced that he's right, that as the Dalai Lama says in his brief
introduction, "Although attempting to bring about world peace through
the internal transformation of individuals is difficult, it is the only
way.".

Nonetheless, I'm more frightened by the current situation than I have
ever been. As I walked back from the march, the other rally was taking
place in the square. There was a three-storey tall U.S. flag on the side
of one of the office buildings around the square, everyone was waving
and wearing flags, and "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" was thundering
over the sound system. Though I can easily imagine many of the flags in
neighbors' windows as transitional objects, this was clearly something
else indeed. I fear that our likely military course promises an
unprecedented potential for escalation and reprisal--an extended and
widening cycle of retaliations and terrorist attacks--and concomitant
fundamental changes domestically, utterly unlike any other "conflict" in
my lifetime. The excerpts from the Chomsky Belgrade interview sketch
this possibility in persuasive terms. I can only hope that I'm utterly
and hysterically wrong.

I wasn't surprised to see the quotation from _Of Being Numerous_ in John
Gallaher's recent post. The following sections, dead in the center of
the 40-section sequence, have been ringing in my head continually over
the past week. Heartbreakingly.

I hear them in his voice: though he doesn't read the poem on the more
widely available and much later Watershed tape, I have a recording (at
one time distributed by Norton, and no doubt available in various
library and archive collections) of a reading at the 92nd Street Y in
late 1966 or early 1967, before the publication by New Directions of the
volume containing the poem (and the subsequent Pulitzer). A young Armand
Schwerner introduces eloquently and at length, and then Oppen reads the
entire sequence, first announcing that the title had just been changed
to the one we now know--prior to that it had been titled "A Language of
New York."


18

It is the air of atrocity,
An event as ordinary
As a President.

A plume of smoke, visible at a distance
In which people burn.


19

Now in the helicopters the casual will
Is atrocious

Insanity in high places,
If it is true we must do these things
We must cut our throats

The fly in the bottle

Insane, the insane fly

Which, over the city
Is the bright light of shipwreck


20

-- They await

War, and the news
Is war

As always

That the juices may flow in them
Tho the juices lie.

Great things have happened
On the earth and given it history, armies
And the ragged hordes moving and the passions
Of that death. But who escapes
Death

Among these riders
Of the subway,

They know
By now as I know

Failure and the guilt
Of failure.
As in Hardy’s poem of Christmas

We might half-hope to find the animals
In the sheds of a nation
Kneeling at midnight,

Farm animals,
Draft animals, beasts for slaughter
Because it would mean they have forgiven us,
Or which is the same thing,
That we do not altogether matter.


21

There can be a brick
In a brick wall
The eye picks

So quiet of a Sunday
Here is the brick, it was waiting
Here when you were born

Mary-Anne.


22

Clarity

In the sense of _transparence_,
I don’t mean that much can be explained.

Clarity in the sense of silence.

There was some discussion of Stockhausen's comments in the most recent
digest of the discussion list devoted to John Cage and his work, the
silence-digest list. (Backchannel for more information on that list if
you're interested.) Though it is very difficult to get a useful sense of
the context of the remarks from the available excerpts of the interview,
which are in various ad hoc translations from the original German, it
does seem that an exchange that was extremely metaphorical  may have
been rather distorted by the reporter. That position, at least, is
maintained by the website that is the closest to an official response
from Stockhausen: http://stockhausen.org/reply_to_bild.html

Despite this explanation, there have been widespread denunciations of
his remarks, including statements by colleagues such as Gyorgy Ligeti,
etc., and others, that he has "gone off the deep end" and in need of
psychiatric treatment, and so on.

scale is important ron  -  i agree

but families in northern ireland who have been the victims of terrorist
attacks (have had loved ones killed) frequently call for there to be no
retribution as that would only bring suffering on other families and they
don't want others to have to go through what they themselves are suffering

they've learnt this over the course of decades of terrorist activity on
their own 'soil'

extend that humane notion

love and love

Rick Moody and I were asked by the PSA to go ahead with a reading tonight
here, in New York, at Joe's Pub at the Public Theater on Lafayette Street
at 7:30.  We will, in some form.

And a postscript to my first account, which I seem to have missed in the
chaos here but no doubt went through, from our windows now the site each
night is lit like a movie set -- lights we're used to looking out on the
other side on Washington Square Park, where so often that eerie
daylight-in-night has floated up.  There is the odd green plaid of the Kohn
Pederson Fox building, suddenly looking large, and then the large horizon,
filled with the plumes of dust and that bright, bright light.  It's the
last thing I see before sleep unless, as I admit I've done several times
this week, I pull the curtains.

Let's be really, really careful with accusations like this. Any clue as to
the source of this (perhaps non-) information? Isn't it likely that Arafat's
call for a cease fire had more to do with Israel's demand that he agree to
one before they would come to the table to even discuss implementation of
the Mitchell Plan? And if I recall correctly, Israel has acted just a tad
bit opportunistically in its encroachment of West Bank settlements just days
after the disaster. Certainly reports from friends and colleagues around the
world are especially illuminative at times like this, when we know we're not
getting the whole story from the media (or, in the case of the Palestinian
"celebrants" a manipulated story, perhaps even worse), but if this one
proves to be untrue, as I'm guessing it will, some very dangerous and unfair
dis-information has been thrown into the fire.

And today a new development.  Karen Gut, whom many of you know
(she read and spoke at the Orono Poetry Festival on the 60s a year+
ago and is a professor-poet-activist in Tel Aviv) writes me that the
reason Arafat has just agreed to a cease fire, or rather proposed a
unilateral one, is that Israeli intelligence has discovered that the
four pilots, esp. the lead one, Joseph Natta, was a Palestinian, and
so Arafat is very embarrassed and he is now begging for a "peace"
meeting.

hi cris. i couldn't agree more with your post.
>>Something needs to start rolling and it needs to have a freshness that can
get the discussion away from responses based on equally old hat models of
confrontation<<

Marjorie and all,

I've already thanked Ron backchannel for this, but I wanted to second
Marjorie's praise (and of course, my echoing Marjorie is one more sign that
these be unusual times).  Ron's article, which I would not have predicted,
was among the first to actually help me cope with my own response.  Many of
the follow-ups have also been helpful, even in their disagreement.

Yes, this is, at root, a war between religions, which began with the
Crusades. Islam makes no bones about it. Judeo-Christianity is more
circumscript. But when I hear "God Bless America" sung these days, I hear it
as "Onward Christian Soldiers." It is not geopolitical, but georeligious. It
is not so much against capitalism--many Arabs are capitalists--but is my God
against your God. Yahweh, Allah, Christ, are at war with each other, using
human surrogates. It is Homeric. Those airplanes were Trojan horses.
Americans run to their churches, Israelis to their temples, Muslims to their
mosques, all praying for victory against each other. What happened in
Yugoslavia, what continues in Ireland, is all part of this global conflict
of religions. It's a war between cultures, all of which are planted in
religious compost. As poets, we must keep in mind what is happening
cosmically, not just politically, and make this clear to others.

Lawrence, that's perhaps the most bittersweet of all movie scenes for me,
Slim Pickens ridin' that ICBM like he's at some rodeo.  Riding it down to
the End of the World.  And the whole cowboy thing fits, oh, fits SO well.
Kubrick's visual style really coalesced with that movie, and that's my
favorite scene.  We'll meet again...

Rumsfeld and others have explicitly not ruled out use of nukes.  He even
said he was proud of America's restraint, that the US hasn't used one in
over 50 years.  Restraint?  RESTRAINT?  Maybe they're just doing the Reagan
rope-a-dope, trying to "close the credibility gap."  People across the globe
genuinely were afraid of "Evil Empire" Reagan who appeared incredibly
irrational to most.  After all, Arendt taught us and Orwell illustrated for
us that being irrational is crucial for a totalitarian leader.  I doubt
anyone thinks Dumya is rational.  Maybe he wants to demonstrate how
irrational he is.  I expect not, but who knows what's going to happen when
someone wants to appear irrational on a global scale?

Nothing like being paid well to discuss genocide as an option.  Hey, how do
I get a job like that?  Hmm, yes, let's see,

 With an MX here,
 And an MX there
 here an MX there an MX
 everywhere an MX
 old Don Rumsfeld lobbed some nukes
 e-i-e-i-Oh!


I can sing that!


Of course in Universal terms, the end of humanity would be barely a blip on
the radar screen.  Maybe for some people that represents a very small risk.
"What America needs is a good healthy nuclear scare," someone in the
(Pentagon/White House/State Department) seems to be telling us.

We'll meet again,
Don't know where,
Don't know when,
But I know
We'll meet again
Some sunny day.


Ahh, Vera.


Now Gitty Up Them Dogies,

It seems to me underlying the Chinese Room test is the ghost of
Wittgenstein's idea of language games, that is, language is an activity
completely comprehensible, subsumed in its rules -that private language or
content/signified is an illusion. This is an a priori statement with which I
have no wish to agree.

If language is a game, morality is a manipulation of symbols. Then, the
murder of six thousand people -through deft logical manipulation- can be seen
as a self reflective act by the victims.

On BBC Radio 4 17th September, Admiral Stephen Baker, speaking from
Washington, said
that in the past US policy had been '+too+ sensitive to 'collateral damage'
among civilians' and this policy 'was being reviewed'

An _conservative_ estimate I have seen for the mumber of fatalities
inflicted by US forces overseas since the end of WWII: 8,000,000.

Possibly as many as 90% of them civilian.

I appreciate the searching questioning of Ron's post, but does not its
overall tenor lead to the stance that military action is suitable for
support? , while it saddens me that so much of the post is taken up with
critiques of the left, a left that in the UK as in the USA is effectively
powerless and unable to influence the situation.

What is to be done indeed is the question, but not in the sense that the
likes of us will have any control over it, any part in decision making,
where it is a question for us are what are to be consequences of what will
be done, is to be done, consequences to what democratic processes there are,
consequences to the dull witted ponderous rhetoric of public discourse by
which so many lives' courses are decided.

Ron: While I don't have time to write more fully about your position, I
must say I was dismayed. Not by the content or position, necessarily, but
by the mode of argument. You feel attacked, but your primary polemic is
against what you perceive as the passivity or quietism of the "left." Apart
from a reasonable list of critical positions many of us would take--such as
arguments against bombing civilians, a.k.a. collateral damage--what is it
precisely that the "left" has not avowed? The reality of what everyone saw
on TV? Unmanly grief? Compliance with Infinite Justice? Or something in
between? It is certainly possible to be very moved by grief for those
destroyed and to keep one's critical head on. I see no contradiction. I do
not have to admit a need to seek revenge nor salute the flag--which stands
for a number of like instances of total destruction, from Hiroshima to
Vietnam to the Highway of Death in the Gulf War--in order to argue for an
alternative to the war hysteria we are being swept up in.

Another mode of consideration would be: what is the legitimate scope of
state action? If states exist to protect, rather than aggrandize,
themselves, one may admit a degree of legitimacy to state response--but we
don't yet have any notion of what form that might take. If you read the NY
Times today, the issue is very much in debate, with Gulf War II one of the
options. In the face of that, there is an immediate need for public debate
on what counts as legitimate response. The "left"--the antiwar
tradition--certainly has it proper role here, but it is precisely that
legacy you accuse of incoherence. It is the US, I'm sure you are aware,
that invented total war with civilians as a military objective (Sherman's
march to the sea), gratuitous annihilation of civilian populations (the
A-bomb), and "collateral damage." What we just saw was the direct result of
US policy of ignoring and minimizing collateral damage in the Gulf War, and
a direct consequence of Ariel Sharon's aggression toward Palestinians.
Criticism of these policies ought to be the first thing one would propose
in response, rather than hand-wringing about the status of one's left
credentials, now that they have been placed under erasure. Barrett

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

The notion that one's changed feelings toward the flag might involve the
need to be comforted by a transitional object seems to me not a good
psychoanalytic account. A transitional object is a cat or blanket or thing
to suck on that mediates the absence of the caring parent. Freud, in *Group
Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego*--part of his meditation on the
psychology of nationalism post WWI--lays out a more relevant set of terms.
A flag is the symbol of a nation or group. What is the relation of self to
this symbol of the nation? It seems to me this is precisely where the
question of the flag rests--whether I identify with it or not. A terrific
account of aggressivity and group processes, with implications for the
nature of national identity, is Bill Bufords' Among the Thugs--on soccer
fans in the UK, but by extension, on the lack of self that leads to
aggression in numbers. I do agree, however, that the flag has been
displayed in a way that has more to do with mourning than with aggression
this past week--the flag is a substitute for a lost object. What,
precisely, is the nature of that object? Our sense of well being in the
world? A transitional object is not primarily described in the context of
mourning. Rather, as Freud saw it, there is a need to reencounter the
things of the world, one by one, when faced with a catastrophic loss. A
process of reintegration. Perhaps the flag is a step in that direction for
some, and the act of forgetting other political valences a part of the
process as well.

Hello. By way of indicating that we at Fence are all OK, hoping for the
best, and going forward with fall plans, I'm writing to tell you of our
many activities.

###First, Fence Books is happy to announce the winner of its first Fence
Modern Poets Series Prize.

The Red Bird, by Joyelle McSweeney of Iowa City, Iowa, was chosen by judge
Allen Grossman from a selection of eight finalists. The Red Bird will be
published in April, as will finalist manuscript Can You Relax in My House,
by Michael E. Craig. We are extremely pleased with both of these selections.

###Guidelines for the 2002 Alberta Prize and the Fence Modern Poets Series
are now available online (http://www.fencebooks.com) or
(http://www.fencemag.com) and by mail (send an SASE to the below address,
indicating which contest you are interested in--if both, say both).
Postmark deadline for the Alberta Prize is November 1st-30th, 2001; for the
Fence Modern Poets Series, postmark deadline is January 1st-31st, 2002.*

###Fence #8 will be published in late October, as will our first two Fence
Books titles: Zirconia, by Chelsey Minnis (winner of the 2001 Alberta
Prize) and Miss America, by Catherine Wagner. Fence/Fence Books is
delighted to announce a West Coast reading tour for these authors, also
including local Fence contributors. Please join us; please come and
introduce yourselves. We would be delighted to meet you.**

*Please note that in our contest guidelines we have specified that we
cannot process International Reply Coupons; this decision was made based on
our difficulty in handling these last year. We are a small organization and
find the extra trips to the post office and extra administrative work
engendered by IRCs to be onerous. However, the last thing we want to appear
right now is isolationist. We urge those abroad who are able to obtain US
postage easily to please do so ( http://www.stampsonline.com ); those for
whom it would be prohibitive we urge to not include an SASE at all and
simply to give us your email address so that we may notify you of receipt
and results thusly. For those without email we will go to the post office.

**Fence editor Rebecca Wolff (me) has a book of poems called Manderley
coming out simultaneously from U. of Illinois Press. For convenience and
fellow-feeling I have been included in several of the Fence Books readings.
(It's not often that one goes driving around the country,) For further

I want to pass along this recent Agamben translation, which clearly =
attends
to Taylor's earlier idea of a "reorienting a massive material apparatus
along entirely different lines", if from a another angle. I'm wondering =
what
listers think about Agamben's statement about the "production of
emergencies" here, especially in light of the "Infinite" nature of the
oncoming US response?
The translation is rough, so I'm including the original German at the
bottom.
Be well everyone, Andrew

On Security and Terror By Giorgio Agamben=20
(unauthorized translation by soenke.zehle@web.de, source: FAZ 09/20/01) =

Security as leading principle of state politics dates back to the the =
birth
of the modern state. Hobbes already mentions it as the opposite of =
fear,
which compels human beings to come together within a society. But not =
until
the 18th century does a thought of security come into its own. In a =
1978
lecture at the Coll=E9ge de France (which has yet to be published) =
Michel
Foucault has shown how the political and economic practice of the
Physiocrats opposes security to discipline and the law as instruments =
of
governance.=20
Turgot and Quesnay as well as Physiocratic officials were not primarily
concerned with the prevention of hunger or the regulation of =
production, but
wanted to allow for their development to then regulate and "secure" =
their
consequences. While disciplinary power isolates and closes off =
territories,
measures of security lead to an opening and to globalization; while the =
law
wants to prevent and regulate, security intervenes in ongoing processes =
to
direct them. In short, discipline wants to produce order, security =
wants to
regulate disorder. Since measures of security can only function within =
a
context of freedom of traffic, trade, and individual initiative, =
Foucault
can show that the development of security accompanies the ideas of
liberalism.=20
Today we face extreme and most dangerous developments in the thought of
security. In the course of a gradual neutralization of politics and the
progressive surrender of traditional tasks of the state, security =
becomes
the basic principle of state activity. What used to be one among =
several
definitive measures of public administration until the first half of =
the
twentieth century, now becomes the sole criterium of political =
legitimation.
The thought of security bears within it an essential risk. A state =
which has
security as its sole task and source of legitimacy is a fragile =
organism; it
can always be provoked by terrorism to become itself terroristic.=20
We should not forget that the first major organization of terror after =
the
war, the Organisation de l'Arm=E9e Secr=E8te (OAS), was established by =
a French
general, who thought of himself as a patriot, convinced that terrorism =
was
the only answer to the guerrilla phenomenon in Algeria and Indochina. =
When
politics, the way it was understood by theorists of the "science of =
police"
in the eighteenth century, reduces itself to police, the difference =
between
state and terrorism threatens to disappears. In the end security and
terrorism may form a single deadly system, in which they justify and
legitimate each others' actions.=20
The risk is not merely the development of a clandestine complicity of
opponents, but that the search for security leads to a world civil war =
which
makes all civil coexistence impossible. In the new situation created by =
the
end of the classical form of war between sovereign states it becomes =
clear
that security finds its end in globalization: it implies the idea of a =
new
planetary order which is in truth the worst of all disorders.=20
But there is another danger. Because they require constant reference to =
a
state of exception, measure of security work towards a growing
depoliticization of society. In the long run they are irreconcilable =
with
democracy.=20
Nothing is more important than a revision of the concept of security as
basic principle of state politics. European and American politicians =
finally
have to consider the catastrophic consequences of uncritical general =
use of
this figure of thought. It is not that democracies should cease to =
defend
themselves: but maybe the time has come to work towards the prevention =
of
disorder and catastrophe, not merely towards their control. On the =
contrary,
we can say that politics secretly works towards the production of
emergencies. It is the task of democratic politics to prevent the
development of conditions which lead to hatred, terror, and destruction =
-
and not to limit itself to attempts to control them once they have =
already
occurred.=20

=DCber Sicherheit und Terror / Von Giorgio Agamben=20
BODY:=20
Sicherheit als Leitbegriff staatlicher Politik ist so alt wie die =
Geburt des
modernen Staates. Schon bei Hobbes ist sie als Gegenbegriff zur Furcht =
zu
finden, die die Menschen zwingt, sich zur Gesellschaft =
zusammenzuschliessen.
Aber erst im achtzehnten Jahrhundert kommt das Sicherheitsdenken zur =
vollen
Entfaltung. Michel Foucault hat 1978 in einer immer noch nicht
ver=F6ffentlichten Vorlesung am College de France gezeigt, wie sich in =
der
politischen und =F6konomischen Praxis der Physiokraten die Sicherheit =
dem
Gesetz und der Disziplin als Instrument des Regierens entgegenstellt. =
F=FCr
Turgot und Quesnay wie auch f=FCr die physiokratischen Minister ging es =
nicht
darum, Hungersn=F6ten vorzubeugen oder der Produktion Vorschriften zu =
machen,
sondern deren Entwicklung zuzulassen, um dann die Folgen zu ste=FCrn =
und zu
"sichern". W=E4hrend die disziplinierende Macht isoliert und R=E4ume =
schlie=DFt,
f=FChren die Massnahmen der Sicherheit zur =D6ffnung und zur =
Globalisierung;
w=E4hrend das Gesetz vorbeugen und vorschreiben will, will die =
Sicherheit in
die laufenden Prozesse eingreifen, um sie zu lenken. Mit einem Wort, =
die
Disziplin will die Ordnung herstellen, die Sicherheit will die =
Unordnung
steuern. Weil die Massnahmen der Sicherheit nur unter der Voraussetzung
einer gewissen Freiheit des Verkehrs, des Handels und der =
Eigeninitiative
greifen, kann Foucault zeigen, da=DF ihre Entfaltung mit der =
Durchsetzung der
Ideen des Liberalismus einhergeht. Heute stehen wir vor den extremen =
und
gef=E4hrlichsten Entwicklungen dieses Sicherheitsdenkens. Im Laufe der
schrittweisen Neutralisierung der Politik und der fortschreitenden =
Preisgabe
traditioneller staatlicher Aufgaben dr=E4ngt sich die Sicherheit als
Grundprinzip staatlichen Handelns auf. Was noch bis zur ersten H=E4lfte =
des
zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts eine unter mehreren ausschlaggebenden =
Massnahmen
der =F6ffentlichen Verwaltung war, wird nun zum einzigen Kriterium =
politischer
Legitimation. Das Sicherheitsdenken bringt jedoch ein wesentliches =
Risiko
mit sich. Ein Staat, der als einzige Legitimation und als einzige =
Aufgabe
die Sicherheit hat, ist ein zerbrechlicher Organismus; er kann =
st=E4ndig vom
Terrorismus provoziert werden, selbst terroristisch zu werden. Man =
sollte
nicht vergessen, da=DF die erste grossangelegte Terrororganisation nach =
dem
Krieg, die Organisation de l'Armee Secrete (OAS), von einem =
franz=F6sischen
General aufgebaut wurde, der sich f=FCr einen Patrioten hielt und =
=FCberzeugt
war, da=DF die einzige Antwort auf das Ph=E4nomen der G=FCrrilla in =
Algerien und
Indochina der Terrorismus sei. Wenn Politik, wie die Theoretiker der
"Polizeiwissenschaft" im achtzehnten Jahrhundert sie verstanden, sich =
v=F6llig
auf Polizei reduziert, droht der Unterschied zwischen Staat und =
Terrorismus
zu verschwinden. Am Ende kann es so weit kommen, da=DF Sicherheit und =
Terror
ein einziges t=F6dliches System bilden, in dem sie ihre Handlungen
wechselseitig rechtfertigen und legitimieren.=20
Das Risiko liegt hierbei nicht nur darin, da=DF sich heimliche
Komplizenschaften zwischen beiden Gegnern einstellen, sondern da=DF die =
Suche
nach Sicherheit zu einem Weltb=FCrgerkrieg f=FChrt, der jedes =
zivilisierte
Zusammenleben unm=F6glich macht. In der ne=FCn Lage, die nach dem Ende =
der
klassischen Form des Krieges zwischen souver=E4nen Staaten entstanden =
ist,
wird also deutlich, da=DF die Sicherheit mit der Globalisierung an ihr =
Ziel
gelangt: Sie impliziert die Idee einer ne=FCn planetarischen Ordnung, =
die in
Wahrheit die schlimmste aller Unordnungen ist.=20
Aber es gibt eine weitere Gefahr. Insofern sie den da=FCrhaften Bezug =
auf
einen Notstand erfordern, wirken die Massnahmen der Sicherheit im Sinne
einer zunehmenden Entpolitisierung der Gesellschaft. Auf lange Sicht =
sind
sie unvereinbar mit der Demokratie.=20
Nichts ist daher notwendiger als eine Revision des Begriffs der =
Sicherheit
als Leitgedankens staatlicher Politik. Die europ=E4ischen und =
amerikanischen
Politiker m=FCssen endlich die katastrophalen Konseq=FCnzen bedenken, =
die ein
unkritischer Gebrauch dieser Denkfigur im globalen Masstab nach sich zu
ziehen droht. Nicht, da=DF Demokratien darauf verzichten m=FCssten, =
sich zu
verteidigen: Aber vielleicht ist die Zeit gekommen, an der Vorbeugung =
von
Unordnung und Katastrophen zu arbeiten, nicht nur an ihrer =
Beherrschung. Es
gibt heute Pl=E4ne f=FCr alle Arten von Notf=E4llen (=F6kologische, =
medizinische,
milit=E4rische), aber keine Politik, um ihnen vorzubeugen. Im =
Gegenteil, man
kann sagen, die Politik arbeite insgeheim daran, Notf=E4lle zu =
produzieren.
Aufgabe einer demokratischen Politik ist es, zu verhindern, da=DF =
Bedingungen
entstehen, die zu Ha=DF, Terror und Zerst=F6rung f=FChren - und sich =
nicht darauf
zu beschr=E4nken, sie erst dann beherrschen zu wollen, wenn sie bereits
entstanden sind.=20

italienischen
Ausgabe der Schriften Walter Benjamins und hat eine Reihe von dessen

achtziger
Jahre besch=E4ftigt sich Agamben vor allem mit politischer Philosophie. =

Would love to hear a few thoughts from others born in the 60s and 70s on
this, and just send out a few thoughts about how our generation is being
portrayed here and now. (On a first minor note: the news reports here show
the kids at UC doing protests and say "like those a generation ago". Um, the
Free Speech movement was more than a generation ago now, dudes. In the late
80s we had plenty of apartheid protests, bla bla bla.)
There's alot of talk of "genx"'s irony and how after last week we are
suddenly adults. This is really annoying. I may have a slightly different
take on things having grown up in the pinko enclave (note irony) of
Berkeley, but there are profound reasons for what is ***perceived*** as
apathy in this generation. Things aren't as easy (note irony) as when our
moms thought, hey maybe women should get paid the same as men for the same
work, etc. They haven't been. Everything has been framed as a pose, plus
everything is so deeply ambiguous and appallingly corrupted and thrillingly
complicated. Maybe this leaves our minds freer to cope, more open to vision.
I think in some ways it does and in some ways we have been apathetic. Well
that's all from me but just consider this a reminder that no generation is
"the greatest", and also (note irony) that generational proclamations are
really boring. Cheers Elizabeth

David,
    thanks for posting this.  My personal response is quite complicated and
i hope to get it written, but along with what I have observed here and in
many of the list responses my suggestion would be that the response is
likely to be more personal and heartfelt thanany encompassed within existing
idealogies.  I would encourage people there to stick if possible with a
broader base for responses if possible.

     If questioned about this by leaders there I do have all the credentials
of previous experiences to back this up.

please keep us postedon progress.

Dear List and Tom,


Like for many, the event and its aftermath created an instant documentary on
the meaning of being here, being "american" and there was more of it than
ever that I owned, most succinctly represented by the people on the plane
that crashed outside Pittsburgh who voted on what to do before acting.
Previously I'd always considered myself from NY or of american immigrant
stock, but that was as far as I'd go.  But one of the most upsetting
developments is this flag waving stuff by Tom and Todd Gitlin and all those
saying "I was a..." but now watch me wave.  Tonight W said America will
define our times not be defined by them.  Let us remember, that much of the
design of the fundamentalist rage was determined by colonialism and
imperialism.  Before jumping on every heart beat of US pride, will and
strength, please take a moment to consider the consequences of supressing
the pride, will and strength of the rest of the world.

Some Notes On the Unspeakable
       11 September 2001


What recourse do we have, we who work embedded so deeply in language, when
words fail? When they fail so completely and utterly, in confronting traged=
y
of such proportion. Is there anything which authorizes our speech, we who
remain outside the hole, the blank, utter, negation of those voices who
could speak, but cannot? No. That is impossible. For us and for them. There
is no possibility of speaking but from that position, and those voices are
silent. Where might hope lie for us? Circumscription, writing around a
wound, forms a cicatrice, a scar that forever marks the place of absence.
And yet there is the constant reflexive urge to fill this metaphoric hole
with language. Never mind that it cannot support such language, and that at
the same time such language occludes the space of horror, take its place,
and that this pure negation frames every language. Even our perceptions, as
they are before=8Bor at least different from=8Blanguage are compromised. I =
stood
on my roof watching through binoculars the fall of the northernmost tower.
For some minutes before it collapsed I saw what looked like dust. Like ther=
e
was dust crumbling from the edges of the building. It wasn=B9t until four d=
ays
later that I realized that it was not dust, but people. So even at the very
moment of perception, or perhaps it is in that gap between perception and
cognition, where pure perception has not yet made itself into the world, no=
t
yet entered into a relation with the possibility of knowing =8Bwhen it is
attenuated, momentarily absolved from commitment to the horror=8Bthat we ar=
e
closest to the event. And for the rush of language that inundates that
space, how much of it is clich=E9, familiar tropes, truisms that order not =
the
event itself=8Bwhich cannot be domesticated=8B nor even our relation to it,=
 but
rather our protection from it. When the first airplane hit, it was broadcas=
t
almost immediately. Young children in one of the schools closest to the sit=
e
cheered and laughed, applauding this incredible image=8Bhow could they not?
The only precedent for such an image was in cinema or on television, where
everyone tacitly knows that, with all of the weapons fired, no one is reall=
y
killed. Moments later these same children witnessed, out the windows of
their classroom, the bodies of people who had jumped hit the ground,
literally exploding on impact. There is no way to suture these two events
together in any sensible way. They remain an aporia, an impossibility that
one cannot, and yet must, work through. The work of mourning. One of my
students asked if, within the framework of this intentional act of
terrorism, whether the composition of the act=8Ba plane flying down 5th Ave=
nue
into the first tower, with a second plane, from another direction, hitting
the second tower half an hour later=8Bwas not also intentional, so as to ha=
ve
produced the clearest images of terror. I didn=B9t know how to answer this.
Our city is already composed as an image, in a sense, there is something
cinematic from the start. Perhaps terror always composes itself as an image=
,
and that this was an opportunistic instance of that reflex. How many times
did we hear that it was =8Clike a movie,=B9 or a =8Cspecial effect.?=B9 And=
 how was
it like a movie in the very moments that it unfolded? It is astonishing to
think of the network of people, stationary, fixed, in wahtever proximity to
the event, in front of their television sets. It was a movie, coextensive
with the horror of its actuality, a film or covering membrane, something
with which one could think, because any closer and thought too disappears.
The question of the precessionary comes up here. America has had its
=8Cwake-up call=B9 is another statement that we continue to hear. What does=
 it
mean? That we have finally learned, in the worst way, the meaning of
=8Cglobalism,=B9 and the hegemonic phantasm of our daily life now has to ad=
mit
that other hells punctuate the world, and have done so for a long time,
whether it be the thousands of people =8Cmissing=B9 in Latin America, or Bu=
rma,
or Algeria, and the list goes on. Have we backed into a world different
beyond our imagining? I don=B9t know. The world is different, to be sure. T=
he
etymology of the word =8Caftermath=B9 is useful to note: moving away, or mo=
ving
on. Is there a resonance of mathesis, or working, making (an image)? And no=
t
only in images, but in judgements and acts? The wort theory in its original
sense authorized the passage from event into language such that the truth o=
f
an event could be ascertained, judgements rendered and appropriate actions
taken. Our task is to think outside the event=8Bthere is no other place=8Ba=
nd to
think through our judgements and actions so that this sort of thing, on any
scale, in any place, for any reason, cannot happen again. There will be the
inevitable retaliations, there is no question. And there will be
retaliations to retaliations. We have not only found ourselves within a
probabalistic total war=8Bwhere unspeakable things can happen anywhere, any
time=8Bbut we recognize that we have been within a probabalistic total war =
for
some time now. What do we do? Adorno=B9s chilling question, how does one wr=
ite
lyric poetry after Auschwitz has haunted the last century, and has not
passed away. Lyotard speaks, and then writes =B3Discussion, or how do you
phrase =8Cafter Auschwitz?=B9=B2 It is in the phrases which circulate aroun=
d
negation that the work lies. Discussion, dialektike, is the ground for
community, and it is within communities that the phrasing of events takes
place, takes up the task of mourning, which must be a positive task. Phrase=
s
are mediated. On has only to reflect on the order of repetitions of images,
statements, phrases, to see an emergent pattern, a possible and perhaps at
times opportunistic persuasion. The notion of a =8Ccell structure=B9 for
example, dates from the period of the Russian anarchists of the late 19th
century. Is this really how the perpetrators of this inhuman act worked in
our world? And under the necessity of our covert forces =8Cgetting dirty=B9=
 in a
commensurate fashion have we instituted a structure of secrecy which will
totally deconstruct the traditional freedom of the press? Does the reflexiv=
e
anxiety about this event, so close, produce a more and more normative
discourse about fighting another =8Cgood war=B9 which is greatly at odds wi=
th
the world as it is?  What do we do now?

My heart rouses
        thinking to bring you news
             of something
that concerns you
        and concerns many men.  Look at
              what passes for the new.
You will not find it there but in
        despised poems.
                 It is difficult
to get the news from poems
          yet men die miserably every day
                  for lack
of what is found there.

interesting that this hould appear now, Alan.  Recent events have sent me
back to Krucheonik and Michaux with a view to putting shatters back
together, especially after Stockhausen's provacative but poorly timed
cooment.

I made myself feel better for a little while today, twice. In the
evening I got to hear Nicole Brossard read. Earlier in the day I went
back and reoponed Rae Armantrout's Made to Seem. After all the
language of warscarepolitics of the past week, what a blessing to
remember that words can be so well respected, so nicely cared for, so
near to the world and the heart at the same time. So exact. So
subtle. I am thankful as can be that I decided to open that book
again. Maybe that is a great occupation for poetry. We do have to
come back and read about our warscarepolitical world and do something
about it. But we can, every day, find poems such as Rae's.

The events of September 11th have been called `unspeakable.'
As always--it falls to poets to speak the unspeakable. On that
day we were preparing a web page for the journal UR-VOX.
Instead of what was planned, www.urvox.net will for now be
dedicated to poems  that engage with the catastrophes, written
by our contributors and others in affinity with them. First poems
in place are by Will Alexander, Lee Ballentine, Charles Borkhuis,
Adam Cornford, and Spencer Selby.

Call for Submissions
Teachers & Writers Magazine is seeking submissions from writers and teachers
at all levels for its next issue. In the aftermath of the World Trade Center
attacks, we would like to know of poems or other literary works that you
turned to in this time of tragedy-for solace, insight, comfort, and hope.
You can just send us the texts, with authors, titles, and sources, but we
ask that you also explore in a few paragraphs why these pieces affected you,
and if possible, how you might share them with students. If you have
classroom experiences to relate, or poems or responses by students, we would
like to receive these as well.
Literature is one thing that can offer us consolation, helping us to
overcome our mutual grief, sorrow, pain, and fear. The opportunity we have
as teachers, to help the younger ones among us, is another. Please join us
in this modest effort to share our strengths and wisdom.
We would like to receive submissions as soon as possible, no later than
October 3.
Thank you,

Surely one of the most enlightened & unbiased responses to appear in this
discussion group, & exhibits the great wisdom gap between poet-intellectuals
-- forever beating around the bush, word slinging -- & awakened beings.
Worth rereading.

[Pardon for the length -- just read the last paragraph or so if you're
bored... ]

Hi Ron and others,

Not sure what I can add to the voluminous debate, and pardon if I repeat
some points made earlier.

I attended an anti-war meeting yesterday in the penthouse of a building on
42nd Street.  I don't actually know who the organizers were, but
representatives of several New York coalitions were present.

I was disappointed by the apparent lack of "withness" by many of the
atttendees -- "habits" of thinking, many of which seemed rooted in quite
ingrained attitudes that hadn't seen the light of day for decades -- were
everywhere, with many grabbing the mike simply to state positions that were
already long agreed upon.

An hour and a half was spent just getting the 4 or 5 points of agreement
hacked out, some of which were as basic (but linguistically challenged) as
"Peace through justice."

Nonetheless, I was impressed with the organization, and the hundreds there
gave me confidence that, when the time comes, those hundreds could become
thousands, and thousands millions.  Most people of my generation who have
remained somewhat on the margins of political activity would not have
thought such a thing possible so easily.

With this in mind (since public opinion plays such a large role in Ron's
post) I'd like to argue a few points:   RS writes: "Everyone has had the opportunity to see over 5,000 people, most
of them the most ordinary folks in the world, die very horrible deaths. This
total is more than the attack on Pearl Harbor and the sinking of the Titanic
combined - this is a visceral shock to the system that we will all be
suffering effects from for years."

I would add that several million New Yorkers and New Jerseyans saw this
event happen right in front of their faces, not on television -- I'd say
only a handful of the many I've talked to didn't see it happen first-hand.
Nonetheless, I'm convinced that the choreographing of the attack was
intended to bring people out of their homes and onto their rooftops -- to
demoralize, to anchor our thoughts in grief, to shock us and make us afraid,
and to leave behind a lingering depression.  And so, on some level, I would
like to reject this shock and not use it as a strong reference point in my
thinking in terms of personal emotion.  This seems to be the intention of
the terrorists, and a first step might be to reject it.

As well, I agree with those who think comparisons to Pearl Harbor and the
Titanic are not relevant -- the only similiarities there are speed (in the
first case) and structural inadequacies of a machine (in the second).  I
think it is because these events have taken on mythic proportions in the
public's eye (each having a movie in the past 5 years) and are thereby even
celebrated as cathartic that they are recalled, whereas I see this event as
the first in a chain of events, and that most Americans without this sort of
(perhaps depressing) imagination will see it this way, too, quite soon.  I'm
not sure we'll be able, a few years from now, to distinguish this shock to
the system from the ones that are ahead of us.

RS writes: What would happen to any government that did NOT respond
militarily to such an attack on civilians on its soil? Frankly, it would
collapse. Bush would be impeached or worse. Politicians are for the most
part followers, craven followers at that, and the reaction by the
professional pols has been completely predictable.

This, I think, is a highly arguable point.  But what I find most bothersome
about it is that it suggests an argument for symbolic militaristic action
for the sake of domestic concerns and stability, and that strikes me as
exactly the wrong way to go.  The United States is a little too handy at
making symbolic relatiatory strikes when far less than domestic stability as
at stake, actions that, consequently, kill thousands more than died in the
towers, and of reporting it as they see fit.  I'm not being "anti-American"
here, and I am certainly in favor of some significant action, but we must
avoid anything that is purely (or even remotely) of symbolic value.  RS writes: Does anybody anywhere honestly think that this network, whether
or not we inscribe bin Laden's name in as the CEO, will not, at some future
moment, do something as bad or worse if it is not broken up? Do we not think
that it would use a nuclear weapon if it had a chance? Anthrax?

This network has survived an incredible amount of poverty, bad reputation,
closed borders, etc.etc., not to mention US and other gunships.  A network
is not like a state -- we've heard it over and over again.  And this culture
of martyrdom seems able to rejuvinate itself from, literally, out of the
ground -- who is to say that even the distant myth of the martyr against
America would not inspire someone several generations from now from taking
up the old cause?

Yes, greater attacks could happen, but I'm more interested now in whether
there is any sort of logic to these activities -- who is supposed to gain
were there to be a nuclear bomb attack against the U.S.?  If we can deduce
this logic, could it lead us to a sense of security again?  (More on this
"logic" below.)
 RS writes: Does anybody honestly think that if America were to somehow
"improve its behavior" toward people of the Third World, that this would
eliminate the impetus behind these attacks? That it could do so quickly
enough to forestall future assaults?

One thing worth mentioning in this context (and I'm certainly no Middle East
expert) is that prior to the Persian Gulf war a jihad had never been
declared on the United States.  Jihads were declared on Israel and the
Soviet Union, but not this country, though now we are positioning ourselves
as the polar opposites of radical Muslims in terms of "values".  According
to John Miller (and I confess that I got this info from David Letterman last
night -- remember, I only have one tv channel!), bin Laden himself (at least
in 98) had three specific points of contention with the United States:
support of Israel, the air-bases in Saudi Arabia and the sanctions/no fly
zone against Iraq.  This is not to say that he's not an egotistical violent
maniac, but that I'm less sure than I was maybe a week ago that something
like a fundamentalist Islamic attitude toward the American way of life (gay
marriages, Coca Cola or "bare midriffs" as Marjorie Perloff mentioned) is
somewhere near the heart of this.  I could be fooling myself, but there
could be a logic (i.e. consistency) to this -- the Taliban's request that
bin Laden leave the country, for instance, suggests a sort of foreign policy
move that is not off the radar, and was probably unthinkable three or so
days ago.  And even if it seems a distant memory, there was a fairly long
cease-fire in Israel until Sharon moved in with his (again, symbolic) act.
I'm certainly not suggesting that there be diplomacy here -- it would be
kind of laughable, and if the Afghanis learned anything from, say, North
Korea, it could go on for a while -- but the steps that have to be taken,
should they be militaristic, would have to be so careful as to not create a
"new world order" that would just leave the old antipathies in place.

In fact, shaking things up too much right now might cut off certain supplies
of information -- imagine what a few months looking through the vaults of
Pakistan's government files on terrorism would show us now?  RS writes: Does anybody honestly think that the U.S. could do # 3 without
literally abandoning Israel?

I assume you mean #4 here, since #3 doesn't have the U.S. doing anything?
Anyway, putting "improve its behavior" in double quotes may not give enough
detail to that particular issue.  Certainly "abandoning Israel" is not an
answer, but nonetheless some change in this policy strikes me as necessary,
since it is what supplies the fuel for the sort of coalition that people
like Hussein or bin Laden want in the Middle East.  Again, I'm no expert,
but the recent history of the moves the U.S. has made in support of Israel
-- the racism conference is obviously a touchstone -- WITHOUT anything like
public debate is troublesome.  There's something automatic about it that I
don't understand and we have been far too passive about.  I think, in this
time of crisis, that it is legitimate to rethink this policy in a way that
doesn't "abandon" Israel but put some serious pressure for changes.  RS writes: Can anybody here imagine a U.S. electoral politician advocating
some version of #4? See that last comment under #1 again.

Don't know.  I do remember Clinton in occasional speeches talking about
"that great culture of Islam" and things like that, and though it might not
have had anything to do with policy, there could have been the attempt to
change to tone of one's approach to Islam, as less the "other" and more the
partner in civilization.  But I can't comment here -- I just hope anything's
possble.  Certainly, right now, this seems impossible, but think of how
demonized the Japanese and Asians were even before WWII.
 RS writes: Even if those last three points were politically do-able in the
near future, is there anybody who cannot imagine what THAT ensuing war would
look like?

You lose me here.  What ensuing war -- the blueprints for war are always
there (again, think North Korea).  We can only do our best to move in a
direction we think is safe.  In any case, don't quite follow you here.

My sense, in terms of the "popular will" of the people, is that it will
change dramatically once the first bombs drop, and so will the opinion of
our European allies.  It's strikes me as quite easily possible that we
become isolated if the attacks that we are sure to make do not have anything
suggesting results in the first weeks.  If this is to be a long-term version
of the lingering sanctions/war with Iraq, then I don't see memories of the
WTC attacks being enough to maintain support around the globe.  The United
States will look like the dominant force again, and hence unsympathetic (of
course, Russia and France will have their own reasons for continuing -- but
if there are no visible results?  If you can't even name the terrorists you
are supposedly killing, how can you deduce progress?)

There's also the issue of Pakistan -- there is already sizable bin Laden
support there, and their undemocratically elected general, for whom I feel
some sympathy, could be sitting on top of a volcano.  Bin Laden is like a
folk hero in some areas there.

Is it possible (re: that the leadership now is totally inadequate) that
Powell is aware of all of this?  I'm amazed that the media is not reporting
his comments more -- what he has said concerning this campaign is the only
thing that strikes me as revealing about what is about to happen, and if the
Times is reliable on this, he is at least being cautious, and may be trying
to reason out what, indeed, kind of "war" this is supposed to be.  I don't
get the sense that he has any love of war, despite his being a soldier, but
that's just my impression.  I'm almost tired of knocking on Bush -- he's
clearly an idiot with a stupid grin -- so where is the reporting on Powell's
statements (URLs please).

RS writes: It's a rhizome, almost like the point-to-point computing model
one associates with post-Napster MP3 ripping, while the U.S. military' s
experience is telling it to hunt for a mainframe somewhere.

We've had no success with post-Napster ripping.  But hackers always rise up
again.  The only way to get rid of them is to bribe them, hire them, or find
people who are smarter that render their activities irrelevant.  In any
case, along the lines of this analogy, certainly a total transformation of
the nature of army intelligence is necessary -- perhaps a little time to
figure out what these transformations would be might help.  Didn't we wait 6
months before entering the war after Pearl Harbor?    Consequently, I'm not sure whom you could target in Afghanistan that is not
a "civilian," since there are enough rebel forces there to start up the
civil war again, and though I have no love for the Taliban, knocking them
out wholesale at a time like this would be sending the whole region into
such a state of instability that I don't see any good being done.  There are
just too many variables right now, and if there's one thing that the
terrorists have proved, it's that our looking toward the "macro" too much --
thinking we have the smarts to take in such a wide range of facts, and that
we can stay at an arm's length from any violence that ensues -- just leaves
the "micro" open for anyone, especially trained bandits.  Anyway, to bring this to a close, I'm wondering if there is something that
is peculiar to poets use of language -- the language of fact -- in a poetic
or emotional fashion that might be useful here.  It's one thing to
deconstruct or approve/disapprove of symbols, but I think it's quite another
to convince a populace that is gorged on symbols and emotionalism to somehow
find security in what might seem bureaucratic methods in a time a crisis.
To go back to Guiliani again, it's amazing what he's been able to do in
talking to New York without recourse to anything like symbolic language --
most of what he's done, outside of some prepared speeches (like at the
ceremony for the promotion of the firemen) was to present the goings-on of
the day and to answer questions when posed.  We simply do not have any
national-level politicians that are able to do anything like this, or to see
three years ahead and wonder what the world might be like after this
campaign is over, if indeed it is over then.  Public debate and speculation
-- from the right and left (yes, both are needed) -- would be the healthiest
thing right now if we don't want the president simply responding to polls
and his stupid cabinet.

I wish I had a grand conclusion for those of you who followed through this
email.  Don't have one.

Take care,
Brian

Interview with Robert Fisk at Beirut
                      Airport in Lebanon

It sometimes comes down to the question of why
when some people have brown eyes and darker skin, their
lives seem to be worth less than westerners

Radio New Zealan (ZMagazine)

Hill: Can I talk to you about Osama Bin Laden? I
don't know whether you are in favour of him becoming
public enemy number one at the moment but I do know that
you have met him and I wonder if you could give me
some kind of insight into, first of all, is he capable of
this.

Fisk: Well, I've been trying to explain this in my
own paper, the London Independent over the last few
days and I'm not sure. We haven't actually seen the
evidence that directly links him to not just an atrocity
but a crime against humanity that took place in New York and
Washington. On the other hand, the Afghan connection
seems to be fairly strong.

Could he have done it? He certainly hasn't condemned it
although he denies being involved. The first time,
no the second time I met him in Afghanistan when he was
there with his armed fighters, I asked him if he had
been involved in an attack on American troops at Al
Hoba, in Saudi Arabia which had just taken place - 24
American soldiers had been killed - and he said no, it was
not his doing, he was not responsible. He admitted that he
knew two or three men who have since been executed,
beheaded, by the Saudi authorities.

He then said, I did not have the honour to participate
in this operation. In other words, he approved of it.

Now,  you can go on saying that kind of thing - he did,
several times over about other episodes later. At some
point you begin to say, "Come off it Bin Laden, surely you
are saying there's a connection, but he's never said or
admitted responsibility for any such event and he's denied
specifically the atrocities in the United States.

Is he capable of it? Look, I'll give you one tiny
example. The second time I met him in Afghanistan, four
years ago, at the top of a mountain, it was cold and in the
morning  when I woke in the camp tent, I had frost in my
hair. He walked into the tent I was sitting in and sat down
opposite me, cross-legged on the floor and noticed
in the school bag I usually carry in rough country to
keep things in, some Arabic-language newspapers and he seized
upon these and went to the corner of the tent with a
sputtering oil lamp and devoured the contents.

For 20 minutes, he ignored us, he ignored the gunman
sitting in the tent, he ignored me and he didn't
even know, for example, that it was stated in one of
the stories in the newspaper that the Iranian foreign
minister had just visited Riyadh, his own country, Saudi
Arabia, well, his until he lost his citizenship. So he
seemed to me at the time to be very isolated, a cut off man,
not the sort of person who would press a button on a
mobile phone and say, "Put plan B into action".

So I don't think you can see this as a person who
actually participates in the sense of planning,
step-by-step,  what happens in a nefarious attack. In other words, I
doubt very much if he said, "Well, four airplanes, five
hijackers, etc.". But he is a person that has a very large
following, particularly in the rather sinister Jihadi
community or culture of Pakistan. And there is such anger in
the Middle East at the moment about the American' s policies
here and whether it be the deaths of tens of thousands
of children in Iraq, which Osama Bin Laden has spoken
about, whether it be continued occupation and
expansion of Jewish settlements in Arab land which he's also
spoken about, whether it be about the continued
dictatorships, Arab dictatorships, which are supported in large
part by the west, especially in the Gulf area, about which
Osama Ben Laden has spoken about and condemned, I think
you find in this region, enough people who admire what
he says, almost to conspire amongst themselves
without involving him, in the kind of bombing attacks that
we've seen in Saudi Arabia and I suppose it's
conceivable, in the atrocities in the United States.

But if you're looking for direct evidence, if
you're looking for a fingerprint, all I can say is, the moment I
heard about the World Trade Center attacks, I saw the
shadow of the Middle East hanging over them. As for the
fingerprint of Bin Laden, I think that's a
different matter.
We haven't seen it yet. We may. Perhaps the
Americans can produce the evidence but we haven't seen it
yet.

Hill: The corollary of that, of course, is that
should they decide to strike against Bin Laden, it will do no
good because, you know, there will be a thousand, a
million more, waiting to carry on doing the same thing,
will they not?


Fisk: Yes this is the problem. It is very easy to
start a war, or to declare war, or to say you are at war
and quite another thing to switch it off. And after all,
let's face it, this is a declaration of war primarily against the
United States. But once America takes up the opponent's
role, saying we will retaliate, then you take the risk
of further retaliation against you and further retaliation by
you and so on.

This is the trap that Ariel Sharon, the Israeli
prime minister, has got himself involved in Israel with
the Palestinians because when the Palestinians send a
suicide bomber wickedly, for example into a pizzeria and
kill many innocent Israelis, the Israelis feel a need to
retaliate so they fire tank shells or helicopters fire American
missiles into a police post. Then a murder squad, or a
helicopter fires a missile into a car of a man who the
Israelis believe have plotted bombing. Then the Palestinians
retaliate by sending another suicide bomber and so on and so
forth.

It's one thing to use this rhetoric, like "rooting
out the weed of world terror", "dead or alive", "a
crusade" - my goodness me, that's a word that Mr Bush has been
using - not a word that's likly to encourage much
participation on the American side in the Arab world because the
word, crusade, is synonymous here with Christians
shedding Muslim blood in Jerusalem in 1099 and Jewish blood
actually, historically.

So, the real question is, what lies behind this
rhetoric? Is there any serious military thinking going on? If
so, are we talking about the kind of blind, indiscriminate
attack which will only provoke more anger among Arabs, perhaps
to overthrow their own regimes which Mr Bin Laden
will be very happy to see, or are we talking about special
forces seizing people, taking them out of Afghanistan,
trying to have some kind of international criminal court
where we  could actually see justice done as opposed to just
liquidation and murder squads setting out to kill
killers.

Hill: George Bush, I suppose is entitled to his
internal physical needs - the needs of Americans - to put
out bellicose rhetoric, such as "the new war on
terrorism", or "we want Osama Bin Laden dead or alive" and so on,
but that he will do remains entirely obscure at the
moment, doesn't it?



Fisk: Yes, yes it does. You see, I can understand
-anyone should be able to understand - not only how
appalled Americans are about what happened, in
such an awesome way - the images of those aircraft flying
through the skin of the World Trade Center and
exploding are utterly unforgettable. For the rest of our
lives we will remember that. And I think therefore the anger of
Americans is perfectly understandable and revenge is a
kind of justice, isn' t it, but these days we have
to believe in the rule of law.

Once or twice you hear Colin Powell talking about
justice  and law but then you hear President Bush using the
language of Wild West movies. And that is very
frightening because I don't think that NATO is
going to support America in a blind and totally
indiscriminate attack in the Middle East. And the other question is, how
do you make your strike massive enough to suit the crime.
Afghanistan, after all, is a country in total
ruins, it was occupied by the Russians for 10 years which is why
it is seeded with 10 million mines - I mean it, 10
million mines, more that one tenth of all the land mines in the
world are in Afghanistan. So any idea of America sending its
military across Afghanistan is a very, very dangerous
operation in a country where America has no friends.

It is very significant - though it's been largely
missed, I noticed by press and television around the world -
but just two days before the attacks on Washington and
New York, Shah Massoud, the leader of the opposition
in Afghanistan, the only military man to stand up to
the Taliban, and the only friend of the west, was
himself assassinated by two Arab suicide bombers - men
posing as journalists, by the way. I've been asking
myself over the last two days, and I have no proof of this
whatsoever, merely a strong suspicion, whether in
fact, that assassination wasn't in a sense a code for
people in  the United States to carry out atrocities which we
saw last Tuesday. I don't know, but certainly if
America wants to go into Afghanistan, one of the key elements,
even with a special forces raid, is to have friends in
the country, people who are on your side. [But they]
have just been erased, in fact erased two days before
the bombings in America, and I find that is a very,
very significant thing.



Hill: If one went to these people, if one went to
bin Laden or any other, if one went to the Jihadians in
Pakistan and said, "What do you guys want?" what would they
say?

Fisk: Well, you would hear a list of objectives
which will be entirely unacceptable to the west or in many
cases, to any sane person here.

Hill: What do they want?

Fisk: Well, look, what you have to understand is,
what they want and what most Muslims in the region want
is not necessarily the same thing but they are
trading and treading on the waters of injustice in the region.
But what they want, they will tell you, is they want
shariat imposed on all Muslim states in the region, they want
total withdrawal of western forces from the Arab gulf
region.
They ask, for example, why does America still have
forces in Saudi Arabia 10 years after the Gulf War, after
which they promised they would immediately withdraw
those forces?

Why are American forces in Kuwait? Well, we know
the American answer is that Saddam Hussein remains a
danger. Well, that might be a little bit of a
dubious claim now. And why are American forces exercising in
Egypt?  Why are American jets allowed to use Jordan? What
are they doing in Turkey? On top of that, they will
demand an end to Israeli occupation of Arab land.

But you have to remember that when you go to one
end of the extreme, like the most extreme of the
Jihadi culture in Pakistan, you are going to hear demands that
will never be met. But nonetheless, and this is the point,
they feed on a general unease about injustice in the region
which is associated with the west which many, many Arab
Muslims - millions of them - will feel.

So, this goes back to the Bin Laden culture. It
does mean, I haven't met a single Arab in the last
week, who doesn't feel revulsion about what has happened in
the United States. But quite a few of them would say,
and one or two have, if you actually listen to what
Bin Laden demands, he asks questions that it would be
interesting to hear the answers to. What are the Americans
still doing in the Gulf? Why does the United States
still permit Israel to build settlements for Jews, and Jews
only, on Arab land? Why does it still permit thousands of
children to die under UN sanctions? And UN sanctions are
primarily imposed by western powers.

So, it's not like you have a simple, clear picture
here. But where you have a large area of the earth, where
there is a very considerable amount of injustice, where the
United States is clearly seen as to blame for some of it,
then the people in the kind of Jihadi culture - the
extremists, terrorists, call them what you like - are going to
be able to find a society in which they can breathe, and
they do.

My point all along is, if there is going to be a
military operation to find the people responsible for the
World Trade Center and for the people who support them
and for those who harbour them - I'm using the words
of the State Department, the President, the
Vice-President, Secretary of State Colin Powell - then I believe
that the wisest and most courageous thing that the
Americans can do, is to make sure that it goes hand-in-hand with
some attempt to rectify some of the injustices, present
and historic in this region.

That could actually do what President Bush claims
he wants, that is, end "terrorism" in this region.
But you see, I don't think Mr Bush is prepared to put his
politics where he's prepared to point his missiles. He won't do
that.  He only wants a military solution. And military
solutions in the Middle East never, ever work.

Hill: Because it's like a tar baby. I mean as soon
as the United States undertakes a military solution, then
a thousand more will instantly join the Jihadi or
Bin Laden because, there you go, the United States has
proved itself to be the great Satan once again.

Fisk: Well, there is a self-proving element to
that for them, yes, but again, you see, the point is, I
said before, that Bin Laden's obsession with overthrowing the
local pro-American regime has been at the top of his
list of  everything he's said to me in three separate
meetings in  Sudan and two in Afghanistan. And I suspect, and I
don't know if he's involved in this, but if he was - or
even if he wasn't - he may well feel the more bloody and the
more indiscriminate the American response is, the
greater the chance that the rage and the feeling of anger
among ordinary Arabs who are normally very docile
beneath their various dictatorships, will boil over and start to
seriously threaten the various pro-western regimes in the
region, especially those in the Arabian Gulf.

And that is what he's talked about. And indeed, Mr
Mubarek of Egypt, not you might think, a great
conceptual thinker, two weeks' ago, only a few
days before the World Trade Center bombing, and it's
always interesting to go back before these events to see
what people said, warned what he called "an explosion
outside the region", very prescient of him and he also
talked about the danger for the various Arab governments
and regimes - he didn't call himself a dictator,
though effectively he is - if American policy didn' t
change. And indeed, he sent his Foreign Minister to Washington
to complain that the Egyptian regime itself could be
in danger unless American policy changed. And what
was the Foreign minister told? He was told to go back
to Cairo and tell Mr Mubarek that it will be very easy for
Dick Cheney to go to Congress and to cut off all
American aid to Egypt.


Hill: The trouble with arguing, as you do, as many
other people do, that, you know, 1800 people were killed
in Sabra and Shatila, maybe half a million people
have died in Iraq as a result of the sanctions, how many
Palestinians have died as a result of the Israeli attacks, it
begins to sound like moral relativism in some peculiar way.
I talked to David Horovitz [editor, Jerusalem Report]
earlier this morning. You won't be surprised to hear that he
disagrees with a lot of the things you say. And he said,
look, this terrorist attack on the United States last week
was beyond the pale, was unacceptable, cannot be
compared with anything else. This is it. How do you respond
to that?

Fisk: I'm not surprised that David, who I know
quite well, would say that. I don't think it's a question of
moral relativism. When you live in this region I go to
New York and I've driven past the World Trade Center many
times.  This is familiar architecture for me too, and
familiar people, but when you live in this region, it isn't
about moral relativism, it sometimes comes down to the
question of why when some people have brown eyes and darker
skin, their lives seem to be worth less than westerners.

Let's forget Sabra and Shatila for the moment and
remember that on a green light from Secretary of
State Alexander Haig, as he then was, Israel invaded
Lebanon and in the bloody months of July and August,
around 17,500 people, almost all of them civilians - this
is almost three times the number killed in the World Trade
Center -were killed. And there were no candlelight vigils
in the United States, no outspoken grief, all that
happened was a State Department call to both sides to exercise
restraint.

Now, it isn't a question of moral relativism, it
isn't a question in any way of demeaning or reducing the
atrocity which happened - let's call it a crime against
humanity which it clearly was - is it possible then to say
well, 17,500 lives, but that was in a war and it was far
away and anyway they were Arabs which is the only way I
can see you dismiss the argument that, hang on a
minute, terrible things have happened out here too. That
does not excuse what happened in the United States. It
doesn't justify by a tiny millimetre anything that
happened there but we've got to see history, even the recent
history of this region if we are going to look seriously at
what happened in the United States.

Hill: That's like setting out on a marathon
though. I mean, of course David Horovitz says, look, we made the
Palestinians a fantastic offer and they turned it down.
What more can we do? They keep coming at us. We're
trying, we're trying, we're trying. If you say,
yes

Fisk: Wait a second, there's an inaccuracy in
this, and this is not meant to be a criticism of David, this
is my view, they were not made a great offer, they were
not offered 96% of the West Bank, they were offered
46% roughly, because they were not being offered
Jerusalem or the area around it, or the area taken illegally
into the new Jerusalem and its municipality, or certain
settlements elsewhere, and they were to have a military buffer
zone that would further reduce the so-called 96%. It
was not a good offer to the Palestinians. You see, it has
become part of a narrative to get away from the reasons
for injustice and not to deal with these issues.

Hill: I didn't reproduce it in order to say, it
was a fantastic  offer. I did it to illustrate that very point,
that there are narratives going on and the narratives are of
different pages, different books, different libraries and
they are getting increasingly different. I can't see how we
can ever align those narratives and it's getting
harder and harder. How do we do it?



Fisk: Well, I think this is wrong. I think I
disagree with you. Look, you can't say that you don't understand
the narrative of children dying in Iraq. Nobody is
going around claiming that they are not dying. They are. They
clearly are. And if they were, and I'm going to stick my
neck out, if they were western children, believe me, they
would not be dying.

 Now this is a major problem. Again, you see,
anyone who tries to argue this, then you get smeared with,
"O, you are on Saddam Hussein's side". Now Saddam is a
wicked, unpleasant, dirty dictator. But the fact remains,
there are children dying. And if they were western children
I do not believe they would be. And this is a major
problem.

And many, many Arabs put this point of view
forward, not in hating the United States, but simply saying,
why? And of course why is one of the questions you are not
supposed to ask in this region is about the
motives of the people who committed this mass murder in the
United States. Actually, I have to point out, they
haven't told us, have they, the people behind this haven't even
bothered, they've just given us this theatre of
mass murder, which is the most disgusting thing.

But you've got to come back and realise, these
things don't happen in isolation. These 20 suicide
bombers did not get up in the morning and say, let's go hijack
some planes. Nor did the people who organised it and
funded it.  They knew they were doing it in a certain climate.
Otherwise it would never have been able to happen.

That is the problem. That is why we need to get at the
question, why.

Hill: It's very nice to talk to you. We hope to do
it again soon. Thank-you, Robert Fisk.

PROMOTION


As the United States prepares for war in the wake of last week's terrorist
attacks, Pentagon leaders have authorized each service secretary to suspend
military discharges -- including those based on a service member's
disclosure of homosexuality.

Major James P. Cassella, a spokesman for the Department of Defense told the
San Francisco Chronicle, in a report published on Wednesday, that a
"stop-loss" order has been authorized, allowing leaders of the military
services to call a stop to discharges.

The last time a stop-loss order took effect was during the Persian Gulf War
under President George H.W. Bush in 1991.

Casella noted, however, that the "don't ask, don't tell" policy enacted by
President Clinton in 1993 is still in effect. "Gays and lesbians would be
allowed to serve during any war, just as they do now," he said, "as long as
they remain in compliance with the homosexual conduct policy."

C. Dixon Osburn, executive director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Network (SLDN), said any stop-loss order would be "explicit recognition by
the Pentagon that gays and lesbians can serve their country, and do so with
honor and distinction."

Osburn added that during the stop-loss order implemented for the Gulf War,
gay and lesbian discharges dropped "significantly."

The discharges increased, however, once the Gulf War service members
returned to the United States, according to the SLDN, a Washington-based
advocacy group for gays and lesbians in the military.

Osburn believes the stop-loss order highlights the need to change the
military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.

"Any (stop-loss) order should not be a temporary reflection of gays' and
lesbians' ability to be put in harm's way in defense of our freedoms," he
said, "but a permanent recognition of their right to serve our nation in
times of both war and peace."

On Wednesday, President George W. Bush ordered bombers and dozens of other
military aircraft to be deployed within days to bases in the Persian Gulf,
in addition to the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt. Titled "Operation
Infinite Justice," the move is a response to the Sept. 11 attacks on New
York and Washington, D.C.

Subject:      What is to be criticized
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I want to continue the debate over Ron's letter. I found the part of the
argument that takes issue with the "left" to be misguided, and hence I
question it. It seems based on an assumption that to argue strongly against
war as an initial response to the horror of September 11 is to be in denial
of the event and hence to risk isolating oneself rhetorically. This implies
that in order to participate in debate, one has to give initial assent to
military response before one can speak to the issue.

For me, the ethical imperative against 1) past American policy and 2)
present possibility of action that would make the situation even more
dangerous stems directly from a deep and committed response to the deaths
of 6000. Ron suggests the opposite--that antiwar leftists who do not
overcome their principled horror of war are in some sense in denial of its
consequences when they occur, and hence their responses will remain outside
of debate.

Here are some places in his argument where he says or infers these things,
and a response:
>It is time for progressives to act, but not on the past dragged on as habit.

Objection to American militarism from Hiroshima to the present is not a
habit but an analysis of the world situation we are in. America is widely
disliked for its position as dominant world power--or have we lost touch
with reality? On the British Poets list there has been a great deal of
mockery of the current rubric under which we are going to war: "Infinite
Justice." As one post had it, "just us, forever and ever." America is
isolated--you feel this in the responses of those outside the country--by
virtue of its position of military dominance. Jingoism blinds us to the
world we are in.
>The attack places progressives into a particularly difficult and painful
>spot. So far, my impression is that the left as a whole has not responded
>well and is mostly doing a bang-up job of isolating itself at the worst
>possible moment in history.

I do not understand not so much the reasoning as the perception here. The
"left," like everyone else in the country, is reeling from the implications
of these events. There has been a paradigm shift in terms of everyone's
estimation of what is possible. Ron sees a perverse will in responses that
are, in fact, trying to find a perspective from which to speak and act.
"Doing a bang-up job of isolating itself" is oddly insensitive to the
immediate need for information, analysis, discussion. Perhaps for Ron the
left's response is failing to protect us, rhetorically or analytically, and
this is where we need to call for a higher order of protection--the U.S.
military. It is obvious that confused and disorganized need could give the
green light to any sort of military response, however.
>The argument that a U.S.-led coalition, or even the U.S. on its own,
>should not respond militarily to the death of over 5,000 people, all but a
>hundred or so of them civilians, is based on premises that reveal an
>absolute inability to look at the circumstances directly. Instead, people
>seem to be continuing on some mode of automatic pilot that is
>well-intended, but ultimately self-defeating.

I have no argument with an initial response against war as either an
ethical principle or rhetorical stance. But Ron assumes that all "left"
responses might be characterized in such a way as to reveal "an absolute
inability to look at the circumstances directly." An anti-militarist
position, it seems to me, is an appropriate first response to the
circumstances--in our state of inadequate knowledge. It ought to require
deep reflection, not just shock and horror, to change that position.
>The present situation is qualitatively different from the Vietnam War or
>Desert Storm. To pretend otherwise and to trot out the same old slogans is
>itself potentially a disaster from which the left may not soon recover.

False. American disregard of civilian casualties, from Hiroshima to Vietnam
to Desert Storm is a direct rationale for the terrorists's refusal to
distinguish between civilians and military targets. File footage exists of
bin Laden saying precisely this. Of course it is a rationalization. But it
is one that is believed by an overwhelming majority of the Muslim world.
Selective assassinations by Israelis of Palestinian leaders and the botched
US attempt to get bin Laden in Operation Infinite Reach have only
reinforced this perception. Ditto the civilian consequences of the embargo
of Iraq.
>To focus exclusively on what the U.S. might (and may well) do wrong in
>responding to the attack is to miss the point so completely that it is
>going to be difficult, if not impossible, later on, to be taken seriously.
>That is what I think is at stake.

The notion that a principled position may not be taken seriously is akin, I
think, to Bush senior's dictum, "You can't hear them." It makes a certain
perception of loyalty a precondition for debate.
>(4)   Does anybody honestly think that if America were to somehow "improve
>its behavior" toward people of the Third World, that this would eliminate
>the impetus behind these attacks? That it could do so quickly enough to
>forestall future assaults?

It is a very reasonable position to see American actions as contributing
directly to the motives for and reception of the terrorists' actions. If
the US were to strongly renounce civilian targets (as Ron indicates later)
it would certainly would help to change world opinion, and hence the
context for any future terrorist actions. Ron's argument here is in direct
contradiction here to what he calls for later--the need for debate
concerning the limits of American responses, with which I agree.
>(5)    Does anybody honestly think that the U.S. could do # 4 without
>literally abandoning Israel?

This is very out of touch with the events in Israel since Ariel Sharon
marched into the plaza of the Muslim sanctuary in Jerusalem with his
retinue. The U.S. had, under Clinton, been restraining the Israelis from
the kinds of aggressivity we have seen since. The current situation in
Israel is a direct result of the change in policy. Therefore, it is
nonsense to say that changing the perception of the US's role in world,
which should be done, means abandoning Israel. The US should return to a
proactive role in containing the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and in
seeking a solution. The first order of business would be to seek support
for a coalition that would remove Sharon from power.
>In the face of all this, to argue against the use of force in breaking up
>the network of terrorist cells is to confess that one is not only tone
>deaf to the popular will, manipulated or otherwise (and I suspect,
>frankly, that the media, like the pols, is much more a follower than a
>leader in this), it is even wrong in terms of the protection of Americans.
>To the extent that the American left and its allies puts its eggs into
>this basket, it is going to find itself with very little credibility
>remaining with which to make the far more crucial arguments that need to
>be made right now.

It is very odd to see a former pacifist seek to limit the terms of debate
over the legitimacy of force. Even if Ron no longer agrees with his former
C.O. position, or sees the situation as historically different, he should
not seek to discredit that position in others. To argue as above seems to
me to capitulate to the media as representative of reality. It is important
to maintain an alternative perspective, and indeed Ron argues for this.
Another reason why I find his position so contradictory.
>But to take any position that can be perceived as inaction in the face of
>the enormous physical and emotional wound that confronts the American
>people serves only to exacerbate the reputation of the left as a movement
>completely out of touch with reality.

This is a little like the "prior restraint" of possibly actionable speech
as a condition for limiting speech. How can a former C.O. see
anti-militarist arguments as out of touch with reality, when they are based
on the entirety of human history?
>Julian Borger, also writing in The Guardian
>(<http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,553876,00.html>http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,553876,00.html),
>gets it right when he argues against the idea that "Americans should be
>asking themselves why this happened to them . . . . Rather than getting
>angry, then, they should be meditating and wondering what they have done wrong.

No, Americans need to figure out what it is about recent US policy that has
made it possible for us to be seen as the world's enemy and to correct that
policy.
>"This point of view seems to me to be detached to the point of inhumanity.
>Moreover, it is driven by an internal logic that is utterly bogus. That
>logic, insinuated between the lines, suggests that the horror visited on
>thousands of New Yorkers must be balanced somewhere by an equal and
>opposite evil that the US has inflicted upon someone else."

Jingoism. The author implies that horror at past US policy is an
indifference to the tragedy. Rather, the two are directly related. Grief
does not interfere with the imperative with analysis.
>Borger is correct in acknowledging that that position fails to acknowledge
>the enormity of the assault. It will certainly be rejected by a huge
>majority of people. As it should be. And that position also fails to
>address the ugly reality that, without action, future attacks are
>inevitable, and that the death toll in the towers has raised the bar for
>ambitious future martyrs.

The question of appropriate action may be raised without this attack on
principled positions of those who question whether American overreaction
will only perpetuate the horror. American overreaction is not only
possible, it is likely. Hawks in the Pentagon will try to use this
situation in order to "clean up" related situations--as in Iraq--even if
they fail in the attempt.
>Nick Piombino's post earlier on the flag's role not as an icon of
>war-mongering, but as a transitional object in the grieving process, makes
>perfect sense to me.

As I've written elsewhere, the flag is not a transitional object but a
symbol of national identity. I cannot dissociate American history from that
symbol. While I do not see the same aggression in flying the flag as was
evident in the Gulf War, I think the innocence of its use as a symbol of
human, rather than national, solidarity is a precise desire to forget that
history.
>I've been struck at how radically differently it has been used than, say,
>the yellow ribbon campaign during the Gulf War, a soft swastika if ever
>there was one. If anything, the flag's role this time around has been one
>of solidarity , an emblem not of the state but of the people. Coming out
>of the Vietnam experience, I never thought I would see the stars & stripes
>used that way. But there it is. And it's everywhere.

I am reminded of socialist/populist embrace of the nation-state both in WWI
and II. It is important to define, rather, an oppositional,
internationalist position. The US needs to see itself from the perspective
of the world, and rallying around the flag is not going to sharpen that
perception.

What follows is a petition at a website listed below that will be
forwarded
to President Bush, and other world leaders, urging them to avoid war
as a response to the terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon this week. Please read it, sign, and forward the link
to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. We must circulate

this quickly if it is to have any effect at all, as the Congress of The
United States has already passed a resolution supporting any military
action President Bush deems appropriate.  Read and if you can go to the
website and sign it...

We, the undersigned, citizens and residents of the United States of
America and of countries around the world, appeal to the President of
The United States, George W. Bush; to the NATO Secretary General, Lord
Robertson; to the President of the European Union, Romano Prodi; and
to all leaders internationally to use moderation and restraint in
responding
to the recent terrorist attacks against the United States. We implore
the
powers that be to use, wherever possible, international judicial
institutions and international human rights law to bring to justice
those responsible for the attacks, rather than the instruments of war,
violence or destruction.

Furthermore, we assert that the government of a nation must be
 presumed separate and distinct from any terrorist group that may
operate within its borders, and therefore cannot be held unduly
accountable for the latter's crimes. It follows that the government
of a particular nation should not be condemned for the recent attack
without compelling evidence of its cooperation and complicity with
those individuals who actually committed the crimes in question.

Innocent civilians living within any nation that may be found
 responsible, in part or in full, for the crimes recently perpetrated
against the United States, must not bear any responsibility for the
actions of their government, and must therefore be guaranteed
safety and immunity from any military or judicial action taken
against the state in which they reside.

Lastly and most emphatically, we demand that there be no recourse
to nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, or any weapons of
indiscriminate destruction, and feel that it is our inalienable human
right to live in a world free of such arms.

Hey Ponce, I got this email last week. Checked it out at Urbanlegends.com
(great site, I highly reccommend it). It is a hoax.

I also am sending this back to everyone's address I saw on this email. It is
very important not to react to rumors. There's a lot of great information
out there , but also a lot of inflammatory misinformation, especially right
now. PLEASE take a moment to check stuff out before you pass it along. Think
about it: You could be saving someone from injury, harassment or worse
considering the way people are feeling right now. Sorry to be up on a
soapbox. This is the only email you'll receive from me, unless you'd like to
be on my mailing list. ( I'm an LA singer songwriter for all you music
lovers) Just let me know if it's ok to add you. You won't be spammed.
Thanks- Peace AND Love Pattie Rich

BELLADONNA*  will go forward with the readings as planned.
Our publisher, David Kirshenbaum works at Wall Street so BELLADONNA*  books
will be a bit slowed down.

I feel confident that the readers in this series will be natural
contributors to the dialogue on peace, justice and mourning.

Hi all,

Activists in NYC have set up a phone-in calendar of peace events in the City
at 212-726-3272. There are things happening every day in NYC and I encourage
people to go to as much as possible and to document whatever you can and
send reports/photos etc. to the independent media center or WBAI In Exile
(WBIX.org,) and other responsive media organizations.

Also, I do think that it's very helpful to be as "out" as possible as
pro-peace by wearing buttons/shirts etc. or putting up signs. We need
alternatives to the flag and to the ubiquitous revenge images -- I saw "dead
or alive" t-shirts the day after that stupid speech...

Thanks to all, Caroline

The quality of mercy is not strained,
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath.  It is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
Tis mightiest in the mightiest.  It becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown.
His scepter shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty
Wherein doth sit the dread of kings.
But mercy is above the sceptered sway,
It is an attribute to God himself,
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice.  Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
That in the course of justice none of us
Should see salvation.  We do pray for mercy
And that same prayer doth teach us to render
The deeds of mercy.

I agree this list has certainly risen to the occasion of  what I would want
to call a genuine sharing of community information and personal response. I
have read comments on a piece Silliman wrote but was not recieving messages
for twelve days or so so haven't read it yet. But your piece on flag
waving,Arielle, strikes a similar note in myself and I want to thank you for
writing it. I too put a flag in my mailbox when my neighbor put one up next
door.  It seemed important that Kim, my neighbor, who is fifty, dying from
cancer, with only weeks to live would go ahead and raise his flag.  Kim was
president of the Longmont United Way he has spent his life working to aid
others in trouble. Ezra, Kim& Karens fourth grade son, wanted to know why
anyone would bomb us. Kim explained to him that we have done some despicable
things to people in the middle east and they have been hurt by us and our
greed for oil (remember he is talking to a nine year old) and so they could
have struck out at us. Ezra was shaken by the news of bombs but he is also a
kid who knows he has to say goodbye to his father probably before they get
to cut up the huge pumpkins Ezra & his mom grew in the backyard. So, when
Kim decided to put up his flag it really did seem to me when walking through
town and offered a flag by the local flooring company that, yes, I was glad
to have neighbors, that I was alive and trying to figure out how to teach
Thoreau's Civil Disobedience essay that Tuesday morning and Andrew
Sullivan's "The He Hormone" to kids who drive pickup trucks with gun racks
and listen to that godawful counrty but were as confused and scared about
war as the rest of us, and that sense of gratitude seemed like enough at the
time to stick a flag in my mailbox.

The reclusive Mr. Humphries lives and works in a large, dusty, Eastern
metropolis and the author of Optima Suavidad, Greenbean Press, NYC, ISBN
1-891408-08-9.  We (realpoetik@scn.org) will be happy to pass comments
along.  "Sal", he said, when I spoke to him, "tell these bloody poseurs to
buy my book."



Well,
that was interesting, although
I'm not under oath.
Famous Last Words:
"Hey!  Why do you want me in front?"
"Darling,"
I would say,
"You look like the kind of person who
wouldn't press charges."
Whereas now, spacemen go about gathering
words like "melancholy"
and put them in sacks.
And then they find you dead in
the bathroom.

If organized crime is wrong
I don't want to be right.
We used to play games together.
"Let's role play," she'd say.
"OK," I'd say, "Who do you
want me to be?"
"Anyone but you," she said.
This was before that trouble over
some stickups the folks in
the witness protection program thought
I did but I didn't.
Then I went to Penn State for three years,
wait, no, it
was State Pen.
So here we are, all awash and
our naughty parts engorged and tingly.
I wear a little bracelet that asks me,
"What would Noam Chomsky do?"

Dear Charles,

First of all, thank you so much for your postings at the poetics list -
they, together with all the discussion going on there, have done a great
job in making "all this", well, both heavier and lighter, to me.

Somehow, it hasn't been that simple to assume the "brave" stance of the
New Yorkers reported from hour to hour on TV.=20

I've really been very down, mentally, this whole week. Feeling deprived
of the meaning (or the meaning of meaning) in just about everything.
Growing more and more addicted to the CNN... Not depressed, but utterly
confused, disappointed to so many things, species, ideas, movements,
perspectives, persons - myself (and yes, certain amount of what's been
going on the list, also) included.=20

Terrified, I almost forgot to say. Horrified to the point of wanting to
vomit.

Sad. And angry. And angry at having to think it over and over again,
inside my own head, as I'm going to do here...

Actually it's kind of strange, that I, who, as you know, do not consider
myself that much of a leftist nowadays, should have come think of the
"all this" so predominantly from a leftist perspective.=20

This is one of the things that have been haunting me: among so much and
so seemingly spontaneous talk about the "responsibility" of  "us" -
"the West", "the America" - to "this", i.e. about certain
"justification" for what those 19 well-shaven men did,  I'm still to
hear the question on the *lefts own* responsibility, in that case.=20

I mean: if there's a - smallest - justification... what in that case
about the responsibility of all (us) who have, in different contexts,
been preaching about the necessity to "strike" the "system", to "blow it
up", to "hit the enemy" at its weakest, i.e. most vulnerable, i.e.
sometimes seemingly strongest point ...=20

The attacks have bin Ladens "signature", they say. Well, they also have
the signature of all urgings to strike, to throw out, to hit, to reveal
... They are all about that rhetoric finally gone abominably awry. What
have *we* done to prevent that happening? What will we do to prevent it
happening again?

As I wrote in one of my earliest notes to "this":=20

I think I have seen the eyes that have seen the eyes of Osama bin Laden.
My hand=20
was helping=20
to lift the hand that=20
rose to point to the=20
target.=20

Well, maybe that connects to one of the oldest problems of the left:
maybe there never really were that many actual leftists at all - just
followers after followers believing others being the real leftists...

I've become to think pretty much along the lines suggested by Tamir
Ansary (quoted in the post by Alan Sondheim, September 15...), and I
almost  fully agree with Ron Silliman in his excellent analysis of the
"lefts" dilemmas today.

To me, it's spurious to compare, and weigh against each others, the
attacks on the Towers, and, say, the Clinton bombings in Sudan, when
clearly both, ultimately, result from the same plan. It's sad, and
embarrassing, to see a mind like Noam Chomsky's to fall into that
trap...

Yes, the Nazis keep coming to mind. Yet I believe the enemy, or time, or
the stakes, are worse than that this time around. Much worse.=20

That's one of the saddening things: that it's so open, to everyone, to
see what is at stake - the whole of the civilization, the modernization,
the idea of (any kind of) progress, human dignity and rights, literacy,
freedom to speech, to gender, to be even... and yet, truly, it doesn't
seem to hit home.=20

So, is there, behind all the talk about the culpability of the
Americans, of the "we" or the "they" getting what they've been asking
for, a more deep-going indifference towards the civilization as such?

Which, then, may not deserve to be defended that strongly?

No, of course I don't think that way. As an old leftist, I keep thinking
about the Front Populaire against Nazism - how long it took to build up
(they tell). The enormous amount of prejudices (and hair-splitting about
the "real" or "ultimate" "responsibility" of "ruling classes", on the
left, and the "reality" of the danger, on both sides) to be left behind
before the democrats, right and left, in France,then in the whole
Europe, later on the world scale in the WW2 could join forces - to what
still is the most spectacular, if not only, permanent result of all the
left's struggles - the victory over Nazism.=20

"Do you think this is going to lead to the World War Three", Kirsi asked
me during the first hours.  "No", I reassured her, "this *is* it." I
still think that way. I'm afraid I sound a little less reassured day by
day...=20

Yes: I do think it's a war. True, every time Bush (the-son-of-a-Bush)
walks to the screen, I feel embarrassed about his "Dad, look, I've got
my own war here now" vein of putting things. Still: he is the elected
leader of the leading nation of the civilized world that's under an
extremely dangerous attack. There's no way around it, nor need there be.
He is my commander-in-chief in this. Period.

Besides, much of what many representatives of "the Bush administration"
are saying makes perfect sense to me. The idea of a "new kind of war" in
many ways  echoes what we are used to hear from the "progressive"
security policy experts: how the real threats have ceased to be nation
states, armies, bombs - being poisons, environment, weather, and
terrorism instead. =20

Yes, I too am concerned about the perspective of premature efforts at
seizing "the prime suspect", not to speak about bombing Afghanistan. But
not because we supposedly lack evidence on the man (his interviews alone
would suffice...).=20

On the contrary: because that might compromise the longer perspective,
shroud from view the necessity to wage a *really* long term ... hmmm ...
battle.

Which will involve new ways of attack, but new modes of defence also.

This is the most important, and to my view, the most neglected point
here. That we are under an absolute necessity to defence ourselves, and
that we can do that by (cannot do that without) *changing our society*,
our civilization, our way of life - which haven't necessarily be to the
worse.

That among this tremendous sadness, there are glints of an enormous hope
- of people getting together, starting to do something together, to some
of the most important issues determining the future of the planet, of
all us.

That, for these reasons also, the left needs be involved in the defence,
not critizising it from outside.

Yes, I believe it's time to dig the good old Gandhi out from beneath the
rubble of cold and other wars - and start thinking how the doctrine of
passive resistance might be applied in this new war.=20

To prevent the next strike, which I too fear may well involve biological
and/or nuclear components.=20

To take new, decisive steps towards further disarmament, nuclear and
otherwise.

Now, when the need for these kinds of measures, for once, is so evident
to everybody.

But nothing on these lines can be done, if we refuse to accept the
common cause - the need to preserve the humanity, the civilization.

In the final analysis (as we used to say), the problem is not about
seeing and acknowledging the enemy (although this is important too) -
it's about our willingness to come together...=20

There  will be societal changes, whether we want them or not. Not all of
them will have any bearing on democracy and freedom - like tightening
the security on airplanes (ok), fewer flights (well, so nice you were
here already... and we *do* plan to come over during the Autumn...).
Others will be more problematic...=20

What I'm specifically interested in is the now almost inevitable
perspective of "more documented life" (Bill Gates (!)) - fraught with
dangers, of course, but also containing seeds to something new,
including the idea of everybody as publisher - which of course is
already manifested, in a rudimental form, in the present day Internet...

Which may well be one of the main lines of defence...

...After all... it was build to fight terrorism... by the US military...

None of these and other things can be done overnight, and none without
the ingenuity, the innovativeness...

...of the people?

...of America?=20

...of the left?

...of the poetry? =20

Well, in my first notes, again, I also wrote about "nothing, the least
the poetry, being the same / any more".

(I also wrote: "Ich bin (sic) ein Amerikaner jetzt...")

And, in a mock-brechtian note: "What a time! When / talk about the
meaning of meaning is almost crime, in the face / of this meaningless /
crime so  / full of meaning..."

As you know, I had made the decision not to write in Finnish any more,
and was wondering whether I could start learning to write in English
instead.

Now, there seemed to be a double impossibility to write (and I was also
frustrated by the futility of the question as such: what difference
would it make in which language I decide to fall silent (this one also
coming from Brecht...)=20

To be honest, this was one of the reasons to be angry to "the
perpetrators": what right did they have to come and muddle the quiet
waters of my self-complacent post-leftist life of mulling about the
value of language and poetry ...=20

Of having interesting conversations on the meaning of meaning.

The word *interesting* seeming to be impossible to use any more.

Then I remembered how I spent the night before the strike  -  i.e.
translating some of my dadaistic sonnets into English.=20

Here's one draft, translated, in ways, back, not to, but towards,  the
73rd sonnet of Shakespeare, from which the Finnish "original" ("Joko Ono
Mato") was a pseudo-homophonic version:

John Winston Worm=20

that time. Of year. No roots. No rats
o yellow leaves, o run, or few do hang
upon these boughs... So what? Against the odds=20
"bare-ruined-choirs". Muchos Grazias. The bats=20

in me this mean, this twilight, nights=20
as after sunset. Poising in west=20
by and by black night. Japanese tights
death's second shell. Salsa in the rest=20

my fatal past-time, glowing of such halo
on the ashes as of this youth: then die=20
then death-bed, the here in Borsalino=20

consumed by taxi. Amen. Hand nourished by
what thou perceivest, so make thy love more strong
to love that well, which thou must leave ere long

To me, at least, incredibly in ways, this humble draft speaks rather
straightforwardly about what has happened, since.=20

As it should.

As all poetry ("even my poetry") should?=20

And what about this other draft, where the remote origins are a stanza
in Pushkin's Yevgeni Onegin (the one with the shot) and the Helsinki
tabloid's on the Versaci murder in summer 1997:

Paparazzi. Now (Onegin One)

Pressing at chest the new hand now
he wonders: who. Ash in his expression
gets unseen - masks to borrow,
for each to allow own, to give the cushion.

A number of steeps he downwards stoops
routinely frothing - frolicking,
with many a wealthy client shivering.
Turnkeys get turned. We see the licking.  =20

Escaping arrived here three days past:
now is no more! To a miamibeachian=20
cast of eternity has over-gone,

and oops! full blossom of the vibes now knows
the one, who at stages used to shine,=20
to cross, to over-trot, to bet, behave.=20

This could be offered as a contorted mirror of, and for, what happened -
including all this rummaging about the responsibility, the who did what,
the implications, ways to act against, the dangers of getting divided,
ways to come together...

Maybe the poetry, for one, need *not* change, after all. Maybe *that's*
the way for poetry to change, now as always.=20

Maybe that's the way it already *did* change.=20

As it should?

In any case, I'm sure that poetry, understood as working with mysteries,
uncertainties, and, yes, that which does not have a meaning, voice,
words, yet, is crucially important at these kind of times when people
need to think "all over again".

Of course, it's only poetry. Poetry never was the whole life. But in a
way it is all about resistance - and very often passive at that...

Well, and at least writing this has been an enormous relief to me.

I wrote it to you. I couldn't bring myself to write to the list - it
didn't seem appropriate, in a way, yet. I wanted address someone I
know... but of course you are free to circulate this, in any ways you
might find advisable.

And it would be interesting to hear what you think about some of the
things I said.

Hey, there's the word - *interesting*.=20

I'm moving on.

We are going to make it.

We are going to survive.

Love,

Leevi

George, I usually agree with you, but I think your response here is cruel.
I do think there are a good number of people who have been terribly shaken,
and wonder what of "america" there is to hold on to, and they want
something. So, the flag. Is this a great thing to do? In my estimation,
probably not, but is its meaning the same as jingoistic jumping on the
bandwagon of war? -- absolutely not. Is it understandable? I think so. Am I
going to do it? No, I am definitely not comfortable with that. But the kind
of ridicule you imply here, I believe, is going way too far. I hope there's
some goodhearted humor there that I'm just not catching.

The enormity of the terrorist strike / absolutely devastating. Still I
remain a critic of mediated events. Sure the strike and the collapse
were all too real, but the patriotic response is a highly orchestrated
matter of position with respect to public opinion: get the bastards, but
be tolerant of ordinary muslims. Involving a number of corrections and
adjustments as the rhetoric of national resolve evolves.

The impact on the lives of people in NYC, on certain industries, on
agitated individuals, bigots and left liberals are also real
events--each needs to be gauged separately, of course. Impact is always
real. Thoreau argued that an unjust act required dissent/disobedience if
it implicated 'you' to act against your sense of justice/conscience.
Ever since the west first empowered individuals in the ways that it has
done, there has been no demand for individual responsibility as
trenchant as this that he authored, none as powerful in terms of its
effect. No I am not looking for a hero here. I am simply referring to a
reality that has proven effective historically. It seems all too evident
to me that any act of violence that harmed a civilian population,
muslim, possibly enslaved (as in Afghanistan), is an act of violence
from which I must dissent. Of course, Ron seems to be targeting real
world possibilities of meaningful and consequential dissent. Still (I'll
be Deleuzian now) our very humanity lies in our becoming
minoritarian--those of us who can see our way to it. And it does remain
an individual matter of conscious and even terrible aloneness.
Realistically there has never been a possibility, even through the voice
of reason, of converting a majority to a minority point of view. The
history books sometimes tell the story differently years later. No one
on this list is the first person to question the double-bind of
majoritarian democracy (the Enlightenment bargain etc.). Still without
being heroic or smarmy about it, the dissenter must dissent and display
leadership by dissenting when circumstances require it. Dissent can be
cool, dissent can be infectious, and critics of the Free-speech movement
are eager to point this out. Still dissent is also real and difficult
and costly to those who feel it necessary.

I'm fairly sure that Nick suggested the flag is a "transitional" object.  It
is atemporary symbol that facilitates passage to [a better stae?].  Most
'good' art is like this, as Iser, among others have said.   As such, the
flag is in development.

I think at this point in time any attempts to dictate it's shape and color
based on old (pre-September 11, 2001) doctrine are misguided unless they
encompass the entirty of its history.

Muhammed Ali was on TV tonight as a Muslim and American in front of a flag.
He mentioned he had been a boxer but did not endorse boxing by anyone.  I'm
not sure what he would say about actually going to war or dropping the
hammer but I am pretty sure he would say that  CO is an indivdual choice.
Even though I would have paidattention to Chomsky on September 10, right now
I'd be more likely to heed Muhammed Ali at the moment.

and I, too, am being a little harsh, George, as some reservation about
flagwaving is not a bad idea at all, and you notice in my last message I
put "america" in quotation marks, partly because of course you and others
are right that the usa is only a part of the americas, yet we often take
the name as ours and no one else's, as if the continents were named after
us, and not the other way around, or all of us named after that italian guy
who got his moniker on the map.

Now that we are entering into war conditions, I imagine there will be a lot
of uncertainty about what is and is not occurring.

For instance, I have not seen any reportage of peace demonstrations in
major media, though Elizabeth Treadwell mentions them occurring at
Berkeley. Apparently 2000 students rallied but "you can't hear them."

At Berkeley, where demonstrations in 1964 gave birth to the Free Speech
               movement and started a long campus protest tradition of
campus protest,
               more than 2,000 students, faculty members and community
members rallied
               for peace at Sproul Plaza, the site of the Free Speech
demonstration.

               Many carried placards asking President Bush to "Give Peace a
Chance" or
               "Stop the War." The potential for military action has
galvanized the campus,
               with students signing petitions against a war and pledging
support for
               Arab-American and Muslim students.

               "The media has stirred the country into a froth of hatred
and revenge," said
               Kayla Monroe, 21, a part-time general studies student who
carried a "Bush:
               Think Before You Act" poster. "All this so-called support
for military action
               has been completely manufactured. I don't know anyone who
thinks it would
               be a good idea."

surely, the flag is not a black or white issue everywhere asit is here in
the heart of redneck country it's red, white, and blue and in the process of
evolving.  Just because I join my neighbor who is a fireman and the owner of
a nearby QuickSak in displaying a flag  surely doesn't make me responsible
for all that has been done or will be done in its name?  We are participants
in this future.

I am kind of disappointed at the apparent lack of sophisticated
understanding of 'tranitional object' on this list as it is a term that has
a lot of relevance to art and poetry.  I'm hoping that Nick will be able to
clarify this some but from my understanding it actually is close to what
Barrett pulls out of Freud.

but for what it's worth I feel that the statements, "Johnny, get your gun"
"get your flag" "get your poem" are somewhat equivalent statements an
adolesent might reply to.  What is made out of or with those objects
determines both their success and whther or not one grows out of that stage.
The suicide hijackers obviously did not, gun-wavers areunlikely to grow, but
it is hope that flag-wavers will become flag-bearers and bear a flag that is
not entrenched in black and white thinking.

I think there's one thing that is still wholly misunderstood on this
List and maybe I see it because I'm older (if not wiser) than most of
you.  The reason there has to be action (we can debate what kind of
action) is 99% self-defense, pure and simple.  We can sit and debate the
similarities between our crimes and their crimes till we're blue in the
face, but unless we do something THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ATTACK.  Maybe
not a plane, maybe this time germ warfare or the water supply or a
bridge--whatever.  So far most of the action has been finding the
terrorists--which I applaud since I believe this should be an
intelligence war not a bombing one.  But without concerted action by
ourselves and our allies, you won't have to worry about the U.S. being a
nasty Imperialist super power any more.  Because it may not be here at
all.

Fortunately, about 92% of the country, acc. to polls, seems to
understand this.

Bush's Wars

By Alexander Cockburn
and Jeffrey St Clair

It would not have been hard to improve on President George Bush's normal

listless speaking style and, faced with the great challenge of his
speech to the joint session of Congress on Thursday night, the President

managed the task capably enough. Reduced to its essentials, the speech
was a declaration of lawlessness, with the concept of "justice" being
reduced to that of the freedom to shoot the other guy on whatever terms
America may find convenient. How else are to interpret the much quoted
line that "whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to
our enemies, justice will be done." This is the language of terrorism.

"Every nation in every region now has a decision to make," Bush
declared. "Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists." Thus
has the founding charter of the United Nations been finally discarded,
even as a fig leaf, and the founding charter of NATO been reduced to a
line from a western.

In terms of substance Bush has committed America and its allies to the
overthrow of the Afghan Taleban, with occupation of Afghanistan
apparently part of the schedule. Here at CounterPunch we have no
affection for the Taleban, any more than we have nothing but revulsion
for the dreadful terrorist acts of September 11. But Bush and advisers
seem to be embarking on a course of folly that will not strike down, may

even bolster the Taleban, and that could indeed lead to a coup in
Pakistan, installing in power army officers deeply complicit with the
Taleban and also in possession of nuclear weapons.

Bush pronounces the forthcoming war as one between freedom and fear,
with God most definitely on America's side. We are now witnessing the
opening volleys of an assault on constitutional freedoms in this country

by a government in which opposition has been effectively been suspended.

More than once, on Thursday night, we heard gleeful use of the ominous
phrase, "there is no opposition". As Bush talked about unified national
purpose, the news cameras lingered on Rep Barbara Lee of Berkley,
everlastingly to her credit the only member of Congress to vote against
authorization of open-ended retaliation. Aside from Lee, there were few
independent voices in Congress. Among them was the Texas libertarian
Republican, Ron Paul who told his colleagues, "Demanding domestic
security in times of war invites carelessness in preserving civil
liberties and the right of privacy. Frequently the people are only too
anxious for their freedoms to be sacrificed on the altar of
authoritarianism thought to be necessary to remain safe and secure."

We now have the prospect of a new cabinet officer, supervising the new
minted Office of Homeland Security (OHS), to be headed by the governor
of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, a man known to death penalty opponents as
the official who has been leading the lynch mob again st Mumia abu Jamal

and to anti-globalization protesters as the man who supervised the
violent suppression of civil rights at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia last July.

Want a foretaste of the kind of actions Ridge is likely to feel will
enhance homeland security? Last July Philadelphia saw coordinated law
enforcement involving FBI, local and state police, with covert
surveillance, infiltration and disruption of legitimate groups, snooping

on email, phonetaps. Protest leaders were arrested early on, under
absurd pretexts and in the case of John Sellers (Ruckus Society) and
Kate Sorensen (Act Up) held on million-dollar bail. Jailed protesters
were brutally handled, denied access to medical care and attorneys. When

all was over, the courts threw out 95 per cent of the charges brought
against protesters by the Philadelphia police. Ridge presided over an
utterly disgraceful and violent denial of freedoms of assembly, free
speech and due process. The only comfort we can is that the FBI, CIA,
FEMA, Pentagon and Coast Guard will see the Office of Homeland Security
as a bureaucratic threat and move swiftly to neutralize it. We have no
doubt that these seasoned bureaucratic fighters will soon be leaking
information discreditable to Ridge.

Of greater concern is Attorney General John Ashcroft's agenda, now being

rushed to Congress. There are three components to what has been
described as "the mother of all anti-terrorism bills". Immigration;
wiretapping and domestic intelligence surveillance; search and seizure.
The bill sought by Ashcroft vests virtually unlimited authority in the
US Attorney General to target non-citizens with arrest, indefinite
incarceration and deportation. The arrests can be made on the basis of
secret evidence with little or no opportunity for meaningful judicial
review. As the ACLU points out, the upgraded sanctions could mean that
if a legal immigrant had in the 1980s contributed to Mandela's African
National Congress, which could be grounds for deportation today.

There's an irony here. As the writer John Mecklin has recently pointed
out in the San Francisco Weekly, among the first investors in Arbusto
Energy, George W. Bush's early adventure in the oil business, was James
Bath, a Texas airplane broker. According to Mecklin, Bass invested
$50,000 in Arbusto (the word for bush in Spanish), said sum coming from
Saudi investors including the bin Laden family. If true, this means that

theoretically Bush could be subject to sanction as benefiting indirectly

from terror.

Ashcroft is seeking expanded wiretapping power, plus enhanced ability to

snoop on e-sites. The bill seeks roving wiretap ability, meaning that
the police could tap any phone used by their target, no matter to whom
that phone might belong. In Ashcroft's line of fire is the "probable
cause" standard, governing warrants to snoop. Ashcroft's bill also seeks

to vastly widen law enforcement's ability to conduct secret searches. As

the ACLU emphasizes, "this bill would extend the authority of the
government to request 'secret searches' in every criminal offense." As
usual, emergency is used as the pretext for a far wider assault on basic

constitutional rights.

The president's speech came at the end of a week of ferocious war
mongering. The predictable eye-for-an-eye frenzy built up its usual
lethal head of steam with predictable rapidity. The outstanding question

is: how many eyes for an eye. Count 6,500 dead in the Trade Towers, the
four hijacked planes and the Pentagon. How many dead does this require
in Kabul, or Baghdad or elsewhere in the hinterlands of terrorist Islam?

The only quick way to achieve killing on this scale would be with a
substantial nuclear device on a city. Given this requirement, we may
applaud the restraint of Thomas Woodrow in the Washington Times on
September 14, though his moderation is salted with the pusillanimous
phrase "at a bare minimum". Woodrow recommends that "at a bare minimum,
tactical nuclear capabilities should be used against the bin Laden camps

in the desert of Afghanistan. To do less would be rightly seen by the
poisoned minds that orchestrated these attacks as cowardice on the part
of the United States and the current administration."

Absent dropping a Big One, how can the necessary revenge be exacted?
Cruise missiles, used by Bill Clinton as a way of expressing his
displeasure at Sudan, may be useful for destroying pharmaceutical
factories, hospitals, even defense ministries, but the body counts are
not robust.
But who or what is there to bomb in Afghanistan? The Russians have
already done their best. A pathetically poor country in the first place,

Afghanistan is only marginally ahead of Mali, in terms of available
infrastructure to destroy, with far more challenging terrain.

A land invasion in force, a blitzkrieg sparing nothing and no one?
Afghanistan is famously the graveyard of punitive missions embarked upon

by the Great Powers, as the British discovered in the nineteenth century

and the Soviets in the 1980s. The mere mounting an expeditionary force
would take would be a difficult, possibly protracted business, landing
the United States in a prodigious number of diplomatic difficulties,
given the mutual antagonisms and stresses of adjacent or nearby states
such as Pakistan, India, Russia's dependency Tadzikistan, China.

One familiar way extricating oneself from confrontation an unsuitable
foe is to substitute a more satisfactory one. Though it is highly likely

that Iran was the sponsor of the downing of Panam Flight 103, in revenge

for the downing of the Iranian Airbus by the US carrier Vincennes (whose

crew was subsequently decorated for its conduct in shooting down a
planeload of civilians) the US preferred to identify Qaddafi's Libya as
the culprit, as a more easily negotiable target for revenge. Already
there's a lobby, the most conspicuous of whom is former CIA chief James
Woolsey, pressing Iraq's case as possible sponsor or co-sponsor of the
World Trade Center attacks. So sanctions against Iraq could be
strengthened, its cities bombed and perhaps even another invasion at
tempted.

Obviously aware of the difficulties of surrounding speedy, adequately
bloody retribution, Bush's entourage have been talking in Mao-like terms

about "protracted war", or a "war in the shadows". The purely nominal
ban against US Government-sponsored assassination (there have been
numerous CIA-backed against Castro since the mid-1970s ban, if you
believer the Cubans) will be lifted, as will the supposed inhibition
against the CIA hiring unsavory characters, meaning drug smugglers, many

of them also trained in the flying schools of southern Florida.

The war in the shadows will be definition be shadowy (hence poor
provender for the appetite for revenge), at least until some CIA-backed
revenge bombing surfaces into public view like the attempted bombing of
Sheikh Fadlallah outside a Beirut mosque, sponsored by CIA chief William

Casey, which missed the Sheikh but which killed nearly a hundred
bystanders, including many children.

On the morning of September 11 Judge Henry Wood was trying, of all
things, an American airline crash damage case in Federal District court
in Little Rock, Arkansas. In the wake of the attacks there were orders
to close the courthouse. All obeyed, except Judge Wood, aged 83, who
insisted that jury and lawyers and attendants remain in place. Turning
down a plea for mistrial by the defendant, Wood said, "This looks like
an intelligent jury to me and I didn't want the judicial system
interrupted by a terrorist act, no matter how horrible."

Wood's was the proper reaction. America could do with more of what used
to be called the Roman virtues. A monstrous thing happened in New York,
but should this be a cause for a change in national consciousness? Is
America so frail? People talk of the trauma of another Pearl Harbor, but

truth to say, the trauma in the aftermath of the Day of Infamy in 1941
was far in excess of what the circumstances warranted, and assiduously
fanned by the government for reasons of state. Ask the Japanese
Americans who were interned.

Why, for that matter, ground all air traffic and semi-paralyze the
economy, with further interminable and useless inconveniences promised
travelers in the months and possibly years to come? Could any terrorist
have hoped not only to bring down the Trade Center towers but also
destroy the airline industry? It would have been far better to ask
passengers to form popular defense committees on every plane, bring
their own food and drink, keep alert for trouble and look after
themselves. A properly vigilant democracy of the air. Remember, even if
there were no x-ray machines, no searches, no passenger checks, it would

still be far more dangerous to drive to the airport than to get on a
plane.

Martyrdom is hard to beat. In the first few centuries after Christ the
Romans tried it against the Christians, whose martyrdoms were almost
entirely sacrificial of themselves, not of others. The lust for heaven
of a Muslim intent on suicidal martyrdom was surely never so eloquent as

that of St Ignatius in the second century who, under sentence of death,
doomed to the Roman amphitheater and a hungry lion, wrote in his Epistle

to the Romans, "I bid all men know that of my own free will I die for
God, unless ye should hinder me. . . Let me be given to the wild beasts,

for through them I can attain unto God. I am God's wheat, and I am
ground by the wild beasts that I may be found the pure bread of Christ.
Entice the wild beasts that they may become my sepulchre. . . Come fire
and cross and grapplings with wild beasts, wrenching of bones, hacking
of limbs, crushings of my whole body; only be it mine to attain unto
Jesus Christ."

Eventually haughty imperial Rome made its accommodation with Christians,

just as Christians amid the furies and martyrdoms and proscriptions of
the Reformation, made accommodations with each other. What sort of
accommodation should America make right now? How about one with the
history of the past hundred years, in an effort to improve the moral
world climate of the next hundred years? We use the word accommodation
in the sense of an effort to get to grips with history, as inflicted by
the powerful upon the weak. We have been miserably failed by our
national media here, as Jude Wanniski, political economist and agitator
of conventional thinking, remarked in the course of a well-merited
attack on "bipartisanship", which almost always means obdurate
determination to pursue a course of collective folly without debate: "It

is because of this bipartisanship that our press corps has become blind
to the evil acts we commit as a nation."

America has great enemies circling the campfires and threatening the
public good. They were rampant the day before the September 11 attacks,
with the prospect of deflation, sated world markets, idled capacity,
shrinking social services. Is ranting about Kabul and throwing money at
the Pentagon going to solve those national emergencies?

There is no compelling reason to accept that bin Laden is the Master
Terror Mind of the World. On some fairly persuasive accounts, his
resources have dwindled, both in terms of money and equipment. He lives
in a cave without phone or fax or email, hungrily devouring long
outdated editions of newspapers brought by visitors. He may an
inspirational force to the terrorist cadres, but we strongly doubt that
he is the hands-on master of terror portrayed by the Administration,
manipulating world financial markets.

A great nation does not respond to a single hour of terrible mayhem in
two cities by hog-tying itself with new repressive laws and abuses of
constitutional freedoms, like Gulliver doing the work of the
Lilliputians and lashing himself to the ground with a thousand cords. CP

doctor, i am impure. i cannot fight. i cannot find my enemy. i look inside
myself and nothing is there. there are stains there, blemishes. my skin is
scarred, mottled. impure, i cannot believe. everything in the world is
lost to me. i don't know the gift of names.

i don't know the gift of names because to name is to foreclose. love, you
are my friend; hate, you are my enemy. i am impure and i do not know when
one becomes the other. i shall hide out in the caves. i shall be killed
in them.

i came to you to discover, if not purity, then belief. i want to know the
books and theories, the explanations. i want to deconstruct impurity. i
want to know impurity as a symptom, not an essence. i cannot abide
essence. i want to know the shelving and layering of all things. of which
impurity is not one or the other, like an imaginary number, fabricated,
weak in its ontology.

every other is not an other, has an imaginary. this is a real problem for
me, the "me" itself is cancerous, perhaps carcinogenic. divisions force
impurity; i am symptom of the world's collapse. perhaps that is how you
can help me, to transform the word into a symptom or collocation, an
accumulation of mutilated signs.

nothing you do, doctor, bothers me; you are the filter through which i see
myself. yesterday there were flags everywhere; i did not fly one or carry
one. i cannot understand the cloth. it soaks up signs and disturbances,
collapses fields and membranes to nodes, freezes out plasma in the name of
the crystal. it is as if i have read that somewhere, "the crystal." it is
not enough i can read, parse the text, pass "crystal" into insufficiency.

you are trying, doctor, to pin this down. patriotism, ideology, religion,
bring it out in me, the pinning, from which, on the other side of the
flesh, there is only emission, spewing, abjection. the hole or cave - i'll
hide there, impure. or rather the hard external world perhaps, with its
clean and proper body, its white room, its facticity and language gaming -
perhaps you might find the tiniest spot there, the spread of cancer. in
the cave it's all fucking; if we die, we'll die with our cunts open, cocks
erect, the only use of triggering, catalyst, protein holding together
until the last violent explosion and collapse.

when the last collapse comes, the impure becomes pure; the pure becomes
impure. we welcome that; without guns, we fuck the language, fuck our
bright ideas. the only idea left in the world is already dissolving, the
idea of cancer, the tumor of northsoutheastwest, the tumor of
firstsecondthirdworld, the tumor of animalplant, of becomingwomanman.

if the last collapse comes, there will be unbearable pain, spreading
across sheets of flesh, tissue, torn tissue, rendered flesh, articulated
animations, pixels crawling across the screen.

if i wanted to save myself i would, yes, have consulted a medical doctor;
it's the psychiatrist i want, to place me in the light of the patriot,
save me from impurity, from a life suffocated in impurity. i can't forget
that death alone has a finality while life is nothing more than
meandering, useless crawling, skittering, nothing at all.

when life is nothing more than that, aphanisis sets in, everything goes
away, i'm no longer there, nothing is responsible for action. wouldn't you
prefer that doctor, wouldn't you like to see my cunt, my cock, my disease,
my lovely lure?

what would happen would be in your hands, your cunt, your cock, you'd take
me in your arms, you'd swallow my sores, my blemished skin, you'd make me
a patriot, o love flag of white and red and blue.

are you afraid of the truth, doctor, of your categories, are you afraid of
your anatomy?

i am only afraid of this, the tiniest little mark on my lovely flesh,
whole nations fall on this mark.

i am terrified of nations collapsing, life dissolving - only as they keep
me alive, dying in this place, dying indefinitely, look, another mark, i
shall give them names.

i was first frightened by nations, look, a third just there, you can see
them spreading, when they became part of me, when i could no longer
imagine events, when i collapsed into the page, there's a fourth and a

yes, they are growing across me, through me, spewing in and out of my
cock, my cunt, they are tearing my body into pieces, blinding me, my eyes
are gouged, tongue torn out, they have left my fingers alone.

i am not afraid of sex, my fingers crawl across my body, they find my
cock, my cunt, they penetrate and distend me, they turn me inside out, my
fingers are broken, they are joining multitudes, there are so many of
them.

there are too many of them, they are fucking me everywhere.

history is dead, i am impure, i shall rise up, i shall rise up

i shall rise up with nations, i shall seethe with nations, i shall wear

sometimes in times like theseit is far easier to talk about than =
experience what happened as I for one have shown in the number of =
ripostes to the list.  It's also easier to act in whatever fashion =
arises initially and in this I've been impressed to date with the =
restraint shown in this country to date individually and collectively.

In addition it is a mind-numbing time and for me that gererally takes =
the form of no talk and no writing and searching for solace in poems I =
find around, in searching in my past for relevant memories and searching =
for connection with relatives and friends.  So it is only now with the =
help of messages here and on other lits and oems posted in various =
places that I'm able to go out and see the cardinals (he blue-jays here =
seem to be secumbing to the West Nile Virus) again and start writing.

If this were a pencil it would be moving slowly as my mind has been =
slowed even if not stopped but I do feel that ifI start it will grow

The United States is the leading nation of the civilised world?  What the
country that dropped bombs disguised as toys into Vietnam? That overthrew
the democratically  elected (if any country is so elected) Allende Govt then
suported the fascist Pinochet? That bullies its way around the Middle East
and uses Israel for that purpose? That attacks Yugoslavia?  That still
"beats up on " blacks: that's poepled by millions of unemployed and
homeless? That was the first to drop the atomic bomb? That bombed hospitals
(clearly marked) in Korea? That has a crack pot in its own country who blew
up a big building in the centre of that country? That rings the world with
coventional and military arsenal of all kinds ready to strike if anyone
disagrees? That demands that every one be "for" them or "against them"?
Bullshit. I was more impressed by Bin Laden than Bush. For all we know he
was saying: while we are at war, then every American is a potential target:
or he could have been saying "come in and have a cup of tea?" The whole
footage of him could well be fabricated... The country that "bars" Hispanics
so when they do make thru the duck shooters they are cheap labour for the
big US companies?  The country that wiped out the American Indians...?

Subject: RE: It's 8:23 in New York


Dear Charles,

First of all, thank you so much for your postings at the poetics list -
they, together with all the discussion going on there, have done a great
job in making "all this", well, both heavier and lighter, to me.

Somehow, it hasn't been that simple to assume the "brave" stance of the
New Yorkers reported from hour to hour on TV.

I've really been very down, mentally, this whole week. Feeling deprived
of the meaning (or the meaning of meaning) in just about everything.
Growing more and more addicted to the CNN... Not depressed, but utterly
confused, disappointed to so many things, species, ideas, movements,
perspectives, persons - myself (and yes, certain amount of what's been
going on the list, also) included.

Terrified, I almost forgot to say. Horrified to the point of wanting to
vomit.

Sad. And angry. And angry at having to think it over and over again,
inside my own head, as I'm going to do here...

Actually it's kind of strange, that I, who, as you know, do not consider
myself that much of a leftist nowadays, should have come think of the
"all this" so predominantly from a leftist perspective.

This is one of the things that have been haunting me: among so much and
so seemingly spontaneous talk about the "responsibility" of  "us" -
"the West", "the America" - to "this", i.e. about certain
"justification" for what those 19 well-shaven men did,  I'm still to
hear the question on the *lefts own* responsibility, in that case.

I mean: if there's a - smallest - justification... what in that case
about the responsibility of all (us) who have, in different contexts,
been preaching about the necessity to "strike" the "system", to "blow it
up", to "hit the enemy" at its weakest, i.e. most vulnerable, i.e.
sometimes seemingly strongest point ...

The attacks have bin Ladens "signature", they say. Well, they also have
the signature of all urgings to strike, to throw out, to hit, to reveal
... They are all about that rhetoric finally gone abominably awry. What
have *we* done to prevent that happening? What will we do to prevent it
happening again?

As I wrote in one of my earliest notes to "this":

I think I have seen the eyes that have seen the eyes of Osama bin Laden.
My hand
was helping
to lift the hand that
rose to point to the
target.

Well, maybe that connects to one of the oldest problems of the left:
maybe there never really were that many actual leftists at all - just
followers after followers believing others being the real leftists...

I've become to think pretty much along the lines suggested by Tamir
Ansary (quoted in the post by Alan Sondheim, September 15...), and I
almost  fully agree with Ron Silliman in his excellent analysis of the
"lefts" dilemmas today.

To me, it's spurious to compare, and weigh against each others, the
attacks on the Towers, and, say, the Clinton bombings in Sudan, when
clearly both, ultimately, result from the same plan. It's sad, and
embarrassing, to see a mind like Noam Chomsky's to fall into that
trap...

Yes, the Nazis keep coming to mind. Yet I believe the enemy, or time, or
the stakes, are worse than that this time around. Much worse.

That's one of the saddening things: that it's so open, to everyone, to
see what is at stake - the whole of the civilization, the modernization,
the idea of (any kind of) progress, human dignity and rights, literacy,
freedom to speech, to gender, to be even... and yet, truly, it doesn't
seem to hit home.

So, is there, behind all the talk about the culpability of the
Americans, of the "we" or the "they" getting what they've been asking
for, a more deep-going indifference towards the civilization as such?

Which, then, may not deserve to be defended that strongly?

No, of course I don't think that way. As an old leftist, I keep thinking
about the Front Populaire against Nazism - how long it took to build up
(they tell). The enormous amount of prejudices (and hair-splitting about
the "real" or "ultimate" "responsibility" of "ruling classes", on the
left, and the "reality" of the danger, on both sides) to be left behind
before the democrats, right and left, in France,then in the whole
Europe, later on the world scale in the WW2 could join forces - to what
still is the most spectacular, if not only, permanent result of all the
left's struggles - the victory over Nazism.

"Do you think this is going to lead to the World War Three", Kirsi asked
me during the first hours.  "No", I reassured her, "this *is* it." I
still think that way. I'm afraid I sound a little less reassured day by
day...

Yes: I do think it's a war. True, every time Bush (the-son-of-a-Bush)
walks to the screen, I feel embarrassed about his "Dad, look, I've got
my own war here now" vein of putting things. Still: he is the elected
leader of the leading nation of the civilized world that's under an
extremely dangerous attack. There's no way around it, nor need there be.
He is my commander-in-chief in this. Period.

Besides, much of what many representatives of "the Bush administration"
are saying makes perfect sense to me. The idea of a "new kind of war" in
many ways  echoes what we are used to hear from the "progressive"
security policy experts: how the real threats have ceased to be nation
states, armies, bombs - being poisons, environment, weather, and
terrorism instead.

Yes, I too am concerned about the perspective of premature efforts at
seizing "the prime suspect", not to speak about bombing Afghanistan. But
not because we supposedly lack evidence on the man (his interviews alone
would suffice...).

On the contrary: because that might compromise the longer perspective,
shroud from view the necessity to wage a *really* long term ... hmmm ...
battle.

Which will involve new ways of attack, but new modes of defence also.

This is the most important, and to my view, the most neglected point
here. That we are under an absolute necessity to defence ourselves, and
that we can do that by (cannot do that without) *changing our society*,
our civilization, our way of life - which haven't necessarily be to the
worse.

That among this tremendous sadness, there are glints of an enormous hope
- of people getting together, starting to do something together, to some
of the most important issues determining the future of the planet, of
all us.

That, for these reasons also, the left needs be involved in the defence,
not critizising it from outside.

Yes, I believe it's time to dig the good old Gandhi out from beneath the
rubble of cold and other wars - and start thinking how the doctrine of
passive resistance might be applied in this new war.

To prevent the next strike, which I too fear may well involve biological
and/or nuclear components.

To take new, decisive steps towards further disarmament, nuclear and
otherwise.

Now, when the need for these kinds of measures, for once, is so evident
to everybody.

But nothing on these lines can be done, if we refuse to accept the
common cause - the need to preserve the humanity, the civilization.

In the final analysis (as we used to say), the problem is not about
seeing and acknowledging the enemy (although this is important too) -
it's about our willingness to come together...

There  will be societal changes, whether we want them or not. Not all of
them will have any bearing on democracy and freedom - like tightening
the security on airplanes (ok), fewer flights (well, so nice you were
here already... and we *do* plan to come over during the Autumn...).
Others will be more problematic...

What I'm specifically interested in is the now almost inevitable
perspective of "more documented life" (Bill Gates (!)) - fraught with
dangers, of course, but also containing seeds to something new,
including the idea of everybody as publisher - which of course is
already manifested, in a rudimental form, in the present day Internet...

Which may well be one of the main lines of defence...

...After all... it was build to fight terrorism... by the US military...

None of these and other things can be done overnight, and none without
the ingenuity, the innovativeness...

...of the people?

...of America?

...of the left?

...of the poetry?

Well, in my first notes, again, I also wrote about "nothing, the least
the poetry, being the same / any more".

(I also wrote: "Ich bin (sic) ein Amerikaner jetzt...")

And, in a mock-brechtian note: "What a time! When / talk about the
meaning of meaning is almost crime, in the face / of this meaningless /
crime so  / full of meaning..."

As you know, I had made the decision not to write in Finnish any more,
and was wondering whether I could start learning to write in English
instead.

Now, there seemed to be a double impossibility to write (and I was also
frustrated by the futility of the question as such: what difference
would it make in which language I decide to fall silent (this one also
coming from Brecht...)

To be honest, this was one of the reasons to be angry to "the
perpetrators": what right did they have to come and muddle the quiet
waters of my self-complacent post-leftist life of mulling about the
value of language and poetry ...

Of having interesting conversations on the meaning of meaning.

The word *interesting* seeming to be impossible to use any more.

Then I remembered how I spent the night before the strike  -  i.e.
translating some of my dadaistic sonnets into English.

Here's one draft, translated, in ways, back, not to, but towards,  the
73rd sonnet of Shakespeare, from which the Finnish "original" ("Joko Ono
Mato") was a pseudo-homophonic version:

John Winston Worm

that time. Of year. No roots. No rats
o yellow leaves, o run, or few do hang
upon these boughs... So what? Against the odds
"bare-ruined-choirs". Muchos Grazias. The bats

in me this mean, this twilight, nights
as after sunset. Poising in west
by and by black night. Japanese tights
death's second shell. Salsa in the rest

my fatal past-time, glowing of such halo
on the ashes as of this youth: then die
then death-bed, the here in Borsalino

consumed by taxi. Amen. Hand nourished by
what thou perceivest, so make thy love more strong
to love that well, which thou must leave ere long

To me, at least, incredibly in ways, this humble draft speaks rather
straightforwardly about what has happened, since.

As it should.

As all poetry ("even my poetry") should?

And what about this other draft, where the remote origins are a stanza
in Pushkin's Yevgeni Onegin (the one with the shot) and the Helsinki
tabloid's on the Versaci murder in summer 1997:

Paparazzi. Now (Onegin One)

Pressing at chest the new hand now
he wonders: who. Ash in his expression
gets unseen - masks to borrow,
for each to allow own, to give the cushion.

A number of steeps he downwards stoops
routinely frothing - frolicking,
with many a wealthy client shivering.
Turnkeys get turned. We see the licking.

Escaping arrived here three days past:
now is no more! To a miamibeachian
cast of eternity has over-gone,

and oops! full blossom of the vibes now knows
the one, who at stages used to shine,
to cross, to over-trot, to bet, behave.

This could be offered as a contorted mirror of, and for, what happened -
including all this rummaging about the responsibility, the who did what,
the implications, ways to act against, the dangers of getting divided,
ways to come together...

Maybe the poetry, for one, need *not* change, after all. Maybe *that's*
the way for poetry to change, now as always.

Maybe that's the way it already *did* change.

As it should?

In any case, I'm sure that poetry, understood as working with mysteries,
uncertainties, and, yes, that which does not have a meaning, voice,
words, yet, is crucially important at these kind of times when people
need to think "all over again".

Of course, it's only poetry. Poetry never was the whole life. But in a
way it is all about resistance - and very often passive at that...

Well, and at least writing this has been an enormous relief to me.

I wrote it to you. I couldn't bring myself to write to the list - it
didn't seem appropriate, in a way, yet. I wanted address someone I
know... but of course you are free to circulate this, in any ways you
might find advisable.

And it would be interesting to hear what you think about some of the
things I said.

Hey, there's the word - *interesting*.

I'm moving on.

We are going to make it.

We are going to survive.

Love,

Leevi

I’ve been reading the list lately with great interest, a continuation of the
discussions that are raging in classrooms, staffrooms, at home, in the car
on the way to work, in the playground – I could have just said everywhere
but that doesn’t convey how thoroughly absorbed in this crisis we are/I am.
Factor in the newsprint, TV programs, letters and articles on the net, plus
having three sons who are the right age for cannon fodder, recently teaching
World War 1 – an act of terrorism by a small country against an empire, a
blank cheque issued by an ally, the rapidity of entry in war, the difficulty
of getting out (old news) and, if I remember correctly, the left putting
aside internationalism for patriotism  – and yes, I acknowledge that for all
the similarities, there are also differences. (And will the world ever be
the same? Well, yes and no, as usual.)

Okay, it’s obvious I have nothing clear, not panicking but seeing the
possibility of it.

I thought Ron Silliman’s post was a very thoughtful analysis of the
difficulties the left faced but Lawrence Upton posed some equally valid
questions. Clearly, we agree that the terrorists who organized the attack on
the US must be tried and punished but it must be proved that Bin Laden and
his organization is the one. This hasn’t been done and the recent post
suggesting other possibilities is worrying, in that going after the wrong
man is mistaken in a number of ways. Is there no chance the matter could be
pursued through legal means? I know it’s not as satisfying in the short term
but now, as much as ever, it seems important to assert our faith in law
rather than force. I don’t see it happening but isn’t it better to be
excluded from influence than to go along with what one believes to be wrong?
This isn’t a rhetorical question – as an Australian, I am constantly
witnessing our pseudo left – the ALP (the Alternative Liberal Party, as a
colleague recently said) making precisely this trade off.

An all out war on terrorism is problematic, to put it mildly, ( a sense that
this might be exactly what the instigators of the recent terror want doesn’t
help) and my feeling is that it should be preventative rather than
aggressive (the terminology is confusing – if war is declared on terrorists,
doesn’t that imply that they are not criminals but guerillas/ activists? –
if terrorists confined their targets to the military, would that make them
less “criminal” and more “political”? – has the West confined itself to
military targets in waging war/ pursuing political objectives? (I’m not
trying to score points – have always run in circles that grow worse these
days).
I’ll start again – terrorism is the product of circumstances and, as long as
the circumstances persist, so will terrorism. Imprisoning or executing
individual terrorists creates martyrs and their brothers, sisters, cousins,
friends et alia step forward to replace them and yet these crimes must be
punished where possible. However, to say, we must destroy terrorism, as
though all that’s required is the will and the might, flies in the face of
the British experience in Northern Ireland. If the Brits could not eliminate
terrorism there, what chance do the Americans have of eliminating it in
Afghanistan or Israel or Iraq etc.?

Going to war won’t do it, bombing cities definitely won’t do it and, if Tony
Blair  had any sense of European history, he might have pointed that out
instead of making that rather odd remark about standing by the US now just
as they stood by the Brits during the Blitz  (the US sold the arms and
supplies but they certainly didn’t go to war – was Blair aware of this? How
could he not be? Is it a covert way of hedging his bets? Locally, our Prime
Minister is taking full advantage of the chance to look serious and
responsible but voices are being raised to ask precisely what commitment, in
military or human terms, is intended. It’s not that most Australians don’t
feel the grief, the bewilderment, the horror, that those of you who are
American must feel,  but the fear is, in part, what are we getting in to –
and equally, what is the world getting into. I can understand that the US
wants the emotional support of its allies but military support escalates the
crisis into a global catastrophe. And, to be quite practical for a moment,
if the US can’t defeat a country the size of Afghanistan ( mind you, I’m not
sure that they can) would the addition of  Britain, France, Germany, Russia
(surely they’d know better) Australia etc make an appreciable difference
except in terms of widening the conflict.

I’m an insignificant person in an unimportant country and, as I don’t
believe in a God, I can’t even pray for peace, or that the politicians who
make the decisions will think carefully before they engage in actions from
which there is no retreat. I’m not even sure what the point of this post is
except to connect somehow. That line from Yeats comes and goes, even though
it’s not quite appropriate – “The good lack all conviction and the worst are
full of passionate intensity” – maybe I come across as a prime example but,
for all my meanderings and quibbles, I want so much for us, any of us,  not
to go to war –

I could start the dance again but –

I never know how to sign off and shouldn’t take it seriously but
occasionally one wishes one could convey the warmth, sympathy, the desire to
help and heal which, even person to person, I’m not much good at.

My good wishes to you all,

Geraldine

I wanted to publicly thank Barrett Watten
for this thoughtful point by point analysis
of Ron Silliman's earlier post....

I hope, Barrett, this piece will someday appear in your collected prose!!!!!!!!!!

And want to ask Ron about why he thinks waving the flag and supporting
what he calls "action" (meaning, specifically, a stepping up of MILITARY action)
will help "the left" make "far more crucial arguments that need to be made right now."

What are these far more crucial arguments, Ron?

Ron, could you try to convince me,, who is more inclined (and not out of habit) to agree
with Barry than with Bush or you? Or do you think the sway of "popular opinion,"
which you swear comes BEFORE the government/media's stance, is enough to
carry you through (at least till more civilians, both "ours" and "theirs" are killed...)

thanks (in advance),

Chris

TRB FROM WASHINGTON
Fault Lines=20
by Peter Beinart



      Post date 09.20.01 | Issue date 10.01.01    =20

Coming home last Friday night, I stumbled upon a candlelight vigil. =
Hundreds of my Dupont Circle neighbors were walking gravely down Q =
Street, holding signs and dispensing leaflets. As I stopped to watch, a =
man pulled up on his bicycle, surveyed the scene, and began to scream. =
"Why don't you just commit suicide?" he yelled at the marchers. A =
policeman rushed over and tried to quiet him down: "None of that," he =
said, "this is a vigil. No politics." "My brother died in New York," the =
man answered, "and these fuckers..." And then he sped off.=20

But the policeman was wrong. What the bicyclist had noticed was that the =
placards all said things like, "No Eye for an Eye," and "No More War." A =
leaflet demanded "No further U.S. violence." ("Further," a nice touch.) =
The cop's "no politics" plea was wishful thinking. In fact, this =
country's days-long hiatus from politics is already over. And the =
political debate that will frame the coming weeks is clear: Has America =
oppressed the Muslim world? Or, stated differently, does America have =
the moral authority to go to war?

The Nation answered almost immediately. "[T]his is not really the war of =
democracy versus terror that the world will be asked to believe in the =
coming days," wrote Robert Fisk in the magazine's October 1 issue. "It =
is also about US missiles smashing into Palestinian homes and US =
helicopters firing missiles into a Lebanese ambulance in 1996 and =
American shells crashing into a village called Qana and about a Lebanese =
militia--paid and uniformed by America's Israeli ally--hacking and =
raping and murdering their way through refugee camps." In other words, =
it's about America's support for Israel.

The left has proved remarkably creative over the years at blaming =
virtually any Middle Eastern malfeasance--from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait =
to repression in the Arab world--on the Jewish State. And Fisk continues =
that tradition, suggesting that the "hacking and raping and murdering" =
at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps helped provoke last week's =
attacks--even though Sabra and Shatila took place in 1982, when Osama =
bin Laden had not yet turned against the U.S. and was actually fighting =
side by side with the CIA in Afghanistan. (Fisk further illustrates his =
idiosyncratic theory of history when he writes, "Our broken promises, =
perhaps even our destruction of the Ottoman Empire[!], led inevitably to =
this tragedy.")

But if blaming terrorism on America's alliance with Israel was always =
tricky, today it is downright bizarre. After all, over the last year and =
a half, Washington has pushed Israel into offering the Palestinians a =
state in almost all of the West Bank and Gaza, with its capital in =
Jerusalem, and helped convince Israel to withdraw from Lebanon. It is a =
good barometer of Fisk's intellectual honesty that he says Muslims are =
right to hate America because of Israel's occupation of southern =
Lebanon, but neglects to mention that, thanks in part to America, Israel =
no longer occupies southern Lebanon.

Then there is Fisk's second example of American oppression of Muslims: =
U.S. sanctions against Iraq. It is now conventional wisdom among =
American liberals that the Muslim world has every right to be enraged by =
our vicious policy toward the people of Iraq. In news articles about =
Arab anti-Americanism after the attack, The Boston Globe wrote that =
sanctions have caused "widespread suffering among Iraqis," and The =
Atlanta Journal-Constitution explained that they are responsible for =
"malnutrition and disease." But both these statements are false. As =
Michael Rubin noted in these pages ("Food Fight," June 18), =
Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq--which is subject to exactly the same =
sanctions as the rest of the country--suffers virtually no malnutrition. =
In fact, infant mortality rates in the North are lower than they were =
before the Gulf war. That's because, under revised UN sanctions, Iraq is =
now the world's second largest exporter of oil, and those exports =
provide Kurdish authorities plenty of revenue to buy medicines and food. =
The reason children elsewhere in the country go hungry is that Saddam =
resells needed supplies in order to fund his military. In recent years =
the United States has actually intercepted several Iraqi ships exporting =
food.

But perhaps the most pitiful thing about Fisk and The Nation's efforts =
to rationalize bin Laden's hatred of the United States is that they =
don't even correspond to what bin Laden himself says. (The left had this =
problem during the cold war, too--Moscow was always changing its script =
without informing its apologists in the West.) Longtime bin Laden =
watchers know he has never been especially concerned with the plight of =
the Palestinians. In a 1998 paper by Ely Karmon for the Washington =
Institute for Near East Policy, Abdel-Bari Atwan, editor of London's =
Al-Quds al-Arabi newspaper, noted that bin Laden "has been criticized in =
the Arab world" for his relative indifference to the "Palestinian =
issue." Nor has bin Laden been a big supporter of Saddam. When the Iraqi =
dictator invaded Kuwait, bin Laden actually offered to send his men to =
defend Saudi Arabia against Iraq.

In bin Laden's mind, America's greatest offense--by far--is its military =
presence in his home country of Saudi Arabia. (The bin Laden-sponsored =
attacks on U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam occurred on the =
eighth anniversary of the dispatch of U.S. troops to the Gulf.) And =
that's a harder line for Western leftists to peddle. Because bin Laden =
isn't upset at the United States for bolstering Riyadh's oppressive =
policies--after all, the Saudi government's views on individual freedom =
and the status of women roughly mirror his own. Bin Laden is upset =
simply because non-Muslims live in the Holy Land around Mecca and =
Medina. His first priority is banishing Christians and Jews from Saudi =
Arabia. And his second priority is banishing Christians and Jews from =
every other Muslim country. As he told ABC News in 1998, "Allah ordered =
us in this religion to purify Muslim land of all non-believers, and =
especially the Arabian Peninsula."

When you think about it, this is not a very original idea. Although =
everyone is calling our struggle with bin Laden a "new war," in many =
ways it is a continuation of the same war the United States has been =
fighting since 1989. Bin Laden, after all, is an ethnic cleanser. And =
the United States is the only powerful country on Earth willing to take =
up arms to make sure that people of different religions and races can =
live together. The main difference between September 11 and what came =
before is that bin Laden desires ethnic cleansing on a scale far greater =
than the Hutus and the Serbs, a scale that has only one true twentieth =
century parallel.

If Fisk and The Nation really want to argue that America brought the =
World Trade Center attack on itself, they shouldn't delude themselves. =
They are not defending the Palestinians' right to a state or the Iraqis' =
right to medicine. They are defending a Muslim's right not to live with =
a non-Muslim. And in so doing they are renouncing this country's most =
sacred principles--principles that saved countless Muslim lives in =
Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s. When the left assembles at its =
candlelight vigils and peace marches in the coming weeks, let it =
proclaim this honestly. And other Americans will survey the scene, and =
scream.

Are we free to start (seriously) joking about this situation as a
transition toward critiquing it?  If so, then the re-naming of this
mission is obvious:

Elizabeth, I have lots of thoughts on this topic - it's something I
tackled (with mixed success I think) in the first "COMBO x/tra" (a "poets
& painters conversation w/ my brother).  Maybe I'll post that but in the
meantime I would just want to emphasize what I perceive to be a HUGE
difference between irony and apathy.  To wit: Frederick Douglass's comment
from his brialliant speech, "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?"
Given to an audience of mostly white abolitionists (who no doubt were
patting themselves on the back, and not without some reason) Douglass
spends much of this speech critiquing them and, especially, the language
with which they're framing the anti-slavery struggle:

"At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed.
O! had I the ability, and could I reach the nations ear, I would, to-day,
pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering
sarcasm, and stern rebuke."

When Douglass says, "The feeling of the nation must be quickened" it seems
to me he's talking about the function of irony - the way in which, by
undercutting trusted vocabularies, it wakes people up to the necessity of
new ones.  I mean, what has Bush's response to our present situation been
but a running catalogue of Manifest Destiny cliches that 80% (according to
polls) of the country has readily accepted largely because (I would guess)
of their familiarity and the comfort of the familiar (even the odiously
familiar) in a chaotic time?  Well, look: if there was ever a time for
"genX irony" it's probably now.  Flag-as-Transitional-Object arguments
aside (and I found those arguments pretty convincing I think) the time for
comfort should probably give way soon to a time for ethical shouting and
political demurral: God Bless America meets Gad Blast a Mercantile, God
Bus a Mercenary, etc.

-m.

"His writing is the best thing he can do for himself.
He does dive into things he needs to understand or
come to terms with.

He’s aware of a bigger picture that is possible and
that doesn’t please him. He’s trying to handle that it
may mean he needs to make a decision. He can’t go into
making a decision right now.

How far is he from where the attacks took place? The
whole area he’s in right now, is saturated. He’s very
susceptible to that. Is there any kind of energy kind
of cleaning work he does or would be willing to do? He
can do some aroma threapy. Lavender essential oil is
simple. Put it on his pillow in a diffuser or under
his nose. One drop a day.

Has he ever had an experience in the past of losing it
on some level-- more than just depression? He could
stabilize himself. Be prepared that if there’s anymore
attacks anywhere that he’s connected to he may need
other support. Trauma support would be good, but he
may not want to do that. Would be good for you
(jessica) to keep in touch with Lori, especially if
there’s another attack.

His writing right now is going in deep.  Being born
after the holocaust -- that cellular memory flares
right up in him. A support group comes up as being
helpful. Something dealing with the trauma. Person to
person and verbal and hearing other people. Verbal is
good form of expression for him, especially if he’s
written about it first. Person to person, not
necessarily lead by a therapist."

I work in New York City at The Rockefeller University, and we were given
the opportunity to hear a lecture yesterday on NYC's plans in case of
emergency terrorism. The person who spoke to the University community was
Jerry Hower, I believe, but I know that the spelling of his name is
incorrect. He is the man who has developed NYC's emergency plan against
terrorism. He admitted that he had thought through all types of
terrorism--chemical, biological, and small bombs, etc. But, he said that
unfortunately he never imagined a 767 flown into the WTC.

The chemical materials he discussed were:
Sarin
Tabun
VX
Soman
Cyanide
Mustard/Blistering agents

The biological materials:
Anthrax
Small pox
Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB)

He said that he is least concerned with chem warfare because it would take
so much to contaminate a large body of the population, and he included the
NYC water supply. They do test the water supply but not dynamically like
the Israelis do, he admitted. He had just visited Israel to see how often
and what types of testing the Israelis do on their water supply. But, NYC
uses 1.2B gallons of water/day, and he believes that to contaminate the
city's water supply on a level that would hurt a large body of the
population is still very difficult. He did not, however, rule out targeting
distinct areas of the city.

As for the biological warfare, he said that with anthrax, etc. we get a
window of approximately 3 days. He is concerned with this, and believes
that NYC will be a target of bio warfare rather soon. The city has created
an algorithm to track the purchasing of certain over the counter products
from pharmacies. The city knows how many types of diuretics, etc. are sold
on a day to day basis, and a report is run every morning at 5:00 a.m. The
Director of the Office of Emergency Management reads it first thing every
day, he said. As soon as the numbers jump over a certain threshold, the
stockpile is released. Every amublance in the city has vaccines for chem-bio.

I have been hearing people say that the "terrorists" have finished with
NYC, that they will hit somewhere else next, which I do not believe, and
Hower said he did not believe that in the least either.

Finally, and this is something I used in rebuttal to Ron's points, the
Nobel prize winner Joshua Lederberg who has consulted many different
administrations in biological warfare, etc, got up to say a few words. He
said that his biggest fear was what continued to provide him the most deep
seated anxiety. He said that this event and the others that are inevitably
to come from both sides of the confict will change human's "essential
goodness" and alter the terrain of morality and ethics. He feared this more
than anything, which got me to thinking. Perhaps...if this were
true...perhaps people who have been continuous victims of terror had
already had this happen to them? Does this make them "bad" people? No, I
think not. I think that they have been altered, say even "re-programmed
humans." Again, this is all so sad, and if we were to set out on an all out
offensive, what happens?

European countries have begun to roundup suspected terrorists. (Yahoo!
Roundup dem dogies!" -Little Bush.) Something that should have been done
long before this. In this country too.
Even though European leaders say they are behind Bush, they are counseling
caution. This they've learned after two world wars being fought on their
turf, leveling whole cities, not just a few buildings.
I also think that this incident is, hopefully, growing pains for this
country. And there'll be more to come.
Right now what I see is a leadership consisting mainly of adolescents, as US
Culture, including its education system, is geared more to graduating
producers/consumers than growups. (Talking about growups, I just reviewed
Hayden Carruth's new book, "Dr. Jazz.")
The best our political leadership seems to be able to say, when asked why
the tragedy happened, is, "They're envious of us." Talk about a shallow
critique! This is not what the American People need to hear. This is what
children need to hear. "That kid hit you, Johnny, because you're white and
handsome, not because you raped his sister."
So I see the terrorists as teachers, from whom I hope we learn to look into
ourselves with a critical, and loving, eye, and not become them.

Subject:      The  Flag As Transitional Object
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

>Nick Piombino's post earlier on the flag's role not as an icon of
>war-mongering, but as a transitional object in the grieving process, makes
>perfect sense to me. (Ron Silliman)

As I've written elsewhere, the flag is not a transitional object but a
symbol of national identity. I cannot dissociate American history from that
symbol. While I do not see the same aggression in flying the flag as was
evident in the Gulf War, I think the innocence of its use as a symbol of
human, rather than national, solidarity is a precise desire to forget that
history. (Barrett Watten)


I did not say what I said about transitional objects in order to be an
apologist for war. I am trying to draw a distinction between the usual
employment of the symbolism of the flag in leftist or pacifist terms,
especially as it was critiqued during the Vietnam conflict, and its
current, immediate function as a transitional object for those in mourning.
When I burnt my draft card as part of the war resistance movement in 1967,
it was at a time when I was already deeply depressed and mourning over the
dead on all sides. Barrett is right in preparing the way for rational
pacifism at the outbreak of this conflict. However, timing is everything in
gaining public support for a cause. It is the very media power of the
terrorists acts that we have to find a way to combat. To show impatience
towards the millions of people in New York who feel terrified, at this very
moment,  of a follow-up attack, in giving up their rage and mourning would
be, I feel, risking a setback for a effective and rational anti-war
movement. We veterans of 60's peace efforts may be in a position to go
about the effort of winning public attention for potential innocent victims
abroad, as well as American victims of further terrorism here, as well as
our soldiers abroad, or here, but any such movement must also deal
empathically with the entire situation of loss, mourning and with any
coordinated governmental manipulation of those feelings into a
justification of further killing.

To view the function of the flag as a transitional object at this time I
think might be one effective way to begin to short circuit the terrorist
goal of creating chaos, divisiveness, confusion, especially among those in
a position to try to decrease the tone of bellicosity. Certainly we do not
want to engender a tone of bellicosity among each other here on the poetics
list. For example, I don't think it was helpful for George Bowering to ask
Tom Bell, when Tom said he would buy a flag, if  Tom would now buy a gun.
Nothing Tom Bell has said, or for that matter, anyone has said in support
of  using the concept of transitional object in understanding some of the
reasons people want to display flags, in this context,  has been employed,
as far as I can tell, to support war.

It is also very clear to me that Barrett Watten (and I wouldn't expect him
to) does not have very much knowledge about Winnicott's use, at least 15
years after the death of Freud, of the concept of the transitional object,
which emerged along with the increased knowledge of the human psychological
development via the work of the British Object Relations school of
psychoanalysis.(It is important to note that Winnicott gained much of his
insight into childhood developmental psychology in treating, as a
pediatrician, children during the London bombings of World War II- see
"Winnicott" by Adam Phillips, Harvard, 1988, pp. 61-97).Much of this work
was confirmed later in experimental work via Margaret Mahler's observation
of infant and early childhood development. The idea of a symbol is a
concept quite different than the idea of a transitional object. A symbol is
entirely understood as a function of a cognitive experience alone. In the
concept of the transitional object the physical presence of the object has
a special meaning in combining with the physical, emotional and cognitive
experience of its function. When people wrap flags around caskets and drape
them on buildings or children hold them in their hands they are utilizing a
physical holding presence of support during the grieving period. This can
only be temporary, because in order to work through mourning, we must
eventually let go of this emotional struggle for holding, or we could not
get on with life by accepting the finality of the loss of the dead.
Essentially, then, a transitional object supports a necessary, but also
temporary, period of (unconscious) denial, during an emerging set of very
frightening and agonizing feelings, including an awareness of mortality
itself. It is virtually impossible to process such immense anxiety and loss
instantaneously, or even rapidly, and this is why the mind gives us denial,
and mourning, to give time for the absorption of the shock and the personal
and social significance of the trauma. My hunch is that Barrett is for very
good reasons (having to do with considerable knowledge of political
history) impatient with this period of necessary denial. There is other
work in front of us, as the denial gives way, and the complete terror of
our vulnerable situation comes home to us in the naked anxiety of the
threat of  war. Barrett is warning us about the potential furious
destructiveness that could be unleashed when the stunned period of mourning
and denial ends, and the new cycle of destructiveness and
counter-destructiveness begins. Nevertheless, I feel that to confront a
very traumatized, confused country, many of whom are undergoing various
degrees of post traumatic stress syndrome, with a premature expectation of
empathy with future imagined loss, is unrealistic, and at worst,
dangerously devisive. Although for reasons of national defense, we all
posture strength, in reality we are mostly feeling not only some degree of
loss, but also a sense of humiliation at having suffered a defeat. This
blow is a narcissistic blow to our national self-esteem as much as it a
physical loss of people. This vulnerability and the ensuing confusion, as
well as ambivalence, must be part of the calculation of any rational
emerging anti-war movement.

Finally, a distinction must be made between the experience of those who
have  more directly witnessed this event- someone might like to write to
James Sherry about this- and those who have witnessed it on television.
There are greatly varying degrees and types of post traumatic anxiety.
Those who have witnessed the destruction of the WTC, or were in or near the
building, or have been directly effected in losing a loved one are
undergoing kinds of experiences and are in need of kinds of help not
usually needed by others. Post traumatic stress disorder can lead to
prolonged feelings of alienation towards others, to a need to avoid
ordinary enjoyments and contacts with other people, and easily triggered
rage, anxiety and depression. There is often a tendency to withdraw from
others and a tendency to withdraw from enjoyment of any type. We must try
to be sensitive to the numbers of people involved and the fact that here,
in New York, they are everywhere around us. This must also be true at the
seat of our government in Washington, DC.  Victims of post traumatic stress
syndrome are often dazed and emotionally volatile and don't even realize
the full extent of their psychological debilitation, which can rapidly get
worse if not treated. I feel that  enlightened political response must
include empathy for human psychological needs for recovery and a varying
range of emotional response. But again, Barrett is right to warn us, to
challenge us as to our rapidly emerging responsibility to understand the
plight of potential future victims. At the same time, we must recognize
that our country has not killed anyone in response to this specific
atrocity yet.

Perhaps we should consider the possible significance of our national
grieving over the bombing of the Oklahoma office building. At that time no
physical response was possible, except the arrest, trial and final
execution of the terrorist, one of our own citizens. Possibly our
collective awareness of the fact that virtually no physical punishment of
anyone, or for that matter any other than symbolic physical responses was
immediately possible, and that no punishment could be much of any help in
our national mourning may be on some unconscious or subliminal helpful in
developing a cautious, rational response towards this devastating atrocity.
But, of course, we had Clinton then. And now, we have Bush.

And finally, this quote from Barrett Watten's amazing book "Bad History"
from Atelos in 1998:
"Who will save us? Intellectuals- split off from the mass of revolutionary
clouds returning from the daily fog bank? The fog moves back to reveal
smoky haze rising over burnt-out districts of Los Angeles, o intellectuals,
you who speak as if there were no one to hear you! But this smoky haze has
risen again, as we knew it would. Save us from our instincts and deny our
necessary acts of self-destruction o intellectuals!"

barrett, thanx for your carefully composed thoughts---though your
point-by-point anaylsis of ron's post is on, uhm, point, i believe
you've rather sacrificed (to employ an esp. ungainly phrase now) the
spirit for the letter...

i mean, in the end, any and all attempts at capturing "public
sensibility"---even via e.g. presumably accurate polling---will
capture only a portion of what's "out there" (and "in here")... and i
took ron's post to be a call to those with a particular sensibility
(and perhaps sensitivity) about things (in general) to wake up &
smell the new roses...

now i'm as much a fan of the old left, and the old new left (etc.) as
anyone, and still find much in the various documents of that era (of
which, i take it, you consider yourself a bona fide member, and with
good reason) to go back to, esp. at times like these... and i too had
and have problems with ron's apparent advocacy of a military approach
to our problems, up to & including war (whatever he means by
"war"---as i do find some slippage there, in his post)...

and i certainly don't wish to speak here as an apologist for ron...

but really, barrett---don't you sense, at least a little, that it
might not be inappropriate to observe that if the left in this
country *had* been successful to the extent many of us had hope(d) it
might be, the u.s. govt might *not* be on the verge of what it's on
the verge of presently?... this is not to condemn the left or any
such thing... but to ask, can't we do better?---as a kind of
pre-consideration to marching out the anti-war horses... and also
perhaps to say that we mustn't be slapping ourselves silly (on our
backs, i mean) as to the efficacy of our (e.g.) ideological
analyses---b/c in the end, they haven't quite resulted in the sorts
of political realities we've been, uh, shooting for (ugh)...

ysee, this is why i like esp. brian stefans's recent post---b/c it
*doesn't* end with a bang (sorry)... and hey---i'm not unaware of the
fact that, to a/effect policy on any level, "we" have to muster some
provisional agenda rather quickly, which, i'm happy to say, appears
to be happening (and i disagree with those who believe "we" can only
have a postmortem effect)...

anyway... it's in this spirit (again) that i took ron's post,
whatever my misgivings re several of his specific conclusions... wish
i could find a way to end this post on a question... hmmm... well
here's one, and i don't mean it rhetorically:  shouldn't we be ending
our posts with questions?...

peace,

joe

We actually gave the Taliban an impossible set of demands.  They agreed to
give us bin Laden.  Suddenly that wasn't good enough.  We said, give us all
your terrorists.  An impossible task for the Taliban, logistically speaking.
They do not have the resources or the ability to know which 15 year old boys
with AK-47s are "terrorists" and which ones are not.  Many of these people
have *nothing but* guns.  Little food or water or any shelter beyond tents.
The scenario reminds me of the impossible demands delivered to Iraq by
oilman James Baker III, demands that indicate the US is merely aping
diplomacy for an underinformed group of followers back home.

i have been wary of getting involved in responding to ron's long and
thoughtful (but ultimately, i think,  unsatisfying) post, because i simply
can't take a lot of conflict now and have to preserve my energies
carefully.  however, it struck me that in spite of the admirably deliberate
and careful exposition of the elements and points of argumentation, and the
obvious anguished ambivalence involved in those deliberations, the post is
fundamentally concerned with a particular "realpolitik" that allows bush et
al to dictate the terms of that reality.  in the tradition of
anglo-american analytic philosophy, it sets in motion a singular line of
argumentation that remains locked within and committed to a narrow and even
dead-end view of what's possible.  while it struck me intuitively that the
post was overly reactive and letting bush set its terms, others like
lawrence, barrett and brian have been more thorough and articulate about
why the post is problematic.  i would say in defense of the post, though,
that although it is presented as the end-product of a thoughtful
self-confrontation, i see it as an initial response, and one that, like
many folks' here, is bound to open up as it encounters alternative
possibilities.  so, it is productive in the debate and clarification it has
engendered; though i for one can't engage in a lot of debate right now, i
am following the process respectfully from the sidelines.
on another note, here at the U of MN we have been urged by our president
Mark Yudof to, among other less objectionable things, display the flag
"proudly" wherever doing so does not violate building safety codes, and to
purchase buttons saying "we stand together."  i was quite alarmed at the
thought of being urged to purchase things that articulated a sentiment of
conformity, and to display a nationalist symbol when so many of our
courses' contents quite specifically include interrogation of the
institution of the nation-state, or discussion of the instrumentality and
constructedness of such an entity.  are we supposed to confuse our
students? is this an issue of academic freedom?  again, a friend pointed
out to me that these were suggestions, not coersions, and that no one would
be keeping track of who's naughty n nice vis a vis flag-displaying and
button-purchasing.  i am more concerned with engagement by following the
dalai lama's suggestions, being really nice to my students and friends,
affirming their creativity, intelligence and value to me --cooking,
exercising regularly and socializing seem to figure large on the self-care
agenda as well.
on yet another note, i wanted to respond to tom bell's query about
depression.  my first two years here in mn i was morbidly depressed.  in
march of my second year, my apt was burglarized and i lost my martin
classical guitar, hundreds of records from the 60s and 70s (Cream/Disraeli
Gears, Big Bro. & the Holding Co, etc), and the computer UMN had given me.
For several weeks my depression lifted dramatically; when i remarked on
this, my therapist explained that this sometimes happens in the wake of a
shock or trauma if you are extremely depressed already --the adrenaline
levels kick you out of depression for a while. (it was not a permanent
respite.)  Maybe that's what's happening now for some folks.  Also, in a
national crisis like this, i'd imagine that the idea that one could be
useful now would be a useful counter to depression for some.

I like Fisk.  A lot.  Having said that, he's got the declaration of war part
all wrong, as there is no apparent opponent.  It takes two, and one side is
not interested in revealing itself.   Also, I doubt Sharon is in any trap.
His career is full of arms trading deals.  Sharon and his pals on the Joint
Committee sold the Iranians 12,000 missiles when his competition, the
Reagan/North NSC boys, could only muster selling 100 to Iran.  And then
somebody named Bush leaked the story about the Reagan/Bush boys, because
Bush was helping to arm Saddam and Iraq and was more interested in oil than
Israel's security.  So Sharon is hardly trapped.  He's sitting on piles of
$$$ left from questionable arms deals.  Fisk also misses the fact that the
CIA and DIA were still at least indirectly funding bin Laden through the KLA
up through at least the end of 1999, deals that involved narcotrafficing and
terrorist training of KLA soldiers.  So the US and its NATO pals were
channeling millions to bin Laden when he was on the FBIs most wanted list.
Nowadays Kosovo is a calm narcostate, where everyone has a hand on the smack
and meth trade and where the drugs come from bin Laden's "Base" and German,
British, and American banks along with their private networks of spooks get
fat from the proceeds.

>

> there with his armed fighters, I asked him if he had

> Hoba, in Saudi Arabia which had just taken place - 24
> American soldiers had been killed - and he said no, it was
> not his doing, he was not responsible. He admitted that he
> knew two or three men who have since been executed,
> beheaded, by the Saudi authorities.
>
> He then said, I did not have the honour to participate

>

> are saying there's a connection, but he's never said or
> admitted responsibility for any such event and he's denied
> specifically the atrocities in the United States.
>
> Is he capable of it? Look, I'll give you one tiny
> example. The second time I met him in Afghanistan, four
> years ago, at the top of a mountain, it was cold and in the
> morning  when I woke in the camp tent, I had frost in my
> hair. He walked into the tent I was sitting in and sat down
> opposite me, cross-legged on the floor and noticed
> in the school bag I usually carry in rough country to
> keep things in, some Arabic-language newspapers and he seized
> upon these and went to the corner of the tent with a
> sputtering oil lamp and devoured the contents.
>
> For 20 minutes, he ignored us, he ignored the gunman
> sitting in the tent, he ignored me and he didn't
> even know, for example, that it was stated in one of
> the stories in the newspaper that the Iranian foreign
> minister had just visited Riyadh, his own country, Saudi
> Arabia, well, his until he lost his citizenship. So he
> seemed to me at the time to be very isolated, a cut off man,
> not the sort of person who would press a button on a
> mobile phone and say, "Put plan B into action".
>
> So I don't think you can see this as a person who
> actually participates in the sense of planning,
> step-by-step,  what happens in a nefarious attack. In other words, I
> doubt very much if he said, "Well, four airplanes, five

> here and whether it be the deaths of tens of thousands

>

A characteristic of the lunatic fringe is that they always imagine =
themselves to be especially enlightened. I'm not sure whether the =
suggestions being made on this list that America's failures have =
precipitated the slaughter of 7,000 of us remind me more of Jerry =
Falwell or of the pretenses of the terrorists themselves. I don't see =
any radical thinking going on here that might be especially enlightened =
--  these posts seem rather to have their origins in the oldfartism of =
baby boomers unable to extricate themselves from their nostalgia about =
the Vietnam era, and/or in the misguided equation of mental imbalance =
with artistic temperament that manifests itself in knee-jerk =
contrarianism. I suppose we have academia's ivory tower syndrome, in =
which theory supercedes normal human experience, to thank for this.  =
Those who are pretending to be America's cultural, intellectual and =
moral elite seem not to realize that their little end of the bell curve =
involves a complete break from real-world considerations. Who else would =
be so unmoved to action when biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons =
may well be used against us the next time. It would be quite simply =
inhuman for any person or geo-political unit to refuse to defend =
themselves against this potential holocaust. The left-right paradigm of =
politics doesn't apply.

[forward from Laura Elrick]

Hi everyone.  Laura Elrick here.  I've been reading poetics list closely
since the Sept 11 tragedy, and though I've had many responses, this is the
first time I've been able to sit down and formulate any extended thought (in
writing) about what happened to our city, the last week spent in waves of
grief and shock.  There are hundreds of thousands of posters pasted all over
the city...5000 faces so terribly dizzying.

Last night I marched from Union to Times Square with some one thousand
people.  I guess it was more an anti-war-rhetoric than an anti-war march,
though the message was confused and that was problematic. Along with many
others, I was struck by the deep contradictions we must now face if we are to
effectively critique a US military response to this horrible crime.  Barrett,
you touched on this briefly in your last post, namely, that _one_ role of the
state is (and we should support this) the protection of the safety and civil
rights of its citizens.

For example, it was clear last night that the police were functioning
primarily to protect the marchers (though done grudgingly by some of them I'm
sure, and some arrests were made) from angry bands of men, and not the other
way around as we have seen in recent anti-globalization protests.  We have to
be able to adjust to this and resist falling into "anti-authoritarianism"
just for its own sake.  One challenge is going to be shifting our signs (and
signing) to reflect a somewhat defensive position--this is not a
territorialization of space per se (as in Seattle).  In other words, what has
been a strength (loose, horizontal coalitions with no leadership) may become
a weakness if we are unable to develop a complex critique and COMMUNICATE our
positions in ways that don't alienate the people we are ostensibly standing
up for, including municipal employees working overtime to clean up a gruesome
pulp of steel and flesh.  "Whose streets? Our streets!" just ain't going to
cut it.

Yet, first and foremost, I absolutely agree with those calling for military
restraint.  It is inconceivable to me that "smoking" bin Laden out of his
"hole," while presumably also bombing the "hell" out of the widows, orphans,
and old people still alive after over two decades of war in that country,
(he's only one individual, after all, no matter how "powerful" in the popular
imagination) will save the US, much less the world, from further terrorist
attack.  In fact, as history has repeatedly shown us, excessive force by
imperialist nations (whether of a surgical aerial kind as in Iraq, or of a
messy ground invasion as in Vietnam) often creates the sustained conditions
of violence, deprivation, and, yes, hatred, for a new generation to continue
with renewed fervor the battles of their forbears.  If we've got a hundred
cells now we'll have five hundred after "operation infinite justice."

Ron, I have to say that I don't think such a view equates to hand-wringing,
though yr point about the "uniqueness" of this situation is well-taken.
Anti-military is not automatically "do nothing."  The problem with treating a
heavy (as we have been forewarned it is likely to be) military response as a
given is that it 1) overlooks the fact that building extensive judicial
coalitions might be better able to protect us from further attacks (see my
arguments below) and 2) it downplays the vital role that organized domestic
opposition might play in limiting casualties if a conflict gets out of
control, and 3) it ignores the possibility that growing international
skepticism as regards a US strike might grow into outright dissension.

There is also the very likely possibility of exacerbating (and "growing" to
use a capitalist term) the jihadi-type fundamentalist elements in the region,
most notably, of course, in Pakistan.  Imagine, for example, what it would do
for popular sentiment and political climate in the US if a nation from the
other side of the planet sent hundreds of thousands of war-planes to bomb us
for months, killing more than ten times the number killed in the WTC (over
200 times if you include effects of economic sanctions), then, having
sustained not more than one or two casualties itself, went back and had a
joyous ticker-tape parade to celebrate the "bravery" of their victory, which
was then broadcast all over the planet and commemorated in movies exported as
the cultural force of "favorable" trade agreements.  The entire Arab world
witnessed such arrogance and callousness by the US in its war on the Iraqi
people and in its aftermath (not over yet).

To those who have complained that no alternatives to a military response
exist or have been developed, I would say there are several.  In the
immediate context, as Taylor Brady and others have pointed out, a global law
enforcement collaboration (a world-wide coalition of governments agreeing to
find and try perpetrators) treating the matter as a criminal investigation
and labeling bin Laden and accomplices as mass-murderers would better insure
the eradication of terrorists.  Our press has repeatedly reported that bin
Laden's agents have lived in communities all over the world, as far away as
Hamburg, Germany.  What good will a war with Afghanistan do if agents are
spread out waiting to be "activated"?  In fact, over two hundred arrests have
already been made in England, Belgium, Germany, and the US--and yes, at the
same time, we must vigilantly guard against a racist hysteria that might
produce unjust arrests.

And of course, any such global investigation would require the cooperation
and support of the Islamic world.  No better way to this than by taking their
concerns seriously, especially as regards the continuing Israeli
encroachments into the West Bank (and virtual occupation of the Gaza) in what
amounts to state-sponsored territorial expansion that puts both Palestinians
and Israelis at risk and has been opposed by nearly every nation of the world
except the US.  "Abandoning Israel" is of course an extreme-and not the only
option as regards a re-assessment of US policy there.  As well, the sanctions
still crippling the innocent populations of Iraq who have no more to do with
terrorist activity than you or I, is a misery lived daily for millions.

We could also start the process of collectively demanding a public
examination of US policies in the region (cold-war and before). Such an
examination needs to take place in a public forum, as a civic investigation,
similar to the truth commissions that were begun after Vietnam but were never
completed.  Over 6000 innocent civilians living in its financial capital were
murdered-we deserve more than a passing mention of a CIA codename, apt as it
is.  This is hardly an "extreme" demand, and certainly not one that excuses
the abhorrent criminality of the act committed against us.  In fact it is one
that all public intellectuals, be they poets or not, should support if they
believe that citizens have a right to know what their government
representatives have done in their name, and unfortunately, how it has now
endangered them.

Such a demand would be made along a continuum of demands that have been made
by movements worldwide, many of which, I might add, are likely to be
jeopardized by the political repercussions of this brutal and retrograde
attack.  The Civil Rights Movement, the Anti-Corporate-Globalization Mvmt,
the Anti-Death Penalty Mvmt, the Anti-Militarism Mvmt, the Women's Mvmt,
cross-border Labor initiatives-all have been calling for a drastic change in
national and global economic policy, especially as regards uneven development
of marginalized nations for some time now-and all are likely to take a severe
hit if the US war-machine succeeds in shutting out/up all dissent with
"patriotism" (not to mention increased powers of surveillance and a
devolution of individual civil rights-how convenient.  Such "emergency"
procedures also helped pave the way for the Palmer Raids and McCarthyism).
Until that unfortunate time, there are many points for cooperation among
these various groups-and they are already focusing their energies there.

Now we too are victims.  Isn't it time we demand they drop the rhetoric that
portrays this situation as a choice between war or terrorism and begin the
complicated process of becoming citizens of the world?

Walter,

Thank you for your detailed and very useful reply. I remember your remarks
because in the same symposium (called "revolutionary poetics," I think) I was
part of the final, overview panel which also included Carla Harriman and
Bruce Andrews. I used a quote from you to point to the radical potential of
translation as a genre, how a poet/translator may have the ability -if it
chooses to- to subvert a movement or style both in the original and target
culture in the process of  "transplanting." I was not making nor am I
qualified to make any comments on specific Korean poets. The subversion I am
referring to can occur in the poetics (horizontal authority?) or in the
political culture itself, a way of forbidden communication, "a poetical
slang."

To give an example, when I first translated the Turkish poet Ece Ayhan's "A
Blind Cat Black and Orthodoxies" in around 1982, the knee jerk reaction to it
was that it was another "surrealist" poem. Surrealism was part of the main
stream avant garde at the time, and most Western readers saw the image and
syntactical elisions of Ece Ayhan's work as a backwater surrealist attempt,
in other words, in their own image. When the book came out in 1997, because
of the prose shape of the individual pieces, there was an attempt to connect
it to Rimbaud.

In fact, neither of these two approaches is revealing or correct. Ece Ayhan's
work in these two poems is built on a dialectic between reavealing and
hiding, saying the forbidden (often of a sexual content) and defending
against its consequences. When Ece Ayhan distorts syntax, elides crucial
connections or uses slang known only to sub-cultures, he is trying to reveal
something and also maintain "deniability" - come to think of it, not that
different in purpose from Bin Ladin's attempt to claim credit for the havoc
in New York and previous places and at the same time maintain he was not
involved.

The title of my piece was, "Takes or Mis-takes from the Revolutionary Poetry
Symposium, The Poetry Project, May 5-8, 1994." It was included in the CD-Rom
issue of "Little Magazine" on visual poetry. It may still be lurking
somewhere in the web.

   ABOUT differences

differences: a Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies is edited by Naomi
Schor, Elizabeth Weed, and Ellen Rooney. It is a publication of the
Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women at Brown University.

Because this is the first issue in the journal's history to focus
substantially on poetic practice, I would be interested to hear, however
quickly and informally, from any Poetics List members who are not regular
readers of the journal but who plan to consult or purchase this issue
because of its specific focus on contemporary poetry. Please respond to
sender's address above, *not* to Poetics.

Individual issues can be purchased at good bookstores or directly from
Indiana University Press at http://iupjournals.org/differences/ (scroll
down to the "Special Single Issues" category).


   FROM THE INTRODUCTION

The terms most centrally at stake in this special issue of
differences-contemporary poetry, feminism, avant-gardism,
poststructuralism-do not settle easily into any stable constellation with
one another, and that is precisely why they have been chosen. The
absorbingly complex and embattled practices these terms designate, the
discrepant commitments and discrete historical trajectories each evokes,
are treated in these pages as though they were _all and simultaneously_ of
consequence to one another. The gesture is counterintuitive, perhaps, but
the pitfalls of considering these practices in isolation, or even in pairs,
are familiar enough to warrant it. We know very well, for instance, that
discussions of avant-garde poetry can carry on for entire generations
without ever seriously confronting the question of gender; we know also
that poststructuralist theory can sustain a decades long debate about
feminine poetics while seldom betraying more than a vague awareness of the
actual shapes assumed by contemporary poetic practice; and we know as well
how the feminist poetry that has been institutionalized within women's
studies programs and teaching anthologies can be restrictively organized
around a normative concept of "experience" that renders all but the most
tentative formal innovations by women inadmissible and anathematizes
theoretical reflection on poetic practice (by poets themselves, by their
readers) as an overly intellectualized interference with the immediate
pleasures afforded by cathartic identification. An avant-garde without
women, a poetics without poetry, a poetry for which entire registers of
experience, innovation, and reflexivity are taboo: such are the results of
failing to hold, in however tense an engagement, the necessary terms of the
complex equation examined in this issue.

What "movement"? What "response"? What "credibility" ? Who are you pointing
a finger at as "pussyfooting" around"? Who are the "reframers"?

Weren't we silenced before we even began to speak. "Surrendering
credibility"? Who, besides the 800 people involved this discussion group,
gives a damn what we say? Get real, we're just talking to ourselves, sorting
things out & using the collective self called "UB Poetics discussion group"
as the sounding board for an otherwise ineffectual conscience. Things as
they are not as we would like them to be.

The Writers Forum workshop met on Saturday 22 September 2001. This was the
second workshop of the season. I can't tell you about the first as I was out
of London then.

Amongst other things, there were launch performances of two publications
from WF - _duets_ (40 images) and _mutate / cantate_ (13 images), both
polychrome visual texts made collaboratively by Bob Cobbing and Lawrence
Upton, printed on cards, in commercially-produced folders

For the launch the texts were uttered, gestured and danced by Cobbing, Upton
& Jennifer Pike

_mutate / cantate_ was Cobbing and Upton's second polychrome collaboration
[the first is _Fuming_, also from WF], made using collage and manipulation
of black and white and colour photocopiers, the images built up element by
element and colour by colour on a single colour (i.e. one colour cartridge
at a time) single sheet photocopier

_duets_ started out as a solo work by Lawrence Upton, a set of
computer-generated black and white images to be used as colour separations
in polychrome images, which Cobbing then worked upon, overlaying
non-matching images, deliberately misaligning them etc

in the nature of the technology used (a colour copier human beings can
afford) the colours of the final published prints differ somewhat from the
originals; and it is hoped to exhibit the originals and to web-publish them
in due course

Unfortunately these are relatively expensive activities.

_mutate / cantate_ is available in UK at £25 plus p & p

_duets_ is available in UK at £35 plus p & p

The next WF workshop is in 2 weeks on Saturday 6 October 2001 3.30 for 4 at
Betsey Trotwood, Farringdon Rd, London E C 1 all who sympathetic are welcome

This seems true to me. I'd go a bit further, however, and say that the
Internet has wiped out the notion of generations. On this list, for example,
as on most, the number of years one has, or hasn't, lived is not relevant.
This is refreshing. We all learn from each other.

I was seeing all those Nazi flags goose-stepping along as I read the above.
Like the "USA! USA!" cheers at the Olympics, which I found embarrassing. By
the way, isn't there is an Olympics in Utah in a few months? I shutter to
think of the security problems.

Maybe lost innocence? However, Americans have a propensity to hang on to
their illusions about themselves. All people do, until the bitter end.

What bothers me is that I got the same sinking feeling I had during the
Vietnam War, the one that tells me we can't win this one for the Giffer.
That we're on a disasterous course.
What I heard in Bush's speech was, "We're the greatest," and, "You better do
what we want, or else." If he had also said, "I understand that there are
people who hate us, and with some reason. We've made mistakes. We must learn
to be more tolerant of other societies, and of each other," I'd wave a flag
too.

I would like to thank Barrett Watten for taking the trouble to answer Ron
Silliman's post at such length, and with such care.  I have been too busy
with my non-List life to respond to anything on any e-mail list with such
attention and such care.  I say this with regret.

However, I have also come to realize that I have in fact benefitted from this
List's responses to the WTC and Pentagon attacks, both from the personal
accounts that people have sent in, to the attempts at critical response to
the Bush 'crusade' rhetoric, the flag-waving and the semiotics of the flag,
etc.  I personally have greatly valued the efforts of those who have
forwarded messages and URL's that throw some informed light on these events
that have so unnerved us all.  And because of all of these things that the
List has given to me, I have come to feel a certain debt, and a
responsibility, to try to make some contribution of my own to this community
to which, I now know, I gratefully belong.

To tell the truth, though, I was greatly annoyed with Ron Silliman's post.
Of course, some of the Leftist rhetoric that we have heard on this as well as
other lists is tired and ineffectual.  But the fact that the Left is not
heard in the US, it seems obvious to me, is not the result of its
inadequacies, as much as it is the result of the fact that the culture of the
US [not America, as George Bowering rightly observes] is intransigently
Right-wing, eternally xenophobic, grossly ignorant, and blissfully
self-involved [and this explains why GW Bush earns 90 % approval ratings
these days: he is a perfect representative of his constituency].  Even on
this List of reasonably well-informed people, there are many who still cannot
tell the difference between a Sikh and a Muslim -- and so the shooting of the
one in the place of the other is -- well, let's just call it collateral
damage.

To be brief and personal: I myself am not inclined to compromise in any way
watsoever with the anguished bloodlust of my neighbors in this town where I
live, or in the national media, or on this List.  I don't care what the US
public demands of its spineless politicians [I do not see any leaders among
them, none whatsoever].  Nothing justifies the infliction of still more
atrocities on still more innocent victims, i.e., innocent bystanders.  In
fact, the US military CANNOT POSSIBLY attack the terrorists who committed the
awful atrocities that have become such major, prize-winning, media events --
without also attacking countless numbers of innocent bystanders.  We are
being coaxed by vicious idiots into thinking that 'collateral damage'  is
perfectly acceptable when it comes to Afghanis -- but in fact that is what
those terrorists thought of their victims on those hijacked airplanes and in
the WTC towers -- they were innocent, but unfortunately necessary,
"collateral damage."  If the US goes into Afghanistan or Iraq with the same
attitude that the terrorists took with their own bodies into the WTC towers,
it is no better than the ghastly, inhuman terrorists who assaulted all of
human feeling and morality in their attacks of Sept 11, 2001.

As for all of the current flag-waving, I detest it, no matter what the
feelings that inspire it.  The flag is not a transitional object.  It is a
clear-cut unambiguous sign of the crudest sort of nationalism that we should
all reject.  I don't know about Ron Silliman or the rest of you, but as for
me, compassion does not flow only toward my neighbors, indeed my friends and
relatives in NYC.  No, it runs in all directions, infinnitely, to Arabs,
Palestinians, all Muslims as well as all Christians and Jews, never mind the
majority of the rest of the species.  It extends in fact to all sentient
beings, in fact [I read Buddhist texts in Pali and in Sanskrit, and I take my
reading very seriously].  To me it is unforgivable that we can tolerate
brutality against so many, of so many races and so many ethnicities,  so many
animals of all sorts.  The rest of the world has had to live with US
terrorism for decades.  Now we must live with this terrorism too.  It is
awful for all of us. Awful.  For every single one of us, among whom I include
Iraqis and Afghanis, Algerians and Saudis, et al.  Sorry, I do not recognize
national borders when it comes to my capacity for compassion.

If we all detest the religous fundamentalism of the Taliban, as we should, we
should also detest the same thing among our so-called leaders, and their
leaders, among whom are to be counted the vapid likes of Jerry Falwell and
Pat Robertson.

Our enemies come in many shapes and sizes and ethniciities, and as far as I
can tell, they are all situated to my right, and they are all nationalists.
The left is not the problem.

Dear listees,

I've enjoyed reading the different responses that folks have had to the Trade
Center tragedy. I'd imagine that most of you are at semester schools, and
many of those in New York. I teach in California, at CSU Hayward, on a
quarter system. As such, we haven't started up yet. This coming quarter I'll
teach "Rhetoric and Argument," "Basic Composition" and maybe a poetry
workshop. I'm wondering if some of you teach, and if some of you, like me,
teach basic grunt classes with a lot of young students. I'm wondering how/if
y'all have begun to talk about in your classes the current political
situation. At CSU Hayward I last week called a meeting of my fellow adjunct
composition teachers, some of whom attended. We began to talk about ways to
approach this whole mess in the class room, but we didn't really get all that
far. We have one more meeting before school starts up, so I'm wondering if
y'all might have any ideas (since many of you, I'd guess, find yourselves in
the thick of it). I've looked at a number of interesting sites:
<<http://rucus.ru.ac.za/~urban/docs/baloney.html>>, <<www.mideasti.org>> and
a good many others. But I'm more interested in hearing your first-hand
experiences. How's it going in the class? What are students saying? How are
you responding?, etc.

If anyone's interested, let's start a thread. Or else, if this topic is too
off the mark of the subject of Poetics, I'd enjoy emails off-list
<<marott@aol.com>>.

Best,

A Word On Language In A Time Of Crisis

    It is the nature of both history and language that they are bound by a
principle of change.  =B3Things change=B2 might be the most adequate statement
of a philosophy of history I can think of.  Historical change in language
generally happens very slowly.  Meanings evolve through slight variations i=
n
word usage over time.  However, in the wake of =B3The Events of September
11th=B2, many commonplace words, through their media-enhanced association wit=
h
a single image fraught with the grief and suffering of so many, seem to hav=
e
had their meanings changed over night.
    Before =B3The Events of September 11th,=B2 a =B3skyscraper=B2 was, =B3a very tall
building=B2; an =B3airplane=B2 was, =B3an aircraft kept aloft by the aerodynamic
forces upon its wings and driven forward by a screw propeller or by other
means, as jet propulsion=B2; and a =B3collapse=B2 was, =B3a falling in or together,
as the sides of a hollow vessel.=B2  Now, the definition of =B3skyscraper=B2 must
include, =B3a tall, symbolic and functional structure, vulnerable to highly
coordinated terrorist attack=B2;  =B3airplane=B2, =B3extremely lethal airborne
explosive device=B2; and =B3collapse,=B2 =B3collateral damage to financial
infrastructures and markets caused by unexpected terrorist attacks.=B2 I doub=
t
anyone will ever again be able to watch an =B3airplane=B2 fly behind a
=B3skyscraper=B2 without remembering the =B3collapse.=B2  And not without a certain
amount of anxiety, either.
    Before =B3The Events of September 11th,=B2 a cell-phone was =B3a hand-held or
mobile radio-telephone providing access to a cellular radio network.=B2  Now
it is an =B3emergency communications device used under highly dangerous
circumstances, such as hijackings and explosions, to report locations of
victims, logistics of attacks and, in certain irreversible situations, fina=
l
messages to loved ones.=B2 As of this writing, the only definition for the
word =B3box-cutter=B2 I have been able to find is buried in the OED:  =B3A person
employed in cutting out the material for boxes.=B2  I can find no definition
that refers to =B3a tool with a sliding, retractable razor used for cutting
boxes.=B2  It feels a little late for that definition now, because it too mus=
t
be modified with the addendum =B3or for sneaking past underpaid, poorly
trained airport security personnel to launch a suicide attack on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon, cf. =8CThe Events of September 11th.=B9=B2
    When we say that the meanings of these words have changed, I think we
are really saying that the context in which we use these words has changed,
which modifies the possibilities for their usage.  Over time, this can
result in a change in their meaning, but at present it constitutes only an
alteration in their use.  Gertrude Stein said, =B3Nothing makes a difference =
a
difference in beginning and in the middle and in ending except that each
generation has something different at which they are looking.=B2  What has
changed is what we are looking at, and what we are looking at is that.  We
are looking at the repeated image of the airplane crashing into the
skyscraper.  We are looking at the skyscraper and the stock market collapse=
.
We are looking at a world that is no longer constituted by 180 nations
competing with a single superpower for control of the global market, but
rather by a division between Western democratic nations and a network of
semi-autonomous cells of well-funded terrorists intent on killing innocent
civilians, even at the cost of their own lives.  We are looking at the
possibility of the curbing of civil liberties, of decreased privacy, of
increased security, and in a worst-case scenario of Spartan discipline
brought to bear on civilian life in a long, hard, painful, costly war.  We
are, it seems, =B3united=B2 in our attention to that image.
    What concerns me about this is not whether or not our declaration of =B3a
new kind of war=B2 against a =B3nameless, faceless=B2 enemy is just.  I think it
is.  I think that Al Qaeda and the Taliban =AD any armed religious fanatics
for that matter =AD jeopardize the stability of the entire world.  What
concerns me is the ease with which we are allowing certain other aspects of
the language to change, which change can have serious long-term consequence=
s
for the way we understand them and our government in the future. Very
disconcerting is the use of words like =B3god=B2 and =B3prayer=B2 in any kind of
governmental communication including, and especially, presidential
addresses.  Since =B3The Events of September 11th,=B2 the president has felt no
qualms about associating the mourning process with religious ceremony,
retaliation with Christian morality, and grieving with prayer, all under th=
e
aegis of =B3compassionate government in a time of crisis.=B2
    It is the linguistic and institutional =B3separation of church and state=B2
which keeps this country from teetering off the already precarious cliff of
Christian fundamentalism into the abyss of religious fanaticism that
envelops the members of so many of these terrorist networks.  To use this
event to promote, implicitly or explicitly, the federalization of religious
sentiment in America is to risk committing the same crime as the Taliban.
This may be a =B3just=B2 war, but it is not a =B3holy=B2 one.  This =B3war=B2 is not
about defending Christian values; it is about defending the citizens of
democratic nations from the threat of terrorist attacks.  If history teache=
s
us anything about language, it is that it doesn=B9t take a thousand years to
change the meaning of =B3God is with us in our time of national mourning=B2 to
=B3God is on our side.=B2  It can happen over night.

In regard to my last response to this: the fact is hat if I look at what has
occurred, and ask my self.... would I ever be so anti capitalist or anti
anything to fly an aeroplane through a building? Would I prefer to be a
crazy Muslim and do away with what IS great about Western civilisation? My
answer would be no. Never. Today  woke up and I tried to remember the events
on TV (they seem to me to be just that) and there's a strange air of
irreality about them.
  With all the suppposed "aggressiveness" of the US (and I dont know if
Bush's response is going to do ant good) .... I dont know.
  There is - as the old saying  goes - no rhyme or reason. I think we are
all spinning hopelessly toward a total annihilation when we will be free of
torment. Richard.

Dear Charles,

First of all, thank you so much for your postings at the poetics list -
they, together with all the discussion going on there, have done a great
job in making "all this", well, both heavier and lighter, to me.

Somehow, it hasn't been that simple to assume the "brave" stance of the
New Yorkers reported from hour to hour on TV.

I've really been very down, mentally, this whole week. Feeling deprived
of the meaning (or the meaning of meaning) in just about everything.
Growing more and more addicted to the CNN... Not depressed, but utterly
confused, disappointed to so many things, species, ideas, movements,
perspectives, persons - myself (and yes, certain amount of what's been
going on the list, also) included.

Terrified, I almost forgot to say. Horrified to the point of wanting to
vomit.

Sad. And angry. And angry at having to think it over and over again,
inside my own head, as I'm going to do here...

Actually it's kind of strange, that I, who, as you know, do not consider
myself that much of a leftist nowadays, should have come think of the
"all this" so predominantly from a leftist perspective.

This is one of the things that have been haunting me: among so much and
so seemingly spontaneous talk about the "responsibility" of  "us" -
"the West", "the America" - to "this", i.e. about certain
"justification" for what those 19 well-shaven men did,  I'm still to
hear the question on the *lefts own* responsibility, in that case.

I mean: if there's a - smallest - justification... what in that case
about the responsibility of all (us) who have, in different contexts,
been preaching about the necessity to "strike" the "system", to "blow it
up", to "hit the enemy" at its weakest, i.e. most vulnerable, i.e.
sometimes seemingly strongest point ...

The attacks have bin Ladens "signature", they say. Well, they also have
the signature of all urgings to strike, to throw out, to hit, to reveal
... They are all about that rhetoric finally gone abominably awry. What
have *we* done to prevent that happening? What will we do to prevent it
happening again?

As I wrote in one of my earliest notes to "this":

I think I have seen the eyes that have seen the eyes of Osama bin Laden.
My hand
was helping
to lift the hand that
rose to point to the
target.

Well, maybe that connects to one of the oldest problems of the left:
maybe there never really were that many actual leftists at all - just
followers after followers believing others being the real leftists...

I've become to think pretty much along the lines suggested by Tamir
Ansary (quoted in the post by Alan Sondheim, September 15...), and I
almost  fully agree with Ron Silliman in his excellent analysis of the
"lefts" dilemmas today.

To me, it's spurious to compare, and weigh against each others, the
attacks on the Towers, and, say, the Clinton bombings in Sudan, when
clearly both, ultimately, result from the same plan. It's sad, and
embarrassing, to see a mind like Noam Chomsky's to fall into that
trap...

Yes, the Nazis keep coming to mind. Yet I believe the enemy, or time, or
the stakes, are worse than that this time around. Much worse.

That's one of the saddening things: that it's so open, to everyone, to
see what is at stake - the whole of the civilization, the modernization,
the idea of (any kind of) progress, human dignity and rights, literacy,
freedom to speech, to gender, to be even... and yet, truly, it doesn't
seem to hit home.

So, is there, behind all the talk about the culpability of the
Americans, of the "we" or the "they" getting what they've been asking
for, a more deep-going indifference towards the civilization as such?

Which, then, may not deserve to be defended that strongly?

No, of course I don't think that way. As an old leftist, I keep thinking
about the Front Populaire against Nazism - how long it took to build up
(they tell). The enormous amount of prejudices (and hair-splitting about
the "real" or "ultimate" "responsibility" of "ruling classes", on the
left, and the "reality" of the danger, on both sides) to be left behind
before the democrats, right and left, in France,then in the whole
Europe, later on the world scale in the WW2 could join forces - to what
still is the most spectacular, if not only, permanent result of all the
left's struggles - the victory over Nazism.

"Do you think this is going to lead to the World War Three", Kirsi asked
me during the first hours.  "No", I reassured her, "this *is* it." I
still think that way. I'm afraid I sound a little less reassured day by
day...

Yes: I do think it's a war. True, every time Bush (the-son-of-a-Bush)
walks to the screen, I feel embarrassed about his "Dad, look, I've got
my own war here now" vein of putting things. Still: he is the elected
leader of the leading nation of the civilized world that's under an
extremely dangerous attack. There's no way around it, nor need there be.
He is my commander-in-chief in this. Period.

Besides, much of what many representatives of "the Bush administration"
are saying makes perfect sense to me. The idea of a "new kind of war" in
many ways  echoes what we are used to hear from the "progressive"
security policy experts: how the real threats have ceased to be nation
states, armies, bombs - being poisons, environment, weather, and
terrorism instead.

Yes, I too am concerned about the perspective of premature efforts at
seizing "the prime suspect", not to speak about bombing Afghanistan. But
not because we supposedly lack evidence on the man (his interviews alone
would suffice...).

On the contrary: because that might compromise the longer perspective,
shroud from view the necessity to wage a *really* long term ... hmmm ...
battle.

Which will involve new ways of attack, but new modes of defence also.

This is the most important, and to my view, the most neglected point
here. That we are under an absolute necessity to defence ourselves, and
that we can do that by (cannot do that without) *changing our society*,
our civilization, our way of life - which haven't necessarily be to the
worse.

That among this tremendous sadness, there are glints of an enormous hope
- of people getting together, starting to do something together, to some
of the most important issues determining the future of the planet, of
all us.

That, for these reasons also, the left needs be involved in the defence,
not critizising it from outside.

Yes, I believe it's time to dig the good old Gandhi out from beneath the
rubble of cold and other wars - and start thinking how the doctrine of
passive resistance might be applied in this new war.

To prevent the next strike, which I too fear may well involve biological
and/or nuclear components.

To take new, decisive steps towards further disarmament, nuclear and
otherwise.

Now, when the need for these kinds of measures, for once, is so evident
to everybody.

But nothing on these lines can be done, if we refuse to accept the
common cause - the need to preserve the humanity, the civilization.

In the final analysis (as we used to say), the problem is not about
seeing and acknowledging the enemy (although this is important too) -
it's about our willingness to come together...

There  will be societal changes, whether we want them or not. Not all of
them will have any bearing on democracy and freedom - like tightening
the security on airplanes (ok), fewer flights (well, so nice you were
here already... and we *do* plan to come over during the Autumn...).
Others will be more problematic...

What I'm specifically interested in is the now almost inevitable
perspective of "more documented life" (Bill Gates (!)) - fraught with
dangers, of course, but also containing seeds to something new,
including the idea of everybody as publisher - which of course is
already manifested, in a rudimental form, in the present day Internet...

Which may well be one of the main lines of defence...

...After all... it was build to fight terrorism... by the US military...

None of these and other things can be done overnight, and none without
the ingenuity, the innovativeness...

...of the people?

...of America?

...of the left?

...of the poetry?

Well, in my first notes, again, I also wrote about "nothing, the least
the poetry, being the same / any more".

(I also wrote: "Ich bin (sic) ein Amerikaner jetzt...")

And, in a mock-brechtian note: "What a time! When / talk about the
meaning of meaning is almost crime, in the face / of this meaningless /
crime so  / full of meaning..."

As you know, I had made the decision not to write in Finnish any more,
and was wondering whether I could start learning to write in English
instead.

Now, there seemed to be a double impossibility to write (and I was also
frustrated by the futility of the question as such: what difference
would it make in which language I decide to fall silent (this one also
coming from Brecht...)

To be honest, this was one of the reasons to be angry to "the
perpetrators": what right did they have to come and muddle the quiet
waters of my self-complacent post-leftist life of mulling about the
value of language and poetry ...

Of having interesting conversations on the meaning of meaning.

The word *interesting* seeming to be impossible to use any more.

Then I remembered how I spent the night before the strike  -  i.e.
translating some of my dadaistic sonnets into English.

Here's one draft, translated, in ways, back, not to, but towards,  the
73rd sonnet of Shakespeare, from which the Finnish "original" ("Joko Ono
Mato") was a pseudo-homophonic version:

John Winston Worm

that time. Of year. No roots. No rats
o yellow leaves, o run, or few do hang
upon these boughs... So what? Against the odds
"bare-ruined-choirs". Muchos Grazias. The bats

in me this mean, this twilight, nights
as after sunset. Poising in west
by and by black night. Japanese tights
death's second shell. Salsa in the rest

my fatal past-time, glowing of such halo
on the ashes as of this youth: then die
then death-bed, the here in Borsalino

consumed by taxi. Amen. Hand nourished by
what thou perceivest, so make thy love more strong
to love that well, which thou must leave ere long

To me, at least, incredibly in ways, this humble draft speaks rather
straightforwardly about what has happened, since.

As it should.

As all poetry ("even my poetry") should?

And what about this other draft, where the remote origins are a stanza
in Pushkin's Yevgeni Onegin (the one with the shot) and the Helsinki
tabloid's on the Versaci murder in summer 1997:

Paparazzi. Now (Onegin One)

Pressing at chest the new hand now
he wonders: who. Ash in his expression
gets unseen - masks to borrow,
for each to allow own, to give the cushion.

A number of steeps he downwards stoops
routinely frothing - frolicking,
with many a wealthy client shivering.
Turnkeys get turned. We see the licking.

Escaping arrived here three days past:
now is no more! To a miamibeachian
cast of eternity has over-gone,

and oops! full blossom of the vibes now knows
the one, who at stages used to shine,
to cross, to over-trot, to bet, behave.

This could be offered as a contorted mirror of, and for, what happened -
including all this rummaging about the responsibility, the who did what,
the implications, ways to act against, the dangers of getting divided,
ways to come together...

Maybe the poetry, for one, need *not* change, after all. Maybe *that's*
the way for poetry to change, now as always.

Maybe that's the way it already *did* change.

As it should?

In any case, I'm sure that poetry, understood as working with mysteries,
uncertainties, and, yes, that which does not have a meaning, voice,
words, yet, is crucially important at these kind of times when people
need to think "all over again".

Of course, it's only poetry. Poetry never was the whole life. But in a
way it is all about resistance - and very often passive at that...

Well, and at least writing this has been an enormous relief to me.

I wrote it to you. I couldn't bring myself to write to the list - it
didn't seem appropriate, in a way, yet. I wanted address someone I
know... but of course you are free to circulate this, in any ways you
might find advisable.

And it would be interesting to hear what you think about some of the
things I said.

Hey, there's the word - *interesting*.

I'm moving on.

We are going to make it.

We are going to survive.

Love,

Leevi

In july a friend sent this writing on to me and I was supposed to send =
it on to you...sorry its so late, but given the recent events it seems =
calling up Allen Ginsberg spirit couldn't hurt.

NECROPOLIS X

" . . . it is understood that in this Kali Yuga age

of destruction breath, meditation, mind, intelligence and works

are hopeless to raise the soul out of its materialist mire - only

sheer joy will save us."

A.G.





Allen Ginsberg pilots the White House through a cloud of rioting squid. =
These creatures seldom put up with elements let alone the Grand Master =
of Common Sense. Poets flying unknown flags remember occasional dead =
presidents but not on the job. Why just the other decade I was smoking =
out a few visionary bison with some Arkansas nerve gas. Better known as =
dream killer, young quivering attention having migrated over to the =
cooler where some Necropolian lawyers are drinking distilled Watergate =
piss. I was smoking out a few homogenous Clintons just as Allen burst =
through the door announcing his death in alchemized words, sitting zazen =
on a cloud just over Katmandu. The raindrops falling on his ashes were =
speaking in tongues. Rimbaud was taking dictation. The Pacific Ocean =
writes back in squid ink

Allen Ginsberg pilots the White House through a range of lost breath, =
pausing at the corner of Broadway and Columbus, circa 1975. About 2 AM. =
You afraid of me, boy? Breathe, breathe! Put it out there, kick this =
broken glass, write about these dog turds. I don't believe in =
surrealism. But yeah I love Philip Lamantia. Breathe, breathe

The White House falls into a stormy conservation camp, the whole place =
looks like Central Park on laughing gas. Ginsberg lowers the flag. Nixon =
tailgates, yelling slogans. Mao smiles in the background, selling =
postcards of the obedient Sphinx. Never mutter about the forms that =
shackle. Shout instead. Have Naked Lunch on the White House lawn. I =
drool when I read Howl. Gregory Corso shoots up the Indian Ocean, =
collapsed veins resurface in the Dead Sea. You leave India through =
unknown incarnations of Buddha and arrive right here on Columbus time. =
Kali Yuga=20

Allen pilots the presidential palace between the house and senate like =
an open grave, indignant of the talking dead. The electoral collge =
multiplies. You are it and have planned it all the while these millions =
of incarnations and deserve it like a true bastard. God's name stamped =
on your heavy luggage. I never want to go to bed, I never want to die =
printed in the margin

The riot is taking place on the other side of the rainbow, just as a =
hole opens in a killer nation's brain, more peaceful than stars seen =
after a hurricane. The Washington Monument takes off, a spearhead with =
god knows what Christ at the controls. It is going up some decadent =
Holstein's one-legged Yuga, call Bovine Brothers and Sister's Anonymous. =
I ended up in jail because God wouldn't listen to a poem

Alien Allen cuts himself a piece of Florida and sits down in a =
thunderstorm in Ohio. No, it's Oahu. Hunter Thompson is there =
administrating last rites as Tim Leary purrs in on his coping jet, =
having found a can of psychoactive anti-squid spray, guaranteed to cool =
the coolest of rioting surrealists.  However Spiral Agnew has written in =
a margin of the Everglades that fear and loathing can never leave you, =
love and liberty follow suit

The Statue of Liberty has been torn down and Allen is poised there hands =
up to the Apocalypse like he's hailing a cab. It could be Hale-Bopp, it =
could be the mothership full of spirit boys. But where are their =
genitals? Maybe they are girls this incarnation. Maybe the women lopped =
them off to keep the men from going to war. There's a pretty big grave =
of genitals somewhere in this Necropolis and we better find it before =
the giant squid do. Until then just be reassured Allen has won the Mr. =
Universe Contest. Breathe, man, breathe out. Here he comes through the =
broken whole of our holiness, the Dali Mama. Breathe, baby, breathe out, =
lest the giant squid prevail. Ancient Allen rests his case






Mary,=20
Thanks for the Treadwell/Ginsberg inspiration. I needed it. Enclosed (I =
guess above, this computer or serving party is always messing with me) =
is some bardic stuff of my own based on an old acid trip. Amazing how =
much mileage you can get off a little pill. Rod was just here visiting. =
We talked incessantly, doing aquatic things also.=20
Best, Ken

   My father died last night shortly after seven. There are I know many on
the list
   who know his work and who will be saddened by his death.

   He didn't suffer. A cold that had gone to his chest on Saturday was a
concern
   and he went to hospital. By the end of the day and a range of tests all
seemed well
   but he was to stay there for a day or two under observation. After dinner
last night
   his heart stopped all of a sudden.

   He turned 90 this year. His last book, The Bells of St Babels, Auckland
University Press,
   came out earlier this year and won the Montana Prize for Poetry. The
Carcanet edition
   will be published this week. He had given quite a few readings this year,
the last being
   a week ago in Auckland. Just before that he was in the studio recording a
three hours selection
   of  his work  for the BBC archives. As all this suggests, he surrendered
very little to age
   before it ran out of patience with him.

   Long live poetry!

   Wystan.

hi tom

>>I'm not clear how anti-fundamentalism de-programming could be
questionable?<<

i hesitate proposing any sort of psych method because i know so little about
it & certainly don't know the possible negative ramifications. perhaps it
could cause a backlash or be used to nurture yet another cult/religious
group with the same negative potential. and so on. & of course the moral
dilemma of tinkering with another's mind with 'righteous' intent, given the
relative nature of 'truth,' 'help,'  etc...

This is pretty neat....

Read this and recall why we call him/her "Captain."  The following is from a
letter by a professional and her return flight to D.C. this week.

"I just wanted to drop you all a note and let you know that I arrived safe
and sound into Dulles Airport tonight [9/15] at about 6:00. It was an
interesting flight.

The airport in Denver was almost spooky, it was so empty and quiet. No one
was in line for the security check point when I got there so that went
fairly quickly, just x-ray of my bags and then a chemical test to be sure
nothing explosive was on them.

Then I waited 2 * hours to board the plane. What happened after we boarded
was interesting and thought I would share it with you. The pilot/captain
came on the loudspeaker after the doors were closed. His speech went like
this:

First I want to thank you for being brave enough to fly today. The doors are
now closed and we have no help from the outside for any problems that might
occur inside this plane. As you could tell when you checked in, the
government has made some changes to increase security in the airports.

They have not, however, made any rules about what happens after those doors
close. Until they do that, we have made our own rules and I want to share
them with you. Once those doors close, we only have each other.  The
security has taken care of a threat like guns with all of the increased
scanning, etc. Then we have the supposed bomb. If you have a bomb, there is
no need to tell me about it, or anyone else on this plane; you are already
in control.  So, for this flight, there are no bombs that exist on this
plane.

Now, the threats that are left are things like plastics, wood, knives, and
other weapons that can be made or things like that which can be used as
weapons.

Here is our plan and our rules. If someone or several people stand up and
say they are hijacking this plane, I want you all to stand up together. Then
take whatever you have available to you and throw it at them. Throw it at
their faces and heads so they will have to raise their hands to protect
themselves.

The very best protection you have against knives are the pillows and
blankets. Whoever is close to these people should then try to get a blanket
over their head-then they won't be able to see. Once that is done, get them
down and  keep them there. Do not let them up. I will then land the plane at
the closest place and we WILL take care of them.

After all, there are usually only a few of them and we are 200+ strong! We
will not allow them to take over this plane.

I find it interesting that the US Constitution begins with the words "We,
the people"-that's who we are, THE people and we will not be defeated.

With that, the passengers on the plane all began to applaud, people had
tears in their eyes, and we began the trip toward the runway.

The flight attendant then began the safety speech. One of the things she
said is that we are all so busy and live our lives at such a fast pace. She
asked that everyone turn to their neighbors on either side and introduce
themselves, tell each other something about your families and children, show
pictures, whatever.  She said "for today, we consider you family. We will
treat you as  such and ask that you do the same with us."  Throughout the
flight we learned that for the crew, this was their first  flight since
Tuesday's tragedies. It was a day that everyone leaned on each other and
together everyone was stronger than any one person alone.  It was quite an
experience.

I've been working on my crisis page, and these are the results so far:

www.english.wayne.edu/~watten/crisis

Obviously there is only so much one can do with the vast amount of
information flooding in at the moment. Building a page like this may simply
be one way to deal with it. I'm trying to be useful and representative,
within my limits. There's obviously much to be done with the bibliography
of poetry and war. I assume that linking reports, poems, discussion, and
other material from the Listserv is OK with those linked, but if you have
any reservation about it let me know.

I'm interested particularly in more links to "aesthetic" response. What is
that? Could be, but not necessarily, a topical poem. It could be a quirky
detail or link to visual information. For instance, I found Michael
Gottlieb's note on WCW's fire engine to be the kind of "aesthetic" detail
that I would like to find more of. Ditto Muffy Bolding's forward of a url
to that horrific album cover. Ditto mez's web page, where her current poems
are displayed, and George Hartley's "Saturation Bombing."

You asked about URLs for Colin Powell's statements to the press. They're all
on this site below:

It's a page of unedited transcriptions--if that's what you want--but doesn't

Dear Friends:

In light of events happening around the world, poetry is even more import=
ant
in our lives.  As many of you know, we had over 180 readings in over 150
cities around the world during the last week in March 2001 to celebrate
the UN's Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations Through Poetry. We are atte=
mpting
to do it again from 17 March to 24 March 2002.  The theme is:
"Can poetry build a culture of peace and non-violence in the world?"

We would like your support and help by either:
1. setting up a reading in your town or city to focus on the theme.

2. If an editor or publisher, run our ads located at
http://www.dialoguepoetry.org/un_exchange_ads.htm

If interested or have questions, please email Larry Jaffe at jaffe@dialog=
uepoetry.org
or visit our site at http://www.dialoguepoetry.org

Thank You,
Ram Devineni
Program Coordinator

I think Iser makes a good case for the fictive as a 'transitional" =
object on the way to aprehending the imagianry in his _The fictive and =
the Imaginary_ It does seem to me that analoguously this works as the =
'poetic' of poetry or visual poetry as a t.o. on the way to the =
imaginary. Since I'm far from being an academic and far from academic =
resources, I would appreciate thoughts, references on this.

KLA Finances War With Heroin

KLA rebels train in terrorist camps
By Jerry Seper
The Washington Times, May 4, 1999

"Some members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has financed its war
effort through the sale of heroin, were trained in terrorist camps run by
international fugitive Osama bin Laden....
The KLA members, embraced by the Clinton administration in NATO's 41-day
bombing campaign to bring Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to the
bargaining table, were trained in secret camps in Afghanistan,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and elsewhere, according to newly obtained intelligence
reports. The reports also show that the KLA has enlisted Islamic
terrorists -- members of the Mujahideen --as soldiers in its ongoing
conflict against Serbia, and that many already have been smuggled into
Kosovo to join the fight....
The KLA's involvement in drug smuggling as a means of raising funds for
weapons is long-standing. Intelligence documents show it has aligned itself
with an extensive organized crime network in Albania that smuggles heroin to
buyers throughout Western Europe and the United States."

A friend of mine shared the above articles with me after they came out on
the Post's website.  The Washington Post pulled these stories from their web
site within hours of posting them, with no retraction.  The stories just
vanished.  Does that sound Orwellian to you?

BALKAN - ALBANIA - KOSOVO - HEROIN - JIHAD
http://news.beograd.com/english/articles_and_opinion/balkan_peace_institute/
000620_balkan_albania_kosovo_heroin_jihad.html
In its report about the KLA and heroin smuggling, the Montreal Gazette
wrote: "...Michael Levine, a 25-year veteran of the DEA (US Drug Enforcement
Agency) who left in 1990, said he believes there is no question that US
intelligence knew about the KLA's drug ties. "They (the CIA) protected them
(the KLA) in every way they could. As long as the CIA is protecting the KLA,
you've got major drug pipelines protected from any police investigation",
said Levine, who teaches undercover tactics and informer handling to US and
Canadian police forces, including the RCMP. "The evidence is irrefutable,"
he said, explaining that his information comes from "sources inside the
DEA".

Michael Levine is the man 60 Minutes called "America's top undercover cop
for 25 years."

Kosovo 'Freedom Fighters' Financed by Organised Crime
By Michel Chossudovsky Department of Economics
University of Ottawa April 7, 1999
http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/kosovo23.htm
"Remember Oliver North and the Contras? The pattern in Kosovo is similar to
other CIA covert operations in Central America, Haiti and Afghanistan where
"freedom fighters" were financed through the laundering of drug money. Since
the onslaught of the Cold War, Western intelligence agencies have developed
a complex relationship to the illegal narcotics trade. In case after case,
drug money laundered in the international banking system has financed covert
operations."

You get rid of bin Laden, you're really just cutting him out of his part of

Laden . . . are they enemies, friends, or both?  "Um, maybe.  Dad?," Dumya
whispers behind the backside of an open upright palm.  The church music

I agree with Christopher Hitchens in general and with this article in
particular:

"What [Bin Laden & co.] abominate about 'the west', to put it in a phrase,
is not what western liberals don't like and can't defend about their own
system, but what they do like about it and must defend: its emancipated
women, its scientific inquiry, its separation of religion from the state.
Loose talk about chickens coming home to roost is the moral equivalent of
the hateful garbage emitted by Falwell and Robertson, and exhibits about the
same intellectual content."


Thanks, Marjorie.

>
> The Power of the Images
>
>
> As a metaphor analyst, I want to begin with the power of the images.
>
> There are a number of metaphors for buildings. We see features--eyes, nose
> and mouth--in their windows. The image of the plane going into South Tower
> of the World Trade Center is metaphorically an image of a bullet going
> through someone's head, the flame pouring from the other side blood
spurting
> out. Tall buildings are metaphorically people standing erect. Each tower
> falling was a body falling. We are not consciously aware of the
metaphorical
> images, but they are part of the power and the horror we experience when
we
> see them.
>
> Each of us, in the prefrontal cortex of our brains, has what are called
> "mirror neurons."  Such neurons fire either when we perform an action or
> when see the same action performed by someone else. There are connections
> from that part of the brain to the emotional centers. Such neural circuits
> are believed to be the basis of empathy.
>
> This works literally--when we see plane coming toward the building and
> imagine people in the building, we feel the plane coming toward us; when
we
> see the building toppling toward others, we feel the building toppling
> toward us. It also works metaphorically: If we see the plane going through
> the building, and unconsciously we metaphorize the building as a head with
> the plane going through its temple, then we sense--unconsciously but
> powerfully--being shot through the temple. If we metaphorize the building
as
> a person and see the building fall to the ground in pieces, then we
> sense--again unconsciously but powerfully--that we are falling to the
ground
> in pieces. Our systems of metaphorical thought, interacting with our
mirror
> neuron systems, turn external literal horrors into felt metaphorical
> horrors.
>
> Here are some other cases:
>
> Control Is Up: You have control over the situation, you're on top of
things.
> This has always been an important basis of towers as symbols of power. In
> this case, the toppling of the towers meant loss of control, loss of
power.
>
> Phallic imagery: Towers are symbols of phallic power and their collapse
> reinforces the idea of loss of power.
>
> Another kind of phallic imagery was more central here. The planes as
> penetrating the towers with a plume of heat.  The pentagon, a vaginal
image
> from the air, penetrated by the plane as missile.
>
> A Society Is A Building. A society can have a "foundation" which may or
may
> not be "solid" and it can "crumble" and "fall."  The World Trade Center
was
> symbolic of society. When it crumbled and fell, the threat was more than
to
> a building.
>
> We think metaphorically of things that perpetuate over time as "standing."
> Bush the Father in the Gulf War kept saying, "This will not stand,"
meaning
> that the situation would not be perpetuated over time. The World Trade
> Center was build to last ten thousand years. When it crumbled, it
> metaphorically raised the question of whether American power and American
> society would last.
>
> Building As Temple: Here we had the destruction of the temple of
capitalist
> commerce, which lies at the heart of our society.
>
>
> Our minds play tricks on us. The image of the Manhattan skyline is now
> unbalanced. We are used to seeing it with the towers there. Our mind
imposes
> our old image of the towers, and the sight of them gone gives one the
> illusion of imbalance, as if Manhattan we sinking. Given the symbolism of
> Manhattan as standing for the promise of America, it appears
metaphorically
> as if that promise were sinking.
>
> Then there is the persistent image, day after day, of the charred and
> smoking remains: it is an image of hell.
>
> The World Trade Center was a potent symbol, tied into our understanding of

> physically embodied in our brains. To incorporate the new knowledge
requires

>
> How The Administation Frames the Event
>
>
> The administration's framings and reframings and its search for metaphors
> should be noted. The initial framing was as a "crime" with "victims" and
> "perpetrators" to be "brought to justice" and "punished." The crime frame
> entails law, courts, lawyers, trials, sentencing, appeals, and so on. It
was
> hours before "crime" changed to "war" with "casualties," "enemies,"
> "military action," "war powers," and so on.
>
>
> Rumsfeld and other administration officials have pointed out that this
> situation does not fit our understanding of a "war."  There are "enemies"
> and "casualties" all right, but no enemy army, no regiments, no tanks, no
> ships, no air force, no battlefields, no strategic targets, and no clear
> "victory." The war frame just doesn't fit. Colin Powell had always argued
> that no troops should be committed without specific objectives, a clear
and
> achievable definition of victory, a clear exit strategy--and no open-ended
> commitments. But he has pointed out that none of these is present in this
> "war."
>
> Because the concept of "war" doesn't fit, there is a frantic search for
> metaphors. First, Bush called the terrorists "cowards"--but this didn't
> seem to work too well for martyrs who willing sacrificed their lives for
> their moral and religious ideals. More recently he has spoken of "smoking
> them out of their holes" as if they were rodents, and Rumsfeld has spoken
of
> "drying up the swamp they live in" as if they were snakes or lowly swamp
> creatures. The conceptual metaphors here are Moral is Up; Immoral is Down
> (they are lowly) and Immoral People are Animals (that live close to the
> ground).
>
> The use of the word "evil" in the administration's discourse works in the
> following way. In conservative, strict father morality (see my Moral
> Politics, Chapter 5), evil is a palpable thing, a force in the world. To
> stand up to evil you have to be morally strong. If you're weak, you let
evil
> triumph, so that weakness is a form of evil in itself, as is promoting

>
> Causes
>
>
> There are (at least) three kinds of causes radical Islamic terrorism:
>
> Worldview: The Religious Rationale
> Social and Political Conditions: Cultures of Despair
> Means: The Enabling Conditions
>
> The Bush administration has discussed only the third: The means that
enable
> attacks to be carried out. These include: Leadership (e.g., bin Laden),
host
> countries, training facilities and bases, financial backing, cell
> organization, information networks, and so on. These do not include the
> first and second on the list.
>
>
> Worldview: Religious Rationale
>
> The question that keeps being asked in the media is, Why do they hate us
so
> much?
>
> It is important at the outset to separate out moderate to liberal Islam
from
> radical Islamic fundamentalists, who do not represent most muslims.
>
> Radical Islamic fundamentalists hate our culture. They have a worldview
that
> is incompatible with the way that Americans--and other westerners--live
> their lives. One part of this world view concerns women, who are to hide
> their bodies, have no right to property, and so on. Western sexuality,
> mores, music, and women's equality all violate their values, and the
> ubiquity of American cultural products, like movies and music, throughout
> the world offends them.  A second part concerns theocracy: they believe
that
> governments should be run according to strict Islamic law by clerics. A
> third concerns holy sites, like those in Jerusalem, which they believe
> should be under Islamic political and military control. A fourth concerns
> the commercial and military incursions by Westerners on Islamic soil,
which
> they liken to the invasion of the hated crusaders. The way they see it,
our
> culture spits in the face of theirs. A fifth concerns jihad--a holy war to
> protect and defend the faith. A sixth is the idea of a martyr, a man
willing
> to sacrifice himself for the cause. His reward is eternal glory--an
eternity
> in heaven surrounded by willing young virgins. In some cases, there is a
> promise that his family will be taken care of by the community.
>
> Social and Political Conditions: Cultures of Despair
>
> Most Islamic would-be martyrs not only share these beliefs but have also
> grown up in a culture of despair: they have nothing to lose. Eliminate
such
> poverty and you eliminate the breeding ground for terrorists. When the
Bush
> administration speaks of eliminating terror, it does not appear to be
> talking about eliminating cultures of despair and the social conditions
that
> lead one to want to give up your life to martyrdom.
>
> Princeton Lyman of the Aspen Institute has made an important
proposal--that
> the world-wide anti-terrorist coalition being formed address the causal
> real-world conditions as well. Country by country, the conditions (both
> material and political) leading to despair need to be addressed, with a
> worldwide commitment to ending them. It should be done because it is a
> necessary part of addressing the causes of terrorism--and because it is
> right! The coalition being formed should be made into a long-term global
> institution for this purpose.
>
> What about the first cause--the radical Islamic worldview itself.
Military
> action won't change it. Social action won't change it. Worldviews live in

> minds, then future minds? The West cannot! Those minds can only be changed
> by moderate and liberal Muslims--clerics, teachers, elders, respected
> community members. They need to be recruited to a worldwide full-time
> effort, not just against terror, but against hate. Remember that "taliban"
> means "student."  Those that teach hate in Islamic schools must be
replaced
> --and we in the West cannot replace them. This can only be done by an
> organized moderate, nonviolent Islam.  The West can make the suggestion,
but
> we alone are powerless to carry it out. We depend on good will and courage
> of moderate Islamic leaders. To gain it, we must show our good will by
> beginning in a serious way to address the social and political conditions
> that lead to despair.
>
> But a conservative government, thinking of the enemy as evil, will not
take
> the primary causes seriously. They will only go after the enabling causes.
> But unless the primary causes are addressed, terrorists will continue to
be
> spawned.

>
> Public Discourse
>
> The Hon. Barbara Lee (D, CA), who I am proud to acknowledge as my

> his War on Terrorism as he sees fit:
>
>
>   I am convinced that military action will not prevent further acts of

>
> Foreign Policy
>
>
> I have been working on a monograph on foreign policy. The idea behind it
is

> environment, human rights, women's rights, the condition of children,
labor,
> international public health issues (e.g., AIDS in Africa), sustainable
> development, refugees, international education, and so on. The monograph
> comes in two parts.
>
> First, the book points out that the metaphors that foreign policy experts
> have used to define what foreign policy is rules out these important
> concerns. Those metaphors involve self-interest (e.g., the Rational Actor
> Model), stability (a physics metaphor), industrialization
(unindustrialized
> nations are "underdeveloped"), and trade (freedom is free trade).
>
> Second, the book proposes an alterative way of thinking about foreign
policy
> under which all these issues would become a natural part of what foreign
> policy is about. The premise is that, when international relations work
> smoothly, it is because certain moral norms of the international community
> are being followed. This mostly goes unnoticed, since those norms are
> usually followed. We notice problems when those norms are breached. Given
> this, it makes sense that foreign policy should be centered around those
> norms.
>
> The moral norms I suggest come out of what I called in Moral Politics
> "nurturant morality." It is a view of ethical behavior that centers on (a)
> empathy and (b) responsibility (for both yourself and others needing your
> help). Many things follow from these central principles: fairness, minimal
> violence (e.g., justice without vengeance), an ethic of care, protection
of
> those needing it, a recognition of interdependence, cooperation for the
> common good, the building of community, mutual respect, and so on. When
> applied to foreign policy, nurturant moral norms would lead the American
> government to uphold the ABM treaty, sign the Kyoto accords, engage in a
> form of globalization governed by an ethics of care--and it would
> automatically make all the concerns listed above (e.g., the environment,
> women's rights) part of our foreign policy.
>
> This, of course, implies (a) multilateralism, (b) interdependence, and (c)
> international cooperation. But these three principles, without nurturant

ABM

>

Jack, could you post the following onto that U of Buffalo list?

Thanks

Todd

"AN AGREEMENT TO MOURN: WRITING AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, 2001"

This is being written in Europe, exactly one week after the "attack on
America" which so shook the world; events, at time of publication, may wel=
l
have established the identity of the mastermind(s) - so far still mere
conjecture, but likely radical Islamic terrorists - and worse, still, may
have spiralled out of control into an apocalyptic cycle of revenge, of
Biblical proportions. As likely as that Bush Bible Belt versus Taliban
scenario may seem, leaving ash on my face, I must write as if a semblance =
of
"civilisation" - and publications like this one - will be here in the near
future.
One of the first things that happened, after the second and third planes h=
it
their symbolic targets, was that people, who could not communicate via the
jammed phone lines, began sending emails. At first these, like most emails=
,
were not literary, or self-conscious, in any way. Some were brief, and mos=
t
to the point: "holy fuck"; "unbelievable"; "Oh my God"; and so on. Soon,
they become slightly more poignant, and informative: "Am safe; think most =
of
my friends are; am waiting for my brother to call..." or sister, or husban=
d,
or girlfriend... and New Yorkers, mostly, let us knew they were still
standing.
Then came the anti-climax of the days that followed Day One of the media's
visual bounty (whenever before had live feed, even during the OJ chase, be=
en
so damned cinematic that Industrial Light & Magic really couldn't better t=
he
eye candy, however horrific?) when "America mourned" and the world was
silent for three minutes, holding its breath for considerably longer.
Sad, traumatic and interesting as these other days have been, filled with
incident and new leads, and sudden revelations of the efficacy of the cell
phone, and the heroism of quotidian air passengers, thrust into Die Hard
roles (one man thought to have tackled the hijackers and helped crash the
plane in Pennsylvania, it was reported, had a tattoo of Superman on his
shoulder) - well, they weren't the day anymore; we won't admit it, but we
half mourned the adrenaline rush of the high octane spectacle, the feeling
that life was, finally, as big as the movies, scarier than fiction.
That's when the emails became literary. Sincerely, I want to believe, many
of my friends in New York, journalists, poets, editors, among other
life-style choices, came home at night from feeding sandwiches to firemen,
or wandering oddly-hushed Gotham streets - and began to write long,
emotional and humane emails. They spoke of their gutted feelings, their
pride in fellow New Yorkers, the deeds they'd done - as if Beowulf's
warriors, after slaying a dragon, had sat down to brag over mead in a hall=
,
and filled the air with tales of valour and loss.
I don't want to comment on the writing, except to say, I hope someone has
saved it all, because these emails - there must have been thousands of the=
m
written and sent to millions more - are a rich anthology of a significant
moment. However, the poignant fact about writing sincerely - anyone who ha=
s
kept a diary will have experienced this - is that you can't keep it up for
very long. Style intrudes; as do clich=E9s; and narrative; and the need of=
 the
writer to turn life into art. Some of the poets, though, did valiant jobs =
of
rising to the electronic-epistolary occasion. Still, it was mostly
well-meaning ephemeral dross.
Which brings me to the death of a certain kind of poetry, now, after
September 11, in this, our post-paranoid world. Certainly, poetry has had
unusually intense pressure put upon it before, by the demands of history;
some would even say the sort of coal-to-diamonds pressure that produced th=
e
best of Yeats, or Auden - and maybe the worst of Pound.
We've been writing and reading poems for more than half a century since we
were told that, after Auschwitz, poetry was now unacceptable - the horror =
of
genocide too terrible to justify anything as glib as beautiful language (a=
s
if poetry is basically about beauty). Heaney, among others, has attempted =
to
show that poems can also be used to redress injustice, and speak from a
variety of positions, some those of the victim - and Plath certainly showe=
d
that some holocausts reside on the tongue, and in the heart.
But that's not what I mean, exactly. Let me confess I was one of the first
to write a poem commemorating the dead on September 11th, 2001. I am almos=
t
ashamed to say I think I wrote it less than an hour after the second tower
of the WTC collapsed. I then emailed it to hundreds of people on my Agent
poetry list. I'm not sure why I did this - one hopes it isn't
grandstanding - but I think it had something to do with the concept of the
poet as war correspondent and healer all rolled into one. I suppose I was
inspired by Edward Thomas, or Dylan Thomas, for that matter - the former
writing of the trenches of W.W.I, the latter, likely blotto, of the Blitz.
There has been a tradition of poets responding to catastrophes and wars, a=
s
they happen (as well as after). Thomas Hardy's lines on the Titanic, or
Hopkins' on the wreck of the Deutschland, in which five Franciscan nuns
drowned, could hardly be bettered as examples. One could argue that the
collapse of the Twin Towers is, more than "our Pearl Harbour" or Kennedy
assassination, our Titanic (sad as this might be for director Cameron). It
was the moment when our Western civilisation's masterful technologies - je=
ts
and hyper-tall structures - collided, like iceberg and ocean liner. It was
our epoch's grand moment of failure - when old methods ceased to function.
It is also our Light Brigade being slaughtered, or our 1914.
But all these previous losses of security engendered masterpieces of poeti=
c
art - one thinks of The Wasteland's jaded urbanity and drained sang froid =
-
while this particular series of ultra-violent, tragic and sadistic events
seems destined not to. Now, I may well be proven wrong. I can assuredly
attest to the lack of greatness in my own poem, though it has its moments.
Still, rhetoric, even artfully wrought - or even a more post-modern pastic=
he
of eloquence - seems incapable of handling this sort of thing.
Can any historic event elude the poet's capacity to transform news into
"news that stays news"? Not before. But, as I tried to grapple with what h=
ad
happened - the sly Fu Manchu genius of the evil that choreographed the
second plane's trajectory just so, on the edge of the frame, as we all
watched the fist fireball - I sensed that lack of taste, or judgement, was
hovering at the edge of my claim on posterity.
What great sonnet sequence from the Hindenberg's flames? True, Rushdie use=
d
the air terrorism of Air India for the opening sequence of Satanic Verses.=

still... what has happened is that the moment is too graphically excessive
to need new visualisation, too heart-rendingly maudlin (the doomed couple
falling from the 101st floor, hand-in-hand, like Paolo and Francesca in
Dante) - and too fraught with information. A Kipling could do something wi=
th
the need for jingoism, I am sure, but our age, unlike Hugh Selwyn's, does
not now demand a grimace from poets.
There will be poems published on this event. But will they be good poems?
Will they be needed poems? When Dylan Thomas wrote his refusal to mourn, a=
nd
considered the death of children and old people under the Nazi aerial
bombardment, magazines sought such literate texts to express, confront and
ultimately endure such atrocities.
We, glued to CNN, had the inescapably repetitive and often prosaic mumblin=
gs
of commentators incapable, like Bush, of rising to the Churchillian moment=
.
Let alone Miltonic. I said "post-paranoid" world earlier, because I think
poems that work with themes of black boxes, and televisual violence, and
mediated super-events, are now suddenly as dated as all those poems,
sincerely written in the 30s about pylons and aerodromes. What is more
poetic - in Appolinaire's understanding of that term - than what the
terrorists themselves did? What more stunningly symbolic, nihilistic,
unforgettable, haunting, powerful, or contrived? In the end we are weary o=
f
this ancient world, the above-mentioned French poet wrote, at the start of
the 20th century. I think we are now about to become weary of this
post-modern, one, too. And with it, all sorts of literary tics we once
thought as self-reflexively-impressive as tattoos of Superman.

Marjorie -

The last time I heard this 92% invoked it was 1991 and I was walking
alongside a few thousand people headed for the UN. The next thing we knew
our containment policy was throttling a population whose leader, whatever
psychoses he may actually embody, is not impatient. Does 92% really
encourage you?

Yes, something has to be done - does that mean we march a professional
army into an area as dense with landmines as New Jersey is with people?
That we fly thousands of sorties over the poorest desert run by the least
recognized government? You tut tut the lack of nuance in a geopolitical
discussion among poets; surely you can imagine this other eight percent's
dread of the lack of nuance of any military response. For one thing,
talibanization of the region won't make our beyond-precarious economic
situation any prettier, even if civilians are flying less (jets consume
eight percent of the world's fossil fuels). For another, a regime that's
already come to power here through questionable means is talking about the
world - the world - in a very possessive language.

Yes, we must defend ourselves - an usher at my wedding lives a block and a
half from the rubble, my dad works three blocks away, but I'm lucky not to
have lost anybody (at least I haven't heard about anybody yet). I probably
lack the experience that makes the idea that military action stops
terrorism make sense. I also probably don't understand why the first
response shouldn't be to find some things out -- who did it, how they
work(ed), and what makes them do it. (I'm glad ABC intends not to air the
crash footage again; will they now ask their reporters to ask government
sources how they *know* the things they claim to know?) I certainly don't
understand the logic of the elected officials who want simultaneously to
bomb villains trained by the CIA and recruit new villains for the CIA. And
if you're not skeptical about the creation of something called a Homeland
Security office, please reassure those of us who are.

I'm not going to quibble about percentages -- even if we're all trained to
understand poll figures are responses to some controlling party's binary
logic, thousands of people were killed here by people who clearly had
their act together, and millions more of us were stunned. If the question
were phrased a certain way, I'd probably be among that 92% too. But we're
poets, and we're permitted to have a response that doesn't fall into that
question's despair. We're entitled to a despair -- and a sanity -- of our
own. I hope Drew Gardner won't mind my repeating his response:  "I'm going
to Saturn. They don't do things this way on Saturn."

Back in my grad school days, I took two courses from Theodore Silverstein--
Old English and Chaucer--and, although I haven't thought of him much during
the intervening years, I was both sorry and pleased to see his obituary in this
morning's NYT. I was sorry for the usual reasons, and I was pleased because
this morning I learned more about him than I'd ever known before. How
little I usually knew about those who were my teachers. Silverstein's classes
were a delight and a pleasure, unlike most of those I remember from those
Chicago years. Here's to him. His obit is below.

              Dr. Theodore Silverstein, 96, Literature
              Scholar, Dies

              By DOUGLAS MARTIN

              Theodore Silverstein, a scholar of medieval literature at the University
              of Chicago whose subjects included Old English poetry and Late Latin
              visionary apocalypses and whose exploits as an intelligence officer in World
              War II were only recently revealed, died on Sept. 1.

              He was 96 and lived in Chicago.

              Dr. Silverstein was known for extending the work of 19th-century American
              scholars who realized that the dark ages were far from dark. His translation
              of the tale of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight was considered by some to
              surpass the previous definitive version, that of J. R. R. Tolkien.

              His scholarship was often playful, and he once made up a verse of Latin
              poetry to begin an article on his beloved Sir Gawain and signed it Petrus
              Argenteus, Latin for "silver stone."

              But his jokes sometimes suggested some fascinating thread in the rich
              tapestry of his life. The flyleaf of his translation of Sir Gawain, for instance,
              mentions "an adventure of a certain knight, during which Professor Silverstein
              commanded an Air Force unit which requisitioned the Eiffel Tower."

              The reference is to Dr. Silverstein's participation in an elite intelligence unit,
              which did indeed take over the tower to intercept communications of
              German planes during World War II.

              To be sure, his intelligence career contained stunning mishaps as well as
              brilliant successes. In trying to show his commanding officer a captured
              Belgian pistol, he accidentally fired the gun, hitting his superior in the groin.
              But Arnold C. Franco, who wrote a book about the unit, "Code to Victory"
              (Sunflower University Press, 1998), said the wounded officer, Harry Turkel,
              nonetheless later called him "the finest intelligence officer in the Western
              Theater."

              Hyman Theodore Silverstein was born on Oct. 11, 1904, in Liverpool and
              immigrated with his family to Boston in 1910. His father was a furniture
              salesman, and he attended the Boston Latin School. He then graduated from
              Harvard, where he stayed to earn his doctorate and teach.

              He accepted an appointment to teach at the University of Kansas City, a
              private college, now part of the University of Missouri. A freshman there,
              Mary Poindexter, became so enthusiastic about his brilliance that she
              attended all his lectures, even those in courses in which she was not enrolled.
              When he enlisted at 37 in the Army Air Forces in 1942, she wrote him every
              day for three years.

              They married after the war, after Dr. Silverstein agreed to her one demand:
              that he drop his first name, Hyman. His wartime career remained classified
              until the late 1980's. He first served in North Africa and Italy interrogating
              captured German pilots. He was then assigned to a new mobile unit that
              intercepted communications of German pilots and relayed them to Allied
              pilots.

              Dr. Silverstein joined the English department at the University of Chicago as
              an assistant professor in 1947, and stayed until his retirement in 1973.

              His intellectual work virtually began and ended with editions of the
              Apocalypse of Paul, an anonymous text written in the third century A.D., or
              even earlier, which tells of Paul's visits to heaven and hell. It was the subject
              of Dr. Silverstein's first book in 1935, and in 1997, he and Anthony Hilhorst,
              a Dutch scholar, cooperated on a version that many scholars consider
              definitive.

              Dr. Silverstein, who is also survived by his sister Mildred Nollman of
              Foxboro, Mass., is remembered for his talent for teasing. When a niece said
              she had never tried mincemeat pie, he gave a long lecture highlighted by the
              disclosure that the first such pie was found in fossilized form in China.

              He then offered what he said was the rival Russian claim, that the pie was
              actually Minsk pie.

Chris,

I do agree with Marjorie that, unless al Qaeda and its affiliates are
literally disabled, future attacks on the US on a like scale of 9/11 or
worse are inevitable. That would be a narrow response, but a reasonable one,
I believe.

However, the larger question I think is how does the left (small "l,"
complex, international, decentered, multifaceted) respond to what is quite
evidently the contemporary equivalent of facism. I believe that every other
question is a subset of this one.

    Consider these points:

    (1) Everyone has had the opportunity to see over 5,000 people, most of
them the most ordinary folks in the world, die very horrible deaths. This
total is more than the attack on Pearl Harbor and the sinking of the Titanic
combined - this is a visceral shock to the system that we will all be
suffering effects from for years.

Review by Audrey Leonard in Small Press Traffic online
 http://www.sptraffic.org/html/book_reviews/anthologies.html

"One must certainly applaud the work of Erato Press editors Marcella Durand,
Richard O'Russa, and Karoline Schleh. Their selection of artworks and
writings creates a compelling landscape of the hearts and minds of
contemporary city-dwellers. As Durand has it in her introduction, "we are
all motion and transaction." Alice Notley, an outsider poet who's made it on
to Penguin's list, contributes the largest selection, three pieces exploring
cities platonic, supersonic, eerie and plain, sometimes all four in a single
turn of phrase. Her work is steadily exuberant and plaintive as her lines
and sentences traverse syntax and image in odd and pleasing measures.
Lisette Copping's image of what look like two sleepy eyes in a tree trunk is
the perfect companion to Notley's "The City Drifting". Lisa Jarnot's "This
Is
My Only Job", a foray into a New Jersey both visionary and cruddy, is a
superb prose poem of crowded solitude. Other contributors include Notley's
son Anselm Berrigan -- his "The Hunt of the Frail Stag" adds a neat touch of
lightness to the eternally combustive questions of urban denizens -- as well
as poets Will Alexander, Rachel Levitsky, Eleni Sikelianos, and Edwin
Torres, and artists Mitchell Long and Dan Piersol."

Now the Bush Administration is considering the establishment of
special military tribunals. Suspected terrorists could be tried
without the ordinary legal constraints of American justice. During
World War II, German saboteurs were tried secretly that way ...

(This would mean suspending habeas corpus, right?)

Sorry, but this is complete rubbish.  You cannot critique
social institutions (or anything else) without canons of
logical argumentation.  And analytic philosophy is bigger than
some smug poets recognize.  Chomsky is essentially an
analytic philosopher when he wears his linguist hat.  I have
just referred on the brit-po list to Elizabeth Anscombe's
impassioned presentations of the (_very restrictive_) traditional
just-war doctrine, in which she execrates attacks on
civilians.  If she isn't an analytic philosopher, I don't know
who is (by the way, Retallack talks about her in the preface
to Musicage).  I would be interested to hear G. A. Cohen's
remarks on the current situtation (he's been called an
'analytic marxist', i.e. one that dumps Hegel in the dustbin
where he belongs).

Here you have my complete sympathy.  I lost my 60s record
collection in a fire in 1977.

I was, until two weeks ago, working in 1WTC.  I witnessed
the burning buildings directly, though I managed to get the
ferry back to New Jersey before the towers fell.  I think
Nick Piombino is quite right that those of us who were
there have a different set of emotional reactions from those
who saw this as part of the news 'spectacle'.  But this hasn't
made me a war-monger or shut down my critical faculties,
some of which (the horror!) have been honed on analytical
philosophy.

Hiya,

if the USA / EU / UN / NATO wants to show what a great 'civilisation' it
really is then it will not retaliate in any warring kind  -  that would
demean such a claim.

Who would be acting in self-defense? Would it be those 80 nation states
whose citizens were represented by victims of the WTC attack? This is
already a somewhat (and interesting for all that) extended concept of and
understanding of the 'self'.

Is it an ideology / a translocal alliance / a global trading community that
needs to act in self-defence? IF (and i have to speak in complete ignorance
of personal experience in such matters here) one wanted to goad someone(s)
into a fight surely the most frustrating of all responses, that which would
rubbish one's intentions, would be a form of response which did not trade
kind with kind? It is just as likely that further attacks (on this entire
body of 'selfhood') will follow from counter-aggression. More 'passers-by'
will be drawn into an already futile fight.

The BIG story is surely the fact that US / Allies' preparation for 'war' (a
legal declaration of which invokes statehoods - and perhaps it is an
opportune moment for the base falsity of the continued formations of
statehood to be addressed) hogs the headlines, whilst the story of 200,000
and rising numbers of starving refugees already heading, abandoned, towards
death on the roads out of Afghanistan is tagged at the end of the current
bulletins. Surely the positioning of those two stories in another order
would reveal the decivilising futility of what beckons.

Hi,

I knew little about Winnicott until working with a student on their PhD
which used his ideas of transitional phenomena and intermediate space in
respect of writing. Picking up Nick's comments on the transitional object,
the following are direct from D.W.Winnicott's 'Playing and Reality':

'there may emerge some thing or some phenomenon - perhaps a bundle of wool
or the corner of a blanket or eiderdown, or a word or tne, or a mannerism -
that becomes vitally important to the infant for use at the time of going
to sleep, and is a defence against anxiety, especially anxiety of
depressive type...This object goes on being important.'

I'd be wanting to introduce the concept of the 'tragedy of the commons'
into such a thinking process.

love and love

Hi,

several posters have remarked here on this fact in recent days, but the
continued use of 'America' and 'Americans' is part of the perceptuial
problem. Friends of mine in the USA have grinned when i pointed this out
before, saying, it's just to rile everyone else. Hmmmm

I write from the unfortunately recondeconstructed 'United Kingdom', knowing
that we stand shoulder to shoulder with everyone in the formations and
perpetuations of this problem.

love and love

The local news here in Los Angeles more than once showed demonstrations at
Caltech and I believe Berkerely.  Whether or not this coverage is
proportionate is hard to say.  Still, I was surprised to see it a all.
However, yesterday on Vermont Blvd. a rather large demonstration took place
in front of a Sikh mosque.  I didn't see any coverage of that.

Now that we are entering into war conditions, I imagine there will be a lot
of uncertainty about what is and is not occurring.

For instance, I have not seen any reportage of peace demonstrations in
major media, though Elizabeth Treadwell mentions them occurring at
Berkeley. Apparently 2000 students rallied but "you can't hear them."

You have to know who or what you are defending yourself from.  If it's bin
Laden from whom we are defending ourselves, then the list of targets for
self-offense continue well into the very heart of the US intelligence
establishment, NATO, and even the White House.   Yes, the CIA was channeling
him money through the KLA up through the end of 1999, AFTER bin Laden was an
Official Enemy.  Does that not sound criminal to you?  We helped line his
pockets even after he was a Public Enemy  (Of course you simply do not have
to believe me or a host of people inside the intelligence establishment
speaking out against the actions of their own.)

We're not going to be able to bring all of these criminals to justice in
order to really protect ourselves.  Therefore self-offense, er, self-defense
will be another mockery of justice.   Instead all we will witness is some
businesspeople and/or narcotrafficers quietly eliminating some of their
partners while noisily killing a bunch of innocent civilians to satisfy the
apparent will of the people.

There will always be the possibility of another terrorist attack but, should
we let fear control our lives, we will also let the arbiters of fear take
over.

If the US is suddenly no longer a superpower and ceases to be a big weapons
consumer or some colonial-imperialist dictator-installing provider of
genocidal power in the name of being a "superpower", I know I'll be OK.  At
least we won't have so many attacks any more.  At least I will feel better
knowing I was not funding Nazis any more.

The war already IS an "intelligence" war.  Clearly it's not a "wisdom" war.
The other war, the public spectacle, will be for entertainment and the
closing of the credibility gap.

If you're in a classroom and your back is turned and some unknown individual
hits you with a spitball, do you have "the wisdom" to turn around and decide
it's the bad kid in the class and then punish him?  Or do you instead punish
the whole class until someone confesses?  Neither response has any
justification yet that's the US Government's approach to "self-defense"
here.

Unfortunately less than 8% of US Citizens understand any of this.  Most of
the 92% would go on and punish the whole class.

Frankly, I'm tired of superpowers.

On Friday morning, on the subway, I saw the first media report that Boston
was "targeted" for a terrorist attack this weekend. The information or
rumor grew from a phone call between Ashcroft and the Massachusetts
governor. Later in the day all authorities were downplaying the report as
"false." Nevertheless the usually crowded places in Boston on Saturday were
not crowded.

On Friday night we caught about ten minutes of the celebrity fundraiser on
television. Neil Young's performance was contained in that ten minutes. He
sang John Lennon's "Imagine." Though I've heard the song hundreds of times
before, this time I felt a heaviness in my chest and throat that didn't
easily go away. This is where I stand on the current "crisis;" in the
lyrics of that (unwitting?) anarchist song. And also, right behind
Congresswoman Barbara Lee: yes, the attacks of September 11 are a horrible
instance of mass murder, but they cannot allow us to support an open-ended
vague war in potentially several countries against an unspecified enemy.
(And yet there shall be one and, as with the Gulf War, there's really not a
lot you can do about it.)

On Sunday we attended the American Friends Service Committee Peace Rally in
Copley Square. Several hundred people, perhaps a thousand, sat on the grass
between the public library and the Episcopal church and listened to several
speakers, singers, and poets. The majority of speakers were clergy of many
different religions. It was the historian Howard Zinn whose brief talk
moved me the most and, judging from the applause and cheers of the crowd,
moved many other people too.

Zinn cited both the spirit of Lennon's song and the action of Barbara Lee
as models for people opposed to military retaliation. You cannot, he said,
expect in modern warfare, with the technology capabilities of the US, to
launch any military action and not kill thousands of civilians in the
process. We should be eliminating the basic causes in the world---poverty,
sickness, repression---that allow environments for terrorism to thrive.

Now that the intense emotions felt in the immediate aftermath are subsiding
(not going away but certainly not as intense) it's becoming possible as
well as very necessary to think critically again. It's already too late to
change the immediate actions of the government (they got twice the amount
of money asked for and an authority to wage war beyond compare). But to
learn from the Gulf War there is little that any citizen group could do to
change the inevitable. (I say this because when Saddam Hussein agreed to
withdraw unconditionally from Iraq days prior to the air war, Bush
dismissed the offer as a "sick joke." There was no stopping US plans for
war. Today, it's the same people, literally, running things.)

Noam Chomsky said the attacks were "a gift to the hard jingoist right." The
gift is the public support the Bush administration will have in doing
anything it likes in terms of a response, including prepping the American
public for a long war that will have "costs," declaring that the situation
meets the requirements for tapping into the Social Security surplus, and
also acknowledging potential small-scale "tactical" nuclear strikes.

Last Thursday the president told the world everyone, every country, is
either with us or against us. The time may be very brief when dissent in
the US against this "war" will be equated with terrorism itself.

In the media the attacks are finally being talked about as a continuation
(a retaliation) of the Gulf War. A "continuation" because that war has
never ended. The US "coalition" of eleven years ago may not be as large and
active as it was for a horrific six weeks or so in February 1991, but the
war against Iraq has never ended. Nor has the US's "temporary" military
base in Saudi Arabia ever been removed. Supposedly this has been a big
reason for a lot of angry, "America-hating" people in the Middle East. This
is being talked about now in the press, that is in the past few days. Why
wasn't it talked about ten years ago?

And to talk about it now, to talk about anything but the people killed in
the attacks is construed as callous not to mention (shudder) unpatriotic.

Meanwhile, besides the admirable responses I've read here from Ron, Brian,
Marcella, Barrett, the poets who can reach the outside world seem to do so
with utter lameness. Andrei Codrescu, writing in the Plain Dealer
(9/18/01), says (much like Tom Petty) that the waiting is the hardest part.
"Whatever happens next will define everything we are going to do….we have
rarely waited this impatiently for our national life to give direction to
our individual lives." Also, and this is embarrassing, "waiting for news,
obsessively glued to TV and radio. I cannot begin to express my admiration
for the news people who keep us engaged every minute, 24 hours a day. They
are heroic, intelligent, hardworking."

But where I have received "news" I found useful almost exclusively from the
Web, Codrescu writes, "The Internet, too, is buzzing, but mostly with
make-busy noises without much substance, opinions and theories of every
sort… People with little authority, moral or otherwise, are brushing off
moldy left-wing or right-wing arguments against our government. Hollow
theories and tired cliches spew forth. Total nuts like Noam Chomsky and
shameless self-promoters like Christopher Hitchens on the left…are blaming
America for the terror. It's unconscionable."

Can you imagine? There are arguments against "our" government being made?
Reductive viewpoint about "blame" aside.

Someone please tell me where you've heard this cliché before: if you're
actually interested in removing the threat of violence, you seek to
understand it, especially in the heat of a terrible moment. If, on the
other hand, you're interested in escalating the cycle of violence, you
don't. This is Chomsky talking about the attacks and citing Ireland as
evidence. It's a cliche I'd like to hear on the television news shows more
often, if ever.

Ron Silliman's post certainly reflects years of experience as a committed
and effective organizer of leftist causes. You remind me in that post of
the mentors (all Socialists) I have worked with in Cambridge in the past
five years in tenant struggles. Thank you for that.

There's not a lot one can do to prevent the coming US attack. But I agree
with Ron's Nine points of things "to be done" to mitigate what is certain
to be a bloodbath, worldwide disaster, and floodgate of future terrorist
attacks here and abroad.

There was a rally here at Ohio University last week with at least 100 people
to coincide with the national campus demonstration, maybe more. It got
student paper coverage--I haven't looked for more yet.

Marjorie, I do understand that if we don't "do something THERE WILL BE
ANOTHER ATTACK." However, I tend to think that there will be another attack
if and when we do something, too. I don't see any way, at this time, that
there won't be another attack. I'm not saying we shouldn't do something,
but I read you here as implying that there's a greater chance of there not
being another attack if we retaliate and find the terrorists and bring them
to justice. While I wish that were true, I tend to doubt it.

NO! - U.S. military strikes are PRECISELY the response that the

The idea that one can protect oneself if someone is determined to make an
attack is a big misunderstanding. Britain's prisons are filling up in the
mistaken belief that crime can be ended. Just now fools in our government
are speaking of reducing liberty in order to protect liberty. But they like
several others around the world are following their own agenda - a kind of
looting

I suspect that many of those who want something to be done would settle for
anything... They want to feel something is happening. But people wanting
*something to be done aren't necessarily proof of wise understanding. For
example, there is a considerable lobby in UK for the government to do
something about the flooding of houses built on flood plains... like what?!

Sometimes there is nothing to be done

I think it would be a start if the evidence against bin Laden was made
available, had been made available, if it exists...

He says it isn't him. Maybe it isn't. Maybe it's Iraq. We could always bomb
Iraq...

 I heard last night that when this supposed evidence *is finally available
it won't be given to the Afghans - because they don't have the same judicial
system as USA. What kind of arrogance is that? One stage off from "These
dark fellows wouldnt understand"

We are in great need of an international judicial system and it is a matter
of regret that the US government has resisted that

But the UN is there and should be used. That Sudan has supported your
President suggests to me the likelihood that they are scared to do anything
else, not consensual behaviour

*I am old enough to hear the postulated "global terrorism network" as an
echo of the global communist network I grew up hearing about. It's never
that simple. It wasn't that simple when it was the wiles of the tempter
everywhere.

If there is a terrorist network, by all means let's dismantle it; but that
is only an obverse or reverse (depending on your point of view) of the
"global arms trade". Let's dismantle that too. OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE
ANOTHER ATTACK.

The idea of doing away entirely with the arms trade entirely is of course
utterly hopeless; ditto the bogeymen

We can sit and debate the
| similarities between our crimes and their crimes till we're blue in the
| face, but unless we do something

Doing that IS doing something. Neither your country nor mine, as an entity,
is free of a prima facie charge of terrorism. There *is terror in
Afghanistan now. That vast movement of people running from the dead-or-alive
talk but they know not where must lead to deaths among the weak, the old,
the sick. Terror is doing that.

DO.... NOTHING... beyond sending aid OR THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ATTACK

& the attack on USA *was another attack. It's just that the other attacks
haven't been on USA's mainland but they were attacks on innocent human
beings. PEOPLE are always being killed in hundreds, and some by USA, some by
UK, some by others including official terrorists. Perhaps it's easier to see
that from here though I am glad we haven't had such a one off horror as your
country has suffered

EVERY attack EVERY response is done in the name of some good, is justified
in somebody's eyes

Any violent or repressive response is wrong. I am deeply sorry if that is
not understood and fearful for the future.

all the best

Lawrence

Apparently all we new growths on the slopes of public discourse needed was
to be cut down at a stroke and fashioned into a straw child. If not yet up
to the demands of history, we are now at least upright enough to take
instruction. Your stern parental presence is an inspiration to us all.
Speaking for myself, I hope one day to be a real live boy.

But I'm troubled by the fact that my grandmother -- who has a generation on
you -- seems to agree with Laura Elrick's post of today. If I recall her
words in our last phone conversation correctly, she characterized the choice
between criminal investigation and open-ended war as one between
internationalism and imperialism. We've settled the issue of age. Is it time
to return to the question of wisdom?

I think there's one thing that is still wholly misunderstood on this
List and maybe I see it because I'm older (if not wiser) than most of
you.  The reason there has to be action (we can debate what kind of
action) is 99% self-defense, pure and simple.  We can sit and debate the
similarities between our crimes and their crimes till we're blue in the
face, but unless we do something THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ATTACK.  Maybe
not a plane, maybe this time germ warfare or the water supply or a
bridge--whatever.  So far most of the action has been finding the
terrorists--which I applaud since I believe this should be an
intelligence war not a bombing one.  But without concerted action by
ourselves and our allies, you won't have to worry about the U.S. being a
nasty Imperialist super power any more.  Because it may not be here at
all.

Nice letter, Charles. I appreciate it. I was not meaning ridicule
when I asked about getting a gun while getting a flag. I know that
you ar seeing the relationship from inside the US, and I think that
it is hard for people inside the US to see what it looks like from
outside. We get, for example, every day, lots of US tourists who are
surprised at the border that they have to leave their guns outside
Canada. They always ask "But how will I protect myself?" I remember
one time on one of the many US patriotic days, I think it was Flag
Day, stopping in a Wyoming city, I forget which one, and there was
window display after window display in storefrons. In one there was
nothing but flags and hand grenades. We got away from there as fast
as we could. I dont know what flag-waving means in the US ecxactly,
but I have to say that when I see them, I get scared.

But I am remembering going to a baseball game in Detroit, and there
was a lot of the usual flag business, but then their was a trio of
military types in uniform, carrying rifles on their shoulders,
marching the flag in fronm center field. At a baseball game!!! I have
seen this on TV several times since. I mean when baseball is
militarized, one should cadst an analytical though frightened eye.

I'm sure someone else has said this already, but there
will be another attack anyway.  There is no way that I
know of, other than working towards the Buddhist goal
of total enlightenment for all sentient beings, to
"wipe out" terrorism.  The horrible gas attacks on the
subways in Japan were the work of citizens of that
country.  Oklahoma City was not the work of a born and
bred American.  No amount of "concerted effort" on the
part of this or any country is going to stop what
seems to be, unfortunately, a constant and immediate
access to Wrong Action by whomever feels the need to
act this way.  I mean, come on, haven't we all been
blinded, at one point or another, by hatred or
jealousy or terror?  As long as people still feel that
way, there will be terrible acts.  Retaliation only
continues the cycle of suffering.  Compassion is the
only way out.

**** NEWS ABOUT SMALL PRESS NIGHTS ****
****         AT SIBERIA            ****

Now more than ever it is important to support Really
Independent Presses! That's why Ugly Duckling Presse has
started a SMALL PRESS NIGHTS series, making independent and
anti-commercial publishers the focus of our gatherings in
the Cellar of SIBERIA.

If you have a small magazine or make books by hand or have
a penchant for xeroxing zines, let us know and we'll set up
a night for you and yours and bring others to it. A book or
magazine release, a reading, films, bands anything is a
good reason and a good way to promote your SMALL but
intense endeavor.

It's important for us little people to meet each other,
exchange the hard-to-find, non-B&N products of our labors,
as well as our ideas about the future, about alternative
distribution systems and the actions & collaborations we
can make together.

To get involved or arrange a small press night, email me
(Matvei) at ugly.duckling@pobox.com. And please pass this
message on.

So far our schedule...

September 26:  UGLY DUCKLING PRESSE - 6x6 #4
October 3:      KOJA MAGAZINE & PRESS
October 17:    MASS DEPORTATION PRESS

*** POETRY NEWS ***
The Cellar encourages informal readings, so Filip Marinovic
(poet and editor#4 of 6x6) will be spearheading an effort
to bring poets/writers to the space with notebooks in hand,
reading the freshest pages, talking, shaping what we
pen-graspers and keyboard-meister must do in this POST NYC
world we live in.

Marjorie, are you saying that the people who then get their land,
houses, children, etc blasted to hell will say "Okay, we see the
light. We will no longer feel the urge to fight you"? Have you heard
what Islamic people have been saying in the Middle east in the past
few days?

and I agree completely with her.

Unless the Western left 'does something' by getting
huge numbers on the streets to match the anti-war
actions gripping Pakistan at the moment, there
certainly will be more terrorist attacks on the West.

The 'guarantor of peace' is not new police state
legislation, the indiscriminate arrest and indefinite
detention of unlucky American Muslims, or the
targeted, 'clean' extra-judicial assasinations that
self-proclaimed 'moderates' in the West have suddenly
fallen in love with: the guarantor of peace is the
defeat of US and Israeli forces in the Middle East and
the defeat of US policies for the Middle East.

It's as simple and as difficult as that.

Although few of us live in the Middle East, we can all
play a role in protecting Marjorie and ourselves from
further attacks.

Seeya for the march: next Saturday, QE 2 Square, at
4.30: Richard :) and any other Aucklanders lurking
hereabouts...

Cheers,
Scott

Here's some info. on a peace action sent to me by a friend.
She asked me to pass it on and thought you might be interested:

Marianne
This past Saturday artists who are concerned about the
events of 9/11 performed a piece entitled OUR GRIEF IS
NOT A CRY FOR WAR.

At 12 noon  they walked single file into Union Square
and took their places in a semi-circle. For one hour
they stood in silence wearing face masks and placards
silk-screened with "OUR GRIEF IS NOT A CRY FOR WAR."
The response to this performance was electric, many
people coming up to take stickers, find out who these
people were, and thank them. Some were in tears.

The group who organized the performance were artists
in film, video, visual art, theater, dance, spoken
word. They do not want their grief to be used as a
justification for war, attacks on Arabs and Muslims,
and new repressive laws or clampdowns.

THE NEXT PERFORMANCE is scheduled for tuesday (9/25)
at 6 pm in Times Square.

MEET in the triangle just north of the Army
Recruitment Center between 43rd and 44th.

PLAN to arrive as close to 6 pm as possible.

WEAR black if you can.

PLEASE pass this on to anyone who might join us.

Hundreds of photographs were taken of this performance by people who saw

it, including two by an AP photographer which landed on the yahoo.com
homepage at 8:30 Saturday night.  Within an hour one of the pictures
became the "most popular" photo on the site, having been sent to other
people over 400 times.

Private Poetry Workshop in Manhattan
given by Hermine Meinhard

The soul or core of a poem lies in what is hidden, fleeting and
nonrational. This workshop will help students draw on those elusive aspects
of experience that give a poem its depth and mystery. Emphasis will be on
in-class improvisational exercises, using objects, language and outside
texts to spur associational thinking. We will experiment with direct and
indirect ways of=20
approaching material and with extending our range through nontraditional
uses of language and silence. And, working with journals, we will explore
the variety of ways a poem can come into existence through rapid generation
of text, fragments, accidents and mis-readings.

The class will be offered this fall in Manhattan as an eight-week
session on Wednesday evenings (excluding the Wednesday before Thanksgiving)
from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., beginning mid-October. The course fee is $280.

Hermine Meinhard is poetry editor of the literary journal 3rd bed. Her poem=
s
have been published or are forthcoming in Sonora Review, Willow Springs,
Luna, Kalliope, The Prose Poem, Poetry New York, 13th Moon and other
journals. She has been a finalist for the Levis and Intro Prizes for a book
of poetry, was the grand prize winner of the Sue Saniel Elkind Poetry Award
and a Pushcart Prize nominee. Other honors include artistic residencies at
Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, Ragdale and the Blue Mountain Center=
.
She has read her work in a variety of New York City venues, among them The
Kitchen, the Barrow Street Series, the Knitting Factory, and Cornelia Stree=
t
Caf=E9. She was poetry instructor for many years at The Writer's Voice and
currently teaches writing at NYU.

A friend and neighbor, a man from Pakistan, reported to us that the news
from home was broadcasting that all of the Jews who should have been in the
WTC were absent that day.  Implying, of course, that Israel plotted the
whole thing to gain further aid in its own violence against Arab peoples.

Marjorie: You assume that we can eliminate terrorism. We can't--one of the
dubious benefits of the epread of modern technology is that terrorism is
very easy--witness Timothy McVeigh, who wreaked considerable damage with
little support and not much intelligence.

We (the US) obviously will take action, and hopefully it will be limited
and wise and not create too many new enemies for us. That action may result
in a relative hiatus, which would not be a bad thing. But the only way to
reduce the danger of terrorism is to use that hiatus, if there is one, to
change the conditions on the ground in the rather large area that the
administration has designated as potential target so that large elements of
the population no longer act as a support network or as willing camouflage
for the terrorists. It's worth remembering that Bader-Meinhof is no longer
with us--it never achieved more than marginal support among the German
population. Irish terrorism is alive and well, on the other hand.

This is a big job that I doubt we'll undertake. It will require the wealthy
nations to stop using the poorer nations as despised sources for cheap
natural resources, cheap labor and captive markets and instead to elevate
those nations and their workers to the status of economic competitors, as
we did in Europe and Japan after WWII. Otherwise terrorists will continue
to be spawned and will continue to enjoy support and prestige, instead of
being regarded, as by most people in the US, as part of a small,
irreducible lunatic fringe.

Hi Marjorie, I think a lot of people on this list are understanding that
something must be done, and are thinking aloud (or a-text) about what that
might be. Among the confusing, horrifying and frustrating things is that no
matter what we do there will likely be another attack.

I think there's one thing that is still wholly misunderstood on this List
and maybe I see it because I'm older (if not wiser) than most of you. The
reason
there has to be action (we can debate what kind of action) is 99%
self-defense, pure and simple. We can sit and debate the similarities
between our crimes
and their crimes till we're blue in the face, but unless we do something
THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ATTACK. Maybe not a plane, maybe this time
germ warfare or the water supply or a bridge--whatever. So far most of the
action has been finding the terrorists--which I applaud since I believe this
should be an intelligence war not a bombing one. But without concerted
action by ourselves and our allies, you won't have to worry about the U.S.
being a
nasty Imperialist super power any more. Because it may not be here at all.

Fortunately, about 92% of the country, acc. to polls, seems to understand
this.

"I don't know if you print extracts from articles, but
I think Christopher Hitchens' piece is a gem all on
this list should read. It's also beautifully written!"


Christopher Hitchen's article 'Let's Not Get Too
Liberal' graphically demonstrates the  role being
played by the Guardian, that icon of the liberal left,
during the current crisis.

Normally, the paper is something of a Fabian gadfly,
buzzing  in an annoying if harmless manner around the
ears of Britain's intelligentsia and  midle classes.
At times, however, when its owners' interests are
threatened by anti-imperialist struggle abroad or
class conflict at home, the Guardian is only too happy
to play the role of necessary stand-in for more
right-wing media.

An opinion piece in the Times condemning strike action
is, after all, likely to elicit about as much
attention as the 'Dog Bites Man' story beside it. In
the Guardian, the same sentiment will ripple: after
all, it is sentiment from a 'left' newspaper, a paper
which normally 'loves' strikes! The strike in question
must be truly awful, and its condemnation by
right-wing media and politicians truly motivated  by
something other than the tawdry and the obvious!

Guardian writers have already, on the basis of
ludicrously inadequate evidence, accused the
anti-capitalist movement which had planned mass
anti-IMF protests this month of a inhumanly gleeful
response to the S 11 atrocities. In the atmosphere of
McCarthyism being whipped up in the US and Europe at
present, how many people have potentially been put in
danger by these loose claims?

Now Guardian columnist Hitchens has joined Bush, Straw
and Murdoch in the project of caricaturing,
decontextualising, and ultimately dehumanising
fundamendalist Muslims.

Here's a riposte to Hitchens from Priyamvada Gopal, an
Indian academic and Marxist. Rather entertaining it is
too!

<snip>

I can go into length about the various obvious
analytical  flaws in the Hitchens article, but it is
not a serious enough piece to merit that.  I plan
instead to have my students do it for a colonial
discourse analysis mid-term.  (Colonial discouse
analysis ordinarily bores me, still does. I almost
never teach it.  But perhaps Christopher as Rudyard
Kipling rattling gamely through the Khyber pass merits
a page of undergraduate writing as mine plough their
way through Kim, a department-required text at where I
teach).

My only reason for discussing Hitchens is my growing
disquiet (and disbelief) at what seems to be
increasing support within certain quarters of the
American left for the bizarre and culturalist notion
that there are, in fact, in the present-day, sutured
and separate sociopolitical systems in relation to
which late capitalism is "undeniably" better, both in
itself and for Marxist aspirations.

Seriously, somebody please explain this phenomenon to
me, with names, dates and examples.  Bin Laden
represents a non-capitalist, "worse than" movement?!
Bin Laden?!!!  A man with an MBA who made his billions
out of the construction industry and petro-dollars?!

Here's a thought: late capitalism begets with its
Oriental despot allies, and nourishes, when it is in
the mood,"revivalism" "fundamentalism,"
"neo-feudalism" "anti-secularism" and "Binladenism."
And feudalism likes the stock market.  To point to
this is not an apology or even an explanation for what
happened on September 11.  And frankly, if you don't
recognize the symbiotic interconnectedness of these
political systems and you have a vested interest in
defending, no advocating, "late capitalism" over these
"other social formations"-a vague term that no one
seems to have yet bothered to unpack-then, girlfriend,
 to put it euphemistically,
you've got some rather serious civilizational
hierarchy issues.


Actually, I think I  will go into the Hitchens piece
so I'm not culpable of vague generalizations myself
but I'll try to restrict myself to a few examples:

1. What is "Tribal piety"?   "Tribes" are the primal,
self-evident opposite of modernity and modern civil
society (that's how and why the imperial Brits
classified certain peoples as such in
the first place).  Hence, what we really have here is
the clash of tradition (East) and modernity (West),
and damn Hitchens'"farouche-loooking, wolfishly gruff"
driver for spoiling our fantasy by listening to Dire
Straits instead of-gotta love this-"the ululations of
some mullah."  I hope Hitchens wasn't too painfully
reminded of his days in the Khyber during NPR's
endless procession of rabbis, priests and mullahs last
week, punctuated by  requiems.  NYC is, of course,
unproblematically "the symbol of modernism and
innovation."  ModernISM?  Maybe he just meant the
architecture. Anyway, it all boils down to ideas.

2."Always homogenize" (that's me, not Hitchens.).  So
"bin Ladenism" not only pulled down the Bamiyan
Buddha, but its "co-thinkers" have been "heard" to
express condemnation for the Pyramids.  And while we
are at it, we can deploy this catch-all
neologism to account for certain kinds of pressures to
withdraw troops from Gaza,  militancy in Kashmir
(never mind that there are several factions in that
front alone), critiques of Zionism and,
folks - us - lefties. We too are "poisoned" by bin
Ladenism  Our analyses of unfortunate retaliatory
ideologies, to ask the "why" for which
there is no simple answer,  are "the moral equivalent
of the hateful garbage" that comes out of the Falwell
and bin La! den camps.

Analysis=Rationalization=Apologias.  This is not a
good time to make subtle distinctions, you know.
United we stand and all that. It just wouldn't do
right now to give each region-Algeria, Kashmir,
Pakistan, Iran, Kosovo, Gaza, Chechnya, India, or each
event-Kashmir conflicts, the Satanic verses
controversy, the maiming of women in Kabul,
leftist analysis or rightist preaching-its own context
and history even as we note the connections.  The East
is pretty much the same place with the same sort of
stuff going on everywhere.   So instead
of generalizing about American imperialism, generalize
about Islamic "fundamentalism"

3. All you "masochistic" lefties out there.
Disconnected as you are from ground realities (when
was the last time YOU tried to cross the Khyber?)--
learn this then.  You could have been on that
plane, "yes, even in the Pentagon."  Where would your
little cold-eyed analysis be then, huh?  THEN, while
you shat your pants,you would understand, without any
need for argument, that these guys don't just hate
what you hate, but Western civilization in toto.
(Isn't that what Bennett said about Fanon?).  Rally to
it, brother,it's YOU they don't like.  Meanwhile the
virtues of Western civilization are self-evidently
unique: "emancipated women" (can't think why that
sounds familiar);  "scientific enquiry" (all that crap
about the Arab roots of mathematics, Black Athena yada
yada); "its separation of church from state" (somehow,
I managed to miss that. In the UK, where I live, the
Head of State is also the "Defender of
THE faith,  and in India we don't usually hear "God
Bless India" after political speeches-YET.  But I
forgot that we superstitious natives are more
culturally and genetically prone to
god-genuflection).  And in the midst of all this
obviousness, many of us "non-Western" feminists and
progressives have actually managed to
pull out stuff on the long, illustrious history of
non-Western feminisms and the history of rational and
democratic values in our respective polities, heck,
even ! the Islamic ones,  much before the
advent of the West into our lives.  I guess secular
Indian forces should just acknowledge what our own
Hindu "fundoos" have been telling us all along and
what we've strenously denied in classically
unrealistic leftie fashion: that feminism, secularism
and democracy are Western values.

Oh dear, I suppose one has to say this for the
hundreth time.  Yes, analysis should not take the form
of "chickens coming home to roost."The situation is
way over-determined beyond that. And no, analyses of
American imperialism cannot simply "account" for mass
murder.   Yes, we need to think in more complicated
ways and try to find a way forward.  But arguing for
primal civilizational clash  does not seem
to me to be that way.

Well, one could go on, but it's actually not that
interesting beyond a point.  Let me just note
something that is as true of me as it is
of many of us in the left.  In our frustration at not
being able to "see the way forward" and our sense of
being painted into a corner, we are starting to turn
on each other to vent.  So, other lefties are
"masochistic", "ideological," "purists"
"non-pragmatic", "callous," "disappointing", "not
mourning enough," "unrealistic", "unempathetic"
"uncosmopilitan" "unsecular"  and so on.  Well, if it
keeps us talking, ok, but maybe we want to be careful
about the ways in which we let this situation hurt us,
such as the "us" is.

In solidarity,

Priya

air-bases in Saudi Arabia and the sanctions/no fly
zone against Iraq.
-------------------------------------------------------

DEAR BRIAN,

The three points that John Miller reported are
slightly mistranslated and re-ordered via Letterman
etc.

What you quote as the second point ("the air-bases in
Saudi Arabia") is the main point, but wasn't phrased
solely against "air-bases".

The fundamentalist ultimatum is that there should be
~no~ non-Muslims, none, not one, including civilians,
within the entire Arabian peninsula.

This has to do with their belief that that land itself
is--- PLEASE NOTE: holy ground.

Hence, the point against Israel follows; it is not
~specifically~ discriminatory as anti-semitic; it is
universally a taboo against ~all~ non-Muslims
("infidels").


As a formative influence in his life, years ago, bin
Laden's construction enterprise was the one awarded
the contract for the buttressing-up/restoration of the
architecture that houses the Ka'aba (!) and, after a
"wild youth" (Club Med of the Islamic world, etc.), he
underwent a profound conversion.

A sense of sacred space or holy ground may be
difficult for us Americanized to understand

(especially for those who understand their irreligion,
such as "politics" or the secular, to be ontologically
different from religion, who believe that Western
empiricism, skepticism, and cynicism made some quantum
leap break with tens of thousands of years of human
religiosity, . . . instead of seeing
rationalism-Americanism as another ~type~ of religion.
 [The god of money was Pluto]).

The closest the United States comes to remembering
"holy ground" is, of course, in the Native American
sense of such: you're familiar with recent
negotiations that were waged over industrial
development because Native holy ground had been
infringed upon.

Those who followed the "story" around the Temple Mount
in Jerusalem watched holy ground at play again.
(Interestingly, Jews are forbidden to walk onto the
Temple Mount, which is under Muslim jurisdiction,
~not~ [only] due to Muslim prohibition, but by
~Jewish,~ hallakhic law.  Because it's believed that
Solomon's Temple is inside the Mount but it's not
known exactly where the Holy of Holies might be within
that area, by Talmudic law Jews are not permitted to
trespass because of our current state of impurity, for
fear of crossing over the Sanctum Sanctorum that no
one except the High Priest was allowed to enter.)

These Islam fundamentalists have expanded that sense
of holy ground to the entire peninsula, an unusual,
perhaps unprecedented scale (from the little I know of
Islam.  The "jihadists" are also markedly un-Islamic
in their practice of suicide bombing [according to a
Muslim academic whom John Miller interviewed]).

Westerners seem to re-acquire an approximation of a
sense of holy ground only by death marking a spot.
Viz., the struggle over the convent and crosses at
Auschwitz.

As a New Yorker, you'll recall the African slave
cemeteries that were discovered in lower Manhattan,
and the problems around exhumation or the continued
construction by the builders who had stumbled across
the vast cemetery.  Jeffrey Dahmer's house was burned
to the ground, and the spot is thought to be
uninhabitable.  There was a campaign along the New
Jersey turnpikes of erecting small memorials at the
spots of car collision deaths.  Etc.

The link between ancient holy ground and this
XXth/XX1st cent. return of the repressed may be blood
stain: the Temple altars red with the slaughter of
livestock . . .

The cries for "The World Trade Center will be
re-built!" seem messianic and unrealistic to me.
(Jewish "extremists" in Israel, of course, are
dedicated to building The Third Temple, similarly.)
My sense is that the site, if it can ever be
decontaminated, hygiene-wise, will be too "holy".


I don't want to get too theoretical (I was initially
dismayed by all the first person narratives appearing
on the List, --- I don't know why it is that an
"anti"-first-person literary movement reverts into "I"
when there's the feeling of a ~really~ serious
subject, viz. Aaron Shurin's AIDS essays, "True," etc.
--- but I sort of miss the memoirs, now that the
breezier amateur politician bar stool opinions are
flowing, a masculinist "coolant," I think, getting all
prematurely theoretical and intellectual-hairy as a
way of retreating from softer sadnesses, palpable
groundedness) but---

an identification with holy ground cultures may have
been especially lost to us because our civilization's
sense of space went over to the concept of land as
~private~ property, land that could be owned.  (Holy
ground may be more rooted in nomadic hunter cultures,
us a settled agrarian civilization.)

{I was disturbed to read in ~Rain Taxi~last night ---
I hadn't know --- that Gilles Deleuze died from
jumping out a window a few years ago.}


I was out of the city for the first time this weekend
for the twins' 40th birthday party (my brother and
sister) and to visit Mother in the physical rehab
(revision surgery of hip replacement),--- and it was
strange to find the world still going along elsewhere
on quite different tracks, on the other side of the
river (they're more at the phase of ~anger,~ I felt,
New Yorkers more mournful)--- but helpful, reassuring
in a way, that society moves along at different strata
and some layers may persist unaffected, that the
fissures might not reverberate into cracks throughout
the entire system.

My sister was driving me back north from the shore
where family live --- a one-for-the-road snack of six
~bad~ oysters on half-shell, shrimp in the basket with
nothing ~but~ little breaded fried shrimp, no French
fries (when they say "in a basket," they're being very
literal: a basket; who said anything about anything
besides a basket?), out at a ~brise marine~ table on
the edge of the long Funland pier, dozens of
chatterbox gulls re-staging ~Suddenly Last Summer~
climactic bird ravenous god scene to fellow patrons
tossing French fries---

and my sister in the driver's seat pointed through top
of windshield at sky:

"Look!"

However poets have described them, "chevrons," the
trails of undulant giant capital Vs gliding across the
sky:

near sundown, GEESE heading south overhead.

Silent through the windshield.  That made me feel
better, sort of, that the vast millenia-old migrations
still go on, as scheduled.

One avenue I tried in the second week ("What is to be
done?"), especially after late '60s punchiness at
reemergence of The National Transitional Object
(flag), was---

emulating models like Gertrude Stein who wrote a Susan
 B. Anthony opera during days of flag-waving, Kenneth
Koch who wrote "George Washington Crossing The
Delaware" during flag-waving days, Larry Rivers'
spin-off "...Crossing The Delaware"series of
paintings, Jasper Johns' white flag, etc.,---

was

rather than let "them" just appropriate these symbols,
to take my own closer look at the patriotic
motherlode, bedrock, and see what it says to me, what
I might make of it:

been reading Francis Scott Key's Collected Poems
(author of the Star-Spangled Banner lyrics).

Some rewarding oddities:

He did a rhyming pentameter couplets translation of
Ajax's speech, XIIIth Bk. of Ovid;

a very strange "On Visiting the Pennsylvania Hospital"
("Madness here,/ . . . / On high-piled human skulls
his throne is fixed, / His bursting brows a burning
iron crown / Confines, and blends its fires with
fiercer flames / That from his ghastly eye-balls
wildly glare; / A robe of straw his giant form
conceals; / His hand a leaden sceptre wields, each
point / With terrors armed.  Ice, never melting,
gleams / From the one; from the other, fire
unquenchable; / Each, as it points to his devoted
prey, / With cold, or heat, or freezes or inflames /
The chambers of the brain, and stupefies / And chills
to dullest idiocy");

a ~very~ odd, somewhat buffo, long (107-line) poem, "A
Bear Story", ~with~ sequel! "Song" ("O, Bruin!  O,
Bruin! come back to thy chain / . . . / Thy
lady-pressed paws will be luscious to lick"); a
definite "dark streak" to Key, I think;

---but, to my point:


The biographical materials note that Key's first major
political commission (which lead to the ship-side
imprisonment where he wrote the "Banner") was in the
forced migration and encampment of the Creek Nation.

(More JJ research needed there.  To follow.)

Thought of the Creek Nation also, paradoxically, lent
me some hint of --- comfort?  Before us, there were
whole nations, civilizations, right here.  They're
gone.  We ruined them.  ---  So, well, . . . I'll feel
bad if it all caves in on us, yeah, but--- there may
be civilizations/cultures that'll come later, as
unimaginable to us as ours to the Creek.


I own one Arabic music casette: Om Khalsoum (sp.?),the
most popular singer in the world, more popular than
Elvis was, than ABBA.  I played it last weekend,
windows always shut dust allergy air-conditioning
(dust opened) opened wide.  Hadn't heard it in years.
Sounded beautiful.  There's this curious ~stoppage~
that occurs in that Arabic music: the melodic line
instantaneously seizes and lurches to a brief halt,
then continues forward, at perhaps a modification of a
half-step (?).

Zuz', did you order that copy of Jackie's "Best
Loved"?  Today's the release date.  I think it would
be nice to read a few poems by Jacqueline Bouvier
Kennedy Onassis.


When The Towers were originally erected --- mid- to
late-'70s, I guess --- all the earth that was
displaced by digging the hole for the foundations was
moved off toward the Hudson shoreline, and a small,
man-made (temporary?) "beach" was created.  There was
an open air series run there for a while, called "Art
on The Beach."  The newspaper The Village Voice ran an
article that I've never forgotten:

Australian aborigines were brought to the US. They
were taken to the ex nihilo beach for an Art on The
Beach to do a performance of their "dances."

It was very exciting to scholars and everyone that
here were these pristinely untouched tribesmen.  They
were living neolithics who had ~literally~ just
stepped out of The Stone Age (outback, forest).  The
newspaper played it up big, the angle that here were
these people brought directly out of 40,000 B.C. by
silver jet to dance at the base of the world's new
tallest building, in the shadow of The Towers.  Museum
curators removed Stone Age artefacts from vitrines to
show the aborigines, ask them what they meant to them.

There was one particular petroglyph carved in rock.
It showed a circle will concentric lines leading
inward, like a wheel with spokes.  Historians had
conjectured that it might've been a solar disk, an
ideogram for the sun.  They asked the aborigines what
it said to them.

It's a meeting of tribesmen, they said, all sitting in
a circle with their staffs pointed toward the center,
tips touching.

But, here's the point:

Being neolithic and nomadic, they had no sense
~whatsoever~ of personal possession.  One couldn't
~own~ anything.  (That's why graves provide evidence
of Stone Age life, filled with Venuses of Willendorf,
Cycladic mothers, stuff: rather than proof of belief
in an afterlife--- once somebody died, nobody ~wanted~
anybody else's s--t, and they just dumped their
hoardings like garbage into the hole where the body
went.

There was one thing, though, which they could own:

a dance.

No one except the owner of a singular dance could do
that dance.  It could not be stolen, sold, or given
away in life.

Upon the death of a father, the son who had seen it
practiced could then do the dance.

And the dances were of such phenomenal simplicity that
they were sometimes difficult for Westerners to
recognize as having even ~happened,~ danced to
completion before their eyes.  Such as, I remember,
"The Bear":

The dancer stood very seriously, flat-footed, weight
evenly distributed.  He took one step forward,
transferring his weight onto the sole of that foot.

Done.


The "dance," more than choreography per se, was like
the "duende" that Lorca writes about in flamenco
dancers, I guess, not only its motions but an
attitude,or elan, about doing the dance, "The Bear,"
the self-consciousness of possessing something.

The Australian aborigines danced at the base of The
Twin Towers at its inauguration.

Dear All,

I'm fully aware that calls for monetary support, whatever the cause, are
not what this list is for but, given the times......I just received the
message below on the RAWA (Revolutionary Association of Women in
Afghanistan) supporters e-list, from Steve Penners of the Afghan Women's
Mission - it seems extra traffic is causing web site problems for RAWA
- best kind of bad news I guess - they need help specifically to keep
the intro page up - the AWM are a great bunch who run many RAWA benefits
on the West Coast - i.e. they're totally legit - I think help for RAWA
at this time, particularly when its focused on raising awareness, is
something small that can be done...

many thanks for reading this, and the below,
Rob Holloway.




Steve Penners writes:-

Their (RAWA's) site is down due to phenomenal levels of traffic.  They
are three times over their limit and their ISP has turned them off until
someone commits to paying the potential bill.  I've been talking to them
all morning and looks like the bill will be anywhere from $375 to $600
or more depending on traffic levels through month's end.

Some may have noticed that RAWA has corporate level sponsorship for
their web hosting.  You can see this by the URL "fancymarketing.com"
which appears when you browse their site.  If we did not have this
corporate help, we would be facing a huge ISP bill.  Nevertheless, we
still need the intro page on www.rawa.org and believe it or not, that
intro page along is getting hit so hard that traffic levels are three
times the monthly limit already. I cannot imagine what the traffic
levels must be on the corporate hosting company's web server.

It's likely that AWM will make the necessary commitment to get the site
back up shortly (waiting to hear from all concerned). Anyone who wants
to help RAWA with this important awareness raising tool can make a tax
deductible donation payable to SEE/Afghan Women's Mission. Indicate for
RAWA web site in your donation letter or on your check's memo.

Leonard Brink would caution us that the lunatic fringe always imagine =
themselves to be especially enlightened. He then proceeds to some =
special enlightenments from, who else but, Leonard Brink. Or if they are =
not special, but merely run-of-the-mill, why does he trouble us with =
them?  my trouble with common sense must be that it is so common, I =
can't sense it. Another of its problems is that if it really is common, =
it follows the line of the LCD. Surely we are doing what we can to =
enlighten, here, minds that would grow a little less common...or why =
speak at all, unless to bark panic or moo reassurance?=20
  Look, Leonard, if I blow up your army, and you then blow up mine, I =
shall need to recruit a second army, as shall you, and all will then =
proceed as before, etc.,etc. I realize my figure is a familiar one, but =
despite its use during the antiquated and undeclared war in Vietnam, =
which it helped halt, it bears repeating, in the hope that it will be =
the only thing repeated.
   But this is just to say that the truly lunatic, fringe or not, will =
repeat everything, a tit for every tat, and that I found your post, =
pardon my frankness, boring in its predictability.  I am sure you can do =
better than that.=20
  I realize,too,that you will have heard this in the antiquated past,  =
but we have never been here before. We may think we have, but that is =
the trouble with thinking, v. Blake's "Mental Traveller". It is also the =
error through which wars are lost, and I feel sure that neither you nor =
I want us to lose the next one.
  Sincerely, David B.

though i do find it interesting that this question of "american"-ness never
seemed to be a problem when "american" poetry was discussed. political
nationalism is a problem, but poetic nationalism isn't?

DEEP SOUTH FESTIVAL OF WRITERS, OCT. 18-21, 2001

We are pleased to announce a tentative schedule for the Deep
South Festival of Writers, one of the oldest and most
prestigious literary conferences in the United States. Deep
South is a yearly event dedicated to affirming the value of
culture and the arts by providing public performances, panel
discussions, craft lectures, exhibitions and writing
workshops by a wide range of prominent artists from across
the nation.

This year's festival, our 41st annual event, will emphasize
live performances as never before, in a wide array of
genres--drama, poetry, the novel and short fiction,
nonfiction, folklore, music, and performance art. Our
featured writers (and also a number of guest visual artists
and musicians) will give readings and performances and
discuss their work in craft lectures and workshops. This
year's program includes nationally acclaimed novelist,
critic, and playwright Sarah Schulman, French poet Chris
Tysh, arts editor and poet George Tysh, New Orleans
playwright Mindy Mayer, and Pulitzer prize winning critic
Michael Dirda. (Please check them out at our website:

http://www.louisiana.edu/Academic/LiberalArts/ENGL/Creative/DeepSouth.htm.)

In addition, the festival will feature performances of two
original plays, Sarah Schulman's Correct Usage and Common
Errors (staged by UL-Lafayette's Theater Department under
the direction of Amy Waguespack) and Dayana Stetco's Milena,
Stripping, a dramatic reading of an original play by Mindy
Mayer (The Cool Sequester'd), a panel discussion detailing
the craft of editing magazines, journals, and poetry books,
a panel dedicated to Creative Writing Pedagogy, a panel
discussion of performance collaborations, and our yearly
"Poetry Crawl" (taking participants for a
reading/eating/drinking tour of Lafayette cafés and arts
venues).

This year's festival will take place in a multi-media,
multi-disciplinary performance environment featuring
collaborations among Louisiana writers, musicians, and
visual artists. Participants will include local writers Skip
Fox, Jerry McGuire, Burton Raffel, and Dayana Stetco, and
visual artists and musicians from this university and the
local community. We hope in addition to be able to present a
reading by our Distinguished Writer in Residence, Ernest
Gaines. As always, the festival will create lots of
opportunities for its audience to talk with all the
performers about these exciting ventures in collaborative
creativity. Most of the events will be staged at Fletcher
Hall, home of UL Lafayette's College of the Arts.

MICHAEL DIRDA is a writer and senior  editor for The
Washington Post Book World. He received the Pulitzer Prize
for Distinguished Criticism in 1993. His reviews or essays
appear  weekly, and address a broad range of interests:
classics in translation, intellectual history, children's
picture books, fantasy and crime fiction, biographies,
American and European literature, poetry, and innovative
writing of all kinds. In his monthly Readings column he
touches, light-heartedly (he hopes), on all kinds of bookish
matters--collecting modern firsts, rediscovering neglected
novels, the pleasures of ghost stories, the teaching of
writing and much else, most of it at least
semi-autobiographical.

Before joining Book World in 1978, Dirda taught world
literature at American University and George Mason
University, and worked as a free-lance writer, translator
and editor. Over the years he has contributed essays,
profiles and reviews to a variety of
publications--Smithsonian Magazine, Civilization, Encarta,
Connoisseur, The Chronicle of Higher Education, Collier's
Encyclopedia Yearbook, The Review of Contemporary Fiction,
etc. For three years he was a board member of the National
Book Critics Circle. He frequently conducts public
"conversations" with visiting writers for the Smithsonian
Institution , most recently with Booker Prize winner
Arundhati Roy, crime novelist Donald E. Westlake, and Gore
Vidal. He has also contributed biographical-critical essays
to scholarly volumes on detective fiction (John Dickson
Carr, Edmund Crispin) and science fiction and fantasy ("The
European Tradition in Supernatural Fiction," Jack Vance,
Maupassant).

He has written a short paperback, distributed by the Book of
the Month Club, called "Caring for Your Books,"and collected
some of his journalism in "Readings: Essays and Literary
Entertainments" (Indiana University Press). Other book
projects are also in the works. In 1995 Dirda received a
Washington Post/Duke University Fellowship, and in 1997 he
was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters from Washington
College, Chesterfield, Maryland. In 1999 he was a visiting
master artist in literary journalism at the Atlantic Center
for the Arts in New Smyrna Beach. During the fall term of
1999 he was the Distinguished Visiting Honors Lecturer at
the University of Central Florida.

Dirda is married to art conservator Marian Peck Dirda. They
live, with their three sons, in Silver Spring, Maryland in a
house filled with too many books. At Deep South he will give
a reading and take part in panels on editing (with Burton
George Tysh) and on translation (with Burton Raffel).


GEORGE TYSH--From 1965 to 1973, George Tysh lived in Paris,
France, where he co-edited Blue Pig (1968-72, with poet
David Ball), a journal of modern poetry. From 1965 to 1979,
he published five collections of poetry, most notably
Mecanorgane, Shop/Posh, and Tea.

In 1974-75, he came back to Detroit, where he originated and
hosted "Dimension," a late-night program on WDET-FM, which
combined spoken word and music sequences. In 1979 he
returned to Detroit and was awarded a National Endowment of
the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship, and became associated
with the Detroit Institute of Arts, where for 11 years
(1980-91) he coordinated the LINES: New Writing program and
also produced LINES Radio, a 13-part spoken word series for
National Public Radio which made some of the most exciting
LINES readings available to a national audience.

From 1984 to 1990, along with his wife (poet Chris Tysh) he
directed In Camera, a press which published collections of
postmodern poetry and a journal, Everyday Life. He returned
to the English Department/W.S.U. to complete a graduate
degree (M.A.) in film studies and theory which he received
in 1991. In the following year, he joined the faculty of the
English Department as a lecturer, teaching primarily film
courses from 1992 to 1997. Then in 1997, he accepted a
position as Arts Editor with the Metro Times, Detroit's
alternative newspaper.

His most recent collections of poetry include Ovals
(Detroit: In Camera, 1985) and Echolalia (New York: United
Artists, 1992), the first two parts of a
soon-to-be-completed trilogy; and Dream Sites: A Visual
Essay (Ferndale & Bloomfield Hills, MI: Past Tents Press &
Cranbrook Art Museum, 1998). He has given readings of his
work at such popular poetry venues as New Langton Arts in
San Francisco, The Poetry Project in New York City,
Milwaukee's Woodland Pattern, and Just Buffalo in Buffalo,
NY, as well as at Brown University, the Cranbrook Art
Museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts, Macomb Community
College, SUNY-Buffalo, the University of Michigan, and Wayne
State University, among many others. He has also been
invited to give talks on poetry and art at the California
Institute of the Arts, the Cranbrook Academy of Art, and The
Poetry Project in New York City. In addition to his poetry
reading, he'll take part in our Deep South panel of editors.



SARAH SCHULMAN--Sarah Schulman is a New York playwright and
fiction writer. Her books include: The Child, Shimmer, Rat
Bohemia, Empathy, People in Trouble, Girls, Visions, and
Everything, After Delores, and The Sophie Horowitz Story.
Her plays include: The Child, Correct Usage and Common
Errors, Freud Was My Co-Pilot; Playyy!, Cousine Better, Made

nearly time for bed, hoping it won't be my last
thought I'd take in the news first

the russians, and we always knew they were regular guys in the hands of an
evil international web devoted to the destruction of our way of life, now
freed are willing to channel arms to the other lot or one of them in
Afghanistan

while it is becoming more and more explicit that the US govt aim is to
destabilise the regime in Kabul regardlesss of having evidence against Bin
Laden (which they still do not seem to have finished writing and which they
won't show anyone in Kabul anyway)

or that's it according to BBC

well, pardon me, but isn't that why Afghanistan is in the state it's in?
with scarcely one brick on top of another, most of them dying and the whole
place possibly an advertisement for the supposed sanity of suicide warfare
because other more powerful countries - the same countries - despite the
fact that they have poverty, crime and decay within their own borders - take
it on themselves to engineer the course of history in the land of perceived
inferior races - despite the clear evidence that *every time they try it
they get it wrong and create a bigger mess than they started with

before it was USA and USSR fighting each other by proxy in Afghanistan; now
they're fighting a civil war together with their hands up the parties on one
side like their glove puppets, despite the mess they made and are still
making in Jugoslavia with UCK

No one in either country, USA / USSR, is in any doubt now what it means to
see people die; it's happened in their own capitals. Is it really
appropriate to help others go through the same thing? Politics as
cock-fighting

I've got a bush in my garden. I am willing to donate it. It's not much on
leadership, but I see that as a quality.

Do you honestly expect "the wisest"
answers to come from the 92% mob?
C'mon.  Old answers, sure.

Points well-taken. But I think the barn door closed behind that one a long
time ago: in the US "god," like the flag and all the patriotic songs, has
been coopted by the right.

Even in the section of Bush's speech dedicated to protecting US Moslems
this was in evidence. Moslems pray to Allah, not god. Maybe Bush and his
handlers don't know that allah is merely Arabic for god, or maybe they feel
it's still necessary to portray Moslems as exotic Other.

Bin Laden is only marginally relevant to "our" problem. Out of the billion
or so people who feel they have reason to dislike us there are more than a
few potential suicide bombers. Some of them are even nice to women and
scientists. Some of them are women. Some of them are atheists. All of them
are "our" problem.

Hi all, excuse the generation post, please. That was some twisted topical
kneejerk notation of an essay I had been working on about the "younger"
poets vav the Language school -- having to do with things I've heard about
the olders not thinking (seeing) we're engaged. But it's all blown away now
by the current events.
Michael Magee, I take your points on both issues. I know irony & apathy
ain't the same; sorry if I seemed to conflate em.
My best to one and all -
Elizabeth

According to an email from my father, my brother Jim, a NYC ironworker who
has been at the WTC since the 11th, will tomorrow (Sept. 25), with another
person whose name I don't know, ring the opening bell at the NYSE.

What a curious thing.

Wystan, that was a wonderful remark that I am sure yr fathert would
like, re age's running out of patience. That is the best kid's

On CNN, during one of their evening "town meetings" (this one focused on
college students from around the country), footage of at least five or six
peace demonstrations at various universities.  Don't know how much coverage,
otherwise, has been aired, if it is enough to satisfy, but the demonstrations
were reported and discussed with students both on campus site and in the
studio.  Student responses, as you might imagine, defined the political
spectrum.  Best, Bill

In "American" poetry, are you including Pablo Neruda and Anne Carson?
Or do you mean US Poetry? I also get confuded when the Lakers are
referred to as the "World" champions.

Yes, Ron, and the 2.5 years that the English and Canadians etc. were
fighting Hitler before the US got in. We were glad they did. It is
true that the US ww2 started with Pearl. But it was only one of many
starting points. And really, the WTC wasn a starting point, either.
The concept of a starting point, is, when you think about it, a
dangerous notion. It can be used to give justification for
retaliation. Aw, Mom, HE started it, etc.

Dear Listees, I'm sharing this note / e-mail I wrote to an informal group of poets and artists (11 eleven of us here in NYC gravely effected by last week's occurrence, who plan on meeting fairly regularly for a while) as a way of sharing with you some possible points of departure for cultural work within the peace movement.

The communication here is very context-specific (involving many problematics lumping one on the other), and so many of the referents might not be fully detectable.  Also, it does not even *partially* capture the richness of these New Yorker Poets and Artists thoughts as they expressed them the other night (our first meeting). Yet, I hope some of these thoughts on the lanugage of "protest" may be of use.

[[the double brackets indicate something added for this post only]]


"Hi everyone.  Much of what I heard last night has helped me get a grip on the tremendous variety of thoughts and responses that people are having to what occurred on September 11, 2001.  I look forward to more meetings between us.

One thing that excited me was that the words / phrases pasted onto signs need not be anything at all resembling *any* current slogans in *any* way, both in length and word choice (Kristin, and Betsy).

[[also, song, dancing, as well as silence are already coming into play]]

*Maximum imagination*
That is, that you can have "a thousand plateaus" and still be effective (if not more so even) which might be the reasoning (as I understand it) behind our first Thursday night intervention [[posting handfulls of poems at Union Square]]

Yet, for the slogans (sound-byte length ones) that are out there already (at these demos), a *critique* of them still interests me very much, especially if these (our) collective critiques [[a sub-working group of a cultural-education working group within a coalition]] inform (funnel up into) the workings of the coalition *as a whole*

I had actually written this before our meeting and planned on handing it out [see attached], but resisted in the interest of furthering the organic form the group was taking as regards "coordinated action" [something that should be questioned in and of itself]"

*

[Draft for]

"Effective" Slogans, that:

Preserve the moment somehow (the tragedy, the emotions, deep concerns, sometimes as yet unarticulated: the "ground zero-ness" of it all).

That the slogans not come from (speak to) some moment before it (historically, 9-11) however right we may be about the content leading up to that moment (we are not a mini-lecture series on wheels)

That the slogans leave room enough for what might happen next, that they be adaptable enough to adjust if needed.

Slogans that:
Draw people out.  That encourage them to stand up and join in.  That unify people.  That signal the difficulty in doing so even (especially at this time, so pitched as it is with hasty saber-rattling).  Slogans that don't put us apart from others around us (sometimes even the people that act hostile toward us).  That the affect, the gesture, and the content should be carefully examined  in the interest of appeal, thoughtfulness, or sudden (ideo-effective) surprise. In a language that's easy to understand (*or* not).   In a language that can't (as much as possible) be manipulated (impossible to do, in the end, yet, at *varying degrees*)

"No Justice, No Peace!"
It should be fairly obvious to us here that however apt the slogan has been for other struggles (and very worthy ones at that), is not apt here at all.  So with many other slogans.  We should examine them for maximum effectivity.  Effectivity=non-isolation, non-isolating, non-stasis.  Sectarian self-reflexivity is something that ails us all on some level.  To extirpate it (asap).

We're not trying to re-convince ourselves (for the upteenth time) of many of the principals we believe in and sometimes (though imperfectly) live by.  In fact, we're not "a we", ever yet, but a dynamic (in process) burgeoning Consensus against Death and Violence in all its forms.

Things we are having to defend ourselves about (already):

1. That, we are "do nothings"

Slogans like "declare peace" (and this is my opinion only) (however much I share the sentiment) might seal that opinion.  It is a justifiable thing to say and feel, but it seems too broad for the moment [a point of discussion no doubt], as well as being anchored by a "practical" eternity of some kind.   Not everybody out there (unfortunately) is a peacenik (yet).  [I'd say it's a problem of ideological transport potential]

2. That, we (as demonstrators) are "the same people as always (out there)," the (supposed or alleged) &#8216;usual suspects&#8217;" and that we are "out of touch" somehow with the current mood of the nation (or even the city)

What good is it, then, to start up a raucous round of "Who&#8217;s streets? Our streets!" (a chant from the Seattle-Washington-Quebec-Goteburg-Genoa sequence of demos) in front of municipal workers, or relatives of those workers (as well as relatives and friends of the victims) many of whom lay buried, or are still having to pick through the rubble for body parts.

Folks (that is, "in" or bestride the Coalition) it's show time! This (movement) is also theater.  Why else march to Times Square?  And not be prepared, slogan-wise (for the whole world press no less).

One hundred rounds of "hey hey's-ho ho's" mark us as those "usual suspects" by distancing us away (again by going backwards, as regards cultural forms) from what is (still) very much a gut-level fear, sadness, and mixed resolve that people are feeling...a resolve, toward *something*.  It's that "something" that we're after. Here. Today. And tomorrow. Full-Shiftable.

We must make differentiations with (and banking off) the "unity" theme / sentiment that surrounds us and dominates us.  Making differentiations does not mean ditching a direct-response either (though an indirect response is certainly needed too)

e.g.
Should we be transfixed (in public) by Bush per say, as in a death-clutch / agony, through slogans that are almost personal-sounding? (however much we feel them to be "true" about "him" (and his retinue) *off* camera?)

A slogan (I penned off-the-cuff at Times Square):

"For a lasting and (just) peace, the other ground zero"

might be a clumsily-worded slogan, but perhaps it contains the elements of an equitable idea / practice (that preserves the moment).  In short, it needs work.  As technicians of the word, poets, and cultural workers in general, we very much can and should enter into this burgeoning peace (justice) movement, to help shape it, and transform it.

chris,
     this also refers to your previous message but I think we here have not
really absorbed the real impact of the event which is that America is
vulnerable. trama victims' initial responses often are mixed, to say the
least, and include rage, fear, bluster, teddy bears, and a lot of other
elements.   I think possibly this event is our opportunity to join the rest
of the world and transend stereotypes from the past, given a little
understanding.

i wonder if it's occurred to anyone else that the ~90% "for military
action" vs. ~10% "against" (u.s.) polls might be a highly artificial
stat?... that, if those polled were provided with background and
options, we might well find that some percentage of u.s. citizens
(25%?  i'm being optimistic), a portion of the 90 AND the 10 (a
little boolean logic here), would prefer international police action
to outright war...

to those of you who refuse to yield to what's rightly (i think)
perceived as a warlike stance on the part of the u.s. govt:  i'd
respond that i refuse to yield myself both to said warlike stance AND
to the idea that the u.s. should be sitting on its hands...
please---i'm not straddling any fences, and certainly few on this
list (i daresay) have the tactical/strategic wherewithal (in military
terms per se) to argue down the notion that some limited
commando-type operation(s) (FOR EXAMPLE) might be both workable and
necessary at the moment (and result in zero civilian casualities),
with some sort of international legal resolution in the offing...

i *do* understand, too, that there are generational issues at work in
what's being advocated hither & thither... not simply so, of course,
but still... i mean, my mother was a refugee in france, courtesy of
national socialism... and that of course has something to do with why
i feel the way i do (though again---not simply so)...

anyway, in light of what i suggested earlier re questions:  is it
necessary, finally, to reproduce the "you're either with us or agin
us" logic of bush jr. *here*?...

i'm not asking a rhetorical question this time either, and i'm not
"accusing" everyone or anyone of everything and anything... i'm
picking up here on a certain tension that, well, i find unproductive,
given that (i would asssume, i would hope) my differences with ALL of
you folks (and probably even with, shit, bush jr.) are much less,
finally, than my differences with someone like bin laden, the folks
who crashed the planes, tim mcveigh, etc.... i don't mean to erect a
radical alterity (please!), but i *do* mean to lay out some
provisional grounds for collective social action...

thanx to *all* for your thoughts & convictions...

peace,

Hi Jerrold, yes

nationalism is a problem

and the proof that it is

is given by the facts that

it is being strongly contested

(although in differing ways and to varying effects) by:

globalism

translocalism

regionalism

decentralisation

unionism

separatism

terrorism

networking

. . .

and i'm not suggesting that they are in any way inter-related btw, but that
nationalism is one pressing vortex through which these challenges to its
formations, which are now well overdue a thorough examination, pass

it might be reified, but right now it is being contested

who said that chat about American poetry was ok and not American politics?
I've always balked at this representation of a large continent through one
nation state's sloppy rhetoric  -  much as i enjoy the slippage of
rhetorical ambitions. Now if we're talking 'poetries of the Americas'
that's a different story.

love and love
cris

and i'm not suggesting as i already mentioned that United Kingdom is any
the more acceptable or less problematic. These questions might seem a
little down the line, but

why you haven't heard from me, because i am in miami
and as far as i can see, there are no protests, and i
don't say much on the street because the right-wing's strong,
and at the university there's salsa dancing and not much else,
one of the students thought the terrorists were 'faggots,'
which seemed to go over well, i was told that the word's ok,
because they use it all the time in spanish. so i
try to survive by typing furiously and making what work i can,
but the debate - i want to be there participating in new york,
i got myself into this fix, i talk to people here all i can,
it means nothing, the sun's hot, lizards everywhere, radio's
filled with soppy jingoism far to the right of limbaugh,
we're americans, it's frustrating we just can't nuke them,
most of us would like to go to war even if it resulted in us
casualties, do you honestly trust your next-door neighbor,
i sleep hardly at all. it's a foreign land, it's heartland
rubbed raw in repetition, i want to apologize for my meaningless
life of self-indulgence, i want to do something that matters,
i forward uselessly, sign occasional petitions (there are 100s
and i don't think they matter much), i don't think the lists
make much of a difference, i think there are evil men who
think like miami out there, they're taking us towards far
worse hells, raise our fists, they're charred

this is just stupidity, decadent opinion, the perversity of

I agree in principle with this Scott: on this List is a good sign of a real
debate going on in the U.S. and evrywhere as against a knee jerk support of
"one side or other". The problems are complicated. Its easy (for me at leat)
to get paranoid about all this. This morning I got a phone call: it was an
American voice "Is that Baxter?" "No ..I think you have the wrong number."
"Oh, ok, my apologies" said the American.(Obviously(?)  an FBI or CIA agent
checking me out!! After all wasnt the poet Baxter (contemporary of Allen
Curnow) (and I dont think he was referring to the comic or "Visual Novelist"
personage) a left-leaning "communist-lapsed-catholic-liberal" ?!!)   I agree
with marches against war and disagree with Perloff's analysis. (Mind you I'd
be scared of getting beaten up or shot even - especially - in Auckland). The
terrorist attacks come any way: a better thing to do would be to debate eg
"what actually is terrorism?"  "Is it ever justified?" "Why did these
attacks occur?" and so on. Which is indeed happening. But unfortuanately the
right wing never want debate.They equate dissent with "socialism" or
whatever. This is classic paranoia: the pilot that advocated action by the
people on the aeroplane is quite right: that is the way anyone is ever
goping to fight terrorism or for their own life. The individual and
together.  It has shown that with all the US's enormous military might and
spending it (and everyone in the world in fact) are helpless against a
determined terrorist or politically motivated attack: whether that attack is
justified or not. In some ways that is a good sign for a large "Evil Empire"
can be beaten by Luke Skywalker etc:  I believe in The Force.
  Exactly why it occrred is a mystery. But certain US and British and other
Western policies havent helped. More information needs to be known about the
background to the Middle East politics: the often wrongful treatment of the
Palestinians AND the stupid blanket hatred of Jews by Arabs: the endless
"them or us" attitudes. The enormous power and also the great goodness of
the US creates its opposite: a corresponding "evil".  We are arrogant to
hold up Western democracy as the "only way" and so on. Israel feels
(sometimes rightly) that they are threatened by barbarous forces: the
Palestinians have had some wrongfulness. Iraq has done some stupid things
and the response to them was rather "over the top"....but a military strike
against Afghanistan is stupid. The resources of the West should be diverted
to educate and assist other nations and this needs to involve ALL nations:
including Pakistan and all the "non democratic" countries...the UN doesnt
seem to be very strong. They seem to be merely puppets of the US. Of course
there are a lot of crazy people around but the terrorist attacks have always
come from within a nation...or as near as. McVeigh operated more or less on
his own and was trained (and brain washed?) by the US Military.  Perloff is
completely (completely ?) wrong: if the US is to be immolated because people
exercise freedom of speech that is better than being immolated for trying to
"impose" freedom or to "free the world of terrorism"  (during which process
you will have to shut down "feedom of speech"!!A "War against terrorism" why
not a "War againgst  `p' " or a "War against Neurasthenia" ?  "Nothing comes
from nothing"   War generates war. Kill Bin Laden and you probably create
hundreds more...and so on...If he's hehind this: bring him to trial. Let
justice be seen to be done..and so on.
  Do something serious about the enormous social and finacial inequalities
in the world. Bring about a truly democratic world. The struggle is endless.
Bugger it, I cant write poetry or read books while this is going on:
although I have been reading C Bernstein's essays in "A Poetics":  they are
very astute and strangely "calming" and stimulating to read (and I am a
great enthusiast for Marjorie Perloff's poetics notwithstanding what I say
above - her response is understandable to this: I can see why and where
she's coming from - this is a terrible tragedy we have here).  Richard.

to clarify a small point here.  as a mail list message i did bristle at your
response here, George, but were we sitting in a tavern in Mexico I would
hope we would have ended toasting a new America?

there does seem to be a general assumption on the list that the flag I had
my kids buy was a post-vietnam one but it had echoes of one painted on the
side of a plane my father sent me from England in 43.  I had them buy it for
my granddaughter who I hope will grow up with a better flag than we now
have.

As for me, I always thought of the flag as transitional phenomena and
intermediate space in respect of moving from one country to another.

Does anyone remember the burning of the Reichstag?  Perhaps not.

Or when people once thought the Soviets killed Kennedy?

Or what really happened with the Gulf of Tonkin incident?

No one believes the "accepted truths" about these and many other incidents
that have been used to construct an unprecedented illusory truth.  Or as a
certain acquaintance of mine says, "the bigger the lie, the easier it is to
believe."

At one time people believed the alleged Communist Marinus Van Der Lubbe
burned down the Reichstag alone in 1933.  It later turned out that Hitler
and his pals (esp. Goering) made it look that way in order to eliminate the
Communists from the upcoming election.  Soon Hitler was no longer some
democratically elected Chancellor but a dictator, the Fuhrer of Germany, and
he closed the Reichstag altogether.  Seig Heil?

Once upon a time in a place called USA its president was shot, and everyone
blamed the Communists.  And then a Government-appointed committee of
"professionals", without producing any compelling evidence, seconded that
"facile" conclusion.  In 2001, almost no one any longer buys the Warren
Commission load.  Take a poll on that one.  It's simply a completely
untenable theory that the Soviets did it.  There was little if nothing they
stood to gain and so much that they stood to lose.  Yet I'm sure that at
least 92% of Americans thought it was the Soviets in November 1963.

In 1962 it was widely reported that the North Vietnamese attacked US
Warships in the Tonkin Gulf.  The attack never actually happened.  Three
days later, on the basis of the fabricated attack, the Gulf of Tonkin
Resolution which functioned in effect as a declaration of war against North
Vietnam passed in the Senate with only two dissenting votes. You are no
doubt familiar with the resulting Vietnam War, a war no one is even remotely
proud of.

Why did these things happen?

Because things sometimes ARE NOT AS THEY SEEM.

And people believe what they find will make their lives easier to live.


Unprofessionally,
Patrick

The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

An afternoon reading with
ALAN CHONG LAU  & SHIRLEY ANCHETA

Thursday afternoon September 27
4:30 pm, free
@ The Poetry Center, SFSU

presented in collaboration with
Asian American Studies, SFSU

Join us when celebrated poet Alan Chong Lau returns to California from
Seattle, joining his friend and fellow poet Shirley Ancheta for an
afternoon reading of their works at The Poetry Center.

ALAN CHONG LAU's early book of poetry, Songs for Jadina, won the American
Book Award in 1981.  His new book, Blues and Greens, subtitled "a produce
worker's  journal" -based on Mr. Lau's experiences working daily in an
Asian produce department in Seattle's international district-is new from
the University of Hawaii Press, published in association with UCLA Asian
American Studies Center.  "In this sensuous, often witty book," notes Gail
Tremblay, "one is struck from the first page onward with how completely
this poet lives a 'life considered.'  No one I know writes with more
sensitivity about the nature of life and work than Alan Lau, and few poets
explore so honestly the nature of living in a community with others who
have had to live complex and difficult lives."  Also a visual artist, Mr.
Lau has illustrated this volume throughout  with his ink drawings and sumi
paintings.

SHIRLEY ANCHETA co-edited the poetry anthology Without Names (Kearny Street
Workshop, San Francisco), one of the first such collections by Filipino
American poets.  Her work has appeared in numerous magazines and
anthologies, including Bamboo Ridge, Quarry West, and Premonitions: the
Kaya Anthology of Asian North American Poetry.  A regular book review
contributor to the Pacific Reader in Seattle, she lives in Watsonville,
California, and works as an English instructor at Cabrillo College, in
Aptos.  With Jeff Tagami, Al Robles, and others, she recently presented a
program titled "Watsonville Stories" at the San Francisco Public Library.

Today we stand at the edge of a large cliff, ready to leap off the edge into
an unknown darkness.  Many of us find ourselves no longer able to resist the
temptation to solve our problems with military might; even some of the most
left of us are arching our feet getting ready to dive headlong into the
darkness of war.  There seems no stopping people from jumping off; history
painfully jabs us with this sharp reminder over and over again, that we are
doomed to make this same murderous mistake over and over and over again.
Most if not all of the experts and leaders from all political positions have
already leapt.  The US economy is screaming, and many of our own livelihoods
is in danger.  Every one of us was hurt in some way.  Some people suggest
war is the only way to protect our livelihoods, to save the economy from
tumbling down it's own invisible staircase.  But for those of you who have
not yet leapt into the molten fires of the desire for war, hold on a moment.
I want to talk about absurdity, truth, justice, murder, money, and
democracy.  I want you to consider some harsh realities, and I want you to
make decisions where the truth is self-evident.

Advocating any sort of military or intelligence solution (as in acts of war
or an increase in intelligence spending) to the US's crisis at hand sets a
whole new standard for absurdity.  Yes, absurd.  War is not only a poor
solution, it is no solution at all.   Neither is padding the pockets of an
already totalitarian-minded secretive elite with a long criminal history.
Yet that's what I seem to be hearing from everywhere, from the right, the
left, the TV, and the infotainers on NPR, that we can only respond with war,
with espionage, with more money to the CIA, to the DIA, to the NSA, and to
the US Military.  Such recommendations are not only non-solutions.  The
so-called "solutions" promise to only amplify the cycle of violence while
extending the impoverishment and exploitation of the citizens of the world,
in the US and beyond.  The war will spread like burning jet fuel, extending
the violence well beyond the circles of Lower Manhattan, rural Pennsylvania,
and the Pentagon.

The attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon was indeed an attack
on the people of the United States.  Many US citizens died horrible and
unjust deaths, as did many across the globe.  It was an attack on people of
the United States and people across the world.  These deaths make many
people like you and me angry, and, rightfully so.  We must surely accept our
anger, but we also have a responsibility to honor those fellow lost
travelers to seek truth and justice, however evasive those concepts may
seem.  Truth.  Justice.  We must be brave, show courage and resolve so that
we may respect the lives of all people who deserve that respect, and so that
we may honor the lives lost in the apocalypse in Manhattan, southern
Pennsylvania, and the Pentagon.

The attack was carried out in a way that rendered many possible US Military
responses impotent.  The US Military is for the most part a hierarchical
bureaucracy where even operational decisions must be passed down a chain of
command.  It is painfully apparent that the attackers operated rather
independently of any large organization for an extended period of time.
There was no doubt a central body for training and for giving the fateful
order, but those cells ran their own operations.  The arms of a giant are
too slow and coarse in swinging at barely visible and distributed small
attackers.

The arms of the US Military beast are much too coarse, unless those
operations come from US Special Ops.  US Special Ops are the only units in
the US Military trained to act in a decentralized and independent fashion.
Special Ops will suffer no disadvantages against a decentralized opponent,
not only in terms of force, but also in terms of independent operational
decisions and intelligence gathering.  The US Delta Force will be on the
front line and they will not fail to hit their targets.  The US is nowhere
near incapable of waging a "modern" war.  The US and its Delta Force are the
"bleeding edge" of military response technology and problem solving.

What does that mean for us?  What we are about to witness is a covert war, a
war where no person will ever hear a shred of truth, a war where our
dishonest justice will be rendered empty.  Quite frankly, covert war is not
war but terrorism.  The sort of terrorism that allows the CIA to train bin
Laden how to convince, recruit, brainwash (take your pick) people and make
them ready to die in the name of Islam, to teach this man how to use
religion as a tool for control.  The sort of terrorism that bin Laden passed
to the Kosovo Liberation Army, whose skills the US government rewarded with
large sums of money, the organization in tight with bin Laden and The sort
of terrorism that makes it OK for the CIA to enrich someone like bin Laden
at least through the end of 1999, when the KLA and Al Qaieda partnered with
the CIA to make many dollars at the expense of the Serbian civilian
population.

That's right--the US Government KNOWINGLY pumped Osama bin Laden's
organization with cash in 1999, despite that he was already a state enemy.
And bin Laden's training of the KLA allowed the US to take Serbia and
Kosovo.  And now Kosovo is known as perhaps a pure narco-state.  Is that
progress?  If this does not sound Orwellian to you, I recommend you read
_1984_ again.  Orwell's world in _1984_, however, is nowhere nearly so bleak
or convoluted.  It does, however, smell the same.

To follow the bogus and unsubstantiated calls to over-modernize the US's
military and its intelligence services, to make them able to respond to such
rhizomatic terrorist organizations (which they already are capable of) would
require that US leaders:

  *  pump even more money into dark corners of US military
     already receiving hundreds of billions of dollars a year,

  *  distance US citizens even more from all supposedly
     "democratic" processes, and

  *  place more and more US civil liberties at risk.

The truth is, these organizations already are the very vanguard of all
violent problem-solving.  No one's talking about those groups in any
realistic terms because talking heads on every trusted media outlet are
illustrating their desires to help the powerful get more power.  After all,
it seems the only thing their flapping gums are good for.  The powerful want
more power and are willing to exploit your suffering, your compassion, your
desire to make the world a better place.  they're not about to tell the
public anything about how things work behind closed door.  Many of them are
chosen to speak either because they know and have incentive not to tell, or
they simply do not have a clue but want to sound like they know something.

The attacks on the WTC and the Pentagon comprised a murderous act of
aggression against all people, mostly US citizens.  It happened on US soil,
in our backyards.  Friends and loved ones lost their lives, their homes, and
we watched suffering flood an entire country.  The death toll and physical
devastation are perhaps reminiscent only of war, sure.  The losses were
beyond our own imaginary limits for infamy.  It is tempting indeed to call
these attacks war and to unleash the might and massive machinery that US
Citizens have labored so hard to provide for our own security, for the
safety of our homes, our families, our friends, our communities, and our
ideals.  So many Americans seem ready to place the lives of their sons and
daughters on the line to swing at an unseen enemy.

But what is an act of war?  An act of war implies an organization's *overt*
effort to effect international policy.  It is an effort by the offending
organization to make known that it can act in a violent way to change how
organizations and states operate.  It is perhaps the most brutal form of
negotiation.  However, no one has admitted guilt.  No one.  There's no one
else at the negotiating table.  There is nothing overt about the organizers
of the attack.  No organization is making itself known as players in the
role of aggressor.  Let us not be misled by either the rhetoric of
opportunistic politicians or the scale of devastation.  The attacks do not
comprise some act of war.  There is no one standing up and saying what he,
she, or they want.  We have only silence.

To move even one step in the direction of strengthening the US Military or
US Government intelligence services by spending increases will only prove to
strengthen the exploitation of people both inside and outside US borders.
To move in the direction of a military response to the attack will
underscore a dangerous misunderstanding of the secrecy of the attack.  To
move in the direction of security and violence, to mistake the clearly
covert attack for an overt act of war, will simply add to the pile of bodies
and pump energy into already massive cycle of violence across our globe.

War is a violent form of communication.  When we see the horrible message of
the WTC towers collapsing, there's no one admitting to having sent it.  This
is not an act of war, however masive its impact is, but instead a criminal
act on a scale we never before even imagined.  The perpetrators are
criminals.  Their only purpose is to wreak destruction and make us full of
fear, to cause us to lash out in such a predictably coarse and ineffective
way.

If anything, the US should be looking into improving its cooperative efforts
internationally to take preventative actions against all criminal
organizations hell-bent on killing US Citizens.  To seek justice, the US
must discover the truth about who organized and carried out the attack to
the very last detail.  Every citizen must keep it in his or her best
interest to help bring this person to justice.  We already know whoever did
it is secretive and "moves through shadows;" we must be willing to roll back
the mist and consider every possibility, no matter how unbelievable, every
motive, every theory, until we discover the complete truth.

While we are seeking the parties responsible, leaving no stones unturned, we
must also make sure the more vulnerable and dangerous elements of our
industrial society are safe.  That includes not just aircraft but also
nuclear reactors and industrial production plants of all sorts.  The
destruction of any one of many different chemical plants, for example, could
do more harm to the US and its people than what we witnessed that gruesome
Tuesday.  Consider for a moment if one of those planes crashed into a
nuclear reactor the horrors we would now be discussing.

Firing artillery at a swarm of bees is ineffective in preventing people from
bee stings.  The swarm easily evades the relatively large and ungainly
attack.  In real terms, such an act of violence bleeds the resources of US
citizens while lining the pockets of those selling weapons to the US
Government.  That's the only benefit such actions are going to provide:
someone's going to get rich.  What's worse is, the bees are going to come
back at you.  Such large gestures of military strength might make you feel
safe, but they only manage to increase your risk of being stung.  Worse, the
nurturing of war and military & intelligence budgets only increases your
risk of being the target of brutality far worse than any bee sting
imaginable.

Today the world is behind America for a change.  The people of the world are
looking to us as a possible home for truth and justice and freedom, a nation
willing to set a proud example, not a people of awkward and murderous
retribution or of blind support of murderous secretive and anti-democratic
organizations.  A country where its people believe not in doing to others
what it has already done to them, but doing to others as the people want for
themselves and their families today and forever.

Perhaps truth and justice may sound unattainable to the 21st century ear, or
may be completely drowned out by the barrage of half-truths floating out of
mouths everywhere.  Instead let us work to allow our ideals to prevail, not
our cynicism, not our fears.

I write to you this Monday evening, the 24rd Of September,
from the land of the FREE and the home of the BRAVE.

Patrick

Is this a poem Harry?  You could give them my name as a "dangerous"
terorist:  I purchased a plastic "robot arm" from a local $2.00 shop which I
thought might come in handy for something. (Am I thus a terrorist? Any way
the info may come in handy: the FBI might be paying!) I used it to imitate
an American supporter and shook a few peoples's hands: and I said: "You know
President Bush, youngfella?"  The boy nodded. "Well I'm his chief adviser -
I may look like a little fat man with glasses but dont be fooled. Shake
hands, you're either for me or against me". And the young fulla nodded and
as his parents laughed as he shook my $2.00 Taiwanese plastic hand at 3
(safe) feet distance. If I may say so Harry me old mate: that meeting
symbolised everything that is beautiful every where. drn.  Richard....drn.

Subject:      Analyzing the Flag
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Dear Nick: Thanks for the eloquent post. When I first saw flags coming out
after September 11, I correlated that with the (it turns out) more
aggressive display in the Gulf War. I also remember the half-time show of
the Super Bowl, an important cultural document which ought to be studied
for its object relations. In it, groups of children of servicemen were
trotted out on center stage,and there was virtually a sacrificial aspect to
the whole thing. "We" were to identify both with the child left behind
(perhaps permanently) and the parents doing their duty leaving the child
("who is us"). This identification of the child--held hostage by the adult
demands of uncompromising duty--with the potential space not of play but of
mourning has been reinforced in many ways since then. The Columbine High
School tragedy, as much as the Oklahoma bombing, is emblematic of the
way  the child is placed at the forefront of a process of mourning that is
also definitive of group identity.

I haven't seen that discourse invoked particularly, but it bears on the
question of the transitional object. The transitional object, as you know,
is primarily related to the question of separation and hence normal
development. It also is important in relation to traumatic experiences that
in some way interrupt the normal course of separating from the care-giving
parent. A signal use of the concept is to describe a space ("potential
space") in Winnicott's terms that is where play takes place. Winnicott sees
this as space of acting out, and the child can unload its destructive rage
in this safe space because really, the potential space is defined by the
presence not absence of the mother. This has enormous use in thinking about
art of all kinds. For instance, Mike Kelly uses teddy bears in some of his
pieces where he punches them out, shits on them. You could think of Jaspers
Johns's use of the flag, in that famous work where there are three of them
stacked on top of each other, as a playful acting out around the national
symbol. And because it's art (the context being the late 50s or early 60s)
it's OK. No one is going to accuse him of insulting the flag.

The concept is very intuitive and I think many can easily identify it.
Maria writes about her cat. I have my transitional object (or one of them)
sitting on a shelf--Mickey Mouse, c. 1950. But does that really work with
the flag? I'm trying to think how. I'm picturing the huge flag right next
to the hole at Ground Zero from a helicopter, on the TV news today. That's
the use we are thinking of.

Reaching for my psychoanalytic library, I find the following passage in
Winnicott:

"The object is a symbol of the union of the baby and the mother (or part of
the mother). This symbol can be located. It is at the place in space and
time where and when the mother is in transition from being (in the baby's
mind) merged with the infant and alternatively being experienced as an
object to be perceived rather than conceived of. The use of the object
symbolizes the union of two now separate things, baby and mother, at the
point in time and space of the initiation of their state of separateness.
[. . .] The mental representation [that results] in the inner world is kept
significant, or the imago in the inner world is kept alive, by the
reinforcement given through the availability of the external separated-off
and actual mother, along with her technique of child care. [Hence, the
mother is not dead in the creation of the object and its space.]

"It is perhaps worthwhile trying to formulate this in a way that gives the
time factor due weight. The feeling of the mother's existence lasts x
minutes. If the mother is away for more than x minutes, then the imago
fades, and along with this the baby's capacity to use the symbol of the
union ceases. The baby is distressed, but this distress is soon mended
because the mother returns in x + y minutes. In x + y minutes the baby has
not become altered. But in x + y + z minutes the baby has become
traumatized. in x + y + z minutes the mother's return does not mend the
baby's altered state. Trauma implies that the baby has experienced a break
in life's continuity, so that primitive defenses now become organized to
defend against a repetition of "unthinkable anxiety" or a return of the
acute confusional state that belongs to the disintegration of nascent ego
structure." ("The Location of Cultural Experience")

And Winnicott goes on to conclude that most babies don't experience x + y +
z. "This means that the majority of children do not carry around with them
for life the knowledge from experience of having been mad. Madness here
simply means a breakup of whatever may exist at the time of a personal
continuity of experience." In that situation, the child has a hard time
reintegrating.

I believe that's the model. It's distinct from Freud in "Mourning and
Melancholia," importantly because the parent is not dead. The object is not
lost, but the continuity of experience has become traumatic. That I think
is accurately what those of us who did not experience a direct loss have
just experienced. The continuity of our experience--sense of well being,
its protension and retention--has been disrupted. There is a before and
after, a traumatic shock.

A number of aspects of what we are observing bear on this model. Something
is holding it all together in the face of trauma. Does this mean the flag
posits a caring parent? That could be interesting in light of the Columbine
High School discourse--a way to translate child, parent, and community into
national identity. Then there are the questions of play and aggression.
When I see people in SUVs flying the flag where there once was a hockey
team flag (Detroit Red Wings), something of the playful use of an identity
symbol is suggested. But I can't get farther than that. As for aggression
of the Mike Kelley variety, I don't see that. Acting out on the flag
because it's safe.

What strikes me as important is the way that Winnicott infers that our
response to this circles back to the position of the child. And I think
that is a powerful political discourse. It also powerfully separates the
politics of nation states (and their aggressions) from the politics of
community (and their concerns with caring). Perhaps you can see by this
analysis that I think this is a terrible result. It separates, cordons off,
our basic instincts from the political arrangements that protect them. We
are all held hostage by forms of aggression that at any moment could
disrupt our lives.

So the flag. We could look at it this way, yes. We could look at it as an
identity symbol--that's my flag, I'm an American. And we could look at it
as a form of duty. Salute the flag and do your duty. I don't think it's
possible to dissociate any of these ways of seeing the flag. What is
remarkable at the present moment is the overwhelming sense that we have
been placed in the position of the child whose mother, a.k.a. sense of well
being that can't possibly "go away," has gone away. For the present time.
This is the x + y + z situation Winnicott discusses. The tragedy is that,
given the total destructiveness of great power politics and terrorist
responses, that is the only place for us.

I certainly did not mean to infer that concern for the human reality of the
trauma that has occurred is an apology for all that might be done in the
name of a national symbol. I also feel caught up in the same relation to
the trauma that occurred. I notice it because I perceive the flag, right
now, as more or less benign in precisely the way you and others have seen
it. But I also perceive in it an ominous masking of the other forms of
identity and disavowal that are to come.

Sounded beautiful. There's this curious ~stoppage~ that occurs in that

Hi Jeffrey,

Actually, Oum, Umm, Om, Omme, Kalthoum, Kalsuom, Kaltsoum, Kulthum & other
variations are all valid.

You mention that "brief halt"--there's almost a word for it, although I
think it has more to do with quality of voice: "Bahha," which means "a
quality of hoarseness or a break in the voice considered to be beautiful and
expressive." But, yeah, you can hear that "stoppage" in the instrumentation
as well. The composition is ordered and performed in such a way as to
heighten dramatic tension, and suspensions of various kinds, sudden shifts
(sometimes bizarre to western ears) of coloration/instumentation, brief
halts, and so on are all employed to create it. It was said that she never
sang a line the same twice, ever--and audiences frequently demanded that she
repeat a particular line or phrase in performance. The point being to reduce
your audience to a complete state of entrancement. (Is that a word?)
Probably, on the tape you have, Kalsoum doesn't even begin to sing for a
good 5-10 minutes. On some of the live recordings I have, you can hear the
audience going apeshit in anticipation of her stepping up to the mic &
singing--composers would write *into* that moment, knowing the effect it had
on audiences. Kalsoum was so popular that national leaders would schedule
speeches around her weekly radio show, which ran for decades. In a review of
one of her concerts, where she sang "Aruuh li-miin," Kamal Al-Najmi
complained that she went on until 4:00 a.m. (He later admitted she'd
probably only gone on until 3:00) "What was responsible for this protracted
length was the growing number of audience requests for repetitions of lines
and entire sections." (Virginia Danielson, _The Voice of Egypt_)

It's interesting to note, however true it is (& it's an exaggeration of
course), that it's frequently said that Oum Kalsoum is the "one thing all
arabs have ever agreed upon."

Kalsoum's popularity, however, has waned since the 60s. It's considered
"nostalgic" to listen to her, in the way that listening to Billie Holliday
might be considered an exercise in nostalgia. (In other words, there's this
admittance that she was great, which is unquestioned, but ...) The most
popular singer in Egypt (and most of the arabic world) right now is probably
Amr Diab, whose hit single "Habibe," which sounds more like the Gypsy Kings
than anything else, was played constantly on the radio for more than a year.
There are still singers who record renditions of songs Oum Kalsoum
originally made famous, but they're usually truncated, "poppy" versions. And
there are still singers recording things somewhat in the style or lineage of
Kalsoum--Asallah Nasri, for instance, who is a huge success, although very
different sounding, finally. Her latest, _Ya Akhi Is'al_, is beautiful but I
guess you could say sounds "metronomic" or something, in comparison. Also,
her voice has very little of that "hoarseness" or "scratchiness" or whatever
you get with Kalsoum, although it's certainly expressive--compare to Angham
or Najwa Karam, for instance, two other of my current faves.

Often troubling is the relationship of popular arabic music to Islamic
fundamentalists--many of the "rai" singers of Algeria have had to leave the
country--I think Cheb Hasni was murdered in the mid-90s by fundamentalists.
Kadim Al Sahir (also spelled Kazeem), who kind of goes back & forth between
a more traditional style and a "western" (or as many arabics refer to it,
"intercultural") style, tried to return to his native Iraq in the late 90s &
was shot & wounded. I've been looking, unsuccessfully, for anything by
Googoosh, who was supposedly the most popular pre-revolutionary singer in
Iran, and who now no longer sings--the price of remaining in Iran, according
to what I've read.

One thing I've never been able to wrap my mind around is that arabic singing
comes out of readings of the Koran. If you heard the broadcast from I guess
Yankee Stadium last Sunday, you heard the reading, which of course sounded
like singing--although it's not considered singing. I've never understood
this split, except for the (seemingly) obvious that in one case the "lyrics"
are sacred, in the other they're secular. But in explainations I've heard,
that's not the real issue. Can anyone explain this?

Thanks for the post, Jeffrey,

Gary

Thanks, George. I know this reverence of flags and arms is a part of a part
of American culture. I've never been very close to it. I don't even know if
I know anyone anymore who owns a gun, though I did when growing up in
Oklahoma. I have seen such window displays as you describe, and I try to
flee from them, too.

on another note, can I be a freelance reader, too?

Subject:      humanitarian intervention
MIME-Version: 1.0

I'd like to put my voice loudly behind the call for humanitarian
intervention previously raised here by Lawrence, cris and others. One of
the most difficult things I've read in the last week has been that
report from Chris Buckley from the Christian Aid Programme (as posted by
Alan.S., also available on ZNet) detailing his withdrawl due to fears of
American military intervention. It showed how The World Food Programme
in Herat has food there but has shut down its operations due to the same
fears, and so it is not being distributed. That such organisations are
having to back out due to US military heat at the time when 5 million
Afghan civilians are threatened with starvation (Oxfam report released
this weekend) is the sickest of ironies. Even more so when one realises
that the CAP and WFP could not cope with the crisis even if their work
was being allowed to continue, and that what they exactly needed in the
past and need now even more so with the Afghan winter about to kick in,
is a massive logistical operation that can get food from the West into
Afghans mouths - the sheer weight of men (sic) and machine now in the
area who could carry out such a task given a shift in political will, is
more than they could ever have wished for...

Of course, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan pre-dates Sept 11th by
a long way. War has been one of the major factors in its creation. War
will be the major factor in its continuance. I could think of no better
way to honour the dead of New York and Washington than by the US/NATO/EU
making good on prior humanitarian rhetoric and initiating operations in
Afghanistan that get people fed. What better context for US foreign
policy to be seen in by the vast majority of non-fundamentalists in the
Middle East, exactly the 'moderates' that must be won over if terrorism
is to be truly tamed (see the URL's from Anastosios:-

http://play.rbn.com/?wgbh/world/demand/we6.rm
http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2001/09/19/fighting_terror/print.html

for the importance of this approach for Britain and France in Ireland
and Algeria respectively)

Ron and Marjorie, I share your fears, and also the desire for action,
but sitting as I am in the middle of London, across the Thames from the
MI6 and Houses of Parliament, I reckon I'm closer to a terrorist cell
that might attack those places as any of military personel massing on
the borders of Afghanistan - they are not in the camps, they're in the
US and Europe. I fully support a police/intelligence based international
effort to track them in those places, its bias towards civil rather than
military law. Yes, they will act again I fear, but their actions will
appear far more justified to a Muslim world if they are performed
against the backdrop of a military assault in Afghanistan, then Iraq,
then... by the US/NATO/EU alliance, than if their terrorism came after
the kind of humanitarian efforts of that alliance discussed above.

further to this, what are people's thoughts on drafting something along
the lines of a press release that would detail support for a truly
humanitarian intervention - naive and ineffectual perhaps, but a
possibility....I'm figuring Marjorie's 92%/8% split also resembles the
balance of this list in favour of such humanitarian action - a draft
could be posted and then if you didn't want to be behind it, b/c to
Charles Alexander as list moderator saying so - it could then be
forwarded to media outlets, dressed up in 'their' language - 'Voice of
Int'l Poetic Community' or some such expedience - an idea anyway

and thanks to all for the quality of discussion hereabouts,

in hope,
Rob Holloway

Yes, what you create in the world you create in
spirit.  That spirit goes on.

I was stuck in SeaTac the friday after - it was during
the "minute of silence" the country observed-- simply
put, there were some people who simply wouldn't shut
up. For a minute. For five thousand dead people.  For
the terrorists.  For whatever you could take or give
or both to that minute.

I wonder if there aren't always going to be people who
are-- morons? terrorists? on & on.

So for me the question is: if compassion is the way to
go, how to really bring that about *now* as a tool?

Thanks, Scott

Great to hear from you.

I usually do not teach, and if there were enough money to be made at the
combination of small press and book arts I practice, or if I were a better
fundraiser, I would prefer to work at Chax Press all the time. Yet I also
love to teach, and each time I do, I am very happy about it.

This fall, for the first time in 17 or so years, I took an adjunct position
teaching, just as you say, a "basic grunt" class in composition, at Pima
Community College in Tucson. Students are quite varied, some of them sent
by their families from Mexico to become educated in the USA, some who are
on probation at the U of Arizona, students of all ages, including one on
her way to a second degree after having received her b.a. at Berkeley in 1968.

I had a class on September 12 and we did nothing but talk about the events
of the previous day, how people felt about it, what they thought should be
done, etc. I was somewhat surprised, and very pleased, at how thoughtful
the students were. Some, yes, were gung-ho for retaliation; one (my former
Berkeley student) even thought the USA getting 'tough' and doing such
things as closing its borders and cracking down on *bad* elements in other
countries, was long overdue; but most, even on that day after, were talking
about how to achieve peace, about not getting upset with all Muslims, and
about how scared they are that there might be a war (most thought there
would). They really wanted to talk and seemed to appreciate it that all I
did was come and sit at my desk and say, "Do you want to talk about what's
going on?" Since then, I've found them very energetic about discussion in
class, and there's never a problem relating what we're reading to current
events. Today they were the ones who were talking about the relevance of
Plato to current events; I didn't have to lead them.

Because I am teaching a semester class (I teach several 6 and 8-week
creative writing classes each year, and one or two book-making classes) for
the first time in ages, in some ways I'm making it up as I go along, with
most of the reading list planned in advance, but with the pace of it
responding to student needs, and what I do in individual class sessions
often determined a day or two before. Right now they need to talk, and
anything they read plays into other things they are thinking about. They're
quite civil in their discussions, too. I'm finding it all rather amazing,
and it's making my job much easier than I thought it might be. I don't know
how it will be for you, starting school a few weeks after the events; but
since the students won't have been with others in a classroom until then,
my guess is they will want to talk, too, and that a lot of what you can do
is just to let them do so, and allow enough freedom in writing assignments
to let them write about current events if they wish to do so, in ways that
are meaningful to them.

I tried writing out "America" to mean United States of America of a piece I
have written for _Masthead_, exchanging US or USA etc whenever I found it in
my draft.

[Actually even USA is a bit odd - Canada's a federation too, but we can live
and die with that]

It took me three goes and then I missed one. I could have got it with the
word-processor find function; but aiming to pick it up as I rewrote I found
it was invisible from familiarity. [Similar to picking up "he" to mean men
and women when I first tried it]

The real problem came with "American". United States citizen? Person of the
US? There is no word I know of outside of slang used abusively which would
not fit at all

The discussions on this list lead to some simple questions:

1) If an attack on your own soil is not enough to justify going to war, =
what act would justify a call to arms?

2) If the Taliban has "legitimate" grievances against the policies of =
the United States, should we help them rebuild their country so that =
their deadly, repressive polices against woman and religious minorities =
could be even more effectively administered? =20

3) Are the only innocent civilians that matter living outside the United =
States?

4) Is what remains of the "Left" as disconnected from normal, everyday =
people as the majority of the traffic on this list would indicate? =20

I was interested in Dan's recent post about the lack
of good responses from poets, and wanted to offer up
this encouraging development:  on Friday, as Rob and I
were driving from Boston to Unity (!), Maine for the
Common Ground Fair, we heard a broadcast of the WBUR
call-in show "The Connection."  I don't know at this
point whether or not this show is broadcast on NPR
stations anywhere outside of Boston, but the theme of
the day was "how can poetry help us cope with this
recent tragedy."  (It very well may be archived
online.)  He had Marie Howe and Naomi Shihab Nye on
and Nye read a poem by an Arab woman writer which was
very beautiful and then people from all over the
country called in to read their own poems or other
poems about tragedy...someone read a very moving piece
by Levine.  One of my favorite moments was when the
host got Nye on the phone and instead of starting by
answering questions or anything like that, Nye just
said, long distance from the Southwest to Marie in
NYC, "Hello, Marie, I've been thinking of you" and
Marie said "Hello, Naomi.  Hello, darling.  I've been
thinking of you, too."  It was silly and funny but
made me think of what a wonderfully tight community
the poetry community can be.  It was also just very
encouraging that someone at WBUR thought to HAVE this
sort of a show (it was apparently the suggestion of a
listener, though I wondered if our own Sean Cole had a
hand in any of it) and that so many Americans, many of
them not Poets (one guy was a real estate agent),
really do seem to turn to poetry in hard times. I was
wishing I could have called in myself, because there
was no representation or discussion of non-narrative
or non-linear poetic responses to tragedy, but I was
just really pleased to hear the show.  It made my
heart glad.

And so did the Common Ground Fair, which is an annual
weekend festival in Maine put on by organic farmers
and activists, and the whole thing was wonderfully
grassroots and positive.  Jim Hightower spoke and got
lots of applause for his pro-peace, pro-working-class,
anti-globalization message.  There are workshops on
alternative medicine (and even an herbalist/witchcraft
first aid tent!), folk art demos, all the food is
locally grown, etc.  It was terrific just to be
surrounded by people who seemed genuinely engaged in
making the world a better place.  If anyone wants more
info, please feel free to backchannel me.

  These will likely be of most interest to US readers, as they address what
the USA is likely to do in the short run, and what the current US strategic
thinking is about its vulnerabilities to terrorism on its own soil.

Excerpted from the Gitlin's article.

"Many say that the US should change its foreign policy - I have long thought the
US should be pressing Israel to end the occupation and uproot the settlements -
but the presumption that the fundamentalist murderers would be placated by a
just arrangement in Israel-Palestine is absurd. The question still dangles: what
to do?"

If the US changed it's Foreign Policy, at least it would be a START (ignoring
that fundamental plank is just as absurd as the point raised - and, in a
broad-brush context, neatly absolves any action required in that direction). In
my eyes, this would be the start down a long road of opening up, understanding
and reconciliation. Although I do agree with the attempts at justice - but whose
justice? Arabic or Western?

I think it would be worth looking for articles from Arabic writers - what
questions (aesthetic, moral, military) do they raise? Tending towards Western
voices can be blinkering.

   ABC, the television network, is acting against the television program
"Politically Incorrect" because of remarks by its host.  Apparently, when a
guest said that, whatever else it might be, flying a plane into a building
was not "cowardly," the host, Bill Maher, said: "We have been the cowards
lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That's cowardly."

   Supposedly, ABC is threatening to cancel the show; it has already been
pulled off the air here in D.C.

   This is exactly the kind of jingoistic censorship that American
principles are supposed to prevent.  Please phone or write your local ABC
affiliate and let them know that this is WRONG.

In response to Tuesday's terrorist attacks, Clear Channel, the world's
largest radio network, has sent out a list of some 150 "lyrically
questionable" songs by everyone from the Animals to the Zombies to its
radio stations, recommending that the songs not be aired. Some songs are
overtly violent in their intent, but the majority simply contain
metaphorical language or narrative aspects that connect uncomfortably
with the tragedy.

        Ron—

        I have been thinking about your excellent piece. To be sure, the murder of
more than 5,000 people warrants response, a thoughtful and powerful
response. Above all a practical, effective response.  To whom or what do we
respond? I ask this as a completely practical question.

        The Bush administration will have to respond, and its time for a response
is running out.  The oil men are no doubt as aware as any one of the dangers
of a misstep. They have great interests in the region which, with the wrong
move, they could push into chaos.  Any number of mistaken responses or
failed campaigns could plunge the entire region into war and civil war on
many fronts.

        War was in effect declared two weeks ago, and not a shot has been fired, or
as far as one can tell, a target identified.   There will, however, be a
response, probably this week. It will be made by men of fairly limited
capacity, and the intelligentsia (a word I find strangely embarrassing to
use) or whoever should provide a clearly articulated context in which to
make the decision has failed. I have been reading night and day.  I have not
found a really sharp analysis of the situation; I have a found  a suggestion
that seems to me likely to lead to practical solution to the problem.

        What response is appropriate?

        Whoever the murderers were, and we may never know, as at least some of them
seem to have been living under false identity for years, are dead.  We can
only respond to them by villifying their likely false names. Their ashes mix
with the ashes of their victims and are being scooped up and carried away.
Thus, we must respond to the accomplices of the murderers.

        This morning’s NYT reports that 352 suspects have been detained without
producing a trace of a connection to the terrorists:

        “Some investigators still believe that the plot was so intricately timed
that it almost certainly required help from accomplices on the ground who
helped scout airlines, airports and flight training schools.

        “But as days pass without evidence of their presence, other investigators
suggest that the hijackers designed their plot to self-destruct, leaving
behind no trace of other conspirators or much documentary evidence.

        “Moreover, investigators have still not identified a chief architect of the
plot who might have headed a decision-making structure and then fled.”

        The names of seventeen of the nineteen hijackers were unknown to American
intelligence before they were found on the passenger lists of the four
planes.  These murders’ appearance in the world lasted about an hour. In
that time one does not leave much of a trail.

        So we respond to something else. It appears that there is a world-wide
network of terrorists or would-be terrorists, some of whom where trained by
bin Ladin, some of whom may be knowingly sponsored or harbored by states or
perhaps half-knowing sponsored or harbored.   There are also religious
groups who, if not directly terrorists, are sympathetic with  the terrorists
in ways that may or may not be clearly articulated or even consistent with
their more conscious beliefs. But in none of this is there a clear military
target, and certainly not a target, if successfully taken out, would insure
a world safe from terrorism.

        I take it that our  response is not driven by vengeance but by a completely
reasonable desire to prevent future destructive attacks on innocent people
and on the fabric of civilized life.  So the response should attempt to
eliminate the terrorist threat without creating two (or ten) terrorists for
every one eliminated and without starting a world war.  Most scenarios of
military response have one or both of these possible, perhaps even likely,
outcomes.

        The ubiquitous US flag has mixed meanings, as such symbols always do. It
represents a certain strain of American terrorists, always ready to kill
people who are not like us (in terms of whatever difference), but it
represents an entire spectrum of other meanings as well.  Most significantly
in this case, I think,  it  represent a humble and completely reasonable
desire for a world in which people do not commit insane acts of mass
destruction for reasons that are unfathomable. It is a sign not of American
patriotism as much as American pragmatism. What can be done that is not in
its own way as senseless as the acts of the terrorists themselves?

        I do not ask this question from high moral ground.  I want this threat
eliminated.  I do not want the cities of the world sprayed with deadly
biological agents. I do not want war on a dozen fronts in Middle East.  And,
of course, it must be remembered that not all terrorists are connected with
Islam.  We have deadly terrorists with pure American credentials, and we
want to be safe from them too.

        I have a piece on my web site in which I try to suggest another analysis
that would hopefully underwrite a vigorous and powerful response that might
be more focused and more effective than a military response.It is
unfortunately a long ways from a practical program.

The Buddhist idea (and correct me if I'm wrong, you on
the list who have been studying this much longer than
I have) is that you start NOW with yourself --
generate compassion in yourself, for yourself, for
everyone else.  Through meditation, Right Thought,
Right Action, Right Speech, etc.  This itself is a
really, really hard step and pretty much a lifetime's
work, but I can say that the process itself can lead
to results in this lifetime.

I'd be most appreciative if some of the other
Buddhists on the list -- anyone at Naropa?  -- could
also post about living with compassion in these times,
reading suggestions, or any other ideas.  I am
literally taking refuge in the dharma (the
ideas/teachings of Buddha) at this time, but am not
involved in a sangha (community of fellow meditators)
at the moment and would love to hear from others
thinking through these things from this perspective.
Backchannel or front.

Thanks, all,
Arielle

<In response to Tuesday's terrorist attacks, Clear Channel, the world's
largest radio network, has sent out a list of some 150 "lyrically

radio stations, recommending that the songs not be aired. Some songs
are overtly violent in their intent, but the majority simply contain
metaphorical language or narrative aspects that connect uncomfortably

All the more reason why I was happy when Neil Young sang
"Imagine" (one of the songs on the list) at that Hollywood fund raiser

He sang it, and the world didn't end. Imagine that.

Hey, Heidi,

No, but I'm considering moving to the country.  We had
already been thinking about what life would be like if
we lived up in rural Maine and with all of this it in
some ways seems even more appealing.  Partly to avoid
being at the wrong end of someone's bull's eye but
mostly just to live closer to the land and be more
intergral to my own survival.  Live simply, all that
stuff.

I have in the past thought about leaving the country,
but where to go?  I like Canada quite a lot but it
doesn't need any more Americans in search of utopia.
I love Paris but France isn't exactly a model
government...and I have heard their acceptance of
feminist priniciples, just as one example, has a long
way to go.  I mean, there are struggles every where
you go, right?

xo,
Arielle

1. Your first point is very strong. There are lots of countries the US
dosesn't like, but the evidence for involvement in the WTC attack remains
tenuous--less than needed for conviction in a court of law. In the event
that we can't identify any one country as the source of aggression I
suggest that someone at the state department put slips of paper with the
names of all of the world's countries in a hat. The president, blindfolded,
should pick one. That country should be levelled by carpet bombing.

2. Your second point is something of a moral dilemma. The rights of
Afghanis of all genders are routinely and officialy trampled upon. Their
children routinely starve. A great many of them have suddenly preferred to
become refugees rather than suffer the violence they anticipate, and many
of these will die. I guess it's a question of priorities.

3. No.

4. Elements of the opinions aired on this list are beginning to sneak,
shyly, into the mainstream media. _Business Week_, of all places, had an
article last week outlining the dangers of US action. And last night Koppel
interviewed a pundit and former apparatchik (sorry, I don't remember more
than that) who opined that the best Bush could accomplish would be to "get
out of this" with as little damage to his administration as possible
because there is no way to "win."

odd how these times can make for odd bedfellows...

e.g., during last week's capital gang, bob novak seemed (to my ears)
to be questioning the logic/utility of doing anything---anything at
all---wrt afghanistan, bin laden or no bin laden...

now just b/c novak is a conservative through & through doesn't mean
we can't agree... but... but we all know how isolationist
conservatives can be, right?...

also:  kass and i just caught ~one day in september~ last night---the
documentary about the 1972 munich olympics (some editorializing going
on in this doc, of course)... watching that video just now is a
pretty eerie experience, "black september" and all...

best,

> Subject: Three things we learned | Economic Policy
Institue

      There is no silver lining to
      the cloud of horror that descended on America
last week. And
      the avalanche of pain, terror, and death we have
witnessed may
      be just the beginning.

     But life, as always, slowly picks
      up and moves on. Despite the nagging sense that
it is unseemly
      to begin thinking about the economic
consequences, the country
      is once again back in the market. Investors are
selling the stocks
      of insurance companies and airlines, buying
those of military
      contractors and companies that will benefit from
the new security-conscious
      society. Economists are calculating the gains
and losses and
      guessing about the odds of a recession.

    Many are engaged in burying the
      dead and tending to the survivors, or facing the
awesome responsibility
      of satisfying the national demand for action
that serves justice
      rather than multiplying evil. Those of us who
are going back
      to business have an obligation, as we do, to
reflect on what
      we have seen.

    The attacks of last Tuesday revealed
      some truths about the American political economy
that have been
      obscured in recent years.</FONT></P>

     One is just how much of our economy
      is made up of what used to be called the
&quot;working class&quot;
      -- the non-supervisory, non-college-educated
people who make
      up 70 percent of our labor force. For the last
half-dozen years
      the media saw economic trends through the eyes
of the glamorous,
      globe-trotting, business executive -- to the
point where it seemed
      to many that they must represent the vast
majority of American
      workers. And one could hardly find a more
fitting symbol of the
      new global economy than the World Trade Center
-- surrounded
      in the evening with a herd of sleek limousines
waiting to serve
      the masters of the universe at the end of the
day.And yet, it turns out, that the
      building was run by thousands of data clerks and
secretaries,
      waiters and dishwashers, janitors and
telecommunication repair
      people. The roll of trade unions mourning their
dead is long:
      firefighters, hotel and restaurant employees,
police, communication
      workers, service employees, teachers, federal
employees, pilots
      and flight attendants, longshoremen,
professional engineers,
      operating engineers, the electrical workers,
federal employees,
      building trades, and state, county, and
municipal employees.And many were in no union, meaning
      job insecurity, no benefits, and certainly no
limousines.</FONT></P>

      A second insight revealed by
      the awful gaping hole in the Manhattan skyline
was how ill-served
      we have been by a politics that perpetuates the
illusion that
      we are all on our own and, in particular, holds
the institutions
      of public service in contempt. For two decades,
politicians of
      both parties have celebrated the pursuit of
private gain over
      public service. Shrinking government has become
a preoccupation
      of political leaders through deregulation,
privatization, and
      cuts in public services.</FONT></P>

    One result is that the U.S. is
      the only major nation that leaves airline and
airport security
      in the hands of private corporations, which by
their very nature
      are motivated to spend as little as possible. So
the system was
      tossed in the lap of lowest-bid contractors who
hired people
      for minimum wages. Training has been inadequate
and supervision
      extremely lax. Turnover was 126 percent a year
and the average
      employee stayed in airline security for only six
months. Getting
      a job at Burger King or McDonald's represented
upward mobility
      for the average security worker. In an
anti-government political
      climate the airline corporations were able to
shrug off the government
      inspections that consistently revealed how easy
it was to bring
      weapons on board. The competition for customers
sacrificed safety
      to avoid any inconvenience. How else to explain
the insane notion
      that a 3-1/2 inch knife blade is not a weapon.
Private provision of public services
      has been the dominant philosophy of government
in our time. Only
      natural, the economists told us. People were
motivated by money.
      It's human nature. &quot;Greed is good,&quot;
said the movie
      character in the send-up of Wall Street -- a
sentiment echoed
      by politicians of both parties. &quot;Collective
solutions are
      a thing of the past….The era of big government
is over….You
      are on your own.&quot; Public service was
&quot;old&quot; economy,
      just for losers. A teacher in New York City
schools starts at
      $30,000. A brand new securities lawyer starts at
$120,000. Does
      anyone believe that this represents sensible
priorities?And does anyone believe that
      the firefighters who marched into that inferno
did it for money?
      Does anyone think that people working for a
private company hiring
      people for as little as possible would have had
the same motivation
      -- would have been as efficient? At the moment
when efficiency
      really counts? When the chips are down, where
      do we turn? To the government's firefighters,
police officers,
      rescue teams. To the nonprofit sectors' blood
banks and shelters.
      And to Big Government's army, navy, and air
force. During his
      campaign, the president of the United States
constantly complained
      that the people knew how to spend their money
better than the
      government did. Overnight, we just appropriated
$40 billion for
      the government to spend however it sees fit. Who
else would we
      trust? The stock market itself made
      one point. Despite calls for investors to
exercise patriotic
      restraint, the market opened with an avalanche
of sell orders,
      driving the Dow to its largest point loss in
history. As one
      broker said, &quot;This is how capitalism is
supposed to work.&quot;
      Just so. The market is about prices, not values.
Finally, perhaps we learned something
      about our national identity.It is common --
almost a clich&eacute;
      -- among political philosophers and pundits to
define America
      as an &quot;exception.&quot; For many, America's
exceptionalism
      means that it is the best place to get rich. For
others, it is
      our unique set of laws -- our Bill of Rights.
Still others see
      America not in national terms at all, but as a
patchwork of ethnic
      groups and regional interests.There is some
truth in all of
      these views. But those who risked and gave their
lives -- both
      the public servants and the brave civilian
passengers who rushed
      the terrorists and forced the airliner down in
Pennsylvania before
      it could get to Washington -- are unlikely to
have acted out
      of reverence for the deregulated market or for
our court system
      or for some ethnic or religious loyalty.

      Everything we know tells us that
      they acted as human beings responding to the
agony of other human
      beings, or trying in one last desperate effort
to spare their
      country more damage, not because it is the
world's superpower
      but simply because it is their country. No
country has a monopoly
      on simple patriotism.If America is, as the
politicians
      often remind us, the &quot;last best hope&quot;
for humankind,
      then it is not because we as individuals are
exceptional and
      different from the rest of the world, but
because we are much
      the same -- full of the normal set of human
traits, which at
      times of stress often bring out the best in us.
I send this out as a response to Ron, and all the rest
of you who have seen that this disaster has effected
working people most, and that it is working poeple who
have responded immediately and valiently.

In the last two weeks I have heard from friends and
colleagues all over the country and the response has
been mostly the same: we must act as citizens not as
leftists to let the goverment know what we believe is
right. Just as Eugene V. Debbes was imprisoned for his
response to The Great European War, twenty years later
his socialist platform became the New Deal. Leftists
of the 60s are in positions of power throughout the
country now and we are frequently the voices of our
professions: teachers, librarians, social workers,
municipal workers of many categories.
Demonstrations, dialogues, and meetings of all sorts
are happening all over the countery right now. This is
no time to throw in the towel and say we have lost our
political identity.  On the contrary, it is a time to
recognize the fact that this is a country still
capable of amazing acts of heroism and concieince. I
live and work in a community of predominantly Asian,
Mexican, and  near eastern immigrants.  They think we
are the greatest people in the world.
The following was sent to me from old friends in New
Mexico.Laurie

We can no longer rely on our exceptionalism to keep us
safe. In the coming
      weeks and months and years we are likely to be
reminded of that.
      To get through this, we need to be disabused
quickly of the illusion
      that we are all on our own. America's strength,
like the strength
      of any other society, is in our ability to be
there for each
      other.

  I live and work (for the US govt) within a half mile of the Capitol.
Places I love and have spent time in in the past include Gwynedd, North
Wales; a headland on the island of Paros; Guilin, China; and 67 acres I have
in rural Frederick County, Maryland.  Look forward to seeing all of them
again, but am staying here.  Sometimes I feel like there's a great big
concentric bullseye on the Dome (a target bin Laden missed) and,
consequently, both warlike and frightened, but I also feel like the way to
be peaceful is act peaceful, which in my case means staying here.

   "Here" including inside my own skin.  As Arielle Greenberg said earlier
today,

"The Buddhist idea (and correct me if I'm wrong, you on

Subject:      Postraumatic Stress Disorder
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Source: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)


" The essential feature of Postraumatic Stress Disorder is the development
of characteristic symptoms following exposure to an extreme traumatic
stressor involving direct personal experience of an event that involves
actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one's
physical integrity; or witnessing an event that involves death, injury,or a
threat to the physical integrity of another person,or learning about
unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat or death or injury
experienced by a family member or close associate (Criterion A1). The
person's response must involve intense fear, helplessness, or horror (in
children, the reponse must involve disorganized or agitated behavior)
(Criterion A2). The characteristic symptoms resulting from the exposure to
the extreme trauma include persistent reexperiencing of the traumatic event
(Criterion B), persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma
and numbing of general responsiveness (Criterion C) and persistent symptoms
of increased arousal ( Criterion D). The full symptom picture must be
present for more than 1 month (Criterion E), and the disturbance must cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning (Criterion F).
   Traumatic events that are experienced directly include, but are not
limited to, military combat, violent personal assault (sexual assault,
physical attaack, robbery, mugging)being kidnapped, being taken hostage,
terrorist attack, torture, incarceration as a prisoner of  war or in a
concentration camp, natural or manmade disasters, severe automobile
accidents, or being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. For
children, sexually traumatic events may include developmentally
inappropriate sexual experiences without threated or actual violence or
injury. Witnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing the
serious injury or unnatural death of another person dur to violent
asssault, accident, war, or disaster or unexpectedly witnessing a dead body
or body parts.Events experienced by others that are learned about include,
but are not limited to, violent personal assault, serious accident, or
serious injury experienced by a family member or close friend; or learning
that one's child has a life-threatening disease. The disorder may be
especially severe or long lasting when the stressor is of human design
(e.g. torture, rape). The likelihood of developing this disorder may
increase as the intensity of and physical proximity to the stressor
increase.
   The traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly the
person has recurrent and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion
B1) or recurrent distressing dreams during which the event is replayed
(Criterion B2). In rare instances the person experiences dissociative
states that last from a few seconds to several hours, or even days, during
which components of the event are relived
and the person behaves as though experiencing the event at that moment
(Criterion B3). Intense psychological distress (Criterion B4) or
physiological reactivity (Criterion B5) often occurs when the person is
exposed to triggering events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the
traumatic event (e.g. anniversaries of the traumatic event; cold, snowy
weather or uniformed guards for survivors of death camps in cold climates,
hot humid weather for combat veterans of the South Pacific; entering any
elevator for a woman who was raped in an elevator).
   Stimuli associated with the trauma are persistently avoided.The person
commonly makes deliberate efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, or
conversations about the traumatic event (Criterion C1) and to avoid
activities, situations, or people who arouse recollections of it (Criterion
C2). This avoidance of reminders may include amnesia for an important
aspect of the traumatic event (Criterion C3). Diminished responsiveness to
the external world, referred to as "psychic numbing" or "emotional
anaesthesia" usually begins soon after the traumatic event. The individual
may complain of having markedly diminished interest or participation in
previously enjoyed activities (Criterion C4), of feeling detached or
estranged from other people (Criterion C5), or of having markedly reduced
ability to feel emotions (especially those associated with intimacy,
tenderness, and sexuality) (Criterion C6). The individual may have a sense
of foreshortened future (e.g. not expecting to have a career, marriage,
children or a hormal life span) (Criterion C7).
   The individual has persistent symptoms of anxiety or increased arousal
that were not present before the trauma.These symptoms may include
difficulty falling or staying asleep that may be due to recurrent
nightmares during which the traumatic event is relived (Criterion D1),
hypervigilance (Criterion D4) and exaggerated startle response (Criterion
D5). Some individuals report irritability or outbursts of anger (Criterion
D2) or difficulty concentrating or completing tasks (Criterion D3)

Specifiers

The  following specifiers may be used to specify onset and duration of the
symptoms of  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder:

Acute. This specifier should be used when the duration of symptoms is less
than 3 months.
Chronic. This specifier should be used when the symptoms last 3 months or
longer.
With delayed onset. This specifier indicates that at least 6 months have
passed between the traumatic event and the onset of the symptoms....

Associated Features and Disorders

Individuals with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder may describe painful guilt
feelings about surviving when others did not survive or about the things
they had to do to survive.  Phobic avoidance of situations or activities
that resemble or symbolize the original trauma may interfere with
interpersonal
relationships and lead to marital conflict, divorce,or loss of job. The
following associated constellation of symptoms may occur and are more
commonly seen with an interpersonal stressor (e.g. childhood sexual or
physical abuse, domestic battering, being taken hostage, incarcertion as a
prisoner of war or in a concentration camp, torture): impaired affect
modulation, self-destructive and impulsive behavior; dissociative symptoms;
somatic complaints; feelings of ineffectiveness, shame, despair or
hopelessness; feeling permanently damaged; a loss of previously sustained
beliefs; hostility; social withdrawal; feeling constantly threatened;
impaired relationships with others; or a change from the individual's
previous personality characteristics.
   There may be increased risk of Panic Disorder, Agorophobia,
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Social Phobia,Specific Phobia, Major
Depressive Disorder, Somatization Disorder and Substance-Related Disorders.
It is not known to what extent thse disorders precede or follow the onset
of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

Associated laboratory findings.Increased arousal may be measured through
studies of autonomic functioning (e.g. heart rate, electromyography, sweat
gland activity ).

Associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions.
General medical conditions may occur as a consequence of the trauma (e.g.
head injury, burns)

Specific Culture and Age Featues

Individuals who have recently emigrated from areas of considerable social
unrest and civil conflict may have elevated rates of Posttraumatic Stress
Disorder. Such individuals may be expecially reluctant to divulge
experiences of torture and trauma due to their vulnerable political
immigrant status.Specific assessments of traumatic experiences and
concomitant symptoms are needed for such individuals.
   In younger children , distressing dreams of the event may, within
several weeks, change into generalized nightmares of monsters, of rescuing
children, or of threats to self and others....children may also exhibit
various physical symptoms, such as stomachaches and headaches....

Course
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder can occur at any age, including childhood.
Symptoms usually begin within the first 3 months after the trauma, although
there may be a delay of months, or even years, before symptoms appear.
Frequently, the disturbance initially meets criterion for Acute Stress
Disorder in the immediate aftermath of the trauma....The severity,
duration, and proximity of an individual's exposure to the traumatic event
are the most imortant factors affecting the likelihood of developing this
disorder. There is some evidence that social supports, family history,
childhood experiences, personality variables, and preexisting mental
disorders may influence the development of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
This disorder can develop in individuals without any predisposing
conditions, particularly if the stressor is especially extreme....

There was a news report on the 10:00 news the other night of a peace
rally
in Delores Park in San Francisco. The analysis of the event by the
speakers
was that American military response to the WTC attack was "another
example of
America waging war against people of color". Truthfully I felt relieved
I hadn't
gone so I didn't have to listen to this kind of analysis in the name of
an
interest in peace. our oh-so american political ignorance of the world
is every
bit as much on display in that analysis as in the analysis of the Wall
Street
Journal editorial page.

> For instance, I have not seen any reportage of peace demonstrations in

A friend in NYC came up with the idea that the left has to organize
around
this situation in the manner of ACT-UP, aggressively pursuing
information & analysis,
as ACT-UP did with funding research into treatment, and then make
sophisticated
and informed and specific policy recommendations, from the
demonstrations in
the streets. (Thanks rachel levitsky for your idea). We need teach-ins,
where
hard questions are asked, of the united states of course, but also with
regards to
the whole volatile religious and cultural and political mix in the
middle east.
What is to be done? For starters, avoid the mistake of pasting old but
easily available
rhetoric onto this terrible situation.

What happened at the WTC was perhaps not an act of war. It was,
unfortunately,
a massacre. Doing nothing, waiting around for the other shoe to drop,
will
simply not happen. It is not an option. If the left is to have any
moderating effect at all, it must bother both to educate itself, and to
treat the
threat seriously.

As it turns out, the much reported banning or recommended banning of songs
is half-truth, half-rumor.  See the following NYT article on internet rumors
surrounding the events of the last two weeks.

Nick,
     thanks for posting this.  This current crisis does seem related in =
some ways, and you've reawoken for me some things I did on PTSD several =

Subject: The Infinite Mind: Courage, Altruism, Trauma, Grieving, and =
Anxiety


This week on The Infinite Mind, "Mental Health in Troubled Times," a =
compilation of common sense, science and psychology on topics such as =
courage, altruism, trauma, grieving, and anxiety from some of our best =
programs.=20
According to a recent study by the Pew Research Center, 7 out of 10 =
Americans are feeling depressed in the wake of the September 11th =
attacks, nearly half have had trouble concentrating, and nearly =
one-third report having trouble sleeping at night. We offer insight into =
these reactions and perspective on a range of psychological, social and =
ethical issues now affecting all of our lives. Guests include:=20

- Dr. Matthew Friedman, director of the National Center for Post =
Traumatic Stress Disorder, who discusses the diagnosis and treatment of =
PTSD, including how to know when normal anxiety or nightmares become =
problems needing clinical attention;=20

- Tony Tedeschi, Ed Mislynski, and George Healy of Rescue Company One, =
the New York City Fire Department's oldest rescue team, who give their =
thoughts on what it takes to rush into a burning or collapsing building. =
(All members of Rescue Company One who were on duty on September 11th =
are now lost);=20

- Noted anxiety researcher Dr. Michael Davis of Emory University, who =
explains the biology of anxiety and describes the connection between =
anxiety, the senses and memory.

The show also features a discussion about altruism with a Buddhist lama, =
an Episcopal priest, a Muslim imam and a Jewish rabbi and a moving =
personal commentary about grief by John Hockenberry.

I was staying with my friend Bob Waterhouse when it Happened. I woke
at 8:35 am to the Cable News Network - his custom to watch it over morning
coffee. After a few hours, I stumbled the three blocks home to numbly post
two New York Times articles to the List: it was all that I could do at the
moment, but at the least I felt obliged to reach anyone who was out there
and not yet aware of what had taken place. I should say, 'had happened' -
for it seems that many of the 651 messages that have come to this List
since those two articles have come in an effort, precisely, to compel
11S to take place definitively in our respective lives: to locate in our
several conceptions of New York a hole large enough for 64-hundred dead.
As Liz Grosz remarked the other day, it has been the immediate, animal
responsiveness to these events that has offered the greatest hope; to
be human has been demonstrated again not to be homo sapiens - reasoning
man - but something more rapidly feeling. What comes after - the
accustomed calls for vengeance and accustomed cries for peace, the
formulation and rationalization and confusion - has been quite necessary
but less bright. My personal thanks for early posts to Brian Kim Stefans,
Leslie Scalapino and/or David Cook, Lee Ann Brown, Charles Bernstein,
Anselm Berrigan, and others. Sampson Reed, one of Emerson's classmates at
Harvard, under very different circumstances once said, "There has always
been a fire on the earth"; in Reed's oration, this statement is equated
with its fore-runner: "The human heart has always had love of some kind."
More recently, even a simple message like Brenda Coultas' "okay in NYC"
has been enough to turn its bright light toward us.

But having tentatively, and each in our small way 'realized' a massacre,
we are needful of strategizing responses - with an 's' meaning that we is
not a consensus. This List is one of many useful meeting places, and
personally I hope to see it made useful. For example, when Rob Holloway
enquires about

> drafting something along the lines of a press release that would
> detail support for a truly humanitarian intervention"

- it is needless to ask - as I take the subsequent comments to ask -
whether I would allow such a thing; as needless to ask whether I agree
with it. I have opinions and will say them, as will others theirs; but
am here chiefly to keep the channel open. I would have no objection to
such a document emerging from or being sent to this List, any more than
I have objected to the List's recently becoming a sort of - broadly -
political scratchpad.

Bergson, in the Creative Evolution, asserts that our logic is pre-eminently
the logic of solids: "our intellect triumphs in geometry." His point, there
as elsewhere, is to introject the possibility of Time, and consequently of
Becoming. Mine, here, is to say that what the List has been is no more -
even those portions of it that seem not to have changed. More than
anything,
recent discoursing has made me realize that it remains, or is again and
again momently a space for the articulation of new possibilities. Having
spent yesterday evening with Cole Swenson's book The Park, I could say it
is "Light redistributing the news." In this regard, personal thanks to
Michael Kelleher, Rodrigo Toscano, Camille Roy, Elizabeth Treadwell
Jackson,
Jordan Davis, and others. Let us have more!

Finally, an aside: as to the question of whether the Left is 'out of
touch':
certainly we must be careful not to accept this as merely a pejorative for
'in disagreement' - which, in fact, the Left is.

right, but my fear is that thinking in the old rhetoric (of two weeks ago)
is going to lead to the 'left' being isolated from the great 'middle' mass
of this and other countries.  My recollections (hazy though they may be) of
SDS is that the media turned it into a black/white, either/or kind of thing
and the greys were ignored.  The 'sit-ins' can and should include the
flag-aver next-door?

This remark would have been more comprehensive were it added that

work and go to school.>>

   This remark, in turn, would be more persuasive if it were accurate.  The
US did not "install" the Taliban.  The Taliban "installed" itself;
initially, most of the Afghan people accepted it as a more attractive
substitute to the brutal regime that took over after the end of the Soviet
occupation, perhaps not knowing the kind of repression that would follow.
(The triggering event for the formation of the Taliban was religious and
popular reaction to a gang rape but two of those people.)

I just used 'Amerika', Lawrence, and for the same publication, as it
happens. I felt somehow that no-one would mistake that for say Guatemala or

Yes I have noticed this too. It is frightful, though, about Bill Maher being
booted off TV (the Politically Incorrect host). (What freedoms precisely
then are we protecting?) Students at UCB are now protesting both for and
against war, they have never seemed so babyish to me. Students at Berkeley
High are doing teach-ins on tolerance. So again my townie cap to them.

I can't imagine how tiring it must be to be teaching these days. My hats off
to all of you.

Someone wrote that (& I paraphrase) "if we don't respond militarily to an
attack on our soil when can we respond..." etc.

I can no longer resist mentioning the fact that this good ol USA was founded
in the abyss of a holocaust inflicted by immigrants on the indigenous
peoples. It's been centuries and that's still not looked at much, much less
resolved in any coherent, much less reasonable/compassionate, way. That's
what's most shameful to me --- how can we expect to be healthy, or
respected, as a nation, unless we confront that.

nice analysis, Barrett.  This is whyi feel it's important right now thatwe
not let the flag revert to an empty jinoist and isolationist weapon.

Dear Clear Channel,

Does that mean that the David Bowie/Mick Jagger and the Grateful Dead
versions of these songs are acceptable? If the latter, which era of the
Grateful Dead is acceptable: the Pigpen Era, the Keith Godchaux Era, the
Brent Mydland Era, and/or the Bruce Hornsby/Vince Welnick Era? I ask this
latter particularly because four former members of the Grateful Dead are
now literally dead, and because the name "Grateful Dead" itself might come
to have unsavory implications in light of the recent disaster. If one or
more of the Grateful Dead versions might be acceptable, are there any show
dates one should refrain from playing because of their negative
connotations (any 9/11 show springs to mind)?

Yours faithfully,

Christopher,

firstly many apologies for getting your first name wrong. I'm afraid I
composed the post before work this morning, the clock was ticking fast,
and by the end it was all getting very late...

for the same reasons, I carelessly wrote near the end:-

        "a draft could be posted and then if you didn't want to be
        behind it, b/c to Charles Alexander as list moderator saying
        so".

I didn't intend this to mean that anyone who disagreed with the list
being used in this way should then contact you, and thus force you into
some position of arbitration about ultimately whether such a thing was
'allowable', though your response:-

        "- it is needless to ask - as I take the subsequent comments to
        ask - whether I would allow such a thing; as needless to ask
        whether I agree with it."

now clearly shows me this meaning - again, apologies for my lack of
clarity -

so, what I *was* doing in my bit quoted above, was simply floating a
possible way in which people who didn't want to associate themselves
with any such 'document' could say so before it ever went anywhere else,
so that their names didn't show on the list of those who did support
it...but of course, this was just thoughts about projected tinkering for
later on once any such document had indeed been set up etc...

the principle intention of the final paragraph of my post was to raise
the basic question with people on this list about whether they would
want to create such a document in the first place - and thinking again,
maybe a more workable option might be, as has been suggested to me
backchannel, for anyone who is interested to contact me directly - I
then work on a draft to be tweeked etc, and then we as a group just take
it from there - i.e. it is something formulated backchannel on a smaller
scale (which the response level so far seems to indicate is more
suitable) - having said that, if anyone wants to suggest another way,
please go ahead

so apologies to you, and all, for initial confusions here - as I said,
due to time, I was at the top of my head as it were, and my job flaps
were definitely beginning to show - I hope this opportunity for
clarification can be helpful in getting some kind of statement together
for those who would like to

and thank you Christopher for the openness you show in discussing the
ways in which this list may be useful at these times, and in encouraging
a potential for the list to morph in response to those uses

finally, I couldn't agree more about the importance of the kind of posts
you mention

yours,
Rob Holloway.

Answer: None, unless you have abandoned Christianity and / or sense

| 2) If the Taliban has "legitimate" grievances against the policies of the
United States, should we help them rebuild their country so that their
deadly, repressive polices against woman and religious minorities could be

Answer: That is not a simple question. Nor is it, in my judgement, an honest
question because it assumes the correctness of things it only asserts...
Hint - It isn't *their country and it isn't USA's

3) Are the only innocent civilians that matter living outside the United

Answer: All innocent citizens matter. All guilty citizens matter. Non
citizens matter

4) Is what remains of the "Left" as disconnected from normal, everyday
people as the majority of the traffic on this list would indicate?

Answer: I don't understand your question. What is "the Left"?

Regarding the normal and everyday, the vulnerability you all feel in USA is
what is felt everyday in the world at large. In that, you have my sympathy;
but not beyond that

I believe the letter cited on this list as from H.H. the Dalai Lama is a
hoax, and a familiar one -- a number of them have appeared in his name
only to be denounced as fraudulent.  The content and style do not
correspond to his dryer, more careful letters.  Here is his office's
denial as regards a letter printed on another list [I have removed names
and addresses because I have not sought permission to cite them]:

***Note -I have been informed that the letter dated September 12,
2001, that has been published on [some lists] on September 21, is false.

It did not originate from HH the Dalai Lama. For your information, I
attach the correspondence I received on this issue, as well as a
"real" letter to President Bush that has been written by His
Holiness. [List moderator]***

Dear Mr. G...,

Thank you for your inquiry.  Actually, the letter you sent is a

have any information on how it originally started circulating it
would be very helpful to the Office of Tibet.  In addition, please

September 12, 2001

Your Excellency,

        I am deeply shocked by the terrorist attacks that took place
involving four apparently hijacked aircrafts and the immense
devastation these caused.  It is a terrible tragedy that so many
innocent lives have been lost and it seems unbelievable that anyone
would choose to target the World Trade Center in New York City and
the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.  We are deeply saddened.  On behalf
of the Tibetan people I would like to convey our deepest condolence
and solidarity with the American people during this painful time.
Our prayers go out to the many who have lost their lives, those who
have been injured and the many more who have been traumatized by this
senseless act of violence.  I am attending a special prayer for the
United States and its people at our main temple today.

        I am confident that the United States as a great and powerful
nation will be able to overcome this present tragedy.  The American
people have shown their resilience, courage and determination when
faced with such difficult and sad situations.

        It may seem presumptuous on my part, but I personally believe
we need to think seriously whether a violent reaction is the right
thing to do and in the greater interest of the nation and the people
in the long run.  I believe violence will only increase the cycle of
violence.  But how do we deal with hatred and anger which are often
the root causes of such senseless violence?  This is a very difficult
question, especially when it concerns a nation and we have certain
fixed conceptions of how to deal with such attacks.  I am sure you
will make the right decision.

        With my prayers and good wishes,

                                Yours sincerely,

                        [signature]

Prior to September 11th and following a trip last year to Cambodia, I
had spent much of the past year reading material about the Vietnam War,
and its impact on neighboring counties like Laos and Cambodia.  So much
of what the US did during that war was atrocious, and many people in the
traditional left who grew up during that time, myself included, carry
with us a large amount of conflict over what it means to be a citizen of
the United States.

In light of that, I am grateful to the posts on this list  which have
attempted to broaden the discussion of current events beyond a
traditional leftist knee jerk response.

Living as close as I do to NYC, I’ve been lucky enough to participate in
some of the volunteer efforts there.  Yesterday I spent the day on  a
large dining cruise ship anchored near the former towers where we served
food through the Red Cross.

Being in such close proximity to the wreckage really does little to make
the situation more ‘real’ -- I can tell you that.  The mood at the site
is one of quiet resignation at this point.  There is no ‘rah rah USA’
chanting going on, little talk of retaliation against who, what or
when.  The focus is, as it has to be, on the work, and for us, cooking
up and sorting out the huge amount of donated supplies that arrive by
boat several times a day.  The Red Cross has already served over a
million meals.

The people working at the site are from all over the country.  Our Red
Cross shift leaders were from Minneapolis and Oregon.   88% of the Red
Cross staff is volunteer.  When it comes to staffing the boat with
cooks, servers, etc., there are more volunteers than available work.

After nine hours on that boat, I cannot imagine how the people who are
working the site are continuing to labor so hard, day after day after
day.  Many of the departments who send personnel require their people to
commit to 8 days of 12 hours on, 12 hours off.

The top floor of the boat has become a sleeping area -- with a battery
of chiropractors and masseuses available.  If that sounds like a luxury
its far from it.  Add to that the psychological exhaustion these workers
face as they realize the operation is reaching the point where the city
will have to decide what to do next, though many of the workers said
that with access to a water supply, people could still be alive.  One
man told me that for days they had been walking around to all the
smaller, deeper vents and tossing down bottles of water and wrapped
sandwiches.

Most of the coverage I’ve seen on television does not offer camera
positions where one can see just how large an area was impacted, or the
effect on neighboring buildings which are still standing.  Girders hang
off blasted facades, smoke continues to fill the air as new fires flare
up.  All the workers on the site wear extremely heavy gear, hard hats
and breathing masks.  Just toting all that clothing around in weather
that fluctuates from sopping humidity to rain to hot sun is enough to
make most people I know need a day or two off to recover.

On my jean jacket, I have an old ‘hippie’ button.  It says:  “Whatever
you do may seem insignificant, but it is most important that you do
it.”  I find that quote extremely helpful because I recognize that no
matter how progressive my personal politics, the fact that I drive a
car, heat my home, use a credit card, go to a movie, watch television,
purchase imported food, and as a woman, work and become educated,  all
makes me complicit in the ‘sins’ of my country from the terrorists’
perspective.  To not recognize that complicity is naive.  To not use the
freedoms I am given to make a positive impact, however small, is a
travesty.

There’s another old hippie saying:  If you’re not part of the solution,
you’re part of the problem.

The events of September 11th have had a vast impact.  People wish to
*do* something.  The most obvious things US citizens have been given to
do to date include flying flags and supporting the President.  What we’d
call a right wing knee jerk response.  They can also give money, a
decision that can be made and executed much too quickly to give much
psychological benefit to the giver, no matter how good the cause.

I think it may be up to the left to offer alternative (and in the course
of donations, additional)  responses.  Opportunities for dialogue that
reach past cliche.  Opportunities to mourn and experience sadness.
Means to formulate a response that recognizes and gives positive vent to
the fear that many citizens of the US and the world are now feeling.
And celebrations of who and what we are and can be if we utilize our
freedom wisely.

In addition, there are so many charities and important causes which will
have a hard time raising funds and finding support  given how much focus
is going towards September 11th funds.  As writers and artists we have a
large network at our disposal; but I think we also have to seize this
opportunity to make sure that what we do and say reaches ‘outside the
box’.

All my best to all of you,

Jennifer Ley

             Bronx Accent: A Literary Salute to the Borough
         Creative Arts Café Poetry Series Continues Fall Series

Mt. Kisco, NY: October 1st  7:30 PM the Creative Arts Café Poetry Series
at the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts continues its seventh
season with selected readings of works in Bronx Accent; A Literary and
Pictorial History of the Borough.  Readers are Lloyd Ultan and Barbara
Unger. The reading is followed by a reception, book signing and OPEN
MIKE.

The comprehensive book,  Bronx Accent, captures the Zeitgeist of The
Bronx through the eyes of its writers-both past  literary figures and
emerging talents. Lloyd Ultan and Barbara Unger place this literature in
its historical   context. They include almost one hundred vintage
photographs from The Bronx Historical Society and  postcard views from
the early decades of the century, bringing the writings to life. The
resulting work provides the reader with insight into the kaleidoscopic
shifts in Bronx life over the centuries. Filtered through the
imaginations of authors of different times, ethnic groups, social
classes, and literary styles,  the borough of The Bronx emerges not only
as a shaper of destinies and lives, but as an important literary  mecca.
Some writers included in the book are: Sholem Aleichem,  James Baldwin,
James Fenimore Cooper,                     Theodore Dreiser,
Washington Irving,  Jack Kerouac,   Clifford Odets,    Cynthia Ozick,
Grace Paley,  Edgar Allan Poe, Chaim Potok ,  Kate Simon,   Leon
Trotsky,  Mark Twain, Tom Wolfe,  Herman Wouk and many others

Lloyd Ulton is the author of 6 books, including The Beautiful Bronx,
1930 n- 1950 and The Bronx of Innocent Years: 1890 – 1925.  He is a
professor of History at Fairleigh Dickenson University and has been
appointed the Bronx Borough Historian.

Barbara Unger is a poet and a professor of English at Rockland Communtiy
College of the State University of New York.  She is the author of a
book of short Fiction plus five collections of poetry.

The suggested donation is $7.00; Seniors and Students: $5.00.

The Creative Ars Café Poetry Series is funded by the New York State
Council on the Arts and the Bydale Foundation.

OPEN MIKE and Welch Poet Robert Minhinnick
Robert Minhinnick (b. 1952) is a  Welsh poet, essayist and
environmental activist. He has  published six collections of  poems,
which Carcanet published a selection of in 1999 in Selected Poems. His
earliest poems are set amidst heavy industry and describe the landscapes
of the poet's childhood in Wales. His later  poems move about Brazil and
the USA, and develops broader views of history and culture. Minhinnick's
poems have won a number of literary  awards, most recently, in 1999, the
Forward Prize  for Best Individual Poem. Twenty-five Laments for Iraq
can be read on the Internet
(www.cam.ac.uk/societies/casi/info/25laments.html). Minhinnick is
currently working on his third collection of essays. The ironic and
impressionistic essays in his second collection (Badlands, 1996)  spread
out a broad map of the absurd zones of the
world. They take a look at post-communist Albania, the pecularities of
California, and the current state of Wales and England. Minhinnick's
hyperbolic   style has been compared to that of Martin Amis and his
wanderlust to Bruce Chatwin's. Minhinnick
has                              also edited collections of essays on
conservation,  including The Green Agenda: Essays on The  Environment of
Wales (1994). He is currently editor-in-chief of the Poetry Wales
literary magazine  and lives in the town of Portcawl in South Wales.
His interests include collecting driftwood, cooking  curry meals,
playing beach soccer and training
jellyfish.

Poetry Readings and Workshops featuring

CHARLES ALEXANDER

and

CARLA HARRYMAN

CHARLES ALEXANDER is a poet, publisher, and book artist who lives in
Tucson, Arizona.  His books of poetry include Pushing Water (1998), Four
Ninety-Eight to Seven (1998), arc of light/dark matter (1992), and Hopeful
Buildings (1990).  His newest book, Etudes: D & D, is forthcoming from
Quarry Press.  Alexander is founder, director, and book artist of Chax
Press, a publisher of trade literary editions and handmade letterpress
books that explore innovative writing and its conjunction with book forms.
Through his work with visual arts, dancers and musicians, Alexander brings
to poetry a broad sense of artistic and collaborative possibility.
Currently he teaches poetry at the University of Arizona.  Ron Silliman
calls the poems in arc of light/dark matter "rich with news, life, war,
sex, parenting, the texts at hand, the spicing of mulled thought, humor,
bright southwestern colors, and an ear to die for . . . . This is the most
sensuous, intelligent, rewarding writing I've read in ages."

CARLA HARRYMAN is a poet whose work often blends the genres of poetry,
playwrighting, and fiction.  Her most recent work is Gardener of Stars
(forthcoming 2001).  Other books include The Words: After Carl Sandburg's
Rootabaga Stories and Jean-Paul Sartre (1999), There Never Was a Rose
Without a Thorn (1995), and Animal Instincts (1989).  Harryman has won
numerous awards for her work, including the Fund for Poetry, the Millay
Colony Award, and the New American Fiction Award.  She has read her poetry
throughout the United States and in the U.K. and France, and her poetic
plays have been widely performed in the United States and in New Zealand
and the U.K.  Currently she teaches in the Department of English at Wayne
State University.  Lynne Tillman says that in The Words, Harryman
"playfully examines the family, the suburbs, daily life, the position of
woman, while boldly undermining notions about character and plot.  There's
a ferocity to her wit. . . . I admire Harryman's rare mind, its gleeful
feminism, broad
 intelligence, and anarchic inventiveness."

Everyone. Allen Curnow was a major poet anywhere in the world. I attended
lectures for one year (1968) and he lectured (amongst other subjects) on
Browning who I thought or had thought at the time was rather dull: mainly
because then I didnt know much about poetry and was only dimly aware of his
famous "Pied Piper.."  poem..but his lectures on Browning were (I found )
quite fascinating. Then when I took up my "poetry hobby" more recently an
old frienfd of my father's gave me a book of Alan Curnow's. I met Allan
Curnow  briefly at a memorial for Kendrick Smithyman who was also a great
poet: at that meeting I pointed out half humorously how I had had to stop
reading his poetry as they were..well simply impossible to "equal" and they
made it nearly inpossible for me to "think" or write, they haunted, so to
speak: to attempt the rigorous brilliance of Allan Curnow to quote Alan
himself was..well here's the last stanza of "A Leaf":

       Bud of a leaf, blade of a leaf
       Given a strange twist, given for something to do
       With deadly baffled fingers happy to squeeze
       Blood from a conundrum: insoluble but endlessly
       Amusing in the attempt

His poems baffled and haunted and were often dark and strange, sometimes
even savage, but he was from years of working as a "technition" and his wide
and intense reading and knowledge (especially of factual and 'conceptual"
details),his, I believe, considerable interest in such as Dylan Thomas and
then Wallace Stevens and others was always  a "conundrum" ( or at least a
challenge and an inspiration) for any aspiring writer: bafflingly brilliant:
I at one time stopped reading Curnow because I was so "under his spell" that
I was writing poor imitations of his stuff: but maybe without knowing.
  When I met him in 1996 he was a dignified but fairly jovial person who
laughed when I pointed this out. Then in the converstion he said that he
"didnt like all this jangly jangly postmodern stuff" and commented that he
was a "post post modernist"...he didnt like being in anyone's categories
(who does?) .... Curnow is/was a great man and a great poet in anyone's
language. My feelings for you Wystan and others who loved him and or knew
him or his work. Richard

If the US removes all military forces from ANY and EVERY nation oputside the
US  and concentrates on giving aid where requested rather than interferring
in any sates whatsoever and  the people of the world move toward the
progressive transformations of their own countries to higher levels of
democracy and prosperity the main energy for terrorism will be greatly
diminished. The US should stay out of this except where asked: they should
never censor another country for "terrorism" or "civil rights violations":
that's the business of the countries concerned. Nothing to do with anyone
else. If a military  - even a "defensive one" is undertaken - it will be
seen as the US interfering again: the millions of muslims, africans, south
americans dont care if the US is nuked from within or without. Many want to
see the end of capitalism: with US out of the way that makes building their
own countries easier.
  This attack, bizarre and terrible as it is, is part of the ongoing
interaction and continuimg struggle which often takes many bizzarre
unforseen and contradictory turns. No action by the US ...except the
increasing REAL democratisationof it..will change anything in the long term.
This situation is actually very similar to the Vietnam thing. In a way oit
signals a good thing: that NO super power, no arrogant "policeman state" is
ever going to be free from military or any other counmter action. Blast here
blast there: give them 10 years and new "heads" of hydra opposition will
have sprung up. remove and stoip ALL foreign intervention of a "policeman"
kind and start some real changes toward a more egalitarian world and you're
talking.
     China will survive anby war. China and India and Africa may soon be the
seats of the new civilisations.
 Let he who is without sin caste the first stone. Workers of the world
unite!Richard.

Arielle,

From a Buddhist perspective one feels compassion for the innocent victims of
the WTC attack AS WELL AS for the terrorists who perpetrated the attack.
Violence burns those who engage in it.

From a Buddhist perspective one feels compassion for the innocent Afghani
people who (as collateral damage) will become the innocent victims of US
retaliation AS WELL AS for American soldiers ordered to carry out the
strategic retaliatory strikes.  Violence burns those who engage in it.

Sometimes strong action IS necessary; some people are unable to understand
anything except firm words & firm actions. But before engaging in such
actions, one examines oneself to see whether the mind is balanced,  Whether
we have only love & compassion for the person who is misbehaving.  If so,
the action will prove helpful, if not, it won't really help anyone. Acting
from love & compassion we cannot go wrong.

I have yet to feel that the posts of those advocating retaliation (except
for the Dali Lama's comments which someone forwarded to this list) are
motivated solely by love & compassion. Exhibitions of threadbare brain power
though no doubt sincere in their desire to be fair &, in these troubled
times, wise & perhaps even kind, still unable to see clearly,
perspicaciously.  Thus, like most everyone else, tripping over slogans,
labels, concepts, ideologies of left & right, good & bad .... makes one sad,
very sad.  One wonders, when reading the posts of some of the most
articulate poets & critics, if this poetic community & it's various agendas
have in fact the capacity to produce a deeper humanity, a more enlightened
consciousness or shall we expect no more then glibness, more shine, &
nothing more harmful or benign then ARTICULATION. I would hope not.

With metta,
Reuven BenYuhmin

Because answers suggest a certainty I do not feel, I
am going to try and respond to the posed questions by
posing questions.

> 1) If an attack on your own soil is not enough to
> justify going to war, what act would justify a call
> to arms?

If to be 'just' denotes conforming to what is right,
and so 'justified' denotes having been made right, or
denoted by a governing body as right -- who is this
that justifies? Whose morality determines what
justifies violence?  Does the question 'what act would
justify a call to arms?' hold within in it an already
justified assumption that a call to arms is an
appropriate response to mortal threat?


Assuming a morality that includes a justified
violence, what are the terms of such justification?
Is mortal threat justification enough? If not, exactly
what is?   I'm thinking that unjustified violence
against One might suggest the possibility of justified
violence; but are there universal categories 'right'
and 'wrong' or do competing demands tend to generate
opposing working definitions of 'right' and 'wrong'?

> 2) If the Taliban has "legitimate" grievances
> against the policies of the United States, should we
> help them rebuild their country so that their

> religious minorities could be even more effectively
> administered?

Is this the only choice other than violent action?

Is life under a repressive regime worse than death at
the hands of a regretful attacker?


> 3) Are the only innocent civilians that matter
> living outside the United States?

Did anyone claim such a distinction between 'innocent'
civilians?  Does the situation necessitate a choice
between 'our' innocent civilians and 'their's'? Are
those people living under a repressive regime possibly
less responsible for the acts of their government than
those living in a democracy?


> 4) Is what remains of the "Left" as disconnected
> from normal, everyday people as the majority of the
> traffic on this list would indicate?

Does this question imply a natural good in the
category of 'normal and everyday people'?  Is what
makes someone 'normal and everyday' that s:he agrees
and complies with the prevailing moral code, the
definitions of 'just'?  What is the prevailing moral
code? Why do you and/or do you believe it is just?

Mime-Version: 1.0

The point can be briefly, and rhetorically, stated: violence is as American
as apple pie. This includes genocide of native peoples, mass displacement
of civilians and destruction of "infrastructure" on which the lives of
civilians depend as a military objective in the Civil War, use of atomic
weapons on civilian populations in WWII, and mass bombings that do not
distinguish between civilians and military in Vietnam and the Gulf War.
Some of these are in fact American inventions (think of the use of napalm
and defoliants, for instance, in Vietnam; cluster and other antipersonnel
bombs in the Gulf War), and some even basic to American "character." I
would put the stockade mentality ("draw in the wagons") and manifest
destiny in that category, leading to the rise of cowboy poetry ("wanted
dead or alive"). Not too debatable. What is debatable is that to point this
out is to diminish the acts of Genghis Khan, the Royal Air Force, or other
horrors of war.

I want to thank Nick, Barry, and others for their interventions in the flag
debate. I too think Nick's call for understanding and empathy is important.
It helps us, as Nick writes, to explain behavior that might otherwise appear
incomprehensible--or, in this case, to understand behavior that is all too
comprehensible in terms that might not always apply to particular instances
of a particular behavior (displaying the American flag). But I think there's
a danger we should acknowledge in turning to the empathetic response. I can
understand and empathize, for example, with the heroin addict who steals
money from his own mother, but that doesn't mean that I also condone or
ignore those actions (and I know that this is not what Nick implies).
Understanding and empathy must be accompanied by critique and alternative
possibilities.

The flag might very well function as a transitional object for someone
undergoing traumatic stress and desubjectivization. But one particular
idiosyncratic use of a symbolic object does not at the same time erase that
object's symbolism, its social mediation. That is where a flag and a rock
differ. I have a conch shell that my grandmother owned. For me that shell is
a metonymic embodiment of my grandmother now that she is gone because of my
associations of that shell with my grandmother. But this association is
purely contingent and idiosyncratic--almost nobody else would ever think to
associate the two objects. And beyond that, that shell is NOT a symbol but a
metonym. The flag, on the other hand, is a socially-constituted symbol of
the United States, a symbolism which is also overladen with other layers of
symbolism and associations--patriotic pride, militaristic response,
imperialist power, etc. What, we might ask, does the United States as a
concept itself symbolize in a given moment and set of circumstances? The
swastika has (at least) one set of associations in Buddhist tradition and
yet quite another in Nazi tradition, yet in this global symbolic economy a
purely Buddhist presentation of the swastika is impossible--the Nazi
associations will override all else. (And I am not implying some connection
between Naziism and our current situation--that I even have to explain this
illustrates my point.)

We cannot erase the historical symbolic determinations of an object at will.
The flag cannot stop symbolizing the vast array of objects and emotions
attached to it simply by using it in some new and idiosyncratically
transitional way. Yes, the flag now functions as a symbol of national
solidarity, but what in turn is the effect and consequence of that
solidarity? How is that solidarity itself shaped and determined in the
struggle over discursive hegemony? It seems to me that the solidarity now
symbolized by the American flag is one with the slogan United We Stand. The
two cannot at this moment be separated. But what is the nature of this
Unity? Who is this collective subject designated as We? What exactly is our
Stand? The answers to these questions are exactly what is at stake right
now. We (and I'm not just referring to Americans here) are all engaged right
now, willfully or not, in a hegemonic struggle over symbolic legitimacy.
What is the symbolism of the attack on the Towers and the Pentagon? That is
still up for grabs. How does Bin Laden function symbolically right now? The
answer to that has life-and-death consequences. And the answers to these
questions are already being laid out for us by the Bush administration.

What will NOT help us at this moment is to conflate several different potent
images such as the recent attacks and the Nazi death camps. What we need
right now is a separation out of the various symbolic trajectories already
implicit in an object such as the flag and an open contest over how those
trajectories will be determined and instantiated as actions.

"We have no issue and no anger toward the citizens of Afghanistan" said
President Bush, yesterday, standing beside Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi
of Japan. You will recall his father eleven years ago said the same thing
about the people of Iraq ("we have no quarrel with the people of Iraq")
right before he directed the complete flattening of that country and the
subsequent criminalization of offering help to those same people which
lasts to this day.

Well, presidents are full of rhetoric and shit almost everytime they speak
publicly. That's because we, as citizens, need it all dumbed down for us.
So the smoke Bush is going to use to root out evil in faraway places is
very similar to the smoke he feels the need to blow up our asses in
preparation for the loss and deprivation to come.

Before the Gulf War I remember the large amounts of media-talk that
emphasized Iraq's forces as an entrenched, massive army of battle-hardened
veterans. It was not going to be easy to force them out of Kuwait,
especially once the US sent ground troops in. As it turned out, the air war
had so overwhelmingly incapacitated what was left of Iraq's army that US
troops hardly encountered any opposition. Many of those they found were
very willing to surrender. And as the decade of the 90s matured we learned
more and more that the Iraqi army had not been all that formidable a foe in
the first place.

This time the official responses being given to us vary a great deal. Some
days we're going only after targeted cells, like a drug raid. Other days
(tho this rhetoric has been toned down a lot) we're going to bring death
and destruction to all who harbor terrorists and, in some cases, "end"
entire states.

Now it's been two weeks since the US was attacked. And don't get me
wrong---I'm as pissed off and angry and emotional and upset about the
murder of nearly 7000 people as the next guy, gal, or poet. Yes, I would
like to BELIEVE that the government's response will be to find only the
terrorists linked to the "network" believed responsible for the attacks.
But I don't believe they will. And much like poor Codrescu, glued to his TV
somewhere, all we can do is wait. Some of us will fly flags, some of us
will attend peace rallies, and some people are actually in the military and
doing what they're trained to do. But nothing can convince me that an
attack that kills civilians in Afghanistan (for starters, perhaps elsewhere
too) is not just as horrible and murderous as the attacks here in the US.

These are the days immediately before the war. If the US does not make any
kind of repsonse (that is, not even pursue the people responsible; I'm not
for that) there is a chance (not the inevitable fact Prof. Perloff claims)
the US would be attacked again. WHEN the US responds, does the chance of
more attacks increase or diminish?

One of the things that continues to bug me about Ron's "What is to be done"
post (9/18) is the suggestion that "reframing" "the assault as 'criminal'
rather than as an act of war" amounts to "pussyfooting". This is the kind
of thing you expect to read in a George Will or William Safire column. If
it is an act of war, then the US can respond with warlike activity. In
fact, it demands return acts of war in self-defense. And thus, another
Iraq, whose invasion of Kuwait was an attack on the US itself (in the
"framing" of it by Bush, 1990). "We" had no problem with the people of Iraq
or Afghanistan, just their horrible rulers (one of whom we gave a 43
million dollar grant to last spring to support their noble ban, or "war,"
on drugs, i.e. opium), or in this case, their friends. Unfortunately, the
ordinary people of these countries have neglected to overthrow their
dictators so naturally the US can hardly be blamed if they are in the way
of the crusade against terrorists and evil.

See today's Washington Post
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26290-2001Sep26.html>,
Michael Kelly's column, for how a pacifist position amounts to supporting
terrorism and is in fact pro-terrorist and pro-fascist. Such people are
"against" the US, which is called treason in times of war.

PS: I made a reference in my post (9/24) about Saddam Hussein withdrawing
from Iraq. Of course I meant Kuwait.

Hey everyone,

If you want to escape the bullseye: Please consider the benefits of St.
Louis, MO.  We are very friendly and it's easy to take a "drive in the
country" in any direction.

Need some fresh water? Check out the Missouri, Meramec and Mississippi
rivers.  Talk about confluence!

Also, there are only a few writers/artists here; no clamor of scene, styles,
or worry of fashion.

Think of St. Louis as Canada with baseball and real dollars.

I'm sure you'd love being called a CanadianAmerican.

The citizens of every country in the Americas are easily named,
and--except for those of us from the USA--aren't reasonably called
simply Americans (they are North, Central or South Americans).  And
I speak as one who thinks Canada and the USA are just an oversprawl
of England.  London is still my final capital.

interviewer in the aftermath of the attack: "I just think we are a little bit of an arrogant nation and maybe this is a little bit of a humbling experience ... what has our government done to provoke this action that we don't know about?"

The tentatively put-forth query apparently raised the ire of some of his more patriotic compatriots. And so, Thursday morning, Richardson took to the airwaves to clear things up.

"My thoughts weren't put together quite properly," the penitent pop star explained to Z100's Paul "Cubby" Bryant. "We had been doing about five interviews in Toronto, Canada ... and as I was sitting there listening to the rest of the guys talk, I just got overwhelmed with anger and frustration, on 'how can this happen in our country, in this nation that we live in?'"

What he meant by "arrogant," he said, was that "we've been a little overconfident, we've maybe taken our freedom for granted, taken our security for granted."

"I apologize if I have offended anyone, any of the families of the victims, if my statement seemed insensitive, but I was reacting out of anger and out of frustration, and I was emotional," Richardson continued. "I don't want anyone to think that I don't love this country ... I'm proud to be an American. I apologize if my comment was untimely.">>

The moderator of this list told me that he was very sensitive about "ad
hominem" attack (in response to a censored reaction of mine to Taylor's
reference to the beauty of burning towers). I supposed Sasq's post can not be
considered "ad hominem" because it is a menacing to "everybody." Absolutely
disgusting really.

CAUTIONARY THOUGHTS MANIFESTO  Re: The American War on Terrorism (second
take)

                        dedicated to innocent victims everywhere & the
memory of their life & unwarranted deaths

"Sunday night, and on Wall Street a foul wind
blows newspapers along the empty sidewalk. Wall St. with stars
eerie and empty. The bank windows dark
though not all. A few rows lit up
in the black monstrosities. They can be identified:
the foreign departments of the big banks.
The iron doors barred and padlocked.
But by back doors some people have entered
the foreign departments. The lights -- secret meetings,
decisions we're unaware of (and their cigar smoke
rising like shares) but they affect us all.
Devaluation sparks off a riot in Malaysia, buses burned
and blood flows in the streets like water from a hydrant.
At the hour that the stars shine over Wall Street
and the hour the banks open in London.
                                                          -Ernesto Cardenal
                                                           from COSMIC
CANTICLE
                                                            (1970s)
"All I have is a voice
To undo the folded lie,
The romantic lie in the brain
Of the sensual man-in-the-street
And the lie of Authority
Whose buildings grope the sky:
There is no such thing as the State
And no one exists alone;
Hunger allows no choice
To the citizen or the police;
We must love one another or die."
      (WH Auden,  "September 1, 1939", received compliments of Alice Notley)

Umberto Eco, semiologist-philosopher, reminds us of the three ways cultures
clash: the members of Culture A cannot recognize the members of Culture B
as human beings (and vice versa), seeing them as "barbarians" to civilize
or destroy, which is the Conquest Model.  In the Cultural Pillage Model,
Culture A must steal from B and colonize or subjugate politically or
militarily and in that way undermine and usurp the invaded culture. The
Exchange Model is a two-way process of reciprocal support, often
"influence" in the best sense and respect.

*Always invoke Model Three!

It is a fact, woefully, that Western culture (European civilization) has
been most engaged with the first model  - and, as just one example,
subjugated African and Ameridian cultures with unmerciful acts of cruelty.
And that now, more particularly America - the richest and most powerful
country in the world  - the "cop of the world" - acts and has acted with
unmitigated and brutal economic self-interest in many parts of the globe.
Because of media control (particularly since the American War in Vietnam)
Americans do not fully comprehend the damage we have inflicted on Iraq. And
now do not understand the "karma" of that conflict which galvanized so much
hatred of the US. Or how the indignities that the Palestinians have
suffered in Israel/Palestine  have led to such loathing and call for
"jihad". I was in Germany during the Gulf  War and was shocked by the
contrast in media coverage between the States and abroad.  I  only heard
Ramsay Clark speak live  of the devastation of Basra (bodies in the
streets, no water to drink)  via transmitted reports from Cuban radio.

* Demand comprehensive, intelligent, reliable and mature media coverage
from television (where is where most of America & a lot of the world is
getting its news).  Support the  alternative media! Does it only take a
tragedy to subsist from constant pushing of the Market?  It seems shameful
that only a week after the terrorist attacks in the US we were back to
business as usual, slick advertising pushing the American  Economic Way,
theme music for the American War, sentimental ads to push cell phone biz to
communicate with loved ones. And endless repetition/assault of images that
invoke patriotism and revenge.

After Operation Desert Storm a UN mission to Iraq reported that the Gulf
conflict "wrought near-apocalyptic results" by destroying "most means of
modern life support", relegating Iraq to a "pre-industrial age".   Again,
is it any wonder that citizens of that country, as much as they might be
under the iron rule of Saddam Hussein abhor America and everything it
stands for?  As we know, as has been proven, they are not alone in this.

Or the instability we brought to South & Central America, Indonesia, the
Caribbean historically in support of corrupt governments that were in our
interest to support.  In a recent conversation with Ernesto Cardenal  -
Nicaraguan Catholic Priest, poet, and former Minister of Culture under the
Sandinistas - the suggestion was that karmically the US helped create Osama
Bin Laden (& others like him), through a variety of actions, but most
particularly the US covert (CIA) support against Russia in Afghanistan on
which side Bin Laden fought.  Bin Laden also later saw arrogant  US
presence in Saudi Arabia which he resented.  His call for jihad, his
heinous words against America and Jews are the product of a sick and
twisted yet ideological-based  seemingly "righteous" mentality. Ernesto
also noted that Bin Laden helped support the Contra movement against the
Sandinistas who had overthrown the brutal dictatorship of Somosa who was
supported by the US!  (This is documented in an Oliver North biography,
although Bin Laden has said he didn't know what he was funding).  Poet
Andrew Schelling's response to this information: "after all the Soviets were
supporting the Sandinistas. The enemy of your enemy's friend is of course;
your friend.  Bin Laden's just a Machivellian militarist/politician with
vast sums of money, & a crazy agenda, who loves god but hates humans."

* Invoke Investigative and documentary Poetics! Know the score! Know the
history!

The  TV pundits and media cannot keep mindlessly repeating the simplistic
notion that these recent horrific disasters are merely an attack on
America's "freedom" in light of such demented, albeit complex history and
the grinding truth of cause and effect.  It is insulting to our dignity as
free-thinking individuals. Bin Laden - if he is the mastermind - is another
hardened player in the big "game". He can play both sides in his agenda.
Glamorizing him as a "holy warrior" would be idiotic as well.  His
agenda, presumably , is to rid the Middle East of US presence. Any ends -to
that goal  -justify the means.

* Study the nature of power-politics!

In Buddhist psychology one of the Six Realms of Existence includes the
Warring God Realm which is a super-intelligent paranoid realm of energetic
activity in which enemies have to be created and maintained in order for
the  neurotic mind to function and  thrive. It operates on the notion of
revenge.  This states manifests in an endless cycle of balance and checks
around power and perpetuates suffering, and yet its strategies, to some,
are fascinating, compelling even, and may suck one in.

*Check out the Warring God realm of every day existence! US Military budget
could go as high as $400 billion this year and higher in the future.  You
know where your dollars are? Are we insane?

Meanwhile,  an innocent victim of The Warring God Realm could be any one of
us. We can empathize now with innocents who have died  & suffered while the
Masters of War carry out their agendas.  Writing this text from Europe, one
hears countless stories of the suffering of innocent victims during times
of war still within memory. Czech friend writer/translator/scholar lost
an aunt to US bombing during WW II, the US never apologized. Of course
Hitler had to be stopped. The US was late in that conflict.  We know
governments do not always serve the best interests of their citizens.

The situation in Afghanistan is extremely complex.  The Taliban in power
represent only a minority of the Pashto-speaking Afghanis who border
Pakistan.  The nation has been described as a "pre-modern warlord state".
The Pashto speakers are mostly Sunni Muslims, the Persian (Farsi) speakers
are those who look to Iran. the underclass Shiite Heraras speak an archaic
Persian and resemble in physiognomy Tibetans or Nepalis.  Residents of
Bamian were evidently enraged when the Taliban destroyed the magnificent
large twin statues of Buddha there ("bowed to dust"...)  How irresponsible
for the US to portray Afghanistan as a united front to the American public,
dehumanizing the situation.  William Blake implores us to "observe the
minute particulars" and to "look to the little ones".  "God is in the
details" - A. Warburg.

* Discriminating Wisdom ("prajna") Now!  Poetics adages are useful here:
"No ideas but in things" (Williams), "Go in fear of abstractions" (Ezra
Pound) Poets & artists: make your own lists of  sane trustworthy language
measures....

Aren't there sane models for mutual co-existence on this precious planet?
Aren't there any wise leaders (with clout) who may be allowed to speak
sagely  & effectively at this crucial time? And speak with
historical/cultural/philosophical/religious perspective?  Why don't
governments have such counsel in place?  The US  presidential cabinets are
made up primarily of partisan lackeys, often not even trained in their
supposed arenas of expertise.   And they, too, can be bought. Are the
Muslim Clerics the only "body of elders" to weigh in on this? Isn't there a
way of invoking and developing (through UN auspices) a body of mediating
enlightened human beings from all nations and cultures and communities that
aren't simply representing and reflecting their own government's national
interests?  Who holds the whole of existence sacred?  Cannot we have, also,
a body of folk going in just to help (as witnessed powerfully in the
aftermath of the attack in NY)? Not aid groups or religious groups with
ideologies or strings attached, but...

*Form cadres of "boddhisattvas" for mediation, for true compassionate (not
self-serving) action! And bands of articulate poet-warriors!

The US's questionable legitimate presidential leadership, its government's
very recent rejection of the Kyoto accords, its boycott of the UN conference
on racism (related to the situation in Israel/Palestine),  its undoing of
sane and sensible legislation that protects its own citizens (standards for
arsenic levels in water etc) has been most troubling, depressing. Does not
the current scenario, at the brink of a consuming possible war in the
Middle East - simply  benefit this country's hegemonic interest, economy?
Will it root out terrorism or create more terrorism?  Does the US not
showcase its most advanced weaponry once again which will lead to support
of Star Wars and other scary outer space death machines?  Is it not true
that the US wants an oil pipeline through Afghanistan?  And won't we be
paying a heavy price for an "us versus them" mentality, for invoking a
sense of righteous "crusade" and revenge?  Where are the women critique-ing
the use of patriarchal language now when we need them? Where are the
responses of  women  leaders in general as we see unfolding before us
another Macho drama. What are the 3 wives of Osama Bin Laden thinking?  Is
Condoleeza Rice our only  audible voice?  Where is Hillary Clinton in
articulation of the suffering of the Palestinian people now, at the
eleventh hour? Should we now examine our language with perspicuity at this
time?  Should we not explore other less devastating method for uprooting
terrorism and its causes before we inflict more suffering on already
desperate and  suffering peoples?

* Stay vigilant.  Be a guardian of  "right speech"!

Consider the deals that are being made to insure support of US policy
planet-wide!  Will Russia now  even have more permission to persecute its
"terrorists" in Chechnya, will China in Tibet and Taiwan etc etc...

As patriotic US citizen who has always strived to "save America from
herself" and one (with many) who mourns her country's loss,  & who feels
tremendous assault on her home city, and as writer defending creative
expression and the right to dissent and as denizen of the world who aspires
to know the world (& the cosmos)  -understand it, witness it in all its
richness & complexity, - I take a vow for an aspiration of "vipashyana" or
clear-seeing (insight).  The world does not need more war. Pursue the path
of least suffering...

Umberto Eco also invokes the Tower of Babel collapsing as a result of man's
hubris in a salient essay that examines the search for the original
language of the first man.  The plurality of tongues should hardly be seen
as a tragic consequence and yet there is something to be said for an image
of restoration and communication. Is it really too late?

By this merit may all obtain omniscience
May it defeat the enemy wrong-doing...

Sarva mangalam.

I'm pretty sure we don't get it locally.  Others might be interested in the
archives which contain some opposing views on current issues.

    I will be doing a 'scholarly' article on poetic response to trauma for
ASAP, which is a web journal put out by the Society for the Psychological
Study of Social Issues.  This is peer reviewed so no guarantee but also a
journal heeded by policy makers.  The discussions on this list will be a
part of the piece.  Any suggestions appreciated.  I'll be busy trying to
gather 'proof."

No, Sir

because they aren't doing it out of the goodness of their hearts

They KEEP interfering and making it worse - there's always another agenda

I have no faith in your government or mine to get it right

It is in all senses a failure of intelligence

The body to deal with the mess is the United Nations, an organisation which
has been considerably undermined by USA's government, under both Presidents
Dum and Dee

All our economies should contribute to the UN and not make the paying of
dues part of their debating and voting strategy

& that would free all those creative energies to deal with the poverty and
need within USA

Here in UK, the energy spent on destabilising other people's countries would
be much better spent on the many problems we face including riots and civil
war

Dear "Selim Abdul Sadiq",

<sarcasm>HA!  You are so funny.  Boy, to see so many people die is just so
FUNNY!  Thigh-slappin' good times!  Ha ha!</sarcasm>

Thanks for reducing the appearance of your name to a stereotype of complete
ignorance and blind aggression.  I'd wager you're some just some stupid
white guy trying to stir up some predictable reactions (like my own reaction
perhaps) or further the stereotypes of Middle Easterners.  I assure you have
done NOTHING for heteronymity, Mr. "Truthful".  Get back to your Ruthven
text and call me when you finally grasp it.

Now, please be a dear, take your pills, and go to sleep.

Oh yeah, and I won't duck, you quack.  You may have my head.  Here.  I wish
for you a crimson stain on all your shoes.

i think what's wholly misunderstood is that REGARDLESS of what we do THERE
WILL BE ANOTHER ATTACK, whatever form that attack takes -- below we're
encouraged to think that some kind of "action," some kind of "concerted
action," some kind of "something," will stave off further attacks (unless we
do something...), but the exact nature of this "action" is not clarified

isn't the potential delusion that "concerted action by ourselves and our
allies" (however it's defined) will prevent further atrocities precisely
what has inspired some to call for a different way of approaching this
action (as well as our policy actions now and in the future), a way that
doesn't place faith in conventional modes of action? -- doomsday predictions
are unnecessary for several reasons, but if the means currently exist for
further terrorist attacks here in the U.S. (and all reports i've heard
suggest they do), then shouldn't we assume that more is on the way? --
wouldn't it be wise to assume that self-defense, as conventionally enacted
by allied military forces, won't in fact *defend* us against anything?

>I believe this should be an
intelligence war not a bombing one.  But without concerted action by
ourselves and our allies, you won't have to worry about the U.S. being a
nasty Imperialist super power any more.

this seems to imply that "concerted action" somehow stands apart from
"intelligence war" and that both are necessary -- might not the wisest
concerted action turn out to be, in fact, an intelligence war and not a
bombing one? -- NPR reported yesterday that the Bush administration has
launched its first strike on the financial resources of terrorists and their
funders -- this seems wise to me since bomb-making equipment, airline
tickets, and fake IDs cost money, and the less money available the better,
but i would imagine as well that terror funding sources are as ubiquitous
around the world as ATM machines are in the states, so the question remains
as to how these operations will, as C. Rice promised on Fox, "choke off" the
terrorists financially -- but, that aside, is this the first step in the
"intelligence war," or just a prelude to the "concerted action" called for,
albeit ambiguously, here and elsewhere?

to avoid misunderstandings, i ask that the terms of "concerted action" be
spelled out a little more clearly, since these are similar to the terms
currently being issued by Rice and the state department -- does this mean
air strikes and commando missions?  INS sweeps through all 50 states? --
whatever "concerted action" means, i want to know how these actions are
going to *defend* us from the man working at the gas station down the street
from me (La Mesa, CA) arrested last week for providing funds to the
hijackers or, more seriously, his associates most likely still at large in
the U.S.

I think there's one thing that is still wholly misunderstood on this
List and maybe I see it because I'm older (if not wiser) than most of
you.  The reason there has to be action (we can debate what kind of
action) is 99% self-defense, pure and simple.  We can sit and debate the
similarities between our crimes and their crimes till we're blue in the
face, but unless we do something THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ATTACK.  Maybe
not a plane, maybe this time germ warfare or the water supply or a
bridge--whatever.  So far most of the action has been finding the
terrorists--which I applaud since I believe this should be an
intelligence war not a bombing one.  But without concerted action by
ourselves and our allies, you won't have to worry about the U.S. being a
nasty Imperialist super power any more.  Because it may not be here at
all.

Fortunately, about 92% of the country, acc. to polls, seems to
understand this.

Dear Poetix People, On another list there's been a discussion about why
poets are expected to soothe, honor, grieve, whatever, be turned to in the
time of need and expected to produce a something out of this while folks in
other mediums are not. (I'm not sure this is true!) And that it's a bit
insulting when we're and our medium is usually, generally not all that
respected. What do you think?

The discussions on this list lead to some simple questions:

1) If an attack on your own soil is not enough to justify going to war, what
act would justify a call to arms?

2) If the Taliban has "legitimate" grievances against the policies of the
United States, should we help them rebuild their country so that their
deadly, repressive polices against woman and religious minorities could be
even more effectively administered?

3) Are the only innocent civilians that matter living outside the United
States?

4) Is what remains of the "Left" as disconnected from normal, everyday
people as the majority of the traffic on this list would indicate?

Selim. To attack all Americans is stupid....if you aren't joking. All humans
are basically the same wherever they are from. Great injustices may have
been done to country A against country or countries B(but there will always
be an unjust A and an aggreived B) but I (despite my "call to arms" so speak
for the workers of the world to unite which I believe in but realise is a
little rhetorical - after all HOW do we unite?) (and despite I can see the
"good" or "revolutionary" (wake up call so to speak) side of this attack) :
I dont think that those who did it are your feinds or really want progress:
I could understand it more from their point of view if this had happened
during the Vietnam war or the Iraq debacle...but despite my protestations
and defence such countries as Syria and Palestine etc and some very
agonising resentment by Arab or Muslim people: I cannot suppport any nation
or philosophy or religion or anyone who wants to kill ANYONE (meaning
EVERYONE) of another nation: I can understand the emotion and the whys and
wherefores. I as a New Zealander take some but not ALL responsibility for my
own Government's policies...much eg as I disliked Muldoon (right winger) and
Roger Douglas ( great believer in capitalism etc) I have never wanted to
kill either of those persons. My own Government isnt listening to my advice:
they are supporting the US - Am I to be killed because I "support" them...I
may in some ways..may not? I would, if I felt the cause was greater than the
evils caused by acheiving the cause ,join a cause. I was considering joining
the Palestinians to fight but I'm not certain that the resultant from that
situation is going to improve the world or even the immediate situation....a
lot of other things...but its entering into madness to want to kill every
one. This is the Raskolnikov complex...was it that gentleman in "Crime and
Punishment"? I know there are some smug right wingers: but I can disagree
violently (or mildly) say with Ron Silliman, admire his poetry, argue all
sorts of "crazy" things, but at the end of the day we are all dealing with a
human reality here: I dont know Ron Silliman to hate him...the people you
would want to kill you dont even know! Many support your aims, many dont.
Read the Merchant of Venice.....the West and the East SHALL the Twain
meet....Kipling was wrong - very wrong. Neither Christianity nor Communism
nor Capitalism nor Muslimism or any religion or any ISM is greater than a
human face, a human smile or human hand, or a child's smile... To want to
kill (everyone or "all") is to hate yourself: and that is to stop living. At
least in the US and the West (with all the horror in those countries) debate
is allowed and a kind of (albeit troubled ) democracy and so on. To fight
for your cause in self defence is admirable. I dont want to sound
patronising: I've been where you're coming from. But consider: men and women
and children have been through all this before. Rhetoric too many times has
been turned to blood. Richard.

Thanks for bringing a bit of spirit into these discussions.  (I appreciate
it that there are a few leftist progressives poet-intellectuals who see
there's more than just the body and the world...)

I attended Naropa, am an off and on Buddhist, I'd say this:

Keep your state of mindfulness and do what's in front of you with
compassion.  If you're led to speak out, join in, protest or salute, just do
it with a heightened sense of engagement.

Without implying powerlessness, all we can really do is work to our own
enlightenment.  The world will go on with its silly and violent ways...
MAYA.  Though, living as an active Buddhist probably means that we do more
than just sweep the kitchen floor compassinately.  How we live our lives
with love on a day-to-day basis has a lot of impact on those around us.  We
are examples.

Wanting to do something more, though, probably shouldn't come from a sense
of wanting to control the "evil forces" out there... as if what goes on the
world is really 'wrong'... or even 'right' for that matter.

    If you meet Buddha on the road, kill him.

Don't let Buddhism get in the way of living your life and choosing your
actions in response to what's going on around you.

A 21st century Koan:  The Buddha in the stones destroyed.  6,000 die in the
toppling of the towers.  Rage and hatred flow in the rivers of the world.
The clerk at the grocery store asks you, "How are'ya doin'?"  What do you
say?

Now folks what conversation would you rather eavesdrop on:  poets discussing
issue of national security, or national security personnel discussing
poetry?

I agree.

Let's get back to the poetry.

FOR ANYONE IN SYDNEY :

ANTI-WAR COALITION FORMED

 Last Thursday night (Thurs 20 sept), over 200 people
attended an anti-war meeting in Surry Hills, Sydney
and formed a new anti-war coalition - Network Opposing
War and Racism (NO WaR).

  The new Network agreed to call a day of action on 29
September at 11am, Town Hall, Sydney to demand:

                        No to US War
                        No Australian troops or
support
                        No to racist scapegoating
                        Defend democratic rights

  NO WaR also endorsed the Refugee rights rally at
Villawood on Sun 23  Sept at 12 noon and the call for
a rally at 5.30pm at the US consulate on the day
bombing starts or war is declared.

 NO WaR also agreed to organise regular Friday pickets
to protest against racist scapegoating and possible
war and to liaise with the Muslim community to
organise an possible upcoming rally in Auburn.

The meeting also agreed that the Network would be open
to all individuals and organisations who supported the
four demands.

  NEXT MEETING: 7pm, Wednedsay 26 SEPTEMBER - Uni of
Technology, Sydney  (UTS)

I'm not sure whether that last sentence is intended to take in the post
by "sasq" - Selim Abdul Sadiq - or my having forwarded to the list. In
any case, I'd like to make a few comments:

1. In general, I don't like to address my interactions with subscribers
here, for the obvious and historically verifiable reason that such
discussions
tend to initiate a recursive spiral of endless and recriminatory posts to
the
List about the List. The situation is [A.] as dull as any public squabble;
and [B.] by its tendency to a peculiarly school-boyish acerbity, tends also
to make other subscribers reluctant to engage in the business of the List:
which is Discussion. Since almost the entirety of my position here is to
maintain an atmosphere in which people feel that they can have "their say"
without becoming the subject of personally-directed rhetorical violence -
hence my use of the phrase 'ad hominem,' unfortunately gendered - These
consequences are detrimental. The post over which we disagreed, Murat,
fits very neatly into the category that I have elicited, since it was one
in which you repeatedly characterized another subscriber as a "windbag"
and stated that s/he is guaranteed to express the "windbag point of view."
My response to you was also very simple: the points you express in relation
to the discussion are very welcome, but please express them without the
personal insult. In light of this response, I can't help remarking that
the term Censored is a bit inflated.

2. This morning on "The Connection," I listened to two very well-spoken
liberal men - the host, and a writer on the airline industry - discuss the
'unfortunate inevitability' of racial profiling in matters of national and
especially airport security: "You can write well-intentioned memos saying
that it shouldn't happen, but the bottom line is that it will take place."
This brought to mind the number of times, crossing the border from Canada
into the United States, that I have seen brown people standing beside their
car as it is minutely searched by the border guards - in proportion to the
few times - well, once in four years actually - that I have seen white
people in a similar situation. Apparently, it is easy to sympathize, so
long as we keep the "bottom line" firmly in place - though, in this case,
"bottom line" makes a curious bridge between a pervasive financial jargon
and the less widely-esteemed phrase "mud people." Perhaps in reacting to
Selim Abdul Sadiq's post, we might credit its author with an awareness of
the "stereotype of complete ignorance and blind aggression" that is
generally attributed, in the U.S., to people of middle eastern descent;
let's go so far even as to impute an intimate awareness. Perhaps, given an
apparent interest in the nuances of poetry, we might even credit its author
too with the dexterity to momentarily own the disreputable stereotype in
order - having credited us with the dexterity to read this gesture - to
point out its terrible absurdity. But of course, this is all conjecture.

While driving to the office this morning, I heard Garrison Keillor's
"Writer's Almanac" on NPR.  I don't ordinarily pay much attention, but I
suddenly recognized a line.  Keillor was announcing Ray Di Palma's
Birthday, and went so far as to quote the poet!  Maybe we can get Ray

Hi Everyone,

Earthlink, who bought out jps.net, just deleted everything formerly at
<www.jps.net>, including Readme. Fortunately, after winding through the
customer service maze, I found a guy who was able to find the files, and
shift them somewhere else.

The new address for Readme is: <http://home.jps.net/~nada>

You can access the main page there, and link into Issue Four. I need to
change the links everywhere else in the magazine, so for the time being, you
won't be able to link into earlier issues. Until then, you can find a file
in an earlier issue (or the two links pages) by substituting
<home.jps.net/~nada/[file name]> for what was formerly
<www.jps.net/nada/[file name]>.

I'll send a post to the list when the internal links in the magazine have
been changed & are available.

Thanks,

Gary

Nota Bene - this unfortunate situation will not have affected
anyone who received messages from Susan that were distributed
over the Poetics List; the Listserv program having been configured
to reject all attachment-bearing messages. Backchannel messages,
obviously, do not fall into this category.

Belated kudos to Maria Damon for modelling another approach. There is a
logic of relationships, wherein one looks to the effect of one's actions on
the self, the intimate, the local, the global, the universal, and takes
guidance that way. It requires more listening than pronouncing. More
patience than speed. It's hard to follow of course. But very practical I
think.

By now I think it's probably beside the point, but I feel compelled to
point out that nothing I wrote to this list struck me as having much to
do with "the beauty of burning towers." I'm really not sure where you
got this from.

yknow, i feel the need to say this publicly---and a few of my
backchan correspondents will hear echoes here of what i've said to
them personally---but isn't it possible to find a rhetoric, a way of
conducting ourselves (and yes, i think there is a "left" (in the
u.s.) in all of this, you bet) so that we don't alienate one
another?...

i'm pointing to the violence of our own rhetoric... i could extract
any number of critical-theoretical articulations and offer them to
this list as an example of what we *shouldn't* be doing...

but i won't... suffice to say that, if anyone, *i* should have been
most offended e.g. at ron s's "pussyfooting" remark... but i wasn't,
and i suspect this is in part b/c i've known ron for some years (and
for the most part, online), hence there's a degree of trust there...
my point being that we mustn't lose sight of how vulnerable this list
is to the liabilities of anonymity...

and i'm thinking that there's room on our (ok?) side of the fence for
outright pacificism *and* for those (like moi) who believe that the
conflict before us amounts to an international law enforcement
operation (with which the military will be involved somehow, i can't
see how it won't be)... again, no bombing, no civilian casualities as
an objective... i can understand too, as some have argued, that
maintaining a rigidly nonviolent agenda is the most expedient means
of counterbalancing the hawks (ditto for those of you who posit
self-critique as a necessary precondition to any govt action)...

and while i don't see eye-to-eye with this (latter) belief, i don't
think it's something i'm "opposed to," exactly... surely not in the
sense that i'm opposed to carpet bombing afghanistan... i just don't
see nonviolence per se as an effective strategy wrt public discourse
*or*  terrorist realities...

anyway... perhaps, following this line of reasoning, we on the left
won't eat ourselves alive?...

one more thing:  i *do* understand our fearless moderator's chris
alexander's desire not to turn this list into something it's not...
i.e., not to presume that this list is a political entity that can
vote (e.g.) *as* a political entity (see rob holloway's
clarifications)...

at the same time:  the left is very good at splintering itself into
numerous factions, so  good in fact that the result often does not do
justice to the sophistication of thought etc... my way of saying
that, whatever *is* offered to this list by way of petition (against
war, and for some sorta action, what have you) might be understood,
not as the crystalline articulation of theoretically manageable
proprieties, but as a best attempt to gather leftist sentiment into
one document... i've agreed to help rob with this, as i can (even
though i suspect he's more capable than me in this regard)---so if he
*does* manage to put something forth here, it would be nice

it would be nice if it were greeted in this (latter) spirit...

collective action is, after all, the action of a collective, so perceived...

peace,

joe

Poetics-

The Nautilus Institute
(http://www.nautilus.org/admin/about.html) has a
collection of essays re: September 11 written by a
decent variety of people from both the United States
and elsewhere.

http://www.nautilus.org/fora/Special-Policy-Forum/

Here's what they say about themselves:

"The attacks in New York and Washington DC on
September 11, 2001 were global in both origin and
impact. People and nations everywhere on earth will be
affected by the attacks and their aftermath.
Therefore, it is crucial that Americans join with
others around the world to understand why these
attacks happened and what they mean. In this spirit,
we are conducting a Special Forum on the September 11
Attacks as an International Crime Against Humanity."

Of particular interest to me was "Black Tuesday: The
View from Islamabad" By Pervez HOODBHOY at
Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad:

http://www.nautilus.org/fora/Special-Policy-Forum/07_Hoodbhoy.html


And the responses to this essay:

http://www.nautilus.org/fora/Special-Policy-Forum/13_Hoodbhoy_Discussion.html

Some tentative thoughts:

Of course, there are problems with much of what's
being said in the articles, but the Nautilus Institute
is one of the few international security policy
oriented/research organizations in the US that I think
succeeds in fostering useful dialogue amongst a group
of people that tends to be much larger than the usual
suspects in the field (though they are there too).
Anyway, it's worth looking at.

As someone who currently makes a living in this field
(though I mostly work with China and N.E. Asia related
topics) hearing or reading a statement from a DC
policy influential that doesn't sound like it comes
strait out of a Department of Defense (DOD) press
release is a rare relief--but it DOES happen. I've
been surprised to see people (for example Michael
O'Hanlon at Brookings Institute in DC) arguing that
most types of military action on the part of the US
just won't work and won't do anything to solve the
problem. (But he does go on to argue for support of
the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan and so on with no
mention of the results the last time the US government
did that...).

But international security is a conservative field--or
many of the institutions and people that are listened
to the most by the US government and governments
around the world are relatively conservative. That
said, I face a huge dilemma: The report that lands
summarized on a 3X5 index card on the desk of Senator
or Congressman so and so is watered down and was
probably unhelpful and not very imaginative to begin
with, and Senator or Congressman so and so doesn't
automatically pay attention to
anti-war/violence/military action protests.

But the ones planned for DC this weekend will be in
the news, and that will make more of an impression I
hope. The problem though, I find, is that one cannot
really engage in conversation with many policy
influentials unless you're engaging them on their
terms. So, I wonder how we (or I, or one) might change
those terms of engagement. In my work, the two issues
I deal with most are PRC-Taiwan relations and Missile
Defense as it relates to North East Asia. In both
cases what me and my co-workers have been trying to do
is change the terms of the debates...by trying to
bring people together for dialogue that don't normally
even talk. For example--on Missile Defense and NE
Asia--technical experts and regional experts. This
sounds obvious; of course, these people should all
talk to each other. Of course, the US government
should be talking with the PRC etc. But most of the
time it's just not happening.

I've been having conversations with the poets in DC,
with people who are involved with the protests, and
I've been having conversations at work. I've resisted
the urge to put copies of Frank O Hara's "Ode to Joy"
(which Mike Magee read recently when he was here in
DC) in all my co-workers mailboxes, but should I be?
Should I be forwarding the links above to this list? I
want to talk about engagement with different groups
and types of people, but that hardly sounds like a
strategy for a paradigm shift.

Elizabeth Treadwell Jackson <eliztj@HOTMAIL.COM> asks:

<On another list there's been a discussion about why poets are
expected to soothe, honor, grieve, whatever, be turned to in the time
of need and expected to produce a something out of this while folks in
other mediums are not. (I'm not sure this is true!) And that it's a bit
insulting when we're and our medium is usually, generally not all that
respected. What do you think?>

I reply:

I've not heard of anyone turning to poets or poetry at this time. Some
people are turning to politics, I hear. And some people are turning into
statues, but no one that I've heard of (excepting Robert Hass and Billy
Collins in the usual trot on Fresh Air [one must have a token poet or
two]) is turning to, or is much interested in, poetry.

Personally, I wish people WOULD turn to poetry. I wish Congerss
would meet in a joint session and read Oppen's "Of Being Numerous"
on national TV.

Less Bible, More Poetry! We might not find "answers" but we would
most assuredly find better questions than those currently circulating.

Thanks to Don Byrd for forwarding this thoughtful and informative article--
which I assume is the sort of analysis some on this list would call a
"knee-jerk leftist" response.  Since many posts to the list have presumed
those who do not favor blind retaliation also advocate "no response," let me
just add that this article outlines a framework from which a sane,
intelligent and (I think) moral response can proceed.  The article also
explains clearly why a purely miltary response won't be effective.  I'm not
necessarily opposed to SOME well-defined military action, if it can be
established that it is the only way to achieve particular objectives, & if
every care is taken to ensure that innocent people are not harmed.  ONE of
the reasons I oppose an open-ended, vaguely defined, rah-rah war such as
Bush (if not Powell) has proposed, is that I think-- and I am speaking now
directly to Marjorie Perloff-- it will increase the likelihood that MANY
MORE attacks WILL occur, by sowing more enmity & bitterness among those who
already despise us.  (Notice I do not entertain the fallacy that NO MORE
attacks will occur; I am merely concerned with reducing their frequency &,
one hopes, their severity).

I do think that, despite his eloquence which I will acknowledge, Ron
Silliman is wrong that the left should not engage in a principled critique
of the means of response.  Lose its credibility?  It HAS none, & has had
none (in the ABC News/Time Magazine sense) since the Civil Rights movement.
*Liberals*, maybe-- but the Left?!!!  (Ron Silliman, you of all people know
the difference).  If anything, the left (no capital L) has credibility to
GAIN by engaging in a principled, coherent dialogue on national policy.  The
problem is that the left/Left has already been shut out of any effective
means of engaging in such a dialogue.  (Protest, yes; dialogue, no).  With
the exception of the Civil Rights & Anti- (Vietnam) War, movements, & some
early (and very hard-won) successes of labor, can you tell me, Ron, any time
in "USAmerican" history where the l/Left HAS had this facility?  Ron is
right that certain lines of argument are more self-defeating than others;
for example, posts to this list that have tried to address the historical
context of the U.S.'s role in the Mid-East have been met with the
presumption that these were attempts at justification of the attacks, while
in most cases I think this is utterly false.  Nevertheless, there is a
*knee-jerk* response to any line of argument, it seems, that seeks to
contextualize the event in order to MORE INTELLIGENTLY RESPOND.  (C.f.
Andrei Codrescu-- & thanks to Dan Bouchard, by the way, for forwarding an
excerpt of his remarks).  If this is the reaction of, presumably, trained
scholars & thoughtful poets, I don't think it would be fruitful to pursue
this line of analysis in a more public forum.  I think, rather, that the
case to be made might rest in part on comparisons to the Israeli/Palistinian
violence in the Mid-East & the Catholic/Protestant violence in Northern
Ireland.  Can any sane, reasonable person honestly claim to believe that
violence in these arenas is not self-perpetuating-- almost an "industry"
unto itself?  Surely, this is a cycle we do not want to see our country
drawn into.  Further, as Byrd's forwarded article points out, there is no
"there" to go to war with.  Terror has no boundaries; it is diffuse &
far-reaching.  The only conceivable response that could have any impact
toward making us any safer, rather than just FEELING like we're the great
big superpower world champions, is one that combines intelligence (by which,
sadly, I mean the CIA & FBI), international law (remember that, George?),
vigilance & the credible threat of military response-- but one that is only
deployed sanely, to achieve very defined objectives.  (Yes, I do mean
ABSOLUTELY NO nuclear weapons.  The fact that Bushie, as my daughter calls
him, says their use is even being considered, is a shame & a scandal).

Finally, I want to say something about knee-jerk responses.  Ron Silliman is
right to caution us against them.  I think that poetry, & art in general,
can serve a unique purpose right now in that its very modus is one which, at
its best, undermines received ideas, unquestioning assent & piety.  I think
that everyone on this list should write a poem today.  Better yet, write
two, & pass on the impulse to post some further insight on the uses of the
U.S. flag.  You'll feel better, I guarantee, because you'll actually be
doing something that could begin to have an impact.

Love,

Mark DuCharme

Elizabeth,
A musician friend just expressed interest in "what you've been writing since
Sept. 11" and I found it hard to explain that there wasn't really anything
yet.
I was a student of music in Los Angeles during the riots. We had a
discussion in a music history class about the role of the musician/artist in
general during such crises. I remember our professor asking if we felt as if
carrying on with our usual activities was tantamount to "fiddling while Rome
burned." I don't recall if we came to any conclusions, but the discussion
was useful.
I also remember turning the sound off on the television and watching images
of the city burning to the sounds of Pink Floyd.
I think part of our job ("us" being poets here) is to reframe -- but not to
help digest, which is what the expectation to "produce" feels like.
Best,
Laura

THE NEW TRADITIONALISTS COMPOSITIONAL AND IMPROVISATIONAL MUSIC
Contemporary folk-pop and progressive instrumentalists, solos and duets.
Featuring saxophonist Marlon Ariola with drummer Ryan Sawyer, clarinetist
Patrick Holmes with violist Dylan Willesma, and songwriter/ guitarist/
vocalist Theo Eastwind. Each musician is in pursuit of a personally defined
mode of expression that represents and transcends the preeminent styles of
the instrument based on Modern American Music. This is a night of acoustic
music, St. Mark=B9s "unplugged" as it were. A pared down evening of
progressive jazz hybrids and sing-along American folk-rock. Everybody=B9s
chops have been honed religiously on the streets and subway tunnels of New
York City proper.


Monday, October 8th at 8 pm
AARON KUNIN and CORT DAY
Aaron Kunin teaches film, curates the Mellon Poetry Seminar at Johns Hopkin=
s
and is currently at work on a Ph.D. in the English department at Duke
University, where he specializes in the Renaissance. His poems have appeare=
d
in The Germ, Jubilat, and Pierogi Press.  Kunin=B9s experimental fiction
explores the interior design of ideas while his poetry blurs the boundaries
between translation and creation.
Cort Day=B9s work has appeared in numerous journals, including American
Letters and Commentary, Boston Review, Colorado Review, Fence, and Verse.
His first collection of poems, The Chime, was published by Alice James Book=
s
earlier this year. "=8A Cort Day has produced a work of transgressive
imaginings, calls and responses, chimes and echoes. It is a work by turns,
humorous and darkly erotic, where the ships of reason burn on an ocean tune=
d
to an open frequency. That ocean is poetic speech, drowning the reality
principle in its surges and its deeps."    =8BMichael Palmer


Wednesday, October 10th at 8 pm
FANNY HOWE and KIMBERLY LYONS
Fanny Howe, poet and novelist, teaches at the University of California San
Diego. She is the author of numerous publications including The Quietist,
Saving History, Deep North, The End, One Crossed Out, Nod, and Forged. Her
most recent collection of poetry, Selected Poems, is just out from the
University of California Press and her most recent novel, Indivisible, is
published by Semiotext(e). Rain Taxi calls her "one of contemporary
America=B9s most innovative poets" and states that "her work deserves wider
recognition and readership." And the Chicago Review instructs "=8Athe
intrigued reader has no excuse: get your hands on one of [Howe=B9s] books, an=
d
get cracking."
Kimberly Lyons is the author of Abracadabra (Granary Books, 2000). Mark
Wallace wrote in Rain Taxi (online): "The work has an understated precision
of detail, as well as meditative subtlety." Lewis Warsh said of Abracadabra=
,
"a real opening, a step onwards." Her work was recently translated into
French for the inaugural issue of Double Change (www.doublechange .com), a
French/English online literary magazine. She has been anthologized in An
Anthology of New (American) Poets (Talisman House), and The Portable Boog
Reader (Booglit).

4. Cautions

'Caveat lector': The Poetics List has become increasingly, though
in small proportion, occupied by subscribers who interest themselves
in pseudonymous authorship. The practice, while not encouraged by
the moderators, is tolerated on the grounds that it is no more
practicably eradicable than effectually harmful - not harmful,
that is, until it becomes so on the level of particular, individual
interactions. The feeling, for subscribers unaware of the circumstance,
may be - and perhaps justifiably so - one of having been 'duped.'
That said, we have felt it necessary to caution all subscribers:
read carefully and be sure of your acquaintance as it suits your
personal comfort.

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics List was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its second incarnation,
the list carries over 800 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time.
A number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
at the Electronic Poetry Center (see section 10 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the increasing
number of subscribers, we are no longer able to maintain the
open format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).
All submissions are reviewed by the moderators in keeping with
the goals of the list, as articulated in this Welcome Message.
We remain committed to this editorial function as a defining
element of the Poetics List. Our aim is to support, inform, and
extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of
the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
impossible. We recognize that other lists may sponsor other
possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium. We request
that those participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized
and focussed nature of this project, and respect our decision to
operate a moderated list. For subscription information or to
contact the moderators, write to <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

For further information on posting to the list, see sections 3 and 4.
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 8.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 8
for details.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list should provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators
at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all
of the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and send this one-line message, with no "subject" line
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name. If you
find that it is not possible to unsub using your old address,
please contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by
contacting the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by
the moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated
in this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics
and political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also
welcome. Feel free to query the list moderators if you are
uncertain as to whether a message is appropriate. All
correspondence with the moderators regarding submissions to
the list remains confidential and should be directed to us at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published,
or in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core
function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry events and
publications are always welcome.

Solicited contributions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) may
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The moderators reserve
the right to contact any subscriber regarding possible contributions.

Send messages to the list directly to the list address:

     <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 4 below.
Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 9.

-------------------

4. Cautions

'Caveat lector': The Poetics List has become increasingly, though
in small proportion, occupied by subscribers who interest themselves
in pseudonymous authorship. The practice, while not encouraged by
the moderators, is tolerated on the grounds that it is no more
practicably eradicable than effectually harmful - not harmful,
that is, until it becomes so on the level of particular, individual
interactions. The feeling, for subscribers unaware of the circumstance,
may be - and perhaps justifiably so - one of having been 'duped.'
That said, we have felt it necessary to caution all subscribers:
read carefully and be sure of your acquaintance as it suits your
personal comfort.

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post, since this may make it
difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.
Messages containing attachments will be presumed to be
worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Posting on the list is a form of publication. However, please do
not publish list postings without the express permission of the author!
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without
the author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair
use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 5 messages
per day from any one subscriber; in general, we expect subscribers
to keep their post to less than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is
a manageable list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers)
of twenty-five or fewer messages per day.

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat offenders
will be removed from the list immediately. Please do not put this
policy to test!

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the moderators at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

5. Subscription Options

It is possible to receive the Poetics List as separate posts
or as daily digests. When you subscribe, the default setting is
"regular," meaning you will receive a separate email for each
message distributed to the list.

Regular:
The default option, this is the form in which you will receive
the list if you choose no other. With a "regular" subscription,
you receive individual postings immediately, as they are OK'd
by the list moderator. To revert to this option if you are
currently receiving the list in digest form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain the following text:

     set poetics nodigest

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

Digest:
With a "digest" subscription, you receive larger messages (called
"digests") at regular intervals, usually once per day. These "digests"
are collections of individual list postings. Some lists are so active
that they produce several digests daily; the Poetics List produces
only one, mailed just after midnight EST.

Digests are a good compromise between reading everything as it is
posted and feeling like the list is clogging your mailbox with a
multitude of individual postings.

To receive the Poetics List in digest form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain the following text:

     set poetics digest

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

Index:
With an "index" subscription, you receive a short "index" message
once per day. These "indexes" show you what is being discussed on
the list without including the text of the individual postings. For
each posting, the date, the author's name and address, the subject
of the message and the number of lines it comprises is listed. You
can then follow instructions provided in the index to download
messages of interest from the server.

An index subscription is ideal if you have a slow connection and
only read a few hand-picked messages. The indexes are very short
and you do not have to worry about long download times. The drawback
of course is that you need to maintain your internet connection or
reconnect to order messages of interest from the server.

You can choose to have the index sent to you in either a traditional
format (plain text) or in HTML format with hyperlinks. Using the HTML
index, you may click on a link provided with each message to open your
web browser to that message in the Poetics List archive.

To receive the Poetics List in index form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain, for the text-only
index:

     set poetics nohtml index

And for the hyper-link index:

     set poetics html index

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Please do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

     set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 9 below.)

-------------------

7. "No Review" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information.

-------------------

8. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

The EPC's mission is to serve as a gateway to the extraordinary
range of activity in formally innovative writing and digital media
poetry in the United States and around the world. The Center provides
access to extensive resources in new poetries. These include our
E-POETRY library, our links to digital VIDEO and SOUND (including
our award-winning LINEbreak series of radio interviews and performances)
as well as e-journals such as lume, Deluxe Rubber Chicken, Alyricmailer,
and many others, the POETICS List archives, an AUTHOR library of
electronic poetry texts and bibliographies, and direct connections
to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides
information about contemporary electronic poetry magazines and print
little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics.
Visit the EPC's many libraries, the featured resources available on
the EPC home page, or its NEW listings, where recent additions are
available for quick access.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

-------------------

9. Poetics Archives at the EPC

Go to the Electronic Poetry Center <http://epc.buffalo.edu>
and select the "Poetics" link from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. Or set your browser to go directly to
<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html>.

You may browse the Poetics List archives by month and year or
search them for specific information. Your interface will allow
you to print or download any of these files.

Please note that it is possible to toggle between proportional
and non-proportional fonts in viewing archived messages; a
feature that may be useful to interpret messages reliant on
the neat spacing of a proportional font, or that require the
"word wrap" feature of same - and useful, too, for aesthetic
reasons. To change the display font of an archived message,
simply follow the "proportional font" or "non-proportional font"
link at the top of the message.

I got the point that the author knew he was playing a provocateur role.
Please read my post again.  I think he should be able to post away like
this, and I should be able to tell him it's idiotic.

And yes, in case you did not catch my pointing it out the first time, I
believe that if I am not mistaken the last name "Sadiq" DOES mean
"truthful."  It seems I caught the "joke" the first time and pointed that
out.  It was also my point to say it was not funny, or even interesting, and
it probably is a very poor attempt at heteronymity (for better examples see
KK Ruthven's _Faking Literature_.)

Most of all, the post was in incredibly poor taste.  Some of us have friends
that were vaporized that day.  It's not HA HA at all.  For some of us it
wasn't just spectacle on some television.  Besides, I get better attempts at
poetry from drunk North Carolina frat boys writing poems about their feces.
At least their poor taste isn't so caustic.  But again, maybe I just don't
get off on the sadism of others.  Even sadism in jest is still sadism.

I'm sincere in recommending pills and sleep.

I'm all for heteronymity.

e.g., see Lester's up-and-coming journal now in development:
http://proximate.org/CloseQuarterly/

I'm not for stupidity.

And I'm glad my criticism of such stupidity is welcomed here.

Best,
Patrick

Elizabeth,

>>High are doing teach-ins on tolerance. So again my townie cap to them.

My hat as well to the students at Berkeley High.

However, one should investigate the charged scenario at UCB before
announcing its "babyishness" to the world at large; the peace movement,
gaining in momentum and helping initiate a National Student Day of Action
last Thursday which affected over 150 campuses across the country, including
NYU and Columbia, has of course been filtered by the media (when it
miraculously makes it to the media) to seem divided and overwhelmed by a
handful of shallow hecklers at a single rally.  I would like to point out
that there has been a steady series of teach-ins at UC Berkeley following
the tragedy--on alternatives to war, on understanding the complexities of
U.S. involvement in the Middle East, on race hatred, and more.  In fact,
there has been a teach-in every day for the past week.  As well as a
days-long sit-in and its inevitable arrests regarding a racist political
cartoon printed by the university newspaper--and a rally/march attended by
thousands.  I am not responding because I am personally offended.   I am
responding because if fellow members of the left indulge in this kind of
splintering finger-pointing to patronize our quite serious attempts at
reeducation, we will never be able to cull the respect necessary to get a
hearing from either end of the political spectrum.  It's enough just to deal
with the attendant abuse from self-proclaimed "patriots."

Thank you in advance for your future cooperation and respect.

One of the things that I've been pondering the past two-plus weeks, is the
way in which everybody, regardless of political persuasion, has referred to
the "events of September 11," the "recent incidents," etc. Very much as
though our language has yet to find a word or phrase that can encompass our
experience.

Hi Everyone,

I'm forwarding a note I got today from Sofie Qureshi about an event taking
place in San Francisco in mid-October. I'm not sure if they're still looking
for participants or not, but if you're interested, you can e-mail her at:
Qsofie@aol.com  --G

* * *

Hey gary is anyone on the poetics list in the bay area? i'm trying to
publicize this event we're having. i don't have an electronic flyer for it
but here's some info to pass on if you kindly will.

thanks,

sofie

1. In response to the devastation of September 11, and the actions and
reactions that followed and have been proposed, the Anthropology Program at
the California Institute of Integral Studies is hosting a Dialogue for
Peace.

(FYI, The California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) was founded in
1968, and is an accredited institution through WASC -- Western Association
of Schools and Colleges.  It is a progressive graduate (and undergraduate
completion) institution in San Francisco.

The Anthropology Program at CIIS was founded in 1981, and offers a critical,
activist approach to education that prioritizes issues of social and
ecological justice in the context of a multicultural, postcolonial world.

The Program deeply engages the intersections of thought and action, critical
social analysis, emancipatory research, strategic thinking, and alliance
building.

www.ciis.edu/graddegree/sca.html

2. The Dialogue is scheduled for Friday, October 12, 2001, 6-9 pm.

3. Venue: auditorium. Address:  California Institute of Integral Studies.
3rd Floor. 1453 Mission Street. (Between 10th and 11th.) San Francisco,
California - 94103. Phone: (415) 575 6100.

4. We are seeking to invite persons that can speak to the following:

i. Tuesdays devastation (September 11).

ii. Hate actions against ethnic minorities post-Tuesday.

iii. Proposed war/armed action in the Global South.

iv. US foreign and trade policies.

v. Ecological, political and social issues in peace and war.

5. We are seeking to invite people from multiethnic, multi-faith and
multi-political backgrounds, who are involved in responding to the above
through diverse strategies. We propose to frame the first 'Dialogue' as a
speak-out, where invited persons from multiethnic/national, faith and
political affiliations speak briefly (about 5-10 minutes each), joined in by
others attending, with some time for discussion. In the speak-out format we
will listen and acknowledge, but not respond directly to each other, during
the first meeting. It is an important method used in numerous alliance
building contexts, and one we will utilize to begin our dialogue.

I am also writing with optimism that the present crises will coerce us to
commit to justice with greater resolve, and address institutional and
structural issues that have prompted organized acts of terror, on the part
of States and other institutions, with immense consequences over the last
few decades in the Global South and North.

We need to be in strong solidarity with Palestinian communities, and
devastated Muslim communities in Afghanistan, and persist in our efforts to
end their diaspora and dispossession, the terror and destruction within
which their lives are lived in the Middle East.

Those in the United States Academy working with social and environmental
justice must offer leadership in calling for citizens action and
governmental resolve in the US toward affirmative action and ethical foreign
and trade policy. In doing so, perhaps we will question the methods we
employ. It becomes necessary to ask how we might labor in the production of
thought and action that addresses wretched histories.

quick thought - poetry as a way of processing?  I know I do this when I read
or write but I'm not sure what to call the action - poeting?  aesthetic
doesn't work here for me as it has taken on the connotation of 'pretty
non-action' is there a term for 'aesthetic action' that would work?

off the top of my head. I may have posted your bc here to the list.  sorry
if you didn't intend this but I'm looking for input on this.

Hello, all. Welcome to crisis, an international e-mail list devoted to the
events of 9-11 and their aftermath, that will bring you analysis,
little-known news, and suggestions for action.
For subscribers not from the United States, we apologize in advance for the
fact that content will be skewed towards the United States. Also, the
posting schedule will be geared to the United States Eastern Time Zone.

We urge international subscribers to stay with us, however. For the first
time, there is a chance of a truly global antiwar movement. The opposition
of any country to U.S. plans for war weakens those plans.

George W. Bush's speech last Thursday was perhaps the most important a
president has given in living memory. For the text, see

http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20010920/us/bush_text.html

In it, he essentially declared unlimited war against an ill-defined enemy,
with the world divided into two polarized camps -- "Either you are with us,
or you are with the terrorists." The Taliban, he said, must "hand over every
terrorist and every person in their support structure." The support
structure, an extremely ambiguous term, at the very least includes cooks,
cleaners, and other innocents. "They will hand over the terrorists or they
will share in their fate." In other words, anyone who doesn't go along 100%
with the Bush Administration's war agenda becomes a target.

For more detailed analysis of the speech, please see:

"Happy New Year: It's 1984" www.commondreams.org/views01/0922-07.htm

"America's Unending War" www.commondreams.org/views01/0921-07.htm

In other news, Colin Powell will apparently reveal some of the evidence the
United States has gathered that allegedly links Osama bin Laden to the
attack.

Government officials are still hinting that Iraq, as well as Afghanistan,
may be attacked. There is a major military mobilization on, with warplanes
going to the Persian Gulf and bases being set up in Uzbekistan, among other
things.

September 20 was a National Day of Action, with large demonstrations around
the country. In many places, thousands of people turned out. We are still
waiting for the results of September 23, but rallies are being held around
the world. September 29 is the next big day of action planned in the United
States and, we hope, around the world.

The Nowar Collective is continuing in its efforts to make
www.nowarcollective.com a Crisis Resource Center. Expect to see the site
dramatically updated within eight hours of receiving this post. The Activism
Directory subsite will be a place to go to find groups organizing in your
area (with contact info), and events planned (with descriptions). To submit
information for the Directory, please write to nowarcollective2001@yahoo.com

If you are interested in forming a chapter of the Nowar Collective in your
area, please write to worker-nowar@lists.tao.ca  Information about how to do
that will be posted shortly.

For other questions, please write to worker-crisis@lists.tao.ca

White House transcript notwithstanding, Ari Flesicher really did say
what he is rumored ot have said. It had been implied that he might have
been misquoted, but if you load up
http://video.c-span.org:8080/ramgen/hdrive/ter092601_whpb.rm and scroll
to about 31:00, you'll hear it plain as day: "Americans need to watch
what they say, what they do."

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

After the terrorist attack - the quartet of airplanes and their hour-long
mathematical ballet - comes a stunned silence. I don't know what to say.
The realization that there are people who want to kill me, based on what I
represent to them, is sobering.

I have known for some time, after all, that my government is willing, if
not eager, to kill. I have sometimes felt as though I am expected to
believe that these killings are done on my behalf, to protect me, but I
cannot believe that I need protection from Manuel Noriega, for example, or
from Grenada. A great deal of what is done supposedly in my name remains a
mystery. Did they lie to me about that plane that went down in
Pennsylvania when they said that a team of brave Americans overpowered the
terrorists and crashed the plane? When one of those brave Americans
reported smoke on the wing and a jet plane circling the area? Was that
plane actually shot down by the military? If so, was that lie told to me
in my name, to protect me? To protect me from the truth?

In order to protest this next war, I can't just bring up from the basement
the signs protesting the last war. Because my feelings won't fit on a
sign. Because slogans are suddenly the problem, not the solution: to use
slogans is to speak propagandistic sound bites back to propagandistic
sound bites. Because even to argue against this next war is already to
have lost the argument. Lost the argument, because someone asked you "are
you still in favor of terrorist attacks?" (a trick question) and you
opened your mouth to answer. Because by opposing this war, you are already
surrendering ground, agreeing to skip the important question "what is to
be done?" by acknowledging that the answer is already war.

If you try to back up to that important and difficult question they will
accuse you of trying to back up even further to the question "is anything
to be done?" or even the question "is it alright to do anything?" "War,
but not this war," your sign says, even though your sign thinks it says
"No War Ever," because your sign does not offer an alternative to
inaction. You are repeating a rebuttal at the exact moment that your
opponent has changed his argument by filling in an important blank. War:
because someone wants to kill you because of what you represent.

This is a moment in history for you, but not for the terrorists, for whom
it is three moments, in 1972, in 1978, and in 2001. It is a line pointing
through history. Perhaps they have been planning the hijackings since
centuries before the buildings were built, since before New Amsterdam was
stolen and the Native Americans living there slaughtered. The terrorists
believe themselves conduits of destiny. From the sunrise of time they have
been coming to get you, even though you are only two and one quarter
centuries old. Your people are a flight across history that has only just
completed takeoff and reached cruising altitude, and you had just loosened
your seatbelt and were starting to relax. All those other wars we fought
and you protested, whether behind your heart or in front of the
courthouse, were against an enemy that could never have killed us. Not
Panama nor Iraq nor former Yugoslavia nor Sudan nor Afghanistan. Many of
those enemies were even individuals, such as Qaddafi and Bin Laden, and so
we bombed the people living in the same country as them, but the
terrorists are a cancer that has metastasized, become undifferentiated,
and sewn itself through the loopholes in our arrogance. They have no
manifestos, no egos, no name, no borders. Victims of history, hypnotized
with hatred, coolly executing effortlessly perfect murders. Living without
lives, planning only for the day they die, leaving nothing but corpses and
newspapers in their wake. Leaving us nothing to look at but ourselves and
our fears and suspicions.

And so this is a critical moment, during which our fears and suspicions
are revealed to us, casting shadows against the rushing whitenoise of a
blank media landscape in which evidence is withheld from us for our
protection. Do we, America, accept ourselves at this moment, for if not,
then everything is already lost and we are a nation at war internally.
But, unlike those other wars that were all silly nonsense about defending
countries you had to seek out on a map or about punishing former allies
turned drug-dealers or about failing to bomb individuals suspected of
being terrorists (but instead blowing up a pharmaceutical factory in one
of the poorest countries in the world), this next war is being fought to
save your life, which is tempting to believe, because there are people who
want to kill you.

"I don't want anybody to save my life," your sign says, though it thinks
it says "I don't want people to be killed."

A sign can have only two colors and signify, but this is not black and
white: there are grey areas here and rich shades of brown. It is not black
versus white, but it must be you versus them, unless you are suicidal too.
Which side are you on? War, no war, war-driven economy, not war-driven
economy, failing war-driven economy, not failing war-driven economy, the
terrorists have won their argument by not having it. You will have a
successful war-driven economy and avenge the terrorists' suicides by
dropping fire on the terrorists' people, proving the terrorists' point.

Or not.

Actually Joel---
I think you were trying to quote this as an example of a soulless
entertainer????
Am I right....
Actually I respect this guy for saying this; and even the "retraction" doesn't
seem so bad...
I mean it's more like John Lennon's famous 1966 "I wasn't knocking it"
thing....

Thanks for posting it; it could be useful for my comp. classes, etc...
(yeah, even one of THEIR heroes agrees with their "crazy teacher" etc....)

Not that I'm going out to buy any BB albums soon....
Is Richardson the guy that was on the tabloids for being too drunk, etc?

Murat. I dont agree: read my reaction. I mean I dont agree with censoring
what the guy said.(or anything I have or did say)...its good to hear many
views...NOT good in my opinion is his position as you'll se in my response
to the guy IF he..well even if he isnt and is just "pissing about" ....I can
understand his response: but I would agree that to go from the kind of anger
and resentment to this position - to want to attack ALL Amercans (any I
suppose in "normal" circumstances) that's different from attempting to
explain or understand.
   I've forgotten what I wrote about "burning towers" - after all it is
eerie that Eliot virtually "predicts" this: clearly tho he was not
"political" (as such) but he was as close in his own way as an extreme
Muslim in some of his own attitudes - look: a volcano eruption is awesome
and beautiful as well as tragic (if people are in the way of it): read some
Shakespear: the patrons to Bill's work revelled in abstract blood shed,
Richard the Third's massacre of the cousins is soon forgotten when he shouts
"A horse! Ahorse! My kngdom for a horse!"  They are fascinated ...as I was
when a (twisted?) young Richard myself) read "I am determined to be a
villain")....there are many sides to the human psyche...as to censor ship :
that's the beginning of fascism!!! Its as bad as killing people, its
undemocratic, and aginst fredom of speech. Its Talebanic.A kind of
undemocratic repression: people will be saying all sorts of things...lets
say them out loud and then react...dont censor - but I think we have to
"know ourselves" and that involves getting into some strange "mind states":
I'm not writing cold ..here in New Zealand I was nearly killed by the police
during protest action (not against the US) ...but it would be true to say
that I havent suffered anything like the horror of this event at the World
Trade: nor have I been even close to starving to death as it looks hundreds
of thousands are now in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
    But I know how you feel about that email of the person who "allegedly"
wants to attack Americans: this is good to hear? Yes and no. Good to KNOW
ABOUT... It at least alerts us to the way people may be thinking. The
question is now why? How do these things arise? In some cases people are
simply "benighted" but in other there are real grievances - which hopefully
can be solved by negotiations not any more attacks etc. We at least can move
in that direction. I'm not going to be "for the US" and nor am I going to be
wholly "against" ...I reserve the right to say what I feel and think and to
disagree with anyone I think is wrong..and change my mind if I'm shown to be
stupid (not an uncommon occurrence!). Hope this puts a better perspective on
things from me. Regards, Richard. PS Unless you meant Taylor...what's his
name? No?

Mark. It may be. But even if it is: it is representative of the way amny
young men from over there may feel. See my response. I disagreed with the
guy.
But I tried not to take the "high ground" as that will only alienate
further. Regards, Richard.

It was from me I think but it wasnt published because of censorship and it
wasnt a "celebration" of the situation: in fact I cant remember exactly what
I said but I quoted Eliot's Waste Land and so on. But I tried to reason with
the guy who wants (if that's not another joke or hoax ) to attack all
Americans. My thinking on all this is more complex. I certainly dont support
that...I  may UNDERSTAND  IT or see where he's comning from, but I dont
support such a blanket hate opf anyone. But I think they meant Richard
Taylor not "Taylor Brady".
  But I might have got a "bit carried away" in that missive re "burning
towers" but as I said to the List people they cant censor what's on this
list: that's the first step to fascism. that violates the UN Charter of
Human Rights. That's being Talebanic: we need all sides to this. Keep the
lines open...Regards, Richard.

Harry. I know what the guy is saying: but the Italian fellow should know
that there are brilliant scientists, artists, poets, philosophers,
mathematicians and so on and on who are of whatever ilk: the West
civilisation is great but, given that we need to be wary of arrogance. I'm
not as confident as our Italian friend whose country produced Garibaldi

chastised for not perusing that gentleman's work: what a poet!! I agree with
Joris...a welcome change...maybe a bit  too "deep imagy" but that probably
doesnt  matter: some moving poems in REDACTIONS: obviously a great
man...probably a very gentle man I'd say...) I enjoyed Perec's book so far

I hope you can make it, even if you don't particularly feel like going to a
reading these days.  The small portion of my self that doesn't want to
climb in a hole & grieve or go out & help with the relief effort, that
small part doesn't really want to go to readings right now either.  But I
will be at Zinc Bar every Sunday & at other literary events in the weeks to
come despite & because of what's happened. In the new environment one of
the few remotely certain things we have is each other & the belief that
writing is something worth doing.  Your presence will be a comfort &
inspiration that some of the ideas & practices we had before the attack are
even more relevant this morning than they were a few weeks ago.

Thanks to everyone who checked in to say they were okay & to those who
called & wrote to offer their concern.  I hope that you & those around you
are safe & that compassion & understanding guide the events of the
immanent, looming future.

Will we see you around at Zinc & elsewhere?  Oh I hope so.

Yours,
Brendan Lorber

just need to get away for awhile.  Preference will be given to previous
residents & visitors, tho we will consider all proposals.  We have a

daily chores & work projects.  There are also endless creativities to

June Degnan -- S.F. matron, active Democrat
Angelica Pence, Chronicle Staff Writer
Friday, September 28, 2001
©2001 San Francisco Chronicle

URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/09/28/MN21406.DTL


San Francisco -- June Oppen Degnan, a staunch Democrat, respected publisher
and lover of all things literary, passed away in her Nob Hill home Sept. 14.
She was 82.

A self-proclaimed liberal Democrat, Ms. Degnan was an ardent fund-raiser and
loyal party delegate for the better part of three decades.

"Back in the days before the reformers got their hands on the campaign-
finance laws, a wealthy, charming and public-spirited San Francisco matron
was much sought after by Democratic candidates for the presidency," David S.
Broder wrote in a 1988 editorial for The Washington Post. "They knew that
simply by putting pen to checkbook, June Degnan could keep them in the race
for another two months or more."

In 1956, in her mid-30s, Ms. Degnan joined the State Democratic Central
Committee, the party's governing body for California. By 1962, she was a
national board member of the Americans for Democratic Action.

"In the 1960s and early 1970s, her support was so earnestly solicited by so
many aspiring hopefuls that she became notably tough-minded in her
judgments, finally distilling her criteria into what I came to think of as
Ms. Degnan's Law," Broder wrote.

"I figure," she once told him, "that anybody who deserves to be president of
the United States ought to be able, in a half-hour conversation, to express
one thought I had not already thought of myself."

In 1971, Ms. Degnan became both treasurer for the state Democratic Party and
national vice-chair for George McGovern's run for the White House. She
served three times as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from
1972 until 1980, twice as a member of the national finance committee.

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter tapped her as a trustee for the Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. She served in the coveted
position until 1989.

She was born in Rochester, N.Y., in 1919, and in 1939 married George Degnan,

a longtime medical director for Contra Costa County. They were divorced in
the mid-1940s.

Frequently candid, she appeared just as often in the society columns of
local newspapers -- including those of The Chronicle -- as she did in the
editorial and news pages.

Ms. Degnan was quoted in a 1990 Herb Caen column after returning from her
first flight on the Concorde. "An experience which, she (said), reminded her
of Lord Chesterfield's deathless line about sex: 'The pleasure is momentary,
the position ridiculous, and the expense damnable.' "

In 1952, she co-founded San Francisco Review, a magazine featuring the work
of poets, playwrights and novelists. Throughout the '50s and '60s, Ms.
Degnan co-published works from a slew of authors including James Hall,
William Bronk, Charles Reznikoff, Curtis Zahn and George Oppen -- her
brother.

In all, she published three books authored by her brother -- The Materials
(1962), This in Which (1965) and Of Being Numerous (1968), which was awarded
the Pulitzer Prize for poetry the year after it was first put on bookstore
shelves. By 1975, Ms. Degnan became publisher of Oceans Magazine, one of the
first wildlife and environmental magazines.

"My mother . . . was very sensitive to the history of our country both in
politics and in culture," said her daughter, Aubrey Degnan.

It was that very sensitivity, she said, that in many ways led to her
mother's death on Sept. 14 -- just three days after the terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

"She was profoundly loyal to the morals, values and spirit of this nation,"
Aubrey Degnan said. "What really led to her immediate passing were the
incidents of the Tuesday attacks. It was just too much for her spirit."

In addition to her daughter, Ms. Degnan is survived by two grandchildren,
Brett Fisher and Adam Lindgren, and four great-grandchildren: Michelle,
Richard, Alexandra, Ethan and a fifth who is yet to be born.

A memorial service will be held Oct. 28 at Temple Emanu-El, 2 Lake St., San
Francisco, at 1 p.m.

From Salon:

China puts Web handyman on trial

Yang Zili, 30, a Chinese writer and software developer, will go to trial =
http://www.bringmenews.com/China/freeyzl/rt_0926.htm this Friday in =
Beijing on charges of subversion of state power, along with three other =
pro-democracy Chinese intellectuals. The charges could bring the men =
sentences of as long as 10 years in prison.=20

As Salon reported last May in "The Price of Internet Freedom," =
http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/05/30/china_sidebar/index.html =
Yang drew state attention by acting as a kind of Web handyman to other =
Chinese intellectuals, helping them get online and publish their =
writings on the Web. He also ran a Web site, "Yang Zili's Garden of =
Ideas," that published his own pro-democracy writings. The other men who =
will stand trial with him are Xu Walin, a reporter; Zhang Honghai, a =
freelance writer; and Jin Haike, a geologist.=20

The arrest of Yang and his cohorts inspired an international human =
rights outcry http://www.bringmenews.com/China/freeyzl/

Here's Tony Torn's advert for current NYC Arthur Miller project:


I am writing to invite you to a major Off-Broadway revival of Arthur
Miller's 1972 play THE CREATION OF THE WORLD AND OTHER BUISNESS. It is
Miller's look at the Book Of Genesis...Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel,
God...and Lucifer (portrayed by yours truly- Tony Torn.)


Tickets for most of the run will be $35. Tickets for previews thru  Thursda=
y
Oct 4th are $25. But for this preview period only, if you make a reservatio=
n
using the code APPLE, you can get TWO PREVIEW TICKETS FOR THE PRICE
OF ONE! A Big Off Broadway show for less than you would pay in a tiny black
box downtown theater...only $12 per person.

This play is not sort of modern, fastfood experience that most of us have
grown used to. It is a full length three act play that gives us a witty and
ferocious tour through the source text of Western morality. This is theater
as it once was, and perhaps as it was meant to be. The director and the
designer, Oleg Kheyfets and Simon Pastukh, both hail from Russia, and have
created a production of great beauty and power that I am proud to be part
of.

The cast includes Kent Alexander as God, Paul Sparks as Adam, Valarie
Stamford as Eve, Tom Pearl as Cain, and Preston Dane as Abel. Lighting is b=
y
in house designer of The Riverside Theater, Dusty Ray. The Artistic
Collaborator is Stefanie Ansin. The Production Stage Manager is Fran
Rubenstein. The Executive Producer is Olga Kagen.

I am looking forward to seeing you uptown

TONY TORN

>CREATION has not had a major production since it opened on Broadway in
1972.
Now Russian director OLEG KHEYFETS, with the active participation of ARTHUR
MILLER, reinvestigates this timeless exploration of good and evil.  Adam &
Eve, God and Lucifer, Cain and Abel share the stage in MILLER's unsettling
story about the first family, the first rape, and the first murder.

THE CREATION OF THE WORLD AND OTHER BUSINESS runs from September 27 to
November 4 at The Theatre of The Riverside Church, 490 Riverside Drive
(entrance at 91 Claremont Avenue between West 120th and West 121st St.).
$35 General Admission/ $25 Students & Seniors.  For tickets call
212.870.6784.

**MENTION THE CODE WORD "APPLE" FOR $12 TICKETS TO SEPTEMBER 27-OCTOBER 5
PERFORMANCES**>  1. m&r...Iran.

Santa Fe, NM -- The Lannan Foundation announced today that Robert Creeley=
 will be honored with a Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award. The award=
 recognizes writers who have made significant contributions to=
 English-language literature. Over 12 years, Lannan Foundation has awarded=
 105 writers more than $5.7 million.=20

Robert Creeley, poet, novelist, short story writer, essayist, editor, and=
 teacher, was born in Arlington, Massachusetts in 1926. He entered Harvard=
 University in 1943, leaving after one year to drive an ambulance in India=
 and Burma during World War II. During the 1950s, after dropping out of=
 Harvard, he taught at Black Mountain College in North Carolina and was an=
 editor of its innovative literary journal, the Black Mountain Review. Mr.=
 Creeley was one of the founders of the Black Mountain school of poetry,=
 which emphasized natural speech rhythms and lines determined by pauses for=
 breathing=96a poetry designed to transmit the poet=92s emotional and=
 intellectual energy directly and spontaneously. After receiving his MA
from=
 the University of New Mexico, Mr. Creeley taught at the University of=
 British Columbia, San Francisco State College, and the State University of=
 New York at Buffalo, where he is presently Samuel P. Capen Professor of=
 Poetry and Letters.=20

        Um...in regards to the below, my very best interpretation of Selim's
post was that it was an extremely creepy, broad and tasteless joke, and one
that I, and I would think most people here in NYC who just saw close to
7,000 people die useless, horrible deaths before their eyes, found pretty
offensive. I mean, he certainly has the right to make "jokes"--you know,
whatever tickles your funny bone--that and setting cats on fire--but to have
obtuse theorizing piled on top of the original "joke" kind of turns my gut.
Personally, the word "windbag" brings a smile to my lips more readily than a
threat to kill more human beings, no matter who's making the joke.

how long before any criticism of America can
simply be answered with the cry

"WHAT ABOUT THE VICTIMS! YOU DISHONOUR THE
VICTIMS!"

and the victims - being dead - cannot be asked
what they might think on the subject

it's an easy one to play - any criticism, any
suggestion contrary to the prevailing attitude
can simply be answered by calling the person
insensitive to the victims - thus effectively
shutting down any dialogue

America *is* an arrrogant country - this is no
less true now than it was before - it's policies
demonstrate that - it's unwavering support for an
indefinable and unwinnable war against an
ideology - has proven that - that Canada was left
out of the Presidential speech, and later blamed
for having lax borders prove this - because the
terrorists were all let in on AMERICAN SAY SO! -
then again, someone has to take the blame - and
even South Park knows that "Blame Canada" is
always a good policy - after all - how many
Americans can even find it on a map?

it was a humbling experience - to realise just
how fragile, how easy it was to commit such an
attack on American soil *should* be humbling -
this does not mean that i think that they should
"take it lying down" and not respond - only
that the shutting down of dissenting opinions -
and from a Backstreet Boy no less! - ought not be
condoned

"What has our government done to deserve this
action that we don't know about?"

it's an excellent question - even if they did not
"deserve" it (and i think this is the case) -
clearly someone did - enough to mount a
large-scale suicide action against America -

of course i mourn the deaths of the nearly 7000
people who died - and the millions who died in
the last century in far worse atrocities and in
far worse ways - this does not mean that i should
allow my anger and grief to be used by
politicians to further their own agendas

and rest assured - the victims of this tragedy
have become pawns in political struggle - they
will be raised anytime anyone dare question the
eroding civil liberties, the increased military
spending and the spindoctoring bs that will come
to us through our televisions -

already we have seen art programs censored in
Canada because of this - how long until they set
their sights on writers and poets?

Alvin Lu w/ experimental filmmakers Janie Geiser and Lewis Klahr!

at Dawsons Book Shop, Sunday Sept 30 @ 4pm!

After this month's dramatic events, the French writer Marc Cholodenko opted
out of his planned US tour. In his place however, double the dream and
triple the dreamer, three active oneirists from edge of city sleep! Alvin Lu
comes to town with his phastasmatic hybrid of a novel, The Hell Screens,
combining Chinese ghost tales with a pomo pot-boiler that veers into heady
prose poetry at every turn. Tailing him are LA's most audaciously animated
animator duo, Janie Geiser and Lewis Klahr, with their latest experimental
collage animation works, "The Aperature of Ghostings" (Janie) and a tone
poem trilogy by Lewis to be accompanied by his classic Engram Sepals. In
fact, Lewis' films & titles are so great, I've written several poems myself
after them! A spirited cabal, not to be missed!

This event was conceived and brought to term by the ever resourceful Walter
Lew. Thanks Walter!

Alvin Lu is a novelist, screenwriter and film critic, as well as the editor
and mega manga expert of PULP, a magazine dedicated to innovative serialized
comic novels. He graduated from Brown's MFA fiction program, and has since
worked for the SFGuardian and Viz as an arts editor and film reviewer. His
first novel, THE HELL SCREENS, is a cinematic plunge into urban vertigo and
transhistorical a-maze-ment. the NYTimes said of it: "This devilish puzzle
of a novel may frustrate the casual reader, but it will appeal to anyone who
loves the cat-and-mouse games of Nabokov, the playful elegance of Borges or
the rarefied dreamscapes of Calvino." A further review of HELL SCREENS and
an interview with Alvin can be found below:

Janie Geiser is a filmmaker and experimental puppet theater artist who has
been working in the field for over 18 years. She is director of the Cotsen
Center for Puppetry and the Arts at CalArts. Geiser's work has been
performed and screened internationally in venues such as the International
Festival of Puppet Theater, the Walker Art Center, the Phenomena Festival
(Jerusalem), Dance Theater Workshop, The New York Film Festival, the
Rotterdam International Film Festival and on PBS. A review of some of
Janie's recent films can be found at:
http://www.fredcamper.com/Film/Geiser.html

Lewis Klahr has created a signature style that uses shadows, stillness, and
staccato movements as an expressive language in experimental film and
collage. J. Hoberman says of Lewis: "The reigning proponent of cut and paste
animation, Klahr uses old magazines and comic strips to evoke a lost pop
culture paradise--part NY Worlds Fair, part noir". One-person shows of his
work have appeared across the country including at the Museum of Modern Art
(New York), the Whitney Museum (New York), the Carnegie Museum (Pittsburgh),
and the Museum of Fine Art (Boston). His grants include fellowships from the
Guggenheim and Jerome Foundations and New York State Council for the Arts
(1995/93/89/86). A recent interview with Lewis can be found at:

So happy birthday!

And yesterday was Aaron Belz's thirtieth.  Happy birthday, me!

Which means I was born one day before your fortieth, a party you surely
remember.  And when you were my age, ten years before that, John F. Kennedy
was Time Magazine's "Man of the Year."  And when I am your age it will be
September, 2041.  And yet I don't know what will happen this afternoon and
don't clearly remember what I was doing at this moment one month ago.  My
children, two and three years old, are just beginning to get a sense of how
humans mark time.  IT is a strange, strange game.

I keep hearing it referred to as 'the accident' to which I feel compelled to
answer, no it was on purpose.  That's the aspect which seems uncontainable
by language.  As in to contain, or gain control over.

The Poetry Project will offer three weekly writing workshops in Fall 2001.
Beginning in mid-October, the workshops will run through mid-January.
Workshops at the Poetry Project provide access to innovative techniques and
practices of writing not usually available in more mainstream venues.

..AND NOT NEITHER, EITHER: A POEM-STORY WORKSHOP taught by SHARON MESMER
(TUESDAY EVENINGS 7-9 P.M.; 10 SESSIONS; BEGINS OCTOBER 16)
A poem-story begins in poetry, with heightened language, imagery, and
rhythm, but moves quickly into story via traditional narrative elements of
set-up, conflict, resolution, and perspective (for example, Octavio Paz's
"My Life with the Wave"). To generate these "poem-stories," we will read
model texts and do in-class writing experiments (cut-ups, "Third Mind"
experiments, word collages, assemblages of juxtaposed journal notes -
methods normally associated with the writing of poetry -) to generate ideas,
scenes, characters, conflicts, even dialogue, then work with the raw
material to discover the potential story and create and sustain the
narrative. Our goal? To engage the dynamics of poetry and story with equal
intensity.

SHARON MESMER is the author of Half Angel, Half Lunch (poems, Hard Press,
1998), and The Empty Quarter (stories, Hanging Loose Press, 2000). She
teaches literature and fiction-writing at the New School University. Her
work has appeared in the anthologies Heights of the Marvelous, Poems for the
Nation (edited by Allen Ginsberg), and The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry.



CROWNING SONNETS: POETRY WORKSHOP taught by PATRICIA SPEARS JONES (FRIDAY
EVENINGS 7-9 P.M.; 10 SESSIONS; BEGINS OCTOBER 19)
During this workshop, we will look at traditional and nontraditional sonnets
from Sharespeare to Millay to Molly Peacock and others and explore thir
connection to the work that paricipants are doing. We will also look at
contemporary odes and other lyric forms to help spark new ideas and new
poems from participants. This is a workshop for poets who want to informally
explore the dyanmics of the sonnet and create new ones as well as work on
poems that reflect their personal style. The goal of the workshop will be
the creation of a crown of sonnets (7) on a single theme by each of the
participants.
Those interested in taking the Crowning Sonnets workshop are asked to submit
(1) a selection of 10 poems and (2) a brief history of other classes,
workshops or poetic studies to the Poetry Project by OCTOBER 5TH.

PATRICIA SPEARS JONES is a poet, playwright and author of the collection,
The Weather That Kills (Coffee House Press, 1995) and the play Mother,
produced by Mabou Mines in 1994. Her poems have been anthologized over the
past two decades most recently in Best American Poetry 2000 (Scribners),
Blood and Tears: Poems for Matthew Shepard and Real Things: An Anthology of
Popular Cutlture in America.



POETRY WORKSHOP taught by ANSELM BERRIGAN (Saturday afternoons 12-2 p.m.; 10
sessions; begins October 20) Reading, Writing, Discussion. poem as site of
arrangement. metaphysics of using cut language and stealing (from yourself,
among others). reporting and rewriting. process, and suspicion thereof. how

ANSELM BERRIGAN is the author of Integrity & Dramatic Life, and Zero Star
Hotel, forthcoming this fall from Edge books. He has taught poetry classes
at Naropa University and Rutgers University.

individual membership in the Poetry Project for one year. Payment must be
received in advance.

Thanks, Ron, I've been thinking about this, too, every time I have to refer
to those events.

I've sometimes referred to "the terrorist attacks," or "the horror of last
Tuesday" (when it *was* last Tuesday), or "the horrors," but yes, more
recently and most often, either "events of September 11" or just "September
11." I don't feel comfortable echoing the newsmen and referring to the
"Attack on America," which seems like it must be capitalized as it's
already taken (and was, almost instantly) as some kind of title. One thing
so odd is how suddenly it was here, and how suddenly gone, so that we had
so little time, and in a way no time in our minds, to be in the midst of
it. Yet in very important ways we are still in the midst of it and will be
for an unpredictably long time.

Mime-version: 1.0

Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

The Poetry Project will offer three weekly writing workshops in Fall 2001.
Beginning in mid-October, the workshops will run through mid-January.
Workshops at the Poetry Project provide access to innovative techniques and
practices of writing not usually available in more mainstream venues.

...AND NOT NEITHER, EITHER: A POEM-STORY WORKSHOP taught by SHARON MESMER
(TUESDAY EVENINGS 7-9 P.M.; 10 SESSIONS; BEGINS OCTOBER 16)
A poem-story begins in poetry, with heightened language, imagery, and
rhythm, but moves quickly into story via traditional narrative elements of
set-up, conflict, resolution, and perspective (for example, Octavio Paz's
"My Life with the Wave"). To generate these "poem-stories," we will read
model texts and do in-class writing experiments (cut-ups, "Third Mind"
experiments, word collages, assemblages of juxtaposed journal notes -
methods normally associated with the writing of poetry -) to generate ideas,
scenes, characters, conflicts, even dialogue, then work with the raw
material to discover the potential story and create and sustain the
narrative. Our goal? To engage the dynamics of poetry and story with equal
intensity.

SHARON MESMER is the author of Half Angel, Half Lunch (poems, Hard Press,
1998), and The Empty Quarter (stories, Hanging Loose Press, 2000). She
teaches literature and fiction-writing at the New School University. Her
work has appeared in the anthologies Heights of the Marvelous, Poems for the
Nation (edited by Allen Ginsberg), and The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry.



CROWNING SONNETS: POETRY WORKSHOP taught by PATRICIA SPEARS JONES (FRIDAY
EVENINGS 7-9 P.M.; 10 SESSIONS; BEGINS OCTOBER 19)
During this workshop, we will look at traditional and nontraditional sonnets
from Sharespeare to Millay to Molly Peacock and others and explore thir
connection to the work that paricipants are doing. We will also look at
contemporary odes and other lyric forms to help spark new ideas and new
poems from participants. This is a workshop for poets who want to informally
explore the dyanmics of the sonnet and create new ones as well as work on
poems that reflect their personal style. The goal of the workshop will be
the creation of a crown of sonnets (7) on a single theme by each of the
participants.
Those interested in taking the Crowning Sonnets workshop are asked to submit
(1) a selection of 10 poems and (2) a brief history of other classes,
workshops or poetic studies to the Poetry Project by OCTOBER 5TH.

PATRICIA SPEARS JONES is a poet, playwright and author of the collection,
The Weather That Kills (Coffee House Press, 1995) and the play Mother,
produced by Mabou Mines in 1994. Her poems have been anthologized over the
past two decades most recently in Best American Poetry 2000 (Scribners),
Blood and Tears: Poems for Matthew Shepard and Real Things: An Anthology of
Popular Cutlture in America.



POETRY WORKSHOP taught by ANSELM BERRIGAN (Saturday afternoons 12-2 p.m.; 10
sessions; begins October 20) Reading, Writing, Discussion. poem as site of
arrangement. metaphysics of using cut language and stealing (from yourself,
among others). reporting and rewriting. process, and suspicion thereof. how
many different places are there to write from?  timing, unconscious
allegory, eco-systems, comedy, documentation, dreams, elegies, mind matter,
rhythm.

ANSELM BERRIGAN is the author of Integrity & Dramatic Life, and Zero Star
Hotel, forthcoming this fall from Edge books. He has taught poetry classes
at Naropa University and Rutgers University.



THE WORKSHOP FEE IS $250, which includes tuition for classes and an
individual membership in the Poetry Project for one year. Payment must be
received in advance.

Subject:      Israel
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

The only thing everybody seems to agree on is that, whatever cause it has
been in leading to the attacks of September 11, the United States' policy
in relation to Israel needs to be changed.  It is hard, however, to
understand what, in justice, this means.

The Clinton policy was for Israel to offer to the Palestinians just the
Palestinian state alongside Israel that most Poetics listserv writers say
they favor, and it is what Barak did offer at Camp David--95% and more of
the West Bank and Gaza, including East Jerusalem--and what Arafat rejected
by launching his second intifada, without so much as a negotiation for a
better deal.  We need to be reminded that a Palestinian state alongside of
Israel was what all the Arab nations rejected in '48, launching a war to
prevent it; it is what both Jordan and Egypt rejected from '48 to '67, when
they controlled all of the West Bank and Gaza, where they preferred keeping
the Palestinians in miserable refugee camps to a genuine Palestinian
homeland, resulting in another war when Israel rejected Nasser's call to
"push them to the sea"; and it is what Arafat continues to reject, both
overtly and by refusing to reign in the absolutely rejectionist Hizbollah
and Hamas, who, also overtly, say they want no Jews living anywhere from
the Jordan to the Mediterranean.

It's convenient to blame Israel for the state of Arab and Palestinian
suffering in the Middle East and to romanticize Arafat as a freedom
fighter.  But even in relation to their own people, Arafat and the
Palestinian Authority have behaved like a bunch of thugs an crooks,
squirreling away into Swiss bank accounts the millions upon millions of
dollars that have poured into them from the United States, as a result of
the Oslo accords, and from the Arab oil nations, instead of using them to
create a Palestinian economy, and preventing almost any freedom of dissent
with repression and murder.

Let the PA's  praise as martyrs of suicide blowing up of restaurants and
discotechs stop; let the PA's state media stop demonizing Israelis as they
do in the most conventional anti-Jewish fashion (pictures of Jews with long
noses and all); let Arafat start telling his people, in Arabic, that they
must accept an independent Israel as a now and forever fact, whether they
like it or not; let him respond to the Barak proposal, and you will see a
new election in Israel that Labor can again win and a peace and quiet
between the Jordan and the Mediterranean that, I would hope, the United
States would protect from the other rejectionist Arab leaders who will then
have much to fear from their own peoples who might just demand of them some
such decent life as they see in the example that is thereby set.

there clearly is, and there clearly will continue to be, a presence
on this list, and all lists, that takes full advantage of the ease
with which one can create email accounts helter-skelter...

yes, and language and imagesare and will continue to be crucial: witness the
flag discussion here and note the current mindless, alternativeless phrasing
of current polls.  My perception from clients, friends and family, and those
I'm listening to is that we are all looking for the words that describe how
we are feeling.

1. Do you imply by that that my calling someone a "winbag" represents a
greater "rhetorical violence" than Selim Abdul Sadiq's post? I wonder how
much of you judgement has to do with content rather than etiquette?

2. I am not aware of any angry reaction to Sadiq's post mentioning the Arabic
origin of his name. You yourself are introducing this theme here, in my view,
completely arbitrarily, not to say with "rhetorical violence." The issue of
"racial profiling" in this context is red herring, a spin to divert from the
obsenity of the post.

This is the text of a talk given by Fritjof Capra the earlier this week at
the Black Oaks bookstore in North Beach, San Francisco.  There were 3
scientists in attendance, there to talk about their work; Fritjof took his
time to deliver this piece he prepared on understanding 9/11 events and
current worldwide situation from a systemic perspective.

I asked him for a copy to share with our own ongoing 911 listserv, thought
nettime would like it as well.

Trying to Understand

A Systemic Analysis of International Terrorism

by Fritjof Capra

Fritjof Capra (www.fritjofcapra.net), physicist, systems theorist, and
best-selling author, is a founding director of the Center for Ecoliteracy
(www.ecoliteracy.org), which is dedicated to education for sustainable
living.

The horrific terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11
mark the end of an era =8B the end of over 200 years of invulnerability on =
our
continent. We had heard fundamentalist rhetoric about "striking at the hear=
t
of America" for years, but we took it as empty threats. We did not recogniz=
e
the emergence of a new weapon on the international stage against which we
were defenseless =8B the despair-driven, desperate suicide bomber.(1)

This new form of international terrorism exposes the dangerous fallacy of a
national shield against ballistic missiles. Missile defense is of no use
whatsoever when terrorists can turn commercial planes into missiles and
their fuel tanks into bombs with the help of simple box cutters.

A SYSTEMIC PERSPECTIVE

There is no simple defense against international terrorism, because we live
in a complex, globally interconnected world in which linear chains of cause
and effect do not exist. To understand this world, we need to think
systemically =8B in terms of relationships, connections, and context.

Understanding international terrorism from a systemic perspective means
understanding that its very nature derives from a series of political,
economic, and technological problems that are all interconnected. This
terrorism is not "mindless," and it is not directed against our "freedom an=
d
democracy," as our government wants us to believe.

Terrorism is always a weapon of the politically disempowered and desperate
who feel that they are unable to voice their grievances through conventiona=
l
political processes. In order to combat them effectively, we need to clearl=
y
understand the terrorists=B9 frustration.(2)

This does not mean that we should shrink from capturing the terrorists and
bringing them to justice. Their crimes are abhorrent beyond words. But we
must learn to distinguish between their criminal methods and fundamentalist
ideologies on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the often legitimate
grievances that drive them into committing such desperate and horrific acts=
=2E
We cannot fight terrorism effectively without understanding its roots.

We shall see in particular that much of Islamic fundamentalism is related t=
o
the role of the United States in the Middle East and that extremist Islamic
movements often arise in direct response to American policies. Of course,
the United States is not the only power to blame. There is the insidious
legacy of European colonialism; yet American policies since World War II
have contributed significantly to the recent rise of fundamentalist Islamic
terrorism.(3)

INAPPROPRIATENESS OF MILITARY STRIKES

Understandably, the first reaction to the horrendous attacks on the United
States is the desire to "strike back." But responding to terrorism with
violence, rather than dealing with the context from which it emerged, will
continue to create more violence. We must recognize that military actions
will not succeed in eliminating the rise of militant Islamic movements. On
the contrary, they will result in the deaths of innocent Muslim civilians
that will further fuel anti-American hatred.

Retaliatory strikes against suspected terrorist targets trigger further
retaliation from terrorists and  thus escalate the cycle of violence, as
Israel=B9s experience has shown. Surgical strikes make sense only when ther=
e
are military targets with heavy equipment, which the terrorist networks do
not have. Moreover, such strikes are often based on faulty intelligence,
which further exacerbates their negative effects.(4)

Since this terrorism is international, the response has to be international
as well. The goals of the coalitions and cooperation within the
international community cannot be limited to identifying and capturing the
terrorists, as they currently are, but must be extended to addressing the
underlying systemic problems. This will be the only way to marginalize the
terrorists and strengthen our security in the long run.

AMERICA'S IMAGE IN THE WORLD

The terrorism we are concerned with is directed against the United States,
and hence the attempt to understand its roots has to begin with the
understanding of America=B9s image in the world. This image is multi-facete=
d.
It includes many positive aspects of our society =8B such as individual
liberty, cultural diversity, and economic opportunity =8B as well as the gr=
eat
enthusiasm for American technology, fashion, sports, and entertainment,
especially among the world=B9s youth.

On the other hand, the United States is seen by many as the driving force o=
f
a global capitalism that is supported by military force and is often
socially unjust and environmentally destructive. Indeed, the buildings
attacked by the terrorists on September 11 were proud symbols of American
economic power and military might.

U.S. ROLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST

To understand the political context of the  recent terrorist attacks, we
need to look specifically at the U.S. role in the Middle East. The common
view in this country is that we have assumed the role of peacemakers in the
region. In other parts of the world, and especially in the Muslim world, th=
e
view is quite different. There is widespread anti-American sentiment, based
on a number of concerns.(5) They include resentment against

o our uncritical support for the Israeli occupation of Arab land, the
dispossession of Palestinians and for state-sponsored assassinations;

o our support of undemocratic and repressive Arab governments, in particula=
r
that of Saudi Arabia;

o ten years of sanctions and military attacks against Iraq, which have
resulted in the deaths of half a million children;

o our massive military presence in the region (seen by Muslim
fundamentalists, especially in Saudi Arabia, as the presence of infidels in
the holy land of Islam), as well as our role as the largest supplier of arm=
s
in the Middle East.

These grievances have contributed to the rise of several radical Islamic
movements, including Hamas and al Qaeda, the terrorist network of Osama bin
Laden.

Now, why do we support repressive regimes, ignore UN resolutions, and
promote violence in the Middle East? The answer, in one word, is "oil." In
the view of our government, the access to Persian Gulf oil is essential to
the security of the United States. In the Gulf region, like in many other
areas in the world, our policies are primarily resource-oriented, designed
to support our wasteful economy.

Thus, the U.S. role in the Middle East and its contribution to the rise of
radical Islamic movements are inextricably linked to our misguided energy
policies.

To assure American access to natural resources around the world, the U.S.
government continually tries to "stabilize" various regions and, in doing
so, has often supported undemocratic and repressive regimes. This has
included support to governments that have engaged in widespread terrorism
against their own populations.(6) Ironically, the U.S. has at times
supported hard-line Islamic movements. Indeed, some of the most notorious
Islamic terrorists today, including many followers of Osama bin Laden, were
originally trained by the CIA.(7)

Our support of repressive governments has helped to encourage underground,
often violent, opposition, and the fact that we ourselves have sponsored
terrorist attacks undercuts our credibility in the fight against terrorism.

RELATIONSHIP WITH SAUDI ARABIA

To understand the motivation of Osama bin Laden and other Islamic
extremists, we need to pay special attention to the U.S. relationship with
Saudi Arabia. This relationship is based on an extraordinary bargain,
concluded in 1945 between President Roosevelt and King Ibn Saud, according
to which Saudi Arabia grants the U.S. unlimited and perpetual access to its
oil fields (which contain 25% of the world=B9s known oil reserves!) in
exchange for protection of the Saudi royal family against its enemies, both
external and internal. This bargain has shaped American foreign and militar=
y
policy for almost half a century, during which we have protected a
totalitarian regime in Saudi Arabia that blatantly disregards basic human
rights and tramples democracy.(8)

The main purpose of the Gulf war in 1991, originally code-named "Desert
Shield," was not to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, but to protect Saudi Arabia
from a possible attack and to guarantee U.S. access to the Saudi oil fields=
=2E
Since then, the U.S. has maintained and steadily expanded its military
presence in the Gulf. In addition we also defend the Saudi regime against
its internal enemies. The Saudi Arabian National Guard, which protects the
royal family, is almost entirely armed, trained, and managed by the United
States.(9)

The goal of Osama bin Laden=B9s terrorist network is to drive the U.S. out =
of
the Gulf region and to replace the corrupt Saudi regime by what they
consider an "authentic" Islamic state. Such a state would be modeled after
that of the fundamentalist Taliban in Afghanistan, which  is many times mor=
e
repressive than the current Saudi regime. Nevertheless, as long as we
continue to support the totalitarian system in Saudi Arabia, our support
will fuel anti-American hatred.

CAUSES OF TERRORIST STRIKES

To summarize, at the core of the multiple causes of the recent terrorist
attacks against the United States lies the U.S. military presence in the
Persian Gulf and our support of the repressive Saudi regime. This presence,
in turn, is a consequence of our dependence on Saudi oil, due to many years
of misguided energy policies.

Bin Laden=B9s terrorist network has declared an anti-American jihad, a
religious war, and finds it easy to recruit volunteers among Muslims who
feel frustrated and helpless about other aspects of the U.S. role in the
Middle East. These aspects include, in particular, the U.S. support of the
Israeli occupation of Arab land and the dispossession of Palestinians;
Muslim casualties of U.S.-supported military actions and assassinations, an=
d
especially the death of large numbers of civilians in Iraq.

At a deeper level, the extremists often receive sympathy from Islamic
fundamentalists who are struggling to preserve their cultural identity in
the face of U.S.-led economic globalization.

A MULTI-FACETED ANTI-TERRORIST STRATEGY

The systemic understanding of the background of extremist Islamic terrorism
calls for a multi-faceted anti-terrorist strategy. The immediate goal,
obviously, is to identify and capture the perpetrators and supporters of th=
e
terrorist attacks against the United States, and to bring them to justice
before an international court. Since the extension and scope of this
terrorism is international, it requires sustained international police work=
,
based on extensive and widespread cooperation among the international
community.

This means, in turn, that the United States will have to reverse its recent
isolationist stance and become a responsible member of the international
community. Instead of weakening or walking away from a series of
international treaties and conventions =8B including the Kyoto protocol on
global warming, the Biological Weapons Convention, the World Criminal Court=
,
and the UN Conference on Racism =8B the Bush Administration needs to realiz=
e
that cooperation with the United Nations and other multilateral agencies
will be vital to increase our own strength and security.(10)

In this international collaboration, it will be especially important to
enlist the help of Islamic states in portraying the extremists as enemies o=
f
Islam, because no true Muslim would take thousands of innocent lives in suc=
h
reprehensible acts.(11) At the same time, our leaders need to help
counteract American religious stereotypes. We need to make it clear that th=
e
vast majority of the world=B9s Muslims opposes terrorism and religious
intolerance.(12)

POLICY SHIFTS

In the long run, the United States will be able to reduce the terrorist
threats only if it adopts a series of policy shifts to deal with the
legitimate grievances that often underlie terrorist acts. Systemic thinking
means shifting our focus from attempting to crush terrorist movements to
pursuing policies that discourage their emergence.

The following two policy shifts would go a long way toward increasing our
national security.

1. A reassessment of U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf, including pressure on
the Saudi regime to move toward democratization and the provision of basic
human rights.

2. Promoting a peace agreement that includes the end of Israeli occupation
of Palestinian territories. This would bring the United States in line with
international law, UN Security Council resolutions, and with the views of
virtually the entire international community. In the words of the Israeli
novelist and peace activist Amos Oz,

"With or without Islamic fundamentalism, with or without Arab terrorism,
there is no justification whatsoever for the lasting occupation and
suppression of the Palestinian people by Israel. We have no right to deny
Palestinians their natural right to self-determination."(13)

CHANGE OF ENERGY POLICY

In order to carry out these shifts of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle
East, it will be crucial to sever our dependence on Saudi oil. A shift of
energy policy from the current heavy emphasis on fossil fuels to renewable
energy sources and conservation is not only imperative for moving toward
ecological sustainability, but must also be seen as vital to our national
security.

Such a shift is absolutely feasible with technologies that are available
today.(14) The recent development of efficient hydrogen fuel cells promises
to inaugurate a new era in energy production =8B the "hydrogen economy."

A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that combines hydrogen with oxygen
to produce electricity and water =8B and nothing else! This makes hydrogen =
the
ultimate clean fuel. At present, several companies around the world are
racing to be the first to produce fuel cell systems to supply electricity
for our homes and commercial buildings.     At the same time, car companies
are developing hydrogen-powered hybrid-electric cars that will revolutioniz=
e
the automobile industry. The gradual replacement of the U.S. car fleet with
these "hypercars" would eventually save all the oil OPEC now sells and, in
addition, would reduce America=B9s CO2  emissions by about two thirds!

Moreover, if a hydrogen tanker struck a reef in Prince William Sound,
Alaska, this would have no adverse environmental effects, nor could a
hydrogen-fueled airplane be used as a bomb. In both cases, the hydrogen
would escape rapidly into the air on impact.

The hydrogen economy will eventually be realized, because it features
superior technologies =8B more economical, safer, and ecologically
sustainable. However, this development could be accelerated dramatically
with massive investments by the federal government. Such investments would
not only bring tremendous environmental and health benefits, but would also
be an effective long-term measure against international terrorism.

Week 1: Ghosts and Echoes

From: Robin Morgan

Dear Friends,

Your response to the email I sent on Day 2 of this calamity has been
overwhelming. In addition to friends and colleagues, absolute strangers- in
Serbia, Korea, Fiji, Zambia, all across North America--have replied, as
have women's networks in places ranging from Senegal and Japan to Chile,
Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, even Iran. You've offered moving emotional support
and asked for continued updates. I can't send regular reports/alerts as I
did during the elections last November or the cabinet confirmation battles
last year. But here's another try. Share this letter as you wish.

I'll focus on New York--my firsthand experience--but this doesn't mean any
less anguish for the victims of the Washington or Pennsylvania calamities.

Today was Day 8. Incredibly, a week has passed. Abnormal normalcy has
settled in. Our usually contentious mayor (previously bad news for New
Yorkers of color and for artists) has risen to this moment with efficiency,
compassion, real leadership. The city is alive and dynamic. Below 14th
Street, traffic is flowing again, mail is being delivered, newspapers are
back. But very early this morning I walked east, then south almost to the
tip of Manhattan Island.

The 16-acre site itself is closed off, of course, as is a perimeter
surrounding it controlled by the National Guard, used as a command post and
staging area for rescue workers. Still, one is able to approach nearer to
the area than was possible last weekend, since the law-court district and
parts of the financial district are now open and (shakily) working. The
closer one gets the more one sees--and smells- what no TV report, and very
few print reports, have communicated. I find myself giving way to tears
again and again, even as I write this.

If the first sights of last Tuesday seemed bizarrely like a George Lucas
special-effects movie, now the directorial eye has changed: it's the grim
lens of Agnes Varda, juxtaposed with images so surreal they could have been
framed by Bunuel or Kurosawa.

This was a bright, cloudless, early autumnal day. But as one draws near the
site, the area looms out of a dense haze: one enters an atmosphere of dust,
concrete powder, and plumes of smoke from fires still raging deep beneath
the rubble (an estimated 2 million cubic yards of debris). Along lower 2nd
Avenue, 10 refrigerator tractor-trailer trucks are parked, waiting; if you
stand there a while, an NYC Medical Examiner van arrives -with a sagging
body bag. Thick white ash, shards of broken glass, pebbles, and chunks of
concrete cover street after street of parked cars for blocks outside the
perimeter.

Handprints on car windows and doors- handprints sliding downward--have been
left like frantic graffiti. Sometimes there are messages finger-written in
the ash: "U R Alive." You can look into closed shops, many with cracked or
broken windows, and peer into another dimension: a wall-clock stopped at
9:10, restaurant tables meticulously set but now covered with two inches of
ash, grocery shelves stacked with cans and produce bins piled high with
apples and melons--all now powdered chalk-white. A moonscape of plenty.

People walk unsteadily along these streets, wearing nosemasks against the
still particle-full air, the stench of burning wire and plastic, erupted
sewage; the smell of death, of decomposing flesh.

Probably your TV coverage shows the chain-link fences aflutter with yellow
ribbons, the makeshift shrines of candles, flowers, scribbled notes of
mourning or of praise for the rescue workers that have sprung up
everywhere--especially in front of firehouses, police stations, hospitals.

What TV doesn't show you is that near Ground Zero the streets for blocks
around are still, a week later, adrift in bits of paper--singed, torn,
sodden pages: stock reports, trading print-outs, shreds of appointment
calendars, half of a "To-Do" list. What TV doesn't show you are scores of
tiny charred corpses now swept into the gutters. Sparrows. Finches. They
fly higher than pigeons, so they would have exploded outward, caught midair
in a rush of flame, wings on fire as they fell. Who could have imagined it:
the birds were burning.

>From a distance, you can see the lattices of one of the Towers, its
skeletal bones the sole remains, eerily beautiful in asymmetry, as if a new
work of abstract art had been erected in a public space. Elsewhere, you see
the transformation of institutions: The New School and New York University
are missing persons' centers. A movie house is now a rest shelter, a Burger
King a first-aid center, a Brooks Brothers clothing store a body parts
morgue, a record shop a haven for lost animals. Libraries are counseling
centers. Ice rinks are morgues. A bank is now a supply depot: in the first
four days, it distributed 11,000 respirators and 25,000 pairs of protective
gloves and suits. Nearby, a mobile medical unit housed in a Macdonald's has
administered 70,000 tetanus shots. The brain tries to process the numbers:
"only" 50,000 tons of debris had been cleared by yesterday, out of 1.2
million tons. The medical examiner's office has readied up to 20,000 DNA
tests for unidentifiable cadaver parts. At all times, night and day, a
minimum of 1000 people live and work on the site.

Such numbers daze the mind. It's the details--fragile, individual--that
melt numbness into grief. An anklet with "Joyleen" engraved on it--found on
an ankle. Just that: an ankle. A pair of hands--one brown, one
white--clasped together. Just that. No wrists. A burly welder who drove
from Ohio to help, saying softly, "We're working in a cemetery. I'm
standing in--not on, in--a graveyard." Each lamppost, storefront,
scaffolding, mailbox, is plastered with homemade photocopied posters, a
racial/ethnic rainbow of faces and names: death the great leveler, not only
of the financial CEOs- their images usually formal, white, male, older,
with suit-and-tie--but the mailroom workers, receptionists, waiters. You
pass enough of the MISSING posters and the faces, names, descriptions
become familiar. The Albanian window-cleaner guy with the bushy eyebrows.
The teenage Mexican dishwasher who had an American flag tattoo. The
janitor's assistant who'd emigrated from Ethiopia. The Italian-American
grandfather who was a doughnut-cart tender. The 23-year-old Chinese
American junior pastry chef at the Windows on the World restaurant who'd
gone in early that day so she could prep a business breakfast for 500. The
firefighter who'd posed jauntily wearing his green shamrock necktie. The
dapper African-American midlevel manager with a small gold ring in his ear
who handled "minority affairs" for one of the companies. The middle-aged
secretary laughing up at the camera from her wheelchair. The maintenance
worker with a Polish name, holding his newborn baby. Most of the faces are
smiling; most of the shots are family photos; many are recent wedding
pictures. . . .

I have little national patriotism, but I do have a passion for New York,
partly for our gritty, secular energy of endurance, and because the world
does come here: 80 countries had offices in the Twin Towers; 62 countries
lost citizens in the catastrophe; an estimated 300 of our British cousins
died, either in the planes or the buildings. My personal comfort is found
not in ceremonies or prayer services but in watching the plain, truly
heroic (a word usually misused) work of ordinary New Yorkers we take for
granted every day, who have risen to this moment unpretentiously, too busy
even to notice they're expressing the splendor of the human spirit:
firefighters, medical aides, nurses, ER doctors, police officers,
sanitation workers, construction-workers, ambulance drivers, structural
engineers, crane operators, rescue worker tunnel rats. . . .

Meanwhile, across the US, the rhetoric of retaliation is in full-throated
roar. Flag sales are up. Gun sales are up. Some radio stations have banned
playing John Lennon's song, "Imagine." Despite appeals from all officials
(even Bush), mosques are being attacked, firebombed; Arab Americans are
hiding their children indoors; two murders in Arizona have already been
categorized as hate crimes--one victim a Lebanese-American man and one a
Sikh man who died merely for wearing a turban. (Need I say that there were
not nationwide attacks against white Christian males after Timothy McVeigh
was apprehended for the Oklahoma City bombing?)

Last Thursday, right-wing televangelists Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson
(our home-grown American Taliban leaders) appeared on Robertson's TV show
"The 700 Club," where Falwell blamed "the pagans, and the abortionists, and
the feminists and the gays and lesbians . . . the American Civil Liberties
Union, People for the American Way" and groups "who have tried to
secularize America" for what occurred in New York. Robertson replied, "I
totally concur." After even the Bush White House called the remarks
"inappropriate," Falwell apologized (though he did not take back his
sentiments); Robertson hasn't even apologized. (The program is carried by
the Fox Family Channel, recently purchased by the Walt Disney Company--in
case you'd like to register a protest.)

The sirens have lessened. But the drums have started. Funeral drums. War
drums. A State of Emergency, with a call-up of 50,000 reservists to active
duty. The Justice Department is seeking increased authority for wider
surveillance, broader detention powers, wiretapping of persons (not, as
previously, just phone numbers), and stringent press restrictions on
military reporting.

And the petitions have begun. For justice but not vengeance. For a reasoned
response but against escalating retaliatory violence. For vigilance about
civil liberties. For the rights of innocent Muslim Americans. For bombing
Afghanistan with food and medical parcels, NOT firepower. There will be the
expectable peace marches, vigils, rallies. . . . One member of the House of
Representatives--Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, an African American
woman--lodged the sole vote in both houses of Congress against giving Bush
broadened powers for a war response, saying she didn't believe a massive
military campaign would stop terrorism. (She could use letters of support:
email her, if you wish, at barbara.lee@mail.house.gov.)

Those of us who have access to the media have been trying to get a
different voice out. But ours are complex messages with long-term
solutions--and this is a moment when people yearn for simplicity and
short-term, facile answers.

Still, I urge all of you to write letters to the editors of newspapers,
call in to talk radio shows, and, for those of you who have media
access--as activists, community leaders, elected or appointed officials,
academic experts, whatever--to do as many interviews and TV programs as you
can. Use the tool of the Internet. Talk about the root causes of terrorism,
about the need to diminish this daily climate of patriarchal violence
surrounding us in its state-sanctioned normalcy; the need to recognize
people's despair over ever being heard short of committing such dramatic,
murderous acts; the need to address a desperation that becomes chronic
after generations of suffering; the need to arouse that most subversive of
emotions--empathy--for "the other"; the need to eliminate hideous economic
and political injustices, to reject all tribal/ethnic hatreds and fears, to
repudiate religious fundamentalisms of every kind. Especially talk about
the need to understand that we must expose the mystique of violence,
separate it from how we conceive of excitement, eroticism, and "manhood";
the need to comprehend that violence differs in degree but is related in
kind, that it thrives along a spectrum, as do its effects--from the
battered child and raped woman who live in fear to an entire populace
living in fear.

Meanwhile, we cry and cry and cry. I don't even know who my tears are for
anymore, because I keep seeing ghosts, I keep hearing echoes. The world's
sympathy moves me deeply. Yet I hear echoes dying into silence: the world
averting its attention from the Rwandas screams. . . .

Ground Zero is a huge mass grave. And I think: Bosnia. Uganda.

More than 5400 people are missing and presumed dead (not even counting the
Washington and Pennsylvania deaths). The TV anchors choke up: civilians,
they say, my god, civilians. And I see ghosts. Hiroshima. Nagasaki.
Dresden. Vietnam.

I watch the mask-covered mouths and noses on the street turn into the faces
of Tokyo citizens who wear such masks every day against toxic pollution. I
watch the scared eyes become the fearful eyes of women forced to wear the
hajib or chodor or burka against their will. . . .

I stare at the missing posters' photos and think of the Mothers of the
Disappeared. And I see the ghosts of other faces. In photographs on the
walls of Holocaust museums. In newspaper clippings from Haiti. In
chronicles from Cambodia. . . .

I worry for people who've lost their homes near the site, though I see how
superbly social-service agencies are trying to meet their immediate and
longer-term needs. But I see ghosts: the perpetually homeless who sleep on
city streets, whose needs are never addressed. . . .

I watch normally unflappable New Yorkers flinch at loud noises, parents
panic when their kids are late from school. And I see my Israeli feminist
friends like Yvonne, who've lived with this dread for decades and still
(even yesterday) stubbornly issue petitions insisting on peace. . . .

I watch sophisticates sob openly in the street, people who've lost
workplaces, who don't know where their next paycheck will come from, who
fear a contaminated water or food supply, who are afraid for their sons in
the army, who are unnerved by security checkpoints, who are in mourning,
who feel wounded, humiliated, outraged. And I see my friends like Zuhira in
the refugee camps of Gaza or West Bank, Palestinian women who have lived in
precisely that emotional condition--for four generations.

Last weekend, many Manhattanites left town to visit concerned families, try
to normalize, get away for a break. As they streamed out of the city, I saw
ghosts of other travelers: hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees
streaming toward their country's borders in what is to them habitual
terror, trying to escape a drought-sucked country so war-devastated there's
nothing left to bomb, a country with 50,000 disabled orphans and two
million widows whose sole livelihood is begging; where the life expectancy
of men is 42 and women 40; where women hunch in secret whispering lessons
to girl children forbidden to go to school, women who risk death by
beheading--for teaching a child to read.

The ghosts stretch out their hands. Now you know, they weep, gesturing at
the carefree, insulated, indifferent, golden innocence that was my
country's safety, arrogance, and pride. Why should it take such horror to
make you see? The echoes sigh, Oh please do you finally see?

This is calamity. And opportunity. The United States--what so many of you
call America--could choose now to begin to understand the world. And join
it. Or not.

For now my window still displays no flag, my lapel sports no
red-white-and-blue ribbon. Instead, I weep for a city and a world. Instead,
I cling to a different loyalty, affirming my un-flag, my un-anthem, my
un-prayer--the defiant un-pledge of a madwoman who also had mere words as
her only tools in a time of ignorance and carnage, Virginia Woolf: "As a
woman I have no country. As a woman I want no country. As a woman my
country is the whole world."

If this is treason, may I be worthy of it.

In mourning--and absurd, tenacious hope,

Murat - I have always been partial to herring; however,
in this case it were appropriate to have consulted the
list archive before formulating your view.

Indeed I do assert that denouncing another subscriber
by name "represents a greater 'rhetorical violence'
than Selim Abdul Sadiq's post." Perhaps

this is the part where you express your incredulity.
As to the question of my judgement - well, this thing
seems rather imputation than plain inquiry.

Similarly, I recall once having heard a young boy ask
another in mixed company: "Still pick your nose?" In
my experience, the best response

to such an engaging conundrum is to walk on casually.
Or, as the Circle Jerks have it: "in the heat of the
summer / better call out a plumber."

I had the great fortune to meet Allen Curnow in Auckland, in the mid-80s,
when I was visiting Wystan, who wrote to this list, a few days ago, of his
father's death.

In his memory, here are two of his relatively early poems (with a couple of
links below):

WILD IRON

Sea go dark, dark with wind,
Feet go heavy, heavy with sand,
Thoughts go wild, wild with the sound
Of iron on the old shed swinging, clanging:
Go dark, go heavy, go wild, go round,
Dark with the wind,
Heavy with the sand,
Wild with the iron that tears at the nail
And the foundering shriek of the gale.

(from Island and Time,  1941)


& this one's for you, Wystan --

(I suppose all of us in New York are wishing, like you father --
"That the salt winds which scattered us blow softer")

ELEGY ON MY FATHER

Spring in his death abounds among the lily islands,
There to bathe him for the grave antipodean snows
Fall floodlong, rivermouths all in bloom, and those
Fragile church timbers quiver
By the bourne of his burial where robed he goes
No journey at all. One sheet's enough to cover
My end of the world and his, and the same silence.

While in Paddington autumn is air-borne, earth-given,
Day's nimbus nearer staring, colder smoulders;
Breath of a death not my own bewilders
Dead calm with breathless choirs
O bird-creation singing where the world moulders!
God's poor, the crutched and stunted spires
Thumb heavenward humorously under the unriven

Marble November has nailed across their sky:
Up there, dank ceiling is the dazzling floor
All souls inhabit, the lilied seas, no shore
My tear-smudged map mislimned.
When did a wind of the extreme South before
Mix autumn, spring and death? False maps are dimmed,
Lovingly they mock each other, image and eye.

The ends of the earth are folded in his grave
In sound of the Pacific and the hills he tramped singing,
God knows romantically or by what love bringing
Wine from a clay creek-bed,
Good bread; or by what glance the inane skies ringing
Lucidly round; or by what shuffle or tread
Warning the dirt of miracles. Still that nave

He knelt in puts off its poor planks, looms loftier
Lonelier than Losinga's that spells in stone
The Undivided Name. _Oh quickening bone
Of the Mass-priest under grass
Green in my absent spring, sweet relic atone
To our earth's Lord for the pride of all our voyages,
That the salt winds which scattered us blow softer. _

(London, November 1949)
