Hi Jeffrey

On you for the effort, but I am forced to conclude that the future of
poetry publishing is men. One woman out of 15 editors? Even with the
online contribution? I mean, don't give me the answer that there are
not woman editors out there - Kate Fagan (How2), Susan M. Schulz
(Tinfish) and me (Masthead) spring to my mind without even thinking.
I'm sure a quick rootle around would find dozens more.

I don't like adding up figures as if they mean something in
themselves, but here I think it's a problem.

All the best

Alison

Ship and Bell


"We therefore infer that the _effects of different permanent disturbing
forces acting under similar conditions on the same coordinate are not
simply proportional to their respective magnitudes but depend on their
periods."

"We therefore infer that _a disturbing force whose period and real expo-
nential are nearly the same as those of any one free vibration produces a
large forced vibration._"

"We conclude that _one effect of the resistances on a disturbing permanent
force, which would otherwise produce a magnified forced oscillation, is to
modify that oscillation and to keep it within bounds._"

"In the same way _heavy church bells_ can _be easily set in motion_ pro-
vided the pulls are properly timed. To increase the oscillation each rope
should be pulled only when it is descending. A large heavy ship can be
made to roll, when its natural time of oscillation is required, by running
a gang of men to and fro across the deck at the proper time; the men run
uphill."

(from Advanced Dynamics of a System of Rigid Bodies, Edward John Routh)

But if the men run uphill, surely the oscillation will ultimately be
damped since their effect in total would be to reduce the roll? Or does
the natural time depend on the minimization of the roll? Suppose on the
other hand the men run to and fro at the proper time - running downhill.
Then the oscillations will possibly increase as energy is added on the
downswing. With the descent of the bell, a pull raises it further,
increasing the potential energy. With the rolling of the ship, potential
energy is increased as the men running downward add to the slope. However
if upon running downward, the ship is rising, then the damping effect
might slow the rising of the ship, just as, if running upward, the ship is
sinking (sloping downward), the running will become first flat, then down-
ward, carrying the energy downward and pulling the roll. If the roll is
pushed, the roll is damped, if the men are running upward; if the roll is
pulled, the roll increases, if the men are running downward. The men run
first upward, then level, then downward, or first downward, then level,
then upward. Perhaps damping in the second case, increasing in the second.
Suppose the men _always_ run upward, then as the ship levels, the men stop
running; as it continues downward, the men turn around and run upward; the
damping is doubled. Suppose the men _always_ run downward, then as the
ship levels, the men stop running; as it continues upward, the men turn
around and run downward, the increase is doubled. By "doubled" one means
the force is applied twice on the swing, depending on the tilt of the
ship. In both cases, of the bell and the ship, gravity is paramount; one
runs or pulls against it, or one runs towards it, in which case pull is
impossible; however, a second cord might in fact pull the bell in an
opposite direction, just as the men might jostle from one side of the ship
to the other. Is this resonance, or the orders given to men, the acts of
men? The men follow the pull and push of the bell, slope of the deck of
the ship; there is no natural swing or pull here, only culture, commands,
actions in unison. The ship stops rolling or rolls over; the bell stops
ringing or turns full on its pivot. In any case, the dynamics are both
evident and peculiar; the men must experiment, over and over again, to
find the proper resonance, response. It is a difficult problem, settled
only in church, on the high seas, even though the dynamics are evident.

hi jeffrey,

i'm particularly interested in the responses to the role of the internet.

john bennett says "The Internet is fine, and it's wonderful for getting all
kinds of stuff out there so people can see it if they want to. But the
printed book and serial cannot be replaced - it's really how people read
anything closely, and it's also how things will last.  The Internet is a
kind of marketplace/exhibition/sample venue. The book is where you go to
read something deeply."

concerning what will last, i think it's less a matter of whether it's online
or in print (or whatever) as whether people continue to find the work
relevant and of interest. if it's online, the author or publishers have to
make the code available, when the work is programmed. sometimes the 'source
code' is simply html, so that is not so much of an issue; but sometimes the
source is programming code, and if the piece is to survive, the source needs
to be available for programmer-artists to work on it. i wasn't sure of this
a few years ago, but recent experience has shown me that when people are
interested in some work, they do what they need to in order to keep it
before the world. the poet-programmers (all 100 of them) make special
projects of recovering significant computer poetry; those with a particular
interest in other areas of poetry make special projects of doing what needs
to be done to keep the significant work from their area before the public,
etc. some significant work is lost, of course. but this is true across the
board.

it's been interesting to work on the bpNichol project i've mentioned here a
couple of times (that still isn't finished but still is in progress). we've
found that many professional archivists are more or less clueless about
digital archives. which seems to mean, at least for the time, that it's up
to the poet-programmers themselves to do the restoration/archiving. but i
wonder if that's any different in other areas where the documents/artifacts
are out of the ordinary.

as to where work is read deeply, again, i think that's less a matter of
whether the work is online or print (or whatever) as whether readers are
deeply engaged by the work. it may be that to engage people deeply in
digital work, the work should live somewhat differently than poetry has done
in print, but  there are many innovative digital works that are deeply
engaging. Check out, for instance, http://vispo.com/misc/links.htm , which
is my page of links to (usually) literary net art around the world. one of
the main things you'll note about most of those links is that while they are
often literary, they are also engaged in other arts and sometimes also in
programming; film would not be engaging simply as text or scrolling text;
neither is the internet. but the internet can deal with text much better
than film, and text in conjunction with other media.

john also says "the internet is a kind of marketplace/exhibition/sample
venue". and it is that. but it is more than that, for some people, even
concerning the literary. some people take it seriously as literary media. i
do. print is wonderful. but the digital and the internet open up formal and
social possibilities for poetry that print does not offer. it isn't a matter
of there having to be only one literary medium. there will be people who
follow poetry only in print or only online, but for those who are really
into poetry and not simply into print or the internet, surely they'll find
both relevant and broadening.

the internet brings poetry into relation with other arts, media, and
methods/processes that print cannot. it also allows for international
communication and exhibition/publication of poetry that was relatively rare
prior to the internet. additionally, it allows people who know what they're
doing to publish widely in ways that previously were the domain of only
institutions and those with money.

the internet is a force in changing and shaping the languages people read,
write and speak. it operates as a communication medium (via telephone or
instant messenging or email) and as a medium where documents, film,
interactive applications, images, queriable databases, and audio works mix
in an astonishing brew of languages and methods/processes. poetry has to be
there, and is. print isn't going away, but neither is the internet as
literary media.

happy new year to all on the poetics list!

Well it's January 1 -- a fine time for idealism.

I'm inclined to think that the biggest way to sell out is to not be true
to your self. (I warned you)

That is to say, if you're dumbing down poems to get
applause/laughter/whatever from a mass audience, that's one way of selling
out.  On the other hand,  if you're a straight ahead poet who is really
driven to write the kind of poems that a lot of normal citizens enjoy but
you crave recognition from the more academic side of the poetry world, you
just might sell out by going experimental and sucking up to that crowd.

Happy New Year.  Keep those poems flowing.

My first responsibility is to myself as a reader.  If I don't make something
that sustains me, then it won't satisfy others-- or if it does, it will be
fairly meaningless.

As a corollary to that, my responsibility is to produce nothing that is at
all false, if possible.  By false, I mean anything that glosses over, covers
up, oversimplifies, reduces, conceals, dumbs down, sucks up, or just plain
sucks.  I think that accessibility is a trick question: I have seen very
different reactions to the same poem, in both an audience and a classroom.
Is it possible to please everyone-- or if it is, should we try?  You may say
that's a cop out-- and here the argument becomes tautological: poetry is not
a popular art, so it should be held to different standards; poetry is not a
popular because it does not hold itself to the same standards.  But I say it
is a matter of being true to one's own standards, in any medium.  Yesterday
on the radio I heard George Martin saying John Lennon once told him he would
never expect to walk into a bar in Spain and hear sombody whistling "I Am
The Walrus."  Exactly.

I've never been a huge Olson fan, but his sense of the poem "at all points,
[being] a high-energy construct and, at all points, an energy discharge" has
always been a touchstone for me, and still is.

One further note on audience: there is something very liberating, wouldn't
you agree, in Frank O'Hara's "if they don't need poetry bully for them.  I
like the movies too."

And as for who was the bigger sell-out, Stein, Pound or Creeley-- another
trick question.  The answer, as far as I am concerned, is none of them...
unless one is thinking of Pound's bizarre attraction to Italian fascism.

an interesting question to me is about ³selling out². Don¹t poets have an
obligation to their audience, in terms of accessibility, for example. Why do
so many poets seem to punish their audience? If a poet notices that a
certain line, phrase, subject, etc, elicits more appreciation, is it selling
out to react, as an artist, to that knowledge?

Given the thread earlier about the suspicion that most people who read
poetry are poets; when performing at least poets can reach a wider audience.

The question is,
What obligation does a poet have to an audience?

Do you know, sometimes I think that we have the wrong idea about
who/what an audience is.

I've been reading this great book (by Svenbro, I forget the book's
exact name--sorry book, you were great. i remember you cover exactly,
the feel of it on my hands and on my back, the little gold imprints
and the red band on the cover as well) about how in ancient Greece,
all of the tombstones were written in the first person: "Glaukus made
me. I will last on and on"...and the like

This was way back before silent reading was invented. So readers
encountering these inscriptions would have to lend their voices, i.e.
pysically give over their bodies and, according to Svenbro allow
themselves to be sort of buggered by these inscriptions, which they
could give birth to well or badly.

I suppose today we might use a more institutionalized medical metaphor
for this buggering--via derrida--getting "buggered" by an injecting
needle--whether poison or health is injected, I'm uncertain
sometimes--in any case, what seems clear to me however, is that this
is a quite physical interaction, between (at least two )live,
independently chaotic bodies. It seems like we should go to theories
of ethics, Levinas or who was that that wrote On Touching?--to think
about how we face off against those who not only listen but lend their
bodies and often speak back and afford us--let's be honest, a certain
amout of pleasure as well.

I says, I agree with Charlie hisself. I wanna write
poesie - pretty as the prettier st man ever been on
celluloid, Paul Newman (and that's a fact). No stuffed
misrepresentations of life - or poems who calls
forbade the yawp, much preferring the faux banal
mutterings of devoid perception! Those poems that hide
behind conceit: says, dumbing poetry, when - as we
knows - the right words bring people to the truth.
Y'all diving in'a pockets for your own sake. The
bi-ped, said Pound, gotta walk on its two feet. I
read, 'cause I gotta define me-self, the experiment as

rarely empowering - how your fetishize mediocrity -
and I've seen yours websites.

And me pa is ILLITERATE - so I figure you bein'able to
read and write, figure what is I'M sayin' - and
reckon, also, given, I've READ your poems, you neither
understand OR ARE AUTHENTIC - so, show YOUR ASS - and
some of US will fuck it in'a sensibili-----TY. Many of
us are tired of how you've rednecked poetry into a
guetto - appropriating whatever whatnot!

(Podcast/Archive)

This morning Michael Krasny's Forum show featured a number of visual
artists, performers and composers(no poets) essentially talking of
innovative art programs involved in community works (engaging political
issues, engaging citizens in the process), as well as some of the
participants talking about ways in which the internet is impacting their
works.  The work of Joseph Beuys was one of the invoked.  Larry Rinder at
CCA and Richard Kamler (sculptor) at USF spoke of relatively new
multidisciplinary art's programs in 'social practice' at each of their
schools.

Interesting that this morning's program did not invite or consider ways in
which poets may be  actively also involved 'social practice'. (Not a lot of
names jump into my somewhat hung-over, partied out mind!)  Apart from poetry
in the schools programs - which may or may not stir the larger social well -
is any body (or group) on this list involved in teaching or non-teaching
situations in which a poetry program actively engages exploring ways in
which 'the word' (and its investigations) is re-contextualizing the way in
which art (language) may reconfigure the experience and/or change of public
and/or social space??

Or can any one name poets whose work may actively fit into the frame of 'a
social/public practice' - as say, maybe(?), different than a theoretical
one?  Or the artists in other media a leap ahead or a leap back here?

Curious!

We are experiencing some problems with our HTML/CSS code at absent

If there are any gurus who would like to examine the HTML and CSS style

One hates to sound like either a human torch or a
madman - some somebody, clearly, nobody loves. Oh, and
the head hurts, fire in the belly (as they say), this
wondering if should have stopped. But I don't want a
24 hr poetry marathon, any ebooks,
hype-sandwiched-hype. Americans, we know just how bad
fast food is -

In mandarin the sound a bee (xiao mi feng) makes is:
"wong-wong, wong-wong" Now, say that to yourself and
hearing the pretty sound resonate in your skull, think
about how perfect...

And here, 2007, a seal bone around my neck, from when
I lived on San Cristobal Island (and there are beaches
in the Galapagos where seals go to die), hunk of rock
from Himalaya on my desk, oh China China China, in my
ear a conversation about how my friend's bi-racial
little boy was nearly stolen for the slave trade in
South China by biker gangs few days ago...over beer
cured in formaldehyde...CANTON...GUANGZHOU...and then
letters from Robert Creeley, the last a few hours
before his death - loving.

Had this dream about a woman biting my nipples, her
lips like snapdragons, snap-snap-snap, and she looks
up at me, her spirit filled with my contempt, my crude
words cunningly mouthed, and says: Thank you for your
poison.

Experimental poets? There are so few, yet so damn many
on this list reckon themselves to be. Yep, he said:
REALLY want some kinda war. But there is a big
problem, I think, and that is that poetry is
suffering, that those who are supposed to be
protecting both the artform and us, and encouraging
cultural work, are more likely than not responsible
for poetry's slack misuses.

And then there're NO subterraneans in Beijing, he said
- only Misfits, said I (one of THEM). And why say
this? Because I/ know (just how foolish, said, some of
you have been). But I've heard bigoted men read
Langston Hughes - coloring "white junk" - saying y'all
- and you can too...(on the radio).

Again: oh, the head, last whiskey on the rocks,
remembering what David posted, some words by Golda
Maier, about how there is no such thing as a
Palestinian - and I thought, yes: If we erase them,
than we don't need to see 'em. And I say to myself -
reminding myself, I say, all the best doctors in Iran,
so said Kashim, are Jews - but again, this reference
to Armstrong: What a wonderful world.

I'm outta here - Midwest byway of a so'westa. Three
days of full on - full power, as they say in India
-beer guzzling! Nope! I am not a Christian.

Those Tibetans need support - as does everyone who
REALLY has something to say. Back channel me c/o of
bangdrum@hotmail.com and I will forward email
addresses of some good men, good writers, refugees
without a country (or a home) - but, alas, write out
whatever need one writes.

Anyone know how I can help rebuild New Orleans, please
back channel me c/o bangdrum@hotmail.com (would be
nice if the high-end developers would stay out!) I
don't mind chocolate cities - any folksy one'll do -
do mind appropriation, however.

When I talked about secession, was referring to
Austrian art movement led by likes of Klimt and
Scheile. Rauschenburg - check 'im out - expand Eliot's
Auditory Imagination -

Apologize for being tactless. If anything, appreciate
my ethics - and my work (but no need worry about me).

i think you have it all wrong, alexander. poetry, having long ago died, has
never felt better. moves like smoke in the air. gets into everything. film.
theatre. visual art. music. interactive applications. you name it. poetry is
to art in general as brian eno is to music. not a 'supporting role'; but
what gives its language force and care, intensity. poetry is beyond
suffering; we are the ones suffering. but it's still on call.

poetry can't be protected. needs no protection. is dead. loves trouble
anyway. if someone wants to hurt it, they swing at the air. can't lay a
glove on it. it always knows if you're serious and is at your side when you
are. no not at your side. you're it.

experimental poetry is, in a sense, the only poetry. if its already been
done, how can you expect to keep poetry's attention? she was there the first
time.

Regarding the interest level for the three web journals I proposed
last week, the results are now in.

I received input from 19 different people, the results of which can be
summarized as:

Close Reading -- 7 expressed an interest in providing content, 1
indicated there was a print journal doing this, and 1 pointed me to
their own blog doing something similar.

Instantiation -- 9 expressed an interest in providing content, 1
indicated a principled refusal to issue manifestos.

subgenres -- 3 expressed an interest in editing a specific category, 1
indicated that their notion of a subgenre was more content-driven than
my examples, and 1 indicated that this one would be the most fun of
the three to read.

So, the end result is that I'm just not seeing sufficient interest in
these to justify the effort at this time. Instead, I'll use the time
I'd been planning to allocate to these things on a few projects that
are more individual than community oriented...the upside to being an
idea factory is that there's never really a shortage of things to work
on.

I would like to thank everyone who responded for their input, it
helped me determine where my resources will be best spent.

Regards,
Dan

*United Artists Books*
http://www.unitedartistsbooks.com/

**United Artists Books (formerly Angel Hair Books) was founded in 1967. It
is one of the oldest independent publishing companies in the United States
that focuses primarily on publishing books of poetry.

During the last 40 years we have published numerous books, many of which ar=
e
no longer in print. Among our authors are Robert Creeley, James Schuyler,
Alice Notley, David Rosenberg, Ron Padgett, Charlotte Carter, Lorenzo
Thomas, Tom Clark, Ted Berrigan, Bernadette Mayer, Bill Berkson, Hannah
Weiner, Anne Waldman, John Wieners, and Clark Coolidge.

Some of the artists who have contributed covers to United Artists/Angel Hai=
r
Books are Philip Guston, Joe Brainard, Donna Dennis, Alex Katz, James
Rosenquist, George Schneeman, Amy Trachtenberg, Louise Hamlin, Jim Dine,
Martha Diamond, Emilie Clark, Pamela Lawton, Rosemary Mayer, Sophia Warsh,
and Anne Tardos.  =20

The press has received numerous grants and awards from the National
Endowment for the Arts, the New York State Council on the Arts, the
Massachusetts Foundation for the Arts, and the Coordinating Council of
Literary Magazines. It has been our primary goal to publish poets whose
works are well known and well-respected within the poetry community but
unknown to a wider audience.

In an article in The Baltimore Sun a few years back, Andrei Codrescu
described United Artists as a small press "on the cutting edge of American
poetry for the last twenty years. The series of books by United Artists is
indispensable for any library collection or anyone interested in the future
of poetry."

This showed up on youtube a while back.  Appears to be the
inauguration of an art center in Zurich which references the ideas of
Bern Porter.  The video starts out slow but it was more than a bit
eerie to hear my 1988 recording of Bern reading Last Acts of Saint
Fuck You inserted into their opening presentation.

Yes, granted, selling out is bad thing, is inauthentic, is disingenuous
somehow =AD is trying to sell you something, the beauty of poetry being that
nobody is trying to sell you anything.

However that begs the question, should poetry not make you want to =B3buy=B2 it=
?

I Hope that appreciation from normal citizens versus the academic side of
poetry is not mutually exclusive.

The question remains what obligation any poet has to an audience;

to entertain
to be accessible
to meet the audience

and if any of these things are true, why do many poets pointedly practice
none of the above?

i suppose its also interesting to extend the audience from the physical
performance or reading space to being off the written page, and ask what a
writer owes a reader.


yon thoughts?

an interesting question to me is about =B3selling out=B2. Don=B9t poets have an
obligation to their audience, in terms of accessibility, for example. Why d=
o
so many poets seem to punish their audience? If a poet notices that a
certain line, phrase, subject, etc, elicits more appreciation, is it sellin=
g
out to react, as an artist, to that knowledge?

Given the thread earlier about the suspicion that most people who read
poetry are poets; when performing at least poets can reach a wider audience=
.
=20
The question is,
What obligation does a poet have to an audience?

"Selling out" is a bit bizarre to think of in the context of poetry. A
little precious, perhaps? Who's buying?

> The question is,
> What obligation does a poet have to an audience?

None, I'd say. But a great obligation to the art of poetry.

All best

Re: Ghosts in the machine...

Has anyone read Specimen Days, by Michael Cunningham. It may not be =20
"poetry", to those who choose to strictly define a sculpture of words, =20
but it is very good fiction... and sort of about poetry! Quite =20
demanding of the reader's attentions, this is not your ordinary =20
cookie-cutter fiction! Quoting Whitman throughout, the book is divided =20
into three stories, of which I have only read two so far... I am =20
taking my time reading this one. Here is a better explanation of this =20
book, taken from a review by New York Magazine. Would be a great =20
discussion piece, if anyone has read it!? Yes?  No?  --T.F. Rice
----------------------------------------------------------------------------=
----
In his new book?a trio of linked novellas titled Specimen =20
Days?Cunningham quotes Walt Whitman as amply as he once quoted Woolf. =20
Although the relationship has the same near-death intensity, the =20
chemistry is different. It isn?t clear that Cunningham likes Whitman, =20
for one thing. The three novellas?a ghost story, a neo-noir tale, and =20
a turn at science fiction?feel rather like attempts at exorcism. When =20
characters quote the poet, they?re displaying not an affinity but a =20
symptom. A self-destructive boy blurts out lines of Whitman?s verse as =20
if they were the expletives of a Tourette?s patient or the =20
calculations of an autistic. Terrorists cite Leaves of Grass to =20
justify suicide bombings. A robot with runaway emotionality is =20
irritated by an implanted poetry chip, which causes him to say, ?I =20
understand the large hearts of heroes, the courage of present times =20
and all times,? to a surveillance drone considering whether to zap him =20
into molten titanium and gobbets of artificial flesh.

Put Whitman?s lyric ideas into a novel, and you get a disquieting =20
plot: Romantic freedom leads to nothing but death. Because people tend =20
to read narratives as if the ending were the moral of the story, a =20
defender of romantic freedom might be tempted to force a happy =20
ending?to sentimentalize mere death. In such lines of Whitman?s as ?to =20
die is different from what anyone supposed, and luckier,? D. H. =20
Lawrence heard a hint that the surrender of self at life?s end might =20
qualify as a kind of salvation. ?Post-mortem effects,? Lawrence called =20
such thinking. He loathed it.

In Specimen Days, Cunningham seems to be trying to work through those =20
effects. He quotes Whitman?s line about the luckiness of death several =20
times. Like its predecessors, the new book ends with a corpse. The =20
innovation is that it also starts with one. ?Walt said that the dead =20
turned into grass,? says 12-year-old Lucas, who has just lost his =20
older brother to an industrial accident, ?but there was no grass where =20
they?d buried Simon.? Lucas lives in 1870s New York, and he fears that =20
the dawning machine age has made Whitman?s wishful thinking about =20
death come horribly true. What if Simon?s soul lives on in the =20
machines that mangled him, and he wants to steal away his still-living =20
fianc=E9e, Catherine?

This strikes me as close to entirely wrong.  E.g., here is Lawrence
on Whitman and death, Chapter 12 of Studies in Classic American
Literature:

"Whitman would not have been the great poet he is if he had not taken
the last steps and looked over into death. Death, the last merging,
that was the goal of his manhood."

And here is Lawrence on what he meant by "post-mortem effects" (Chapter 11):

"If the Great White Whale sank the ship of the Great White Soul in
1851, what's been happening ever since?

"Post-mortem effects, presumably."

Seems to me that reviewer is playing it too fast & too loose.  But it
*is* interesting to hear about Cunningham's book.

Best,

Joe

I think what Cralan is saying is really very
important.
And these conversations, I think, tend to the
dishonest. Before I continue, let me say that I mean
no disrespect to anyone - certainly, and nothing's
personal. No more hateful emails, or telling me about
whatever portfolio you've written.

First, on Creeley: Creeley selling out is just not
knowing enough about him, I wanna say - and I'm not
the expert, for I think he is only - but he suffered a
long time, made little money, read in some of the most
obscure locations, supported a hellofalotta people,
and did this for most of life. He wrote and he wrote
for one reason, he thought he had something to say.
Too, he spoke to real people. In wasn't until the end
of his life, I think most would agree, that he really
began to worry about his place.

Now, this idea of dumbing down poetry, even to use
this garbled and hackneyed phrase, I think, is
insulting - and really supposes the poet has something
to say (or is perceptive). I mean, isn't that the
question? Not just how to say it, how theatrical to
sing it, but what to say - how to inform culture and,
thus, do cultural work. Academic poets are the
criminals to the poetry set, but the poetry set, some
represented here, is certainly criminal in their
delusion of poetry mattering - in their delusion that
their audience is more than groupies or hangers-on,
young poets wanting to be poets, people drawn to the
glam of poetry's hyper-synthetic scene. Ok, the hate
mail. But I've read in NYC, Prague, Beijing, college
campuses - lots of places...and it's usually the same.

Poetry matters, I think, not because of me, but rather
because it has something to do, is an offshoot of a
need. This is all so silly. I mean, go to your street
corner and talk to those folk you see and convince
them poetry isn't archaic - and is still being
written. Read some of the online work about sitting at
a cafe, or some self-indulgent tripe. I really do
think that one thing about the internet is that many
of us are allowed to actually believe we are important
- maybe because we get listed in google as many times
as Frogsex.com

And this is the from, I submit, that younger poets are
gonna be constrained by - till poetry, and maybe its
that way now, is like most of the pop music we listen
to for a week or month - throw-away.

Just a thought.

AJ

One of those hilarious moments of serendipidity--
this question of audience arises just as the photos of MLA off site reading
are going up--

i liked what alison croggan wrote, that the obligation is to poetry--
for me it's a form of thanks for being present in the presence of the
present--
which doesn't require any audience other than the material one is working
with--and whatevr is all around one--animal vegetable mineral general junk
and debris etc --
and since work outside on rubBEings and clay impression spray
paintings--audience is also passersby--through time about every sort of
person--stops and watches, talks--including the occaisional police, security
guard, property owner--(one recently tried to tackle me thinking i was
attaching explosive device to "his" crane, when was making clay impression
of letterings on the huge tires--doesn't help to wear black clothes with
black hooded sweatshirt and running shoes!--)--who also take an interest and
ask questions--

the "audience" is literally "the person on the street"--which makes it a lot
more interesting for all concerned as always the unexpected--
"I do not seek, I find"--so sayeth sr picasso--passersby & work find each
other--i get to be in the audience, too--

a chance meeting at any time and place--no set time and place and audience
for poetry--but anytime anywhere anyone--

(and since there are no placards announcing any event, one can oneself be
anybody--unless asked to produce "proof of identity" which narrows it down
to one name--for the moment--and then when that passerby passes by, one can
return to being anybody--)

Carla Harryman writes:

The Adventurous is a breakaway satire that behaves like a free being on
a raging escapade. Funny, base, brainy, and big, its multi-pitched
prose is a self-unsparing and timely assault on stupidity produced by
normalizing regimes and the repressive gender systems we intellectuals
like to pretend only exist someplace else.

If you try to take a picture in the immediate vicinity of the Bechtel
building in San Francisco, the security guard stops you, even if - as I was
once - taking a photograph of the building rising from the public plaza
between the buildings.  Turning the situation around, I asked the security
guard if I could take his picture. He was a little taken aback by my kind
attention. But refused by saying that he did not like think he looked 'good
enough' to be photographed that particular gray morning. Alternatively, he
did not also say that his body was a security site that also needed to be
protected from cameras and 'suspicious' documentation - it was Bechtel, the
building that was his calling.
I honored his personal request not 'to shoot' him.

And what an ugly dark building!  I think they have since moved the
headquarters to a safe non-City site somewhere.

Parenthetically I wonder how the Gerald Ford family feels about having two
war criminals (Cheney, Rumsfeld) as honorary pall bearers.  Trying to
resurrect their careers via a casket!!  Wow. Let's hope - minimally - they
get the Pinochet treatment for the rest of their lives.

Writing Experiments Workshop
Dodie Bellamy

Due to the success of fall's writing experiments workshop I'm
offering a slightly shorter version of the workshop this spring.  The
class will meet 8 Tuesday evenings, from 7 to 10 p.m.  The dates:
January 30 through April 3 (no class Feb. 13 and March 20).  Cost:
$300, with a $100 deposit due by January 24.

Most weeks students will be assigned a short take-home writing
experiment which they will share with the class the following week.
Assignments will range from cut ups to exploring bodily sensations.
Each week we will also critique longer pieces by two to five
students.  Students may bring in anything they want (up to 20 pages)
for the longer critiques.  Depending on the length, these longer
pieces will be read aloud in class or handed out a week ahead of
time.  Though this class will have a prose focus, it is cross-genre,
and poets are welcome.  The class is limited to 9 students.  Lots and
lots of personal attention.  It takes place in San Francisco, in my
South of Market apartment, which comes complete with snacks and two
cats.

This is a good class for poets wanting to play around with narrative
or prose writers wanting to open up their prose.  It will be the last
workshop I'll be doing for a while.

Pink Steam, my collection of fiction, memoir, and memoiresque essays,
was published in 2004 by San Francisco's Suspect Thoughts Press.  My
vampire novel, The Letters of Mina Harker was reprinted by University
of Wisconsin Press, also in 2004.  Academonia, a book of essays, is
just out from Krupskaya, and is available at Small Press Distribution:

<http://www.spdbooks.org/Details.asp?BookID=1928650252>

I'm the author of 3 other books and I teach creative writing at SF
State and in the MFA program at Antioch Los Angeles.  I've also
taught at CalArts, Naropa summer session, Mills, USF, UC Santa Cruz,
and the SF Art Institute.  I've received the Bay Guardian Goldie
Award for Literature and the Firecracker Alternative Book Award for
Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about work samples, etc.  Or--if
you know anybody who might be interested, please pass this email
along to them.  If you're interested do contact me promptly.
Preference given to those not currently enrolled in a grad writing
program.  I'm going out of town for a few days so I may not get back
to you until after January 11.

Barry Alpert sent me this item from the Washington D.C. CITY PAPER -- The kicker comes in paragraph four, where we learn what turned  the trick with the Dana Gioia NEA --
The Verse InterestsBooksBy Sarah Godfrey

When John Smith received a late-morning phone call at work from National Endowment for the Arts chair Dana Gioia, it didn&rsquo;t take him long to realize what it was in regard to. &ldquo;As soon as [Gioia] identified himself, I figured what it was,&rdquo; says Smith, 43.

The news, however, would take a little longer to set in. Gioia rang Smith up at his day job at the Inter-American Development Bank, where he serves as an editor, to tell him he&rsquo;d just won a huge honor in his other profession&mdash;as a poet. Smith was awarded a $20,000 NEA Literature Fellowship in Poetry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still a little stunned about the whole thing,&rdquo; the Southwest resident says.



Smith was one of only 50 poets nationwide to be awarded a grant and the only Washington, D.C., poet to snag a fellowship, but he hopes his gain will benefit D.C. poets other than himself. &ldquo;This is not just for me&mdash;it kind of shows and hints at the amount of poetic activity that goes on in Washington,&rdquo; Smith says. &ldquo;There are several different scenes and some very good people&mdash;a lot of them have been very supportive [of me].&rdquo;



Smith is the author of two volumes of poetry&mdash;2005&rsquo;s Settling for Beauty and 1999&rsquo;s The Hypothetical Landscape&mdash;and edited Northern Music: Poems About and Inspired by Glenn Gould, an anthology of writing about the Canadian musician. Smith&rsquo;s poems, essays, and fiction have appeared in publications as diverse as crime-fiction Web site Thuglit.com and the self-described &ldquo;modern dog culture magazine&rdquo; The Bark. He&rsquo;s also recently completed a children&rsquo;s book slated for publication in 2008. Still, poetry &ldquo;is at the center of what I do,&rdquo; Smith says.



Having unsuccessfully submitted his work to the NEA twice before sending his latest application in February of this year, what finally worked for Smith was sending in a collection of formal verse rather than a sampling of his free-verse poems. After a &ldquo;nerve-wracking&rdquo; selection process, he decided on &ldquo;a polished collection of formal verse&mdash;or at least as polished as I know how to make it&mdash;rather than include a little bit of everything,&rdquo; Smith says. &ldquo;I tried the eclectic manuscript before. It hadn&rsquo;t worked, [so I] decided to put all of my eggs in one basket.&rdquo;



Smith&rsquo;s next big decision will be what to do with the unexpected windfall. For its part, NEA has helped him narrow his list of options: The grant is to be used for research, travel, and time off from one&rsquo;s regular job to allow more time to write&mdash;not, say, for a down payment on a new house or paying off a car note.



&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t send me a check,&rdquo; Smith says. &ldquo;[The money] is held in an escrow account and drawn down for specific purposes&mdash;it&rsquo;s taxable. It&rsquo;s not really a license for irresponsibility.

Hello, all!

The duo I play with, the Prince Myshkins, will make a quick sweep of NYC, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts later this month, and we'd be particularly excited if some of you poet types could make it (being poet types ourselves when we're not doing this). We write and perform satirical songs about a wide variety of topics (ranging from the "war on terror," talk radio, traffic and activist nuns to girly men, arts funding, homelessness and "free trade"). Most of the songs are funny and (hopefully) thought-provoking; we try to juxtapose issues that don't intuitively belong together in order to bring out surprising connections and possibilities. Lots of words, with elaborate internal rhyming patterns, often delivered at a ridiculous pace in tight harmonizations of melodies whose strangeness doesn't seem to prevent them from being catchy.  The music (performed on guitar and accordion) is pretty wide-ranging, but when people ask we cite our major influences as Kurt Weill, Tom Lehrer
 and the Muppets.

We do well with poets (Rae Armantrout and Jerome Rothenberg are big west coast fans). Our credentials include airplay on "Democracy Now" and "Morning Edition;" "Sing Out" magazine says, "Anyone who aspires to write political satire should hear this brilliant duo." More stuff about us and the upcoming shows can be found at
http://www.princemyshkins.com

Hope some of you can come to these concerts!

JANUARY
19--Greenfield, MA--All Souls' Unitarian Church
Jobs for Justice Benefit (w/Charlie King and Karen Brandow). 8 p.m.

20--Boston, MA--Workmen's Circle, 8 p.m.

22--NYC--Bowery Poetry Club

25--Bethlehem, PA--Godfrey Daniels, 7:30 p.m.

all the best,

I have one question. Isn't writing innovative poetry a formal strategy?

Happy new year to all.

I see Barry sent that article to the whole list -- apologies for the repetition --

and yes, writing innovative poetry is a formal strategy -- perhaps even a winning strategy -- just won't win you an NEA these days --

Frozen in time: the disabled nine-year-old girl
who will remain a child all her life
Ed Pilkington in New York
Thursday January 4, 2007 - The Guardian

Ashley's parents call her their Pillow Angel, a
moniker that is a reference to the love and joy they
feel for their nine-year-old daughter and the severe
disabilities she has suffered from birth. She cannot
sit up, walk or talk, is fed by tube, and, as her
parents put it, "stays right where we place her -
usually on a pillow".
Ashley won't know this, as she is brain-damaged and
has the awareness, her doctors say, of a baby, but she
has become the subject of a passionate argument in
disability circles and beyond. Her name is becoming
synonymous with the debate about the acceptable limits
of medical intervention in the care of disabled
people.

The cause of the controversy is the "Ashley Treatment"
- a course of surgery and hormone supplements devised
for her at her parents' request and with the blessing
of doctors - that will for ever keep her small. It
involves surgical operations, including a
hysterectomy, and hormone prescriptions that will, in
effect, freeze-frame her body at its current size.
Although she has a normal life expectancy, she will,
physically, always be nine years old. Her growth has
been suspended at 4ft 5in (1.3 metres), rather than
the 5ft 6in she would probably otherwise have become.
Her weight will stick at around 75lb (34kg) rather
than 125lb.

This week Ashley's parents, who have chosen to remain
anonymous and have only let it be known that they are
"college-educated professionals" living in Washington
state, have posted on the internet a lengthy
explanation of their desire to stunt her growth. It is
the first time they have given a public account of
their actions. The explanation is accompanied by a
gallery of photographs showing Ashley over the years,
from her as a smiling baby a few months old, through
to today when she is seen nestled in a sheepskin rug.

She was diagnosed, they explain, with brain damage
with unknown causes just after birth and has remained
at the same developmental level since about three
months. Three years ago she began to show early signs
of puberty, and they grew anxious about the impact of
fertility and of her rapidly increasing size and
weight on the quality of her life. In discussions with
doctors at Seattle Children's hospital they devised
the treatment: removal of Ashley's uterus to prevent
fertility, excision of early buds on her chest so that
she would not develop breasts, and medication with
high doses of oestrogen to limit her growth by
prematurely fusing the growth plates of her bones.

The parents insist that the treatment, carried out in
2004, was conceived for Ashley's benefit and not their
own ease or convenience. With a lighter body and no
breasts, Ashley will have fewer bed sores and lie more
comfortably. And a smaller Ashley can be cared for and
carried. "As a result we will continue to delight in
holding her in our arms and Ashley will be moved and
taken on trips more frequently instead of lying in her
bed staring at TV or the ceiling all day long," they
write.

But as news about the treatment became known, Ashley's
parents were surprised by the virulence of some of the
response. Comments on chatboards have included: "Ouch
- this smacks of eugenics"; "I find this offensive,
truly a milestone in our convenience society"; "This
smells, I can't agree with this".

Outrage has also been expressed by organisations
representing disabled people across the US, with many
asking why a course of treatment that would not be
countenanced for an able-bodied person should be
allowed in this case. "People have been horrified by
the discrepancy," said Mary Johnson, editor of Ragged
Edge, an online magazine for disability activists.

She said she felt for Ashley's parents and could
understand why they had made the decision. But she
feared that the treatment would open a Pandora's box
that could have adverse effects for other children.
"What will now be said in the case of a child with
spina bifida, who you could argue has the same
physical challenges but whose brain is fully
functioning? This is very troubling."

Debate has raged among doctors and medical ethicists.
Jeffrey Brosco of Miami University has co-written an
editorial in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent
Medicine criticising the procedure as an experiment
without proper research controls. "This is a
technological solution to a social problem. I work
with severely disabled children and know how hard it
is on families, but what we need most is better
federal funding so that they can be cared for
properly."

State help for caring for disabled people is available
through Medicaid, which is restricted to poor
families. Ashley's parents would not qualify, and say
it is impossible to find carers they can afford.

The ethical row is likely to deepen as the Seattle
doctors, led by Daniel Gunther, say they are
considering other children for similar treatment,
though only after monitoring by the hospital's ethics
committee. The doctors accept that Ashley's
hysterectomy was contentious, given the dark history
of sterilisation of disabled people in Europe and
America, and that there were risks involved in the
operations and oestrogen doses.

But they argue the benefits outweigh the risks. Ashley
has, they admit, been "infantilised" but question the
harm that would do a person whose mental capacity
"will always be that of a young child".

Ashley cannot say what she thinks. But in a telephone
interview with the Guardian last night, her father
said that many people had assumed he and his wife had
to agonise over their decision.

"We didn't. It was easy," he said. "We clearly saw the
benefits to Ashley's quality of life. We have also
been criticised for harming Ashley's dignity. But for
us, what would be grotesque would be to allow a fully
formed woman to grow up, lying helplessly and with the
mentality of a three-month-old."

Hormones

There is a long history of hormones being used to
control growth in children. In some cases they are
used to counteract a hormonal imbalance or genetic
disorder. But there have also been sustained attempts
to control body size for cosmetic reasons.

In 1956 MA Goldzieher became the first to report using
high doses of oestrogen to treat exceptionally tall
girls. Over ensuing years thousands of tall girls were
prescribed oestrogen to prevent them tipping over the
6ft mark, protecting their marriage prospects. As the
stigma against tallness in women has declined, so has
the practice, though it still continues.

Boys considered to be shorter than the norm have
recently begun to be treated with a growth hormone,
often for cosmetic reasons. US federal restrictions
have been loosened, allowing private paediatricians to
offer the treatment that can cost up to $40,000 a
year.

on the matter harry ross mentioned about the tendency to express ideas about
evolution with a teleological inflection...

it's an interesting issue.

turning the same issue toward the ai question:

all computer code is written. in languages.

*how can you have coded language without a writer?*

what inscriptional systems in the body or the universe do we understand that
can help us with this question?

dna?

is that a language? why or why not?

talk about the death of the author...ehe.

the invention/discovery of code/language/reading-writing that lacks a
writer.

same sort of interesting issue as expressing evolutinary ideas without a
teleological inflection.

ja?

Subject:      White Columns NYC:  Dodie Bellamy digs through Kathy Acker's stuff
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Kathy Acker, the novelist and theorist, died from breast cancer in
1997.  Her papers are at Duke, but her clothes and accessories remain
in the possession of her executor Matias Viegener.  Beginning
Tuesday, January 9 I will display a selection of Kathy Acker's
clothes at White Columns in New York City, and on Wednesday, January
10 at 7:30 I will give a presentation, "Digging Through Kathy Acker's
Stuff."  Last February while visiting Viegener in Los Angeles, I
rummaged through Acker's extravagant designer wardrobe, and wheedled
one of her Gautier dresses from him, and a couple pieces of jewelry.
Possessing such intimate effects of a woman I wasn't so much friends
with as in awe of, I felt compelled to write it all out.  I meditate
upon relics, ghosts, compulsive shopping, archives, make-up, our
drive to mythologize the dead, Acker's own self-mythologizing, the
struggle among followers to define Acker, bitch fights, and the
numina of DNA.

Details about the general exhibit are below.

Hope to see you there!

Ohio is warm and sick with winds.
Trains moan  through winter evening dark,
memorializing distance. Explosions  poppy,
woven from pixels from an abandoned game

 in the woods; Alex found an arm there,
lying on  the grass. It was grasping coughs.
This is what it means to be  precious.

 The War rouged over, grumpy, wearing  your
sweater, won't cool if you blow on it.
We grew up in imagined  engines, in graveyards
lying face-down among a pool of  rhododendron.

 We made honey. And all our lower levels  flood.

he said print is what people read deeply, not stuff on the internet.

it *is* hard to read stuff on the internet deeply.

what we can do on the internet deeply is a bit different from read. or so i
find, in my own reading of online work.

i think we start out not reading texts but watching videos or looking at
pictures, or listening to audio, or playing games, or chatting, or playing
with interactive works. that's what we're first attracted to in work, and
then, if we're interested in that work and want to know more, we eventually
get around to reading texts.

and from there it's a matter of going to and fro between and within media.
not to the exclusion of texts, but within an integrated or at least related
approach to various media. go fast and then go slow. go visual and then to
the written word, use more of our senses and drive the computer like a
mindbat.

HI Stephen,

yes, (blowing trumpet) ethical issues of social/cultural/public (ALL
problematic terms) poetic practice are very much the nub of my book
imminent from Pantarchy 'the church, the school, the beer'. The work
was made 'live' on a street corner in a small english city, Norwich.
It was talked and narrowcast (via CB radio) throughout, including
conversations with passers-by, taxi drivers, witnesses etctera.
(http://www.plantarchy.us/Plantarchy_3.html) Similar timeframe to the
tnwk conversation piececs such as the 'mayday' project and subsequent
Millennium Collection, which directly preface projects lilke post
secrets. Also Radio Taxi . . . from tnwk.

I am still working in developments out of this vein.
Here in Oxford the question what is a social poem is in circulation?

love and love
cris

Hi mIEKAL,=20


yes, i have to admit that i find the process intriguing,
in terms of the =B3art=B2 of printing, and how its a lifestyle and an art as
much as writing itself.
Perhaps that=B9s why its endured for 35 years, for example, I imagine that
most of the poets on this list will write for 35 years (hopefully more).

I like reading the bibliography because the longer i read & write, the more
people who i once idealised become real people, and i seek parallels, in
terms of the pursuit of writing and the interactions we all have with each
other. The first time i saw the writers=B9 names they were just names amongst
hundreds of poets, these sort of mythological creatures who somehow made
these small compelling books, and over time they become more accessible and
human.=20

It took me a while to think about the fact that the people who wrote the
books didn=B9t actually make them.

we went and visited susan & bob arnold in vermont, where they live in an ou=
t
of the way place, on a river tucked in the trees.

trying to get my mind round how books are actually put together. Also
visited Erica van Horn & Simon Cutts of Coracle in Ireland, where they live
near tipperary and make books in a small stone workshop with a calming
widescreen view over green green fields.

I=B9ve never been to visit Buffalo, although Simon Cutts told me that there
are people there in the poetics program who practice the art of making
books, etc.

of course, longhouse is different than large publishers who produce books, =
&
i think maybe a defining difference is that Longhouse  corresponds
with the writers whose work they use, versus publishing house contracts,
although I have no idea how that world works.

another  press that intrigues me is Jargon Society, whom I think of as the
original Gentlemen publishers. They=B9ve posted extensive writings by Jeffery
Beam on their website, detailing this process;
http://jargonbooks.com/snowflake1.html

in this case the bibliography of longhouse is so nice to read because it
illustratively explains step-by-step how small publications come into
existence.

i think what i am getting at is that theres more than just the books & the
form here. There are stories behind the publications are half as interestin=
g
as the books themselves, like listening to poets talk about stories behind
poems.

Kristy Bowen in alice blue, Roy Bentley in pavement saw, and Gordon
Massman. Tune in, read some poems and enjoy the low-cal commentary
thereafter.

Pluto's revenge: 'Word of the Year' award
POSTED: 10:56 a.m. EST, January 7, 2007

(CNN) -- Pluto may no longer be a planet, but it has a new claim to
fame: "Plutoed" has been chosen 2006 Word of the Year by the American
Dialect Society.

The society defined "to pluto" as "to demote or devalue someone or
something, as happened to the former planet Pluto when the General
Assembly of the International Astronomical Union decided Pluto no
longer met its definition of a planet."

The former planet had some tough competition in the voting, which
took place Friday at the ADS' annual meeting, held in Anaheim,
California.

"Plutoed" won in a runoff against "climate canary," defined as "an
organism or species whose poor health or declining numbers hint at a
larger environmental catastrophe on the horizon."

The runner-up was "macaca" or "macaca moment," defined as "treating
an American citizen as an alien" -- a reference to a campaign remark
by former Virginia Sen. George Allen that some say marked the
beginning of the end for his re-election hopes.

Also in the running for Word of the Year were YouTube; surge
(referring to a large, but brief, increase in troop strength); and
flog ("a fake blog created by a corporation to promote a product or a
television show").

Like any good awards show, the ADS meeting had multiple categories.

In the "Most Unnecessary" category, "SuriKat" (the supposed nickname
of the baby girl of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes) beat out "the
decider," President Bush's description in April of his position in
relation to whether Donald Rumsfeld kept his job as secretary of
defense.

The "Most Outrageous" award went to "Cambodian accessory," defined as
"Angelina Jolie's adopted child who is Cambodian."

In the "Most Euphemistic" category, the winner was "waterboarding,"
defined as "an interrogation technique in which the subject is
immobilized and doused with water to simulate drowning."

The ADS has been choosing Words of the Year since 1990. The Word of
the Year for 2005 was "truthiness," invented by Comedy Central's "The
Colbert Report," and defined by the ADS as "what one wishes to be the
truth regardless of the facts." (Read the full list of winners for
2006 and past years)

Winning words or phrases don't have to be brand new; what's important
is that they gained new prominence in the past year.
The society is dedicated to the study of the English language in
North America, and includes academics, writers, and others.

I love America, I who can't say the national anthom.

Love it for its folksy, for all those mongrels and
tainted and tatty folk.

For the churches down South, where I, an angnostic,
can't help to cry...undersanding freedom is something
earned.

For clean brooks and forest...and lobster with
claws...
and canyons where gawds still live...

For whales breaching high tides...and we got our
sturgeons..used have what was considered the FINEST
caviar!

For Jewish delis and Italian immigrants who gave the
world a proper sandwhich (gawd damn those Americans
for thinking Jewish food was anything was EASTERN
EUROPEAN)

For transparency and gay rights, and environmentalist
movement, for the most diverse work force, the most
powerful women and people of color, for best
universities and most generous nation (that's gov't
and private folk) for a sign, he said, there was
globing warming...

For religious freedom and a gov't that is ACUTALLY
integrated - unliked everyone else...for a man who'd
press his hand on Jefferson's Islamic bible

For a bill of rights, and TOM PAINE...Tom Paine, who
the French'd jail..and who'd create Anglo-American
Liberalism

There aint nothin better, sorry George B., nothin
better...and I can say this drinking coffee and not
tea, although we created the tea bag, and dropped
boxes of it into the sea...no, we aint British, can't
claim that pose....but we a republic - at least!

And for Pan-Africanism....Ali, damn if you don't
know...and even those Irish who lynched our brothers!
- and who later sent home money for the IRA. Where is
W.E.B?

It is so easy to hate, what is so beutiful...so easy
to scorn, what aint perfect...but I love it...ew!

I love Bruce Lee and Rep. Matsui, that fella from
Hungry, that homo named Franks - that I can march on
Washingston - no guns - and claim to hate my country's
leader - nowhere ELSE - and I HAVE SEEN NEARLY ELSE!
Do you know Inouye? (How about that regiment most
decorated during WWII - family's in detention camps!)

Soldiers sing songs cussing GOd, but I don't want to
cry.

Look forward to seeing you,

Six days ago I started:

http://www.logolalia.com/arspoetica/

This is a themed blog (ars poetica, or, poems about poetry) that will
lead to a print anthology.

I invited five of my favorite poets to send me an ars poetica they'd
written along with the names and email addresses of five other
poets. I then invited those twenty-five poets to do the same. I then
invited those hundred and twenty-five poets to do the same. I then
invited...you get the picture.

Every poem submitted will appear on the website, one per day, and be
archived by author and date.

The print anthology will be published by Paper Kite Press when the
editors (Jennifer Hill-Kaucher and Dan Waber) determine that a book
length collection of the very best of these poems exists, which, at a
poem a day, is likely to take a year or more.

Submissions are by connected chain of invitation only, this is NOT an
open call, but anyone interested in reading poems about poetry is
certainly invited to come visit every day for their daily dose.

The ripples are spreading outward in the most delightful ways. Keep
watching and see.

Regards,
Dan

Most of the originals I have seen are in color.  Scrimshaw Press did a book
of Patchen reproductions in the late sixties or early seventies. It is
possible that Chronicle books did a reprint.

A little "Abebooks" (is it) research should bring up the title.

It's wonderful stuff - often - playful.

Patchen also typeset many of his early books. He liked to play with the page
- typefaces, colors, etc. (Sleepers Awake, for example) It's too bad, if I
 recollect correctly, that his crippling back issues darkened his
temperament and took him out of the public loop in the fifties and early
sixties - when publciations by New Directions and City Lights could have
brought him more attention (Ferlinghetti, in part, took of on Patchen's
lyric, goofy  surreal side, as did Richard Brautigan).

I have not looked at the prose work in a long time. I suspect Patchen is
another sad case of getting thrown down the "Depression writer" sink hole
that New Critics et al were elated to dig. Does anybody write about him??

Patchen did a huge number of color works.  All you have to do is search the
web and you'll find a great deal--also there are book editions of a great
many of the colors--some were originally printed in color----check yr
library.  Two sites I can think of off the top of my head with color
paintings/poems by Patchen are Light and Dust and the Kenneth Patchen Home
Site.  Each one of these has twelve color pieces.  And that's just for
starters. The color works are beautiful!

Perhaps more a book of paintings with words, which may be termed vis-po,
Patchen's _What Shall We Do Without Us? The Voice and Vision of Kenneth
Patchen_ was publiched my Sierra Club books of San Francisco in 1984. I =
have
a paperback edition and it is passing beautiful.

Most of the originals I have seen are in color.  Scrimshaw Press did a =
book
of Patchen reproductions in the late sixties or early seventies. It is
possible that Chronicle books did a reprint.

A little "Abebooks" (is it) research should bring up the title.

It's wonderful stuff - often - playful.

Patchen also typeset many of his early books. He liked to play with the =
page
- typefaces, colors, etc. (Sleepers Awake, for example) It's too bad, if =
I
 recollect correctly, that his crippling back issues darkened his
temperament and took him out of the public loop in the fifties and early
sixties - when publciations by New Directions and City Lights could have
brought him more attention (Ferlinghetti, in part, took of on Patchen's
lyric, goofy  surreal side, as did Richard Brautigan).

I have not looked at the prose work in a long time. I suspect Patchen is
another sad case of getting thrown down the "Depression writer" sink =
hole
that New Critics et al were elated to dig. Does anybody write about =
him??

Thanks to all for sending in work for upcoming issue 06 at the
listenlight poetry journal <http://listenlight.net/06>.  The theme is,
if you will, "putting out the fire on the water..."  We're still looking
for more good visual & textual work, experimental or not.  In fact, this
editor appreciates a good narrative poem now and then.  Ghosts, aliens,
zombies, flowers --- all of it.  Anyone here doing anything like that?
I'm interested.

Best wishes for the new year,
Jesse Crockett

"What shall we do without us" published by Sierra Books. As DBC mentioned the Patchen website has a calendar. There is a set of color postcards made but I am not sure if they had much distribution.

  My memory is faulty but the paintings are all archived in one primary spot, a bit before Miriam died we were making arrangements, for some reason I think it was SFSU, but things became unstable in terms of rights and whatnot and I dropped it as I have experienced that nightmare once already. Larry Smith would know.

  To mention, tho there are no color photos in it, a new journal by Doug Manson that is all about Patchen called Celery Flute is well worth a look, they are in Buffalo--

It is begging the question in the sense that I am assuming that we want
people to =B3buy=B2 poetry.
Also that there appears a contradiction there in that poetry doesn=B9t try to
sell anything, but that we want people to buy it.
Perhaps I am using the phrase incorrectly.

I mean that when we perform to a room of people, they should be
enthusiastic, as opposed to  indifferent, or even turned off to the point o=
f
wishing it were over.


They should =B3believe=B2 and be moved somehow and want to buy it, and it=B9s our
obligation as performers to deliver, or at least work towards this.

Present strong work, accessible, try and reach the audience, talk to them i=
n
some way, acknowledge their presence & role for example.

Mime-Version: 1.0 (Apple Message framework v624)
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Since late 2000, Factory School has kept a digital audio archive online
for teachers and students who wanted to access poetry and literature
informally without download ability. I mean, the files were there to be
downloaded, but not everyone figured out how to get them. A few years
ago a double-cd was offered containing all of the literary audio stored
on the Factory School site--many many hours of listening--hundreds of
files. In a gradual redeployment of resources at Factory School, last
year the links to the site were removed. Only people who bookmarked the
site or asked were given the link, and mostly those who asked were
educators.

Since its founding a couple of years ago, all of the files for which
permission could be and was given were integrated into the PennSound
project at the University of Pennsylvania. What remained distinct about
the Factory School collection was the un-authorized nature of many of
our recordings--and, I suppose, the impish delight we took in flouting
the law.  However, this past December, due to a variety of factors, the
server which stored that audio is no longer extant, and without
financial support we will be unable to make that component of the
Factory School project available again.

While we are sorry if this causes any inconveniences, this is purely a
financial decision. The audio was never to be considered to be a public
accommodation, but rather an instructional aid within a very particular
learning situation--but we realize that many people had a use for it.
Indeed, while the logs showed that many people retained access even
after the links were removed, and that many people from many countries
still visited our site. The last announcements over the last couple
years predicting the end of this virtual library, drew diminishing
response.

But if there is someone out there who needs this collection, and is
willing to make a contribution to Factory School (ahem), we'll be happy
to send out the disks. Sales of FS books totaling more than $50 will
include the disks gratis, but only when requested by the person
ordering.

Happy New Year to everyone in Poeticsland!

On Thursday, just after noon, the Tufts historian Felipe Fernandez-
Armesto was arrested by Atlanta police as he crossed the middle of
the street between the Hilton and Hyatt hotels. After being thrown on
the ground and handcuffed, the former Oxford don was formally
arrested, his hands cuffed behind his back. Several policemen pressed
hard on his neck and chest, leaving the mild-mannered scholar, who's
never gotten so much as a parking ticket, bruised and in pain. He was
then taken to the city detention center along with other accused
felons and thrown into a filthy jail cell filled with prisoners. He
remained incarcerated for eight hours. Officials demanded bail of
over a thousand dollars. To come up up with the money Fernandez-
Armesto, the author of nineteen books, had to make an arrangement
with a bail bondsman. In court even the prosecutors seemed
embarrassed by the incident, which got out of hand when Fernandez-
Armesto requested to see the policeman's identification (the
policeman was wearing a bomber jacket; to Fernandez-Armesto, a
foreigner unfamiliar with American culture, the officer did not look
like an officer). The prosecutors asked the professor to plead nolo
contendere. He refused, concerned that the stain on his record might
put his green card status in jeopardy. Officials finally agreed to
drop all charges. The judge expressed his approval. The professor
says he has no plans to sue. But the AHA council is considering
lodging a complaint with the city.

I am going to Quebec later this year to read at a festival and I was
thinking of visiting the USA as well, having never been there. Maybe
it's not a good idea.

Subject: blurb for our upcoming show at Millennium in New York

(date to be announced)

Crepuscle (Twilight) explores the exigencies of dance, eroticism, cultural
restriction, and arousal; it was edited from over a dozen segments in
Geneva. The work tenders the null-point of language, a point where words
stutter, where the body takes over, where cultural tropes are transformed
and lost. It's the deliberate creation of repressed memories. It challenges
the conventions of dance - turning dance inside-out. For the
three of us, it's the culmination of an erotic element in our work that has
all been lost in contemporary culture. Crepuscle rides the muscle of the
body and jouissance, opening a territory which remains virtual, haunting.

A number of short works with Foofwa, shot in Geneva, Gruyeres, and the
Aletsch Glacier in the Swiss Alps, will also be shown.

Jim,

To be "a man of a thousand voices" sounds so much better than to be the "man
of a thousand faces." Do you remember the movie in which James Kagney plays
Lon Cheney's father?

Then there was "Land of a Thousand Dances"--first done by Cannibal and the
Headhunters--a big hit for Wilson Pickett--
(There's "Land of a Thousand Dunces" a compilation of truly stupid Sxities
frat rock songs, too--)

i met Mel Blanc at the 1978 Zagreb International Festival of Animation--even
more amazing was the woman who did the Roadrunner (as i recall;--she gave
great final night speech in a myriad voices all accompanied by vodka shots)
and others--and people from various countries who could do it seemed about
two thousand voices--Warren Fishbach who was the last to do the voice of
Popeye and also many Disney characters lives here in Milwaukee--very good
story teller about Hollywood days and years in the air force flying sorties
over Germany--mimics movie stars and generals alike--

Lon Chaney made some incredible films--a great contortionist--not only with
his face--played many roles where he became armless, or legless--he and Tod
Browning made some masterpieces of mutilated bodies and souls together--

Hi
Selling out?I would have thought that this was so far down the list of
poetry's concerns as to be invisible. Almost no-one can make a living
directly from writing poetry, however much they try to "sell out".Most small
UK mags won't even pay you. It follows that if you want to make a living out
of writing then you'll write something else.Ourselves and respected peers
and mentors are the audience.So it's down to our own taste in poetry, in
mentors and in peers.

 >>Ho ho. Have you been to Guantanamo lately?

No. Have you?

_____

So much depends on how one tells a story:


The former Oxford don was thrown on the ground, and several
policemen pressed hard on his neck and chest.

His hands cuffed behind his back, Fernandez-Armesto felt the
  warmth of the gritty sidewalk and the sweaty odor of the
police on top of him. He felt their calloused hands
searching his body. "Plead no contest" the police breathed
in his ear, "jaywalker!" A tongue trailed against his face.

Seized with desire, Felipe Fernandez-Armesto murmured
"yes, oh yes," as the tall uniformed officers pressed their
hard bodies against his yielding flesh. Not since Oxford had
the scholar felt such joy and release in the company of men.

The professor says he has no plans to sue.

The originals of Patchen's painted poems are in the Special Collections,=
 University of California at Santa Cruz. Rita Bottoms was the Head of Sp=
ecial Collections until her retirement in 2003. I'm not sure who is in c=
harge now. I met Rita (and Miriam Patchen) at the Kenneth Patchen Festiv=
al in Warren Ohio in 1990. I think Miriam donated or sold everything of =
Patchen's that she had, including the painted poems,  to the UCSC librar=
y.
There's lots besides Patchen's work at UCSC. To find out more about what=
 Bottons brought to this collection see:

The WordTemple Poetry Series will celebrate the beginning of its second year
on Friday, January 12, 2007 by featuring Michael McClure and Michael
Rothenberg.  Refreshments will be provided as part of the celebration so
come early, and please spread the word!


Michael McClure and Michael Rothenberg
Friday, January 12, 2007 - 7 p.m.
Copperfield's Books, 2316 Montgomery Dr., Santa Rosa


Michael McClure is famous for his dynamic poetry performances. Author of
Rain Mirror, Touching the Edge: Dharma Devotions from the Hummingbird
Sangha, and Huge Dreams, McClure has given hundreds of readings from the
legendary Six Gallery in San Francisco (with Allen Ginsberg) to the Library
of Congress. Recently, McClure joined with composer Terry Riley to create a
CD titled I Like Your Eyes Liberty, a stunning exploration of music and
voice. A musician and playwright, as well as a poet -- McClure's songs
include "Mercedes Benz" popularized by Janis Joplin.


Michael Rothenberg's books include The Paris Journals, Monk Daddy and
Unhurried Vision. He is editor and publisher of Big Bridge
(www.bigbridge.org), the editor of Overtime, Selected Poems by Philip
Whalen, As Ever, Selected Poems by Joanne Kyger, and David's Copy, Selected
Poems by David Meltzer.  Rothenberg's readings are stunning for their wide
range of experience and emotion.  David Meltzer calls Unhurried Vision a
"deeply stirred & stirring affirmation of poetry's centrality in realizing
mundane & profound instances in the everyday extraordinary."

Good going. This is a public forum. You've turned a distressing news
story into libel against the victim. In a just world Fernandez would
hear of this and sue your ass.

It might be smart to remember that people aren't fictions to be
played with as we wish.

Cheery of you to write that, Mr. Grouchy Pants. In a just
world, you'd have a sense of humor.





Maybe Wallace Stevens' estate will sue me for this
child-molesting reworking of "The Idea of Order at Key West"?


Ramon Fernandez

The lights by the harbor tremble my tears.
Soon sand feels my shoes for clouds,
the sunrise a red flare of hangover,
the gibelike whistle of dawn gulls
huffing swells of salt whiskey lulls.

My tooth-cut tongue ingests wan aerosol,
the mirage of her aria like a slap of surf,
a tide hauled back from Key West, Florida
on a warm night sixty-five boat years ago.

That woman was no mirage.

Hangovers belong to everyone with history.
Also the motive to clasp too hard or
end gripping in a clumsy tumble.

"Wacked. Club fungus. Rocky bald heads."

She called us that because she wasn't born yet.
Teenagers on special K stare down at
two hundred dollar sneakers and know.
The false tide of whiskey crashing red
as he talked motif and imagination.
We loved each other like two land mines.
He became a woman and wanted to live forever.
Small Ramon did nothing but hold his breath
so that inelegant ages off, the ruse will show
and mortal gods rush to shut the books of yearning.
I'll be registered as the nobody in particular, the tell-me.

varium et mutabile semper femina

As the ocean ignites the lanterns in its chambers,
As the boats knock together like lonely drunks,
As she sings to the sea that made her whole thing.

Ah, Mister Yost has returned, brandishing his diploma from
kindergarten against all humorless challengers, and compounding his
puerility with an appropriately infantile parody!  "But," he whines,
sucking on his lollipop (or is it a billyclub?), "why can't I make fun
of some guy with a silly Spanish-type foreign name?  It's my right as
a Murican!  Hey, wanna see my Abu Ghraib ode, 'In Praise of Charles
Graner'?  Dana Gioia thought it was like so cool and wants to give me
an NEA grant.  And really, like, it's a joke anyway -- like Abu Ghraib
was, you know, frat-boy stuff, the kind of thing I wanna do when I
maybe like grow up or something."

Do I really have to explain the difference? Both ethics and the law
differentiate between rubbing a private citizen's face in the mud and
artistic satire. The Stevens estate couldn't even sue successfully
for violation of copyright, because it's a satire. A public figure
also loses a lot of protection--the persona can be satirized,
attacked, and even to an extent lied about. But no one is allowed to
assert in print that for instance you get a sexual kick out of being assaulted.

It's really not a question of whether I think what you did is funny
(I don't, but tastes differ--some people may think that using rough
homoerotic sex as a way to make fun of a stranger is a real hoot).
It's a question of whether your victim thinks it's funny.

That's my second, therefore last, post for the day.

Mark

It's difficult to think of anything more thigh-slappingly hilarious

I
must ask if you recognise that you are performing repeated antisocial act=
s
that amount to 'cyber-rape'"

That someone can consider themselves as having been raped in a literary
context shows the workings of a powerful imagination.=20

The 7C Amergin poem and touchstone text of the Irish tradition, which
explains exactly what the poetic gift is, how it works and which heads th=

"The joy of fitting poetic frenzy," which comes when the mind is "grindin=

away for the fair nuts on the nine hazels at the Well of Seigas."  This i=
s
analogous to the mental fizz one has when in the throes of composition.=20=


The Well of Seigas is the mythological source of poetry in the Irish
tradition, ringed by nine hazel trees, whose nuts are a bit like the frui=
t
in the garden of Eden, but guiltless and shame-free. It is a poetical myt=
h
with no reptilian anti-Christ whispering Armageddon or eternal spiritual
torture by burning, a total absence of Adam and a much more sophisticated=

Eve, in the form of Fin, who finds Nirvanic wisdom in a Salmon rather tha=
n
terminal depression and eternal shame in a Granny Smith.=20

The "knowing ones" refer to Irish poets in the bardic tradition, which
evolved in an unbroken line and ran from pre-Jesus era druids to early 17=
C

ed
during the scorched earth and famine policies implemented by Elizabethan
courtiers carving out their careers in those brutal times.

It lists the numerous grammatical rules and meters, which evolved in the =
-
at that point in the 14C - 900 year old written tradition of his country.=

The meters are probably the most complex in any written tradition on eart=

and the whole subject is fascinating - and mostly unknown - to the seriou=
s
linguistic bores of this world.

It is only now with the advent of the net that the texts are being widely=

Has anyone read "Kenneth Patchen: Rebel Poet in America" by Larry R.
Smith ...   It's my time of the year to read literary biographies &
I've been wanting to read this.  I see that a review on Amazon calls
it a "self-published socio-political diatribe" among other things.

  I read the Rebel Poet in America book, it is excellent, great info, well researched, but the number of mistakes, mispellings, grammar and so on really made me blush with embarassment; it was difficult to read through.

By the way, Rita Bottoms was who I was thinking of and, George is right, not all the paintings are at Santa Cruz.

I am hesitant to point out the obvious here, but for an example of "begging

I have been conscious of this phrase and its misuse since a long diatribe by
one of my professors. He referred to its misuse as one of his pet peeves. It
seems people often say "begs the question" when they mean "raises the

Alison ecrit: It's difficult to think of anything more
thigh-slappingly hilarious than rape. Oh, of course; raping
children.


Keep your thighs slap-free. That poem wasn't meant to be
funny. Just an extreme defamiliarization posted for its
potential to be offensive to Wallace Stevens mavens.

Compounding your example, maybe "funny" is a leper raping
dead children and eating them during a nuclear war? Or maybe
"funny" obliges serious standards to avoid disturbing
people's finer feelings ... whether they have them or not?
De gustibus.

People are people -- you, me, the purportedly victimized
scholar, all of us the center of the universe trapped in our
skin suits. Words about people are stories, and the truth
about stories, as Proust maintained, is a point of view.

I advanced this notion in a vulgar and offensive way. My
apologies to all who were offended ... whether they should
have been or not.

Chastened,
Eric

The Moral Equivalent of War

If you are in the Bay Area this weekend, this is a great, intense small show
of a century of anti-war, pro-peace documents and public works/actions that
emerged from or in relation to William James' famous essay, one that was
delivered as a talk at Stanford University 100 years ago this month.
In addition to much else, the exhibit is a great demonstration of the
various historic uses of Typography in the service of a political and moral
conviction. The show is spare - not overcrowded with documents - and to the
point.  In the context of much of  today's  'sell-sell' gallery shows, the
exhibit is also a refreshing experience in re-contextualizing the public
power and function of language and image.  And, needless to say, a real
counterpoint to the current Bush madness.


The Bonnifont Gallery
946a Greenwich St.
San Francisco CA 94113

Saturday and Sunday
2 - 5

The show formally closes this Sunday - but will remain open by appointment
until January 26.
Call the Curator, Hope Kingsley, (510-845-7629) to set up a special visit,
if necessary.

does anyone have any advice about how to teach or learn about rhythm
and meter? i tried all of that scansion business, pacing up and down
in front of the class beating out rhythms and such and it was quite a
disaster last year so i'm hoping to find something better--and ways
for myself to learn more about this too. i've read and read about the
subject, but does anyone have any good activities around the ideas of
rhythm and poetry?

This story in today's San Francisco Chronicle may not be about poetry, but
it is about language; an amazing  story of Spocko, a small blogger's success
in short circuiting corporate advertising in support of local racist, and
hate mongering talk show radio hosts on the local conservative KSFO radio
station.
The tactic is simple:
"For the past year, Spocko has been e-mailing advertisers of KSFO-AM with
audio clips from its shows and asking sponsors to examine what they're
supporting. Some sponsors have pulled their ads, after hearing clips like
one of KSFO's Lee Rodgers suggesting that a protester be "stomped to death
right there. Just stomp their bleeping guts out."...

As a consequence, the station has been losing advertisings. And, of course,
KSFO is threatening Spocko with legal action, etc., etc. - saying that
Spocko is interfering with Freedom of Speech! ACLU is stepping in to support
Spocko, etc.

Anyway, off to an instant demonstration at the SF City Hall in response to
King George's 'my way or screw you' speech last night!  If you cannot go
today, Saturday promises more across the country.

How much blood can cross this guy's hands?

This is my kind of media terrorism.  As for Bush, let's recall
Macbeth's lines (spoken not long before he gets his comeuppance): "I
am in blood / Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more /
Returning were as tedious as go o'er."

Don't some taping devices have a needle that goes into the red when the
voice is being picked up too loudly? Maybe seeing the needle jump on
accented syllable will help them hear the kettle drum beneath our =
language.

I scan anything on the board. Including the students' complaints that =
they
can't hear it.=20

"I can't hear it"
- - / -=20

Say aloud "Don't put the emphasis on the wrong syllable" by =
mispronouncing
"emphasis" and "syllable" (putting the emphasis on the second syllables) =
and
see how many understand you. Most will, but they'll see the joke. That =
if
you switch emphases, even with the sounds being exactly the same, the =
words
becomes almost unrecognizable.

Of course they can't use a dictionary for multi-syllable words, but you =
can
switch the emphases of these as well to show them.

I share the frustration. Some won't hear it. Most will. (That's with =
college
freshmen.)

John,

Paul Auster's book about becoming a writer ("Making It"?) starts with
Auster's intention to make his living out of his poetry. By the end of the
book, he "makes it" alright, but first as I think detevive novelist, and
then he goes from there. Auster never confronts this subtle transformation
his plan undergoes.

Ciao,

Murat

This is very weird.  The UU church just popped me an email and  moveon.org
sent an email to tell me that there will be an anti-war protest right  here in
Minnetonka at 6 p.m.  (This is a favorite stomping grounds for  Bush/Cheney,
who close the freeway when they're headed out to the Lake.)   We'll be meeting
at Lakewinds, a food-coop, also right here in Minnetonka.   You know I was
complaining so much a few months ago, but now that I have a few  dollars in my
pocket, I can actually go to the food coop and hold my head  up.  And now go to a
peace rally.  I can't believe this.  It made  me cry to think I can go to a
peace rally in my hometown.

Has anyone who would like to discuss it read Orwell's Down and Out in  Paris
and London?  I've just started it; it's terrific -- anecdotal  and based on
tiny portraits of people who live in the ghetto and their  poverty.

why is is so weird that there's a peace rally in mpls? this area has
a strong history of politically progressive (if socially
conservative) populism.  i read down n out in p and l in high school
and absolutely adored it, but the only thing i remember clearly is
about the parisian restaurant workers wringing out a dirty dishcloth
(or was it a rag they used to wipe the floor) into a really fancy
soup before serving the bourgeois clientele! that's stayed with me,
for better or worse. cheers, homegirl!

no doubt i'll catch all sorts of flack for this, but being of the (it seems minority in poetry circles) opinion that there are multiple levels of stress in English, I think part of the problem a lot of people have in hearing meter is that when you tell them all syllables are stressed or unstressed and they get confused because you then have to tell them that syllables that sound stressed to them are actually unstressed, and that syllables that don't sound as stressed as others actually are stressed.

which is what you get when you cling to archaic notions about the sounds of language that are borrowed from largely dead languages like Ancient Greek, Latin, and Anglo Saxon. I just don't see much purpose in trying to shoe-horn as complex a language as English into such a simple rhythmic framework as is offered by the traditional foot and two value scansion of classical prosody.

Well, not to be a gadfly -- or, why not?  -- but if we're discussing
prosody, and students' failure accordingly -- then we might as well
talk about the fact that so many students can't read *prose*.

Now this may or may not be anything new.  But my approach to
classrooms sonics is pretty simple:  we read as much as we can ALOUD.
Yep, it takes up time.  Occasionally I bring in a tape recorder --
depends on how anal I feel.

But I've been surprised, dismayed, and not-so-surprised at how many
students can't make their way through the relatively pedestrian
rhythms of a relatively pedestrian sentence.  There was a time, to
which I'd wish not to return, when entire classes recited passages
orally (prose, poetry, what have you) in unison.  At least that
activity yoked meaning both to pronunciation and enunciation, and
rhythm came along for the ride (at least), in that emphasis IS, to a
large extent, meaning.

There's a more theoretical matter here, having to do with performance
(see e.g. McGann's new book).  I'll leave that one alone for now.  I
think it a good idea, at any rate, to devote class time to aural
performance (incl., btw, reciting from memory).

Best,

Joe

Dears,

It=B9s a new year and with that comes a new hard drive. Like many good things=
,
one of our very important office computer hard drives died a quick and
sudden death on New Year=B9s Eve. Thusly, any and all emails sent to the
info@poetryproject.com account between 12/31/06 and yesterday were received
today, and we apologize for the major delay in informative communication.

Please join us for three terrific upcoming nights, details follow below.

Also, scroll down for descriptions of the soon-to-commence Spring Workshops=
.
This season=B9s classes will be led by Dgls. Rothschild, Akilah Oliver, Joann=
a
Fuhrman and Thomas Savage. We are currently accepting reservations, and the
classes will begin the second week of February.

Thanks to all who supported the New Year=B9s Day Marathon in every capacity;
we had a great time, =8Ctwas a roaring success, and we & the hard drive feel
fully recovered.

Love,

The Poetry Project

This is the Bike Ride to Work: Prose Poems & Super 8: Stephanie Gray
=20
An evening of poems and super 8 shorts. Poems read live with films and a
keyboard. Work will tackle Joan of Arc, Buffalo, Metallica, grain elevators=
,
a bike ride to work, and will include a film set to the words of Eileen
Myles' "School of Fish." Stephanie Gray is a poet and an experimental
filmmaker whose films often incorporate poetry. Her poems have appeared in
the on-line poetry journals Can We Have Our Ball Back?, Unpleasant Event
Schedule, and Lodestar Quarterly. She has a book forthcoming, of mostly
prose poems, entitled Heart Stoner Bingo from Straw Gate Books in 2007. Her
film Dear Joan (about Joan of Arc) which has a poem voiceover, has screened
internationally, and is distributed by Frameline Lesbian & Gay Film
Distribution. Her super 8 films often deal with themes of the city, pop
culture, class, queerness, feminism and hearing loss, but not always in tha=
t
order or at the same time. Her super 8 films are often hand-processed and
edited in camera. She has received funding from NYFA (in film), NYSCA and
the Experimental Television Center. Her work has been featured in NYC in
one-woman screenings at Millennium Film Workshop and the Mix Fest @
Collective Unconscious. Her films have shown in film festivals and venues
such as Exit Art (NY), Oberhausen (Germany), Viennale (Austria), VIDEOEX
(Switzerland), Cinematexas (Austin), Antimatter (Canada), Chicago
Underground Film Fest, Free Speech TV, Inside Out Lesbian and Gay Film Fest
(Toronto), and Madcat Women=B9s Intl. Film Fest (San Francisco). She has
performed her poetry with films at fests and venues such as Splice This!
Super 8 Film Fest (Toronto) and Squeaky Wheel/Buffalo Media Resources, amon=
g
others. Images from her film Kristy are in the LTTR=B9s (Lesbians To The
Rescue) Fall 2005 issue. Formerly of Buffalo, where she worked at Squeaky
Wheel, a media arts center, she moved to NYC in 2004 and currently works at
Anthology Film Archives.

Spring Workshops at the Poetry Project



The Poetry School Of Poetry =AD  Douglas Rothschild
Tuesdays at 7 Pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 13th

Writing  poetry is difficult; writing good poetry, more difficult still. In
this  workshop, we will focus on exactly what we think is good in a poem &
determine how our senses of aesthetics inform our responses to this
question. Working within our own aesthetic notions we will then begin to
refine our  writing, & help each other to write the best poems that we can.
The workshop  will conduct a number of actual experiments with writing that
will allow us to  step outside the world of id, which wants to keep all the
beautiful words,  & into the artistic self, which understands which pieces
fit & which  belong elsewhere. We will also engage the basic Poetry School
of Poetry premise  that the poet=B9s first job is to learn how to edit. Dgls
N. Rthschld has been  behind the foods table at the New Years Reading more
times than it is worth  mentioning. He has also written a number of
chapbooks, the most ground breaking  entitled The Minor Arcane.  He has
taught what seem to be innumerable college writing classes, and is
currently teaching at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, a CUNY
school.=20


The Visible Unseen: Writing Outside Borders =AD Akilah Oliver
Thursdays at 7 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 15th

Are  poetry and prose virtual realities, simulations of something other, or
the real  thing? Where does the =B3I=B2  live? How many moments exist in  the
moment of the line? What  borders of form are crucial for us to hang on to =
&
which boundaries are  collapsible? In this workshop, we  will explore the
connections and tensions between the visible and the unseen  world/s, not a=
s
dualities or binaries, but as complementary sites of  composition. Through
engagement with text (written and visual), public spaces, the imagination,
dreams and Eros, participants are invited to think of writing as that which
re-imagines the known and the unknown. Though this is a text based workshop=
,
poets, prose writers, and artists from all disciplines are welcome. Reading=
s
include: Giorgio Agamben, Laura Mullen, Whitman, Anne Waldman, Derrida, &
Ben Okri. Akilah Oliver is the  author of the she said dialogues: flesh
memory, An Arriving Guard of Angels, Thusly  Coming to Greet, a(A)gust, &
The Putterer=B9s Notebook. She is faculty at the Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics Summer  Writing Program at Naropa University.


Impurity  Rocks! A Poetry Lab & Workshop =AD Joanna Fuhrman
Fridays at 7 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 16th

The class will focus on  =B3impure=B2 poetry, poetry that employs a mixture of
tones and styles. Special  emphasis will be placed on works that combine
narrative and humor with  linguistic and imagistic disjunction. In-class
exercises and take-home assignments  will touch on issues of scale, space,
sound, genre and wordplay. Time will also  be devoted to reading published
poems as well as in-depth discussions and  critiques of student work. Joann=
a
Fuhrman is the author of three collections of  poetry, Freud in Brooklyn,
Ugh Ugh Ocean and Moraine, all published by Hanging Loose Press. She has
taught poetry  writing at The University of Washington, The Cooper Union
Saturday Outreach  program and in the New York City Public Schools.


Poetry  For The Page, Stage, And Computer Screen =AD Thomas Savage
Saturdays At 12 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 17th

This  course is a writing workshop where students' writing is the main
focus.  Also used as inspiration and writing prompts will be samples of wor=
k
by  writers from The Beats, Black Mountain poets, The New York School (all
generations), Language Poetry, Poets Theater, Pablo Neruda, and works being
published today online, among other sources. Practices will include  readin=
g
as well as writing assignments and, in a great Poetry Project tradition,
in-class writing. Thomas Savage has written eight published books of  poems
including most recently Bamiyan Poems, Brain Surgery Poems and Political
Conditions/Physical  States. His poems  have appeared in many print and
online venues including The New York Times, Hanging Loose, Rattapallax, Big
Bridge, Black Box, and regularly on the Wryting-L website. He has taught
poetry  workshops at The Poetry Project and Tribes Gallery.

Me, I'd have a good look at some drama exercises for children (there
are some good British books in particular) and adapt the rhythmical or
textual ones to working with poems.  It all depends on the age of the
children, too. With young ones I'd start with Dr Seuss.

All the best

Alison

Who is the sell out?=20

Pound lived off the benifices of women he used.
Williams worked as a doctor.
Neruda was a Diplomat
Stein lived off her money and Alice

As far as I can see one of the only poets in the past century who did =

John,

Paul Auster's book about becoming a writer ("Making It"?) starts with
Auster's intention to make his living out of his poetry. By the end of =
the
book, he "makes it" alright, but first as I think detevive novelist, and
then he goes from there. Auster never confronts this subtle =
transformation
his plan undergoes.

Ciao,

Are you tired of reading the same old recuring asian american poets?
Well, here's a poetry special issue of Mipoesias dedicated to the new,

I've never heard Juliette read ...

But yeah, sorry I rushed off like that last Saturday, my friends were antsy

Yeah.  Them damn Berkeley tree-loving tree-smoking ...

Well I had a really great time with you at dinner!  I thought it was good I

I complete second Jason's point. I think, if one wants to make a metrical
analysis of the sound and stress structure of a language, one has to do it
from within the language itself.

The Irish voice stresses totally different, as the final "A" in "Kavanagh=

final "A" an English voice uses.=20

Anglo-Saxon meter roots in the alliterative one from the 10C onwards.=20

Alliterative meter is therefore the native English language poetic -

So the whole business of scansion in the English language can only ever b=

constructs as their poetic differs from waffler to wavelength professor i=

the sonic arts. Effectively, we make our own theory up from whatever we
discover and believe is relevant or true.

The datum mark of the traditional poetic we decide to agree on is
essentially flawed - as it is a quantitive system of scanning by syllable=

length - the time it takes to say the word - not the stress. It's neither=

fish nor fowl, and the whole premise of there being an easily grasped nat=
ive
blueprint of prosody in modern English language poetry is in effect - a f=
allacy.

I recently read Horace's "Ars Poetica" for the first time and he read lik=
e
Heaney's prose does, straightforward, logical, obviously written by one w=
ho
practices the art. It was then a penny dropped. Aristotle was a talker of=

poetic theory, not a practitioner of verse, so it was no wonder we find h=
im
dense and difficult.=20

Aristotle telling a poet how to write poetry is like us telling a brain
surgeon how to fix stroke patients, but Horace makes sense as he talks fr=
om
experience.

Enthuse the kids and keep our own "shiny armour of moi" for the battles i=

thank you guys, this is great, i did try out that red meter thing on
the computer.

does anyone have any opinions on pinsky's discussion of rhythms being
created out of vowels and constonants? (the consonants being the
things that stop sounds and the vowels being something of a continuous
flow of air at least).

which takes us into olsen's unfurling flow of the line, which takes us
to Olsen and the breath.

are we still talking about rhythm?  can rhythm be discussed separately
from quesitons of rhyme?

what am i missing in there.

and memorize, yes, good, happy to memorize, just tell me what (i
confess i'm as concerned for my own learning as that of my students,
if such a separation can be made).

i'm a bit concerned that tennyson, as lovely as the first lines are:

"break, break, break/against thy cold grey stones/o sea"

if rhthms are copied stanza by stanza will lead to that stilted
rhyming poetry that i fear from my students (and occasionally from
myself). any ideas about how to move from tennyson to free verse?

maybe it's just the wrong poem that i'm starting out with.

maybe dr. seuss really will do it?

hey patrick, yeah,


ok, so why not change the thread to begging the answer,
because i am still wondering what about performing,  who is it for,
for instance the MLA readings, and the posting to this list about how it
might be more fun if we just
showed up and talked to each other.

like at gallery openings when everybody shows up to look at who else is
there, not the art.

what do you think? do you perform? who is it for, you
or the audience?  IF its for them what do you owe them

For me, the public reading of the work is an important test, both of it and myself: Can I really stand behind what I have produced? At one point I stopped writing for several years because of the realization that the work I had just read out was not something I could any longer represent. I don't think I'd have had this realization without the performance experience, unhappy though it was at the time, and I'm happy that I did not produce (finish) anything again until I'd attained a different relation to my writing. (Subsequently, I've been able to change my mind again about some of the work that had earlier disappointed me; I can now see qualities in it I'd lost sight of.)

  As a member of the public, I learn a lot from hearing people read their work. It helps me understand where they're coming from with it. One example: I never really "got" Clark Coolidge until I heard him read. Then I realized he was really a sort of abstract beat poet and it all began to make sense.

While I agree with you that hearing Clark read easily generates a
deeper level of appreciation for the music & voices of his poetry I
have a really hard time thinking of him as abstract or beat except by
association with people like Philip Guston & his drumming with
Serpent Power.

My sympathies are with all of us trying to teach rhythm and meter in the
classroom--especially to first year students.  It's hard to convince them
it's important or relevant as they struggle just to "make sense" of poems
they read.  They somehow see it as separate to the experience of poetry.

With that said, I've found M.H. Abrams' A Glossary of Literary Terms to be
helpful.  Like Wystan, I try to focus on how r & m connect with the meaning
of the poem.  Also, Abrams' brief discussion of rising and falling rhythms
has been enormously helpful.  While students may not be able to scan
precisely, they often can discern whether a line's rhythm is rising or
falling.  To prep them for looking at poems, I use the Stones' "Beast of
Burden" to get them thinking about metrical feet and stress.  Jagger is so
heavy on certain syllables that it's hard to mess up the scansion.  Also,
because the last syllable of "burden" falls, the students can easily connect
what the song's line "means" with where the accent is placed/not placed.
The use of the song gives them confidence to work with poems.  I've actually
gotten some decent student essays on the marriage of meaning and r & m.
Still, it's one of the toughest things I teach.

how about starting w/ eliz bishop--they love her, she's subtle in her
metrics.
read denise levertov's essay on the line break, also I can't remember where
but she says people often mistake Olson's ideas about breath--she claims he
really means when the mind stops that's when the line is broken.
once I asked creeley, well, you break the line here for this, here for this,
here for that, etc--how do you decide where to break the line? he sd,
I dunno. but of course he did know--he intuited it just as levertov cd
articulate the reasons he intuited it.
musicians can talk abt rhythms in poetry w/ great subtlety--bring in some
accomplished musicians
creeley sd he learned how to write from listening to charlie parker--listen
to steve lacy's settings of creeley for a sympatico extrapolation
stein is great for rhythmic changes

Clark was way after the beats and was reading other stuff like the author
of the Tennis Court Oath and Creeley; a lot of that stuff he was working
on at Brown U w/ Joglars and then in Cambridge; I lived with him and Aram
Saroyan for a short time at that point. It wasn't beat althogh the place
had its doors kicked in before we were there by cops looking for drugs.

Some people are performers and some are not. There are many musicians
who write songs but never perform. Maybe it's the same for poetry. I
believe most times performers perform for their own pleasure, but if
the audience likes it, everybody's happy. Just to think that you have
something others should hear takes a massive ego (one of the great
lessons of the Internet). I suppose the audience will confirm or
disprove that.

Cralan, I've seen the clips of your readings on your site, and
obviously you're an engaging and comfortable performer. How do your
feelings as a performer compare/contrast with your feelings as a
member of an audience?

I just had the opposite experience.  Until recently, I lacked a  computer

lot of that then started making some of my own at home using Gabcast (a  free
service, free along with blogger).  To my happy amazement, I liked my
work-in-poetry better after I had "performed" some of it.  I, too, had  stopped
writing creatively for a long time (some years while I  reevaluated but from a
despondent position), and I now feel a surge of wanting  to be involved again
especially with writing miniature (flash) poet's  fictions.

Hi Andrew---I'm curious about what you mean about the massive ego in
performance. Could you say more about that?

I agree completely. Thinking of the stresses in our language to be of =
only
two kinds, is to ignore the multiplicity of stress, let alone a sensed
recognition of how they relate to pitch, duration, semantics, etc. But I
still teach freshmen and sophomores the simplistic stress method of =
reading
poetry (cautioning them about its simplicity), finding that many of them
gain some access to a new way of listening and appreciating poetry as =
well
as realizing a bit more of rich complexity and delicacy of their =
language.

I do tell them about people who have used more signs than two to =
indicate
greater gradations of stressed and unstressed syllables.

now that sentence by George has pretty nice rhythm

how about reading it to a class and asking them why anyone would say that.

OR ask them to re-write it so that the rhythm is lousy...that kind of
activity is often enlightening

Good point about Levertov. I learned so much from her early on that, in a subtler way, I still depend on.
  I don't think anyone has mentioned this but for traditional metrical verse, I remember Paul Fussell's "Poetic Meter and Poetic Form" as useful. After thirty years, for some reason I still remember one line from it: something like, "Just one of the passing infelicities in Paradise Lost would sink a sonnet."

Ruth Lepson <ruthlepson@COMCAST.NET> wrote:
  how about starting w/ eliz bishop--they love her, she's subtle in her

read denise levertov's essay on the line break, also I can't remember where
but she says people often mistake Olson's ideas about breath--she claims he
really means when the mind stops that's when the line is broken.
once I asked creeley, well, you break the line here for this, here for this,
here for that, etc--how do you decide where to break the line? he sd,
I dunno. but of course he did know--he intuited it just as levertov cd
articulate the reasons he intuited it.
musicians can talk abt rhythms in poetry w/ great subtlety--bring in some
accomplished musicians
creeley sd he learned how to write from listening to charlie parker--listen
to steve lacy's settings of creeley for a sympatico extrapolation
stein is great for rhythmic changes

Dear Stephen Vincent,

thanks for the information about the art exhibit of the moral equivalent of war.  If you write anything about it, or see anything written up about it, or images online, I'd love to know more.  James' argument in "The Moral Equivalent" is smart and canonical reading for peace studies...

>>Who is the sell out?

The thread conflates at least three senses of "sell out."
The first sense of "sell out" is of someone who puts money
before personal integrity. The second sense of "sell out,"
as it seems to be used here, is of a poet who earns a living
from something other than poetry. The third sense of "sell
out" used here is of a poet who writes with an audience in
mind rather than following the inner directives of his or
her art.

I'd argue that only the first sense of "sell out" has any
real value.

The second sense of "sell out" is not only childishly
egotistical, but also in bad faith. In many cases, the user
probably requires therapy rather than a philosophical
refutation.

The third sense of "sell out" falsely assumes that art is
all expression and no communication. We are social mammals.
Our language is inherited from others. Our texts only live
when read by others. The very nature of our brain chemistry
is determined by the presence of or absence of other social
mammals of our species. Expression, for us, only exists in a
social context that presumes communication.

Is Richard Wilbur a "sell out" because his poetry is
accessible? Hardly. Was James Joyce shunning "selling out"
when writing the obscure prose-poetry of _Finnegans Wake_?
No, he clearly had readers in mind.

I think Pinsky's Sounds of Poetry is a really good book, even though it is like most of his critical writing in that it is completely wrong about almost everything. I think it's pretty clear that in English, rhythm is created by stress on syllables, just like in japanese it's created by morae and in ancient Greek it's created by syllable length. Obviously in all languages there's an interplay, syllable length affects affects stress in English and mora in Japanese, and around and around, but I think it's still an oversimplification to talk about consonants as stops the way pinsky does. What to make of dipthongs and tripthongs? what does that mean for soft consonants like n or m? What about double consonants? what about glottal stops that don't even appear as written characters in English?

I don't think it's conventional wisdom. I mean, it should be as the fact that there are multiple levels of stress seems completely obvious to me. But everytime i mention that traditional scansion doesn't make sense in English a bunch of new formalists seem to be lying in wait to tell me how completely wrong i am and what a terrible person i am for daring to challenge the notion that iambic pentameter is the most natural way in the world to write English languge poetry.

Eireene,when it comes to teaching prosody in writing courses (or contemporary literature courses),   the main question concerns sounds,  the hearing of them, the shapes they take and what bearing they have on meaning. Some responses to that question might involve learning about hearing meters and scaning lines, but there's no necessity at all.

I just don't see much purpose in trying to shoe-horn as complex a language as English into such a simple rhythmic framework as is offered by the traditional foot and two value scansion of classical prosody.

Aryanil Mukherjee asked me to forward this news.... Chris



Binoy Majumdar (1934-2006), an Indian poet (Bengali), recently passed =20=

away. Binoy was a brilliant, eccentric, obscure and controversial =20
poet whose life and work await chapters of penetrating research. =20
Binoy is an extremely rare poet =96 it is hard to find a parallel in =20
the western hemisphere. The intense purity with which geometry, =20
mathematics, science and logistics fill the bone-marrow of his =20
poetry, distinguises his rare genre. Despite being a fine and =20
talented engineer, a brilliant, innovative mathematician and an even =20
more brilliant poet, Binoy led a rather distraught and disoriented =20
life of extreme poverty. Failed by one-sided love [for Gayatri =20
Chakraborty (later Spivak)], he lost his mental composure and =20
attempted suicide several times in his life. At times, he would turn =20
violently schizophrenic. In the 1990s, the state government of West =20
Bengal, upon request from fellow poets, provided some support. It =20
didn't restore his physical and mental health. However, during his =20
stay at the state-run hospital, he wrote a book -"haaspaataale lekhaa =20=

kabitaaguchchha' (Hospital Poems) which won him the prestigious =20
national poetry award (Sahitya Academy Purashhkaar). Today, Binoy has =20=

a huge following among poets three or four decades younger.

Featured Poet: Hollice Danielle
who says:
I have been writing since I was very young
And poetry is just something ingrained in my nature
Not a way of capturing the abstracts of life and emotion
but rather running words in parallel and in comparison
Somehow making sense without out definitives
To be honest...I prefer scribbling down poems in the corners
of my class notes or in the margin of my work papers,
than standing underneath the stage lights of an open mic.
But I suppose you can't merely keep shoving poetry
in a drawer to yellow away the rest of your life
When I think of myself as a poet
It's not like walking around with "Poet" stamped on my forehead
or prose mystically unraveling from my fingertips like threads from my=20=

sleeve
But just a quiet inner voice....
Like those scribbles in the margin of my class notes
And if someone flipping through
the pages of my existence happens upon those little side lines
and it resonates back within them

And a brief poem :

=93Universal Hymn=94

god drinks
death-black martinis
tonight
the moon
is his only
ice cube

Hello, Paul.

Here's hoping that all is more than well with you and yours.
Happy New Year!

I'm planning on sending you some new work soon.

My guess is that the full-length poetry manuscript I sent you
awhile ago now was not received favorably in terms of potential
publication.  So it goes...

In any case, cheers, and continue your fine and important work!

All Best,

Being hacked by pooch humpers and loving it.
  http://www.secrettechnology.com/poochlove/doggy.html

  As an artist I’ve made a breakthrough, of sorts. After having one of my little used art sites hacked then littered with strange codes, my subsequent clumsy “investigation” uncovered my rarely updated domain was listed as one of the top sites for such glorious search strings as Horsey, Beasty, Doggy humping/smexing/fudging (and other fun hobbies). While I initially felt violated and angry, I decided to use their code and google work against them, and I could just taste (maybe not taste) a new sticky fingered and dog smelling audience slobberingly waiting to experience my artwork. All 50,000 of the piggy boinkers.

David,

Am Stateside. In Massachusetts, tomorrow in Wisconsin.
Maybe, if you've time, we could meet next week - or
whenever you are free. I know you could teach me lots,
and that's what I'm interested. And I'm being sincere.
Maybe, too, some invites to whatever art projects your
doing!!!

There are some amazing lines there. "Can I smell my own hair?" So who's going to undertake the complete English translation? Any volunteers out there?

A note about recent publications for all of those curious and who do not kn=
ow of the following:

AN EXPERIMENT IN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, poetry in markszine.com
Editor-in-chief and webmaster Deb King; special issue (2006) curated by Car=
la Harryman
web address: http://markszine.com/703/ac/ind.htm

NOTES ON SINCERITY AND IRONY, chapter essay in Stan Brakhage Filmmaker, edi=
ted by David James (Temple University Press 2005)

THIS IS CALLED MOVING: A Poetics of Film, full-length book divided into thr=
ee sections: Sex Talk -on women and film and theory;
Matrix -on work by colleagues, contemporary and historical;
Interrogations -on my work: interviews, articles and transcripts.(Universit=
y of Alabama Press, 2005).

About this book:

"This is a splendidly original collection of essays, comments, and intervie=
ws. Child has published books of poetry (Mob, 1994; Scatter Matrix, 1996) i=
n the same venues as the so-called L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E poets, and her writing s=
tyle sometimes resembles the fragmented but idea-filled paragraphs one find=
s in the prose of Charles Bernstein (A Poetics, 1992) or Ronald Silliman (T=
he New Sentence, 1987). Here she complicates and expands their work substan=
tially, as she transposes the L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E poet emphasis on writing onto=
 the medium of film. Whereas the L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E poets seem always to be re=
writing Gertrude Stein, Child's work seems much more expansive, with a rich=
er range of reference.... Including especially moving forays into issues of=
 sexuality, the totality of the book gives a fine description of the potent=
ial of experimental filmmaking. Tom Gunning provides a concise, instructive=
 foreword. Summing Up: Highly recommended."-S.C. Dillon, Bates College.

By Elriede Jelinek, Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, 2004

Translated from the German by P.J. Blumenthal
Nonfiction 66 pages $13.00 ISBN-13: 978-0-942996-58-6
ISBN-10: 0-942996-58-5

and

Figured Image


By Anne-Marie Albiach

Translated from the French by Keith Waldrop
Poetry 94 pages $18.00 ISBN-13: 978-0-942996-59-3
ISBN-10: 0-942996-59-3


On Einar :

Elfriede Jelinek , who was born in 1946 in M=FCrzzuschlag, Austria, is the =
most verbally powerful writer in present-day German-language literature. He=
r works and public statements continue to provoke disparate reactions. In 2=
004 Jelinek received the Nobel Prize for literature, and this decision also=
 caused considerable controversy within the German-speaking sphere as well =
as internationally.

In 1998, the German writer and director Einar Schleef staged Jelinek's most=
 important drama Sportst=FCck for the Vienna City Theater, and so immediate=
ly became Jelinek's favorite director. The production of an additional Jeli=
nek piece was interrupted by Schleef's illness. To everyone's surprise, he =
died shortly thereafter.

Subsequently Jelinek ventured to compose three portraits of Schleef, which =
P. J. Blumenthal has translated for this little volume. They show Jelinek a=
t the height of her powers, with her inimitable, musically overflowing, iro=
ny-infected style of exaggeration, and will awaken curiosity about her work=
, as well as about the figure of Einar Schleef, who still remains completel=
y unknown in the English-speaking world.

As Jelinek has written, "There were only two geniuses in postwar Germany: F=
assbinder in the West, and Schleef in the East. They were both insatiable, =
but only in order to be able to give more. In the end, they gave themselves=
. They stumbled over themselves and spit out their hearts."
-Hans-Ulrich M=FCller-Schwefe


Works by Elfriede Jelinek include The Piano Teacher (2002) , Women as Lover=
s ( 1995), Lust (1993) , and Wonderful, Wonderful Times (1990), all transla=
ted by P.J. Blumenthal and published by Serpent's Tail Press. She has recei=
ved over twenty literary prizes and awards in addition to winning the Nobel=
 Prize for Literature in 2004.
-----
On Figured Image:

Anne-Marie Albiach's words are never alone on the page, having each other f=
or company, just as they find here ideal companionship in Keith Waldrop's t=
ranslation. In Figurations de l'image , Albiach pursues her rigorous invest=
igation into the possibilities of measure, the perceptible, luminescence, v=
ulnerability, memory, contour, ardor, breath, oscillation, remonstration, t=
rajectory, disparity, abstraction, antecedence, disparity, refraction, trac=
e, tapestry, rehearsal, reverberation, and the irreparable. In these poems,=
 the figures refute image as they bank, relapse, surge, palsy, recollect. A=
lbiach scores space to twine time, abjures rhyme to make blank shimmer in t=
he mark.
-Charles Bernstein


The Post-Apollo Press is honored to release Figured Image , a new collectio=
n of poetry by Anne-Marie Albiach. Since the publication of =C9tat by Mercu=
re de France in 1971, Albiach has remained a signal presence in French poet=
ry and beyond, impacting American poets and artists such as Barbara Guest a=
nd Richard Tuttle. Bound by a geometry where language and body converge, Fi=
gured Image offers a lyricism that "breathes differently," luring the reade=
r down darkening roads of memory, desire, and chance.


Translated works by Anne-Marie Albiach include Mezza Voce (The Post-Apollo =
Press, 1988), =C9tat (Awede, 1989), "Vocative Figure"( Allardyce Books, 199=
2), A Geometry (Burning Deck, 1998), A Discursive Space : I nterviews with =
Jean Daive (Duration Press, 1999), and Two Poems: Flammigere & the Line =A6=
 the Loss (Shearsman Books, 2004). EXC=C8S: cette mesure first appeared as =
a collaboration with Richard Tuttle. It was published by Yvon Lambert, Pari=
s, 2002.

Keith Waldrop is the author of eighteen books of poetry including The Real =
Subject: Queries and Conjectures of Jacob Delafon=A6 with Sample Poems (Omn=
idawn, 2004) and The House Seen from Nowhere (Litmus Press, 2003). He co-ed=
its Burning Deck press with Rosmarie Waldrop. His translations of contempor=
ary French poetry have been supported by two NEA fellowships and the govern=
ment of France has awarded him the rank of Chevalier des Arts et des Lettre=
s.

Richard Burns
Richard Burns wins 2007 Serbian "Great Lesson" Literary Prize

CAMBRIDGE, UK Tues, Oct 10, 2006 (Salt Publishing) - Richard Burns has won =
the 2007 Veliki =A8kolski cas Prize.

Following the publication of The Blue Butterfly in September, Burns's book =
has been awarded the Serbian literary prize by the City of Kragujevac, the =
location and impetus behind many of the poems. The prize involves a televis=
ed performance of an oratorio based on the book before an international aud=
ience and its publication in Serbian.

The twin points of departure for the book are a Nazi massacre that took pla=
ce in Kragujevac, central Serbia, in October 1941, and the poet's encounter=
 with a blue butterfly at the same location in May 1985. The launch in Lond=
on on 19th October this year takes place exactly 65 years after the massacr=
e. In November Richard Burns will appear on the BBC Radio 3 programme The V=
erb.

The Blue Butterfly (Salt Publishing 2006) =A310.99 ISBN 1-84471-258-3

"This is real poetry. The whole book is an extremely impressive achievement=
." -Frank Kermode

"Epic poems are rare. This is one. Richard Burns is one of the major half-h=
idden poets of England. The book is a monument: vivid, grave, sorrowful, an=
gry and powerfully constructed, a human act of commemoration." -George Szir=
tes

Hipponax, Mimnermus, and Alcman; "Alcman", featuring translations from the =
7th century Spartan poet and composer of songs for girls' chorus; "Hipponax=
", with translations of poems by the 5th century iambicist/ street poet fro=
m Ephesos; and "Honey Nor Bee" with fragments of Sappho sung in Greek and E=
nglish.

"This meld of words from the 7th to the 4th centuries B.C. with music of th=
e turn of the American 20th century works near flawlessly. A simple string-=
band strum backs Downing's beautifully country reading of Sappho 31, part o=
f which Jickling and Mason translate to, "Silently my tongue lies broken / =
Beneath my skin a fire is smoking". It's a lyric in imagery and tone that s=
ounds as backwoods, old, weird American as anything from Harry Smith's Anth=
ology of American Folk Music." -Bret McCabe, Baltimore City Paper

A note from Anthony Barnett in England:

Dear Correspondents and Friends

Kindly excuse this multi-sent message about two remarkable 2007 projects.

*

HENRY CROWDER


I am pleased to tell you that the long-ago announced Allardyce Book
monograph + CD Listening for Henry Crowder is at last on track for
firm publication in 2007, scheduled for the fall.

There have been exiciting developments:

Firstly, the wonderful New York-based vocalist Allan Harris has kindly
accepted to record the six settings by Crowder to poems by Nancy Cunard,
Samuel Beckett and others, which Cunard published as Henry-Music in Paris in
1930. As most of you know, all these compositions were supposed to have been
recorded at the time by Crowder, but only one disc, with one of the
compositions, has ever been discovered and it is now thought likely that the
remaining songs were never released. Crowder's recording will be included on
the CD along with Allan Harris's new recordings of all six songs, which will
be the debut recording of five of them, including the poem Beckett specially
wrote for Crowder. Allan Harris's work can be heard and seen at
http://www.allanharris.com

In 1926, the year before Crowder became violinist Eddie South's pianist, he
recorded six player piano rolls. All the rolls will be included on the CD in
performances by Julian Dyer from transcriptions and restorations by Robbie
Rhodes from the originals (one of which is known only in one damaged copy)
kindly loaned from the collections of Michael Montgomery and Frank Himpsl.
This team of four is truly the best in the world of player piano rolls and
their contribution to this project is enormous.

Attached for information is a pdf file of a draft (please note, draft only)
of the front and back covers of the forthcoming monograph.

*

SWING STRINGS

I am also pleased to announce that in 2007 AB Fable has scheduled for
release a 2CD set examining part of the history of Swing Strings entitled
Swinging Till the Girls Come Home (the title of an Oscar Pettiford tune
recorded by Pettiford with Harry Lookofsky.)

The first CD will be an anthology of mainly small Swing String groups (i.e.
more than one violin) 1930s-1950s. It will include some unreleased and
broadcast items.

With the kind assistance of violinist Gayle Dixon and cellist Akua Dixon,
both founding members of the very first Max Roach Double Quartet, the second
CD will document previously unreleased recordings with them from the 1970s
and 1980s, including the most extraordinary rehearsals with Max Roach, and
larger ensembles. Gayle Dixon's work in documenting the violin in jazz is at
http://jazzbows.com and Akua Dixon's website is http://www.akuadixon.com

More information about this release will be mailed in some months.

Please write if you have any questions.

Many thanks

With warmest regards

Anthony Barnett

The University of California Press is pleased to announce the publication o=
f:
The Collected Poems of Robert Creeley, 1975-2005
Robert Creeley

 Robert Creeley feature
 Jacket 31: link

Robert Creeley (1926-2005) published more than sixty books of poetry, prose=
, essays, and interviews in the United States and abroad. His many honors i=
ncluded the Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award, the Frost Medal, the Shelley=
 Memorial Award, and the Bollingen Prize in Poetry. He was a member of the =
American Academy of Arts and Letters and Distinguished Professor in the Gra=
duate Program in Literary Arts at Brown University.

"Robert Creeley has created a noble body of poetry that extends the work of=
 his predecessors Pound, Williams, Zukofsky, and Olson, and provides like t=
hem a method for his successors in exploring our new American poetic consci=
ousness." - Allen Ginsberg

This definitive collection showcases thirty years of work by one of the mos=
t significant American poets of the twentieth century, bringing together ve=
rse that originally appeared in eight acclaimed books of poetry ranging fro=
m Hello: A Journal (1978) to Life & Death (1998) and If I were writing this=
 (2003). Robert Creeley, who was involved with the publication of this volu=
me before his death in 2005, helped define an emerging counter-tradition to=
 the prevailing literary establishment-the new postwar poetry originating w=
ith Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, and Louis Zukofsky and expanding t=
hrough the lives and works of Charles Olson, Robert Duncan, Allen Ginsberg,=
 Denise Levertov, and others.

The Collected Poems of Robert Creeley, 1975-2005 will be essential reading =
for anyone interested in twentieth-century American poetry. Full informatio=
n about the book, including the table of contents, is available online: htt=
p://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/10161.html

For the past few weeks I've been revising and redesigning "Reality =
Dreams," my autobiographical journal originally digitized around =
1992-1994.=20
Finished--if anything is ever finished--the work yesterday. It's a big =
piece of work, in 16 sections. As it is already in my archive, thought =
I'd send the link to a few lists and friends before it's forgotten: =

No Sex

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RyU0jfF99A (clearer version below)

The promise of no sex. I will not do sex again. I will not have nudity
again in my texts. I will not mention body parts again. I will be perfect
again. I will be newborn again. I will not characterize men or women
again. I will not have sexual violence again in my texts. I will not have
sexual activity again in my work. I will not have masturbation again in my
work and will not have intercourse in my work. I am swamped with attention
given to the sex, nudity, body parts, sexual violence, sexual activity,
masturbation, and intercourse in my work. I am exhausted by sex. I am
exhausted by televised sex, motion picture sex, photographed sex, dreamed
sex, spoken sex, poetics of sex. I may work with dance and sex and
dance-video and sex. I will not work with images of sexual violence. I
will not do sexual violence. I have never done sexual violence. I have
never done violence. I am frightened of violence. I am frightened by
encounters with strangers. I am frightened of meetings in unaccustomed
space. I will not write of violence in lonely place, forsaken places,
ruined places. Ruins write my texts. Ruins do not write sex, do not write
sexual violence. I am tired of being misunderstood. I am tired of playing
the misunderstood boohoo little boy. I am tired of being the little boy
who does no good. I am tired of being the misogynist who burns women at
the stake, who burns men at the stake, who erects the stake, who burns
children at the stake. I am tired of dumb organs and description of dumb
organs. I will write politics without sex and politics without sexual
violence and politics without sexual words and politics without words or
actions that may be misunderstood. I will learn to be good. I will never
be forgiven. I will learn to go on. I will learn to write again. I will
learn to film again. I will learn sound and sight again. I will learn to
dance.

Moving Her Body in Her Second Life

Today I revisited Second Life and gave new Life to my Avatar and now Her
Body moves just like I would move if I had a File called God.

God makes Dojoji move and God infuses Her with Life new-born, glorious
Life, lovely in Conception and Deed. I cannot say enough about Her
Appearance, but it will remain with me until the Rapture, when she will
lead the Procession of Salvation, Holiest among the Holy, Saved among the
Saved, New-Born among the New-Born.

http://www.asondheim.org/flop.mov

Yes, and Delicious with the Sweetness of the Nectar of the Lord. I would
love Her Strong, were it not for my Love of God; I would worship Her, were
it not for Strong Salvation. She shall Ascend to the Holy of Holies; She
will draw me up; I will not be far behind. For She accords me the Grace of
Creation, just as I accord her the Wager of Sin.

Together we shudder at the very Sight of the Eternal, We Love each Other
so very much!

Alice Coltrane Dies At 69
Jazz Pianist Was Also A Spiritual Leader
January 14, 2007
Los Angeles Times

http://www.courant.com/news/nationworld/hc-
coltrane0114.artjan14,0,2553918.story

LOS ANGELES -- Alice Coltrane, the jazz performer and composer who
was inextricably linked with the adventurous musical improvisations
of her late husband, the legendary saxophonist John Coltrane, has
died. She was 69.

Coltrane died Friday at West Hills Hospital in Los Angeles, according
to family friends. She had been in frail health for some time and
died of respiratory failure.

Though known to many for her contributions to jazz and early new age
music, Coltrane, a convert to Hinduism, was also a significant
spiritual leader and founded the Vedantic Center, a spiritual commune
now in Agoura, Calif. A guru of growing repute, she also served as
the swami of the San Fernando Valley's first Hindu Temple, in
Chatsworth.

For much of the past 40 years, she was also the keeper of her
husband's musical legacy, managing his archive and estate. Her
husband, one of the pivotal figures in the history of jazz, died of
liver disease on July 17, 1967, at the age of 40.

A pianist and organist, Alice Coltrane was noted for her astral
compositions and for bringing the harp onto the jazz bandstand. Her
last performances came in the fall, when she participated in an
abbreviated tour that included stops in New York and San Francisco,
playing with her saxophonist son, Ravi.

She was born Alice McLeod in Detroit on Aug. 27, 1937, into a family
with deep musical roots. Anna, her mother, sang and played piano in
the Baptist church choir. Alice's brother Ernie Farrow was a bassist
who played professionally with groups led by saxophonist Yusef Lateef
and vibes player Terry Gibbs.

Alice began her musical education at the age of 7, learning classical
piano. Her early musical career included performances in church
groups and as well as in top-flight jazz ensembles led by Lateef,
guitarist Kenny Burrell and saxophonist Lucky Thompson.

After studying jazz piano briefly in Paris, she moved to New York and
joined Gibbs' quartet.

She met John Coltrane in 1963 while playing an engagement with Gibbs'
group at Birdland in New York City.

"He saw something in her that was beautiful," Gibbs, who has often
taken credit for introducing the two, told the Los Angeles Times.

She left Gibbs' band to marry Coltrane and began performing with her
husband's band in 1965, replacing pianist McCoy Tyner.

Sad, sad news.  I had the privilege of seeing her perform late last year
during the San Francisco jazz festival - one of the most memorable
concerts I've ever seen.  She and her son Ravi played together - along
with John Coltrane's original bassist and drummer.  They ended the show
with a tribute to Coltrane.  Everyone stood up.  Many were crying.

If you've never listened to Alice Coltrane's harp and piano playing, you
must.  Her music is galactic, necessary.

Alice Coltrane, 69; performer, composer of jazz and New Age music;
spiritual leader
By Jon Thurber, Times Staff Writer
January 14, 2007

Alice Coltrane, the jazz performer and composer who was inextricably
linked with the adventurous musical improvisations of her late husband,
legendary saxophonist John Coltrane, has died. She was 69.

Coltrane died Friday at West Hills Hospital and Medical Center in West
Hills, according to an announcement from the family's publicist. She had
been in frail health for some time and died of respiratory failure.

Though known to many for her contributions to jazz and early New Age

leader and founded the Vedantic Center, a spiritual commune now located
in Agoura Hills. A guru of growing repute, she also served as the swami
of the San Fernando Valley's first Hindu temple, in Chatsworth.

For much of the last nearly 40 years, she was also the keeper of her
husband's musical legacy, managing his archive and estate. Her husband,
one of the pivotal figures in the history of jazz, died of liver disease
July 17, 1967, at the age of 40.

A pianist and organist, Alice Coltrane was noted for her astral
compositions and for bringing the harp onto the jazz bandstand. Her last
performances came in the fall, when she participated in an abbreviated
tour that included stops in New York and San Francisco, playing with her
saxophonist son, Ravi.

She was born Alice McLeod in Detroit on Aug. 27, 1937, into a family
with deep musical roots. Anna, her mother, sang and played piano in the
Baptist church choir. Alice's half brother Ernie Farrow was a bassist
who played professionally with groups led by saxophonist Yusef Lateef
and vibes player Terry Gibbs.

Alice began her musical education at age 7, learning classical piano.
Her early musical career included performances in church groups as well
as in top-flight jazz ensembles led by Lateef, guitarist Kenny Burrell
and saxophonist Lucky Thompson.

After studying jazz piano briefly in Paris, she moved to New York and
joined Gibbs' quartet.

"As fascinating - and influential - as her later music was, it tended to
obscure the fact that she had started out as a solid, bebop-oriented
pianist," critic Don Heckman told The Times on Saturday. "I remember
hearing, and jamming with, her in the early '60s at photographer W.
Eugene Smith's loft in Manhattan. At that time she played with a brisk,
rhythmic style immediately reminiscent of Bud Powell.

"Like a few other people who'd heard her either at the loft or during
her early '60s gigs with Terry Gibbs, I kept hoping she'd take at least
one more foray into the bebop style she played so well," he said.

She met her future husband in 1963 while playing an engagement with
Gibbs' group at Birdland in New York City.

"He saw something in her that was beautiful," Gibbs, who has often taken
credit for introducing the two, told The Times on Saturday. "They were
both very shy in a way. It was beautiful to see them fall in love."

Gibbs called her "the nicest person I ever worked with. She was a real
lady."

She left Gibbs' band to marry Coltrane and began performing with his
band in the mid-1960s, replacing pianist McCoy Tyner. She developed a
style noted for its power and freedom and played tour dates with
Coltrane's group in San Francisco, New York and Tokyo.

She would say her husband's musical impact was enormous.

"John showed me how to play fully," she told interviewer Pauline Rivelli
and Robert Levin in comments published in "The Black Giants."

"In other words, he'd teach me not to stay in one spot and play in one
chord pattern. 'Branch out, open up . play your instrument entirely.' .
John not only taught me how to explore, but to play thoroughly and
completely."

After his death, she devoted herself to raising their children.
Musically, she continued to play within his creative vision, surrounding
herself with such like-minded performers as saxophonists Pharoah Sanders
and Joe Henderson.

Early albums under her name, including "A Monastic Trio," and "Ptah the
El Daoud," were greeted with critical praise for her compositions and
playing. "Ptah the El Daoud" featured her sweeping harp flourishes, a
sound not commonly heard in jazz recordings. Her last recording,
"Translinear Light," came in 2004. It was her first jazz album in 26
years.

Through the 1970s, she continued to explore Eastern religions, traveling
to India to study with Swami Satchidananda, the founder of the Integral
Yoga Institute.

Upon her return she started a store-front ashram in San Francisco but
soon moved it to Woodland Hills in 1975. Located in the Santa Monica
Mountains since the early 1980s, the ashram is a 48-acre compound where
devotees concentrate on prayer and meditation.

Known within her religious community by her Sanskrit name,
Turiyasangitananda, Coltrane focused for much of the last 25 years on
composing and recording devotional music such as Hindu chants, hymns and
melodies for meditation. She also wrote books, including "Monumental
Ethernal," a kind of spiritual biography, and "Endless Wisdom," which
she once told a Times reporter contained hundreds of scriptures divinely
revealed to her.

In 2001 she helped found the John Coltrane Foundation to encourage jazz
performances and award scholarships to young musicians.

In addition to Ravi, she is survived by another son, Oren, who plays
guitar and alto sax; a daughter, Michelle, who is a singer; and five
grandchildren. Her son John Coltrane Jr. died in an automobile accident
in 1982.

Thanks for posting this, mIEKAL. It is sad. Although I didn't follow her
music very much after Trane's death, I enjoyed what she did with his last
group, which left a lot of other people in the dust. I like music that
rearranges my central nervous system through ecstatic experience.

It's curious the piece came from the Hartford Courant. Despite my issues
with the city, it's home to a lot of good jazz musicians and knowledgeable
listeners. The notice didn't appear in today's Sun-Sentinel.

July 17, 1967, at the age of 40.

A pianist and organist, Alice Coltrane was noted for her astral
compositions and for bringing the harp onto the jazz bandstand. Her last
performances came in the fall, when she participated in an abbreviated
tour that included stops in New York and San Francisco, playing with her
saxophonist son, Ravi.

She was born Alice McLeod in Detroit on Aug. 27, 1937, into a family
with deep musical roots. Anna, her mother, sang and played piano in the
Baptist church choir. Alice's half brother Ernie Farrow was a bassist
who played professionally with groups led by saxophonist Yusef Lateef
and vibes player Terry Gibbs.

Alice began her musical education at age 7, learning classical piano.
Her early musical career included performances in church groups as well
as in top-flight jazz ensembles led by Lateef, guitarist Kenny Burrell
and saxophonist Lucky Thompson.

After studying jazz piano briefly in Paris, she moved to New York and
joined Gibbs' quartet.

&quot;As fascinating - and influential - as her later music was, it tended to
obscure the fact that she had started out as a solid, bebop-oriented
pianist,&quot; critic Don Heckman told The Times on Saturday. &quot;I remember
hearing, and jamming with, her in the early '60s at photographer W.
Eugene Smith's loft in Manhattan. At that time she played with a brisk,
rhythmic style immediately reminiscent of Bud Powell.

&quot;Like a few other people who'd heard her either at the loft or during
her early '60s gigs with Terry Gibbs, I kept hoping she'd take at least
one more foray into the bebop style she played so well,&quot; he said.

She met her future husband in 1963 while playing an engagement with
Gibbs' group at Birdland in New York City.

&quot;He saw something in her that was beautiful,&quot; Gibbs, who has often taken
credit for introducing the two, told The Times on Saturday. &quot;They were
both very shy in a way. It was beautiful to see them fall in love.&quot;

Gibbs called her &quot;the nicest person I ever worked with. She was a real
lady.&quot;

She left Gibbs' band to marry Coltrane and began performing with his
band in the mid-1960s, replacing pianist McCoy Tyner. She developed a
style noted for its power and freedom and played tour dates with
Coltrane's group in San Francisco, New York and Tokyo.

She would say her husband's musical impact was enormous.

&quot;John showed me how to play fully,&quot; she told interviewer Pauline Rivelli
and Robert Levin in comments published in &quot;The Black Giants.&quot;

&quot;In other words, he'd teach me not to stay in one spot and play in one
chord pattern. 'Branch out, open up . play your instrument entirely.' .
John not only taught me how to explore, but to play thoroughly and
completely.&quot;

After his death, she devoted herself to raising their children.
Musically, she continued to play within his creative vision, surrounding
herself with such like-minded performers as saxophonists Pharoah Sanders
and Joe Henderson.

Early albums under her name, including &quot;A Monastic Trio,&quot; and &quot;Ptah the
El Daoud,&quot; were greeted with critical praise for her compositions and
playing. &quot;Ptah the El Daoud&quot; featured her sweeping harp flourishes, a
sound not commonly heard in jazz recordings. Her last recording,
&quot;Translinear Light,&quot; came in 2004. It was her first jazz album in 26
years.

Through the 1970s, she continued to explore Eastern religions, traveling
to India to study with Swami Satchidananda, the founder of the Integral
Yoga Institute.

Upon her return she started a store-front ashram in San Francisco but
soon moved it to Woodland Hills in 1975. Located in the Santa Monica
Mountains since the early 1980s, the ashram is a 48-acre compound where
devotees concentrate on prayer and meditation.

Known within her religious community by her Sanskrit name,
Turiyasangitananda, Coltrane focused for much of the last 25 years on
composing and recording devotional music such as Hindu chants, hymns and
melodies for meditation. She also wrote books, including &quot;Monumental
Ethernal,&quot; a kind of spiritual biography, and &quot;Endless Wisdom,&quot; which
she once told a Times reporter contained hundreds of scriptures divinely
revealed to her.

In 2001 she helped found the John Coltrane Foundation to encourage jazz
performances and award scholarships to young musicians.

In addition to Ravi, she is survived by another son, Oren, who plays
guitar and alto sax; a daughter, Michelle, who is a singer; and five
grandchildren. Her son John Coltrane Jr. died in an automobile accident
in 1982.

Dear Folks,

The current issue of listenlight <http://listenlight.net/06> requires
work in the stead of our slated starter, who has withdrawn her work due
to a misunderstanding.  Women especially are encouraged to send work,
(as the roster is predominantly "male" without her), hopefully work that
can resonate to the chord of the issue, which is somewhat dark.
Further, all work will be kept for potential review for next issue 07.
So, this is also a call for work for issue 07.

Best wishes,
Jesse Crockett

Gee, I've never met a new formalist; I'd avoid them if I were you. I =
read about nude formalists somewhere, and I've been a fan of the old =
Russian formalists. As applied to traditionally metered poetry the =
theory is quite easy, performance or hearing has to work between two =
templates, that of meter and that of the linguist's description of =
speech, and doing so requires some interpretative decision-making. This =
is where the practice of listening is crucial, which has to be learned =
in other ways. I'm not expert in how to do this, but songs are helpful =
and often students brings listening skills gained from their knowledge =
of music that can be applied to poetry,
Wystan

   Can anyone recommend a dense and comprensive book on poetic form?
Ideally I want to be able to look up any poetic form in this book and

Any suggestions would be kindly appreciated!

For a comprehensive text, I'd recommend "The New Princeton Encyclopedia of

Writers Handbook of Poetic Forms," edited by Ron Padgett.

Hey, Tony--

I'm really just seconding what Dan wrote, but I wanted to add that if
you want the comprehensive, go with the Princeton book, and if you want
the playful (and maybe more user-friendly or writerly), go with the
Padgett book.  I use both all the time, depending on context.

Best,
Tony

I haven't found the perfect book on form, certainly not the definitive.
I've tried Padgett and find it adequate, but not inspiring. Depending on
the level of class/workshop texts that have essays and a wider range of
samples are more effective. The Annie Finch/Katherine Varnes text is quite
good in that respect.

Tony -

  I looked at the Princeton book on Amazon and I definitely feel that
is what I'm looking for.  But I like your idea - I'll probably end up
getting both, but I'll start off with the Princeton!

  By the way - this is Tony Hooper.  And yes I probably should have
asked this question a long time ago, but I'm just getting around to it
now!

  I've been well - I'm still working for http://www.zzounds.com/ one
of the perks being that I get great deals on gear.  I started playing
with a new band this month and that's been going great so far (I will
of course let you know if we play any high profile venues...)

  I mostly lurk on this listserve - It's a way (one of the ways) for
me to keep up on what's going on in the poetry world.  I've found many
cool websites / resources because of this list, but a few people who
post here can drive me crazy!

Thanks for the suggestions!

Tony

Aaron Belz has published poems in Fence, Fine Madness, Painted Bride
Quarterly, Matter, Mudfish, and other places, and has new work forthcoming
in Lit, The Hat, and Van Gogh's Ear. Of his book soon to be published by
BlazeVOX, Denise Duhamel writes: "Aaron Belz is a gravely hilarious poet.
The poems from The Bird Hoverer are part Discovery Channel, party History
Channel, part E!-his ferocious intelligence, his love of glitz, and his wry
take on relationships (both human and animal) are irresistible. Belz's voice
is bold, wise, inimitable."

Kristy Odelius is a poet and Assistant Professor of English at North Park
University (Chicago, IL) where she teaches poetry and 19th century British
literature. She is a co-founder of Near South, a Chicago-based journal of

Subject:      Re: beggins the answer - why perform
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I think an interesting subpart to the question is why perform *where* you
perform? Who are you hoping to reach?  What are you hoping to do with the
material?

There's something very great about re-envisioning words on a page for
performance--to be read with music, with multiple voices, with video, or
just as a straightforward reading.  Readings encourage collaborations.  They
encourage face to face interactions, which many poets and writers I know
consider an important value in this world of disembodied work posted in
cyberspace or published in books.  They encourage you to encounter people
who do read your poetry, who don't read your poetry, who read other poetry
but not yours, or who never read poetry.  They give you the chance to talk
to these people about what they think about poetry and what they think
poetry is and why it is (or is not) important to you and them. In short, the
open up dialogues that might not otherwise ever happen.  And even if they
don't open up a dialogue between you and the audience, who knows what gets
talked about after the reading?  Two people who came to your reading
together leave with a shared experience they will likely discuss.  Further,
if you get out of the bookstores, coffee shops and art galleries, you can
almost always read your work to people that would not necessarily go out and
buy poetry and you can turn people on to poetry that way by reading it
outloud, as well as by integrating it into every day life or into other
spaces where people aren't expecting to encounter poetry.

I mean, it's the same with all live media.  Why go to the theatre rather
than watch a movie?  Why go to a live concert rather than buy a record?
There's a shared experience, an alchemy of bodies, a timber of voice and
interaction of humans that mediated forms don't allow.  It's not merely a
"reading" of your work, it's an entirely different form of what you've taken
the time to create and an entirely different way of sharing it with the
world.

IMHO.

hey patrick, yeah,


ok, so why not change the thread to begging the answer,
because i am still wondering what about performing,  who is it for,
for instance the MLA readings, and the posting to this list about how it
might be more fun if we just
showed up and talked to each other.

like at gallery openings when everybody shows up to look at who else is
there, not the art.

what do you think? do you perform? who is it for, you
or the audience?  IF its for them what do you owe them

For that matter, thinking that you have something others should read also
takes a massive ego . . .  putting any creation of yours out into the world
and thinking others would or should care is all of the same impulse, n'est
pas?  That gets to the whole question of why we create at all???

Is this merely a lesson of the internet? Doesn't the barrage of new books at
the front table of Barnes & Noble (paid for by Random House), the new
releases at Tower Records (probably paid for by some record label), etc.
etc. etc. confirm that impulse?

Happy Martin Luther King Day -- a la James Baldwin:

  "White people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this -- which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never -- the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed."  (Ticket 340)











  Baldwin believed that "whoever debases others is debasing himself" (Ticket 369).

thanks for sharing these thoughts...feelings....words...

i like that these words don't seem to approach the subject judgmentally
(or, if so, only by judging the impulse to judge...)

what is the feeling of "a massive ego" anyway?

something to be lost in the process/product of creation?
something to be found (and/or gained) in said process?
or, sometimes, both simulatanously?
    I wonder if I've been trying to articulate something like the
"poetics of James Brown"
off and on since boxing day eve-eve,
          James Brown's relation to "the massive ego?'
           James Brown, as a verb as much as a noun, even to himself...
              to DO the "James Brown"
        and the more strictly speaking "poetic" analogues or
references of same...
         "how can we tell the dancer from the dance" etc...

or Whitman's "massive ego"---so massive it is also on another level
an impersonal force
      (not merely "no ideas but in things"), but relational,
dramatic, so-called 'eastern'
     notions of the self----
       ah, some may need to call it anti-intellectual--in Brown's case--
         but "Think" from the early 60s can be as intellectual as any
Bob Dylan or Stravinski....Ashbery..

just some rudimentary notes right now...
more later...
         perhaps 'elsewhere...'

I remember a Paris Review interview with authors and associates of the editor Bob Gottlieb.
His egotism was the subject of much commentary, but one remark stood out:"The thing about Bob's ego is, it's like a huge umbrella, big enough for two people."

Here's a paper ( http://www.rilune.org/mono5/brillenburg.pdf ) by Kiene
Brillenburg Wurth from Utrecht University called "Multimediality,
Intermediality, and Medially Complex Digital Poetry" that mentions, among
others, works by Jason Nelson, Aya Karpinska, and myself.

I'm not sure why she'd mention my work, because I have it on authority from
the Canada Council's Intermedia guy that my work is not intermedia.

The Sexiest Poem of the Year Award is given annually to a finely crafted
poem demonstrating a fearlessness which confronts injustice. The panel of judges
is CAConrad sitting in five different chairs manifesting five different
facial  expressions. The judges must have a unanimous decision in order for the
award to  be granted. In the case where a unanimous decision is not decided upon,
no award  will be granted that year.

This issue seems central to me, because its a part of my poetics.
I feel some divergence between written & performance work.
My suspicion is that most of us perform for ourselves first and for the
audience second, at least,
that=B9s how we have to begin, because lets face it in the beginning we=B9re a
bit crap.


when i am a member of the audience I want to be enthralled, like the
peasants at the Globe,
in the cheap seats in the pit, leaning on the stage, yelling out Ahhh and
Ohhh when people are
stabbed and die.

so when i get up on stage myself, i try & remember what its like to sit in
the audience and be bored, i want to prevent that so I make a lot of noise,
I keep the audience in mind, change gears accordingly.

when i sit on the side of the stage during the readings that we organise, w=
e
can massage the shoulders of the poets all we want, but once they get up
there, like boxers, its all them, they are taking a sacred space; the stage=
,
they=B9re in control.

the audience we invite to the readings have often worked all week, are
tired, and we don=B9t consider that they are doing us a favor; they pay, and
we need to entertain them. It=B9s a painful thing to watch an audience start
to =B3resent=B2 a poet, meaning that their eyes glaze over.

yes of course this is worst case scenario,

perhaps that=B9s where i am going with this obligation thing


who else organises poetry evenings out there?

The book I've used for many years both as a poet and a teacher is the Teacher's & Writers Book of Poetic Form edited by Ron Padgett and published by Teachers & Writers Collaborative in New York City.  It is dependable and useful in just about all forms.  The only questionable entry I know of relates to the ghazal.  Regards, Tom Savage

Can anyone recommend a dense and comprensive book on poetic form?
Ideally I want to be able to look up any poetic form in this book and

specifications of the form.

Any suggestions would be kindly appreciated!

Thanks!

Any of you who have written poems about Rumsfeld, written using
Rumsfeld's language, or composed under the spell of our former Defense
Secretary (sic), please backchannel me.  I'd like to write about the
phenomenon of Rummy poems, having written at least one myself and aware
of many others.

If you've never heard of Peter Jay Shippy, then that means you
probably haven't read any of his poems, and THAT means you are missing
out.

directors of UNESCO=B9s History of Mankind project since 1979, and as cultura=
l
advisor to the government of Barbados from 1975=AD1979 and since 1990. His
book The Zea Mexican Diary (1993) was the Village Voice Book of the Year.
Some of his many works include Middle Passages (1994), Ancestors (2001), Th=
e
Development of Creole Society, 1770-1820 (2005). Brathwaite is currently a
professor of comparative literature at New York University, and shares his

Spring Workshops at the Poetry Project



The Poetry School Of Poetry =AD  Douglas Rothschild
Tuesdays at 7 Pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 13th

Writing  poetry is difficult; writing good poetry, more difficult still. In
this  workshop, we will focus on exactly what we think is good in a poem &
determine how our senses of aesthetics inform our responses to this
question. Working within our own aesthetic notions we will then begin to
refine our  writing, & help each other to write the best poems that we can.
The workshop  will conduct a number of actual experiments with writing that
will allow us to  step outside the world of id, which wants to keep all the
beautiful words,  & into the artistic self, which understands which pieces
fit & which  belong elsewhere. We will also engage the basic Poetry School
of Poetry premise  that the poet=B9s first job is to learn how to edit. Dgls
N. Rthschld has been  behind the foods table at the New Years Reading more
times than it is worth  mentioning. He has also written a number of
chapbooks, the most ground breaking  entitled The Minor Arcane.  He has
taught what seem to be innumerable college writing classes, and is
currently teaching at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, a CUNY
school.=20


The Visible Unseen: Writing Outside Borders =AD Akilah Oliver
Thursdays at 7 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 15th

Are  poetry and prose virtual realities, simulations of something other, or
the real  thing? Where does the =B3I=B2  live? How many moments exist in  the
moment of the line? What  borders of form are crucial for us to hang on to =
&
which boundaries are  collapsible? In this workshop, we  will explore the
connections and tensions between the visible and the unseen  world/s, not a=
s
dualities or binaries, but as complementary sites of  composition. Through
engagement with text (written and visual), public spaces, the imagination,
dreams and Eros, participants are invited to think of writing as that which
re-imagines the known and the unknown. Though this is a text based workshop=
,
poets, prose writers, and artists from all disciplines are welcome. Reading=
s
include: Giorgio Agamben, Laura Mullen, Whitman, Anne Waldman, Derrida, &
Ben Okri. Akilah Oliver is the  author of the she said dialogues: flesh
memory, An Arriving Guard of Angels, Thusly  Coming to Greet, a(A)gust, &
The Putterer=B9s Notebook. She is faculty at the Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics Summer  Writing Program at Naropa University.


Impurity  Rocks! A Poetry Lab & Workshop =AD Joanna Fuhrman
Fridays at 7 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 16th

The class will focus on  =B3impure=B2 poetry, poetry that employs a mixture of
tones and styles. Special  emphasis will be placed on works that combine
narrative and humor with  linguistic and imagistic disjunction. In-class
exercises and take-home assignments  will touch on issues of scale, space,
sound, genre and wordplay. Time will also  be devoted to reading published
poems as well as in-depth discussions and  critiques of student work. Joann=
a
Fuhrman is the author of three collections of  poetry, Freud in Brooklyn,
Ugh Ugh Ocean and Moraine, all published by Hanging Loose Press. She has
taught poetry  writing at The University of Washington, The Cooper Union
Saturday Outreach  program and in the New York City Public Schools.


Poetry  For The Page, Stage, And Computer Screen =AD Thomas Savage
Saturdays At 12 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 17th

This  course is a writing workshop where students' writing is the main
focus.  Also used as inspiration and writing prompts will be samples of wor=
k
by  writers from The Beats, Black Mountain poets, The New York School (all
generations), Language Poetry, Poets Theater, Pablo Neruda, and works being
published today online, among other sources. Practices will include  readin=
g
as well as writing assignments and, in a great Poetry Project tradition,
in-class writing. Thomas Savage has written eight published books of  poems
including most recently Bamiyan Poems, Brain Surgery Poems and Political
Conditions/Physical  States. His poems  have appeared in many print and
online venues including The New York Times, Hanging Loose, Rattapallax, Big
Bridge, Black Box, and regularly on the Wryting-L website. He has taught
poetry  workshops at The Poetry Project and Tribes Gallery.

Subject:      Announcing WIG and call for submissions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We are pleased to announce the first issue of WIG!

WIG begins by showcasing the exemplary “career” of Kit Robinson, including an interview with the poet about his lifelong practice of “writing work”—a term Juliana Spahr uses to describe her own practice of writing on the job in Live (Duration, 2000)—and a series of twelve poems called “Outbound Logistics,” written during the same period as the poems included in The Crave (Atelos, 2002).

WIG also features work by Chris Alexander, Marcus Bales, Anselm Berrigan, CA Conrad, Laura Elrick, Kristen Gallagher, William Howe, Michael Kelleher, Tim Shaner and Chris Stroffolino and a selection of writings on the work-a-day grind by students from Kristen Gallagher’s creative writing class at Laguardia Community College.

WIG is a low-budget magazine devoted to writing and art composed on the job. Not necessarily “about” work, the wig-artist employs labor for poetic ends that implicitly critique—through the act of poaching company time &/or materials—the productivist logic of what Hannah Arendt calls the “laboring society.”

Beautifully designed by the artist/graphic designer Lawrence Conley, WIG is printed on 8 ½ x 11 standard photocopy paper, sandwiched between a sturdier stock of paper for its covers, and is bound by a single staple in the lower left hand corner.

Please send $4 or say $10 for two issues (just to round it off and to help offset costs – think of the extra $2 as a donation) in the form of cash or a check (made out) to:

Tim Shaner
130 E 49th Ave
Eugene, OR 97405

We welcome submissions of poetry, prose, artwork, essays, book reviews, letters to the editor, assemblages, etc. We also encourage writers to take up Mike Gold’s project, quoted in this issue, by either reporting on their particular industry/job or by keeping a diary of workplace observations and reflections, whether they have to do with work or not.

We prefer email submissions (as word files, pdf, or jpg), sent to: twshaner@comcast.net and/or gallagher.kristen@gmail.com. Otherwise, submit snailmail (w/ SASE) to:

Tim Shaner
130 E 49th Ave
Eugene, OR 97405

 or

Kristen Gallagher
402 Graham Ave., PMB 204
Brooklyn, NY 11211

Please include with your submission a bio that briefly addresses the laboring circumstances embedded in the text.

Hello UBP --

Wondering if anyone can point me to a calendar for poetry events/readings
in SF/Berkeley? I will be there Wednesday-Saturday this week (last minute
decision) and thought I might see what was happening. Additionally, if any
poets want to get together for a drink, drop me a line.

Subject:      Geof Huth on UnlikelyStories 2.0: The Cross Media Issue
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Here is a review by Geof Huth of UnlikelyStories 2.0: The Cross-Media Issue,
guest-edited by Dan Waber:
http://dbqp.blogspot.com/2007/01/bird-in-flight-and-perpetual-motion.html

He doesn't review his own work in this issue, but it's pretty cool.

Geof's "Snowglyphs" is a sequence of 35 photopoems taken of poems
constructed in the snow. Don't ask him to shovel your snow. You might end up
with a driveway of poems instead. The citizens of Schenectady New York,
where Geof Huth lives, shall at least live in occassional perplexity as they
gaze upon these wonders. And should you ever be there and go for a walk with
Huth in the snow, I think you will find it memorable. This man apparently
plays in the snow like none other. Poetry goes where he goes. Whether it's
for a walk in the snow or whatever. Very cool.

There's also his piece "In Germania, the Portuguese Did Sing". This is a
short film. It consists of pannings of a child's notebook who is learning to
write in, I think, Portuguese? This is undoubtedly one of Geof's own
notebooks from his childhood. He lived in many different countries when he
was growing up. It could be any number of languages or one the kid was
making up. The notebook is filled not only with the careful, multi-lined
writings of the notebooks you use when learning to write, but also many
drawings. And the audio is of singing/chanting by an adult (probably Geof);
the music/chanting sounds sort of indigenous to...to I know not where, but
it has a feeling of adventurousness to it, male adventurousness that is
present in childhood and, if we are lucky, survives into adulthood. The
visuals and the audio, together, make the film memorably atmospheric and
insightful into states of mind where the making of things--writing, visuals,
sounds, and films--is participatory in the things which are written about.

I know Geof has been divesting himself of papers from years previous, over
the last months, has been sending many boxes of papers to a University where
they will be archived. "In Germania, the Portuguese Did Sing" feels like the
poet internalising them before sending them off--and making something from
them, as they themselves were makings--recapturing something of them in
contemporary experience.

NEW CBOOKS FROM SMALL CHAPBOOK PROJECT

for early 2007, we present EIGHT new chapbooks, in-
cluding the first '4 around 1', four full-length cbooks by
one writer concerning a matter of his/her own interest.

THE CHAPBOOKS

mIEKAL aND -- Logos Longshot -- essays in poly-
artistry & human interaction. Early notes to aND's life-
work, Samsara Congeries, having a dense syntax and
idea-proliferation.

Martha Deed -- 65 X 65 -- an autobiography in 65 short
paragraphs portraying people important to the poet's
spiritual development, people who have left an imprint.

Michelle Greenblatt/Sheila E Murphy -- Ghazals 1--19
-- An intriguing collaboraiton by two poets in different
stages of their poetic careers. A ghazal is a Persian ecs-
tatic lyric song, with a single voice for the reader.

**'4 around 1'**
Jukka-Pekka Kervinen
   THROUGH LIGHT (#1, katha)
   AND NONE (#2, isa)
   INHALING (#3, taitturuya)
   IS BEHIND (#4, aitareya)
The first in this new series, four chapbooks with a sing-
le concern, this time, a computer manipulation of texts
taken from the Hindu Upanishads. It's interesting to see
how words of a spiritual nature are mixed with every-
thing 'including the kitchen sink' -- computer code, words
and parts of words with no relation to anything but the
air in the center of the heart.

Rob McLennan -- ottawa poems (blue notes) -- Wonder-
ful blues-like improvisations on the poet's home-city char-
acterized by diverse spatial arrays. The poems show Mc-
Lennan's affection for the city.

Send $6 per title ($20 for the '4 around 1' series), plus $1

i've heard of shippy but i've never heard of the judges...

"So here for your enjoyment are the top six stories and twenty-one poems published online between June 1, 2005 and June 30, 2006 as chosen by our guest judges Paul Guest and Jaimee Wriston Colbert."
http://www.sundress.net/bestof/note.htm

...which may go further to answering miekal's question "Best of who's net?" than anything about the contest winners. also, the submissions appear to be self-selecting, which greatly reduces any claim to "objectivity" that could be made on behalf of the process.

I'm putting together a special session for the Chicago MLA next year.  The
session will explore experimental writing in the Midwest from a critical
standpoint as it has emerged in the past twenty-five years.  As many of you
on this list could speak to this topic, I invite anyone who is interested to
send me an abstract of 250 words concerning your proposed topic.  I don't
have anything specific in mind, so I'm interested in seeing what people will
come up with from any "experimental" genre.  Please submit abstracts to
wallegre@iun.edu or backchannel.

from fogonazos:

The writing automaton

In the eighteenth century, 200 years before little ASIMO started to
walk or to climb stairs, the great Jaquet-Droz built an automaton
which could scrawl any sentence on a piece of paper and had a
chilling repertory of human-like movements. Read the story an then
check it out at the videos:

Completed by 1772, 'The Writer' was the most perfect and complex
automaton built by swiss clockmaker Jacquet-Droz. His astonishing
mechanism was presented in every court in Europe and fascinated the
world's most important people: the kings and emperors of China, India
and Japan.

What is fascinating to me about it is that Jaquet-Droz was a clockmaker. The
18th century vision of God was a clockmaker, who wound up the clock and left
it to run: therefore, the automaton as an image of the universe with traces
of the hand of God.

My guess is that the 18th century obsession with toys as replicas (as our
present obsession with computers and digital language?) has religious
implications.

Certainly metaphysical ones, although the implications go all different
ways.  Cf. Descartes, who likens the body to a clock, the implication
being that the body is mechanical but the mind is not; here the
"clockwork" idea supports Cartesian dualism.  If I recall correctly,
however, Baron d'Holbach also uses a clockwork metaphor in his monist
and mechanistic vision of human beings; here the clockwork metaphor
supports the view that there is no such thing as free will.  And of
course there's Hoffman's "The Sandman," which discounts the too-easy
idea of the humans as clockwork (various people mistake Olympia for a
human, but they're fools to do so), only to conclude that humans are
nevertheless driven by impulses beyond their control.  Etc.

I found Here, Bullet by Brian Turner very moving.  The title seems to call for the bullet to come to the speaker, come kill me, bullet, please take me out of this hell hole.  However, I wasn't completely satisfied with the title poem:  It drew attention to the location and place.  After that, I couldn't tell if Turner, a soldier, was pro- or anti-war.  In the Kamiya piece, the ending excerpt is a perfect example: sometimes the second person in a poem can refer to the first person, but I question whether that's the case with Turner.

  Still, a very powerful book, well-worth the read and all of the acolades it has received.

It is a little-appreciated irony that Turing devised the fundamental object
of the theory of computation--the Turing machine (he called it the
"a-machine")--in a successful effort to demonstrate the existence of tasks
for which no algorithm can possibly ever exist (humans are not necessarily
capable of such tasks either). In other words, he wanted to demonstrate the
existence of tasks that no machine will ever be capable of. When we pause
and reflect on what Turing set out to prove, we realize that, to do it, he
needs to devise a machine that *can do anything that any conceivable machine
can do* (which is a tall order), and then show that it can't do certain
tasks.

In devising the Turing machine, which was simply a means toward the proof,
he devised the fundamental theoretical object of which all contemporary
computers are instanstantiations. In demonstrating the existence of certain
tasks that the machine is incapable of, he solved Hilbert's
'Entscheidungsproblem' ('decision problem'), one of the most famous
mathematical problems of the day.

So is The Writing Automaton a computer? The question can be rethought this
way: is it capable of anything that a Turing machine is capable of? If it
is, it is said to be 'Turing complete' (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness ).

This is a fascinating issue. I recently stopped shopping at a bookstore i quite like because the owner was loudly voicing the view that Howard Zinn was an unamerican communist who only told lies about america as he was selling a copy of A People's History of the United States to a young woman.

I won't give money to merchants who think they have a right to do that to their customers. Amazon included.

Hello!

I'm excited to announce the Buffalo Small Press Fair. Christopher Fritton &
I have been working diligently behind the scenes to set-up the space, now we
need people like you to populate it.

The Buffalo Small Press Fair is designed to bring together a plurality of
people in different veins of publishing: poetry, fiction, comics, graphic
design, politics, etc. for a one-day event March 31st at the beautiful
Karpeles Manuscript museum. Along with vendors, we will have an exhibit
provided by Michael Basinski of the SUNY Buffalo Poetry & Rare Books Library
highlighting Buffalo's small press history. There is also space for possible
round-tables, forums and the like, so if that interests you too, please let
either myself or Christopher Fritton know.

The website <http://buffalosmallpress.org/> is complete enough for you to
get an overview and perhaps answer some questions you may have.

What else? We are looking for vendors. You can fill this out
online<http://www.buffalosmallpress.org/participate/vendor-application/>
<http://www.buffalosmallpress.org/participate/vendor-application/>and even
pay through PayPal if you wish.

Please forward this email to any interested parties--our scope currently is
regional (Ohio, up through Toronto, Syracuse to the east & Pittsburgh to the
south--give or take).

Also occuring that weekend (starting Thursday, running through Saturday)
will be the second Electric City Spectacular. Last year's event saw numerous
artists reading, performing & screening films. Saturday night's event will
likely be at the Karpeles Manuscript museum also, making for quite a
day-trip.

Thank you in advance for your support,

Chris & Kevin

Is it out yet? They had it on pre-order at MLA. I LOVE The Night--or at least the excerpt I read of it in the journal No a couple of issues back.

Beautiful Enemies: Friendship and Postwar=20
American Poetry (Oxford University Press, 2006)

Although it has long been commonplace to imagine=20
the archetypal American poet singing a solitary=20
=93Song of Myself,=94 much of the most enduring=20
American poetry has actually been preoccupied=20
with the drama of friendship.  In this lucid and=20
absorbing study, Andrew Epstein argues that an=20
obsession with both the pleasures and problems of=20
friendship erupts in the =93New American Poetry=94=20
that emerges after the Second World War.  By=20
focusing on some of the most significant=20
postmodernist American poets =96 the =93New York=20
School=94 poets John Ashbery, Frank O=92Hara, and=20
their close contemporary Amiri Baraka =96 Beautiful=20
Enemies reveals a fundamental paradox at the=20
heart of postwar American poetry and culture: the=20
avant-garde=92s commitment to individualism and=20
nonconformity runs directly counter to its own=20
valorization of community and collaboration. In=20
fact, Epstein demonstrates that the clash between=20
friendship and nonconformity complicates the=20
legendary alliances forged by postwar poets,=20
becomes a predominant theme in the poetry they=20
created, and leaves contemporary writers with a=20
complicated legacy to negotiate.  Rather than=20
simply celebrating friendship and poetic=20
community as nurturing and inspiring, these poets=20
represent friendship as a kind of exhilarating,=20
maddening contradiction, a site of attraction and=20
repulsion, affinity and rivalry.

Challenging both the reductive critiques of=20
American individualism and the idealized, heavily=20
biographical celebrations of literary camaraderie=20
one finds in much critical discussion, this book=20
provides a new interpretation of the peculiar=20
dynamics of American avant-garde poetic=20
communities and the role of the individual within=20
them.  By situating his extensive and revealing=20
readings of these highly influential poets=20
against the backdrop of Cold War cultural=20
politics and within the context of American=20
pragmatist thought, Epstein uncovers the=20
collision between radical self-reliance and the=20
siren call of the interpersonal at the core of postwar American poetry.

  * * * *

=93Beautiful Enemies charts the fascinating=20
tensions between individual and community in the=20
New York poetry world of mid-century.  For=20
post-World War II poets, friendship was at once=20
the engine that made poetry come alive, and yet=20
it could also be confining and oppressive =96 the=20
source of competition as well as nourishment.=20
Andrew Epstein examines the role community played=20
in the forging of New York poetics =96 a poetics=20
that cannot be dissociated from its relation to=20
Cold War politics. His is a fascinating,=20
beautifully documented investigation, both of=20
individual poems and of the interlocking=20
friendships that animated their production.=94

-- Marjorie Perloff, author of Frank O'Hara: Poet Among Painters


=93In Beautiful Enemies, Andrew Epstein offers=20
exemplary Emersonian readings of the intricate=20
web connecting individual talent and collective=20
investment in the poetry and poetics of John=20
Ashbery, Frank O'Hara, and Amiri Baraka. Averting=20
the Cold War myth of the individual voice in the=20
wilderness of conformity, Epstein gives us voices=20
in conversation and conflict, suggesting that=20
resistance to agreement is at the heart of a=20
pragmatist understanding of literary community.=94

-- Charles Bernstein, Donald T. Regan Professor=20
of English, University of Pennsylvania

"The premise is simple-John Ashbery and Frank=20
O'Hara were frenemies, as were O'Hara and LeRoi=20
Jones (now Amiri Baraka)-but Florida State=20
University assistant professor Epstein handles it=20
with such care and intelligence, that his study=20
ends up revealing a great deal about the American=20
midcentury avant-garde. For those in the know,=20
the above two friendships won't be news, but=20
never before have they been presented in such=20
painstaking detail, backed by a wealth of letters=20
and readings of the poets' verse that are patient=20
in the explication, and in their refusal to draw=20
easy conclusions about the nature of the=20
relationships under discussion. Two opening=20
chapters offer an introduction to the avant-garde=20
as it functioned in American culture, and to its=20
Emersonian origins, followed by individual=20
chapters considering each of the three poets=20
(with close references to the other two, and to=20
many other poets and artists), and a final=20
summation of the many paradoxes and=20
contradictions encountered therein. Anyone with=20
an interest in the ways great poetry depends on=20
complex and extraordinary relationships will find=20
this book deeply rewarding."   -- Publishers Weekly

For those of you who follow the debate on the Armenian Genocide, Turkish
law 301 which makes it a crime to use the "G" word and "defame the Turkish
Republic, Hrank Dink, Armenian-Turkish editor of Argos was assassinated
this morning in Istanbul. We have direct connections with his group as
Taner Akcam, the leading Turkish historian who confirms the events of 1915
as Genocide is on our staff.


This is from New Anatolian but you can find a lot more on the web:


Prominent Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink murdered

(AP)
19 January 2007


Journalist Hrant Dink, one of the most prominent voices of Turkey's
Armenian community, was killed by a gunman Friday at the entrance to his
newspaper's offices, police said.

Dink, a 53-year-old Turkish citizen of Armenian descent, had gone on trial
numerous times for speaking out about the mass killings of Armenians by
Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the 20th century. He had received
threats from ultra-nationalists, who viewed him as a traitor.

Dink was a public figure in Turkey, and as the editor of the bilingual
Turkish-Armenian newspaper Agos, one of its most prominent Armenian
voices.

In his last column for Agos, Dink complained that he had become famous as
an enemy of Turks and wrote of threats against him. He said he had
received no protection from authorities despite his complaints.

"My computer's memory is loaded with sentences full of hatred and
threats," Dink wrote. "I am just like a pigeon ... I look around to my
left and right, in front and behind me as much as it does. My head is just
as active."

Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in a news conference after the
killing, vowed to catch those responsible and called the slaying an attack
on Turkey's unity.

Erdogan said he had appointed top officials from the justice and security
ministries to investigate the killing, and that two suspects had been
arrested in Istanbul. He gave no details on the suspects.

"Hrant's body is lying on the ground as if those bullets were fired at
Turkey," Can Dundar, also a journalist, told private NTV television.

Turkey's relationship with its Armenian community is fraught with tension,
controversy and painful memories of a brutal past.
Much of Turkey's once-sizeable Armenian population was driven out
beginning around 1915.

During World War I, as the Ottoman Turkish empire fought Russian forces,
some of the Armenian minority in eastern Anatolia sided with the Russians.

In May 1915, the Armenian minority, one or two million strong, was
forcefully deported and marched from the Anatolian borders towards Syria
and Mesopotamia (now Iraq). Many died en route.

Armenia says 1.5 million Armenians were killed in this period, either
through systematic massacres or through starvation.

It alleges that a deliberate genocide was carried out by the Ottoman
Turkish empire.

Turkey acknowledges that many Armenians died, but says Turks died too, and
that massacres were committed on both sides as a result of inter-ethnic
violence and the wider World War.

Dink had been convicted of trying to influence the judiciary in 2005 after
Agos ran stories criticizing a law making it a crime to insult Turkey, the
Turkish government or the Turkish national character.

The conviction was rare even in a country where trials of journalists,
academics and writers have become common. Most of the cases, including
that of Nobel Prize-winning novelist Orhan Pamuk last year, were either
dropped on a technicality or lead to acquittals.

Fehmi Koru, a columnist at the Yeni Safak newspaper, said the killing was
aimed at destabilizing Turkey.

"His loss is the loss of Turkey," Koru said. Dozens of other journalists,
many of them friends of Dink, publicly condemned the killing. Broadcasters
on CNN-Turk and NTV, two of the major news stations, called it "shameful,"
"saddening" and "embarrassing."

Dink was one of the three writers Int. PEN brought attention to on Nov. 15.
He was offered asylum so many places, but he wanted to speak out where he felt it was necessary.
An amazing person who reminds us all what we often take for granted.

********************************

Beautiful Enemies: Friendship and Postwar
American Poetry (Oxford University Press, 2006)

Although it has long been commonplace to imagine
the archetypal American poet singing a solitary
“Song of Myself,” much of the most enduring
American poetry has actually been preoccupied
with the drama of friendship.  In this lucid and
absorbing study, Andrew Epstein argues that an
obsession with both the pleasures and problems of
friendship erupts in the “New American Poetry”
that emerges after the Second World War.  By
focusing on some of the most significant
postmodernist American poets – the “New York
School” poets John Ashbery, Frank O’Hara, and
their close contemporary Amiri Baraka – Beautiful
Enemies reveals a fundamental paradox at the
heart of postwar American poetry and culture: the
avant-garde’s commitment to individualism and
nonconformity runs directly counter to its own
valorization of community and collaboration. In
fact, Epstein demonstrates that the clash between
friendship and nonconformity complicates the
legendary alliances forged by postwar poets,
becomes a predominant theme in the poetry they
created, and leaves contemporary writers with a
complicated legacy to negotiate.  Rather than
simply celebrating friendship and poetic
community as nurturing and inspiring, these poets
represent friendship as a kind of exhilarating,
maddening contradiction, a site of attraction and
repulsion, affinity and rivalry.

Challenging both the reductive critiques of
American individualism and the idealized, heavily
biographical celebrations of literary camaraderie
one finds in much critical discussion, this book
provides a new interpretation of the peculiar
dynamics of American avant-garde poetic
communities and the role of the individual within
them.  By situating his extensive and revealing
readings of these highly influential poets
against the backdrop of Cold War cultural
politics and within the context of American
pragmatist thought, Epstein uncovers the
collision between radical self-reliance and the
siren call of the interpersonal at the core of postwar American poetry.

  * * * *

“Beautiful Enemies charts the fascinating
tensions between individual and community in the
New York poetry world of mid-century.  For
post-World War II poets, friendship was at once
the engine that made poetry come alive, and yet
it could also be confining and oppressive – the
source of competition as well as nourishment.
Andrew Epstein examines the role community played
in the forging of New York poetics – a poetics
that cannot be dissociated from its relation to
Cold War politics. His is a fascinating,
beautifully documented investigation, both of
individual poems and of the interlocking
friendships that animated their production.”

-- Marjorie Perloff, author of Frank O'Hara: Poet Among Painters


“In Beautiful Enemies, Andrew Epstein offers
exemplary Emersonian readings of the intricate
web connecting individual talent and collective
investment in the poetry and poetics of John
Ashbery, Frank O'Hara, and Amiri Baraka. Averting
the Cold War myth of the individual voice in the
wilderness of conformity, Epstein gives us voices
in conversation and conflict, suggesting that
resistance to agreement is at the heart of a
pragmatist understanding of literary community.”

-- Charles Bernstein, Donald T. Regan Professor
of English, University of Pennsylvania

"The premise is simple-John Ashbery and Frank
O'Hara were frenemies, as were O'Hara and LeRoi
Jones (now Amiri Baraka)-but Florida State
University assistant professor Epstein handles it
with such care and intelligence, that his study
ends up revealing a great deal about the American
midcentury avant-garde. For those in the know,
the above two friendships won't be news, but
never before have they been presented in such
painstaking detail, backed by a wealth of letters
and readings of the poets' verse that are patient
in the explication, and in their refusal to draw
easy conclusions about the nature of the
relationships under discussion. Two opening
chapters offer an introduction to the avant-garde
as it functioned in American culture, and to its
Emersonian origins, followed by individual
chapters considering each of the three poets
(with close references to the other two, and to
many other poets and artists), and a final
summation of the many paradoxes and
contradictions encountered therein. Anyone with
an interest in the ways great poetry depends on
complex and extraordinary relationships will find
this book deeply rewarding."   -- Publishers Weekly


Andrew Epstein received his Ph.D. from Columbia
University and is currently an Assistant
Professor of English at Florida State
University.  His essays and reviews have appeared
in Raritan, Lingua Franca, Fulcrum, Contemporary
Literature and other journals, and his poems have
appeared in various journals, including
Cross-Connect, Conduit, Mississippi Review, Lungfull, and Verse.

Spring Workshops at the Poetry Project



The Poetry School Of Poetry =AD  Douglas Rothschild
Tuesdays at 7 Pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 13th

Writing  poetry is difficult; writing good poetry, more difficult still. In
this  workshop, we will focus on exactly what we think is good in a poem &
determine how our senses of aesthetics inform our responses to this
question. Working within our own aesthetic notions we will then begin to
refine our  writing, & help each other to write the best poems that we can.
The workshop  will conduct a number of actual experiments with writing that
will allow us to  step outside the world of id, which wants to keep all the
beautiful words,  & into the artistic self, which understands which pieces
fit & which  belong elsewhere. We will also engage the basic Poetry School
of Poetry premise  that the poet=B9s first job is to learn how to edit. Dgls
N. Rthschld has been  behind the foods table at the New Years Reading more
times than it is worth  mentioning. He has also written a number of
chapbooks, the most ground breaking  entitled The Minor Arcane.  He has
taught what seem to be innumerable college writing classes, and is
currently teaching at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, a CUNY
school.=20


The Visible Unseen: Writing Outside Borders =AD Akilah Oliver
Thursdays at 7 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 15th

Are  poetry and prose virtual realities, simulations of something other, or
the real  thing? Where does the =B3I=B2  live? How many moments exist in  the
moment of the line? What  borders of form are crucial for us to hang on to =
&
which boundaries are  collapsible? In this workshop, we  will explore the
connections and tensions between the visible and the unseen  world/s, not a=
s
dualities or binaries, but as complementary sites of  composition. Through
engagement with text (written and visual), public spaces, the imagination,
dreams and Eros, participants are invited to think of writing as that which
re-imagines the known and the unknown. Though this is a text based workshop=
,
poets, prose writers, and artists from all disciplines are welcome. Reading=
s
include: Giorgio Agamben, Laura Mullen, Whitman, Anne Waldman, Derrida, &
Ben Okri. Akilah Oliver is the  author of the she said dialogues: flesh
memory, An Arriving Guard of Angels, Thusly  Coming to Greet, a(A)gust, &
The Putterer=B9s Notebook. She is faculty at the Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics Summer  Writing Program at Naropa University.


Impurity  Rocks! A Poetry Lab & Workshop =AD Joanna Fuhrman
Fridays at 7 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 16th

The class will focus on  =B3impure=B2 poetry, poetry that employs a mixture of
tones and styles. Special  emphasis will be placed on works that combine
narrative and humor with  linguistic and imagistic disjunction. In-class
exercises and take-home assignments  will touch on issues of scale, space,
sound, genre and wordplay. Time will also  be devoted to reading published
poems as well as in-depth discussions and  critiques of student work. Joann=
a
Fuhrman is the author of three collections of  poetry, Freud in Brooklyn,
Ugh Ugh Ocean and Moraine, all published by Hanging Loose Press. She has
taught poetry  writing at The University of Washington, The Cooper Union
Saturday Outreach  program and in the New York City Public Schools.


Poetry  For The Page, Stage, And Computer Screen =AD Thomas Savage
Saturdays At 12 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 17th

This  course is a writing workshop where students' writing is the main
focus.  Also used as inspiration and writing prompts will be samples of wor=
k
by  writers from The Beats, Black Mountain poets, The New York School (all
generations), Language Poetry, Poets Theater, Pablo Neruda, and works being
published today online, among other sources. Practices will include  readin=
g
as well as writing assignments and, in a great Poetry Project tradition,
in-class writing. Thomas Savage has written eight published books of  poems
including most recently Bamiyan Poems, Brain Surgery Poems and Political
Conditions/Physical  States. His poems  have appeared in many print and
online venues including The New York Times, Hanging Loose, Rattapallax, Big
Bridge, Black Box, and regularly on the Wryting-L website. He has taught
poetry  workshops at The Poetry Project and Tribes Gallery.

Those of you who have listened to me ramble about projects have probably
heard me reference over and over a book on Virgil that Garin Cycholl and I
want to create.  Well, Garin and I are finally going to put this book
together.  We are trying to edit a book of responses, both creative and
critical, to Virgil's The Georgics.  Both of us are open to the type of
response-it can even be very loosely related to Virgil's work, so I invite
all of you to read Virgil and type up a response to it.  Send your responses
to wallegre@iun.edu.



Best,

Bill Allegrezza

Here is a different sort of poetry: http://gherban.free.fr . This is
Alexandre Gherban's site (France). You don't have to understand French to
enjoy this work. I was particularly taken with the work "la colonie". This
is a collection of 14 Shockwave pieces. Some are interactive, some are not.
Most, if not all, are audio-visual. These works mostly proceed by symbols
moving around and interacting with each other. Sometimes you can affect that
motion and interaction. It gives a sense of the interaction of symbols in a
way different language to produce meaning.

Of "la colonie", Alexandre Gherban says:

“The colony” is made up of a collection of small automata having various
artistic “functions”. The sounds come from my voice; phonemes are used to
produce sound sequences in real time."

Alexandre is one of the organizers of the upcoming e-poetry conference in
Paris (see http://paragraphe.univ-paris8.fr/epoetry ).

Settling among prairie leaves, I am anxious for those

packing Sunday parties, outside of Milwaukee,
organized by old (gay) Mr. Hug-a-vet. And am looking
to do some readings - "make contact" - to go those
places where honest (i.e., without the burden of

i hope by scapegoats you don't just mean famous and benign "martyrs."
a lot of the "bad guys" like saddam hussein, lyndie england, etc.,
are also symptoms of systemic violence, etc.

For literature, also, any of Genet's novels.

LITERARY BUFFALO
1.22.07-1.28.07

Dear E-Newsletter Recipient,

Over the past couple of years, Just Buffalo has been collaborating with Tal=
king Leaves...Books, Medaille College, Rust Belt Books, Starcherone Books, =
The Burchfield-Penney Art Center, Canisius College, Hallwalls, Exhibit X Fi=
ction, Slope Editions and The David Gray Chair if Poetry and Letters at SUN=
Y Buffalo to produce the Literary Buffalo poster and website.  Our goal is =
to give Buffalo a sense of the incredible quantity and diversity of literar=
y happenings every month in the Nickel City and environs.  To that end, we =
have been including a =22Literary Buffalo=22 section at the bottom of each =
Just Buffalo e-newsletter, which tries to include all these events and othe=
rs that could not fit on the poster.  As of today, we are changing both the=
 name and the format of the newsletter to Literary Buffalo, in order to bet=
ter reflect this collaboration.

Events will now be listed in chronological order by date at the top of the =
newsletter.  Following these listings will be the usual information about J=
ust Buffalo workshops and Membership, as well as information about how to u=
nsubscribe. We hope very soon to create a part of our website that will giv=
e access to literary event planners who want their event listed on our elec=
tronic calendar and also in the e-newsletter.  For now, if you want an even=
t listed in this e-newsletter, please send me an email with all the relevan=
t information.  We only list events in the Western New York region, and we =
only list events during the week the event takes place during the week of t=
he newsletter.  That covers Monday through Sunday each week. As there are m=
any literary events to attend to, I highly recommend that, if you are not a=
 sponsoring organization of Literary Buffalo, you remind me via email on Su=
nday night or Monday morning about your event, as they sometimes slip throu=
gh the cracks.

Anyhow, Happy New Year, and keep reading for this week's Literary Buffalo E=
vents.

ge, poetic form, editing and revising, and finally bringing work into the w=

le lesson on the subject of that day's class.

Scapegoating has happened to me, in many small ways, in social situations with other poets over the years but mostly in the past.  I assume that I was being scapegoated for telling the truth when it made other poets whom I then knew uncomfortable.

here's something based on the original sense of the "scapegoat,"
Azazel....


throw Azazel back where it came from. tie its horns with string
the people are excellent. they need something to die for them

let it fall on sharp rocks. throw the goat back into the wilderness=20
and the blood washes in some lonely place. red string turned white

Scapegoating has happened to me, in many small ways, in social
situations with other poets over the years but mostly in the past.  I
assume that I was being scapegoated for telling the truth when it made
other poets whom I then knew uncomfortable.

It isn't a poem, but Ursula LeGuin's short story "The Ones Who Walked
Away From Omelas" is a great study of scapegoating- now there's a
verb for you! I use it to talk about social ethics with my
engineering bound students. As well there is always always Shirley
Jackson's "The Lottery".

Scapegoat is usually a belated title. Scapegoat Jesus' statement about
nobody being a prophet in his hometown probably applies to scapegoats
too. If I were to suggest that Bush and the Neocons are scapegoats for
the larger failures of government, the usual outrage would follow.


Here's a fine poem on the Academy of American Poets site:

"The Goat"   	
by Aaron Fogel

If you are a goat, do you believe

What people tell you about

Goats, and eat

Tin cans?

There’s no goat that foolish.

Or is there?

The goat of the universe believed

What people told him about universes

And came into existence.

Bang!  How naive can you get?

Even the scapegoat is not as naive

As (God help him) the universe that

Agreed to exist.

A word to the wise: Don’t eat tin cans.

Don’t listen. Don’t exist.

and don't forget the (alleged) etymology of "tragedy" :

tragedy=20
    c.1374, "play or other serious literary work with an unhappy
ending," from O.Fr. tragedie (14c.), from L. tragedia "a tragedy," from
Gk. tragodia "a dramatic poem or play in formal language and having an
unhappy resolution," apparently lit. "goat song," from tragos "goat" +
oide "song." The connection may be via satyric drama, from which tragedy
later developed, in which actors or singers were dressed in goatskins to
represent satyrs. But many other theories have been made (including
"singer who competes for a goat as a prize"), and even the "goat"
connection is at times questioned. Meaning "any unhappy event, disaster"
is from 1509.

I think Neo-ons and Bush will be the scapeboats of each other.

What is the relationship of scapegoat to martyr? No one is a martyr out of
his own hometown?

So, to some, if the pro-war or anti-war stance of the poem is not clear then
the poem (or is it poet?) is ... ?

It wasn't a lover's spat
wonder if anything's real

I'm tired of what corpses do!

 Issue #2:

Corey Antis: "1:1"

When I decided to start mapping my studio, I discovered that there were
plenty of models available to serve as references.

Joel Bettridge: "Reading Hurts - Masochism and Lip Service as a Tortured
Text"

"Bruce Andrews is not a poet," a professor to whom I had shown
Andrews's *Getting
Ready To Have Been Frightened* as an undergraduate told me.

of a sleeping lady and twitch....

In the archives:

Issue #1

Nancy Kuhl: "Room 26: The Discrete Notions Exhibit"

The Room 26 Discrete Notions exhibition series features individual artworks
and objects that observe, celebrate, critique, and document cultural
phenomena. Beginning in the spring of 2004 and changing several times a
year, the series includes made and found artworks, verbo-visual
commentaries, cultural documents, and literary and artistic records.

Melissa Lenos: "We need another hero... Our contemporary gunslinger,
Supernanny"

We begin with a troubled family, terrorized and unable to manage their
surroundings. A stranger arrives =96 seemingly out of nowhere - with no pas=
t
and no personal details. The family is suspicious of the stranger at first,
but once they've accepted this mysterious person into their home, they
recognize that he has skills that would be useful to them. The stranger
teaches the family to cope with their difficulties, remains for a final
battle and then departs into the sunset alone.

Jean Smith: "In the end he says, 'Attraction is ephemeral.'"

Mistrust -- a flashing neon sign -- trust / do not trust =96 perhaps becaus=
e
we got together so fast. I feel comfortable with him. I am just being me an=
d
he seems to like me. In our Lavalife profiles we both express the idea for =
a
lover -- not a relationship -- and then we just began to get close. Maybe
because neither of us expected to find anything other than lover online. He
doesn't want me to change. He wants to get to know me. Seems crazy about me=
.
I am being myself. He laughs at what I say -- I laugh at what I say. He
says, "Nowhere on all your websites and interviews did I read that you are
lovely, funny and sexy as hell." If it could stay like this; but if it
doesn't, I don't think I will be crushed. This part feels good too.

Dear Murat, I believe a martyr is someone who chooses or accepts the fate of his suffering, often leading to death, whereas a scapegoat has no choice about being subjected to the negative actions or statements of others.  How this applies to Bush, I can't imagine, since he clearly deserves whatever negative reaction comes his way at this point.  He and the Neo-Cons can consume each other for all I care, as long as they disappear.  Regards, Tom Savage

What is the relationship of scapegoat to martyr? No one is a martyr out of
his own hometown?

Ciao,

Murat

AlbanyPoets will celebrate the 2nd Anniversary of the monthly open mic,
Poets Speak Loud, at Tess' Lark Tavern on Monday, January 29, 7:00 PM.
The celebratioin will also mark the 2nd Anniversary of the passing of
Tom Nattell to star dust.  Tom was an Albany poet and activist who was
scheduled to be the first featured poet at Poets Speak Loud on January
31, 2005.  However Tom died of cancer that morning, so the reading
turned into an impromptu memorial celebration, with a march to nearby
Washington Park to place a beret upon the head of the statue of Robert
Burns, the site of Poets in the Park each July.  On this Monday we will
continue that tradition with the 3rd Annual Beret Toss.
Poets Speak Loud is held on the last Monday of each month at Tess' Lark
Tavern on Madison Ave., in Albany, NY, starting at 7:00 PM.  The usual
host is Mary Panza; for the 2nd Anniversary celebration the host will
be Dan Wilcox.  For more information check out www.albanypoets.com.
Peace,
DWx

Dear Tom,

What I mean by it that who is called a martyr in the Islamic work is called
a terrorist here.

Bush and Neo-cons being each others' scapegoats, each will blame the other
for the iraq catastrophe.

Hi Murat, I appreciate your clarification.  As to the word "martyr", I was thinking of Christian martyrs.  I don't know why since there aren't any anymore.  Nevertheless...As for the distinction, verbally, of Muslim terrorists and martyrs, they still seem terrorists to me since their aim, after killing, is to inspire fear.There martyrdom, too, is somewhat nonsensical to me since there is probably no subset of Heaven waiting just for them solely because they've killed people and died as their own self-inflicted collateral damage.  Regards, Tom Savage

Murat: What I mean by it that who is called a martyr in the Islamic work
is called a terrorist here.


And rightly so, because their martyrdom involves the murder of innocents.

In the Christian worldview, however, martyrs often submit to death
rather than renounce their religion. They die but do not kill others.
The Catholic Church even has a martyrology for these types.

Civil rights martyrs usually do not kill others either. Stephen Biko and
Martin Luther King were killed without killing others; John Brown
however was a violent exception.

Martyrs for science, like Bruno or Galileo, do not kill innocents either.

A lot of new work has come out in the last week or so -- I'm enjoying it at
a clip, in particular UnlikelyStories 2.0: The Cross-Media Issue and
collaborations in Sugar Mule.  Now broadsides and experimental  chapbooks and ars
poetica.  Appreciating those in my office with  its desktop is going well.  Trying
to read fiction at home, in bed, is  not going very well at all -- I avoid
the cozy room where physical books  surround my bed in wait for me.  Books by
fiction authors that I bought or  checked out of the library -- all due or
recalled before I can get to  them.  In one of the greatest bookstore moments of my
life, I recently  bought the collected Chekhov (Ecco) and began with volume 1
(of 13).  "The  Darling" is how far I got, but I had already read it.  That
is followed by  an essay by Tolstoy about women, called "Tolstoy's Criticism on
'The Darling',"  not to be missed!  I ended up snubbing George Orwell (Down
and Out in  Paris and London) like neglecting to meet a train.  Then it gets
worse -- this reading of books -- I go to the cafe and can only read a
minimalist there, one crouton at a time.  My three Emily Dickinsons are in  storage,
but the boxed biography is here.  My Collected H.D. is at his house, a
thousand miles away.  Then I get E.D. and H.D. out of the  library and read and want
to quote and forget the other books.  Then I read  at poets.org for a week.  I
mean to but forget to get the Collected  May Swenson from the library, but I
read her online.  Then I go back to  The Cross-Media Issue and see how much
there still is to see and  try to buy an item at eBay for Rain Taxi, but the
auction must  be over.  Then I read the Norman Mailer article at the kitchen
table  while eating beans.

yes, the raintaxi auction is over. someone i don't even know bought my
shawl.  my fear is that she's just bought it for the yarn, and will
unravel the whole thing so as to re-use the materials.  but it's beyond
my control.  oh well. am i more than a bit paranoid? most likely.
charming post, anyway.

A martyr is also a person who sacrifices themself for a cause--greater than
themself--their people, their homeland, their spiritual belief, political
belief--
many "suicide bombers" die not for themselves,  but for their people--the
Palestinain people for example--for a homeland--is dying for a cause--
Malcolm X, Martin Luther King--knew they could be killed for their
causes--and were willing to die for them--
"terrorists" can't be lumped into one vast stereotype--
there are many differing motivations and contexts worldwide and within
supposedly homogeneous groups for these acts--many of them secular as much
as having anything to do with religion--
think what point of despair and sense of helplessness a person is driven to
when their only weapon is their life--if you get shot for throwing a
rock--what are you supposed to do?--climb into ever and ever smaller
holes?--put yourself in such a position and think of how you might respond--
or of prisoners, planning a prison break--
simone weil wrote in her essay on "the illiad: poem of force" writes that
force is the x which turns any person into a thing
people subjected to daily lives of nothing but coercion, imprisonment,
taking away of food and water, medical supplies, schools--at certain
point--are reminded continualy and only that they are things--
to approach the oppressor, come up close as a human being and be for a
moment announcing that one is not a thing, one is a human--and to blow both
up--as humans--is to say to the other--i am not a thing, for all you have
done to me i am a person--and you, too are a person--so will kill you in
person, to person--
the true terror is that the thing took on a human face and came forward--and
killed you and themself as humans--
not things
golda meir told the BBC in 1969 "there never was any suich thing as a
Paelstinain"--
not any such people or nation--any such thing--
the Indians in this country wiped out, their lands settled and they forced
to live in reservations in conditions unfit for wild animals in many
cases----were thought of as things--without a nation or history or culture
--they never had a government or flag and so forth--things--non-things--
this  doesnt apply maybe to many suicide bombers but it does to ones i have
read accounts of their beliefs, their lives, their action--
they weren't brainwashed zombies or fanatics thinking about heaven--
they were top students, hard working people--who examined their situation
and came to a decision
terrorists are always called this if on the other side--
American Indians in the American Indian Movement have been called this for
example--"terrorists"--
eco-terrorists--
when you read history books flat out Ben-Gurion and Began are called
"terrorists" and they were--
but people who died with them I am sure are called martyrs also--as were
fighting for their cause--
for some reason it is considered more barbaric to be forced to use a human
bomb--
than to use, as the talk is being done now, of using a nuke bomb--
or of the millions of cluster bombs dropped on Lebanon--
that is considered "more human" than "inhuman" suicide bombing--
the logic of this escapes one--
Murat's point is a very good one--very important to keep in mind--from what
persepective, and also with how much knowledge and thought, one considers
things, they are of course quite different--one has to try to understand
these questions from both or however many sides one  possibly can--otherwise
one gets caught up in the same kind of twisted thinking which leads to these
events in the first place--
was John Brown a terrorist or a martyr?  he has been seen and written about
both ways--
Thoreau who wrote the great essay on civil Disobediance was also a great
suporter and admirer of John Brown--
Sherman Alexie wrote : Oh! American that freedom loving country where
Americans killed Americans over the right to have slaves. oh! oh!"
from one side of the conflict, Lincoln was a great martyr--from the other--a
monster--
there are many parts of the world where in one village a person is called a
martyr but in the next one, they are reviled as the worst of scapegoats--
Che Guevara considered as a martyr--and this immensely accentuated in the
famous Christ-like photos of him lying stretched out after death surrounded
by Bolivan army and police--
for example many people consider John lennon a martyr--
and in terms of scapegoats--
there is the Kenneth rexroth poem about Dylan Thomas being killed basically
by others--the poet destroyed by the public--
and the great piece by Artaud--"Van Gogh or The Man Suicided by Society"--
many artits stars in music and film for example are considered in ways that
border on martyrdom--
marilyn monroe, james dean, jimi hendrix janis joplin, tuapc basquiat,
pollock, kerouac, all have had auras of a formof martyrdom attached to
them--many many more then these
charlie parker and billie holiday too--
in Milwaukee we have the Black Holocaust Museum--a place of martyrs killed
by terrorists--even in very recent years--the man dragged to death by chains
from a pickup truck in Texas--
the martyrdom of the young gay man left Christ like also hanging on a
fence--
there is a great deal to think about and find out about before one passes
judgement--especially on stereotyped images promulagated against enemies in
war time--
btw--strindberg wrote a great novel called The Scapegoat--the scapegoat is a
theme a lotof his work expores--this the most explicit example
there are also the films of Lars von Trier--the trilogy esp--with Dancer
inthe Dark, Dogville and my bad i forget nameof the first one--very much
films on the scapegoat theme--

Skip,

Thanks--looks like it's a problem with the way IE renders CSS, I'll
find a workaround. (http://www.webcredible.co.uk/user-friendly-resources/cs=

In the meantime, if you try it using a standards-compliant browser

Eric,

Do you remember the Buddhist(s) monk who set himself to fire during the
Vietnam War? Was he a martyr or a terrorist?

I do not want to defend the killing of innocents. I do not want to defend
killing at all, and I think all senses of martyr contain glorifications of
death. Martyrdom is often used as very potent political weapon, and how it
is defined changes with the point of view.

Ciao,

Murat.

Tempted to ask - 20 minutes before the new fiction - is, given some of the
arguments here -  whether or not George Bush is a martyr for not already
killing himself. He's clearly got practically a whole country, if not entire
world, against him and his belief system. He's clearly got a cause that he
is not willing to renounce. There is an aspect of him - it's long appeared -
that would rather go down in flames(dragging the nation with him) rather
than submit to any dialog, negotiation. change, and/or transformation. One
wonders what's holding him back??  Karl Rove? Cheney?
Maybe he, Rove and Cheney have defined a a new category, "Living Martyr."
Thanks a lot, George!!

O well!

metrical forms of the apocalypse

http://www.asondheim.org/metrical.mp3 (tabla)

"It is not, again, "what is to be done," but "what is the doing." And it
is insufficient to abjure the doing, as in the notion there can be no
lyric poetry, perhaps no poetry, after the Holocaust, that other holocaust
that continues in yet other forms. This bypasses, not only doing, but
thinking that may yet reveal another dawn in the midst of dusk. One might
say in return, all dawns are ruptured. The day is ruptured by the night.
What remains, what is never ruptured: ground zero - one might say the
substance of ground zero, but here there is no divisibility; one fails and
falters with the other."

Makes me think of the Rauschenberg piece, "Erased DeKooning."

Hopefully that will make you feel better about any potential use of your
shawl.

yes, the raintaxi auction is over. someone i don't even know bought my
shawl.  my fear is that she's just bought it for the yarn, and will
unravel the whole thing so as to re-use the materials.  but it's beyond
my control.  oh well. am i more than a bit paranoid? most likely.
charming post, anyway.

Stephen,

Exactly! George may think he is a martyr. The last refuge of an obstinate
mule, martyrdom.

By NEIL A. LEWIS
I. Lewis Libby Jr.'s lawyer asserted that Mr. Libby was made a scapegoat by White House officials to protect Karl Rove.

David,
I suppose I'm as confused as anybody about all this,
but:
A useful comparison for understanding why the suicide
bomber is misguided might be found in the figure of
the Resistant, with which the suicide bomber is
constantly (wrongly, and to my constant dismay)
conflated. The Resistant targets military forces and
infrastructure to combat oppression. He believes in
the possibility of a future without oppression. The
suicide bomber has a vision of despair (I am following
your own description of the figure): he sees no
possible future, with or without oppression, and he
targets civilians ("for all you have done to me": who?
the civilians of Israel? many have reprehensible
beliefs, yes, and many may have been part of horrible
military action *in the past*, but destroying them now
accomplishes nothing, and produces hate and fear). He
despairs: put another way, he submits utterly to the
force of oppression, by reducing himself and others to
*things* in an another horrible way. He is not a
fighter, even symbolically, he is not a Resistant. He
has admitted his total defeat by symbolically staging
his own destruction.
The defense of the Palestinian people, and/or
opposition to Israel, does not have to include a
defense of suicide bombers, whether or not they are
religious fanatics (who are, in any event, rarely the
raving lunatics we imagine them to be), and, I argue,
should not. That we should heed the call for help, as
misled and perverted as it is, seems obvious and
urgent. But from there to defending their actions...?
I know you'll realize that everything I write "sourd
de bon, franc et loyale courage..."!
Amities,
Alex

Dear Alex:

Oh--I am not defending their actions.
I agree with you--a resistance would be to blow up communication centers,
police stations, air ports, government buildings,water purification plants,
electricity generators bridges, etc.
But then that often causes "collateral damage" also.
I can't fathom why suicide bombing is done, so have tried to find out the
point of view for it.  I read that it was introduced to the Palestinains by
a member of the Japanese Red Army in late 1960's as the Japanese have used
suicide bombing in the past--the kamikaze pilots of World War 2.  These of
course, targeted Naval Forces and their accompanying supply ships, not
civilians.  (Though Japanese civilians were being fire bombed at the time).
(At the very end of the war the Germans also used some suicide planes.)
On the other hand, Andre Breton wrote that the ultimate Surrealist act would
to be to go into a crowd and start firing a revolver.
I saw recently on cable an American film from the 1940's, a wartime drama
set in the Phillipies.  Towards the fiilm's end, in order for the fleeing
Americans, nurses with wounded mainly, to have a chance for a dash for
esacpe, one of the nurses advances by herself towards the Japanese, offering
herself up they think to be taken in the worst senses of the word.  (The
nurses have been warned about what the Japanese did to female prisoners
trhoughut Asia.)  The nurses wlaks staright into the large Japanese
advance--and detonates herself.  The rest of the Americans are given enough
time to make their getaway.
Since this nurse's fiance had been killed at Pearl Harbor, her motivations
are not just self-sacrifice--she is eager to avenge his death and her grief
on the hated Japanese. She is n't blowing up civilians, but it was
interesting to see in an American film the use of a suicide bomber in this
way, and how the motivations were worked out.
I agree with you that this is a very self deafting strategy and seems
incomprehensible.  That's why I keep trying to figure out what it is maybe
impossible to if one is not in that culture and situation.
A friend of mine, a 54 year old man at the time, a harmless chizophrenic wh
used to wlak around holding by turns a Bible or a Koran in his cupped hands,
was beaten to death in front of the building where he lived--I used to live
inthe same building, about three blocks from where I live now.  The killing
was done by a group of ten boys, the oldest of whom was thriteen.  Only half
of them have ever been caught.  Especailly in summer time, there are groups
of young boys, theoldest barely in their teens, who walk the treets with
baseball bats and other wepons.  When they find someone defenseless, they
attack.  They have no concept and no fear even when a slight one, of having
to spend the rest of their lives perhaps in prison.  They are filled with
rage and at the same a strange lack of affect, a kind of contradiction.
Interviews with many children and teens who have committed such crimes find
extreme rage about the dehumanization of their environment and at ame time
that the dehumanization has sunk so far in, killing innocent people doesnt'
register as anything extraordinary at all. They feel there isno value to
their lives, so there is no value in others'. Intead of channelingrage into
a "productive" idea of wanting to grow up to change society, there is the
self-defeating desire to wreack revenge in the here and now--not at the
powerful, like blowing up a police station or acts of resistance--but at
innocents, who cant' defend thmselves.  The contempt they have for weakness
may be that they see themselves in weakness, their postion, and hate that,
so in a group need to get rid of the sight which reminds them ofthemselves.
Those are just theories people work on, trying to understand what drives
these attacks as they grow more and more frequent.
If you grown up in society in which violence is 24/7 and rage about your
defencelessness is all consuming from a very very early age,  it seems one
is a fertile planting ground for wanting to respond in some extreme manner,
not in an organized, strategic one neccesarily at all, but a striking out
and rage for revenge.
Again, these are only theories.  It is often pointed out that a culture of
violence surrounds youngpeople in their dialy lives and in the media also
all around one.  Violence seems to be the solution toeverything.  The only
things keeping some form of lid on it are the police on theon hand and gangs
n the other, or drug dealers and their assorted quasi-militia and kids who
are basically their eyes and ears on the ground so to speak.
Introduce drugs to the equation, and that becomes another way of controlling
people, keeping them in a self defeating situation.
there are also the huge number  of killings every year in which a man takes
his family hostage, or simply surprises them in the night--and shoots them
all and then himself.  Or the columbine style killers.
The culture of revenge is very strong motivation also--the eye for an eye of
the Bible.  A person is killed on one side--so--then x number have to be
killed on the oher. Which calls for another response, back and forth
forever.
I 'm not defending these actions at all.  I don't know what it will take to
stop the insnaity, especially because of the "eye for an eye" mentality.
I've tried to understand it but I think not being a part of the culture and
situation I can't.  Since I see the self destructiveness of the part of the
world I live in, I've tried to understand what goes into creating it.  What
happned to the movements of resistance of thrity years ago?  I think in the
United States a lot of it is drugs, and that the supply of drugs is always
increasing, and targets first the same areas.  Malcolm X was the first
American leader to speak out agsint drugs, much more passionately than any
leader has since.
However, people can be fed other things as a form of drug--via propaganda,
become addicted to hate and revenge on both sides until there is no room for
any form of thought other than the irrationality of extreme emotions kept
continually at the highest pitch.
9/11 showed this revenge effect happening in the United Satets, people who
had seemed rational suddenly screaming for blood and the government
continually ratcheting up the alerts and fears as much as possible.
Thank you very much for your letter Alex.
Suicide also I was thinking--used to be a big question when Camus wrote
about it, of course that is individual suicide, wihout killng others.
Though the context is different in many ways, I realized that Franz Fanon
might be a very interesting and useful writer to read again now.
I did see a brief interview with a Palestinain psychiatrist who has sutdied
over a thousand children and he said the effects on these childen of the
lives they lead is something which has already in a sense made them feel as
though they are dead already.  There's no sense of a future, or hope, or
anything, the damge is incalcuable.  You think of "the land of opporutnity"
the kids here grow up in supposedly--but many live with another version of
this kind of zero horiizon to life.  Life has no value so it isn't much
trouble at all to want to smash it to peices, your won and someone esle's
out of rage and revenge and fear and many other things sunk deep inside the
being.
Thank you again Alex.  Since one lives in such a world, there's a desre t
try to understand and many things--very hard to if at all.
Oh I did think of Joan of Arc--a martyr, a Saint and a military leader. This
puzzled me no end as a child until I lived in France,of course!  She was
burned at the stake the same year Francois Villon was born.  I think Villon
is one of the greatest poets for preseniting such a range of understandings
and at same time the knwoeldge and at the same time "I know everything but
myself". On the one hand extreme vioelnce--he did kill a Preist in self
defense it was ruled--was tortured, imprisoned, twice about to hang and
reprieved at the last moment--and at the same time writes of compassion,
love, mercy, tenderness.  There is a great joy and at the same time a deep
sense of fatalism--"I cheer up in sad despair".
To me he is a continual companion for moving through a wrold of such
violence and such beauty simultaneously.  If one could impart the ability to
be in the midst of things and at the same time have a form of distance
within oneself to recongize the possibilities of something else which is
right in front of one, in n matter how abused a state,  instead of the
hatred and revenge, that seems a way to cope with a  situation and find a
way towards peace.
A poet friend yesterday told me he had a sense of "optimistic fatalism"--I
thought this put it very well!

Murat, the Buddhist monk who set himself on fire during the Vietnam War probably would not have considered himself a martyr though in some sense you could argue that he was.  A larger issue for me is whether his act was a suicide or not, since suicide is prohibited in Buddhism. For an interesting and  convincing discussion of all of this I would refer you to a book by the eminent Vietnamese Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh.  Unfortunately, I don't remember which of his many books it was in which I read this.  But the author argues fairly successfully, if I remember correctly, that this act was not a suicide.  If anyone reading this who knows could supply the name of this book in which this is discussed it might facilitate any discussion of whether that monk's actions were martyrdom or not.

I do not want to defend the killing of innocents. I do not want to defend
killing at all, and I think all senses of martyr contain glorifications of
death. Martyrdom is often used as very potent political weapon, and how it
is defined changes with the point of view.

Ciao,

I am working on putting together an anthology of 20th and 21st century ekphrastic poetry (poetry about visual art) from the U.S. I am now beginning the daunting process of assembling a list of poems to be considered for the anthology. I don't have a publisher yet, but once I have assembled the anthology I am going to try to find one.

I am hoping you can take a moment and list any ekphrastic poems you can think of and backchannel to mark_lamoureux@yahoo.com with the subject heading "Ekphrastic Poems." The only criteria are that the poet be one who has published in the 20th or 21st centuries. I am limiting the scope to published poems in an attempt to control the size of the project a little bit.

I am hoping to display the poem side-by-side with the image (or an image of the work in the case of sculpture) that the poem is about; so the poems should be about works of art that I could hypothetically obtain an image of.

Thanks in advance,
Mark Lamoureux

 >>Eric, Do you remember the Buddhist(s) monk who set himself to fire
during the Vietnam War? Was he a martyr or a terrorist?

If you are referring to the iconic 1963 photo, a martyr protesting the
Dem government's religious persecution of Buddhists.

A terrorist can make others martyrs -- as the terrorists on Flight 93
did --- but only in the special Islamic sense (fighting to bring
dar-al-harb into dar-al-Islam) can a terrorist also be a martyr.

Below are some coordinate terms from Princeton's WordNet program.


2 senses of martyr

Sense 1
martyr, sufferer -- (one who suffers for the sake of principle)
     -> victim -- (an unfortunate person who suffers from some adverse
circumstance)
        => casualty, injured party -- (someone injured or killed in an
accident)
        => casualty -- (someone injured or killed or captured or missing
in a military engagement)
        => hunted person -- (a person who is hunted)
        => martyr, sufferer -- (one who suffers for the sake of principle)
        => martyr -- (one who voluntarily suffers death as the penalty
for refusing to renounce their religion)
        => muggee -- (a victim of a mugging; "the law seems to give more
protection to the mugger than to the muggee")
        => murderee -- (a victim who is murdered)
        => poor devil, wretch -- (someone you feel sorry for)
        => prey, quarry, target, fair game -- (a person who is the aim
of an attack (especially a victim of ridicule or exploitation) by some
hostile person or influence; "he fell prey to muggers"; "everyone was
fair game"; "the target of a manhunt")
        => punching bag -- (a person on whom another person vents their
anger; "he resigned because his boss used him as a punching bag")
        => scapegoat, whipping boy -- (someone punished for the errors
of others)

Sense 2
martyr -- (one who voluntarily suffers death as the penalty for refusing
to renounce their religion)
     -> victim -- (an unfortunate person who suffers from some adverse
circumstance)
        => casualty, injured party -- (someone injured or killed in an
accident)
        => casualty -- (someone injured or killed or captured or missing
in a military engagement)
        => hunted person -- (a person who is hunted)
        => martyr, sufferer -- (one who suffers for the sake of principle)
        => martyr -- (one who voluntarily suffers death as the penalty
for refusing to renounce their religion)
        => muggee -- (a victim of a mugging; "the law seems to give more
protection to the mugger than to the muggee")
        => murderee -- (a victim who is murdered)
        => poor devil, wretch -- (someone you feel sorry for)
        => prey, quarry, target, fair game -- (a person who is the aim
of an attack (especially a victim of ridicule or exploitation) by some
hostile person or influence; "he fell prey to muggers"; "everyone was
fair game"; "the target of a manhunt")
        => punching bag -- (a person on whom another person vents their
anger; "he resigned because his boss used him as a punching bag")
        => scapegoat, whipping boy -- (someone punished for the errors
of others)

(for comments - in lieu of nature poetry/poetics or a replacement)



Ground zero (second, close to final, version)


Zero is ground down; the ground has no depth; the ground is flattened;
ground is always already charnel-hus; ground is always killing-field;
ground is replete, fecund, historic; history is flattened; ground is
characterized by the _trail_; the trail crosses the ground; the ground is
obdurate, inert, among and within the trail. The ground trails the trail;
the trail trails the ground.

Ground is space, now this is space, now this is time, this was time;
ground is, this is time now, this is space there.

Ground zero is the ground of the wild, the trail of the wild, its call or
calling, kill or culling. Ground zero is the table-tabulation of the
ground, part-objects of plants, animals, organic debris; ground is always
already debris. The ground does not suffer: the suffering of the ground is
our suffering: the ground is contaminated with our suffering.

Our suffering is the suffering of the ground - which is not the suffering
of the ground - which does not suffer - our suffering is the table-
tabulation, the unknown, unaccounted, unaccountable, unaccounted-for basis
of data, the blurring of data: all this construct of the human upon
absolutely nothing.

It is here that the wild parts the Wild, that the Wild decomposes - not on
the technological, on the subsequent extinctions, on the devolving of
extinctions - but on ground zero, on table-tabulations - from the begin-
ning an established fact.

From here the strategy is the move to the tabled, the move which is a
history of the process of tabling: the recognition, not of the Wild, but
of its loss inherent within the Wild. Which isn't to say a foregone
conclusion, but a technology gone wild, infected, infecting.

Now what remains: ground zero already charnel-hus, slaughtered animals,
what shall one do now? The question parallels standard 'what is to be
done?' - to which there is no answer. Ground zero - not the Ground Zero of
9/11 - but the ground zero of the trail, the trace - must be absolutely
understood and understood absolutely: that the Wild has always been
sundered to the extent that human languaging and culture have operated
through the _trajectory of the hand-ax_ - from stone through reification
to ax, from ax through exchange to ax. The trajectory refers to the
_skittering_ of the trail across ground zero. The skittering is scythe and
dominion, the distinction that makes a distinction: live and dead, hunter
and prey, herd and cull, grain and territory.

Once there is travel, tool, reification, ground zero is both relinquish-
ment and harboring. The violence of writing is here within table-
tabulation, the sintering of ground zero, the remeasurement of trail, the
contestation of trail and table.

Why is any of this a matter of concern? Because the Wild continues to be
romanticized, farmed-out, mystified; the sublime itself is the Wild placed
beyond reach, the distance of a troubling absolute. I believe one must
begin otherwise - with Holocaust, with disappearance. This needs more than
text or voice, more than lip service. It's useless to pretend that the
issue is "management" or "wildlife corridor" or "dark matter" or "natural
selection" or even "selection" given the fold-catastrophic (re: Thom)
nature of extinction. The horror inheres to flattening, to trail. It is
not an addition, not techne, not technology. As population increases, it
is simply coming into greater view. The issue is a fundamental geopolit-
ical one. The only solutions may well be enclaves, data-bases, DNA banks,
regions within hunting or poaching are punishable by death. This is far
too little too late. It is the best chance there is. It does not address
the future collapse of culture world-wide as pollution and climate rampage
- these will happen. It does address the the end of things (end of the
Wild, end of megafauna, end of variety, end of coastal culture), and that
is all we can hope for.

ii

It is not a question of apocalypse; it has always been a question of
apocalypse; humans have read the trails, walked and traced them, from the
beginning, from the beginning of organism. Every organism has culture. The
question becomes "how are we with apocalypse"; "how are we among the
apocalyptic." For this condition, this state-of-affairs, this desire,
looms closer, as if the apocalyptic announced itself.

I read far too often that humans have cried apocalyptic far too often - but
for a moment, put yourself in the position of a polar bear, or black
rhino, or bonobo: Consider these, as well, crying apocalyptic, until the
last of the them disappears.

It is not, again, "what is to be done," but "what is the doing." And it is
insufficient to abjure the doing, as in the notion there can be no lyric
poetry, perhaps no poetry, after the Holocaust, that other holocaust that
continues in yet other forms. This bypasses, not only doing, but thinking
that may yet reveal another dawn in the midst of dusk. One might say in
return, all dawns are ruptured. The day is ruptured by the night. What
remains, what is never ruptured: ground zero - one might say the substance
of ground zero, but here there is no divisibility; one fails and falters
with the other.

iii

Ground zero is the ground of debris, spew, emission - the ground that
erases traces, derails trails. It is never so simple as inscription, but a
confluence of inscriptions, spatio-temporal strata, cross-purposeless. The
fossil record is the miniscule surface of the world appearing as depth.
But there is enough present to indicate that today something is wrong,
incoherent - an environment that changes faster than adaptation, fit only
for generalists - species, themselves, that might be in trouble later on.

The artificial (zoo, museum, housing development) requires energy and
continuous maintenance. It is a strange attractor of finance; without
money, the budget of organism falls apart. It is susceptible to world
politics, to a world with rapidly decreasing resources. The Wild must be
seen against this background. The Wild and its species have disappeared -
which means the cultures of these species have disappeared - which means,
further, that we are dealing with organisms divested of spatial and
temporal history. There are no neighborhoods, no learned behaviors, that
are not contaminated by humans - both within the artificial, and in the
remnant parks and "wildernesses" on a planet experience an information
implosion, population explosion.

Think of the artificial as organism banking, and continuous maintenance as
the lineage of organisms translated to the lineage of human beings, in the
future perhaps other technologies. The point is this: these lineages are
disrupted as well, are broken - and a single break results in permanent
loss. Kill the zoo, kill the species. Develop a plot of land harboring an
irreplaceable biome, and the biome is gone forever. It's a no-win situation
- environmentalists hold out with man/woman-years, and the biome seems
safe - but one victory of development, and everything is lost. This is an
example of the "fragility of good things" in catastrophe theory - if
everything goes right, good things happen - but there are many more -
astronomically many more - things that can "go wrong" - and any of them
permanently eliminate the catastrophic peak of "goodness." In this sense
"goodness" might be defined as _any_ desired state-of-affairs; there's no
ethos implied.

A "world of generalists" will never be the end of the story, as generalist
species compete with one another, construct new strategies, fill new
ecological niches. Competition continues on a planet of rapidly depleting
resources. There _is_ an end in sight, as variety ultimately decreases
exponentially.

Culture suffers as well. Projects disappear as coastlines are inundated,
fresh water and fossil fuels are at a premium, and replacement fuels
create vast changes in biomes themselves. Gasoline replacement comes at a
price - again, of ecological niches, cultures, even an acceptable air
quality level. Couple this with population pressure (we're not yet at the
9-10 billion peak expected), and one has a world in which criminal
activity is necessary for survival. Poaching will be long gone - there
will be nothing left to poach (I think of the denuded hills around Ciudad
Juarez already as an example). What we still consider, ever more tenu-
ously, the "safe" internet, will exist locally at best, most probably used
for gang/terror networking. The simplicity and spread of nuclear arms only
adds to the mess.

Here is the ground zero of debris, detritus, effluvia: when there is no
return to and from the Wild, when the "natural" becomes a literally mean-
ingless term, when histories are absorbed and annihilated.

It is at this point that one must start, politically, ecologically, phen-
omenologically, if there is any hope - not of transformation - but of
functional enclaving. The world has become a mobius-strip Auschwitz,
encompassing everything - where we are inmates and guards, where there is
no outside. The image itself - the reality of this metaphor - is still
only on the horizon, but the reality of its referent is upon us.

Oren,

I don't know what you're looking for but my favorite book store in London is call Bookmarks. It's a socialist/marxist bookstore. Really great books I can't find anywhere else.  It's on 1 Bloomsbury Street in the West End. There's usually a sandwich board on the sidewalk to help you see it. Also, It's on the corner and painted, of course, red. About three or so blocks from the British Museum. The tube station is Tottenham Court Rd.(which is about four blocks or so to Bookmarks.) It's in the WC1 postal area. Phone is 020 76371848. You must check it out! Have fun, Cynie

Mark,

I do not want to blow my own horn but The Peripheral Space of Photography is
a serial ekphrastic poem, in your sense, where one hypothetically obtain
photographs for its different parts.

mark--
What Murat writes is uure--I would highly recommend you --and everyone
really on this list--read this exceptional text--
unlike Barthes' and Sontag's  books on photography, Murat's uses an actual
photgraphy exhibition, moving from room to room --the spaces of the
exhibtion, spaces within the photos--and meditating on various aspects of
each photo as well as reviewing and rethinking photos in groupings from
differing parts of the exhibition.  The work builds room by room step by
step and look by look a thinikng through of gesture as/in photogrpahy in
relation with democracy, thinks through many different ways of seeing, of
framing (room, doorway,image, remembered and re-membered image) and while it
seems to be arcing towads a philosophical investigation, reaches a point at
which the larva suddenly emegres as a butterfly,a poem.  (at end of book is
the information for the catalogue, and the page numbers in it of the photos
written about--so you have for purposes of anthology all the references you
need for both text and image to be placed together--)
  I am putting it in very simple ways,trying to leave room for the
excitement of discoveries and the ways in which Murat uses language to
subtly shift modalities of vision,sound,thought and revelation
It has the quality very much of a recit.
The descriptions and thoughts on the photogrpahs each one are wonderfully
alive and convey the real delight and freedoms one may find n an image.
There is also a very different consideration of photographic space-- as the
title says--in terms of peripheries.
This is a very exceptional book, please do read it, very alive in all senses
of the word, a real "adventure of discovery" as an experience in reading,
seeing and thinking with a poet's bringing of the fullness of each word to
its compostion.
I'm not doing it justice by trying a description--read it and find out for
yourself!

I'm sorry, no "msegol" appears at any domain name on my list; there
is no one from "skidmore.edu", either. Perhaps you have another email
address that forwards to that one; if you tell me what it is, I'll
remove it.

artists and poets to come to Studio Soto to be=20
filmed for inclusion in future versions of art=20
is/poetry is =96 in which artists say what art is =96=20
as it continues to expand beyond the nearly 500=20
artists already filmed in seven countries and seventeen languages.

At 4pm George Quasha will give a presentation=20
about his wide-ranging work =96 which explores=20
principles in common across disparate mediums =96=20
including his new book, Axial Stones: An Art of=20

Works to be shown




art is: Speaking Portraits (in the performative indicative)

art is =85 what? George Quasha=92s ongoing video work=20
of =93speaking portraits=94 puts this impossible, but=20
inevitable, question before artists themselves,=20
who let us in on their private space of art=20
definition. Some 500 artists (all kinds of=20
artists, including sculptors, painters,=20
filmmakers, video artists, poets, composers,=20
performance artists, and so on) have been filmed=20
in seven countries and seventeen languages in the=20
first four years. The result is an ongoing and=20
constantly changing work called art is.

More specifically, art is develops an open-ended=20
video art work in portraiture that registers=20
artists in the act of saying what art is. It is=20
presented as a continuous series of speaking=20
faces viewed up close, one at a time, with no=20
overlaps or special effects, filmed =93on site=94=20
under many circumstances. One unadorned face at a=20
time fills the image area, and the image frame is=20
contained within the face, thus reversing=20
conventional portraiture. The framing effectively=20
removes most social indicators (hair style,=20
clothing, context, etc.). While many famous=20
artists are included, they are mixed with lesser=20
known ones. Identification of the artist is=20
indicated only at the end of each =93speaking=20
portrait=94 in order to keep the viewer=92s attention=20
focused on the act of saying what art is rather=20
than on the identity of the speaker.





axial video

George Quasha=92s axial video comprises a range of=20
works, including =93verbal objects,=94 =93axial=20
objects,=94 and =93axial landscapes.=94 Among the works=20
to be shown are: Pulp Friction, Confingering=20
Figures, Training Light, and I Don=92t Understand=20
Language. They aim to transport the viewer =96=20
sometimes abruptly, sometimes incrementally=20
through a series of barely perceptible thresholds=20
=96 from the realm of ordinary time, perception and=20
expectations, to that of the axial, where=20
figuration gives way to the configurative, and=20
openness is the operant principle.

If the act of seeing something turns the thing=20
seen into an object, looking long and hard at it=20
can transform it beyond recognition. Becoming=20
openly configurative, it generates its own=20
further nature. As William Blake said, =93The eye=20
altering alters all.=94 =93Objects=94 are perceptual,=20
cognitive, and linguistic configurations. Neither=20
fixed nor stable, perceived reality may be free=20
to turn on an invisible axis. That objects =96=20

I note that when you play

salad) in Winamp, it immediately displays the artist name and the track
name. However, if you click the above URL and let it stream into your
browser for a couple of seconds, click the browser's 'stop' button, and then
search the text for the artist name or track name, it isn't in the file (or
is encrypted). Any idea on how to get a handle on the artist name and track
name?

ja?

We are pleased to announce a new book of poetry by Rae Armantrout, "Next Life."

In her latest collection, Rae Armantrout considers the shaping
effects of language in the context of new and frightening global
realities. Attempting to imagine the unimaginable and see the unseen,
Armantrout evokes a "next life" beyond the current, and too often
degraded, one. From the new physics to mortality, Armantrout engages
with the half-seen and the half-believed. These poems step into the
dance of consciousness and its perennial ghost partner-"to make the
world up/of provisional pairs." At a time when our world is being
progressively despoiled, Armantrout has emerged as one of our most
important and articulate authors. These poems push against the limit
of knowledge, that event-horizon, and into the echoes and phantasms
beyond, calling us to look toward the "next life" and find it where
we can.

Folks,

if you want evidence for how war resistance and peace poetry are being belitted, skewed, and effaced, check out the following review of an event called "Poems of Peace and War," and then listen to the actual event.  Notice what's missing.

you're outraged/amngry/annoyes that while they all read/talked about the

OlsonNow Presents OlsonNow 3: Charles Olson @ Buffalo
April 14, 2007, 1 p.m.
Hallwalls Cinema at the Church
341 Delaware Avenue, Buffalo, NY
$6, $4 members of Hallwalls or Just Buffalo/Students with I.D.

Charles Olson taught at the University at Buffalo from 1963-1965.  =20
His presence at the University continues to reverberate in Buffalo.  =20
His many contemporaries brought in for readings or for teaching gigs =20
(Robert Duncan, Denise Levertov, Ed Dorn, John Wieners, Gregory =20
Corso, Amiri Baraka, et al) helped create a unique atmosphere in =20
which innovative poetry could flourish. Many of his students and =20
colleagues from Buffalo went on to make important contributions to =20
poetry and scholarship, including: Charles Boer, Harvey Brown, George =20=

Butterick, Jack Clarke, Albert Glover, Duncan McNaughton, Stephen =20
Rodefer, Fred Wah and others. Perhaps even more important, his =20
replacement, Robert Creeley, who arrived in 1966, kept that spirit =20
alive for 40 years.  His influence lead directly to the founding of =20
Just Buffalo in 1975 as a venue to present poetry in the community =20
rather than in the academy, and to the creation of the Poetics =20
Program at the University in 1989.

The third installment of OlsonNow: Charles Olson @ Buffalo will take =20
place on April 14 at Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center Cinema in =20
Buffalo, New York.  At this event, we hope to highlight Olson=92s brief =20=

include Anne Waldman, Ammiel Alcalay, Robert Bertholf, Benjamin =20
Friedlander, David Landrey, Jonathan Skinner, and others.  Michael =20
Basinski, Curator of the Poetry Collection at SUNY Buffalo will also =20
talk about the Poetry Collection=92s recent acquisition of the papers =20=

of Jack Clarke. The event will include a screening of Henry Ferrini=92s =20=

"Polis is This: Charles Olson and the Persistence of Place."  The =20
filmmaker will be on hand to introduce the film and to answer =20
questions afterward.  All are welcome to participate in the =20
discussion that will take place throughout the afternoon.  If you =20
would like to make a brief, informal presentation at the event, =20

Doerksen's account reads like a fair review of the usual conformist
polemics, bombast, narcissism, self-righteousness, and downright silly
deportment of a poetry reading about "war."

Book written in txt msg
POSTED: 1:17 p.m. EST, January 25, 2007

HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- A novel whose narrative consists entirely
of mobile phone text messages has been published in Finland.
"The Last Messages" tells the story of a fictitious information-
technology executive in Finland who resigns from his job and travels
throughout Europe and India, keeping in touch with his friends and
relatives only through text messages.

His messages, and the replies -- roughly 1,000 altogether -- are
listed in chronological order in the 332-page novel written by
Finnish author Hannu Luntiala.

The texts are rife with grammatical errors and abbreviations commonly
used in regular SMS traffic.

"I believe that, at the end of the day, a text message may reveal
much more about a person than you would initially think," said
Luntiala, who also is head of a company that keeps databases on
people living in Finland.

Sari Havukainen, spokeswoman at Finnish publishing house Tammi, said
the company is considering translating the book into other languages.

The taciturn Finns, keen on all mobile gadgets, have wholeheartedly
accepted text messages as a tool to communicate even in most private
matters.

Up Is Up, But So Is Down

Contributors Maggie Dubris, Richard Hell, Eileen Myles and Elinor Nauen
(reading work by Susie Timmons) join editor Brandon Stosuy in a celebratory
reading for the recently published Up Is Up, But So Is Down: New York's
Downtown Literary Scene 1974-1992 (NYU Press). Using the book as a launchin=
g
pad, the authors will step outside its table of contents, selecting and
reading key New York texts from their own oeuvres. A reception, co-sponsore=
d
by NYU Press, will accompany the readings.

Maggie Dubris is the author of WillieWorld (Cuz Editions, 1998), Weep Not,
My Wanton (Black Sparrow Press, 2002) and Skels (Soft Skull Press, 2004).
She is presently working on an illustrated book called The Dust Zone with
the artist Scott Gillis, parts of which can be seen at www.dustzone.com.
Richard Hell's most recent CD is the 2005 retrospective Spurts from
Warner/Rhino. His novel Godlike came out in 2005 too. He's at work on a boo=

New York in 1974. Her last books were Skies and on my way (poems) and Cool
for You (a novel). She's teaching at UCSD and just finished a new novel
about the hell of becoming a female poet, called The Inferno. Sorry, Tree,
(poems), is coming out in April from wave books. Susie Timmons was a poet i=
n
New York from 1975-1991. The city chewed her up and spit her out, and it
felt great. Brandon Stosuy, a staff writer and columnist at Pitchfork,
contributes regularly to The Believer, used to contribute regularly to The
Village Voice, writes for Paper Thin Walls, Seattle Weekly, and Spin, and
has written for Arthur, BlackBook, Bomb, Bookforum, LA Weekly, Slate and V,
among other publications. He lives in Brooklyn, where he is at work on The
Believer's 2007 Music Issue Compilation CD, a large essay on Gordon Lish,

Fall Workshop Reading

Students of Marcella Durand, Larry Fagin, Kristin Prevallet and Gary
Sullivan read from the work they wrote in the past season's workshops.



Spring Workshops at the Poetry Project


The Poetry School Of Poetry =AD  Douglas Rothschild
Tuesdays at 7 Pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 13th

Writing  poetry is difficult; writing good poetry, more difficult still. In
this  workshop, we will focus on exactly what we think is good in a poem &
determine how our senses of aesthetics inform our responses to this
question. Working within our own aesthetic notions we will then begin to
refine our  writing, & help each other to write the best poems that we can.
The workshop  will conduct a number of actual experiments with writing that
will allow us to  step outside the world of id, which wants to keep all the
beautiful words,  & into the artistic self, which understands which pieces
fit & which  belong elsewhere. We will also engage the basic Poetry School
of Poetry premise  that the poet=B9s first job is to learn how to edit. Dgls
N. Rthschld has been  behind the foods table at the New Years Reading more
times than it is worth  mentioning. He has also written a number of
chapbooks, the most ground breaking  entitled The Minor Arcane.  He has
taught what seem to be innumerable college writing classes, and is
currently teaching at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, a CUNY
school.=20


The Visible Unseen: Writing Outside Borders =AD Akilah Oliver
Thursdays at 7 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 15th

Are  poetry and prose virtual realities, simulations of something other, or
the real  thing? Where does the =B3I=B2  live? How many moments exist in  the
moment of the line? What  borders of form are crucial for us to hang on to =
&
which boundaries are  collapsible? In this workshop, we  will explore the
connections and tensions between the visible and the unseen  world/s, not a=
s
dualities or binaries, but as complementary sites of  composition. Through
engagement with text (written and visual), public spaces, the imagination,
dreams and Eros, participants are invited to think of writing as that which
re-imagines the known and the unknown. Though this is a text based workshop=
,
poets, prose writers, and artists from all disciplines are welcome. Reading=
s
include: Giorgio Agamben, Laura Mullen, Whitman, Anne Waldman, Derrida, &
Ben Okri. Akilah Oliver is the  author of the she said dialogues: flesh
memory, An Arriving Guard of Angels, Thusly  Coming to Greet, a(A)gust, &
The Putterer=B9s Notebook. She is faculty at the Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics Summer  Writing Program at Naropa University.


Impurity  Rocks! A Poetry Lab & Workshop =AD Joanna Fuhrman
Fridays at 7 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 16th

The class will focus on  =B3impure=B2 poetry, poetry that employs a mixture of
tones and styles. Special  emphasis will be placed on works that combine
narrative and humor with  linguistic and imagistic disjunction. In-class
exercises and take-home assignments  will touch on issues of scale, space,
sound, genre and wordplay. Time will also  be devoted to reading published
poems as well as in-depth discussions and  critiques of student work. Joann=
a
Fuhrman is the author of three collections of  poetry, Freud in Brooklyn,
Ugh Ugh Ocean and Moraine, all published by Hanging Loose Press. She has
taught poetry  writing at The University of Washington, The Cooper Union
Saturday Outreach  program and in the New York City Public Schools.


Poetry  For The Page, Stage, And Computer Screen =AD Thomas Savage
Saturdays At 12 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 17th

This  course is a writing workshop where students' writing is the main
focus.  Also used as inspiration and writing prompts will be samples of wor=
k
by  writers from The Beats, Black Mountain poets, The New York School (all
generations), Language Poetry, Poets Theater, Pablo Neruda, and works being
published today online, among other sources. Practices will include  readin=
g
as well as writing assignments and, in a great Poetry Project tradition,
in-class writing. Thomas Savage has written eight published books of  poems
including most recently Bamiyan Poems, Brain Surgery Poems and Political
Conditions/Physical  States. His poems  have appeared in many print and
online venues including The New York Times, Hanging Loose, Rattapallax, Big
Bridge, Black Box, and regularly on the Wryting-L website. He has taught
poetry  workshops at The Poetry Project and Tribes Gallery.

Subject:      Dorn's scapegoat landscape
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

(I was thinking of posting about this yesterday, and
again this morning, but I was curious to see if anyone
else would note and remark on the following
serendipity--synchronicity--co-incidence):

In light of the recent exchanges here re/ poems about
scapegoats, it is quite interesting that the brand new
issue of Big Bridge, announced yesterday, and, I
presume, posted that same day, contains the following
extraordinary poem by the late Edward Dorn, part of
the "Featured Chapbook" by Dorn--"Low Coups and Haut
Coups". (I hope my joy in attempting an explication of
this short piece doesn't bring anyone too much pain):



HI COO

The scapegoat's milk
is homogenized
The blackberry brambles
cover the hill
____________________


I interpret Dorn's first two lines to intimate that
people feel *refreshed* by the killing of the
scapegoat, so therefore they experience through this
death something like a cool pleasant drink of milk:
"scapegoat's milk".  The homogenization of the milk
highlights the fact that scientific-technological
rationality, "administration" if you will, has been
applied to the immemorial process of scapegoating
(well, yeah...the Nazis and all...), as to so many
other things.

But the great Mystery is the relation of the first two
lines to the last two.

The "hill" might well be the locus for the killing of
the goat.  But beyond that, we seem to have the fusion
of natural process (lines 3-4) and the most
desreditable sort of human practice.

In this fusion I find a hard-won deep serenity (mind
you, I'm not suggesting *resignation*) I don't really
associate with the work of Mr. Dorn, kind of more like
the work of Gary Snyder, perhaps.
___________________________

The whole Dorn chapbook is quite worth your while to
look at.  I'm assuming it's late work, i.e., sometime
post _Slinger_, and as such it truly shines, like the
_Chemo Sabe_ (Dorn's sequence involving his cancer &
treatment) poems I've seen; the poem where he compares
his beleagured ancestors to The Kurdish nation; and
the Dorn poem about Olson that Tom Clark includes in
the preface or afterward, whatever it was, of the
paperback version of the unfortunate Olson bio.  As
AGAINST most of the late writing in Dorn's _Hello, La
Jolla!_  & _Yellow Lola_, which I find rather acrid
and often trivial, if I were to sum it up in a phrase.

It'd be great to hear a date on the composition of the poems in the
chapbook as well as any relevant info on where the manuscript came
from if anybody is privy to that info.  (I assume all this will be
covered by the upcoming Penguin Selected, but why publish the poems
on-line without including it?)

Eric,

While I agree that at least one poet-participant descended into bombast, and certainly I agree that Dunya Mikhail is worth reading, you and Doerkner missed again the main point--this wasn't an event about war, it was Poems of Peace and War.  The entire framing of the event was to problematize our way of thinking about peace and war--not just representing war, dramatizing war, writing war (hard enough to chew over in the short time allowed); the critic essentially is acting on a kind of reflex-- 1) civilians have nothing to say about war, 2) veterans have everything to say about war, and 3) there is no point in thinking about what is the beyond of war, the relationship between peace and war.  Even more so--that merely writing about/through war is somehow to be consuming it for poetic gain.  I'm sorry, that's bullshit.  I can't speak for all the participants involved, but this writing is not meant as an end in itself, but part of a process of unwriting what's already been decid
e!
d, already been written.  It requires some attempt to go beyond the page--to assume otherwise is to believe poetry ends with the author, with the published page.

here's the image that you're thinking of, maybe?

http://home.earthlink.net/~valis2/images/ram_ur.jpg

I don't think this one is supposed to be a sacrifice, though.

the "ram/goat caught in brambles" topos reminds me of the Akeidah
(Binding of Isaac) story out of Genesis -- you know the one: Isaac was
to be sacrificed by his father Abraham on top of a mountain, but at the
last moment a ram appeared nearby with its horns caught in brambles.
that saved Isaac's bacon, so to speak.=20

could this be the ur-narrative (no pun intended, re: the Sumerian ref
above) on which the historical Jerusalem Temple practice (sending out
the scapegoat on the Day of Atonement) is based?=20

and has anyone thought of Nietzsche's analysis of "tragedy" as the "song
of the goat" (tragos + oidos =3D tragoidia) in ancient drama? that is,
another spin on sacrificing the scapegoat as purgation of a people's
sins (or Aristotelian catharsis, in literary terms).

I love Dorn's take on the depletion of the ritual's spirit, in that its
product, the scapegoat's milk, has become "homogenized" -- safe for all
consumers.

The Yale University Library and the Whitney Humanities
Center invite historians, literary scholars, artists,
and book arts enthusiasts to participate in At the
Turn of the Centuries: The Influence of Early 20th
Century Book Arts on Contemporary Artists' Books, a
conference to be held on April 13, 2007, on the campus
of Yale University.

Please consult our web site for further details:
http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/centuries/index.html


At the Turn of the Centuries: The Influence of Early
20th Century Book Arts on Contemporary Artists' Books

Speakers will include Marcia Reed, Curator of Rare
Books, Getty Research Institute; Stephen Bury, Head of
European and American Collections, British Library;
and Angela Lorenz, acclaimed American book artist and
book arts scholar. The conference will consider the
work of various innovative and avant-garde artists and
writers just after the turn of the twentieth century,
including the Dadaists and Surrealists, and its
influence on post-war artists and writers, including
those associated with OULIPO and Fluxus, and
contemporary inheritors of these traditions in art,
literature, and bookwork.

Additionally, the conference will highlight strengths
of the Yale Arts of the Book Collection and the modern
European and American collections at the Beinecke Rare
Book and Manuscript Library. At the Turn of the
Centuries will honor the late Tony Zwicker's life-long
commitment to the inventive and original in modern and
contemporary book arts.

Registration is free, but required for planning
purposes. Space for breakout working groups is very
limited, thus registration is mandatory for these
sessions. Please visit our registration page in
February 2007 to sign up.

Philip,

Thanks for your thoughtful reply.

It's not that I believe "there is no point in thinking about what is the
beyond of war, the relationship between peace and war." On the contrary,
I find many poets resist the topic, preferring to default to a
universalist, pacifist, "why can't we all just live in peace and make
art?" position. In this admittedly seductive default position, questions
of war and peace never get addressed. We get slogans and hype. From
slogans and hype, one can't really try to identify the relationship
between peace and war, because war is always bad and peace is always
good and people who advocate war are always bad and people who advocate
peace are always good. Good versus evil, and extending the banal
dualism, hip versus unhip.

You get Curtis Blow lyrics: WAR .... what's it good for...absolutely
nothing! And people don't question the slogan and hype. People don't
consider that war ended slavery in America, defeated the Nazis and ended
their extermination camps, halted genocides, and allowed the advance of
more liberal societies over more repressive ones. War bad, peace good,
and anyone who says otherwise is an evil asshole. More slogans and hype.

Further, one can credibly argue that war is the natural state of
mankind, and peace is the brief period of calm following the total
defeat of major powers. It's not like we have peace as the status quo,
and then some tyrants and political monsters come along and make war;
rather we have war and more war, until one side is so thoroughly
defeated there is a lull we call "peace." The question becomes how to
extend that interval of peace, and one cannot approach that question
with slogans and hype, by denying that war is our continuum and peace
the exception.

Finally, we tend to respect the opinions of writers who have been in
war, not merely because they can provide gruesome and vivid descriptions
from experience, but because that experience has taken them beyond
slogans and hype. Tolstoy, for example, served as an officer in the
artillery during the Crimean War, and his _War and Peace_ argues for an
acceptance of the irrational nature of the universe, of the here and
now. His pacifism was earned, and not merely a sort of party uniform or
fashion statement.

This is a great thread.

My two cents (for now):

I loathe "poetry of witness"--I don't want poets speculating about the war,
or what it must be like, or how their experiences are somehow akin to the
experiences of people living in actual warzones (see: Jorie Graham), which i
think is just beyond insulting to the ACTUAL people living through these
nightmares.

What I want (this is the activist in me) is for us to stop glossing over the
war, or academizing it, or making it aesthetically beautiful, and look at it
for what it is.  And DO something.  I hate the "you should really care about
this" genre of poems that seems to be coming from our Harvard-and-Yale
appointed poets.

I don't buy that war is necessary--in cases, justified as a last resort
(read: a defensive maneuver) to stop genocide, etc.  I don't buy that this
war has anything in common with the "great" "necessary" wars of the past.  I
don't buy that there is anything natural about killing someone.  This
doesn't make me a pacifist--I'm not willing to placate a monster to save a
life, either.  I'm advocating a return to rationality--seeing the world for
what it is.  What if, for example, instead of invading the Middle East to
control oil, which we are horribly dependent on, we realized that oil is a
fixed resource and developed a renewable energy portfolio?  As far as I
know, no wars ever started over windmills...

Why are the "great" poets of today less willing to call a thing what it
is--a bloody mess--in favor of giving a long digressionist talk?  Why is
Jorie Graham writing a book about Normandy, and making something awful into
something beautiful, when there is something really awful that needs to be
shown for what it is?

I feel like we're part of Gulliver's Travels, poets and artists who live in
an alternate reality where we pretend this isn't happening by turning it
into something else, namely, a poem.

  Philip,

Thanks for your thoughtful reply.

It's not that I believe "there is no point in thinking about what is the
beyond of war, the relationship between peace and war." On the contrary,
I find many poets resist the topic, preferring to default to a
universalist, pacifist, "why can't we all just live in peace and make
art?" position. In this admittedly seductive default position, questions
of war and peace never get addressed. We get slogans and hype. From
slogans and hype, one can't really try to identify the relationship
between peace and war, because war is always bad and peace is always
good and people who advocate war are always bad and people who advocate
peace are always good. Good versus evil, and extending the banal
dualism, hip versus unhip.

You get Curtis Blow lyrics: WAR .... what's it good for...absolutely
nothing! And people don't question the slogan and hype. People don't
consider that war ended slavery in America, defeated the Nazis and ended
their extermination camps, halted genocides, and allowed the advance of
more liberal societies over more repressive ones. War bad, peace good,
and anyone who says otherwise is an evil asshole. More slogans and hype.

Further, one can credibly argue that war is the natural state of
mankind, and peace is the brief period of calm following the total
defeat of major powers. It's not like we have peace as the status quo,
and then some tyrants and political monsters come along and make war;
rather we have war and more war, until one side is so thoroughly
defeated there is a lull we call "peace." The question becomes how to
extend that interval of peace, and one cannot approach that question
with slogans and hype, by denying that war is our continuum and peace
the exception.

Finally, we tend to respect the opinions of writers who have been in
war, not merely because they can provide gruesome and vivid descriptions
from experience, but because that experience has taken them beyond
slogans and hype. Tolstoy, for example, served as an officer in the
artillery during the Crimean War, and his _War and Peace_ argues for an
acceptance of the irrational nature of the universe, of the here and
now. His pacifism was earned, and not merely a sort of party uniform or
fashion statement.

I feel this way abt Carolyn Forche.
When Anne Sexton took her life, Denise Levertov wrote that Anne was a victim
& that Latin Am revolutionaries were heroes-- bec Denise was worried that
young poets wd take Anne as a role model. Actually, Denise was a role model
to me in many ways & this was the one thing she wrote I had a hard time w/
bec she particularized it to Anne, who had just died.
Also remember Denise getting furious at a poet who used napalm as a
metaphor.
Eliot Weinberger criticized a poets against the war reading many yrs ago--he
felt poets shd act not  just write poems abt war.

Let's give some uncomfortable facts and see if Eric really believes
what he said after they're presented:

In order,

People don't consider that war ended slavery in America,

Andrew Johnson's 1877 compromise that ended Reconstruction (which
could well have put an end to slavery on more than a juridical level --
 unless Eric is an adherent of the D.W. Griffith theory of history)
returned African Americans to a state of disenfranchisement that
required a civil rights movement in the 1960s to alleviate, and that
Katrina and its aftermath, not to mention the disproportionate
presence of African Americans in prison, showed to be far from over.

> defeated the Nazis and >ended their extermination camps

And in 1945, not long after the triumph of the Allies over the Axis
(sealed by the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki), the French
military exterminated an entire village -- Setif -- in Algeria.
Meanwhile, ex-Nazis became valued assets to the U.S. government in
building the space program and (hello, Klaus Barbie) carrying out
repression in Latin America.

> genocides, and allowed the advance of more >liberal societies over
> more repressive ones.

Definitions, please?  "More liberal societies"?  Like Guatemala?
Pinochet's Chile?  Marcos's Philippines?  RENAMO in Mozambique?  The
contras in Nicaragua?  ARENA death squads in El Salvador?

Doubtless Eric would sneer at Martin Luther King for his pacifism, but
we do well to remember his words "My country is the greatest purveyor
of violence in the world."  So it was then, and so it remains.

Angela -
Are we to feel guilty because we create art out of pain or grief or
horror?  I don't countenance some of the "academizing" of war, as you
put it, by poets in safe circumstances, but a poet must work out of
where she is, what's perceived, emotions lived with.  Somehow, I must
try to work anger and despair and love of humanity into words trying
to say it "true" - how else to stay sane?
And don't forget:  many of us poets are activists in the political
zone, no less than in our art.
Best,
Charlotte

My two cents (for now):

I loathe "poetry of witness"--I don't want poets speculating about
the war,
or what it must be like, or how their experiences are somehow akin to
the
experiences of people living in actual warzones (see: Jorie Graham),
which i
think is just beyond insulting to the ACTUAL people living through these
nightmares.

What I want (this is the activist in me) is for us to stop glossing
over the
war, or academizing it, or making it aesthetically beautiful, and
look at it
for what it is.  And DO something.  I hate the "you should really
care about
this" genre of poems that seems to be coming from our Harvard-and-Yale
appointed poets.

I don't buy that war is necessary--in cases, justified as a last resort
(read: a defensive maneuver) to stop genocide, etc.  I don't buy that
this
war has anything in common with the "great" "necessary" wars of the
past.  I
don't buy that there is anything natural about killing someone.  This
doesn't make me a pacifist--I'm not willing to placate a monster to
save a
life, either.  I'm advocating a return to rationality--seeing the
world for
what it is.  What if, for example, instead of invading the Middle
East to
control oil, which we are horribly dependent on, we realized that oil
is a
fixed resource and developed a renewable energy portfolio?  As far as I
know, no wars ever started over windmills...

Why are the "great" poets of today less willing to call a thing what it
is--a bloody mess--in favor of giving a long digressionist talk?  Why is
Jorie Graham writing a book about Normandy, and making something
awful into
something beautiful, when there is something really awful that needs
to be
shown for what it is?

I feel like we're part of Gulliver's Travels, poets and artists who
live in
an alternate reality where we pretend this isn't happening by turning it
into something else, namely, a poem.

Charlotte,

No, we are not to feel guilty.  But there has to be something BEYOND that,
right?  I don't really believe in writing political poems--I wrote an entire
chapbook of poems about the pain and horror and loss and distance I
experienced when my sister was sent to Iraq.  But I spent my time working to
get BushCo out of power, etc.  This is what I mean--if Jorie Graham (I pick
on her because she was so great 10 years ago) stopped making things like
Normandy into pretty lyrical avante-garde/academic poems, and started using
her position, etc to DO SOMETHING or MAKE SOMEONE AWARE...that would be
infinitely better than telling us that saving a bird makes her like a person
in Iraq.  It's insulting.

I guess my point is this: it's not enough to talk about it or write about
it--the great poets of the 60's/Vietnam Era DID something about it.  Why
aren't our "great poets" doing anything?

Angela

ps--I agree that we write from our experience.  And we write best that way.

In case you missed it,Holland Cotter has a sweet and enthusiastic review of
the NYC version of the traveling Semina museum show in today's NY Times.

Semina magazine and the culture about it was a mid-century seed-bed of work
of mainly Los Angeles and San Francisco based artists and poets.  It is
accompanied by a very good catalog, including a smart essay among several,
by Steve Fredman - whose critical work on poets is probably familiar to many
on this list.

Enjoy,

This is a great thread, and I'm much less interested in defending my own
provisional notions than in reading what others think.

I'll respond to Christopher anyway, who objects to my contention that
some wars have good outcomes.

To my statement that "People don't consider that war ended slavery in
America," Christopher responds by lumping the long history of slow civil
rights progress.

The Slavers wouldn't have stopped without war and that is certain. The
progress started with conflict, hit a milestone with the Civil War
conflict, continued through the conflict of the late '50s/early '60s
Civil Rights actions, and continues through conflict today. That it's
far from over does not invalidate my point that war, in truth, made the
progress possible.


To my statement that war "defeated the Nazis and ended their
extermination camps," Chris again lumps all manner of subsequent
brutality and peripetia, as if to invalidate the point that Auschwitz
was closed because the Nazis were defeated in war.


Finally, to my point that war "allowed the advance of more liberal
societies over more repressive ones," Chris asks:

 >>Definitions, please?  "More liberal societies"?


Yes, I was initially thinking of the ancient Greeks defeating the
Persians in the 5th century BC, and thus continuing a society that
advanced reason, science, democracy, medicine, and individuality over a
society that emphasized Emperor Worship.

However, go back to the Allies defeating the Axis sixty-two years ago.
Flawed as the US or any modern government is, ours is a better polis
than the Nazis or Japanese Emperor would have allowed.  War made that
possible.

Sneer at it? No, I hope he embraces it -- no nation or people can be
a "great power" who are not the greatest purveyor of violence in the
world at any given time in history.  Of course, you may argue, if you
will, that you don't want to be part of a nation or people with
aspirations to be, or that is, a great power. But if that's the case,
my next question is: Are you a US citizen?

But on a list full of postmodernists, on what grounds can you
possibly argue that war or violence is wrong or bad? Isn't the
essence of the postmodern world view that every opinion is just as
good as every other opinion? How, starting from there, do you say
that anything is wrong or bad?

A great essay on poetry, war, pacifism, and also example in her life of
chnage from pacifism to doing work in england contributing to war
effort--and one might also say a form of martyr as lived on diet that french
occupied people were and starved to death basically--Simone Weil's essay
"The Iliad:  A Poem of Force"

In the issue of Big Bridge which just went on line are some excellent
insights, thoughts and much backround history also in essays by John
Bradley, Philip Metres and Murat Nemet-Nejat and also d-b chirot; also an
essay/review of Kent Johnson's "Lyric Poetry After Auschwitz" by J Beer

http://www.bigbridge.org

at my blogspot is an ongoing international Mail Art/Visual Poetry Call "For
Lebanon, For Palestine  Human Rights-Peace-Liberty" and posters for Peace
marches, art work by many artists and my own work and also photos from
Lebanon and Palestine--also various forms of visual/sound poetry from other
eras and found art and art brut etc-essay by Amiri Baraka---essays in
archives--
http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com
and many links and more are being added--

am involved with various Peace action and Solidarity groups, local grass
roots civil rights groups (LGBT, Literacy etc)--though have been involved
long in past with groups that did 'propaganda of the deed"--etc--so
something very complex and not easily answered without lot of time, study
and action--thoght and reflectionand maybe an impossible question, that is,
depending on person unsolvable in an aboslute sense--
"out of the struggle with oneself ismade poetry" writes yeats but that
struggle can be to afce peace & violence existing inside oneself and how to
create something out of the goings on among the questionings-
Milwaukee also is lot of involvement with Venezuela as we have a sister city
there and also Chiapas via Sts Peter and Paul Parish  (also does a lot of
immigration issues work)

earlier today i sent a post with lots of info, sites, links etc for March
tomorrow , petitions, etc and how to be virtual part of the march if can't
attend in person--

there are a lot of reasons for maybe poets not seeming more involved--poet
and artist friends from other countries write ad askabout this--debates abt
form, general atmosphere of silencing of protests, reports on them and
speaking out in general in the media and among peers since 9/11 and now
controversy with President Carter's book, very conservative society over all
starting with reagan--protest was "unhip" and etc--breaking of the unions
leading to aggresive attacks on idea of people working together for a common
good or cause, pitting of one group against another to ignore shared
problems and the now three Wars without End--Poverty, Drugs, Terrorism--all
aimed at criminalization of various parts of society--twenty -five years of
breaking down idea of resistance in public sphere--maybe now the tide will
start to turn a bit--
there aren't just the wars aboard america is inovled in , allied with--there
is a war in americaa on americans and residents also--though largely ignored
and distorted and continually worsened--Katrina for alittle bit exposed some
ofit for all tosee--but he world people glimsped briefly is one a huge
number of americans live--let alone is country with the most people in
prison in the world--the drug problem is escalating at huge rate--not among
young but among males over forty--persoanlly i know six people dead in
lessthan amonth from the new heroinfrom afghanistan, many many more in
hospitals and jails--health care system is basically becoming a form of
eugenics--in many ways--smashing aprt of communities by poverty, drugs,
crime constant cutting and neglect--infrastructures taht are rotting and
worthless in man areas--latest news on LA being more violent than whole
states, or group of small states--lotof due to the massive influx of drugs
being introduced into communities deliberately--
and so on and on and on--
so is plenty of material al around one for activism of all sorts, voluneteer
work --and use  in poetry and art work--various poets and groups and styles
etc don't but doesn't mean others can't find their own way in it, create new
ways of it--
speaking out is discouraged a good deal from many sides yet supposedly one
still has the right to--so go ahead and do it anyway--find others ways not
yet thought of or tried--
also anti-war poetry and art despite the stereotype of it, isn't
non-innovative in form--historically one of the most explosive and
innovative with huge influence in the present--Dada--was
anti-war--anti-imperialism, anti-elitism, andnotice that dada is an
internatioanl movement which in each city and country it was active, had a
local charcter of its own--
Shinkichi Takahashi the great Zen master,essayist and poet--was Japan's
first dadaist and dada poet--for awhile the only one--then joined by
others--dada very aggressive butanti-war--like American hard Core music
anti-racism,anti-reagan--etc etc-

many welcomings of suggestions from somewhere inside of a big headache wher=
e
i seem to be working on these questions again too. (although perhaps the
best thing to say is that, in fact, i keep stopping to read more and more
writing by skip fox. perhaps, yes, it's true, *that* is the only
revolutionary act.)

**

AXIOM 1:Those who say that they aren't writing politically fail to
understand what politics is.



***



SUBJECTIVE CORRELATIVE 1: Many who think that they are writing politically
are merely mouthing slogans and reproducing facts that have been handed dow=
n
to them by the political systems that they pretend to oppose. Language poet=
s
dissolved themselves as authors specifically for the purpose of addressing
this problem. (I think that it is Lyn Hejinian and Rosmarie Waldrop that I
am speaking of here=97perhaps Steve McCaffery too?). It was a noble project=
.
It was a good start. But it seems that it is time for someone to stake out
claims in these and all texts, to speak from them and speak for them so the=
y
live.



A friend of mine, Christian Peet, responded to GB's Orange Alert by posting
a picture of a very old advertisement for California oranges. The woman in
the picture looked a little bit like the scales of justice. She had oranges
in both of her hands. I tried join into this song by leaving oranges out in
the streets. We just wanted to call back the word orange into a body that
could end world hunger, the kind of body that would speak with a tongue tha=
t
could taste (and, when it bites itself, bleed).



Calling back He, She might be a good start towards calling back the word
'I'. It is a problem that I do not see any object that I and I can place in
the street to call back the word, we. Will all of those marching bodies
bring this word back?



Something interesting is going on there in that Russian poetry.

http://www.octopusmagazine.com/issue07/html/main.html

I think what Matvei writes about is the difficulty of saying 'I' and not
meaning just any 'I' at which the word tries to point. When you use a name
too, right along with the 'I' you are getting closer to bringing this word
back to your body=97in the sense that 'I' is a hole through which you can b=
e
fucked by language until you are pregnant with all of your speaking of it.
Speaking it aloud (even if said silently with your body 'I' mean). You are
giving it your body to use...I'm talking about the way women have for a lon=
g
time (and men, oh yes, you have done it too, quite happily, I believe).



I'm sorry you have to take that underneath position, maybe the overman
can understand from more interesting positions. But it's understanding that
is required that someone be the ground where it gets sowed. That means
coming together in such a way that it gets projected from us (see Marcel
Duchamp). It is important that we get it out of us, that we give birth.



****



We are all hosting a medium sized university.



We are all hosting several big screen TVs.



Are our bellies big enough for a polis? Are we hungry enough for it yet?



I am speaking of that politics, which could give birth to polite or police.



***

Remember when we thought of speech as an act? But somehow sometimes the
text was so exciting that somehow someone sometimes forgot that an act was =
a
body, a will and a force. Erased that old author, fine, but hows about
getting together them new bodies, mmmm? : the kind that can speak out
and call forth? A whole new creature (ask the French creer if you can see
what this means). This creature, parents will tell you, is not just a belie=
f
but a body comes out of you--a stranger with a life of its own.  That is
what I mean when I speak act.

I don't read this listserve often enough to have any sense of who you are or what your views are, so you'll have to inform me whether you consider this homophobic, bigoted bullshit to be parody. Otherwise, it's extremely offensive, and I don't appreciate, to say the least, being subjected to this kind of bigoted hate speech. Parody? I hope. Otherwise, where are the moderators and why haven't they asked you to leave? Otherwise, I'm asking them to ask you to leave.

The Futurist Manifesto, 1909

   1. We want to sing the love of danger, the habit of energy and
   rashness.
   2. The essential elements of our poetry will be courage, audacity and
   revolt.
   3. Literature has up to now magnified pensive immobility, ecstasy and
   slumber. We want to exalt movements of aggression, feverish sleeplessness,
   the double march, the perilous leap, the slap and the blow with the fist.
   4. We declare that the splendor of the world has been enriched by a
   new beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing automobile with its bonnet adorned
   with great tubes like serpents with explosive breath ... a roaring motor car
   which seems to run on machine-gun fire, is more beautiful than the Victory
   of Samothrace.
   5. We want to sing the man at the wheel, the ideal axis of which
   crosses the earth, itself hurled along its orbit.
   6. The poet must spend himself with warmth, glamour and prodigality to
   increase the enthusiastic fervor of the primordial elements.
   7. Beauty exists only in struggle. There is no masterpiece that has
   not an aggressive character. Poetry must be a violent assault on the forces
   of the unknown, to force them to bow before man.
   8. We are on the extreme promontory of the centuries! What is the use
   of looking behind at the moment when we must open the mysterious shutters of
   the impossible? Time and Space died yesterday. We are already living in the
   absolute, since we have already created eternal, omnipresent speed.
   9. We want to glorify war - the only cure for the world - militarism,
   patriotism, the destructive gesture of the anarchists, the beautiful ideas
   which kill, and contempt for woman.
   10. We want to demolish museums and libraries, fight morality,
   feminism and all opportunist and utilitarian cowardice.
   11. We will sing of the great crowds agitated by work, pleasure and
   revolt; the multi-colored and polyphonic surf of revolutions in modern
   capitals: the nocturnal vibration of the arsenals and the workshops beneath
   their violent electric moons: the gluttonous railway stations devouring
   smoking serpents; factories suspended from the clouds by the thread of their
   smoke; bridges with the leap of gymnasts flung across the diabolic cutlery
   of sunny rivers: adventurous steamers sniffing the horizon; great-breasted
   locomotives, puffing on the rails like enormous steel horses with long tubes
   for bridle, and the gliding flight of aeroplanes whose propeller sounds like
   the flapping of a flag and the applause of enthusiastic crowds.

Weren't the Futurists mostly comprised of Facists?

Only in the most adolescent mind is bigotry "revolutionary".

I asked a simple, and important question, and your evasion would seem to answer it in spades, although I hate to make such assumptions. If you gave a shit about others' feelings, you would unambiguously clarify the status of your previous, outrageous, bigoted, unacceptable statement. Maybe your just an asshole.

Italian politics is never that simple:

Mussolini was initially influenced by Marxism and the philosophies of
Nietzsche. It could be argued that his first influential position of his
political career was as editor of Avanti, the pre WW1 Italian socialist
newspaper.

Marinetti, the founder of the Futurist movement was aligned to the early
politics of Mussolini by his similar interests in Nietzsche and Sorel.

Most of the early futurists (eg Russolo) were anarchists in fact.

Although Marinetti aligned himself with Mussolini's early fascist thinking,
but the Futurists left the Fascists by 1920, only rejoining them for the
"March on Rome" when Mussolini seized power. However, at that time there
were groups of Anarchist Futurists and Communist Futurists and Ardito
Futurists.

Also, during Fascism, the Futurist movement in Italy became apolitical
(largely because it was irrelevant).

Had it not been for Marinetti's personal relationship with Mussolini, it
could be argued that Futurism had very little to do with Fascism.

However, Marinetti was homophobic and and a lot of other things. As a result
his 1919 novel Marfarka is tough yet interesting reading.

If a contributor to this list is homophobic does it really matter? If they
have the courage to be completely wrong, and wish to express this through
their art, surely that is their right. If we suppress the homophobes,
racists and people who are intolerant, we are unable to argue with them. If
we do not allow them to record their ridiculous views, then future
generations will be unable to examine their work and wonder how it was
possible that we created a society where some people felt such peculiar
views were not completely wrong.

Where I live, in Rome, the whole city is a monument to people who held
erroneous and odd views. I like the fact that the Stadio Olimpio was never
pulled down, and there are so many monuments to Fascism. The white
travertine monoliths contrast with the azure sky, reminding me how
ridiculous extremists are. A city of white monuments, some ruined, built on
a river of blood, testament to millenia of folly.

If we ban the homophobic Mr Primeau, we may as well pull down EUR, the Foro
Italico, and the Baths of Caracalla and Diocletian.

If Mr Primeau has an homophobic verse (preferably an anti ginsberg verse),
it would be marvellous if he were to post it, so we could subject it to
aesthetic criticism. I doubt though, with his antagonistic cut and pasting
of out of date manifesto's it would weigh up against the marvellous folly of
true extremist art.

By the way, the Russian futurists referred to themselves as constructivists
after a split with the Italians.

I liked your poem Exorcism Larissa by the way.

Thank you Harry Ross very much for your excellent letters re the Italian
futurists--dispelling the stereotypes of their polticis and history
(several leading futurists died in service during WW1)
Italian Futurism is still too little known for its acheivements, ideas, and
yes seeing into future--in Russolo's works and als verymuch in their Theater
and perfroamnce--
in one of his noteboks Gramsci writes how the Futurists alone had been able
to really make conatct with the working classes in their public events and
etc --also their teheater/performance--whioch were attended by very large
groups of people-often at first antagonistic--then won over in manyays--
there is a very interesting book called the futurists the formalists and the
marxists, abt the russian scene--in whcih is a review by a marxist critic of
marinetti's hugely anticiapted performances in russia--
the writer critiques the snashing of syntax, "parolein liberta" etc--noting
tht rdical rearrangements of sytax and structures being transgressed,
garramr de-ordered--is not thesame despite claims as the actual re
orderingofproeprty and labor--
an interesting comment very much ahaed of its time considered the arguments
put fwd much later in american poetry for the disuprting of normative
language being akndof equivalence with destrusction of hegemonic powers of
goeverance and thelike--
in the new issue of big bridge in essay have there, i write abt the
Futurists a bit, also in another essay that is linked there--
the question of speed is one that fascinates me--smithson and virilio's work
esp with this--
because of the idea that "speed kills" and assocations with fascism and uses
by military speed the chemicl and also the technological a very intersting
issue when one explores the ways it is used in kerouac and olson and and
smithson for example--
and virilio's long examination of it--
its relationshsips with time--
thank you very much for these two great letters!
the thing abt destorying museums is that of course so many artits who have
proclaimed this not toolong after find themselves also in the same museums!
in miwauke it s great becuase there is a sign that simply says to people
zooming on drive along lake
WAR MEMORIAL
ART MUSEUM
best blunt ststaement have ever seen of this interelationship!
thugh ne can say that the memroail of war is for the dead--
while musuem contains works these days by the living--
this is an especialy interesting time period to be rereading sorel! as have
been lately--
andthe old classics of terrorism--Dostoyevksy's The Possesed, Henry James'
The princess Cassamassima and JosephConrad'
s The Secret Agent and Under Western Eyes

The notion that if you're going to do something "sensitive" like write =
poetry you'd better be manly about it has infected poets otherwise dear =
to me, including Olson, but there's not much excuse for it now, if there =
ever was. Too bad it's still entertained by some of the younger admirers =
of Bukowski, et al, not to mention the hints of it evident in some slam =
gatherings I've been to. Phil Primeau's post reads like a typically =
noisy example of the ethos.

Dear Colleagues:

I cannot believe that the below statements by P. Primeau are meant to
be taken seriously and sincerely. Nor can I believe that this kind of
queer-bating and name-calling merits a response. Nor can I fathom this
very bizarre, anti-Semitic and homophobic attack on Allen Ginsberg,
whose courage is a matter of record. However, if these statements are
serious and sincere, then I find them deeply offensive, not to mention
ludicrous and ill-informed.

For the record, I am a poet who opposes the current wars in Afghanistan
and Iraq. It seems especially important to iterate that on this day of
anti-war protests in L.A. and Washington.

Mark Salerno


P.S. Mr Primeau, have we been put on? Could you let us in on the joke
here?

i would like to take this opportunity to point out that I, Jason Finkas Quackenbush, a liberal who voted for Ralph Nader three times, once in 1996 and
twice in the year 2000, am a good person and that my political views are in entirely in keeping with those laid out for adherence by all good liberals
by the 2005 ComIntern People's Dictum on Left Wing Orthodoxy circular #372. Having made the statement publicly so that you can all be absolutely sure
that I adhere to all pro-semitic action items on Circ 372, and am only anti-semitic on ComIntern approved subjects such as opposition to Israel's
continued refusal to return to within their pre-67 borders, I think i can speak with authority that Mr. Primeau's statements are unacceptable whether
or not they are parodic. Given that they are parodic, they are never the less repulsive to me, as a liberal, as they violate ComIntern Directive
#6172, which encyclical made the point that all liberals must behave like sour-faced humorless school marms whenever their comments are a matter of
public record. shame on you Phil, for daring to make a joke.

First, thanks to Mark Salerno for being the one exception. However, I cannot believe that NO ONE else has posted with their own outrage at Phil Primeau's bigoted remarks below. Even if he wasn't serious, I would think he would be horrified to think of the effect his words would have on someone who thought they were and clarify his post. BUt no. It is even more astounding that the responses that have come have been completely inane and certainly beside the point.

Italian Futurism and its relationship to fascism is OBVIOUSLY not the point of my completely RHETORICAL question.

Jason Q and Alexander J's belittling of the issue is completely asinine and insensitive. Your "Love God's Way" site is only partly funny and partly terrifying, and mostly funny only to those who aren't affected by it at all. There are real people who get caught up in those bullshit christian conversion programs, who are in a lot of pain; those programs only make it a lot worse. As riduculous and deserving of ridicule as they are, in the context of this (non) discussion, it's a tacky move to post that. I can't believe that you're anything but straight to denounce my "righteousness"; no one who has had to del with this bullshit would be so flip about it.

I know from personal experience--from being teasd as a sissy as a child to hearing the word "gay" for the first time when I was ten, slung at me as a slur, discerning only that it meant something I shouldn't want to be called; from having homophobic remarks yelled at me by cowards driving quickly by in their cars to the equally cowardly, bigoted students who made homophobic remarks on my course evaluations--I know from personal experience that it is generally acceptable to be as openly, publically homophobic as one pleases, wherever one pleases. It's incrediably disappointing--and infuriating--to find that this listserv is no exception.

 If Phil Primeau was merely joking, then he was a complete ass to let me think otherwise. If I had made mock bigoted remarks which someone took seriously, I would go out of my way to say unambiguously that I was just joking in order to make fun of the bigots. That's the problem with parody: it takes talent and intelligence to pull it off, and when you fail, you merely reproduce the very views you were trying to parody.

Even more infuriating is the fact there have been flurries of outraged posts over any number of similar issues. If he had called women "cunts" in an obviously derivisive manner (can it be otherwise?), or used words like nigger or kike or spic instead of "queers", and had refused to state that indeed he'd intended to be parodic and meant no harm, then this list would be up in arms! But on the issue of homophobia: a virtual silence?!? This bothers no one else besides Mark??? I feel like I'm in an episode of the Twilight Zone!

I didn't respond bec I thought it was a joke tho in bad taste & so many
people were writing abt it & one can't respond to everything but do feel bad
for anyone who has been hurt by those exchanges. But the futurist manifesto
included a phrase against feminism which no one mentioned--but they were
against everything in that adolescent male way that can be revolutionary or
hurtful or fun or all 3. There weren't exactly hordes of writers defending
women in the last exchanges abt that so don't start criticizing women now!
we need to support each other.

The last acceptable bigotry in America is to be against the working class.
If you live in the Midwest or Northeast you know what I mean. At least
Homosexuals have social currency but what does the resident of Flint,
Michigan have?

My apologies for not fully exploring this thread before discussing  Futurism;
obviously something more important needs to be discussed.

As a poet, I am identified with Tom Robinson Band's (TRB) song Power in the
Darkness, part of which I sing as preface to my own poetry. This  seminal gay
band's song is my usual Myspace music; they were probably  the first rock band
to use racial-sexist-homosexual-hating epithets in the cause  of political
awareness---and the effect is horrifying, and one of the most  effective and
thrilling calls to action I know. I wonder if Mr. Primeau is  using his words
similarly--I hope-- or as Patti Smith does. This is the way I  understand his
post. I hope I am not being naive. I would appreciate knowing  what Mr. Primeau
meant--shock value of words to raise our consciousness, or  unconscious deep
hatred?

Michael,

I think you miss the point and, to be honest, I am not
all that interested in prolonging this to naseaum. If
maybe you had more experience under belt, you'd better
understand that bigotry is simply a matter of fact
sort of thing, and expresses itself in all kinds of
ways (ways, I reckon, even you are not immune to
falling victim of promolgating). The website posted,
which is not mine, was sent to remind us of just how
wrong-headed people can be, and lots of folks are, and
everybody, it seems, enjoys the position of victim or
of belonging to some group or another possessing some
unique perception with regards to suffering. I've seen
far more than you, probably spent more time in gay
bars around the world, sucking cock (as well), and
understand that educated people say all kinds of
terrible things, think things undisclosed which I find
to be more frightening. I'm not ready to ban books
like they do in Germany or throw people in jail for
saying that the Holocost never happened. Too, I think
I want to live in a world where my wife and I can
understand, plainly, that we have our own burdens to
work through, burdens once fully recognized might
position us better to honoring humanity.

This is very worrying:
"The last acceptable bigotry in America is to be against the working class."

I was thought that to work is a honorable privilege, honest earned bread has
to be on the table.

Hi Tod,

  I read Phil's post as an attempt at parody, though I didn't find it funny or creative in any regard.  You're right:  people attempt to mock very biased and extreme notions at risk of perpetuating the ideas -- mostly by default though.  I think (& perhaps this is too generous on my part?) people want to mock those idiotic ideals, but don't really go about doing so in any clever or inventive way.  It's almost as though they believe that simply repeating the extreme statements is enough to show how stupid those notions are (i.e. "only queers oppose the war" - extremists believe this wild notion as well as the opposite one that only queers support the war -- think Westboro Church).

  Honestly, I think your anger at Phil's post is moreover about the irresponsibility of following that tired old method of just repeating the idiocies, as though that would drive the point home and cause us to act --  doing so in such a simplistic fashion that he risks confirming the beliefs of any extremists on the list.  Phil didn't really employ any kind of imaginative use of language to point out something most of us on here didn't already know.  I mean, who doesn't know that in order to dismiss Ginsberg's anti-war sentiment (& the power his version held) one simply pulls an ad hominem attack focused on his being gay or Jewish?  We get it, we've heard it over and over, and it still isn't funny to hear it mocked.  And sorry, but the same stale old mockery won't call anyone to action in an effort to oppose the war.  Were we supposed to get angry that Ginsberg has been dismissed in the past and he continued to audibly oppose the war?  Were we then suppose to feel guilt
 that he did so in the face of such miserable dismissals of his character?  I'm sorry, Phil, but I'm trying to guess the intended trajectory of your parody, the effect was supposed to cause ...

  So what works?  Well, on this list, I'm going out on a limb here to say that we're probably all in close proximity on the belief scale of "live and let live", even if we don't "condone" certain behaviors within our "personal" lives.  Hell, most of America is, if you ask the general public.  There is a general consensus in our democracy that we should all share certain rights by birth, and any favoritism or uneven distribution of civil rights is ludicrous.  So how do we go about determing and enacting what Phil might have been attempting to provoke?  An action towards demanding those rights?  Making the poets speak out and oppose the war?   Do something to stop it?  There are multiple ways that don't always have immediate and obvious effects, but we can see the tide is changing now.

  As far as opposing anti-gay sentiment goes, an issue Phil perhaps didn't intend to invoke but is mixed up in here just the same, that's a seemingly bottomless can of worms that we can't seem to get a lid on.  Anti-gay sentiment is actively promoted by the religious right, by very liberal heterosexuals, and even subtly within the gay community itself (though I'm not going to start my own gay bashing campaign here by identifying how).  How do we respond to the absurd logic of it all?  Little by little in classrooms, through media, in conversation, writing letters to *our* representatives, via comedy, etc.  I like Larry Black's response to the political right's proclamation that "Homosexuality is a threat to the American family":  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WW6AFu1RF0  - his final scenario isn't politically correct, but it draws attention, in an artificial and crude way (that's also somewhat clever), to the absurdity of this slogan.  Ah, comedy:  always about something
 serious. The great leveler, etc.  But not all comedy is successful, eh?

  I mentioned the Westboro church before -- even a Fox News anchor tries to respond to these idiots by turning their language in on them -- "You are an abomination!"  No show-stopping intellectual arguments here:  just a nice little twist, that I'm sure was unplanned, but worthwhile just the same.  The Australian guy, also far from behaving in a politically correct fashion, takes the extermist's over-preached and worn-out abstract notion that homosexuality is bad by invading the extermist's comfort zone:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cN2pB3MCE   No great shakes, but it's nice to see the confident foundation of dogmatic preaching grow extremely uncomfortable in the face of what he knows is "bad" and not know what to do with it up close.  The self-proclaimed Man of God runs to get his mommy, poor baby.

  Anyway, I'm not coming up with stellar examples here - but I'd say this issue is larger than whether or not Phil made it clear if he were joking or not.  I think the issue is about the effectiveness of his joke, whether or not his purpose was recognized, if his cause were taken up by a few or more, and if there are dangers in his methodology (as noted by Tod).

  In my humble (and perhaps, singular) opinion, this debate warrants much more attention because it speaks to the even larger issue of how do we get messages across and believed on a larger scale.  If I got mad every time I heard someone jokingly dismiss certain views because a bitch or a dyke or an oppressed woman held them, no matter how lame or misguided the attempt, I'd be in a state of perpetual anger -- and an ineffective citizen.

  My twenty five and a half cents,

  Amy King

  p.s.  I'm a fan of the motto, "If it's a joke, we should both be laughing."  etc.

Thank you, Michael Tod Edgerton, and Mark Salerno, for your sense on this
matter. I think a lot of us saw that Primeau post in horror, and just quit
reading. If he was joking, it was a really bad joke. Your responses have
been clear and entirely justified. I hope a lot of people on this list
support what you have to say.

  I just re-read Tod’s post and my own, and I realized that I basically reiterated his main points without actually addressing the immediate and obvious issue at hand:  the acceptability of homophobia in whatever form, joke or sermon, it arrives in.

  Phil invoked homophobic sentiment in his post for a cause he hasn’t clarified yet.  The optimist in me thinks he did so to inspire action against the war somehow.  The poet in me dismissed it as a lame effort.  The human in me ignored the implications of employing homophobia as a tool, once again.

  Regardless of Phil's purpose, his invocation of homophobia does speak mountains about the acceptability of anti-gay sentiment in this country, as Tod aptly pointed out.  Beyond curtailing offensive remarks, I don’t think we have even begun to examine the ways in which we enact and incorporate our biases.  Nor do we want to, especially when the immediate repercussions don’t pertain to us directly or have bearing on our own safety.

  Tod has a very strong point that I find myself in total agreement with (though I’m slow in response by my own conditioned lack of – and numbed --  awareness):  Phil has not clarified his position, and by default, appears to be okay with the idea that others may read his remarks as homophobic.

  Additional listserve members have responded to Tod’s initial post of query with more mockery, as though Tod’s anger and fear weren’t justified by the anti-gay climate and society we live in.  Instead, he was, in turn, mocked for not ‘getting it,’ thus creating another sect of righteous elitism (I.e. “We understand the parody; he’s just too sensitive”).  Since then, he has clarified why he was so distraught by Phil’s post with some very real and harsh reasons -- and Phil and his defenders respond with the ease of silence.

  How sad that a few words from Phil, and a few less from some insensitive others, could have cleared the air on the list many posts ago.  How sad that I didn’t bat an eye at the language Phil invoked because I just thought his “joke” was flat and didn’t even think about the weight of using, yet again, more homophobic language in such an ineffective way that might be problematic.

  I’m no censor, but I do know, from experience, that none of us is above examining the ways in which we might be homophobic and perpetuate that kind of hate – but such an examination requires a suppression of pride and an acknowledgement that we are, to some degree, products of our environment.  That acknowledgment also requires we assume responsibility for the language we use and the necessary explanations when we are misunderstood, even when people assume our good intentions.

  I grew up in a culture where racism was finely-woven into the fabric of the reality that I knew.  When I moved north, I chose to commit to an extreme self-examination of the ways in which racism informed my behaviors and the things I said.  I learned by trial and error, and very often, that required me to be humble.  I’ve had to explain myself, apologize, and feel embarrassed by my own fallibility.

  So have I purged myself of my racist beliefs?  Hell no.  Even recently, I found myself questioning a very subtle lens I was viewing a friend through.  I had to re-think something even deeper in relation to a racist notion I didn’t even realize I harbored.  But I’m a liberal who believes in speaking out against stereotypes and demanding inalienable rights across the board!  But my intellect doesn’t mean I’m exempt from holding people beside the looking glass of this cultures’ firmly-planted racism – and therefore, I’m not above examining my own behaviors.  This same argument holds true for my own homophobia.

  Okay, this is getting too sermon-like, apologies, but as I mentioned and Tod has already clearly noted, I really don’t believe we’ve developed any kind of awareness of just how perpetuated and acceptable homophobia is, even among us joking liberals.  Mock those absurdities all you want, but until we get some sort of handle on the very real and complex system of homophobia, we should at least make a conscious effort to be sensitive when it comes to employing insurrectionary tools that use that derogatory language, and that of any other “ism”.

Wow Phil you got me on this one! And thanks for telling me why I've been
marginalized. I suppose you fight your battles on the streets - not like
the rest of us chained to our computers.

Of course we're pathetic, and you're right on calling us on it!

And your motto - that 'prick' comment - terrific. Love the anatomical
issue, and the little woman with the bun in the oven appreciates it too.

"SUPPOSED oppression"?!? Tell Mathew Shepard's or Brandon Teena's family that they're making too big a deal out of their loved one's "supposed oppression". Tell that to anyone who's been gaybashed, who's gone through months or even years of "conversion" therapy, of painful denial and self-hatred, whose families and friends have turned their backs on them.

And *I'm* the "self-righteous prick"? So everyone who's ever spoken out about oppression should just shut up and stop being self-righteous pricks, or does that only apply to those speaking out against that oppression which only affects the mere "3%" (not accurate--not that any such statistic could be) who, therefore, as you seem to feel, simlply don't matter? You fucking asshole!

I think this post makes your bigoted views crystal clear, and none of us "3 percenters" on the list (though where are they all now?!?) should have to deal with this bullshit.

I certainly wish I hadn't read your post at all!

What else can I, in my "self-righteous" anger, say to you: Go to hell.

And for the rest of the list--NO, it is NOT best to simply ignore these people. I frankly resent being told--privately--to be quiet and let it "just go away" (the problem doesn't just go away). Certainly, for my own well-being, I need both to express my anger and, then, let it go.

James Baldwin, from "Notes for a Native Son":

Hatred, which could destroy so much, never failed to destroy the man [sic] who hated and this was an immutable law.
          It began to seem that one would have to hold in the mind forever two ideas which seemed in opposition. The first was acceptance, the acceptance, totally without rancor, of life as it is, and men as they are: in the light of this idea, it goes without saying that injustice is a commonplace. But this did not mean that one could be complacent, for the second idea was of equal power: that one must never, in one's own life, accept these injustices as commonplace but must fight them with all one's strength. This fight begins, however, in the heart and it now had been laid to my charge to keep my own heart free of hatred and despair.

I think this episode, and countless others like it on the Poetics
list, can be understood pretty easily.

The notion of political correctness, and the whole tedious right-wing
mobilization
against it, gives fundamentally cruel people the option of seeing
themselves as brave crusaders against oppression or clear-eyed
seekers of truth.

In any particular case, the person may actually think of himself as a
courageous free speech hero; most of the time, it's simply the
cynical deployment of a convenient defense.

Typically, we--the left--respond with earnest efforts at self-
analysis,  considerations of the  stakes of satire, admissions of the
value of free speech, etc, etc.  We assume that the person in
question is acting in good faith.  End result?  Much wasted time.

I think Edgerton's question deserves an answer.  If we're doomed to
be cast as humorless censors, then why not play the part?  Is this a
moderated list, or isn't it?  In a sense, we currently have the worst
of both worlds....

[Please forward this message to all interested parties!]

Atticus/Finch is honored to present you, dear readers, with our ninth
chapbook production of poems for readers of poetry, John
Taggart’s "Unveiling/Marianne Moore" (a book of poems).

Taggart’s work is as much meditative biography (interestingly charged
with the eros and wonder of a reader shook to fidelity and held there
by a lifelong effort at interface and understanding) as it is
investigative reflection on practice and place. Taggart’s pattern-
writing strips the figure of its cultural residue, unveiling the
troubled relationship between homage, mentorship, and aufhebung,
working Moore’s "bios" through an intimate subjectivization founded on
syntactical disruption, insistence, and circularity. Taggart’s
shifting sense of "relating to" adds propulsion to the poem’s many
registers (fragmented stutters and long lines), pushing by
paradigmatic degrees of thinking-forth-back-and-between. The
subsequent score shows the marks of a master’s marginalia superimposed
on the specter of a marginalized master. A hyphen that proves,
perhaps, Nietzsche’s dictum that true homage betrays the master: here
Taggart "betrays," not by infidelity or treachery, but by baring,
exposing—-making manifest.

Visit our website, www.atticusfinch.org, to read sample poems and take
a look at the cover (click on the book’s title for all the details).
We’re still working on getting Pay Pal (I know, I know!), so, until
then, all books are mail order only.

To obtain a copy, send $8 (well-concealed cash, check, or money order

Right on, Nick, Alan, Tod, Amy, Mark, others...

PP, your insensitivity really lowers the caliber of this list
environ.  More importantly, you're *hurting people*.  Now please
don't respond by saying that you don't give a shit. Each time you
post, things get worse.

Tod -- I'm sure you have the support of the vast majority on this
list.  Now, I don't think I want to see 1000 posts over the next day
or two corroborating this fact.  The list becomes untenable in that
event, ergo Nick's provocation.

At any rate, when we finally get to the point at which someone has
baited us into name-calling, esp. here online, not much good will
come of same.  I can't fault anyone for getting good and pissed, no.
But we probably could all stand a cooler rhetoric when confronted
with asshole behavior.

Oops.  You get the point.

Semper fi,

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes
competing interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with
our collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions or postings.

Phil Primeau has a track record of calling people names and looking for
attention through provocative remarks. That reflects not at all on his putative
targets and says a great deal about his own character. My  inclination is  to
not take the bait.  The man needs  attention.   I, for one, will deny it to
him.

I agree. On this list, at least, the horse has died.
By saying this, I don't at all mean to diminish
the wider relevance of hate/stupidity/bigotry
as an issue, but I don't read Poetics for that.

How about your reactions to
http://www.thecommonreview.org/spotlight.html
as it affects cultivating a readership for poetry?

I assume, from many posts here, that E. D. Hirsch, Jr.
may not seem relevant. I also assume that, in some
ways, the kinds of poetry many of us write today may
not require much in the way of background knowledge
for "comprehension," the "materiality" of the text having
supplanted the need for such sophistication with an appetite for a different
kind of sophistication (e.g.,
Gertrude Stein's, et seq.). Anyhow, this topic might
provoke a discussion of audience, at least, and of
the role of a basic understanding of grammar and of syntax in order to
appreciate their innovative warping as strenghthening corrugation of the
materia poetica.

Time to shift gears?

This is a serious question, and maybe an attempt to direct this exchange in a more useful and interesting direction. Phil's original remark wasn't
directed at any one person, but it has met with specific calls like this one against him as a person, many of which have even invoked 'list policy' as
a reason for censuring him. I personally don't think such things are useful, and that the level of outrage directed at Phil's admittedly bad joke have
not been commensurate with the outrageousness of his initial statement which to me was obviously a sort of satire of the kinds of gung ho patriotism
that have been so common in political discourse over the last couple of years. to me, the whole thing looks like an attack on the parodist rather than
the subject he's parodying, and that seems very misguided to me.

to Matthew tod Edgerton's and others points, what i find very discouraging on a list full of people who are engaged with language at the level of
poetry, many of whom make a living by teaching people about poetry, is that there seems to be so little understanding that the parody Phil posted was
not aimed at homosexuals, but rather at the blockheads who equate homosexuality with weakness and cowardice. Now, that equation itself has a certain
kind of cultural currency, the underlying assumptions of which are not anti-gay so much as they are anti-woman. to whit: being sexually attracted to
men is a feminine characteristic, therefore men who exhibit the trait are feminine and not masculine and therefore lack the strength, bravery, and
power of masculinity. The logic of the belief system is terribly flawed, but when it goes unanalyzed it has the force of stereotypical caricatures of
the swishy queen obsessed with musical theater, the shrieking 'girlish' ( a word i dislike, but use for lack of a better one) man who appears to
aspire to the traditional female archetype of damsel in distress. Such images have long been the object of masculine scorn, and i think that satirical
treatments of that scorn such as the one in phil's initial post are therefore useful and serve a good end by revealing the barrenness of the
underlying cultural logic. Self-righteously smacking down the effort because in the effort taboo words were used (which is my impression) is therefore
counterproductive and only serves to reinforce other rightwing stereotypes of hypersensitive, overeducated politically correct liberals who have
little to no contact with 'the real world' and are therefore not worth listening to.

I have nothing more to say on the subject. Please commence to tell me I'm an insensitive bigot for disagreeing with the consensus view that Phil
Primeau's remarks were the remarks of an insensitive bigot.

Dear Poetics List subscribers:

Can someone here kindly post or contact me directly with the names of
the people responsible for this list, its maintenance, operation,
moderation and publishing standards, and how one might contact them to
begin a dialogue?

In recent years this once exceptional academic list has deteriorated
into a haven for libel and slander. I can no longer keep silent. Because
I have been a member of this list (and also a direct victim of the libel
it continues to tolerate) and this list chooses to syndicate its content
on all the search engines and throughout the internet my name through my
signature and other list members citation of my name has made my
identity irrevocably associated with the content appearing here. In
short, this list has become a source of professional embarrassment for
me and a serious liability in professional advancement.

There are messages the list has allowed which attack my person and use
my name in malicious ways knowing that the content will appear on the
internet through the search engines. It is truly hurtful and harmful to
my person to see this happening and yet I know that others have been
targeted for defamation, slander and libel even worse than myself. I
hope this message reaches them wherever they are and that they too can
join a dialogue to discuss how to repair these very serious mistakes
that have allowed malicious content to be published on this public list.

I think the best thing to do is to recognize that libel, slander and
defamation does indeed get published on this list and to agree that this
is not acceptable when the list is very public and deliberately
syndicated throughout the internet and the search engines. We should use
this thread on the list to make these admissions.

The next thing we should do is look at the mechanisms available to us to
correct the damage and discuss options to repair it.

I'm not sure who runs this list. There is a generic message (the
"welcome message") which occasional appears and contains rules and
regulations of use but never in the many years that I have been a member
of this list have I seen any enactment of those rules even as those
rules are sometimes broken daily. If anything, the "welcome message" is
reposted with more frequency as the only method available to list owners
to moderate the malicious activity which occurs on the list.

Certainly if the executive officers of the university and its associated
schools were made aware of even a sprinkling of some of the content it
is publishing on this list it would shut-down the list in a heartbeat. I
hope we can bring structure and reason to bear in an effort to avoid
this (because eventually that would happen) and salvage, rebuild, and
reclaim what was, again, once a proud literary resource.

Please don't pollute this thread with unhelpful comments. Let's pull our
boots up by the straps and not be afraid to admit our mistakes in an
effort to support and be a resource for everyone. The Poetics List has

pp must have been joking.  Poetry IS gay.  If you took those three
letters out of poetry, poetry would be heartbroken.  And not in a good
way, i.e., a way that could ever be productive.  But in an as in *dead*
way.

Hi Tod,

  I read Phil's post as an attempt at parody, though I didn't find it
funny or creative in any regard.  You're right:  people attempt to mock
very biased and extreme notions at risk of perpetuating the ideas --
mostly by default though.  I think (& perhaps this is too generous on my
part?) people want to mock those idiotic ideals, but don't really go
about doing so in any clever or inventive way.  It's almost as though
they believe that simply repeating the extreme statements is enough to
show how stupid those notions are (i.e. "only queers oppose the war" -
extremists believe this wild notion as well as the opposite one that
only queers support the war -- think Westboro Church).

  Honestly, I think your anger at Phil's post is moreover about the
irresponsibility of following that tired old method of just repeating
the idiocies, as though that would drive the point home and cause us to
act --  doing so in such a simplistic fashion that he risks confirming
the beliefs of any extremists on the list.  Phil didn't really employ
any kind of imaginative use of language to point out something most of
us on here didn't already know.  I mean, who doesn't know that in order
to dismiss Ginsberg's anti-war sentiment (& the power his version held)
one simply pulls an ad hominem attack focused on his being gay or
Jewish?  We get it, we've heard it over and over, and it still isn't
funny to hear it mocked.  And sorry, but the same stale old mockery
won't call anyone to action in an effort to oppose the war.  Were we
supposed to get angry that Ginsberg has been dismissed in the past and
he continued to audibly oppose the war?  Were we then suppose to feel
guilt
 that he did so in the face of such miserable dismissals of his
character?  I'm sorry, Phil, but I'm trying to guess the intended
trajectory of your parody, the effect was supposed to cause ...

  So what works?  Well, on this list, I'm going out on a limb here to
say that we're probably all in close proximity on the belief scale of
"live and let live", even if we don't "condone" certain behaviors within
our "personal" lives.  Hell, most of America is, if you ask the general
public.  There is a general consensus in our democracy that we should
all share certain rights by birth, and any favoritism or uneven
distribution of civil rights is ludicrous.  So how do we go about
determing and enacting what Phil might have been attempting to provoke?
An action towards demanding those rights?  Making the poets speak out
and oppose the war?   Do something to stop it?  There are multiple ways
that don't always have immediate and obvious effects, but we can see the
tide is changing now.

  As far as opposing anti-gay sentiment goes, an issue Phil perhaps
didn't intend to invoke but is mixed up in here just the same, that's a
seemingly bottomless can of worms that we can't seem to get a lid on.
Anti-gay sentiment is actively promoted by the religious right, by very
liberal heterosexuals, and even subtly within the gay community itself
(though I'm not going to start my own gay bashing campaign here by
identifying how).  How do we respond to the absurd logic of it all?
Little by little in classrooms, through media, in conversation, writing
letters to *our* representatives, via comedy, etc.  I like Larry Black's
response to the political right's proclamation that "Homosexuality is a
threat to the American family":
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WW6AFu1RF0  - his final scenario isn't
politically correct, but it draws attention, in an artificial and crude
way (that's also somewhat clever), to the absurdity of this slogan.  Ah,
comedy:  always about something
 serious. The great leveler, etc.  But not all comedy is successful, eh?

  I mentioned the Westboro church before -- even a Fox News anchor tries
to respond to these idiots by turning their language in on them -- "You
are an abomination!"  No show-stopping intellectual arguments here:
just a nice little twist, that I'm sure was unplanned, but worthwhile
just the same.  The Australian guy, also far from behaving in a
politically correct fashion, takes the extermist's over-preached and
worn-out abstract notion that homosexuality is bad by invading the
extermist's comfort zone:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8cN2pB3MCE
No great shakes, but it's nice to see the confident foundation of
dogmatic preaching grow extremely uncomfortable in the face of what he
knows is "bad" and not know what to do with it up close.  The
self-proclaimed Man of God runs to get his mommy, poor baby.

  Anyway, I'm not coming up with stellar examples here - but I'd say
this issue is larger than whether or not Phil made it clear if he were
joking or not.  I think the issue is about the effectiveness of his
joke, whether or not his purpose was recognized, if his cause were taken
up by a few or more, and if there are dangers in his methodology (as
noted by Tod).

  In my humble (and perhaps, singular) opinion, this debate warrants
much more attention because it speaks to the even larger issue of how do
we get messages across and believed on a larger scale.  If I got mad
every time I heard someone jokingly dismiss certain views because a
bitch or a dyke or an oppressed woman held them, no matter how lame or
misguided the attempt, I'd be in a state of perpetual anger -- and an
ineffective citizen.

  My twenty five and a half cents,

  Amy King

  p.s.  I'm a fan of the motto, "If it's a joke, we should both be
laughing."  etc.

Jason, I hear you.  But someone who writes

"feigning moral outrage over the supposed 'oppression' suffered by
the 3% of our society"

is not operating satirically.  Or am I missing something?  If the
satire seemed clumsy to some of us, it's possibly b/c behind it lay
this kind of attitude.

Now if I'm wrong about this, I'm willing to say so.  But that would
require that PP admit to caring about those identified via his
"satire" as targets of scorn -- among which are gays.

OK?  This really isn't rocket science.  All PP has to admit to is
caring about the situation that Tod so passionately decries.  And
that's real easy to do.  Real easy.

Best,

Joe

Nobody is just a caricature, Phil.  Someone said, and i paraphrase, that
the most boring actual person is much more complex than the most
interesting character from the literature.

But yeah, don't just be a poet.  Be an editor.  Listenlight

Dear George:

I know we haven't been in correspondence so much lately, but when I saw you invoke my name so directly, and on the POETICS list no less (hey -- this omniscience thing brings a lot to my attention), I thought I'd better clear something up.

I thought that everyone knew that part in my book where it says I gave those guys up to unclean lusts after one another was a parody.  We certainly got a big laugh out of it at the writers' conference.  I'm really sorry the joke hasn't come off so well these past few millennia.  I'm even sorrier to hear you're bored.  I think you'll find the next edition a whole lot clearer on this and just about every other subject.  Up here, we're astonished at what a tin ear most of you have for tone.  I suppose translation is part of the problem.

On the other hand, that part about me coming back soon was meant in all seriousness.  Y'all better start getting your ducks in a line.  You might start by treating one another as you would be treated.  I hope that part, at least, came across even in the Canadian Revised Standard Version.

Give my regards to all -- Remind them that I'm watching.

Yours,
God

 >>Tell that to anyone who's been gaybashed, who's gone through months
or even years of "conversion" therapy, of painful denial and
self-hatred, whose families and friends have turned their backs on them.


Tod makes a good point, but there's no really sense privileging being
gay or female or disabled or of minority ethnicity. There's no sense in
privileging being bookish or smarter or exceedingly average or
exceptionally beautiful or exceedingly stupid.

Everybody suffers and gets picked on ... and the degree to which they
suffer or get picked on is not necessarily a function of their "group"
identification. All kinds of people get bashed, and when they get
bashed, they get bashed as individuals, not groups. Tanya gets bashed or
Tony gets bashed, and their blood on the sidewalk is an individual's
blood, not the blood of some Platonic "group." Not gay blood or straight
blood or ethnic blood ... an individual's blood.

In fact, these Gramscian notions of "group rights" trumping "individual
rights" probably do more harm than good. They fragment an already
fragmented people ... bitter little enclaves hypersensitive to their
oppressed group identity, facing off against the "oppressive master
narrative" that is in reality our cumulative culture.

All of which is not to argue against sensitivity or the prosecution of
hate crimes, but rather to argue against the labels through which
sensitivity is dispensed. All these Gramscian labels, these group
sensitivities, are, paradoxically, desensitizing to our universal fear
and vulnerability. Instead of emphasizing the ways we cannot understand
each other ("you as a nonchessplayer cannot possibly understand the
suffering and alienation I, as a chessplayer, have endured in mainstream
America") perhaps we would be better served by emphasizing the ways we
can understand each other ... as individuals.

Cold comfort to someone who's been bashed for being perceived as "gay,"
but again, and this is the point, cold comfort to that individual.

There are still lots of acceptable forms of bigotry.  Making fun of fat
people.  (New Eddie Murphy movie anyone?)  Making fun of the working class.
(I know exactly what you mean and have ranted against it at more than one
piece of theatre.) Fag jokes.  It's always tempting to chime in with which
bigotry is still most prevalent or still acceptable, but then we risk
getting sucked into what I call "suffering contests."

All bigotry is bullshit whether it's "socially acceptable" or not. It's
maybe more depressing when it's socially acceptable . . .

I didn't see the original post at the time because I'm so swamped with work,
so now I'm kind of behind in the whole thing.  But from the repost in the
response, surely it had to be meant as an ironic rant about the
marginalization of poetry and the marginalized people who write it.  I say
surely as in I certainly hope so anyway . . . I suppose this is where text
alone fails us--irony vs. sincere bigotry get hard to sort out without
winks, gestures, tones of voice.

The last acceptable bigotry in America is to be against the working class.

for anyone who has been hurt by those exchanges. But the futurist manifesto
included a phrase against feminism which no one mentioned--but they were
against everything in that adolescent male way that can be revolutionary or
hurtful or fun or all 3. There weren't exactly hordes of writers defending
women in the last exchanges abt that so don't start criticizing women now!
we need to support each other.

It's not my feelings I'm concerned about, it's public perception based
on search engine results. I've tried my best to do good things for this
list and offer good resources and be nice to people but so often I get
side-swiped by malicious stuff that just has no place that sometimes,
yes, I get uneven and write out some anger but never ever against
another person's identity. I find that gross. If you want to belittle
someone you shouldn't use their full name and if you do yes people
should have some rights and they do. This list states in its welcome
message that it is private and I accepted that so that's why I'm upset
that I'm finding things now in the search engines which connect me with,
well, from an outside view by sane ordinary people, content and smears
which doesn't do much at all to recommend me. I'm sorry if I'm being too
forward here that's just me posturing from bad circumstance but I'd like
some indication of what is truly going on and what the real policy is
beyond social cliqueness. ps. glad you survived china alex i miss that

I've never seen anything that seemed slanderous against any particular

somehow.

I apparently miss everything.

Subject: Poetics List

Dear Poetics List subscribers:

Can someone here kindly post or contact me directly with the names of
the people responsible for this list, its maintenance, operation,
moderation and publishing standards, and how one might contact them to
begin a dialogue?

In recent years this once exceptional academic list has deteriorated
into a haven for libel and slander. I can no longer keep silent. Because
I have been a member of this list (and also a direct victim of the libel
it continues to tolerate) and this list chooses to syndicate its content
on all the search engines and throughout the internet my name through my
signature and other list members citation of my name has made my
identity irrevocably associated with the content appearing here. In
short, this list has become a source of professional embarrassment for
me and a serious liability in professional advancement.

There are messages the list has allowed which attack my person and use
my name in malicious ways knowing that the content will appear on the
internet through the search engines. It is truly hurtful and harmful to
my person to see this happening and yet I know that others have been
targeted for defamation, slander and libel even worse than myself. I
hope this message reaches them wherever they are and that they too can
join a dialogue to discuss how to repair these very serious mistakes
that have allowed malicious content to be published on this public list.

I think the best thing to do is to recognize that libel, slander and
defamation does indeed get published on this list and to agree that this
is not acceptable when the list is very public and deliberately
syndicated throughout the internet and the search engines. We should use
this thread on the list to make these admissions.

The next thing we should do is look at the mechanisms available to us to
correct the damage and discuss options to repair it.

I'm not sure who runs this list. There is a generic message (the
"welcome message") which occasional appears and contains rules and
regulations of use but never in the many years that I have been a member
of this list have I seen any enactment of those rules even as those
rules are sometimes broken daily. If anything, the "welcome message" is
reposted with more frequency as the only method available to list owners
to moderate the malicious activity which occurs on the list.

Certainly if the executive officers of the university and its associated
schools were made aware of even a sprinkling of some of the content it
is publishing on this list it would shut-down the list in a heartbeat. I
hope we can bring structure and reason to bear in an effort to avoid
this (because eventually that would happen) and salvage, rebuild, and
reclaim what was, again, once a proud literary resource.

Please don't pollute this thread with unhelpful comments. Let's pull our
boots up by the straps and not be afraid to admit our mistakes in an
effort to support and be a resource for everyone. The Poetics List has
lost its way and must reacquire its sense of direction. How do we
achieve this? Do you agree it's necessary? What is the next step?

Sincerely and without malice,

Derek Rogerson
Poetics List Subscriber

**Friday, February 2, 7:30pm**

Jillian Peña (US) - The Promised Land
Filled with hope, The Promised Land is a dance piece
about love, desire, restlessness, and ambition.
Expressions escape the body in forms such as ecstatic
dancing, meditation, sex, and emotions.  The dance
responds to the anxiety felt somewhere between
expectation and failure.  Chicagoan Jillian Peña is a
video maker, dancer, improviser, negotiator, and
writer, and this performance was made while in
residency at The Kitchen, NYC. www.jillianpena.com

Loss Pequeño Glazier (US) - Bromeliasas
Exploring new possibilities for web-based digital art,
Bromeliasas is a computer-selected rendering of text
and images extracted from poetry databases.  Glazier's
digital poetry also engages with sound, photography,
and video; and includes themes of ecology, Latin
American landscapes, and the delicate but tangible
thread of language.  Buffalo (NY) based Glazier is a
poet, and Founder and Director of the Electronic
Poetry Center, the world's most extensive Web-based
digital poetry resource, housed at the State
University of New York.
www.epc.buffalo.edu/authors/glazier

Brian O' Reilly (US) - Weather Mechanics
Weather Mechanics connects sound to moving image. The
work is constructed by analog video, where projected
images bleed onto one another, intersecting and
blurring their lines like layered, waterlogged paper.
Currently working as an Artist in Residence at ZKM in
Karlsruhe, Germany, Brian O'Reilly is the creator of
various works for sound, moving images, multi media
assemblage/installation, and is a double bassist.

**Saturday, February 3, 7:30pm**

octal hatch, a collection of miniature abstract audio
and video portraits of Greek composer Iannis Xenakis;
and scan processor studies, developed in collaboration
with Woody Vasulka, and including improvisations with
experimental sound composer Robb Drinkwater.

jUStin!katKO (US)  - flesh
fleSh is a music-video-talk performance that works
with a generative principle derived from a study of
songs on the first disc of Queen's Greatest Hits.  The
performance consists of two parts: 1) a hack of the
source; 2) what Fallujah learned about White
Phosphorous in November 2004; and an epilogue, The
Ants, Sir, that will be underscored by a momentary
sound mix of Chicago FM radio.  jUStin!katKO is an
intermedia writer and publisher in Oxford, OH.
www.justin-katko.tk

Michael Graeve (AUS) - Simple Methods
Graeve works with old domestic and schoolroom record
players and loudspeakers, reveling in the volatile and
unpredictable nature of the equipment.  Rich tones,
textures, and rhythms fall together and fall apart,
evidencing simple interactions between machine process
and human gesture, with the limitations of the
technology producing complex results.  Michael Graeve
is an Australian artist living in Chicago, working in
painting and sound installation, performance and
composition.

**Sunday, February 4, 7:30pm**

Jillian Peña (US) - The Promised Land

Loss Pequeño Glazier (US) - Io Sono At Swoons
Following his presentation on Friday February 2,
Glazier presents a different work, which
electronically converts text from a database of
linguistic stems and words to generate sound and
poetry.  Along with English, fragments of multiple
languages are interwoven to produce a unique fabric of
sounds, sometimes humorous, often surprising in tone,
density, and color.

jUStin!katKO (US) - fleSh

**Friday, February 9, 7:30pm**

Galen Curwen-McAdams (US) - Diasporalities
Curwen-McAdams' writings and technological
interventions are driven by his theoretical
explorations and research into human and computer
languages, internet protocols, and network
architectures. Diasporalities is a performance of the
routes, traces, mappings, and gestures of bodies
traversing networks. Curwen-McAdams is a graduate of
the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, who
currently lives in Portland, Oregon.
www.diaspor.alities.info

jonCates + jake elliot (US) - 0UR080R05
jonCates + jake elliott embark on a realtime audio
video performance, where digital systems coil into
themselves, creating a speculative screenplay,
virtually typewritten onto the raw 16mm film footage
of William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin. Chicago-based
artists jonCates + jake elliott collaborate on various
initiatives involving artware-radical, conceptual
software engineered or hacked/modified by artists.

Tyne Dogger artist
Caroline Bergvall (UK) - FIG REDUCTION
Caroline Bergvall presents a series of textual pieces
based around her recent book FIG. Incorporating video
projections and her virtuoso reading technique, this
is poetry of complex language and engaged thought.
Bergvall is a poet, performance artist, and critic
based in London, noted for her pointed as well as
playful tugging at identities and prejudices as they
are manifested in language.  She is co-Chair of
Writing, Milton Avery School of the Arts.

Tyne Dogger artist
Marisa Zanotti (UK) - Edges
In her new performance Edges, Brighton/Glasgow-based
Marisa Zanotti combines material from her earlier
dance piece, Wipe Out, with projected images to blur
the definitions of performance and film: considering
the film set a performance space, and filmmaking as a
performance.  In addition to performance, Zanotti
works in film drama, and her first short, At the end
of the sentence, has been shown at many international
film festivals.

Mark Booth (US) - this is the sound of the milky way
(projective version)
Mark Booth's new audio project combines text with live
and pre-recorded sound, to investigate the natural
environment, the limits of electronics, and physical
presence in the world.  Booth's recordings include
phenomena which can be recorded with a conventional
microphone (water, rain, wind, speech), and phenomena
which cannot (the milky way, the sun, the moon).  Mark
Booth works with sound, text and painting, and is
based in Chicago; he curated the festival An
Incomplete Map of Everything for Links Hall in 2006.

electronic instruments that blend processes of
feedback, resonance, and recording into
electro-acoustic improvisations.  Influenced by the
writings of Kenneth Maue and the audio work of David
Tudor, Alvin Lucier, and Nic Collins, Lonergan
performs here with a modified 1950s Lowry Tube Organ
Bench-a seat that has been modified to become an
instrument.  Lonergan studied experimental music and
composition at the School of the Art Institute of
Chicago, and now lives in Davenport, Iowa.

**Friday, February 16, 7:30pm**

Tyne Dogger artist
Donna Rutherford (UK) - Ochone Ochone
Glasgow-based performance artist Donna Rutherford
looks at how people overcome and move on from tragedy,
or, in contrast, the effects of avoidance and
repression.  Ochone refers to "sorrows from before
that are still with us," and this emotional work
references the Kurdish Iraqi community in Glasgow.
www.donnarutherford.org

Tyne Dogger artist
TNWK (UK) - Nurse Trash
In 1999, TNWK "destroyed" 100 books; they have been
working with the "remains" ever since, creating an
ongoing series of thought-provoking and visually
seductive performances that combine film, text, and

Dana Vinger & Robyn Okrant (US) - (nervous) system
Separated by geography and time zones, theater and
performance artists Vinger (Portland) and Okrant
(Chicago) find commonality in the systems that
overwhelm their lives.  They weave a tapestry of
spoken language from original and found texts that
address both personal and public concerns, including
the corporate ideology that shapes and fuels America's
urban public education system, and a patient's
struggles in a sea of red tape, chronic pain, and
stifling amounts of conflicting medical advice.

Goat Island (US) - Lasting, part one
Goat Island Performance Group, the art students of
Northside College Prep, and special musical guest
Smokey Hormel, present a multi-media collaborative
performance in celebration of lastness.  Goat Island

ways to changes in its poetic labyrinth.  Azevedo was
born in São Paulo, Brazil; an artist, graphic
designer, poet and musician, he is also a Doctor of

A new solo performance, in which a body is moved to
confess or at least commit to making it all up.
Wright's performance is something like she imagines
writing a blog would be if she could only bear the
thought of turning up in so many other people's lives
at once.  Based in Newcastle, UK, Fiona Wright is
known for her stylized and functional choreography,
combined with a personalized vein of writing.

The Disappearance of Latitude: Live Presence and
Realtime in Contemporary Practices
A two-day symposium
This symposium brings together theorists and
practitioners from a variety of backgrounds to present
lectures and participate in discussions formulated
around the themes of "Live" and "Realtime," and topics
that arise from this convergence of terms.  As with
the OPENPORT performance series, the intention of the
symposium is to group speakers from fields and
backgrounds that, while perhaps not normally exposed
to one another, may share a common vocabulary.  This
symposium is presented in collaboration with The
School of the Art Institute of Chicago's Performance
Department.

Here is a little 'how to' concerning using Winamp as an Internet radio
receiver that allows you to choose among thousands of Internet radio
stations all over the world, search them by any term you like, sort them in
several ways, and so on: http://vispo.com/radio .

Looking at the categories available, I don't see a 'poetry' or 'art' or
'culture' (etc.) category. The closest I see is "Talk".

I don't see a single Shoutcast radio station devoted to literary arts.
Please let me know if I'm missing it/them.

Hi -

I just wanted to drop a quick note drawing some added attention to the
new issue of COMBATIVES - the low-fi print companion to H_NGM_N -
http://www.h-ngm-n.com

The new issue, Vol 1 #3, features a series of exquisite corpse poems by
Sarah Lilius & Erin M. Bertram.

http://www.h-ngm-n.com/combatives/

Physically, COMBATIVES is side-stapled & sharply photocopied - each
issue only costs $2 & I'll send up to 3 copies so you can spread them
around to interested folks.  H_NGM_N itself started as a side-stapled
mimic of Ted Berrigan's C & then went online & got bigger & COMBATIVES
is, in some ways, my attempt to return to that earlier aesthetic.  The
whole run of COMBATIVES Vol. 1 will be 6 numbers, each issue featuring a
single author.  The first 2 have sold out already & #3 is on the way to
being gone.  Sometime in the fall, I'll collect all 6 in book format &
make it available POD on the site.

For now, the idea is to create some buzz - to put some quality in the
hands of anyone who wants it.

H_NGM_N also produces a series of print chapbooks - check out the site
for H_NGM_N B_ _KS: http://www.h-ngm-n.com/h_ngm_n-b__ks/ =20

Any poetics list member who orders a chapbook will receive a free copy
of COMBATIVES Vol. 1 #3.  Just make sure to let me know in your paypal
order note, or by sending a check to me at the address below.

I tried to backchannel you about Inland Empire but didn't get through either time.  So here is my reaction to Inland Empire.  It is a fascinating, wonderful film.  If you haven't seen it yet, I hope you enjoy it.  Regards, Tom Savage

As part of our collaboration with UbuWeb, we've been experimenting with
UbuRadio. We haven't announced it widely be cause we're working out the
kinks in the system. It selects from and randomly streams over 1600
audio files from the Ubu archive. Please note that it is in a testing
stage and does have problems, but you can give it a try. The easist way
to access it is just open the stream through your media player. The
address is http://peacemaker.stat.wvu.edu/ubu_radio. Please send along
feedback - we know it has problems still, but we welcome hearing about
how it works for you. Right now its playing Jerome Rothenberg.

Here is a little 'how to' concerning using Winamp as an Internet radio
receiver that allows you to choose among thousands of Internet radio
stations all over the world, search them by any term you like, sort
them in
several ways, and so on: http://vispo.com/radio .

Looking at the categories available, I don't see a 'poetry' or 'art'
or
'culture' (etc.) category. The closest I see is "Talk".

I don't see a single Shoutcast radio station devoted to literary arts.
Please let me know if I'm missing it/them.

*United Artists Books*
http://www.unitedartistsbooks.com/

**United Artists Books (formerly Angel Hair Books) was founded in =20
1967. It is one of the oldest independent publishing companies in the =20
United States that focuses primarily on publishing books of poetry.

During the last 40 years we have published numerous books, many of =20
which are no longer in print. Among our authors are Robert Creeley, =20
James Schuyler, Alice Notley, David Rosenberg, Ron Padgett, Charlotte =20
Carter, Lorenzo Thomas, Tom Clark, Ted Berrigan, Bernadette Mayer, =20
Bill Berkson, Hannah Weiner, Anne Waldman, John Wieners, and Clark =20
Coolidge.

Some of the artists who have contributed covers to United =20
Artists/Angel Hair books are Philip Guston, Joe Brainard, Donna =20
Dennis, Alex Katz, James Rosenquist, George Schneeman, Amy =20
Trachtenberg, Louise Hamlin, Jim Dine, Martha Diamond, Emilie Clark, =20
Pamela Lawton, Rosemary Mayer, Sophia Warsh, and Anne Tardos.

The press has received numerous grants and awards from the National =20
Endowment for the Arts, the New York State Council on the Arts, the =20
Massachusetts Foundation for the Arts, and the Coordinating Council of =20
Literary Magazines. It has been our primary goal to publish poets =20
whose works are well known and well-respected within the poetry =20
community but unknown to a wider audience.

In an article in The Baltimore Sun a few years back, Andrei Codrescu =20
described United Artists as a small press "on the cutting edge of =20
American poetry for the last twenty years. The series of books by =20
United Artists is indispensable for any library collection or anyone =20
interested in the future of poetry."

*Performer Bios*

**Barbara Henning, is the author of two novels and six books of =20
poetry. MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY is forthcoming from United Artists. Another =20
collection of prose, THIRTY MILES TO ROSEBUD, is forthcoming from =20
Spuyten Duyvil. Other works include a series of photo-poem pamphlets; =20

Call out to Dan Z on that excellent review of Hirsch's new book.
Thanks for alerting us to this, Dan.

Here's the link again:

http://www.thecommonreview.org/spotlight.html

Anyone who's been struggling with these issues in the classroom will
find this of great interest. I can see the applicability, as Dan
suggests, to the study (and teaching) of poetry, but I need to let
the various registers of the discussion settle in a bit.  At the
moment, I must confess, I'm finding myself more drawn to the
pedagogical per se, maybe b/c I'm about to take another crack at
Olson tomorrow with a new group of undergrads.

Best,

Joe

Ooh! I have something to say that doesn't involve you-know-what.

Doing my best to sweep aside the question of the failures of the
contemporary American school -- a massive question I have no experience
with or original opinions on -- let's talk about Dan Z's question:

"Anyhow, this topic might provoke a discussion of audience, at least, and
of the role of a basic understanding of grammar and of syntax in order to
appreciate their innovative warping as strenghthening corrugation of the
materia poetica."

OK, I'm not sure I follow exactly what Dan is saying here, although I like
how it sounds and a definite naturalist A+ for the analogy between
corrugated cardboard or steel in engineering and the deformations of
language in the avant garde. Hardcore.

I'd venture that most of the poetry I read (and review on rhubarb)
requires not only a familiarity with certain experiences, but also a deep
familiarity with how they're talked about in various situations.

You can't just watch the baseball game: you have to listen to it on the
radio. I'd say a key component of much of the poetry I read by
contemporaries is that is it a response to other -- verbal -- perceptions.

This doesn't cover everything, definitely not the Objectivists (maybe
Neidecker?) But I think the idea of poetry as a distorted mirror for the
language of others -- even bumping up against Wittgensteinian notions of
philosophy-as-language-therapy -- is a definite thread in that sweater.

Poetry is huge. We're interested in poetry's ever-morphing
relationships with language, grammar, rhythm, metaphor, image..., but
we're interested in its relationship with other things, too: politics,
economics, theatre, video games, opera, popular music, religion. The
most compelling poetry is argumentative without being didactic,
political without being dogmatic.

Our hope is that as Idiolexicon grows, it will become a harbor for
serious argument and dialogue through poetry. Send responses to other
poems that have been featured in Idiolexicon. Send responses to other
poems that have not been featured in Idiolexicon. Send your notes from
yesterday's football game. Send your annotated version of the State of
the Union address. Send the rejection letter you'd send Harold Bloom
if you had the chance.

Poetry and short prose pieces, mainly poetry.

Slam poets are welcome here. Just don't break anything.

Send 3-7 poems, or one long poem. We're interested in doing longer
stints with sets of poems that we like, so it might be good to send
poems that fit together well.

Previously published is fine, if you tell us that it's been previously
published, and where.

Simultaneous subs are fine, just let us know if someone good accepts it.

If at all possible, send your poems in the body of your email. If
that's not possible, send your poems as a PDF file. If that's not
possible either, explain in your email why we should trust your Word
document not to have a virus in it.

We're also interested in mp3 recordings of featured poems
(studio-quality or live performance). Send files via yousendit.

Send submissions to submissions at idiolexicon dot com.

This is all an experiment. If we don't take your piece, it's not

There was also a fascinating interview with David Lynch about this movie and his years as a practitioner of transcendental meditation (yes, there is a connection) on an NPR program called Studio 360.  I believe this can be accessed at studio360.org.  The .org info is definitely correct since I have contacted the program at that address several times in the past; I'm just not certain if this program can be directly listened to yet as it was broadcast quite recently.  Regards, Tom Savage

Subject:      Spring readings at Parasol Unit, London
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Poetry evenings at Parasol Unit will resume this spring with Peter Cole and Tony Lopez on 3 March, Lyn Hejinian and Barrett Watten on 29 March and Michael Glover and Ernesto Priego on 5 June.

  Saturday, 3 March, 6 PM

        Peter Cole’s two books of poems originally published in the United States have now been published together as What Is Doubled: Poems 1981-1998 (Shearsman, 2005). He has also published many volumes of translations of medieval and contemporary Hebrew as well as Arabic poetry, for which he has won the TLS Translation Prize and the PEN-American Translation Award, among others. He lives in Jerusalem where he co-edits Ibis Editions, a press devoted to the literature of the Levant.
  Tony Lopez teaches at the University of Plymouth and is the author of many books and pamphlets of poetry including Devolution (The Figures, 2000), Data Shadow (Reality Street, 2000), and False Memory (Salt, 2003), which Robert Potts in the Guardian called "by far my favourite individual volume of poetry this year… a series of sonnet sequences collaging and remixing the white noise of 1990s Britain into a disorienting, sometimes hilarious, often sinister, and always satirical challenge." His most recent book is Meaning Performance: Essays in Poetry (Salt, 2006).



  Thursday, 29 March, 6:30 PM

      Lyn Hejinian is the author of many books, including Writing is An Aid to Memory (The Figures, 1978), My Life (third edition, Green Integer, 2002), Oxota: A Short Russian Novel (The Figures, 1991), and The Fatalist (Omnidawn, 2003). Her essays are collected in The Language of Inquiry (University of California Press, 2000). She was editor of Tuumba Press, 1976-84 and co-editor (with Barrett Watten) of Poetics Journal, 1981-99 and is now co-director of Atelos. A Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets, she teaches at the University of California, Berkeley.
  Barrett Watten is a poet and a professor of literature and cultural studies at Wayne State University in Detroit. He has published two volumes of literary and cultural criticism, of which The Constructivist Moment: From Material Text to Cultural Poetics (Wesleyan, 2003) was awarded the René Wellek Prize in 2004. His published works of poetry include Frame (1971-1990), published by Sun and Moon in 1997; Bad History (Atelos, 1998); and Progress/Under Erasure (Green Integer, 2004). Watten edited This, one of the central little magazines of the experimental writers who would be known as the Language school, and co-edited Poetics Journal, one of its theoretical venues. The Grand Piano, a multi-authored "experiment in collective autobiography" of the period, began serial publication in November 2006. Recently, he spent time in Germany as a Fulbright Fellow, at the University of Tübingen and in Berlin, where he wrote on visual art, performance, and cultural politics.



  Tuesday, 5 June, 6:30 PM

    Michael Glover has written art criticism for The Times, The Economist, The Independent, and The Financial Times, among others. He is the author of several books and chapbooks of poetry, including Amidst All This Debris (2001) and The Bead-Eyed Man (2000), both from Dagger Press, and Impossible Horizons (Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995). Of his new book, For the Sheer Hell of Living, to be published this year by San Marco Press, John Ashbery writes, "Michael Glover’s lines unspool gravely and efficiently with few commas like waves that know they are on the way to someplace but without making much fuss about it. They can be piercingly sad and hilariously wry, sometimes at the same time, as: ‘Someone loses the midge swat./ Many glasses are raised.’—this from a poem called ‘Few things happen.’ Few things happen here, true, but those that do are tremendously important even when tiny."
  Ernesto Priego is a Mexican poet, essayist, and translator presently living in London. He is the author of Not Even Dogs (Meritage Press, 2006) as well as the blogs "Never Neutral" (http://neverneutral.wordpress.com/) and "The Jainakú Project" (http://thejainakuproject.blogspot.com/). A recent interview with him can be found on Tom Beckett’s blog "E




    The readings are organized and introduced by Barry Schwabsky.

  Readings begin at 6:30 PM (except for Saturday, 3 March, which begins at 6 PM) and are free to the public. Parasol Unit is located at 14 Wharf Road, London N1, near the Old Street and Angel tube stations.

Check out Amy King's blog from maybe a month or so ago where she calls
attention to Lynch's program to introduce TM into the curricula for
public schools. He has a new book out called Catching the Big Fish:
Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity.

Montreal-born NICOLE BROSSARD, poet, novelist and essayist, twice
Governor General Award winner for her poetry (1974, 1984), member of
l'Acad=E9mie des lettres du Qu=E9bec and of La soci=E9t=E9 royale du Cana=
da,
is one of Quebec's most celebrated authors. For the more than thirty
books she has published since 1965, she has received the Prix Athanase-Da=
vid (1991), the highest prize in Quebec, for her entire
body of work, and the Molson Prize of the Canada Council (2006), the
most prestigious award in Canada, for her outstanding contribution to
the arts and humanities. Her many honours and awards from both
francophone and anglophone institutions in Canada include doctorates
from the University of Western Ontario (1991) and the Universit=E9 de
Sherbrooke (1997), the bp Nichol Chapbook Award (1986), le Grand Prix
de Po=E9sie du Festival international de Trois-Rivi=E8res (1989, 1999),
the Harbourfront Festival Prize (1991), Prix de la Soci=E9t=E9 des
=E9crivains canadiens (2002) and the W.O. Mitchell Prize (2003). Nicole
Brossard emerged as a leading figure of the new literary movement
which since the 1960s has revolutionized the forms and language of
poetry and fiction in Quebec through her work as founding co-editor of th=
e influential periodical La barre du jour (1965=961975) and of the
feminist periodical Les t=EAtes de pioche (1976=961979) and through her
contribution to feminist culture, confirmed with the film Some
American Feminists (1976), the acclaimed Anthologie de la po=E9sie des
femmes au Qu=E9bec (1991, 2003), and her role as President of the Third
International Feminist Book Fair (1988). Through her many appearances
as speaker or reader at conferences and festivals across Canada and
throughout the world, Brossard has significantly influenced
contemporary writing internationally, especially through the many
translations of her work into English and Spanish, and those of
individual works into German, Italian, Slovenian, Romanian, Japanese
and Afrikaans. Titles translated into English include Aerial Letter,
Baroque at Dawn, The Blue Books, Intimate Journal, Installations,
Lovhers, Mauve Desert, Museum of Bone and Water, These Our Mothers.
L'Horizon du fragment (2004, Ed. Trois-Pistoles) and Yesterday at the
Hotel Clarendon (2005, Coach House Books, S. de Lotbini=E8re Harwood,
trans) are her most recent books in French and English. Fluid

I'm sorry...I have to weigh in here. I believe that disabled people are the
most shunned in society. They are excluded from the media, and retinely
referred to in unacceptable language. Unemployment is near 70% because it is
so darn hard to get a job. I've suffered a life of discrimination in all
areas: work, lovers, children, every getting an apartment!!!!!!!!! And there
is no "affirmative action" for PWD.

Subject: Spring readings at Parasol Unit, London

Poetry evenings at Parasol Unit will resume this spring with Peter Cole =
and Tony Lopez on 3 March, Lyn Hejinian and Barrett Watten on 29 March =
and Michael Glover and Ernesto Priego on 5 June.=20
  =20
  Saturday, 3 March, 6 PM
  =20
        Peter Cole's two books of poems originally published in the =
United States have now been published together as What Is Doubled: Poems =
1981-1998 (Shearsman, 2005). He has also published many volumes of =
translations of medieval and contemporary Hebrew as well as Arabic =
poetry, for which he has won the TLS Translation Prize and the =
PEN-American Translation Award, among others. He lives in Jerusalem =
where he co-edits Ibis Editions, a press devoted to the literature of =
the Levant.
  Tony Lopez teaches at the University of Plymouth and is the author of =
many books and pamphlets of poetry including Devolution (The Figures, =
2000), Data Shadow (Reality Street, 2000), and False Memory (Salt, =
2003), which Robert Potts in the Guardian called "by far my favourite =
individual volume of poetry this year... a series of sonnet sequences =
collaging and remixing the white noise of 1990s Britain into a =
disorienting, sometimes hilarious, often sinister, and always satirical =
challenge." His most recent book is Meaning Performance: Essays in =
Poetry (Salt, 2006).
  =20


  Thursday, 29 March, 6:30 PM
  =20
      Lyn Hejinian is the author of many books, including Writing is An =
Aid to Memory (The Figures, 1978), My Life (third edition, Green =
Integer, 2002), Oxota: A Short Russian Novel (The Figures, 1991), and =
The Fatalist (Omnidawn, 2003). Her essays are collected in The Language =
of Inquiry (University of California Press, 2000). She was editor of =
Tuumba Press, 1976-84 and co-editor (with Barrett Watten) of Poetics =
Journal, 1981-99 and is now co-director of Atelos. A Chancellor of the =
Academy of American Poets, she teaches at the University of California, =
Berkeley.
  Barrett Watten is a poet and a professor of literature and cultural =
studies at Wayne State University in Detroit. He has published two =
volumes of literary and cultural criticism, of which The Constructivist =
Moment: From Material Text to Cultural Poetics (Wesleyan, 2003) was =
awarded the Ren=E9 Wellek Prize in 2004. His published works of poetry =
include Frame (1971-1990), published by Sun and Moon in 1997; Bad =
History (Atelos, 1998); and Progress/Under Erasure (Green Integer, =
2004). Watten edited This, one of the central little magazines of the =
experimental writers who would be known as the Language school, and =
co-edited Poetics Journal, one of its theoretical venues. The Grand =
Piano, a multi-authored "experiment in collective autobiography" of the =
period, began serial publication in November 2006. Recently, he spent =
time in Germany as a Fulbright Fellow, at the University of T=FCbingen =
and in Berlin, where he wrote on visual art, performance, and cultural =
politics.=20

  Tuesday, 5 June, 6:30 PM
  =20
    Michael Glover has written art criticism for The Times, The =
Economist, The Independent, and The Financial Times, among others. He is =
the author of several books and chapbooks of poetry, including Amidst =
All This Debris (2001) and The Bead-Eyed Man (2000), both from Dagger =
Press, and Impossible Horizons (Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995). Of his new =
book, For the Sheer Hell of Living, to be published this year by San =
Marco Press, John Ashbery writes, "Michael Glover's lines unspool =
gravely and efficiently with few commas like waves that know they are on =
the way to someplace but without making much fuss about it. They can be =
piercingly sad and hilariously wry, sometimes at the same time, as: =
'Someone loses the midge swat./ Many glasses are raised.'-this from a =
poem called 'Few things happen.' Few things happen here, true, but those =
that do are tremendously important even when tiny."
  Ernesto Priego is a Mexican poet, essayist, and translator presently =
living in London. He is the author of Not Even Dogs (Meritage Press, =
2006) as well as the blogs "Never Neutral" =
(http://neverneutral.wordpress.com/) and "The Jainak=FA Project" =
(http://thejainakuproject.blogspot.com/). A recent interview with him =
can be found on Tom Beckett's blog "E

  Readings begin at 6:30 PM (except for Saturday, 3 March, which begins =
at 6 PM) and are free to the public. Parasol Unit is located at 14 Wharf =
Road, London N1, near the Old Street and Angel tube stations.

yes, exactly--thanks for all this-- you can see the ram in the thicket at
the Archaeology Museum at UPenn--they even used to have key rings of it--and
at the British Museum & the Sumerian & Biblical refs are related, I remember
from a course on Mesopotamian & Sumerian myth & religion

you can also hold the oldest writing in the world (except accounting) at the

Subject:      The Fib at Saline (Salt Publishing) About Angel Exhaust 19
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Here's a note I just sent to Chris Emery of Salt regarding a posting by
"Jen" about Angel Exhaust 19.

Hey Chris--

The posting on Angel Exhaust is wrong.  The ending, on page 142 of issue
19 goes like this:

Methan:  Why is it called Devastate your Aunt Jeremy?
Manly:  It was a misundertanding between the two editors.
Methan: Are you going to explain the poetic landscape, and your spectrum
allotment, as a way of telling the reader what to expect?
Manly: They probably wouldn't know what to expect even if we disclosed
all that.
Methan: So what's the poetry like?
Manly: It is full of wonderfully sibilant s and amazingly lateral l
sounds.  Let me expand on that if you will.  Corcoran is like Corcoran.
Glass is like Glass.  Holman is like Holman.  Holman is more like Holman
than like Morris.
Methan:  I've never heard of them.
Manly: Maybe you should read Angel Exhaust.

Not a word in Duncan's back page note about Mssrs. Philpot or Nolan.

Jen's telling a fib that you should correct to set the record straight.

Jesse Glass

Take a look at "Jen's" posting at Saline and you'll see what a little
creative fibbing can accomplish.

There's the link, but here's the ending of Duncan's notice as "Jen"
tells it:

Methan: Why is it called Devastate your Aunt Jeremy?
Manly:  It was a misunderstanding between the two editors.

[The next two lines don't appear in Duncan's original, but are entirely
"Jen's" invention!]

Methan: Could we just describe the individual poets?
Manly: Poets like Philpott and Nolan are too overwhelming and intricate
to be described in a few words.

Methan:  I've never heard of them.
Manly: Maybe you should read Angel Exhaust.

Why would "Jen" fib like this?

Subject:      EDWARD HIRSCH at the Creative Writing Workshop, Brazil
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Dear Friends: I want to announce a new
workshop/retreat in Brazil. More information at
http://www.creativewritingbrazil.org


EDWARD HIRSCH will be teaching at the creative writing
workshop in Brazil from July 9-16, 2007.
Participate in a week-long poetry workshop with Edward
Hirsch and a translation class on Brazilian poets
Carlos Drummond de Andrade and Joao Cabral de Melo
Neto. Discussions on Elizabeth Bishop in Brazil and
tours of important cultural sites and literary
landmarks. Also, casual get togethers with leading
contemporary Brazilian poets, editors, writers,
translators, and publishers.

Creative Writing Brazil is an unique literary workshop
in Sao Paulo, Brazil organized by Rattapallax magazine
and Academia Interncional de Cinema. The workshops are
run by leading American and Brazilian poets, writers
and educators and conducted in English. The purpose of
the workshop is to experience the culture of Brazil
and produce new and complex literary work. Poets and
writers who have participated in our trips to Brazil
include Pulitzer Prize winning poet Yusef Komunyakaa,
Breytan Breytanbach, Jerome Rothenberg, Cecilia
Vicuna, Edwin Torres, Nathalie Handal, and Poetry
Wales editor Robert Minhinnick.

------
Edward Hirsch is a poet and critic. He has published
six books of poems: For the Sleepwalkers (1981), Wild
Gratitude (1986), which won the National Book Critics
Circle Award, The Night Parade (1989), Earthly
Measures (1994), On Love (1998), and Lay Back the
Darkness (2003). He has also written four prose books:
How to Read a Poem and Fall in Love with Poetry
(1999), a national bestseller, Responsive Reading
(1999), The Demon and the Angel: Searching for the
Source of Artistic Inspiration (2002), and Poet's
Choice (2006). He is the editor of Transforming
Vision: Writers on Art (1994) and Theodore Roethke's
Selected Poems (2005). He is also the co-editor of A
William Maxwell Portrait: Memories and Appreciations
(2004). He has received the Prix de Rome, a Guggenheim
Fellowship, the American Academy of Arts and Letters
Award for Literature, and a MacArthur Fellowship. He
taught for eighteen years at the University of
Houston, and is now the fourth president of the John
Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.
-----

Elizabeth Bishop in Brazil

Elizabeth Bishop lived in Brazil more or less
continuously from 1951 to 1966 and then intermittently
to 1971. The country functioned as a necessary escape
from the deprived and anxious world of her early
childhood. Creative Writing Brazil will have a
discussion about Bishop's life and work in Brazil. We
can also assist you with your travel plans to visit
Elizabeth Bishop's house in Ouro Preto and other noted
Bishop landmarks in Brazil. Also, introduce you to
renowned Bishop scholars and translators of her work.
-----

Tour of Sao Paulo & Salon Reading

Throughout the week, everyone will be having casual
get togethers with leading Brazilian poets, editors,
writers, and publishers. An important aspect of the
workshop is an interaction between participants and
their contemporary counterparts in Brazil. You will
visit important cultural sites, bookstores, and
literary landmarks. All participants will have an
opportunity to read at the Salons in Sao Paulo and New
York City. Also, Rattapallax magazine will assist with
the publication of the work produced during the
workshops in literary and online journals.
-----

Festa Literaria Internacional de Parati (FLIP)

FLIP is a leading and truly international literary
jamborees, known for the outstanding quality of its
guest authors, for the overwhelming enthusiasm of its
audiences, and for the town's relaxed hospitality.
FLIP has continued to attract some of the world's
finest authors including Toni Morrison, Don DeLillo,
Salman Rushdie, Martin Amis, Margaret Atwood, Paul
Auster, Michael Ondaatje, alongside living Brazilian
legends such as Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso. The
festival is held in Parati is a colonial sea-side town
nestled between the turquoise waters of Ilha Grande
Bay and vast swathes of unspoilt Atlantic rainforest.
Only a few hours from Sao Paulo.

Attend the Creative Writing Workshop and FLIP! We plan
to organize a trip to FLIP and will help you with your
travel plans to the festival. Must register early
because the festival sells out.

Subject:      Take 2 seconds to SAVE THE NEW GLOBE!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Dear Friend,

The New Globe Theater needs your help. If we do not
act now, we will forever lose the opportunity to
create an inspiring cultural icon in New York Harbor!

On Governors Island sits a dilapidated military
fortification ... and it happens to have the identical
blueprint as Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. We want to
restore the fort and re-imagine the open courtyard as
a vibrant performing arts center, however the National
Park Service is about to disallow this proposal.

The National Park Service stresses that the monument
belongs to the American people - so let us make sure
that they can't ignore what we want! click here:
http://www.newglobe.org/campaign/

In the spirit of placing the Statue of Liberty onto
the 1811 Fort Wood, let us transform this military
fort into a cultural beacon.

The New Globe proposal has received the backing of
hundreds of individuals and organizations, from
Senators Clinton and Schumer to Congressman Nadler and
Community Board #1, from actors (such as Al Pacino,
Kevin Kline, Mark Rylance, Ralph Fiennes, Estelle
Parsons, Melvin Van Peebles, Sarah Jessica Parker, and
Philip Seymour Hoffman) to artistic directors (Sam
Mendes, Oskar Eustis, Kenny Leon, and Sir Peter Hall).
Not only has New York's preservation community
embraced the proposal (e.g., NYC Landmarks
Preservation Commission, and Municipal Art Society),
but also a diverse range of individuals from war
veterans to acting students to G.I. army brats. For
more information, see www.newglobe.org.

I ask you to join me and all of our supporters in
urging the National Park Service to be visionary and
imaginative! Your action today truly makes a
difference in our ongoing efforts to create a new
cultural destination in New York Harbor. I hope to see
you at opening night.

Sincerely,
Dr. Barbara Romer
Founder and CEO of the The New Globe Theater

Jennifer

I'm very displeased with much of the hostility this thread has generated.

I don't want to get into a contest over which groups get treated the worst,
but I'd say people with disabilities take a lot of hits that people in
general don't notice and aren't aware of.

Having Tourette Syndrome has caused me to endure discrimination in every
area you mention. I might hold the personal record for hearing "We filled
that opening yesterday" at a job interview.

Throughout history, people with Tourette have been burned alive after being
accused of demonic possession.That's a very terminal stigma, I'd say.

My symptoms aren't things I can hide. I can't "pass" for non-Tourettic.

I'm appalled at the people who think they can talk about my condition with
levity and impunity. Of course, when I verbally savage someone who started
treating me like a subhuman, I'm perceived as the villain because a crip
just ain't sposed ta beat a normie.

The interview Ric Carfagna did with me in the latest Big Bridge describes
some of my personal experiences. After reading it, some people have
expressed surprise at what I've had to go through.

And I did have a negative encounter with another "Mr. Sensitivity" on this
List about six months ago.

Don't get me started on the way blind people are patronized, as though
their being blind makes their ability to talk or think coherently a miracle.
My grandfather could do everything any other commercial fisherman could do,
as long as you pointed the boat in the right direction for him.

The article is only available to subscribers. If you are one, maybe you could cut and paste the text into an e-mail for us? (Not that I want to lure you into doing something illegal.) Anyway, there's been a lot of boo-hooing over the booming art market. Check out Jerry Saltz in the Village Voice: http://www.villagevoice.com/art/0704,saltz,75590,13.html

I'm confused, Jesse. How is Jen - a real person, deserving of not
being put in quotation marks - supposed to have "fibbed"? The email
from Andrew Duncan that Tony Frazer forwarded to UK Poets is exactly
the same as the post at Saline. Did Tony Frazer fib as well?

Vernon,
  I lived next door to a kid who had Tourette Syndrome. HIs name was Jim Eisenreich and he went on to play professional baseball. My understanding is that he became a spokesperson for people who have Tourette Syndrome. Are you familiar with him? I think that he was traded by the Twins to the Royals and then became a very successful and admired professional ball player, partly because he did talk about having Tourette Syndrome and how it affected him. I think the people of my hometown have a great deal of admiration and respect for him.

  Best,
  Mary Kasimor

I got to meet Jim Eisenreich once at a Twins game here in Milwaukee.
a very inspirational person and excellent outfielder and hitter--
he had to endure some very tough times his first years in the Big
leagues--can only imagine what was like in the Minors--
wrote abt him to this list some time ago

my all time favorite ball player is Rube Waddell--one of the all time
characters--he is in the Hall of Fame probably wd never be allowed past
Special Olympics these days--
he was mentally ill, developmentally challenged, what they used to call
"slow"--and an alcoholic to boot--
only Sandy Koufax had more stirkeouts by a lefthander in one season, over
fifty years after Rube set the record--
in early days of baseball deaf mutes were not uncommon--prompting the use of
signs for balls and strikes by umpires--
in baseball quite along list of players with various disabilities--Jimmy
Piersall--for example--in an asylum for a while during his major league
career (his book Fear Strikes Out made into film with Tony Perkins playing
Jimbo)--

Well, I drafted him on my fantasy team.
He went to the Phillies after KC.
In 15 seasons he had a .290 batting average. Pretty damned good.

Ah, I see what is going on. You need not pay AFAICT, but you must

don't have to hop their demographic hoops. The current bugmenot password
for the Jed Perl article is the strangely disturbing

Mary and David

I'm very familiar with Jim Eisenreich, from his promising start as a rookie
to his virtually getting booed out of the game for several years. I didn't
understand why anybody would boo a .300 hitter---but then, I was at least a
decade away from receiving my diagnosis. He was one of my favorite players
when he played with the Florida Marlins. I've never really spoken to him,
although I think we did serve together on a panel at a conference sponsored
by the National Tourette Syndrome Association.

I remember reading about Rube Waddell when I was a kid. As I recall, he went
for a ride on a fire truck on a day when he was supposed to pitch. According
to the records and the story books, though, he was an amazing pitcher. His
strikeout record stood for some time, as you point out, David.

I remember Fear Strikes Out and, as a lifelong Red Sox fan, always
appreciated Jimmy Piersall's playing. Although he wasn't a Hall of Famer,
he probably would have received a lot more recognition if he hadn't played
in the shadows of Willie, Mickey and the Duke.

Yeah, and before that, a TV play with Tab Hunter playing Jim.
I guess they saw some sense in having 2 actors who didnt know how to
throw a baseball do it.

Dear members:

Some people have diarrhea of the mouth. It is a medical condition, but =20
it doesn't mean we all have to pay attention to, well, the product of =20
said medical condition. That is what toilets are for. And delete =20
buttons, ok. There is always the "I WIN" button... available for when =20
your computer OR another human thinks it has the best of you.

Poetry discussions are so much better than crap-slinging. Isn't there =20
enough raw-ness in language and its composition, that we can avoid the =20
raw-sewage stuff? I know there are more critical discussions, =20
especially of ideas (which are lacking in other conversations these =20
days), in this listserv's future. Otherwise, why are any of us here.

Write on! Listen and read and hear and say and smell (if you =20
dare)...all that there is for you here online and everywhere... But =20
please stay home if you need to be near the crapper,   T. F. Rice


"We pretend the raw bloom remains
unshattered
by the ravishing dregs of lost humanity"
...just a little something i wrote when i was a teenager... he-hee... =20
we havent come very far since then as a human race...

"Purple Scapegoat"

Purple was blamed for what blue and red did,
discriminated against for the mere color of his skin.
It seems the Color Police aren't really all that discriminating,
in the truer sense of the word. Where would we be if we discriminated
nothing. Distinction and discernment are cords that make our unique =20
world. We have eyes that see and ears that hear.

It is those who have a desire to shoot someone who make a word "wrong" =20
or naughty", and then proceed to shoot at it with all they have. Or =20
maybe at times the desirous one is (s)he who says the word in a new =20
way. Whatever the case, be nice to purple. And red and blue. Because =20
whoever did the wrong will show himself in the end. They always do. =20
"Give them enough rope and they will hang themselves" has always rung =20
true in my life and misc strugglings.

To discriminate:

1. Show prejudice, favor, show bias, treat unfairly.
2. Distinguish, differentiate, separate, contrast, compare, tell the =20
difference, judge, draw a distinction, discern, segregate.

All in fun, since abstraction can be fun when wanting to say something real,
T.F. Rice

Subject:      New Book: Betsy Andrews' NEW JERSEY
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

Betsy Andrews' NEW JERSEY, winner of the 2007 Brittingham Prize, is now available from University of Wisconsin Press.

To order directly from the Press: http://www.wisc.edu/wisconsinpress/books/4306.htm

“The heart of darkness is alive and beating in Betsy Andrews’s New Jersey. With its commitment to naming, to witnessing the machinations and degradations of our terror,’ this is a brave poem, and a necessary one.”
—Anne Waldman, Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics

“New Jersey hotwired, New Jersey on speed: the Turnpike unrolls its scathing demotic across the humiliated landscape that was once a bright idea; the Turnpike dreams of minutemen and wakes to Abu Ghraib; the Turnpike names its toll plazas for poets and founding fathers and channels its weary to Burger Kings and ATMs. No help for us, the country’s in the breakdown lane. But Betsy Andrews writes its antic obit in a vein so charged with wit and razzle-dazzle that something must be salvageable even now. We must, in spite of ourselves, have done something right. New Jersey is a brilliant debut.”
     —Linda Gregerson, author of The Woman Who Died in Her Sleep

“Serving the swerve from witness to outrage, the poem follows war’s disastrous trajectory from domestic to international policy and singular to universal tragedy with unrelenting honesty. Andrews has a queer eye for empire, and this work is an incisive, exciting, and necessary intervention.”
—Brian Teare, author of The Room Where I Was Born
