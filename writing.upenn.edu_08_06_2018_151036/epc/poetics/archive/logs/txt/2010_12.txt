ALL TOGETHER NOW
A Digital Bridge for Auckland and Sydney, 2010

The New Zealand Electronic Poetry Centre (nzepc) is pleased to
announce the completion of its trans Tasman digital bridge project.

We invited contributions to build a digital bridge between Auckland
and Sydney as poetry symposiums took place in each city in March and
September 2010. In June the first part of the bridge was launched:
50-plus creative contributions, a collaborative digital poem, audio
talks and photos from the Auckland symposium. Now the Sydney side
launches with 60 creative contributions, a complementary digital
collaboration, more audio talks, video readings, photos, and texts of
papers and commentary. We present here the multiple traces (text,
audio, visuals, poetry, prose) of the year=92s trans Tasman exchanges,
noting how often the roles of host and guest have flip-flopped, and
hoping that they will go on doing so as we move between each other=92s
reading and writing spaces.

That was a reasonably common practice among New York School poets.

_Wallet_, published by letterpress (Bloody Twin Books) in the 1990s, opens with a 14-line poem, each line of which is the first line of the subsequent 14 14-line poems. Each line became a site of meditation. I think I realized what I was doing before I was done with the first poem, I can't remember, but the idea arose after remembering having read the table of contents of a Dorn book years before mistakenly as a poem (and I hadn't figured it out until a few intended poems in). _Wallet_, a small book in many ways (15 poems, small physical dimensions), took a year-and-a-half to write. The letter press printing by Brian Richards has largely kept it out of the used book trade. (I.e., impossible to find a copy to buy. . . . and I'm always looking. If anyone wants to sell one, please write: skip@louisiana.edu)

hi,

a reader recently told me that my table of contents/concepts page was almost
a poem all by itself. you ever feel that way?

wait, has anyone ever written a book of poetry where the table of contents
actually *was* a poem, and then each line of that poem was a title of a poem
*in* the book???

(Apologies for any double postings)

Dear friends and colleagues,

My composer/collaborator, Ellen Fishman Johnson, has just posted a few
short excerpts on YouTube from This Art Burning, our multi-media
performances of music, text and video presented at this year's Philly
Fringe Festival in September.The Philadelphia Inquirer reviewer wrote of
*This Art Burning: *"And, perhaps, Ellen Fishman-Johnson, one of
Philadelphia's lower-key composers, nevertheless left quite a mark on
the Fringe <http://topics.philly.com/topic/Fringe> Festival Saturday at
the Performance Garage with 90 polished minutes of music/video pieces
created in collaboration with poet Michael Heller. All possible
combinations of words and music were explored."For those of you who saw
the performances and those who may have missed it, the excerpts can be
viewed at:

I have also been fascinated by the imaginal replacement of apparatus and text.

When I began working at a more visible level, it was still special to
be able to transfer a scholarly index into electronic form without
merely transcribing, but instead transforming it.

NIGHT SHADES: A Fable for Klara K

by Chris Tysh

Cover by Christian Boltanski

Design by Hazel Blake

80 pages     $14      ISBN 0-935992-40-5

"In Tysh's tough, visceral, lacerating text, we bear witness to a
surreal poetry for the stage, reminiscent of Buchner, Artaud, Genet,
and Heiner Muller. Klara K leads us on an unspeakable journey through
the ravages of WWII, while bearing a child who will never know these
immensely moving shards of stories except through her mother's
anguished memories. NIGHT SCALES is a compassionate, devastating tale
of death and survival by those who "...ate the bruises and drank the
hurt in a long swallow," and those who still "hoard the pain, like a
gift that flowers on a dry stalk."  Charles Borkhuis

"Why turn memory into theater? With NIGHT SCALES: A FABLE FOR KLARA K,
Chris Tysh threads devastating testimony and playful humor through the
question of how we enact, with bodies, as performance, memory's
language. Does memory become gesture, dialogue, set design? Is it
spoken alone or in the whole community? Using theater as an
overarching challenge, how does memory become both song and costume,
narrator and chorus, horrors and stage business equally? Developing
voices we recognize and grow attached to, NIGHT SCALES moves us
through events of the Holocaust seen in the hot and the cold, in
mundane songs and fragments of Russian, French and English. But how do
we see horrors in language without staging them in real terms, even in
our minds? The very best theater works both as play script and as
mental mise-en-scene, concretizing the nominal world into bodies,
actors, breathing. This is Tysh's fundamental 'rouge limit' as she
writes it, on the road which is the melancholy passage of history,
where personal stories become an affecting and unforgettable public
display." Thalia Field

REMINDER


CALL FOR PROPOSALS

The editor of a book collection tentatively called The Wild That =
Attracts Us: New Critical Essays on Robinson Jeffers invites proposals =
for essays that evidence the advance in Jeffers scholarship, especially =
since the publication of the most recent collections in the early- and =
mid-1990s.  Since the publication of those volumes, The Robinson Jeffers =
Association has prompted a great deal of new work on Jeffers, most =
especially through their annual academic conferences.  Likewise, the =
founding of Jeffers Studies has proved to be a real stimulus for Jeffers =
scholarship.  Given the enlivened atmosphere of Jeffers scholarship, the =
time is right for a new collection of essays, one that significantly =
adds to the body of critical work on Robinson Jeffers.

=20

To that end, proposals are invited for essays that specifically address =
the critical sea-change of the past two decades, especially as it =
concerns Jeffers study, including but not limited to: the full advance =
of ecocriticism; the re-imagining of regionalism as place studies; the =
continuing development of cultural studies and the new historicism; the =
development of the New Formalism; the increasingly poignant vector of =
science and literature; the advances in narratology; the glaring =
omission of feminist analysis in Jeffers scholarship; the similar dearth =
of writing about the teaching of Jeffers.  The primary audience for this =
project will be academic, faculty and students primarily at the =
undergraduate and graduate level; secondary audiences would include the =
general public, especially given that Jeffers has long maintained an =
energetic and mindful readership.

=20

Proposals should be 750-1,000 words, include a clear title, highlight a =
unique contribution to Jeffers scholarship, and provide the editor with =
an unambiguous argument as to Jeffers=92 poetry, the critical tactics =
undertaken by the essay=92s author, and the significance of the essay to =
Jeffers scholarship as a whole.  The deadline for proposals is December =
31, 2010.  Proposals may be sent either electronically or in hard copy =
to the appropriate address below.

 *Fall Reading Series*
*Reading by Alissa Nutting*
*Sunday, December 5, 2:00pm*
*Swift Hall, Room 106*

Join us, Sunday, December 5th at 2pm for the third installment of The
Renaissance Society's Fall Reading Series, a reading by Alissa Nutting.  The
reading will take place in Swift Hall in room 106 and will be followed by a
reception at The Renaissance Society <http://www.renaissancesociety.org/> (Cobb
Hall, 4th Floor) that will include book signing and refreshments.

*This event is FREE and open to the public. *

Nutting's writing has appeared in *Tin House*, *Fence*, *BOMB*, and the
fairy tale anthology* My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me*. Her
short story collection, *Unclean Jobs for Women and Girls*, was selected by
Ben Marcus as winner of the 6th Starcherone Prize.

"Alissa Nutting's stunning debut collection, *Unclean Jobs for Women and
Girls*, reanimates the deadest of dead pans to a state of enameled kabuki
solar veneer - a sanctified, sublime, full-throated and full-throttled
static panic. These fictions are panoplies of syntactic semantic seismic
wonders. Don't look now but you are looking at a sun raised to a higher
power, and it's not blinking." Michael Martone

=93Can you pour new wine into old bottles? Well, if you are Camille Martin =
and the bottles are sonnets,
the answer is an emphatic, 'Yes'" . . .

Subject:      Gay author banned from discussing his opposition to repealing DADT
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252

Gay author banned from discussing his opposition to repealing DADT.

On Thursday, December 2nd, 2010, CAConrad, author of Deviant
Propulsion (Soft Skull Press), The Book of Frank (WAVE Books), and
other books, was forbidden to speak on NPR's show Radio Times, hosted
by Marty Moss-Coane.

The show's focus was repealing DADT, with guests Tammy Schultz of the
US Marine Corps War College, and Tobias Barrington Wolff, a professor
of constitutional law at UPenn.  The phone lines were open to the
public, but when CAConrad spoke with call-screeners his opening remark
was, "I am a gay man who is against repealing DADT and I have an
online petition called Gays Against Gays in the Military."  The
screener's abrupt response was, "You're off topic," and hung up.  Off
topic?  Calling back a second time CAConrad very quickly said, "This
is not off-topic.  And I am opposed to war, which is why I'm opposed
to repealing DADT.  Three children died every single day of
war-related injuries in Afghanistan in 2009, and THAT is not a civil
right, killing three children a day."  He was abruptly told, "This is
not about war and I don't have time to discuss this."  Not about war?
One of the guests is from the US Marine Corps War College.  And since
when is the US military not about war?  Especially in 2010?

Here is a link to the show:
http://whyy.org/cms/radiotimes/2010/12/02/the-effects-of-repealing-don=92t-=
ask-don=92t-tell-according-to-the-pentagon/

Listening to the show it is clear that the guests were in favor of
repealing DADT, but not once did anyone mention the illegal wars the
US is engaged in at present.  When it came time to allow callers onto
the show there were openly gay people who fell in line with the guests
and their agenda.

CAConrad's online petition GAYS AGAINST GAYS IN THE MILITARY can be
seen at this link:  http://invasionanniversary.blogspot.com

He is available for discussing the petition, the wars, and the
military.  If you are interested in interviewing him on or off air,
please contact him directly at CAConrad13@aol.com, or phone him
directly at 215.563.3075

His books and other writings can be found at his web page

Press and author bios

**Argos Books
http://www.argosbooks.org/

Argos Books was born one auspicious night in Brooklyn in a little =20
place called Daddy=92s. Amidst the din of spinning LPs, under the =20
flatteringly dim lighting, over two beautiful amber pints of Stella, =20
Liz Clark Wessel and I spoke of our mutual passion for small press =20
poetry publishing. Having known (and grown to love) Liz for a few =20
months, I was aware that she had started a small press called Stray =20
Dog Press in Stockholm; I harbored much curiosity about the state of =20
its existence. Liz told me about the process of publishing her first =20
book, S.C. Hahn=92s A Sky That is Never the Same, and within moments =20
sparks of enthusiasm were flying, invisibly lighting the cave-like =20
corner in which we sat.

Our decision that eve to rename and revive Stray Dog was cemented =20
further when another brilliant and capable cohort, E.C. Belli  joined =20=

forces with Liz and me. We three wise ladies all attend Columbia =20
University=92s Poetry M.F.A. program, and I am grateful to the Fates for =
=20
bringing us together in such a poetically fertile environment. Argos =20
was the name of Odysseus=92 faithful canine companion; Argos Books will =20=

soon be a faithful companion to readers and lovers of poetry and =20
translation. Poetry that crosses cultural and national borders, hybrid =20=

writing, and work by women is of special interest. Interestingly =20
enough, the mission of Argos Books mirrors somewhat the pursuits of =20
Liz, Emily and myself. We are all translators, and have firm footholds =20=

in diverse locations (Omaha, Switzerland, New York, Stockholm=85). The =20=

upcoming summer and fall promise to be exciting and fruitful times for =20=

Argos Books. Stay tuned.

Greetings=2C
=20
I am looking for poems that exhibit=2C or are examples of=2C "code meshing"=
 in literature=2C specifically poetry. (Due to access issues=2C though I sh=
ouldn't underestimate our library=2C online sources would be especially hel=
pful.) We are considering the term "code meshing" in the sense that it is u=
sed (but in another context) by S. Michael-Luna & A. Suresh Canagarajah=2C =
and others:
=20
=20
=20
"Code meshing is a communicative device used for specific rhetorical and id=
eological purposes in which a multilingual speaker intentionally integrates=
 local and academic discourse as a form of resistance=2C reappropriation an=
d/or transformation of the academic discourse."
=20
"Code meshing differs from a more familiar sociolinguistic notion=2C code s=
witching."
=20
"Code meshing is a social practice which intentionally integrates local and=
 academic discourse in order to index specific discursive=2Cideological and=
 rhetorical stances of the interlocutor. Code meshing both accommodates the=
 merging of discourses that other scholars have previously discussed=2C and=
 advances the consideration of lexical=2C rhetorical and structural hybridi=
ty previously unexamined."
=20
"Code meshing suggests that the context is an integral part of the observab=
le interaction and cannot be separated from it."
=20
"Code meshing recognises an integration of multiple codes of language by su=
ggesting that knowledge and linguistic resources are not only integrated or=
 meshed but also include hybrid codes. Code switching=2C on the other hand=
=2C involves items at the lexical or syntactic level and has focused on bal=
anced bilingual language use. Code meshing can also involve single lexical =
items=2C but additionally uses broad rhetorical strategies=2C structural un=
its and considers the full continuum of bilingualism."
=20
"We must distinguish code meshing from code mixing which refers to the incl=
usion of single lexical items (=91borrowings=92) that have become naturalis=
ed in the borrowing language. Code meshing also includes mixtures of larger=
 structural and rhetorical units=2C and symbolises something intentionally =
=91marked=92 in the dominant language of the text."

"Code switching models of writing propose that bilinguals learn different E=
nglish varieties and use them in appropriate contexts. Code meshing suggest=
s that students should learn to bring together different codes to serve the=
ir purpose. Code meshing suggests that students should have opportunities t=
o re-appropriate the knowledge and linguistic structure of dominant academi=
c discourses into their already rich polylinguistic repertoire. Lexical and=
 grammatical choices can demonstrate a student=92s way to convey meaning=2C=
 index values and norms outside the discourse=2Cor make ideologically-inscr=
ibed statements."

Due to access issues=2C though I shouldn't underestimate our library=2C onl=
ine literary sources representing the above ideas would be especially helpf=
ul.

i'm not sure i'm grasping this, but it seems that Cornel West's public
presentations and conference lectures fit the bill.

(Due to access issues, though I shouldn't underestimate our library, online sources would be especially helpful.) We are considering the term "code meshing" in the sense that it is used (but in another context) by S. Michael-Luna & A. Suresh Canagarajah, and others:

>
> "Code meshing is a social practice which intentionally integrates local and academic discourse in order to index specific discursive,ideological and rhetorical stances of the interlocutor. Code meshing both accommodates the merging of discourses that other scholars have previously discussed, and advances the consideration of lexical, rhetorical and structural hybridity previously unexamined."
>
> "Code meshing suggests that the context is an integral part of the observable interaction and cannot be separated from it."
>
> "Code meshing recognises an integration of multiple codes of language by suggesting that knowledge and linguistic resources are not only integrated or meshed but also include hybrid codes. Code switching, on the other hand, involves items at the lexical or syntactic level and has focused on balanced bilingual language use. Code meshing can also involve single lexical items, but additionally uses broad rhetorical strategies, structural units and considers the full continuum of bilingualism."
>
> "We must distinguish code meshing from code mixing which refers to the inclusion of single lexical items (‘borrowings’) that have become naturalised in the borrowing language. Code meshing also includes mixtures of larger structural and rhetorical units, and symbolises something intentionally ‘marked’ in the dominant language of the text."
>
> "Code switching models of writing propose that bilinguals learn different English varieties and use them in appropriate contexts. Code meshing suggests that students should learn to bring together different codes to serve their purpose. Code meshing suggests that students should have opportunities to re-appropriate the knowledge and linguistic structure of dominant academic discourses into their already rich polylinguistic repertoire. Lexical and grammatical choices can demonstrate a student’s way to convey meaning, index values and norms outside the discourse,or make ideologically-inscribed statements."

and most of it has crashed here in this small pamphlet by Mr K**** and Mr
W*****. I didn't enjoy myself, hated the whole thing, wanted to look away;
but then again there is no one else to look to, it fills one's vision so.
This is real Agent Orange in an imaginary garden. Have it."

brad brace will present a performative lecture that explores
blood, ultimately asking but is blood art? while bringing
her alter ego to life through narrative and fantasy while
presenting a small-scale, close-up video installation
presenting a performance which needs you to take control,
you are the judge and you are the performer while creating a
semi-prIvate installation involving two artists, two chairs,
a table and chewing gum while presenting an old man and old
woman frantically preparing chairs for a series of invisible
guests while anticipating that future reports may state that
he attempted to build a spaceship using found materials to
help the stranded Horsehead Nebula back to his rightful home
while presenting a tale of repressed sexual desire, a
never-before- told story of fantasy and pleasure while
reflecting the importance of exploring chance systematically
while undertaking a conversation that that alludes to an
experience concerned with some form of transcendental truth
while reacting 'live' to a selection of pre-selected footage
that is appearing beside him on a screen while forming a
resistance movement, raising heads, hands and hearts in
protest while testing her mental and physical strength by
adopting the stress position for an extended period of time
while exploring rituals that may offer a way to reconnect
with our relationship to the non-human world while
undertaking an investigation of minimal movement that is
pure but also has the capacity to reflect true emotion while
presenting an abstract exploration of the medieval witch
trials while presenting the Mr Punch and his wife Judy
reciting poetry, discussing politics, watching TV and
getting horribly disemboweled by crocodiles...

_______________


CONDITION OF FIRE, by the Edinburgh poet JL Williams, inspired by
Ovid=92s Metamorphoses and written on the explosive Aeolian Isles, will
be published by Shearsman Books of Exeter, England on January 15th of
2011.

http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2011/williams.html

http://jlwilliamspoetry.co.uk/

Ovid wrote his famous stories of change just before he was banished
from his beloved Rome and after travelling and observing many diverse
and vibrant landscapes.  He may well have visited and was
knowledgeable of the Aeolian Isles where volcanoes cast molten lava
into turquoise seas, whipped by the winds of the god who made his home
there.  It was to these rapturous, Edenic and violently creative
islands that JL Williams ventured to write the poems in this
collection; poems inspired both directly by Ovid's tales and informing
the new story that emerges from the old ... a post-apocalyptic vision
of the earth where metamorphoses engender rebirth out of the ashen
wasteland that humankind has made of the world.  Ovid expressed the
truth that to change is to survive, and this message erupts out of the
poems in CONDITION OF FIRE, whose language and images strive to
communicate in new ways the essential elements of myth, creation and
the burning breath of being.

 i I think I heard of Minnetonka Review through Poets and Writers. I receiv=
ed the first copy I was in and was pleased to find I enjoyed my fellow poet=
s in that issue. The next one I received had such a atriking cover I placed=
 it face out. Just got the news that they had nominated me for a Pushcart a=

cedure. So thanks to them and check out the mag. Happy holidays to you guys=

These sound like great=C2=A0 projects. Like turning up the soil, shining li=
ght on the roots and either enriching the shape of the bush or maybe creati=
ng a whole way of looking at the "collected/selected" scenario for each of =
these poets. Cannon/Canon curing and/or re-shaking/birthing the whole plant=
. (to mix up a few metaphors!).=20

It seems to come with the whole new questioning of archives and how poetry =
editors, let alone current scholars,=C2=A0 may or may not explore and give =
value to materials previously considered taboo or of 'marginal' and/or dism=
issive consequence. Not just to the poet, but to the study of=C2=A0 all the=
 other dynamics (gender/racial and otherwise) that impact the work of a per=
iod. The 50's and 60's letters and journals, for example,=C2=A0 of women po=
ets (many of them only published minimally in the form of books)) may total=
ly crash into now institutionalized myths of male poets of the period (the =
women who, however, often figure as lovers and whose private writings smash=
 into what ever feminine mystique that parades about in the dominant poetry=
 of the time and now 'memory'. Not to now acknowledge the good public accou=
nts of Hettie Jones and Diane DiPrima).=20

Course it can be much 'literary' too. I am glad to see the emergence of Spi=
cer's attempt to to translate Beowulf. I remember reading that little noteb=
ook in the Bancroft archive and having some instinctive sense that metric a=
lso informed Spicer's, albeit often counter-heroic exploits the language.=

Amiri Baraka, the noted poet, playwright and co-founder of the Black
Arts Movement of the 1960=B9s, will headline two special events on
campus. At 4 p.m., the widely published author plans to present
a Master Class for RIT students and others interested in writing poetry,
fiction or creative nonfiction.

Following, at 7:30 p.m., his award-winning play,Dutchman, will be performed
by the theater troupe Many Voices, co-produced with Maplewood Performing
Arts Center. Both events are free and open to the public.

The Dutchman debuted in 1964, and received the Obie Award for
outstanding Off-Broadway play. It was made into a feature film in
1966, and has been sighted as the first major work of the Black Arts
Movement, and remains a classic commentary on race, class and gender
in the United States. For more than a half-century, Baraka=B9s dramas,
poetry and jazz criticism have earned him international acclaim and
numerous awards including the 1984 American Book Award, the
PEN-Faulkner Award, the Langston Hughes Medal and the National
Endowment for the Arts Poetry Award.

The performance is sponsored by Poets and Writers Inc, with public
funds from the New York State Council on the Arts. Additional funds
are provided by RIT=B9s Department of English, Department of Fine Arts,
Office of Special Projects and Office of Student Affairs and NTID=B9s
Department of Performing Arts, and private donors through Many Voices
Productions.

Subject:      Digital Creeley Maps at Stanford
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"

Hi and happy December!

Wondering if any of you have seen the beautiful Creeley visualizations,
created by the Digital Humanities people at Stanford? I don't know much
about the maps other than they are based on Creeley's electronic
correspondence, which (I believe) he donated to Stanford.  The links belo=
w
connect to Creeley "correspondence," or "network" graphs, using the 50,00=
0+
emails he sent to various people between 1995-2005. I think these are
incredible, and poetic, yet the colored lines are not representative of t=
he
language he used in regular e-speak, more so the structure of the languag=
e
he used. Interestingly, all the maps look similar, which makes for all ki=
nds
of potentially interesting structural and post-structural interpretations=

vis a vis vispo, and other po, should someone be so inclined to make them=
.

Thought I'd share these glorious things...

Happy everything, all.=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20

Lost and Found really is a great project, and I'd urge everyone to =
subscribe to the series -- the price is really friendly, -- you get, um, =
 a lot of=20
Bang for your Bucks -- and the material is, as Stephen suggests, really =
innovative, important lost material rediscovered. Well-edited, sensible =
commentary, the annotation is pertinent but not overwhelming. A terrific =
and useful series. Get all issues if you can, yes. Any sensible library =
should subscribe.

These sound like great projects. Like turning up the soil, shining light =
on the roots and either enriching the shape of the bush or maybe =
creating a whole way of looking at the "collected/selected" scenario for =
each of these poets. Cannon/Canon curing and/or re-shaking/birthing the =
whole plant. (to mix up a few metaphors!).=20

It seems to come with the whole new questioning of archives and how =
poetry editors, let alone current scholars, may or may not explore and =
give value to materials previously considered taboo or of 'marginal' =
and/or dismissive consequence. Not just to the poet, but to the study of =
all the other dynamics (gender/racial and otherwise) that impact the =
work of a period. The 50's and 60's letters and journals, for example, =
of women poets (many of them only published minimally in the form of =
books)) may totally crash into now institutionalized myths of male poets =
of the period (the women who, however, often figure as lovers and whose =
private writings smash into what ever feminine mystique that parades =
about in the dominant poetry of the time and now 'memory'. Not to now =
acknowledge the good public accounts of Hettie Jones and Diane DiPrima). =


Course it can be much 'literary' too. I am glad to see the emergence of =
Spicer's attempt to to translate Beowulf. I remember reading that little =
notebook in the Bancroft archive and having some instinctive sense that =
metric also informed Spicer's, albeit often counter-heroic exploits the =
language.=20

An announcement of Series II of Lost & Found! And consider

For Release=20

Pub Date: March 3, 2011=20

Lost & Found: The CUNY Poetics Documents Initiative

Series II

Following the widespread success of the chapbooks Series I of Lost
& Found: The CUNY Poetics Documents Initiative, the Center for the
Humanities and the Ph.D. Program in English at The Graduate Center, =
CUNY, are
pleased to announce another exciting series of texts in chapbook
formcorrespondence, journal entries, transcripts of lectures and =
unpublished
manuscriptsby poets of the postwar era.=20

Lost & Found emerged from archival and textual scholarship done by
students, faculty and guest fellows at the Graduate Center. Printed in =
elegant,
stapled editions, the first series of chapbooks put into wider =
circulation
important but little-known texts drawn from personal and institutional =
archives
of writers such as Amiri Baraka, Edward Dorn, Kenneth Koch, Frank OHara,
Philip Whalen, Robert Creeley, Daphne Marlatt, and Muriel Rukeyser, =
whose
unpublished essay on Charles Darwin (rejected by the Nation in 1953) was
discovered in the New York Public Librarys Berg Collection by a Graduate
Center doctoral student. This is the type of intervention that prompted =
the London
Review of Books to call Lost & Found A serious and worthy
enterprise. universities should sponsor works like these, and graduate
students should edit them, and people who care about these poets should =
read
them."

Series II of Lost & Found is equally exciting, featuring the following
chapbooks:=20

Selections from El Corno Emplumado / The Plumed Horn, ed. Margaret
Randall

Diane di Prima: The Mysteries of Vision: Some Notes on H.D., ed. Ana
Boicevic

Diane di Prima: R.D.s HD, ed. Ammiel Alcalay

David Henderson: Umbra Extensions, ed. Tonya Foster

Muriel Rukeyser: Spanish Civil War Scrapbook, ed. Rowena Kennedy-Epstein

Jack Spicers Translation of Beowulf: Selections, eds. David
Hadbawnik and Sean Reynolds

Robert Duncan: Olson Memorial Lecture #4, eds. Meira Levinson, Bradley
Lubin, Megan Paslawski, Kyle Waugh, Rachael Wilson, and Ammiel Alcalay

Series II of Lost & Found will publish concurrently with the
Third Annual Chapbook Festival at The Graduate Center on March 3-4, =
2011. A
series of public conversations and a window display will be organized to =
launch
the series.=20
General Editor Ammiel Alcalay and Center for Humanities Executive =
Director
Aoibheann Sweeney are available for interview on this groundbreaking =
project.=20
Copies of Series I are available for institutional and bookstore sale at =
a
discounted rate. Individual chapbooks retail at $10.00, or $35.00/set.
Membership subscriptions with additional benefits are also available.=20

Subject: Joel Chace's Latest Chap Book --Blake's Tree-- Just Published by
Blue & Yellow Dog Press!!

 Hi everyone



Joel Chace has a new chap book just out from Blue&Yellow Dog Press.



For those of you who surf the web seeking outstanding poetry experience

you are familiar most probably with the work of Joel Chace and know how
perceptive he is.

In his latest chap book--Blake's Tree--he is no less avant garde.

The poems kindle up an amazing take on a world cut to bits and reassembled.



For those of you who aren't familiar with him and his poetry

his latest chap book--Blake's Tree--is a great introduction
to some dazzling foot work achieved line by line.



Here are some details about Blake's Tree:



"Blake=92s Tree begs to be read out loud.  Uncanny and spot-on, the repetit=
ion
of words and phrases which levitate within a controlled form.  Lushness in
the economy of word.   Lyric and narrative commingle.  This is serious and
necessary fun."



--Kit Kennedy

William Blake played on his own name in =93The Little Black Boy=94 (Blake =
=3D
Black) and whirled us between nouns and verbs when he wrote, =93Damn braces=
,
Bless relaxes.=94 In these six-line, stanzaic pieces, Joel Chace follows
Blake=92s example=97not only his =93tree=94 but his =94poetree=94=97and off=
ers enigmatic
phrases that tease us out of thought. For a moment we are freed from cause
and effect, from everything that insists on logic, and allowed to enter a
space in which everything happens at once. =93Negative capability=94 flouri=
shes
in this world of beautiful whatevers=97where =93over the riven and through=
=94 is
not a typo and =93light snapped on off whole city=92s ponderable spook=94 i=
s a
perfectly reasonable, complete thing to say. =93The world is all that is th=
e
case,=94 Wittgenstein wrote memorably. But he also wrote, =93Thought can be=
 of
what is not the case.=94 These poems offer a beautiful release from our
everyday sorrows, joys and dispositions. Climb Blake=92s tree and see
exquisite explorations of =93what is not the case.=94

Please backchannel me if you can point me in the direction of poems
that employ a long line (for a new project).

milkmag@rcn.com

Many thanks if you can suggest long-line works by poets other than
Smart, Ginsberg, Whitman or other obvious.
Interested in translated Nordic poetries, Native American, African
poetries, Arabic forms with long line. Thank you.

A poetry text book based on David Jaffin's work as read and interpreted
by a group of highly intelligent poetry lovers in Fort Myers, Florida.
As the back copy says:

"One day at the beach, David [Jaffin], a modern poet who gives readings,
innocently walks in front of a firing squad:

Silvia is a musician who expects to hear melody.
Rudigar is a scientist who wants to understand why.
Laura is an adventurer listening for a personal story.
Warren is a grammarian insistent on linguistic purity.
Carol is a German teacher with a passion for puzzles.
Dudley is a mechanic in search of transcendent truth.
Chang, a programmer, sees poems as logical processes.

***..."

[Lists seven more characters, but you get the drift.]

This book not only includes worksheets, study guides, and an on-line
website to help the initiated enlighten the uninitiated, it's actually
a good read in terms of story--warm and funny--and well written in the
bargain.  David Jaffin doesn't escape unscathed from the questioning
and explaining, and sometimes resembles the proverbial lamb thrown to
the lions, but in the end he's allowed to maintain his special status
as resident poet of the beach.

Amiri Baraka, the noted poet, playwright and co-founder of the Black
Arts Movement of the 1960=B9s, will headline two special events on
campus. At 4 p.m., the widely published author plans to present
a Master Class for RIT students and others interested in writing poetry,
fiction or creative nonfiction.

Following, at 7:30 p.m., his award-winning play,Dutchman, will be performed
by the theater troupe Many Voices, co-produced with Maplewood Performing
Arts Center. Both events are free and open to the public.

The Dutchman debuted in 1964, and received the Obie Award for
outstanding Off-Broadway play. It was made into a feature film in
1966, and has been sighted as the first major work of the Black Arts
Movement, and remains a classic commentary on race, class and gender
in the United States. For more than a half-century, Baraka=B9s dramas,
poetry and jazz criticism have earned him international acclaim and
numerous awards including the 1984 American Book Award, the
PEN-Faulkner Award, the Langston Hughes Medal and the National
Endowment for the Arts Poetry Award.

The performance is sponsored by Poets and Writers Inc, with public
funds from the New York State Council on the Arts. Additional funds
are provided by RIT=B9s Department of English, Department of Fine Arts,
Office of Special Projects and Office of Student Affairs and NTID=B9s
Department of Performing Arts, and private donors through Many Voices
Productions.

Subject:      a new poetry collection by rob mclennan: 52 flowers (or,
              a perth edge) -- an essay on phil hall --

newly published by Lary Bremner's Obvious Epiphanies Press (Japan):


	52 flowers (or, a perth edge)
	-- an essay on Phil Hall --
	by rob mclennan
	$10

52 flowers (or, a perth edge) exists as an essay-in-poems, a sequence
responding to the "Ontario Gothic" poetry of Perth, Ontario poet Phil
Hall, focusing on the Griffin-nominated An Oak Hunch (Brick, 2005). If the
best response to a poem, as Margaret Atwood once said, is another poem,
then this, in fact, is the finest response.

Lary Bremner, now living in Japan, was the original editor/publisher of
Vancouver's 1980s/90s Tsunami Editions (later given over to Michael
Barnholden), publishing early works by Lisa Robertson, Deanna Ferguson,
Dan Farrell & others.

also available, Bremner's own work as well (as Lary Timewell);

Why I'm Posting Bail Money for Julian Assange (A statement
from Michael Moore)

Tuesday, December 14th, 2010

Friends,

Yesterday, in the Westminster Magistrates Court in London,
the lawyers for WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange presented
to the judge a document from me stating that I have put up
$20,000 of my own money to help bail Mr. Assange out of jail.

Furthermore, I am publicly offering the assistance of my
website, my servers, my domain names and anything else I can
do to keep WikiLeaks alive and thriving as it continues its
work to expose the crimes that were concocted in secret and
carried out in our name and with our tax dollars.

We were taken to war in Iraq on a lie. Hundreds of thousands
are now dead. Just imagine if the men who planned this war
crime back in 2002 had had a WikiLeaks to deal with. They
might not have been able to pull it off. The only reason they
thought they could get away with it was because they had a
guaranteed cloak of secrecy. That guarantee has now been
ripped from them, and I hope they are never able to operate
in secret again.

So why is WikiLeaks, after performing such an important
public service, under such vicious attack? Because they have
outed and embarrassed those who have covered up the truth.
The assault on them has been over the top:

**Sen. Joe Lieberman says WikiLeaks "has violated the
Espionage Act."

**The New Yorker's George Packer calls Assange "super-
secretive, thin-skinned, [and] megalomaniacal."

**Sarah Palin claims he's "an anti-American operative with
blood on his hands" whom we should pursue "with the same
urgency we pursue al Qaeda and Taliban leaders."

**Democrat Bob Beckel (Walter Mondale's 1984 campaign
manager) said about Assange on Fox: "A dead man can't leak
stuff ... there's only one way to do it: illegally shoot the
son of a bitch."

**Republican Mary Matalin says "he's a psychopath, a
sociopath ... He's a terrorist."

**Rep. Peter A. King calls WikiLeaks a "terrorist
organization."

And indeed they are! They exist to terrorize the liars and
warmongers who have brought ruin to our nation and to others.
Perhaps the next war won't be so easy because the tables have
been turned -- and now it's Big Brother who's being watched
... by us!

WikiLeaks deserves our thanks for shining a huge spotlight on
all this. But some in the corporate-owned press have
dismissed the importance of WikiLeaks ("they've released
little that's new!") or have painted them as simple
anarchists ("WikiLeaks just releases everything without any
editorial control!"). WikiLeaks exists, in part, because the
mainstream media has failed to live up to its responsibility.
The corporate owners have decimated newsrooms, making it
impossible for good journalists to do their job. There's no
time or money anymore for investigative journalism. Simply
put, investors don't want those stories exposed. They like
their secrets kept ... as secrets.

I ask you to imagine how much different our world would be if
WikiLeaks had existed 10 years ago. Take a look at this
photo. That's Mr. Bush about to be handed a "secret" document
on August 6th, 2001. Its heading read: "Bin Ladin Determined
To Strike in US." And on those pages it said the FBI had
discovered "patterns of suspicious activity in this country
consistent with preparations for hijackings." Mr. Bush
decided to ignore it and went fishing for the next four
weeks.

But if that document had been leaked, how would you or I have
reacted? What would Congress or the FAA have done? Was there
not a greater chance that someone, somewhere would have done
something if all of us knew about bin Laden's impending
attack using hijacked planes?

But back then only a few people had access to that document.
Because the secret was kept, a flight school instructor in
San Diego who noticed that two Saudi students took no
interest in takeoffs or landings, did nothing. Had he read
about the bin Laden threat in the paper, might he have called
the FBI? (Please read this essay by former FBI Agent Coleen
Rowley, Time's 2002 co-Person of the Year, about her belief
that had WikiLeaks been around in 2001, 9/11 might have been
prevented.)

Or what if the public in 2003 had been able to read "secret"
memos from Dick Cheney as he pressured the CIA to give him
the "facts" he wanted in order to build his false case for
war? If a WikiLeaks had revealed at that time that there
were, in fact, no weapons of mass destruction, do you think
that the war would have been launched -- or rather, wouldn't
there have been calls for Cheney's arrest?

Openness, transparency -- these are among the few weapons the
citizenry has to protect itself from the powerful and the
corrupt. What if within days of August 4th, 1964 -- after the
Pentagon had made up the lie that our ship was attacked by
the North Vietnamese in the Gulf of Tonkin -- there had been
a WikiLeaks to tell the American people that the whole thing
was made up? I guess 58,000 of our soldiers (and 2 million
Vietnamese) might be alive today.

Instead, secrets killed them.

For those of you who think it's wrong to support Julian
Assange because of the sexual assault allegations he's being
held for, all I ask is that you not be naive about how the
government works when it decides to go after its prey. Please
-- never, ever believe the "official story." And regardless
of Assange's guilt or innocence (see the strange nature of
the allegations here), this man has the right to have bail
posted and to defend himself. I have joined with filmmakers
Ken Loach and John Pilger and writer Jemima Khan in putting
up the bail money -- and we hope the judge will accept this
and grant his release today.

Might WikiLeaks cause some unintended harm to diplomatic
negotiations and U.S. interests around the world? Perhaps.
But that's the price you pay when you and your government
take us into a war based on a lie. Your punishment for
misbehaving is that someone has to turn on all the lights in
the room so that we can see what you're up to. You simply
can't be trusted. So every cable, every email you write is
now fair game. Sorry, but you brought this upon yourself. No
one can hide from the truth now. No one can plot the next Big
Lie if they know that they might be exposed.

And that is the best thing that WikiLeaks has done.
WikiLeaks, God bless them, will save lives as a result of
their actions. And any of you who join me in supporting them
are committing a true act of patriotism. Period.

I stand today in absentia with Julian Assange in London and I
ask the judge to grant him his release. I am willing to
guarantee his return to court with the bail money I have
wired to said court. I will not allow this injustice to
continue unchallenged.

Yours, Michael Moore

P.S. You can read the statement I filed today in the London
court here.

P.P.S. If you're reading this in London, please go support
Julian Assange and WikiLeaks at a demonstration at 1 PM
today, Tuesday the 14th, in front of the Westminster court.

Why I'm Posting Bail Money for Julian Assange (A statement
from Michael Moore)

Tuesday, December 14th, 2010

Friends,

Yesterday, in the Westminster Magistrates Court in London,
the lawyers for WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange presented
to the judge a document from me stating that I have put up
$20,000 of my own money to help bail Mr. Assange out of jail.

Furthermore, I am publicly offering the assistance of my
website, my servers, my domain names and anything else I can
do to keep WikiLeaks alive and thriving as it continues its
work to expose the crimes that were concocted in secret and
carried out in our name and with our tax dollars.

We were taken to war in Iraq on a lie. Hundreds of thousands
are now dead. Just imagine if the men who planned this war
crime back in 2002 had had a WikiLeaks to deal with. They
might not have been able to pull it off. The only reason they
thought they could get away with it was because they had a
guaranteed cloak of secrecy. That guarantee has now been
ripped from them, and I hope they are never able to operate
in secret again.

So why is WikiLeaks, after performing such an important
public service, under such vicious attack? Because they have
outed and embarrassed those who have covered up the truth.
The assault on them has been over the top:

**Sen. Joe Lieberman says WikiLeaks "has violated the
Espionage Act."

**The New Yorker's George Packer calls Assange "super-
secretive, thin-skinned, [and] megalomaniacal."

**Sarah Palin claims he's "an anti-American operative with
blood on his hands" whom we should pursue "with the same
urgency we pursue al Qaeda and Taliban leaders."

**Democrat Bob Beckel (Walter Mondale's 1984 campaign
manager) said about Assange on Fox: "A dead man can't leak
stuff ... there's only one way to do it: illegally shoot the
son of a bitch."

**Republican Mary Matalin says "he's a psychopath, a
sociopath ... He's a terrorist."

**Rep. Peter A. King calls WikiLeaks a "terrorist
organization."

And indeed they are! They exist to terrorize the liars and
warmongers who have brought ruin to our nation and to others.

What makes one weep is the obstinancy with which neoliberal ideologues pers=
ist in their belief that society is really a
marketplace composed entirely of people all of whose decisions are  based e=
xclusively on rational calculations of
economic self interest.=20
Student riots in London over plans to implement the Brown report must be a =
puzzle to its authors.  New Zealand
tried something similar, with smaller fee hikes for sure, but the outcome h=
as neverthless been a  student debt
bill so huge it has been an election issue ever since.  By and large studen=
ts continue to have a healthy taste for immediate
gratiification and arts enrolments have not suffered in the way the ideolog=
ues  have hoped.

"What a beautiful set of circumstances! What a

like Chekhov=92s short stories=ADthe more that gets
left out, the more they seem to contain=85 One can
hear echoes from all the various

into a mind, but a person, a personality, this

ax is once again binding up a year rich in print. Our hand bound volume =0A=
of Drum Hadley=E2=80=99s poems has been published, and pages of words and m=

And let's not forget about the noble 22-year-old whistleblower:

http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/12/14/manning/index.html

"That's a whistleblower in the purest and most noble form: discovering
government secrets of criminal and corrupt acts and then publicizing them to
the world not for profit, not to give other nations an edge, but to trigger
"worldwide discussion, debates, and reforms."

>> stuff ... there's only one way to do it: illegally shoot the
>> son of a bitch."
>>
>> **Republican Mary Matalin says "he's a psychopath, a

>> WikiLeaks deserves our thanks for shining a huge spotlight on

>> dismissed the importance of WikiLeaks ("they've released
>> little that's new!") or have painted them as simple
>> anarchists ("WikiLeaks just releases everything without any
>> editorial control!"). WikiLeaks exists, in part, because the
>> mainstream media has failed to live up to its responsibility.
>> The corporate owners have decimated newsrooms, making it
>> impossible for good journalists to do their job. There's no
>> time or money anymore for investigative journalism. Simply
>> put, investors don't want those stories exposed. They like
>> their secrets kept ... as secrets.
>>
>> I ask you to imagine how much different our world would be if
>> WikiLeaks had existed 10 years ago. Take a look at this
>> photo. That's Mr. Bush about to be handed a "secret" document
>> on August 6th, 2001. Its heading read: "Bin Ladin Determined
>> To Strike in US." And on those pages it said the FBI had
>> discovered "patterns of suspicious activity in this country
>> consistent with preparations for hijackings." Mr. Bush
>> decided to ignore it and went fishing for the next four
>> weeks.
>>
>> But if that document had been leaked, how would you or I have
>> reacted? What would Congress or the FAA have done? Was there
>> not a greater chance that someone, somewhere would have done
>> something if all of us knew about bin Laden's impending
>> attack using hijacked planes?
>>
>> But back then only a few people had access to that document.
>> Because the secret was kept, a flight school instructor in
>> San Diego who noticed that two Saudi students took no
>> interest in takeoffs or landings, did nothing. Had he read
>> about the bin Laden threat in the paper, might he have called
>> the FBI? (Please read this essay by former FBI Agent Coleen
>> Rowley, Time's 2002 co-Person of the Year, about her belief
>> that had WikiLeaks been around in 2001, 9/11 might have been
>> prevented.)
>>
>> Or what if the public in 2003 had been able to read "secret"
>> memos from Dick Cheney as he pressured the CIA to give him
>> the "facts" he wanted in order to build his false case for
>> war? If a WikiLeaks had revealed at that time that there
>> were, in fact, no weapons of mass destruction, do you think
>> that the war would have been launched -- or rather, wouldn't
>> there have been calls for Cheney's arrest?
>>
>> Openness, transparency -- these are among the few weapons the
>> citizenry has to protect itself from the powerful and the
>> corrupt. What if within days of August 4th, 1964 -- after the
>> Pentagon had made up the lie that our ship was attacked by
>> the North Vietnamese in the Gulf of Tonkin -- there had been
>> a WikiLeaks to tell the American people that the whole thing
>> was made up? I guess 58,000 of our soldiers (and 2 million
>> Vietnamese) might be alive today.
>>
>> Instead, secrets killed them.
>>
>> For those of you who think it's wrong to support Julian
>> Assange because of the sexual assault allegations he's being
>> held for, all I ask is that you not be naive about how the
>> government works when it decides to go after its prey. Please
>> -- never, ever believe the "official story." And regardless
>> of Assange's guilt or innocence (see the strange nature of
>> the allegations here), this man has the right to have bail
>> posted and to defend himself. I have joined with filmmakers
>> Ken Loach and John Pilger and writer Jemima Khan in putting
>> up the bail money -- and we hope the judge will accept this
>> and grant his release today.
>>
>> Might WikiLeaks cause some unintended harm to diplomatic
>> negotiations and U.S. interests around the world? Perhaps.
>> But that's the price you pay when you and your government

>> And that is the best thing that WikiLeaks has done.

The Segue Foundation, Inc.

300 Bowery

New York, NY 10012

seguefoundation@verizon.net



Segue Foundation is poor, but doing great. It's the end of the year so
please send us a check for $100 if you can (less or more is ok, too) made
payable to: Segue Foundation and send to Segue Foundation, 300 Bowery, NY,
NY 10012.



Segue is poor

NYSCA funding has been reduced due to state budget cuts. Sales are somewhat
lower this year due to the recession. So you check is worth more than ever
this year. I'd hope you each can find $100 or more but smaller donations are
welcome.



Segue is doing great

This year Roof published four books most recently the spectacular and
lubricious Nada Gordon's Scented Rushes. Really folks, this poetry is hot
and there are graphics. In this fall season we also published the exquisite
spanglish, designy Edwin Torres' Yes Thing No Thing. Torres vertical and
horizontal book breaks the mold of identity poetics reaching far beyond any
one language. This spring we published Joan Retallack's Procedural Elegies /
Western Civ Con't/ which won the 10 best books award from Art Forum. And
Elizabeth Fodaski's Document, a book of surprising and elegant poems that
makes me think it's possible to write a lyric.



And your donation helps us to pay the poets who read at the Segue at the
Bowery series every Saturday at 4pm. Recent readers include Rod Smith, Anne
Waldman, and Allen Fisher. We continue to pursue excellence here as
elsewhere in this 30 year series started by Ted Greenwald and Charles
Bernstein.



So please take out your checkbook and write a check to Segue Foundation.
Please do it now. You'll be able to write it off your taxes and frame the
check image on your statement.



End of Year Wishes,

James

the blurb sound about right. your brief listserv andecdotes had a sort of C=

My only seasonal poem, as far as I can remember.


BY WAY OF THE SEASON


1

After its struggle the gazelle
surrenders to the lion's grip, useless
to fight. Does it think then, does it think
'if only I'd dodged to the right. If only.
Maybe next time.'
As the cat disembowels it and begins to feed.

Farewell to the hills
farewell to the herd
farewell to water hole and tender grasses
and the joy of the young at the teat.

2

At moments when the consequences of choice are upon us we say
'this can't be all there is,' but it can. Regret, nostalgia and longing,
on the other hand, are ready gifts, one can live
as if there were choices with no consequences, as if
the life could be unlived
and lived again.

3

Day before Christmas in the supermarket the Stones are singing "Can't get no
satisfaction," but we try & we try & we try & and we try
and we buy something.

4

No way   no way
elusive as wind.

5

Stories and the stories of stories.
A vocabulary of places gathered and left.
Putting death aside, one wonders whether to climb that distant hill, as in
the conservation of matter.
There are so many windows to look through.
Opposite, a building seems to wear as a crown the trees
             beyond it. Close one eye or the other
to recover its true flatness. If I say
'rock dove' do you see 'pigeon?'

6

No gull rests now on the cross above the church's triangular facade, but
             it's apparently a perch
reserved for gulls to take turns at.
So much for religion. One prays
to invest oneself in the known and unknown places,
the simplicity of the abandoned and the immanence of ruins.
Ghost-whispers.

'I am the demon that whimpers at night,'
he said, and the pigeons
(or doves) ride even the steepest wires. The oblique
is granted them. Across the street
in front of the travel agency
a gruff Santa makes Christmas noises
in Caribbean Spanish. For a moment I thought it the ghost
rising through the radiator from the apartment below.
He dances now to "The Entertainer" played on a portable keyboard.
Ragtime Spanish Santa from the Dominican Republic.
And what would Dominic have made of this? 'Church
of the Immaculate Deception,' he might have said. As in
'I bring you pestilence'
he might have said.
It was an epidemic of grace.

7

That year three virgins bore sons.

Zeus the King displayed his thunderbolts.
Chango fell as a shower of gold.
And Chac arrived as rain.

Where you find it bring joy.

*EXTENSIVE IMMANENCE*


the stated goal of EXTENSIVE IMMANENCE is to publish very long works of
experimental literature. each text is longer than 1,200 pages. these are
sometimes written by computer manipulation, sometimes by human-hands on a
computer keyboard, sometimes by email collaboration, other instances by
combinations of any of the previous means.

as a stated length, more than 1,200 pages describes the EXTENSIVE part of
the press name.

a quality of IMMANENCE is more complicated and evanescent. it is a term with
as many definitions as people who use it. a general description, not a
definition, would go something like: it covers the universe, a big claim for
a work of literature, but this wont be the first time literature makes a
grand claim.

a title like EXTENSIVE IMMANENCE could be seen as a tautology. instead
following Gertrude Stein, who says something like: repetition is insistence,
not repetition. the works included in the press-identity must be very long.

all texts are free to read, free to download, and free to print out. they
are located at links on www.archive.org. when you click a link on the 'links
to texts' page, you will be directed there.

My morning just got knocked askew by Verse.  Watched the trailer, then
the two chapters, then went to the blog, watched the extras, then
listened to an interview, and now -- it's time for lunch.

Great work.

Israeli Poet Karen Akalay-Gut: An orphan who has found a home.

Interview with Doug Holder.





In an email from Poet Karen Akalay-Gut she writes:





"When I was just beginning to feel at home in the Israeli poetry scene,=20=

the author and editor Ben Zion Tomer was looking over a piece of mine=20
he was going to publish and said, =93You know, you were born an=20
orphan.=94 The shock I felt was one of recognition not insult =96 for the=
 first=20
time someone had understood the basis of my writing more clearly than=20
I had. The idea of exile, of perspective, was something I had carried=20
with me from the days of my childhood, when my parents, long-term=20
refugees and now new immigrants to the United States, chose to share=20
their freshly acquired dwelling with displaced persons and concentration=20=

camp survivors. The religious education I was given in a Jewish Day=20
School which emphasized Judaism as its center and Israel as the new=20
home for the Jews was balanced by the afterschool Yiddish Farband=20
Classes which focused on socialism and community. Home in other=20
words, was always relative. But when I first came to Israel as a=20
teenager I understood that for me there was an emotional absolute,=20
that no matter how much it might be strange, and no matter how much=20
I could argue about its directions, this was where I belonged."=20





Karen Alkalay-Gut was born in London in the Blitz (March 29,1945), and=20=

was educated in the United States. She received her Ph.D in English=20
literature at the University of Rochester. In 1972 She moved to Israel,=20=

and has been teaching poetry at Israeli universities since then. In 1977=20=

she joined the faculty at Tel Aviv University. In addition to a biography=
=20
of the poet Adelaide Crapsey, Alkalay-Gut has published numerous=20
articles on modern American poetry, Victorian literature and fiction, and=
=20
studies of poetry and popular culture. In addition to over twenty books=20=

of poetry and a number of CDs with pianist Liz Magnes, Roi Yarkoni,=20
and others, new work scheduled for 2010 include: a compact disk of her=20=

poetry with Panic Ensemble; a dual language collection, Belly Dancing=20
in Tel Aviv, will appear with Edizioni Kolibris in Italy; and an edition =
of=20
Selected Poems will be appearing in Hebrew translation.



I was suppose to meet her in Israeli and talk to her class in 2007, but=20=

the University was on strike and it never happened. I met her a couple=20=

of years later at McLean Hospital when she was researching a book on=20
Sexton, and Plath. Gut is planning a trip this Winter in 2001, and=20
hopefully will make a trip to the promised land of Somerville and a=20
meeting of the Bagel Bards.=20





Do you think being born in London during the Blitz had a subliminal=20
effect on you as a poet and writer?



I was born on the last night of the buzz bombs, so in a way I brought=20
the peace, but the real effect on me came through my parents: for=20
them, the blitz in London was a relief. They were refugees, had been=20
fleeing for years before WWII, fled from Lida in Lithuania to Danzig in=20=

1930, were persecuted for my father=92s communist background in Danzig,=20=

and escaped that city on the night before Hitler invaded, on the last=20
bus out. By the time they got to England they must have been wrecks,=20
but the tragedy of the war only came to them when I was born. It was=20
then that my mother learned that all of her family had been killed in=20
the war. That must have influenced the way I was raised, and the=20
expectations my parents had for me. I think the enormous tragedies=20
that were uncovered at the time of my birth had more than a subliminal=20=

effect on me =96 they are part of my identity.



In your poetry and in your life--you exhibit the feeling of being an=20
orphan. Literally you are not--but metaphorically you are. Explain?



In a way I wanted to be an orphan, to grow up without the burden of=20
my family=92s past. To grow up without the past of my people, without=20
the imperative of my gender, without the rules that seem to dominate=20
the way we think. I was always breaking out of traditions, even while I=20=

was enjoying my own versions of traditional things. For example, when=20
Isaac Bashevis Singer=92s book, Satan in Goray, came out in English, I=20=

was sixteen, and I devoured the book. He wasn=92t famous yet, and was=20
invited by my parents=92 in Rochester to lecture in Yiddish. His lecture=20=

was wild, rowdy, nothing like any Yiddish literature the cultured Yiddish=
=20
audience had experienced, and the audience was appalled. Afterward,=20
my mother brought him to me, and said to him, =93Here, SHE will be=20
interested in what you have to say!=94 That was meant as a little insult=20=

to both of us, but I was overjoyed to be coupled with my new hero.

You moved to Israel in 1972 from the States. Israel is a place where=20
many people go to find themselves--they are disconnected where they=20
presently live--and are looking for meaning--a sort of existential crisis=
.=20
Was that how it was for you?

I was perfectly happy in Rochester, New York. There were many ways in=20
which the city, the schools, the centers, the university nurtured me in a=
=20
way that is rarely available to people. For years I had saved up to go to=
=20
Europe, but when I was 20, and had enough money, my=20
parents =93strongly urged=94 me to go to Israel instead. I wasn=92t inter=
ested,=20
but being a good girl, went along, thinking I=92d catch a flight to Greec=
e=20
from Tel Aviv. The moment I landed in Israel I fell in love, and=20
continued to fall in love with every single person I met, every place I=20=

encountered. So the first chance I got after I finished school I moved to=
=20
Israel. It wasn=92t easy, and I have political conflicts all the time, bu=
t=20
existentially, I=92m where I=92m supposed to be.=20



You use this quote in your collection of poetry " Miracles"

=46rom far away everything looks like a miracle,=20

but up close even a miracle doesn=92t look like one.=20

- Yehuda Amichai, =93Miracles=94





Is this a call to you for immediate experience--the tangible over=20
conjecture?



I thought I was simply referring to the fact that there are millions of=20=

miracles that occur every day =96 and we usually don=92t notice them=20
because we=92re so involved in our own survival.=20



Like the Israelite in Amichai=92s poem who is busy watching the back of=20=

the man in front of him on the way out of Egypt and doesn=92t realize tha=
t=20
the parting of the Red Sea has taken place. Medicine seems a miracle=20
to me =96 the stuff that makes you better when you=92re sick. But for=20
Amichai the real miracles are the ones we experience all the time =96=20
little amazing details, remarkable in themselves, and of which poetry is=20=

created.







You have written a great deal about Slyvia Plath and Anne Sexton. They=20=

both seemed like orphans in the context of their tragic lives. Is this=20=

what attracted you?



My initial attraction was to their boldness and daring, but the more I=20=

read their poetry the more I saw what wonderful artists they were,=20
asserting madness and freedom but with such control and=20
craftsmanship that their art is often invisible. The drama attracted me,=20=

and the art keeps me attracted. My =91orphans=92 have the freedom=20
determine their status. Even though my heart breaks every time I think=20=

of what Anne Sexton=92s treatment should have been, and how much=20
damage her mistreatment did, that isn=92t what calls me to her. I am=20
drawn to their pinpoint analysis of the social imperatives that were=20
imprisoning them, and their desire to create their own destinies.







There is no one right way to write a poem. How do you go about it?=20



When I was nine or ten, a wise Yiddish poet was boarding with my=20
family, and when he saw that I was making some efforts at composition=20
he gave me this advice: =93Never write if you can sleep without it.=94 I =
have=20
thousands of ideas and phrases in my head all the time, but most of=20
the time they will dissipate if I can ignore them, but when the words=20
start to overwhelm me I jot them down and then begin to work on=20
them, to hone them into the poem that reflects the original thought,=20
and/or to develop them into what they could be.







What school of poetry are you in or have been expelled from?=20

Orphans don=92t go to school.



I=92ve been teaching poetry for forty five years. Shakespeare, Chaucer,=20=

Tennyson, Rossetti, Wilde, Williams, Stevens, Roethke, Lowell,=20
Pinsky... I learn from them, from my students, from my research.=20
There=92s also my rock group =96 for a few years I was performing with th=
em=20
and in the past few years I=92ve been writing lyrics for them. It makes m=
e=20
more aware of the sound of words, how they fit together to make their=20
own meaning. Maybe the whole world is my school. There are a group of=20
poems pasted on the wall in my bathroom =96 they were written from=20
contemplation there =96 but they are about how it feels to be a sink, the=
=20
responsibilities of soap, what is hiding behind the shower curtain, stuff=
=20
like that. Was the bathroom my school?



A summer dress hangs on two pegs


The sash flutters out, like a butterfly
Who knows where it belongs
and the wind fills out the flowered bosom
as if spirit alone
was enough to give it life

It's arrived.  It's 430 in the morning, can't sleep.  Everyone is
celebrating the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell.  Three children die
of war-related injuries every single day in Afghanistan.  That's not
an abstract statistic, it's very real, at least to me.

I'm a queer man who has watched the queer community bow down and
anxiously wait for the votes to come in.  Do they want us?  Are we
good enough?  Will WE TOO be allowed to kill three children in
Afghanistan?  Oh I hope so, I really want to kill some babies.

It's 430 in the morning, or so.  This world really is worth losing
sleep over.  I love this world.  But it's pretty fucking scary.  More
than ever.

The queer community was so bad-ass at one time.  Coretta Scott King
spoke once about gay men and lesbians marching with her and her
husband in Selma when they didn't even have rights of their own.  But
when she said rights I DON'T THINK she meant the military.  Because
Coretta Scott King and her husband Martin Luther King were very much
opposed to the war in Vietnam.

Is this an incredible ruse?  Has the gay and lesbian community been
TRICKED into thinking that this is a good thing to want?  To be part
of this big, evil killing machine that kills for the American
corporate interests?

Poetry has answered this.  And I'm so grateful for poetry.  Where
would we be without it?

Dear everybody,
Mondo Bummer is a small press in San Francisco that publishes poetry and =
fiction in a disappointing way. Their latest title is Any Group Can =
Claim Responsibility and Other Poems, by Adam Tobin (that's me!).
http://mondobummer.blogspot.com/2010/12/adam-tobins-any-group-can-claim.h=
tml
These are frustrated lyric poems (in quatrains! with occasional rhyme!), =
and I am a frustrating lyric poet.  Sorry.  But they are dense* with =
allusions to and facts about the world you never knew.  When I find gum =
in my mouth, I chew.
"Poisoned wellsprings of received wisdom" is the nicest thing anybody =
has ever said about these poems.
http://mondobummer.blogspot.com/2010/12/adam-tobins-any-group-can-claim.h=
tml=20
You can buy copies directly from Mondo Bummer using paypal, cash or =
barter. They cost $2.00, or something of equal value. Shipping is =
included in the price.
Yours very truly,
Adam Tobin

Here is a representative quatrain:

Fake faces made of brick are built for profit.=20
I wanted to ask you a question, so I raised my hand.
The proper posture will make you more aware.
I am not fluent in body language.

Pavement Saw Chapbook Contest: Deadline 12/31
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Submit electronically, save the hassle of printing out a manuscript and have your funds support poetry not the post office! Directly enter by using our website http://www.pavementsaw.org/pages/chapcontest.htm

$500 and 50 copies of the winning chapbook will be awarded to the winner. In addition to the prize winner, at least one other manuscript will be published under a standard royalty contract (author paid 10% of press run). Everyone is allowed to submit regardless of previous publication history. Every entrant will receive the equivalent cost of the entry fee in Pavement Saw Press titles.

Unlike many publishers whose collections are printed one copy at a time and therefore lack a large circulation, our chapbooks are published in a first edition of 400 copies plus overage. While chapbooks rarely receive exposure, ours have been reviewed in Poets and Writers, Publishers Weekly, The Georgia Review, Small Press Review and many others. Our previous winners have had subsequent full length books appear from a bevy of publishers including Curbstone Press, Cleveland State University Press, Bear Star Press, University of Georgia, and Hanging Loose Press.

Submit up to 32 pages of poetry. Include a signed cover letter with your name, address, phone number, e-mail, publication credits, a brief biography and the title of the chapbook. Include a cover page with your contact information and the chapbook title. Include a second page with the chapbook title only. Do not include your name on any pages inside the manuscript except for the first title page. No need for a contents page. All chapbooks are selected blindly / anonymously. Manuscripts will be considered until December 31st, 2010. Entry fee: $15 for US entries, $18 overseas, $21 electronic (world wide).

If you wish to submit electronically, send $21.00 via paypal to info@pavementsaw.org. Then e-mail the manuscript as an attachment to the same address and we will send you an e-mail confirmation that your entry is all set. Electronic submissions need to be sent as PDF files or as word (.doc or .docx) files. Other formats are not accepted. The extra cost is to cover the paypal fees as well as the time, labor, ink, and so on, to print out your manuscript. Or use our website http://www.pavementsaw.org/pages/chapcontest.htm

If you wish to send via regular mail accompany your manuscript with a check in the amount of $15.00 payable to Pavement Saw Press. All contributors to the contest will receive books, chapbooks and journals equal to, or more than, the entry fee. Add $3 (US) for other countries to cover the extra postal charge. Do not include an SASE for notification of results. Do not send the only copy of your work. All manuscripts are recycled and individual comments on the manuscripts cannot be made. This year the editor will be the judge and, as it should be, he promises not to chose former students, former or potential sexual partners, press interns, or people that can make him famous. A decision will be reached in March. Entries should be sent to our address at the bottom of the page.

An interesting take on my volume of plays from BlazeVox books--available
via SPD, West House Books, BlazeVox, Amazon, etc.  Sutton comments at
length on Lost Poet--a work that explores the nuances of the Chivers-Poe
connection, the "peculiar institution," metaphysics, Swedenborg,
Manifest Destiny, and other facets of the Pre-Cambrian age of American
lit.  Enjoy!  Jess

It's interesting to see the effect of Wikipedia on the evolution of the
Net, esp. on the humanities.  In 2007 I defined Haptic Poetry on
Wikipedia, connecting it with several well known names and a host of
others. Since then I've tracked the definition to Korea and beyond and
am most recently happy to see haptic poetry groups crystallizing around
the nucleus of that definition.  Jess

Plagiarist Codex
Built in 1988 for the first Festival of Plagiarism produced to
illustrate this problem. The document is a fake Mayan Codex as
allegedly the oldest artistic manifesto Plagiatorentums. Already the
photocopied book covers leave no doubt that this is not ambitious
forgeries, but typical, easily identifiable Mail Art is, although
would be even with the limited technical means of xerography, the
impression of a pirated copy of one was lost or under lock held
manuscript easy to produce. The Plagiarist Codex A look at the
supposed Mayan Codex gives doubts about the Fabricated of the
document, for they still gave out for good. (google translation of

Pavement Saw Chapbook Contest: Deadline (Postmark by) 12/31

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Submit electronically, save the hassle of printing out a manuscript and have your funds support poetry not the post office! Directly enter by using our website http://www.pavementsaw.org/pages/chapcontest.htm

$500 and 50 copies of the winning chapbook will be awarded to the winner. In addition to the prize winner, at least one other manuscript will be published under a standard royalty contract (author paid 10% of press run). Everyone is allowed to submit regardless of previous publication history. Every entrant will receive the equivalent cost of the entry fee in Pavement Saw Press titles.

Unlike many publishers whose collections are printed one copy at a time and therefore lack a large circulation, our chapbooks are published in a first edition of 400 copies plus overage. While chapbooks rarely receive exposure, ours have been reviewed in Poets and Writers, Publishers Weekly, The Georgia Review, Small Press Review and many others. Our previous winners have had subsequent full length books appear from a bevy of publishers including Curbstone Press, Cleveland State University Press, Bear Star Press, University of Georgia, and Hanging Loose Press.

Submit up to 32 pages of poetry. Include a signed cover letter with your name, address, phone number, e-mail, publication credits, a brief biography and the title of the chapbook. Include a cover page with your contact information and the chapbook title. Include a second page with the chapbook title only. Do not include your name on any pages inside the manuscript except for the first title page. No need for a contents page. All chapbooks are selected blindly / anonymously. Manuscripts will be considered until December 31st, 2010. Entry fee: $15 for US entries, $18 overseas, $21 electronic (world wide).

If you wish to submit electronically, send $21.00 via paypal to info@pavementsaw.org. Then e-mail the manuscript as an attachment to the same address and we will send you an e-mail confirmation that your entry is all set. Electronic submissions need to be sent as PDF files or as word (.doc or .docx) files. Other formats are not accepted. The extra cost is to cover the paypal fees as well as the time, labor, ink, and so on, to print out your manuscript. Or use our website http://www.pavementsaw.org/pages/chapcontest.htm

If you wish to send via regular mail, have your envelope postmarked by December 31st adn accompany your manuscript with a check in the amount of $15.00 payable to Pavement Saw Press. All contributors to the contest will receive books, chapbooks and journals equal to, or more than, the entry fee. Add $3 (US) for other countries to cover the extra postal charge. Do not include an SASE for notification of results. Do not send the only copy of your work. All manuscripts are recycled and individual comments on the manuscripts cannot be made. This year the editor will be the judge and, as it should be, he promises not to chose former students, former or potential sexual partners, press interns, or people that can make him famous. A decision will be reached in March. Entries should be sent to our address at the bottom of the page.

May E-Poetry Presentation precis (Buffalo, NY)

I will talk about the fluid semiotics of virtual world productions, in
terms of Kristevan semiosis and fluid logics governing both avatar and
object behaviors through scriptings and 'signage' embedded in scripts or
within the visible local and fluid landscape itself. I will relate all of
this to the future of human/organic society on the planet, with or without
the Internet, and I will do this in fifteen minutes. I would like audio-
video output for laptop, but will not need online connectivity.

Theses:

1. Culture is always already virtual.
2. Culture is always already abject and inscriptive.
3. Abjection and inscription are entangled, irresolute, corroding both
truth functions and definitions.
4. Culture is all the way down; every organism is a priori cultural.
5. Culture is intimately related to alterity.
6. Virtual worlds permit logical, physical, organic, sexual, linguistic,
and psychological flows, without fundamental basis.
7. Virtual worlds are the future of the exploration of inscription,
culture, and the imaginary.
8. A parabola leads from virtual worlds to the true-real physical world,
which is already produced, itself as virtual.
9. Physics is the structure of the true-real physical world.
10. The appetition of physical returns us to thesis 1.
