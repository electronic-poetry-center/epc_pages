Anthany James Dawson

August 11, 2003 - Nancy Dawson, family and friends, with the support of
Victoria, BC's aboriginal and non-aboriginal community, gather today for

what has become an annual memorial walk, in remembrance of Nancy's son

August 11, 2003 - Nancy Dawson, family and friends, with the support of
Victoria, BC's aboriginal and non-aboriginal community, gather today for

what has become an annual memorial walk, in remembrance of Nancy's son
Anthany who died in police custody. The walk begins at 4pm, leaving
Stadacona Park - Belmont and Pandora Streets - and then to Bank Street.
The walk is described as a peaceful celebration of Anthany's life. The
walk will be followed by a potluck meal at 5:30 pm at 102 Moss Street.
Anthany Dawson, a member of the Musgamagw Tsawataineuk died four years
ago after police apprehended him with force. During a coroner's inquest,

eight independent eyewitnesses testified they saw a Victoria police
officer punch or strike Anthany. Although the inquest ruled his death
accidental, many questions remain unanswered. The family failed to
persuade the government to order a public inquiry. However, a wrongful
death lawsuit is proceeding, but the family still will not have their
day in court until the fall of 2004.

Whereas:   Anthany James Dawson died under questionable circumstances

Whereas:   The facts about his death, including allegations of racism
and the use of force must be investigated in an open, independent way

Whereas:   Eight people testified at a Coroner's Inquest they saw a
police officer hit Anthany

Whereas:   Anthany Dawson's family, friends and community are demanding
real justice

Whereas: The Musgamagw Tsawataineuk Tribal Council Chiefs express their
outrage and disgust with the results of the Victoria City Police
Internal Report which was sent to the home of Anthany Dawsons mother on
the second anniversary of his death, August 13, 2001.

Whereas:  While the Victoria City Police Internal Report claims that
there is no need for any further action, Chairman William T. Cranmer
voices the frustration of the First Nations people. Eight witnesses
testified at the Inquest that they saw Constable Sheldon punch Anthany
and Constable Sheldon maintains that he did not.

Whereas: Chief Cranmer went on to state that The only proper way to deal

with this is to have a public hearing with an adjudicator present to
determine whether Constable Sheldon is telling the truth or not. We are
not asking for any favors, we are asking for answers.

Whereas: The First Nations Summit has also sent a letter to the Police
Complaint Commissioner, Don Morrison, urging him to consider a public
hearing.  As you know the treatment of First Nations persons by police
in general has been a major media topic for many years.  A public
inquiry in this case would allow for a complete and transparent
examination of the circumstances of Mr. Dawsons death and what role, if
any, the police may have played in it. wrote the  First Nations Summit
Task Group, Kathryn Teneese, Bill Wilson, and Gerald Wesley.

Whereas: The Musgamagw Tsawataineuk Tribal Council Chiefs again ask that

a public hearing be called in order to hear the statements of the eight
witnesses who saw Anthany Dawson punched by Constable Sheldon.

Therefore:   I want to find out what really happened to Anthany James
Dawson August 11, 1999

Therefore:   I support this petition for a full public inquiry and call
on the British Columbia Government to announce such an inquiry

Hello there,

Well, I'm finishing up my article on slam poetry, and I had a really interesting conversation with a poet who runs an open-mic night here. We were talking about slam poetry and I was struggling with how it connects to poetry in general. She said she thinks there are three versions of poetry, all based on the way the poem is communicated: There's poetry on the page, spoken word (which varies from reading a poem straight from the page or performing it), and slam. I'm curious about how other writers view these divisions. I'm busily pulling quotes from all the great discussions we've had on the listserv so far on this subject, and I look forward to your opinions on this.

Thanks,

Flora

I think that Slam may have arisen originally as a rebuke to the bi coastal
poetry culture since it arose in Chicago. But of late Slam has moved from
art to entertainment. The best example I can site is the difference between
types of acting. You can make allot of money, which also motivates slam, and
also have 'impact'doing Terminator films but are they art? Maybe in the
loosest sense but certainly these films are not in the same category with
say the Godfather or La Strada or other films.
So what Arnold is doing is acting but it is not innovative. That is where
Slam is now it is a formula.  Now it must be said that many 'avant
garde'poets are also dwelling in a formula as well, just look what kind of
poems get published in say Fence, for example. Regarding the artificial
trinity posed here of there being Poetry on the Page, Spoken Word and Slam
that is unfounded.  Slam is a convention for competition. Spoken word: I
dont know what that means, the Illiad was sung 4000 years ago is that a
'spoken word'poem, the Psalms were also sung but they also hold up on the
page. Most Slam poetry does not have this level of quality.  I think that
the biggest problem I have with Slam is that it is committed to 'connecting'
and it is formulaic, if there were more slam poets who did things
differently say a Slam poet who chanted his/her poems in plain chant or in
melodic tones or anything other than the same rap format perhaps they would
be on to something

Circular Descent

With a wink and a nod we are pressing Saudi Arabia to monitor charities that
are funded by the tax dollars of people who work with their hands. These
Contributions should not go to clone babies of men who love cats and strong
cheeses; they are not like us. On Tuesday, a woman, pregnant with a
terrorist was due to give birth but declined to give any details about her
terrorist's eating habits. This Terrorist girl bears a cross and a sword
that cuts the heart out of solace in broken streets.  They burned the Jews
alive in Mainz in the Ghetto in 1106 as they went on a journey.

Scientific communities have challenged statements in the past that women
pregnant with terrorists are among us. Doctors and scientists reject
terrorist cloning as irresponsible, saying the risk of creating deformed
terrorists is too great and that it poses ethical dilemmas. The doctor said
that the terrorists are "absolutely healthy." In May three women were
pregnant with terrorists. Clones born because their mother died of a water
borne disease unknown in the green-fat-land.

mexican farmers tramp through their farms with donkey drawn ploughs.
Planting a rock farm with little black soil, to make the frijoles grow
green.The ultimate goal that these farmers is to water gardens in suburbia
for the
grandchildren of paddys and dagoes. Mexican farmers Increasingly find
themselves saddled with mountains of unsold produce. The produce rots in the
trucks because people like to eat boxes and not dull colored items like
fruit.  Ask them to cut down the beef and dress it well for my table .

Women have fallen and hit the ground hard and on fire-twice in the history
of lower Manhattan. These aliens are so unlike the rest of us; they don't
spend weekends at games and they are mostly communists when they are not
watering lawns in suburbia. We left our brownness somewhere between Ellis
Island, the Triangle Shirtwaste fire and Sacco and Vanzetti.  The clones
live in Central New Jersey and they are green with envy.

Subject:
Neural Skeins and Digital Skins -- November on -empyre-


The parallels between the internet and a biological system are many.
Growth and decay, circulation and disease are symptoms of these living
systems.  In our bodies, cells, neurons, bacteria and on-line, words,
memes and code-structures are vital elements of ordered, yet chaotic
process. For the month of November -empyre- delights in presenting Neural
Skeins and Digital Skins:  code, writing, and the net as a central nervous
system, with four prominent artists and theorists.

***

In a pastiche of imagery and French and English text, Tamara Lai (Belgium)
spins her intimate, visceral cyber-poems from her base in Liege.  Lai's
oeuvre includes exploration of performance, ephemerality and virtual
relations.

Alan Sondheim (US), New York based net artist and poet, conducts a
continuous meditation on cyberspace, emphasizing issues of interiority,
subjectivity, body, and language. http://www.asondheim.org/

Alessandro Ludovico (IT) publishes the critical journal neural.it in
Italian and English online.  <http://www.neural.it> and
<http://www.neural.it/english>

Florian Cramer (Germany), is a theorist on comparative net aesthetics and
literature, and lectures at the Free University Berlin.

***

As Alan writes, We collude between death and sex, to the limits of
distortion - space-time burns around configurations of terror and the
body.

The skin is always a skein of communication. Words are performative only
to the extent they can persuade physical reality beyond the sememe -
propaganda or persuasion of language.

How, as Florian asks, does 'codework' fit notions of text that were
crafted without digital code - most importantly: machine-executable
digital code - in mind, and vice versa. Is it a coincidence that, in their
poetical appropriation of low-level Internet codes, codeworks ended up
aesthetically resembling concrete poetry? And, apart from aesthetic
resemblances, how do computer programs relate to literature?

Join us in discussion to examine these questions and more on -empyre-.

Slam has become the Amerikkkanization of recitation of thought and beauty made palpable and entertaining to dumb down the masses-- wHich has been amerikkanada's major contribution to world history -- the perfection of mass consumption; the massa'ry of shuffle along.
Alexandrian poetry was considered the death of Ancient Greek poetry
Roman poetry hardly ever had a life as it centred itself around the invective and obsessed itself with personal attacks and degrading human emotions now thought primitive like love.

"Shall I inform you upon whom the Shayatin descends?
They descend on every lying, sinful person
Who gives ear, and most of them are liars
As for the poets, the erring ones follow them,
See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry?
And that they say what they do not do."
Surah 26 (Ash-Shu'ara/The Poets) 221-226

All eyez slam on meaning

Restoration and New Augustan poetry (what critics have called 'trivial gross and dull') was the death of english poetry as it sunk itself to the level of Roman structure played out by poetic sycophants killing content;  looking for human flaws to humiliate.
DeCONstruction + Slam = the last 10 years of this so called Hip Hop -- the death of amerikkkanadian poetry -- smart mouths replaces witt; subliminal attacks replaces subtexte and intertexturality; nifty showmanship over content, cruelty bigotry, deCONstructionist bastard thugz of the "kill em all bill gates street team out to tear shite apart and missing the content and message -- no passion only a copywrite, possible options, cool portfolios, distribution deallys and hope for mo/more scrill -- scrawlerz and crawlerz crushin the life out of our scholarz.

Repetition and Vico -- world history is cyCLICCA (E)l-- dybbuk the Homeric

The ameriKKKanadian nightmare = the world is a "collection of ghettos" (respects to Melvin Van Peebles) and we've all become like paid off Billy Pilgrims "unstuck in time" precivilrights/postreaganomics greed mechanics; niggers afraid of everything clicced up/cliqued up doin the sambo for the clappin crowds.

She said she thinks there are three versions of poetry, all based on the way the poem is communicated: There's poetry on the page, spoken word (which varies from reading a poem straight from the page or performing it), and slam. I'm curious about how other writers view these divisions. I'm busily pulling quotes from all the great discussions we've had on the listserv so far on this subject, and I look forward to your opinions on this.

just a 'note' to say hello:

I've been recording a variety of sound-sources for many
years now and have just recently put up a continuous
audio-stream of over 20 hours of recordings made this summer
in the California Delta: http://63.170.215.11:8000. (You'll
need appropriate software to listen, ie., winamp, itunes,
audion...) This features many birds and a wide variety of
ancillory noises ;) It's broadcast at 32 kbps (mp3s) -- I
like the density of the sound and the mechanical birdsong...
Will be adding more material as time goes on.

I dont know about the rest of you and maybe I am too sensitive but the use
of the word "nigga culture"is a bit offensive and frankly the US has ALWAYS
been a collection of ghettoes but I do not think we need to call these
ghettoes with words that at least for me are less than kind-- Dago, Kike,
Nigger, Spick, all of these words are equally questionable-- and
objectionable no matter what point you are trying to make--

*things of each possible relation hashing against one another*
by Juliana Spahr

Australian ethnohistorian Greg Dening argues that there are two views=20
that define the Pacific: a view from the sea (the view of those who=20
arrived from elsewhere) and the view from the land (those who were=20
already there). *things of each possible relation hashing against one=20
another* is a series of poems that opens with the view from the sea and=20
end with the view from the land and are about the ecological hashing=20
that happens as these two views meet in Hawai'i.


Juliana Spahr is the author of *Fuck You-Aloha-I Love You* (Wesleyan =
University=20
Press), *Everybody's Autonomy* (University of Alabama Press), and =
*Response* (Sun & Moon).=20
She edits the journal *Chain*with Jena Osman. She has been a resident=20

Excerpts from 'Slamming the Sonnet' (Jayne Fenton Keane, 2000)

As a postmodern version of oral poetry competitions - that have erupted
throughout history since the ancient Greeks held Battles of the Rhapsodes in
the mid 700s BC,  slam represents one of the few sites of regular access to
oral traditions within poetry. It is multicultural, multipoetic, full of
binaries, full of hype, full of promise and yet there is a sameness about
the kind of poetry that succeeds at National level. Why? Jeffrey McDaniel, a
successful Slam poet who has crossed into 'mainstream' publishing success,
concludes that 'Writing strictly for competition's sake often results in
formulaic, predictable pieces, ill-advised re-runs or sequels, in which it
seems like the poet is trying to get elected by the judges' (McDaniel, 2000,
p37)...

Much Slam poetry not only prides itself on making points, it points at you
while its making them. In general, Slam poets reject most traditional page
oriented structures for poetry (apart from the Beat Poets), choosing instead
the digestible pop lyric, the issue-byte, the get-it-off-your-chest urgency
and the 'I am the greatest' boasting narrative traditions of African
American culture. Their texts need their passion to exist. They are neutered
by the page.

you are joking, aren't you, haas?

i found some slam performances, like several art/artists, to have been a
benefit for me at a point in my life (maybe will again, who knows). whether
one considers the bulk of the work there 'quality' or not, there are
certainly things about it that put other poetry schools/communities to shame
-- the work itself is lively with defiance, persistence, rhythm, etc, not to
mention these folks often offer inclusion & a supportive community (the
actual competitions usually done w/ humor & sportsmanship). sure, there's a
lot of imitation, formula  & repetition but can you tell me you don't
hear/see that at many readings of popular or academic poetry? & surely there
must be a smattering of innovation in every form of expression, no?
sheesh.


devils' advocate again i guess

*i'm not a fan of Pop Art (same arguments) either but i'm glad it's around

NEW FROM AVEC BOOKS

DISTANT NOISE
JEAN FRÉMON

TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH BY NORMA COLE, LYDIA DAVIS,
SERGE GAVRONSKY AND COLE SWENSEN

COVER BY LOUISE BOURGEOIS

Lucid enigmas, unexpected moments of insight whose insight escapes even as
it startles, dreams that are not the author's but seem instead to dream
him. The serial poems in Distant Noise present spare scenes shot through
with surprise and the kind of truth found only in disorientation. Emperors
and students gaze across landscapes of uncertainty, and ordinary human
interaction has become a game of stilted gestures and official regulations.
The "sacred law" explored here creates its spiritual reverence by tearing
reverence apart; the sensual, quiet lyrics seem restrained by an often
unspeakable violence. These poems are both lovely and disturbing, their
precise details emptied of all but a central problem-the nature of language
and what it has done to us. The goal is not to tell us what we didn't know
we knew; instead, the poems here stand as reminders of all the things we
have never even realized that we didn't understand.
__

The brevity of the poems Jean Frémon has collected in Distant Noise is
misleading. Each line, each word almost, unleashes a set of repercussions
that echo into the distance and back into the readers mind. Like all the
most urgent poetry, it is "fragile and momentary, but momentarily
invincible."
-John Ashbery

Sublime and compelling and like no other work that exists today-whether
French, American or Chinese. Jean Frémon is a wholly singular artist, a
writer who lives in the radiant zone where poetry, philosophy and story
telling meet.
-Paul Auster


Jean Frémon is certainly one of our most profoundly inventive practitioners
of the short prose form. By means of a language somehow at once analytical
and lyrical, he probes the complex moment of enunciation itself, where
ritual and chance converge. In addition, his singular style has been
beautifully conveyed by this fine gathering of translators.
-Michael Palmer

Language taken out of body: we are listening to the horizon, to the holding
of breath. But at the same time it returns to the body with the added
weight and urgency of the large: now we feel ourselves "pushing the
sentences through [our] bodies," and sense is "more naked, more solitary,
further away, closer."
-Rosmarie Waldrop

Beautifully writ!

One nit; You wrote:

"If there is a him, if you forget"

And with that line, I need, as I read, a semicolon after "him" e.g.


"If there is a him; if you forget..." (I read both these expressions as =
complete thoughts.)

Also, you wrote the line,=20

"for fear it die in us, and" =20

On this line, I prefer to read the noun rather than the pronoun, e.g.=20

"for fear love die in us, and"=20

Agreed, these are minor tweaks, and none of my business, but then...it's =
what I do.=20

Gosh. It seems that while etherised I somehow called up the ghosts of
Pierre Joris and Gyorgy Bowering. If you guys are going to kiss in
public (and discuss your "firkin") you really ought to put some kind of

Subject:      Survey from the editors of Hip Mama magazine
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Submitted to you on behalf of Bee Lavender at Hip Mama. Responses should be
addressed to her (address below), though I am also happy to forward. I
thought many of you would find the questions intriguing.

Shanna

---------------
From: Bee Lavender <bee@hipmama.com>
Date: Fri, 31 Oct 2003 08:27:43 -0800
To:
Subject: survey (please forward)

We are political writers working on a new project addressing practical means
of educating and raising empowered and aware youth. We would like to get as
many real-life examples of politically savvy educators, mentors, activists,
parents, and kids as possible. We appreciate all responses; if you only see
one or two questions you wish to answer that is great.

If you prefer to remain anonymous, or would like to be known by name or
professional credentials, let us know.

Please forward this survey widely.

Completed surveys or questions about the project can be addressed to:

Bee Lavender: bee@hipmama.com
Anne Elizabeth Moore: anneemoore@earthlink.net

1. Do you feel children consume more media (including television, movies,
video games, and the internet) than they spend engaged in educational
pursuits either at home or in school? Which do you think they prefer, and
why? Do you think that the children in your life have the skills to
understand and critique media messages?

2. How have you or would you instruct a child in the basics of critical
engagement?

3. Have you found a means to incorporate children's individual needs and
preferences into your work with them? To state this differently, when a
child simply doesn't want to hear what you have to say, how do you respect
and acknowledge their interests without overriding and silencing their
individuality?

4. How do you incorporate active critique and engagement in your home or
personal life? Specifically, do you have strategies to incorporate criticism
when it is directed at you? When it is directed toward a belief you hold
very strongly?

5. How do you incorporate active critique and engagement in a learning
situation such as the classroom or afterschool program, or how have you seen
it incorporated with the children you raise, teach or know?

6. What has gone into your education as an activist that you feel is most
useful in developing activism in youth? For example: have any films, books,
magazines, or teachers worked especially well in inspiring action? If you
have examples that are generally more useful for adults, how would you go
about using those as teaching tools for youth?

7. If you have experienced burnout as an activist, teacher, or parent, how
have you overcome exhaustion to remain involved?

8. Do you incorporate your activist interests into non-political areas of
your life? If so, do you have practical strategies that work with kids?

9. When working with, raising, or interacting with youth, what models have
you used? Examples might include personal mentors, books, political
organizations, etc.

10. If you are raising, mentoring, or teaching kids you may have been in a
position to talk about issues that inspire rage,  frustration, anger or
other highly combustive emotions. How do you mediate these discussions or
arguments while facilitating active positive change?

11. What resources exist in your community for furthering the education of
activist youth? What resources do not exist, but would prove useful?

12. Do you know of any examples of youth projects that have inspired your
own activist / parenting / educational goals?

13. Do you have any other thoughts or stories you would like to share about
raising or educating empowered and politically savvy kids?

Thank you for your time and we look forward to reading your answers.

Regards,

Bee Lavender and Anne Elizabeth Moore

That's the problem: slam is a form of expression. Good poetry is not.

thanks for this humor today, mr. bowering. i'm smiling.

    hassen




*ya know, some might argue that a lack of sentiment in art indicates a
stronger emotional element in its creation. i mean, if one suggests that
'good art' eliminates expression/emotion (am i too presumptuous to make the
expression-emotion leap?), the denial (desperation) is obvious since even
the first impulse to draw a line on a stone wall was likely no less than an
existential shriek, right...

October 2003

21: 2003-04 Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry Louise Glück reading her
poems to
open the literary season. Montpelier Room, 6:45 p.m.

22: A Favorite Poem Reading featuring Frank Bidart, Louise Glück, and Robert
Pinsky. Montpelier Room, 6:45 p.m.


November 2003

13: “A Zen Wave”: An Evening of Readings and Discussion; Robert Aitken
reading from his book, A Zen Wave: Basho’s Haiku & Zen. Additional
participants will be announced. Montpelier Room, 6:45 p.m.

20: Frank Bidart and David Gewanter, editors of Collected Poems Of Robert
Lowell, reading and discussing Lowell’s work. Montpelier Room, 6:45 p.m.


Such curatorial decisions by Louise Gluck, with the exception of Robert
Aitken, neglect the numerous (and relatively recent) public appearances in
Wash DC Metro of "The Sons & Daughters of Robert Lowell", and the audience
of perhaps 50 on October 22 for that campy Favorite Poems ad campaign
suggests that these carpetbaggers have outlived their "welcome".  My private
eyes attending the programs on October 21-22 felt that Frank Bidart was
being groomed to succeed Louise Gluck.  If you'd prefer to witness a
different outcome, it wouldn't be that difficult to make your opinion known
to Public Relations or the Poetry Office at "your" Library of Congress
(www.loc.gov).  Or even to your congressional and/or senatorial
representative.  --  Barry Alpert

hi flora:
nb the following observation isn't a reflection of anger, or any
negativity aimed at *you*:  i would seriously question the value of
statements like "there are three versions of poetry" no matter what
the following qualifiers were. whoever is speaking better be REALLY
Really wise. like maybe i'd listen to giorgio agamben, but even so...
with great skepticism.

"Art Forms"

Apparently does many other things, as well. But I do like the noun and verb
coordination for starters. The results of the verb, obviously, can be
critically argued, discussed, amplified, celebrated, dismissed, remembered
and/forgot forever, in multiple contexts, some even remunerative, forever.

I guess to some, it's apparently squeamish that "slam" either as verb or
noun may ever be confused with the hereditary solidity of  "form" as either
a noun or a verb. As in "Slam Forms".

Personally I like contradictions. "Crash poetry" is, I suspect, next up.
Great for collages. Though many will say, that's already happened.
I am willing to be surprised, again.

File Sharing Pits Copyright Against Free Speech
By JOHN SCHWARTZ

Published: November 3, 2003

Forbidden files are circulating on the Internet and threats of lawsuits
are in the air. Music trading? No, it is the growing controversy over
one company's electronic voting systems, and the issues being raised,
some legal scholars say, are as fundamental as the sanctity of elections
and the right to free speech.

Diebold Election Systems, which makes voting machines, is waging legal
war against grass-roots advocates, including dozens of college students,
who are posting on the Internet copies of the company's internal
communications about its electronic voting machines.

The students say that, by trying to spread the word about problems with
the company's software, they are performing a valuable form of
electronic civil disobedience, one that has broad implications for
American society. They also contend that they are protected by fair use
exceptions in copyright law.

Diebold, however, says it is a case of copyright infringement, and has
sent cease-and-desist orders to the students and, in many cases, their
colleges, demanding that the 15,000 e-mail messages and memorandums be
removed from each Web site. "We reserve the right to protect that which
we feel is proprietary," a spokesman for Diebold, David Bear, said.

The files circulating online include thousands of e-mail messages and
memorandums dating to March 2003 from January 1999 that include
discussions of bugs in Diebold's software and warnings that its computer
network are poorly protected against hackers. Diebold has sold more than
33,000 machines, many of which have been used in elections.

Hey, I bow to nobody in my position on the expressivist fallacy -- still,=20
it's not strictly true that good poetry is not a form of expression --=20
given that, among the many definitions of "expression" spread across the=20
pages of my dictionary is "a significant word or phrase." -- I'm sure that=
=20
what most of us object to is the other definition of the expression as an=20
act of representing in a medium, though in current US usage, it's a good=20
thing to be told you were "representing" --

what is bothersome in much slam (as in much printed poetry) is the sense=20
that what we are witnessing is, rather, expressage, "a carrying of parcels=
=20
by express."

aren't we all post-expressionists on this bus?

I loved this Bowering bit, too.  I have been thinking a lot about
politics/poetics etc and am back to the problem of temperament.  I remember a
kid in my neighborhood who used to skin frogs alive and then set them on fire.
He is now in prison for having killed his third wife in an alcoholic rage.
Could his temperament have been changed by a political poem?  -- KO

Interesting. I guess that's part of the problem with these discussions. Everyone's idea of "good poetry" is very different. And we're all sure we're right.

protesting too much, i think.

'good poetry' is pretty rare.

i'll keep my eyes (and ears) open to find it where i can.

tried to get off welbutrin which i took on my own, lexapro as well, the
other twisted molecule from celexa, the last taken after the debacle in
miami. so i stopped the first and went through a couple of sleepless
nights and shakiness., the days were filled with exhaustion, i couldn't
move, my work was an afterthought which kept pouring itself out in spite
of my mind's uneasy clawings. after that i gave up on the lexapro as well,
cold turkey, and then the shakes began, something that shouldn't have
happened after this drug, which has me in its unholy grasp. i found anger
welling up, rising to the surface, my existence a pure fury against my
situation and all that it entailed. the fury led me to push everyone
around me to the limits, there was no going back, nothing from the path
bringing the wonder of despair home again. i began to get dizzy, and
dizziness took hold of me, i'd stop in the middle of the sidewalk losing
consciousness, holding on to azure as if my life depended on it, which it
did. i couldn't work or worked rather in a trance and the production, more
distant than ever, continued as i found myself more and more sexually
aroused, stripping everything bare between us, my consciousness the first
to go. i was shattered, i'd go to sleep around ten, only to wake for hours
in the middle of the night, as now, when my hormonal rhythms are still
screaming and stressed out muscles tense to the breaking point. i was
never awake and never asleep, i could barely keep myself upright with
these spells or swoons as i began to think of them, a latter-day
neurasthenia haunting me as the world swayed and rippled. azure was going
through other trials and tribulations, i found i couldn't help her, both
of us swimming to the bottom of the airless grotto, gasping for breath,
screamed drowned in the screams of others. down there i meandered, my fury
reaching new heights, terrifying me, an enormous depression past despair
waiting at the suicidal door. for once it wasn't easy to lie within the
old familiar feelings of the down world, new gates and portals were giving
way exposing raw skin, nerves, unknown tissues for unknown purposes, each
of them blistered in the salt, some dull monster emerging. i gave up,
reached for the pill, the ultimate stage of the addict, after four or five
days of this, living off the chemistry once again. one wasn't enough, a
second that night, the promise and premise of a third, a fourth, the
continuity of a functioning mind not quite my own, the turn towards a
different kind of somnolence, all questions turned problematic with
dulled belief in the possibilities of answers, answers linked in ragged
nets to questions in the salt air above the ocean of truth precisely
because of its lack of limitations. now i'm a re-covering addict, the
addiction to lexapro forming the hunger in my mind, the welbutrin long
lost and unmissed, expose of another chemical landscape. i couldn't manage
both, i recognize the stress and most likely shortened arc of the madness
of my life, i continue exhaling the language of description, the paste
over the substance of the real, the substrate over the substance. a little
while ago i was sleeping, something uncanny woke me, and i'm again here,
the dizziness a slight new turn of events, writing this down before it
gets lost like so many other texts expelled from the surface of my mind. i
tend myself, i tend myself constantly, words flourish in spite of the
onslaught of the casualty of the brain. i'm at the tip of the flame, the
bottom of the chasm, salt burns my wounds, soaks the oils from the skin,
fills the pen, makes thoughts rise. i'd rather fight the mind than the
brain, i'd say i'm back, but for how long before some new addiction makes
itself manifest, something keeping me on track and the track a little
longer.

*Michelle Tea*'s second book, Valencia, was selected by the Village
Voice as "One of the Top 25 Books of 2000" and snagged a Lambda Literary
Award for Best Lesbian Fiction. Her recently published memoir The
Chelsea Whistle was one of the San Francisco Chronicle's "Top 100 Books
of 2002" and is presently in the running for a Lambda Award in the
Autobiography slot. She is the co-founder of the notorious all-girl
poetry roadshow Sister Spit, and continues to drag herself and other
brave performers across the United States on grueling performance art
boot camps. Her writings turn up on Nerve.com, in The Stranger,
Girlfriends magazine and other shady places. Born and raised in Chelsea,
Massachusetts, she presently lives in San Francisco with her
transboyfriend.

*Mary Burger* has been enjoying a personal anti-technology revolt,
building a wooden shed and installing a hand-crank letterpress. She also
likes to rearrange furniture, and to watch the garden grow. Her book
Sonny, an American midwestern, is forthcoming from Leon Books. New work
will appear in the upcoming issue of VeRT,
http://www.litvert.com/issue9.html.

*Matthew Iribarne* is the author of Astronauts & Other Stories,

Basement Reading Series a Chronicle ePick in March -- check out Jan
Richman's blurb:

*The Basement Reading Series* (Tue/18)
/Sweatin' to the Posey/
It's well past time for a new literary reading series in the Mission
(Adobe has had a lock on bookish hipsters' hearts for too long) and,
judging by the incredible turnout for the Basement's first couple of
events, the literature-loving 94114 demographic agrees with me. The
Basement Reading Series, started up by local upstart Jenny Bitner,
writer and editor of To-Do List magazine, meets monthly in a sultry,
still-sweat-fragrant Bikram Yoga studio at 20th and Mission. Bitner is
an excellent hunter and gatherer; she knows some of the finest young
poets and writers around these parts, spanning the literary spectrum
from "experimental writing to gritty naturalism to post-magical
realism." Next Tuesday night, poet James Hoch ("A Parade of Hands") will
read with poet Glori Simmons ("Graft"), and Bitner herself will unveil a
new short story. -- Jan Richman, special to SF Gate

George, George, George, such a load of piffle, and when I think of the
unspeakable things you and Maria did all night with that poor battered
meatloaf. . . . As you well know it never crossed my lips. In fact I was
trying to throw it out the hotel window when you offered it to Pierre
for lunch. That was unkind of you, and they haven't forgotten at the
health department in Winnipeg. I hope all of Pierre's tests were
negative.

Btw someone call the Canadian mounted spelling police. Bowering is
trying to spell "squeamish."

Come one come all -- come on out to Small Press Traffic's Biggest Weekend of
the Year! On Friday, an undoubtedly revelatory reading by ANSELM BERRIGAN &
MARGARET CHRISTAKOS, on Saturday, our NINTH ANNUAL LITERARY SOIREE & AUCTION!
Please forward this and if you need directions please check the map on our
website, http://www.sptraffic.org. Read on for the details -- hope to see you
at one or both!


Small Press Traffic presents

Friday, November 7, 2003 at 7:30 p.m.
Anselm Berrigan & Margaret Christakos

Kevin Killian on Anselm Berrigan's recent collection, Zero Star Hotel (Edge,
2002): "really something different, it gives you the passionate
can't-put-it-down experience of reading a great novel, and technically it's so
assured you don't even notice how he is producing all his effects. The hero of
Zero Star Hotel goes on a mythic quest; the story's told very simply, with
lots of gritty detail and an attention to surfaces and realities. I can't
speak highly enough about Zero Star Hotel but in the words of Paula Abdul,
Anselm, you have raised the bar for all of us, you're my American idol now."
Berrigan's previous works include Integrity & Dramatic Life (Edge, 1999). He
joins us from NYC.

Margaret Christakos' recent collection, Excessive Love Prostheses (Coach
House, 2002) has just been awarded top poetry honors in Canada's 2003 ReLit
awards. R.M. Vaughan says she's "a writer's writer, one of those jealously
guarded things" and that this book "reminds us again and again that what we
call love (oh, and hate, too) is a language -- a curly, sometimes thorny
shorthand of breathing spaces, double takes, blood rushes, musical marks in
the air." Christakos is the former editor of MIX: The Magazine of Artist-Run
Culture; her previous works include Wipe Under A Love (poetry, Mansfield
Press, 2000) and Charisma (fiction, Pedlar Press, 2000). Also a teacher and
mother, she joins us from Toronto.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Can I recommend yet another book of new poetry?  John Sakkis is a student
at the MFA Writing Program at SF State, and they must be teaching them
something right over there=2E  Sakkis (whose name I think is pronounced wi=
th
an accent on the last syllable, like Weldon Kees) has written a book calle=
d
"He, Don Juan, a Translation," which didn=92t sound too promising at first=

light but which I have reread several times over the last few weeks, likin=
g
it more each time=2E  "He Don Juan" is a translation in a peculiar sense, =
it
re-makes the highly colored anthropology of Carlos Castaneda into a serial=

poem in the Spicer tradition=2E  At first it seems coincidence that Castan=
eda
and Spicer were working out of Berkeley at the same time, but as Sakkis
sees it isn't a coincidence exactly, more a form of magic=2E  The poems ar=
e
dated with dates that remind me of the dates of composition of several of
Spicer's major works, from The Holy Grail through Language, and each is
"spoken" by the naif little pleasure-loving chump who, hypnotized by the
sorcerer Don Juan, becomes more and more like him in every way, until thei=
r
languages become interpenetrable and their existences rise into question
like so much marijuana smoke=2E  There are some attractive drawings by
another local, SF artist Matthew Arnone=2E  It's a book about apprenticing=

oneself to a master and the risks that entails, risks emotional, physical,=

financial romantic, pronomial=2E  "We were in the morning=2E  I felt I was=

speaking 'I don't know,' then was saying 'I don't want it now,' he, don
Juan didn't speak=2E  This is when I knew he was going to evade it, that
question, so I was waiting for him to mention it=2E"  There's a lot going =
on
in this work and I need the help of a whole team of field researchers to
help me decipher it=2E  Ha ha, whatever it is that John Sakkis is on, I wa=
nt
some of it=2E  People who are interested in this book can send 5 dollars t=
o
the publisher, Beets & Gasoline Press, 947 Geary Street #5, San Francisco,=

CA, 94109=2E  Tell them KEVIN KILLIAN sent you=2E

This Saturday, November 8, will be the Poets' Plays event at the Bowery
Poetry Club, featuring work by Jordan Davis, Ethan Fugate, Charles Borkhuis,
and myself.

http://www.bowerypoetry.com/
308 BOWERY, JUST NORTH OF HOUSTON
SATURDAY, 4 - 6 PM
$4 admission goes to support the readers

I don't have any info on what the others are doing, but here's the basic
skinny on me:

KINSKI IN KANADA
a radio play

Time: Kelowna, BC
Place: About 2 pm
Scenario: Off a major artery...

Featuring:
Stephanie Sanditz as Christopher
Brian Kim Stefans as Klaus

Directed by: O. Gus Trainbourg

"A moist, sour taste in the mouth. Satisfaction of three square, and evenly
devoured, and easily evacuated, meals. A train station in topical, Frankfurt
light. A costume of impeccable, class-hatred beige. I could lose myself in
that color, that sound, that taste of pretzels and beer. I hadn’t allowed
kitch into my stable of affects. Minhoi, are you listening? And my little
prosciutto, Nastassja? Are you done rising through the mainlining mists of
Vietnam? Will I see you when I close my eyes tonight?"

But don't let that scare you... I think it will be fun.

cheers,
Brian

Has anyone heard this?  Anything to say about it?  Do the players get a
chance to stretch out or are they mostly playing background sounds to
Ginsberg?  Hard to pass up a sarrusophone recording.

Essays

by Pierre Joris

“In Pierre Joris’s prescient collection of essays, the nomadic is

common ground.” -- Charles Bernstein, author My Way: Speeches and Poems


“The days of anything static—form, content, state—are over,” declares
poet and translator Pierre Joris in A Nomad Poetics, his first
collection of critical essays. Joris maps the success and limitations
of contemporary avant-garde poetics, from Tristan Tzara to the most
contemporary American experimental poetry, an investigation that leads
him to envision a “nomadic poetics” as a strategy for new poetic work,
for translation and, fundamentally, for an ethics of early 21st century
life. Extending concepts and concerns voiced by Gilles Deleuze and
Félix Guattari, A Nomad Poetics is a daring first step in deploying the
method of the rhizome, one grounded in Paul Celan’s insight that
“Reality is not. It has to be searched for and won.” With articulate
immediacy, Joris’s essays announce a metamorphosis of language-based
art, much needed if poetry is to be of essential use in shaping the
world to come.


“A Nomad Poetics is a book of sweet syntheses. It moves beautifully
across boundaries of aesthetics and ideology which Joris has
transcended with apparent and generous grace.”—Donald Revell, author of

Subject:      query about publishing
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I'm writing to ask if anyone would be interested in publishing a book of
mine - any book. The last book of my work that appeared (besides .echo
which is only online publish-on-demand) was fifteen years ago, Disorders
of the Real, Station Hill Press. I've had numerous offers since then, and
every one has fallen through. I've had a couple of chapbooks out, one of
which never made it to the public. I would love to have a work that could
actually appear with an isbn number in a bookstore.

Almost all of my writing is online which doesn't preclude print in the
slightest; when my work has appeared in anthologies, it looks fine. And I
do my best (through anthologies I've edited, poetry/media series I've
helped run etc.) to support the writing community myself.

One book fifteen years ago, before my net writing or codework, seems
relatively meagre. If you're interested, you can have whatever profits
there might be (of course none), and my gratitude for your support. Please
write me back-channel; I'm embarrassed enough to inquire here.

Don't listen to me.


I honestly believe the only truths that exist are discovered by people
between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four. After that it's downhill,
gone forever, all that teen energy lost in the fabrication of real-life
institutions harboring one forever. The adult world destroys insight,
theorizes endlessly, corrects and creates imagined wrongs, produces
hatreds and bureaucracies, rites and religions. Romeo and Juliet should
never have lived into adulthood; they are the first and last philosophers.
We learn later on in life to disseminate, dissimulate, hem and haw, build
up layers of scar tissue covering our mistakes, as I've said before, we're
carved into the semblance of a human being. But the carving is monstrous,
the thickness of the tissue - which isn't layered as many popularly
believe - is cancerous and filled with harbingers of future death. There's
no space for breathing, none for proper motion, we take medication only to
prolong our misery. The follies of youth are the birth of the world, rock
and rap head-bang the difficult meanderings of latter-day classical
composers honored for their ripe old age. Contradiction comes only later
in life; we're all born into clarity. Trust no one but yourself, preen,
move hard against and into the world, write forever. We take your
literature, call it stereotyped, sentimental, typical, mean, and turn it
into illegible stylings of problematic language, questions that only
answer themselves in the ugly dawn of old age. Hormonal fury drives all of
us; the rest is substance, paste, obsequiously crawling from one religion
or theory to another, desperately hanging on to the presumed final word,
or else talking about the journey of life, which should have ended long
ago. The elders lure the young into war and other disasters, while
decrying gangs which threaten their own territory. Revolution and eternal
questioning are the only truths, beaten out of the world, or forgotten, as
one hurtles towards the fourth decade of life. Kill the messenger in
yourselves; there's nothing more to deliver, not even at warp speed. The
internet brings the same old thing; it's already past its prime. Gather
elsewhere, go.

Microsoft Offers Reward to Stop Viruses
Wednesday November 5, 12:43 pm ET
By Ted Bridis, AP Technology Writer
Microsoft Announces Creation of $5 Million Reward
Program to Fight Illegal Computer Viruses


WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. announced Wednesday
it is creating a $5 million reward program to help law
enforcement identify and convict those who illegally
release worms, viruses and other types of malicious
programs on the Internet.
Microsoft said the first two rewards it will offer
will be for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of those responsible for the spread of the
MSBlast.A worm and the SoBig virus unleashed earlier
this year.

The company offered $250,000 rewards for each.

Those two malicious programs attacked computers that
ran Microsoft's Windows operating system and caused
widespread problems for companies and home users
earlier this year.

Microsoft executives made the announcement, flanked by
representatives of the FBI, Secret Service and
Interpol international police agency. Residents of any
country are eligible for the rewards, officials said.

"The malicious distribution of worms and viruses ...
are far from victimless crimes," said Keith Lourdeau,
acting deputy assistant director of the FBI Cyber
Division. He noted that Internet attacks have cost
businesses and home users millions of dollars, with
some estimates putting it into the billions.

Microsoft's software has been the target of the most
serious Internet attacks over the last two years, and
company founder Bill Gates has announced a
"trustworthy computing" initiative to focus on
improving the security of all of Microsoft's products.

Also, Interpol, an international law enforcement
organization, will play a critical role in the program
by helping the world's police forces to share
information.

The role of Interpol is particularly important because
the Microsoft initiative is a global one -- a
cybercrime that endangers national infrastructure and
individuals worldwide.

"Interpol is particularly interested in fighting the
malicious spreading of viruses because this represents
truly borderless crime that requires a truly global
response, a global collaboration between police and
private industry," said a statement by Interpol
Secretary General Ronald K. Noble in Lyon, France.

"This Microsoft reward program is an opportunity to
continue building effective relationships between the
world's police and the private sector in order to
prevent and prosecute cybercrime," it said.

"While some might consider certain cybercrime offenses
to be little more than mischief, they actually
threaten the physical security of all of those who
rely on technology in their lives," said Peter Nevitt,
Interpol's Director of Information Systems and
Technology.

It was pointed out to me that the message below had a typo and poor grammar,
so here it is again.

As you all know, the e-mail Send button is too easy to click, unlike mailing
a letter. And we're eager, too eager, to send the letter and get on to other
things, at least I am, even before checking for mistakes. And then, like
pornography these poorly-written posts, these oversights, circulate in
cyberspace forever. This from someone to whom rewriting is part of his
aesthetic, against the myth of "spontaneous prose."

Reminds me that I gave Glück's last book a poor review because she was still
moaning about her mother, and I felt is was time she grew up. However,
technically I think she's a terrific poet.

Matt Gonzales of the Green Party is in the run-off for Mayor in San
Francisco. If he wins the job - the runoff against Gavin Newsom - Matt will
probably be the first Mayor in the entire world who reads Lorine Niedecker.

Now that's "green," real green.

Not true!  At the Niedecker conference in Wisconsin, the mayor of Milwaukee,
in the course of declaring "Lorine Niedecker Day," read us a poem from New
Goose:

Motor cars
            like china
sometimes chink each other.

Will the speeding sugar bowl
            of taffy color
stop to eat people?

(More on that excellent conference when I get time to write up my notes...)

Hello all:

Go to http://www.litvert.com/cubreportoaklandnewbrutal.html
for a compelling take on the history of the "New Brutalism" by Oakland
writer Stephanie Young. She hits very near the mark, and her essay is a
joy to read! (though there are a few assertions with which I take
issue...!)

The book she discusses in the article, "Involuntary Vision," is just
out from Avenue B (one can find it at SPD, Amazon, Avenue B via
Duration Press, and of course through me (for a sizeable discount!!)).
This volume is an anthology of writing about Akira Kurosawa's
film "Dreams." "Involuntary Vision" features new poems by Ryan
Bartlett, Trevor Calvert, Tanya Brolaski, Cynthia Sailers, Eli Drabman,
Elizabeth Willis, Stephen Ratcliffe, James Meetze, Geoffrey Dyer, and
Julia Bloch--all writers that should (and surely will!) be household
names! It is a great little anthology, especially for fans of Kurosawa,
so don't miss it! Also, it looks BEAU-TI-FUL (so it will make an
excellent addition to your bookshelf!!).

Miss you like crazy
Michael Cross

I must confess that I did have a hand in this one, having
done the poetry editing and much of the design for HSR.
Hints, tips, encomia, raspberries, all cheerfully accepted.

Whatta gaffe! My green (with whatever) apologies! Tho looking closely at the
poem,  in no way in this City - which different folks also claim with as
much geo-legitimacy as any Euro Am "other"  as either/or both Northern
Mexico and East China-  the interpretively ambidextrous verb in the poem
would be read at great risk by any candidate for Mayor of San Francisco!

But then, maybe, cosmopolitan limits or certain ethno blinders need to be
taken into consideration (are they?) when reading Niedecker. (??)

It will be nice to get the Conference report - I am sure a mammoth job for
anyone making a real attempt. Are the papers being assembled into a book?

Subject:      NPR Given Record Donation
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Since I flipped on the TV today to watch Today this morning, only to find
out that the most newsworthy event was Rosie O'Donnell having berated a
staffer, I am especially happy about this donation.  I say the eloquent
rhetors (right, left and center) of the Poetics list should all write and
ask that NPR cover the arts as they happen in America, and not simply
just what tickles the fancy of the middle mind.

NPR Given Record Donation
Thu Nov 6, 7:42 AM ET


By Paul Farhi and Reilly Capps, Washington Post Staff Writers

National Public Radio will announce today the largest donation in its
history, a cash bequest from the will of the late philanthropist Joan Kroc
of about $200 million.


The bequest from the widow of the founder of the McDonald's fast-food
chain both shocked and delighted people at NPR's headquarters in
Washington yesterday. It amounts to almost twice NPR's annual operating
budget. "No one saw this coming," said one person.


The nonprofit organization, which will disclose details of the bequest at
a news conference this afternoon, called the donation the "largest
monetary gift ever received by an American cultural institution" in a
brief announcement to its staff yesterday.


The gift was such a surprise to NPR officials that they were uncertain
what the money would be used for. The organization's board is expected to
meet in the next few weeks to decide what to do with the windfall. An NPR
spokesperson declined to comment yesterday.


NPR, best known for its daily news programs "Morning Edition" and "All
Things Considered," cut back on some of its music and cultural programs
earlier this year, and there was speculation yesterday that Kroc's money
could be used to restore those offerings. It could also be used to expand
NPR's news programs, which are heard by about 22 million people weekly.


Speaking generally, Michele Norris, a co-host of "All Things Considered,"
said any cash infusion is welcome at an organization that is perpetually
on tight budgets. "What we do every day is a miracle on the order of
loaves and fishes with such a small and dedicated staff," Norris said.


Kroc, 75, died of brain cancer on Oct. 12 in San Diego. She had been a
longtime listener of NPR's local affiliate, KPBS, but had no formal
association with NPR or history of funding it. People at NPR said
yesterday that she had expressed admiration for NPR's coverage of the
events leading up to the war in Iraq (news - web sites) and its reporting
of the war itself.


Her gift to NPR is one of several that flowed from her estate. Last week
the University of San Diego and the University of Notre Dame announced
they each had been given $50 million by Kroc's estate. The donations are
the largest either university has ever received.


In 1998 she gave $25 million to USD for the establishment of the Joan B.
Kroc Institute for Peace & Justice. Notre Dame hosts a similar
institution, the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies,
which was established in 1986.


With a long history of philanthropy, Kroc has donated to individual public
radio stations in the past. In 2001 she gave $3 million to KPBS to help
the station build a new studio. KPBS spokeswoman Nancy Worlie said that
her station also would announce a gift today. She would not confirm that
the gift came from Kroc, who lived much of her life in Rancho Santa Fe,
near San Diego.


Forbes magazine estimated Kroc's worth at $1.7 billion and ranked her No.
121 on its list of the nation's wealthiest people.


Joan Beverly Mansfield was born in 1928, the daughter of a railroad man
who was often out of work during the Depression. Still, he made sure his
daughter received piano lessons, and eventually she became a piano player
in a St. Paul restaurant. She met Ray Kroc in 1957 when he was dining, on
business, and caught her eye. In his autobiography he called her a "blonde
beauty." Though she was 25 years younger, the two fell in love and
eventually married. The couple had a daughter, Linda Kliber, who could not
be reached for comment yesterday.


When Ray Kroc died in 1984, she took control of the San Diego Padres,
which her husband had purchased 10 years earlier. And though Ray Kroc had
been committed to philanthropy, opening the Kroc Foundation in Chicago to
support medical research, his wife took giving even more seriously.


She gave more than $90 million to the Salvation Army, the largest donation
that organization had ever received, to build a 12-acre community center
that opened in June 2002. She also helped build the St. Vincent de Paul
Joan Kroc Center for the homeless, a palliative care center, and the
Kroc-Copley Animal Shelter, all in or near San Diego. She was also a major
benefactor of the Carter Center of Emory University in Atlanta, and in
1987 she gave $1 million to the Democratic National Committee (news - web
sites), at the time believed to be the largest single contribution to a
political party in U.S. history.


During its most recent fiscal year, which ended in September, NPR had an
operating budget of $103 million and broke even despite the cost of
covering the war in Iraq. Despite gains in listeners, its income has grown
slowly over the past three years. In fiscal 2001, NPR lost about $4
million.


About half of NPR's revenue comes from public radio stations that pay
annual dues based on the size of their audience. The balance comes
primarily from private donations and corporate contributions. The
organization receives less than 1 percent of its funding directly from
federal tax dollars. The federal Corporation for Public Broadcasting
supplies about 15 percent of the budgets of NPR's member stations,
however, which then pay some of that money to NPR.

It would be fun to have the major candidates for all offices sit down and do a
test in contemporary poetry.  Passing it might not mean that we'd have a good
mayor or president, but it would be fun to see the scores.

A test of broad overall knowledge would be good.  Most civil service people have
to take tests.  Postal workers do.  Why not presidents?  We could give them an
empty globe, for instance, and have them fill in nations, and any geographical
elements of which they are aware (rivers, deserts, forests, mountains, etc.).

It would be amusing to have the published results.

What other questions would we like to have asked?

Subject:      Perspectives on Evil Ejournal - Issue 3
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

(from Salwa Ghaly)


Perspectives on Evil and Human Wickedness  (PEHW) is
pleased to announce that Issue 3 of this ejournal is
now accessible at http://www.wickedness.net/ejv1n3.htm


With Alan Sondheim on its editorial board, the journal
has been able to expand and develop its art section
with which the present issue begins.  We are also
looking forward to introducing a section on Genocide
and another on Practical Approaches to evil, both of
which should buttress and maintain the
interdisciplinary and creative character of this
publication.  Feedback on this issue and past ones is
welcome, and will be published in the section
earmarked for readers' comments.

Short description of PEHW and information on the
upcoming issue:
ISSN: 1471-5597
Volume 4. : Winter 2004  (themed issue:
Reconciliation and Forgiveness)
Submissions (along with a biographical blurb) are due
on December 15, 2003

Perspectives on Evil and Human Wickedness publishes
scholarly work, personal reflections and
practitioners' accounts relating to classifying,
defining, and probing different aspects of evil. It
aims to shed light on the genesis and manifestations
of evil as well as on the diverse angles from which
humans can understand, tackle, surmount, or come to
terms with it. Perspectives on Evil and Human
Wickedness does not espouse any ideological viewpoint
or favor any specific theoretical framework, but
interrogates a plurality of perspectives aimed at
advancing research on this topic.

Information on submissions and stylesheet is available
at the website.

Issue 4.  Winter 2004:
Submissions are sought for the Winter volume to be
devoted entirely to the theme of Reconciliation and
Forgiveness. The volume hopes to present a panoply of
possible angles from which to engage this topic.  A
wide array of relevant theoretical, critical and
professional perspectives is, therefore, encouraged.
Of most interest will be contributions that add to,
alter and/or deepen, our current understanding of this
theme.

Submissions on how reconciliation and forgiveness are
viewed by law, ethics, philosophy, psychology,
literature and other relevant disciplines and
professions are of special interest.  How do
individuals, groups and societies in our globalized
world attempt to surmount trauma and initiate the
intricate process(es) of forgiveness and
reconciliation? What hampers or aids such processes?
How does art foreground issues related to
reconciliation and forgiveness? Below is a
list of suggested topics:

--The forgivable and the unforgivable
  The misrecognitions
  The incommensurate
  The irreconcilable

--Narrativizing forgiveness

--Trauma, physical and psychological
  Memorializing traumatic past
  How subjecthood is conceived vis-a-vis trauma
  Gendered approaches to trauma
  Levinas, Michel de Certeau, Derrida (and others) on
forgiveness & Body trauma
  Approaches to healing

--Holocaust Studies

--Refugee studies

--Transitional justice and regime change/conflict
resolution

--Forgiveness and Criminal law
  Restorative and retributive justice
  Legal/ethical/political approaches to General
(blanket) Amnesty (for people who have committed
atrocities during wars/civil wars).

--Conflict Resolution and reconciliation
  Cross-cultural perspectives
  Historical perspectives
  The ethics of military/political intervention in
local communities
  The role of NGOs in conflict resolution
  The role of the international community in
furthering forgiveness/reconciliation

--Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (track record,
successes and failures)

--Reconciliation and Forgiveness in literature
(Shakespeare's Romances,  postcolonial texts, women's
literature, etc.)

--Divorce and remarriage

--Case Studies (on any aspect of the above)

Contributions are solicited in the form of articles
(under 6000 words), dialogues, creative pieces, book
and media reviews and personal reflections. Feedback
and responses on material published by the journal
are also sought. Submissions in Word, WordPerfect, PD.
or RTF formats are recommended; please see the 'Author
Notes' section of the website for further details.
Contributors are urged to avoid unnecessary jargon
and to make their work accessible and intelligible to
non-specialists. A brief biographical paragraph should
accompany each submission.

For further details and information, please visit the
journal website at: http://www.wickedness.net/ej.htm
or contact Rob Fisher at theodicist@wickedness.net or

 "nineteenth-century British poetry" in broad terms, as should those working
 on later Victorians....we're hoping to move that November 15 deadline back
 by a couple weeks, but the Gordian knot of red tape has yet to be cut.

Hi everyone, if any of you are coming tonight to see Small Press
Traffic's reading with Margaret Christakos and Anselm Berrigan, just
come a little bit early and take a look at the Graduate Gallery,
where the students of CCAC are re-doing Ian Wallace's epochal
"Magazine Piece" from 1974.  It's for one night only and tonight's
the night.  (This will be our first chance in San Francisco to see
anything Brian Jungen's done.)  (And it will be enormous fun too by
the way so take a minute and come on up.)

PLAY SPACE
Paullette Long and Shepard Pollock  Art Community Experiment
CCA  Graduate  Gallery
1111 8th St
San Francisco, California
(2nd flr, right from security and up the stairs, above the cafe)

Ian Wallace
Magazine Piece
With magazines selected by Dodie Bellamy, Tammy Rae Carland, Hannah
Collins, Dennis Cooper, Jack Hanley, Brian Jungen, and Kevin Killian

OPENING Fri, Nov 7, 5-9pm ONLY!!!

This special event will inaugurate the activities at Play Space.
Vancouver artist Ian Wallace first created his conceptual work
Magazine Piece=92 in 1974. For this exhibition we have invited 8 left
coast artists, writers and the like to chose a magazine that we can
produce 8 versions of Wallace's work at Play Space. Known as the
father of the Vancouver School, this work demonstrates the historical
shift of these artists from highly conceptual works to their better
known photo-based practice. This exhibition has been made possible by
the generous support and direction of the artist and the individual
participants.

============================================

In Conversation With Political Authors
Sponsored by salon.com
Thursday, December 4, 6:00 PM, Twist Restaurant, 495 10th Street,
Oakland

Corporate abuse of power and politics, deregulation, the Patriot Act,
Iraq,
Iran, Afghanistan, the Florida-tion of the 2004 Election, power
companies
ravaging California,
and the black-out of real news in America, are all on the agenda of In
Conversation With Political Authors. This no-holds barred discussion of
politics as
usual in America will take place on Thursday, December 4th at 6:00 PM at
Washington Inn's Twist Restaurant, 495 10th Street in downtown Oakland,
CA.  In
Conversation With Political Authors is a sit-down dinner where audience
members
are invited to eat and mingle with the speakers at $35.00 a plate.  For
those
wishing to only attend the program discussion, it begins at 7:00 PM, and
a $10
donation is requested at the door.

Journalist and investigative reporter Norman Solomon will moderate this
panel
composed of authors Ishmael Reed, Iris Chang, Daniel Ellsberg, and Dori
Maynard.  Authors Floyd Salas and Gerald Nicosia will provide the
opening and
closing statements. The event is sponsored by Salon.com and PEN Oakland.
 For
tickets, please call (510) 525-3948 or visit <A HREF="http://www.penoakland.org">
www.penoakland.org</A>.

Norman Solomon is the executive director of the Institute for Public
Accuracy, a nationwide consortium of public-policy researchers. He is
the author of
"Media Beat," a nationally syndicated column on media and politics. A
longtime
associate of FAIR, he has written op-ed articles on media issues for
many
papers, including the Boston Globe, Washington Post, Newsday, New York
Times, Miami
Herald, Los Angeles Times, USA
Today and Baltimore Sun.

Utne Reader called Solomon one of "the fiercest and most articulate
media
critics around." A Los Angeles Times reviewer wrote: "The bold,
muckraking tone
of these columns offers a welcome respite from the decerebrated
discourse that
too often passes for contemporary journalism."

Panelist Ishmael has been described as one of today's pre-eminent
African American literary figures--perhaps the most widely reviewed
since
Ralph Ellison, and, along with Samuel Delany and Amiri Baraka, probably
the most
controversial. No other contemporary black writer, male or female, has
used
the language and beliefs of folk culture so imaginatively, and few have
been so
stinging about the absurdity of
American racism.

Ishmael Reed's latest offerings include: Blues City:  A Walk in Oakland,
which takes its audience on a tour of Oakland, exploring its fascinating
history.
In From Totems to Hip-Hop: A Multicultural Anthology of Poetry Across
the
Americas, 1900-2002, Ishmael Reed pushes the boundaries in a truly
all-inclusive
multicultural anthology. Booklist states, "This important collection
synthesizes and presents broad swaths of work from poets of all races
and backgrounds,
as only
Reed can, ranging from Gertrude Stein to Ai, from Bessie Smith to Askia
Toure, from W. C. Handy to the little-known poetry of Ernest Hemingway."
In Another
Day at the Front: Dispatches from the Race War, Reed offers original and
revamped politically charged essays aimed at the perpetrators of
America's war on
blacks.

In 1971, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told President Nixon that,
"Daniel Ellsberg is the most dangerous man in America. He must be
stopped at all
costs." Daniel Ellsberg,  2003 American Book Award winner for SECRETS: A
Memoir
of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers, brings to the panel a knowledge of
the
dangers of working with a corrupt administration, and opens up a
discussion on the
parallels between this government's War on Iraq, and the Vietnam War.
Ellsberg's work is especially timely as new details about the Bush
Administration's
controversial decision to go to war in Iraq make headlines. With the
spate of
recent scandals that have rocked institutions ranging from the Catholic
church
to the corporate boardroom, as well as the ongoing conflicts in the
Middle
East, this warning could not be more timely or relevant.

Panelist Dori Maynard, the daughter of the late Bob Maynard, the first
African American to own a major metropolitan newspaper, will discuss
issues of race,
gender, class, and the 2004 presidential election. Dori Maynard is
president
of the Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education. She also
directed
the institute's History Project
and co-authored "Letters to My Children," which is a compilation of
nationally syndicated columns by her late father Bob Maynard.

Panelist Iris Chang, the author of Thread of the Silkworm and the New
York
Times bestselling The Rape of Nanking, is the recipient of the MacArthur
Foundation's Program on Peace and International Cooperation Award and
the Woman of
the Year Award from the Organization of Chinese Americans. In 2001,
Stephen
Ambrose told the Fort Worth Star Telegram that Iris Chang "may be the
best young
historian we've got, because she understands that to communicate
history,
you've got to tell the story in an interesting way. She uses those vital
storytelling rhythms." Chang's latest book The Chinese in America looks
at the struggle
for civil liberties of Chinese in America. This is an all too familiar
refrain
to virtually all the ethnic groups who have settled in this
country over the centuries. This struggle for rights is being witnessed
today
as many Muslims, and Americans of Middle-Eastern descent find themselves
questioned and looked on with suspicion since the 9/11 terrorist attack.

The evening will begin with opening statements by PEN President Floyd
Salas,
and end with closing statements by author Gerald Nicosia. Salas is an
award-winning and critically-acclaimed author of six books, including
the novels T
attoo the Wicked Cross, State
of Emergency, the memoir Buffalo Nickel, and a book of poetry, Color of
My
Living Heart. Salas is the recipient of National Endowment for the Arts,
California Arts Council, Eugene F. Saxton, Rockefeller Foundation,
Joseph Henry
Jackson, and other fellowships and awards.

Nicosia is a freelance journalist, interviewer, and literary critic with
over
twenty years of experience, contributing to hundreds of publications,
including the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles
Times, the San
Francisco Chronicle, USA Today, the American Book Review, the Review of
Contemporary Fiction, Contemporary Literary
Criticism, and the New York Quarterly. For the past fifteen years,
Nicosia
has worked with Vietnam veterans, studying, documenting, and aiding in
their
recovery from the war. Having interviewed over 600 veterans and doctors,
he
completed a massive book called Home to War: A History of the Vietnam
Veterans
Movement, which was published by Crown/Random House in 2001.

Subject:      Bush Sr./ Remark on Occupying Iraq
Comments: To: UK POETRY <UKPOETRY@LISTSERV.MUOHIO.EDU>
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

In his memoirs, "A World Transformed," written five years ago, George
Bush, Senior, wrote the following to explain why he didn't go after
Saddam Hussein at the end of the Gulf War.

"Trying to eliminate Saddam...would have incurred incalculable human and
political costs. Apprehending him was probably impossible....

We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule
Iraq.... there was no viable "exit strategy" we could see, violating
another of our principles.

Furthermore, we had been self-consciously trying to set a pattern for
handling aggression in the post-Cold War world.

Going in and occupying Iraq, thus unilaterally exceeding the United
Nations' mandate, would have destroyed the precedent of international
response to aggression that we hoped to establish. Had we gone the
invasion route, the United States could conceivably still be an
occupying power in a bitterly hostile land."

Victoria N. Alexander
author of Naked Singularity

Tuesday, November 18, 6 p.m.
The Unitarian Church of all Souls
Lexington Avenue @ 80th Street
New York City

"A painful tale [about euthanasia]. The emotions are raw at times, but there
's a cool tone of postmodern post-mortem throughout as well, raising hackles
and sympathy from first to last."--Kirkus Reviews

"Alexander takes on a gut-wrenching topic in this ambitious second novel...
[she] writes eloquently about the family's daily emotional pain... [and] the
lurid, macabre ending [is] a climax that seems barely
believable." --Publishers Weekly

derelicts darken everywhere, costumed Medusa,
volcanoes that were death for hillsides to imagine
the sun flutters in your curled paws
                         - a crash of craft -

a paragraph halved at the hinges, with a scootch of art
nations cough out a drizzle of the nearly-human
their thrones freckled with Calibans
                         - shy as a riddle -

their lips bend childhood down a lichened course
weightless as rot, puzzling as a parchment blip
and as anachronistic, plus "and as"
                         - a moon-stiff stain -

enough of this silk compass talk, thank-voiced mutts!

bran muffins, there is nothing silenter
than my disappeared cooks
I'm amazed from the hips all around
the cooks' slight belongings burst
        {it's all simply morning}
their eyelids guessed at my forehead
suddenly their flat faces cried out
              "we're round"
        {it's all simply morning}
     "spilled coins know the floor,
        yea and the floor hath
      NO DOUBT of its visitants"
the cooks were courteous as diamonds
and most often mixed up triangle freezes
I'm amazed from the hips all around, there's
nothing silenter than my disappeared cooks

red rum & she was murdered. please peals
leaps pales:  sleep peels.

she'll shell: halls shall fail, waver: of
woven vows. "she vowed."

this momentum..

now i'll translate to make sense. in the middle
of an evening depression, which felt 'even.'

murder reverses the drinking of dark rum. etiquette
fales, perseveres, fades in transcendence. sleep awakens.

she'll work with machines, not in viking halls which already
disappear like so many ghosts. promises are woven in speech.

inertia drives the sounds, forcing them into words
and the semblance of meaning..

SUE LANDERS & CHRISTOPHER MATTISON READING AT CASPER JONES


PLEASE COME!

TUESDAY NOVEMBER 18, 7:00 PM


(see below for details)


SUE LANDERS is the author of 248 mgs., a panic picnic (O Books,
2003)

This book explores the emotional and socio-political lives of a cast of
characters based on autobiography, but devised by sound. Some characters
are the same character under different names. The book's claustrophobic
tercets combined with spiraling repetition help foreground the importance
of artifice and code, the very elements the book's characters undermine,
complicate, and expose. The code is a score. To sound out the story.

"This is a daring and contemporary voice that speaks of pills, guns, and
of shame. The story is captivating, the echoes of recurring themes and
stanzas are haunting: this book is a blast"--Anne Tardos.

She is also is co-editor of the magazine Pom2. She lives in Brooklyn.


CHRISTOPHER MATTISON hails from Boston where he is the co-editor of
ADVENTURES IN POETRY (with Larry Fagin). OTHER PUBLICATIONS & PORTABLE PRESS
at YO-YO LABS published, for this occasion his debut chapbook:

STATICTICIANS

off-set printed cover in blue ink on goldenrod yellow paper, edition of 100

An ardent, lucid account of the hill luminaria and multiple secular
close-ups--their intimacies. Tendencies, tugs. Christopher's work is
perfectly clear, just so vivid.

"What's loosed along rookeries?/basalt aspiring to cobble/capons to
dirigibles"


ALSO: POSSIBLE LEONIE WILSON / ALAN SONDHEIM house band
(tenor guitar and trumpet)


Casper Jones House Cafe Bar Lounge

440 Bergen Street
between 5th Ave. & Flatbush Ave.
Park Slope, Brooklyn
(718) 399-8741
take the Q train to 7th Ave or the 2/3 train to Bergen Street

*GAS `reg' section*
*GAS `expr' section*

I've been thinking about two books that fascinate me -

kari edwards, iduna, O Books, 2003
Nada Gordon & Gary Sullivan, Swoon, Granary, 2001

initial notes on the pda -

the two books - fieles within the virtual as well as delineations of
desire
intimacies formied by protocols within swoon first
in depth presence of digital community

the emotional flooding at the gates

kari in the midst of sea of concept and turmoil

ik k words graphically at crosspurposes

in g and s emotional flux

both Boons

bring daniesl raster - lebbeus woords - inti plau

Now onto it. Both books connect with virtual semantics; kari's overlays
are multitasking readwrites and interspersions; the references are rarely
to online per se; but underlie everything written; "'I have sex with open
impact cryptic numbers at play- / grounds, screaming out;'" [...]
"artificial arms and digital fault lines"  - the fault line between
faultline -

While writing this the connection stuttering more than usual, quite more,
I can't readwrite what I say -

In Swoon, the huge and mur-key communication protocols modes portend the
bodies of the initiates to the extent that embarrassment ensues across the
modalities.

I wanted to mention David Daniels - all three of the works have underlying
rasters.

Swoon might be the most important poetics work written at the hinge of the
millennium; emotion fluxes through the filters of communicative
strategies. There are numerous works dealing with online persona,
psychology, psychoanalysis; there are almost none in which the culture
manifests itself without description. Dibbell comes to mind slightly,
almost evanescent, but that's a story within a MOO; Swoon's narrative is
broken and open-ended.

The two of them fiercely query each other, there are moments quite clearly
written for eternity & the conceivable tablet, there are others that slip
out often in despair or old relationships fissure/ reinscribe themselves.

There is absolutely nothing like this except and to a paler extent what
millions are doing online right now or wish they were doing without such
ability to reflect or cohere.

kari's work is more reflective, almost the non-intimacy of language
gridding or obfuscations such as you might find in Dom Sylvester Houedard,
but this is all arranged, arrayed. iduna writes through itself; unlike
Swoon, there's no possibility of resolution, and the words chunk
themselves through in a manner similar to the border language surrounding
page centers which resounds early Clark Coolidge but more relevant, the
languaging occurring through online writing and interferences sidetracking
and tending elsewhere.

David Daniels - look up the work online - you will find language gridding
carefully assembled through digital wording in yet another fashion -
someone on television tonight used the Etch-a-Sketch for sportsplayer
delineations - this is - this work is - simply brilliant, Daniels an
original biography and portraiture, you must locate it.

How to locate these through bookfinder, amazon, google, abe, depending on
the publication degree and appearance.

I see all of these works as harbingers of new semantics troubling the
horizon, more than, say, the generative poetics or poetry which often
reproduces what has already been accomplished in the static sphere.

A book I do want to mention with no relation to what has gone before -

Danna Scott's Boxing, The Complete Guide to Training and Fitness. I know
Dana and her techniques are brilliant. From the back cover: "A licensed
amateur and professional cornerperson who has been training amateur
fighters for several years, she has worked in various boxing venues
throughout the country including Madison Square Garden and has been
featured on Lifetime Television and MSG sports." If you want to
proactively learn about boxing, this book is it.

Still reading the official blender gamekit by Roosendaal and Wartmann, and
strongly recommend this. As I mentioned before, it comes with ten games
you can take apart, reassemble, etc. I've been using bits and pieces.

The Vimalakirti Sutra, translated as The Holy Teaching of Vimalakirti, by
Robert A.F. Thurman. But is it holy? How does this term operate in
Buddhism?

And still with British romanticism, The Lake District, an anthology by
Norman Nicholson, and The Grasmere Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth, edited
by Pamela Woof. The latter's much more interesting than William's work,
and the latter ties in psychogeography.

Anyway - perhaps sketching out a field here? which would be that of the
structured body, the protocoled body whose expressive and somatic domain
involves semantics filtered by the virtual.

I could go on; I've been thinking about this as intensely as I can. The
boxing, Sutra, Words-worthy, are distractions. The farther afield...

"To create a fake user for an action, press SHIFT-F4."

I've failed you ...

Correction

A headline last Sunday rendered a quotation
from President Bush incorrectly. As the article
reported, the president said, "I'll say that the
world is more peaceful and more free under
my leadership, and America is more secure"
(not "more free and more peaceful").

Sidereality (http://www.sidereality.com/) is great for reviews, and also
Constant Critic (http://www.constantcritic.com/).

Verse Daily (http://www.versedaily.com/) and Poetry Daily
(http://poems.com/) note all titles received and also consider excerpts.
Tons of visitors--submit with permission to excerpt. I think their

this hanging thing spiders you

its patchwork disappearing your face, but

I saw the coffins at Clark AFB in 1965 before we had a war

I met a guardsman last week suffering from 'battle fatigue'

war does have real consequences the Washington cowboys would rather we
didn't see.

> What World War I's Greatest Poet Would Say About Hiding Our War Dead
>
> By ADAM COHEN
>
> Published: November 9, 2003
>
> When World War I broke out, the English saw going off to battle as a fine
> thing to do. They embraced the Latin poet Horace's dictum, "Dulce et
> decorum est, pro patria mori" - It is sweet and proper to die for one's
> country. But four years later, that romantic notion had been shattered by
> the grim reality of the mustard-gas-laced killing fields, and by the
bitter
> words of Wilfred Owen, a British officer now recognized as the greatest
> poet of the Great War. Owen reported from the battlefields of France that,
> contrary to the prettified accounts being served up, the war he witnessed
> was full of blood "gargling" up from "froth-corrupted lungs" and "vile,
> incurable sores on innocent tongues."
>
> Owen's subject was, he declared, "war, and the pity of war." He expressed
> it through dark word portraits, in which dead and dying young men were
> stripped of any glory or sentimentality. Owen himself became one of these
> inglorious casualties when he was killed in action at the age of 25, just
> days before the war's end, 85 years ago this week.
>
> A revered figure in England, Owen found a large American following during
> the Vietnam War. He is often portrayed as antiwar, which he was not. What
> he stood for was seeing war clearly, which makes him especially relevant
> today. The Bush administration has been loudly attacking the news media
for
> misreporting the Iraq conflict by leaving out good news. Owen would
counter
> - in vivid, gripping images - that it is the White House, with its
campaign
> to hide casualties from view, that is dangerously distorting reality.
>
> Owen was born in western England, near the Welsh border, to a middle-class
> family. When the clouds of war were gathering, he was embarking on a
> literary life. Like many young British men, he was caught up in war fever.
> As Dominic Hibberd, a leading Owen scholar, relates in a recent biography,
> Owen reacted to the German threat by writing a poem in which he
approvingly
> cited Horace's dictum, adding that it was "sweeter still" to die in war
> "with brothers." He wrote to his mother, "I now do most intensely want to
> fight."
>
> Owen got his wish. He volunteered for the army in the fall of 1915, and
was
> sent to France. Being there gave him a "fine heroic feeling," he wrote his
> mother a few months later. But before long, Owen was nearly killed by a
> German sniper. Then, while stumbling in the dark, he fell into a 15-foot
> pit and ended up with a concussion. "I have suffered seventh hell," he
> wrote his mother.
>
> A large shell exploded near his head weeks later, throwing him into the
> air, and another, ghoulishly, exhumed a comrade, depositing his corpse
> nearby. Owen was haunted by blood-soaked dreams and, after a diagnosis of
> shell shock, he was committed to a war hospital. He befriended a fellow
> patient, the poet Siegfried Sassoon, and embarked on his most prolific
> period of writing. For Owen, the romance of war was by now long gone. He
> wrote of one wounded soldier, "heavy like meat/And none of us could kick
> him to his feet."
>
> While convalescing, Owen wrote his greatest work, "Dulce et Decorum Est,"
> in which he provided a biting new take on Horace's assessment of death in
> battle. The poem is an account of a gas attack, and of one soldier too
slow
> to put on his "clumsy helmet" who ends up "guttering, choking, drowning."
> Owen concludes by caustically telling the reader that if he had been
there,
> "you would not tell with such high zest/To children ardent for some
> desperate glory/ The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est/Pro patria mori."
>
> When he recovered, Owen was sent back to France to fight. Ordered to lead
> his troops across a canal into heavy enemy machine gun and mortar fire, he
> was killed in the crossing. His mother received a telegram reporting his
> death on Nov. 11, 1918, the day the war officially ended.
>
> Owen, who was commended posthumously for inflicting "considerable losses
on
> the enemy," was no pacifist. He told his mother he had a dual mission: to
> lead his men "as well as an officer can" but also to watch their
> "sufferings that I may speak of them." Owen was right that an honorable
> approach to war requires both ably leading troops on the battlefield, and
> reporting honestly what occurs there.
>
> The Bush administration, however, is resisting this honorable approach. In

"Srueamish" as George employs it means something in the new "Spanglish". It
means "to lick the metaphorical cream off the top". You are revealed,ladies.

Subject:      "17 Reasons," Public Art in San Francisco
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Today was the opening of "17 Reasons" at the Jack Hanley Gallery in
San Francisco.  This show is curated by Jack Hanley and Kate Fowle,
they have invited 20 artists to impose site-specific projects on the
landscape of San Francisco's Mission District.

I'm one of them.  If you have a chance to go to San Francisco please
try and see my piece.  It might not be there for very long since it's
unauthorized by local authorities, but it's standing right at the
corner of Albion and Camp Streets, it's about seven feet high and
three feet wide and two feet deep.  It has a little roof on it with
the name of the piece.  It started with my poem, "There's a Dark
Secret in Me" which was published in an early issue of THE POKER.
Then my collaborator the young artist Colter Jacobsen turned it into
a sculpture.  Now it's sitting there on the corner, very close to
Summi Kaipa's apartment.  Wonder what she'll make of it!  I forgot to
tell her it was going up!  If it rains, many of my words will wash
away.  Check it out before it's too late.  You should get a map and
walk around and see the whole of "17 Reasons," which includes not
only me & Colter but also John Baldessari, Dave Muller, Chris
Johansen, Yoko Ono, Jeffrey Vallance, many more.

Here's the link to get a map.

Try it, see if you enjoy yourselves.  Tell them "Kevin sent you."

PS, thanks everyone who came to Small Press Traffic's 9th annual
Literary Soiree and Auction, which was tremendous fun and all in a
good cause.  That was on Saturday.

i too noticed less of the conversations that happened
here: in the public square. where everyone got dirty
and in everyone else's face.

is it possible that the blogs are the new mall:
drawing all the traffic into compartmentalized shops:
you have to know where to go to get what you want.

no more in your face. too bad. so is "blog" the wave
of the future? and not "list" any more? why is that?
back to possession i guess: "blog" is our own kingdom
where we can say and say. list is, no matter how
unmoderated, still someone else's green.

2 burning questions (and more sub-questions):

1) Are we all fated to be cyborgs? Is the metaphor of "desiring machines"
inevitable as the only alternative to the "traces of fascism in the body"?
I'm reading D & G right now and it's making me kind of angry, not sure why.
I guess it's just that I don't see the motivation for resorting to this
inorganic metaphor...are there other alternatives?

2) This may feed back into the other question: I get from Walter Benjamin's
concept of "the Angel of History" a kind of passive inaction or sense of
mourning which I find attractive, but also slightly disturbing. I am
looking for ways out of this position. What are some of the ways to move or
go? If this Benjamin image embodies a lot of the paradoxical activity &
stasis of the avant-garde, how can I break away from this, and what are
some possible alternatives? What the heck does "post-avant" mean, anyway?
If I do break away from it, am I doomed to a completely nomadic state?

Argh. Any responses, comments, or suggestions of stuff to read would be
much appreciated. Feel free to backchannel or frontchannel.

Thanx,

Tim

Thanks Kari! This is great & I really appreciate it, and mostly agree...

HOWEVER, in a way this is the answer I already had, and it was the answer I
was afraid of getting (was not necessarily looking for answers, but ways to
name provisional solutions), the end of "master-narratives" being simply
another master narrative. Thus the fact you say there are no answers (which
I agree with) is an answer, and I am asking what are the alternatives.
Something has to trump that in the endgame, be this response an "it" or a
multiplicity of solutions...

Best,

Tim

Looks like I'm staying on the green. I'm so busy with my own writing that I
haven't checked out any blogs at length. I was invited to join one last
week, and wouldn't mind, but worry that if I get too involved I won't have
the time I need. Which calls to mind, I just looked on Silliman's Blog for
"writing on the day job," an area I'm eminently qualified to write about,
having spent 26.5 years moonlight by day. I couldn't find it, but would look
at it & comment if anybody can tell me how I can get to it. If not, c'est la
guerre.

Back to work.

i too noticed less of the conversations that happened
here: in the public square. where everyone got dirty
and in everyone else's face.

is it possible that the blogs are the new mall:
drawing all the traffic into compartmentalized shops:
you have to know where to go to get what you want.

no more in your face. too bad. so is "blog" the wave
of the future? and not "list" any more? why is that?
back to possession i guess: "blog" is our own kingdom
where we can say and say. list is, no matter how
unmoderated, still someone else's green.

Ron,

Why no titles in your blog?  I always find your entries virtually essays,
cogent and, er, coherent, therefore not the miscellanies that dating
entries implies.  Ah yes, this makes the blog more difficult to scan
through, but is this an intended difficulty or do you have a principle
against titles?  (BTW, "What" and "The Age of Huts" are two of the most
resonant titles for books in recent years, to my way of thinking.)

Robert

This is probably nothing to add, but my mom really liked Senator John Edwards of
North Carolina, and since this is the only venue I feel like writing in for now,
here goes.  I caught Edwards on CNN or C-Span last night with a live discussion
from New Hampshire.  First, he has hair!  It's reddish brown, and no gray.
Second, he has a chin.  Those two facts alone amaze me.

With those two items he might beat Bush.

Edwards winks at young and old people alike, and seems to be pretty good on his
feet.  He has upper body strength, but unlike Gore he had a wrinkled shirt.  All
those things are in his favor, I think.  Lieberman has no chin, and who wants to
look at that for four years?  Howard Dean looks like a Ben & Jerry's Carton with
that huge head and the spindly legs.  Clark and Kerry are flip-flips, and even
blacks don't like Sharpton.

So it looks like John Edwards might be the guy to run if the Democrats want to
beat Bush.  He looks better than Bush, being younger, and he also has some of
the downhome folksiness of Bush.  He grew up with guns, so the NRA can't gun him
down, but he thinks assault rifles don't make for good sporting hunts.  He has
ideas about education, the arts, etc., which aren't too outlandish.  He's in
favor of enlarging the CIA and getting a domestic intelligence system worthy of
the name going.  This will freak out some of the fringe left but will satisfy
the middle that he is aware that the world is dangerous and that cougars will
leap out of the petunias if you don't watch it.

I'm not saying I'm voting for him.  And if the Greens want to run Nader again
they can still derail the Democrats no matter who runs.  So far though Nader
hasn't thrown his hat in.  I actually think Edwards can beat Bush on the basis
of hair and chin.  He'll get the women's vote, and men won't think of him as a
sissy or a Gore-bore.  I think he's the only guy who can beat Bush out of this
line-up.  He said that he loved the arts, and would be their champion, as that's
the only sign of a good civilization after it's gone (he said that, or something
like that, but he mentioned the NEH rather than the NEA.  The NEH funds academic
studies, while the NEA funds creative endeavors.).

Does anybody else know anything else about Edwards?

I wake with a sun,


the most beautiful boy in the world.
I have yet to drive you away, I
mention, with my paranoia and
clinging acknowledgement


of scars? No-one has ever
been faithful to me, and so I
killed her with my dead morning calls.
Because I couldn't believe her.

I woke up and trailed
my fingers over my chest.
It made a ghost of sound.
Bright sidewalk chalks.

I was whole all morning long.

You know what they say
about the beautiful boys
and the cracked: we are
their shadows. We run cold
across their beds. Veins
concurrent with
their sex. Who
could be faithful to
a hole?

I want you to know
he's not coming back.

Look into my eyes.
It's the only way you'll know if
I'm telling the truth.

I told the boy I wanted everything
to wake her up to know the stars
to parallel with her a stiller
stream beneath which blankets
working fucking stars to flick
you're not my dad off my silk skin,

to tell that kid Mike and I saw
all alone in his front yard beating
a tree with a branch that the branch
should be forgotten, but the tree

needs you to sit at its
roots, in the shade. There's nothing
to be afraid of.

We live without
pasts here.

from ABC News Australia:

Arte Povera giant Mario Merz dies in Italy
Italian artist Mario Merz, a leading exponent of the Arte Povera=20
movement which incorporates humble everyday materials into paintings,=20
has died in Turin aged 83, according to ANSA news agency.
Merz was awarded the Japan Arts Association's Praemium Imperiale, the=20
world's richest arts prize, earlier this year, receiving the=20
prestigious prize in Tokyo only last month.
Merz occupied a central place in Italy's artistic scene since his first=20=

exhibition in Turin in 1954.
In the 1960s, he embarked on an association with a number of other=20
Italian artists who began piercing their canvases with unorthodox=20
materials like bottles, umbrellas, plants, coal and other objects.
It became known as Arte Povera ("poor art"), to signify its=20
anti-elitist protest against consumerism and placed Italy in the=20
vanguard of the international art scene of the 1960s.
"Arte Povera is important because it is linked to life ... it is=20
necessary to use anything whatsoever from life in art, not to reject=20
things because one thinks that life and art are mutually exclusive,"=20
Merz said.
Merz's multi-media sculptures often included large figures like the=20
igloo and the spiral, and later using neon, he reflected Fibonacci=20
mathematical sequences in his art.
His most commonly-used materials were stone, earth, wood, metal and=20
glass, as well as newspapers and bits of fruit.
The Guggenheim Museum in New York dedicated its entire space to a=20
retrospective of his work in 1989.



FLASH ART NEWSLETTER

With Mario Merz one of the main protagonists in Italian postwar art has=20=

vanished.
Mario Merz, one of the main protagonists of Italian and international=20
postwar art, passed away Sunday morning at the age of 78. He was born=20
in Milan in 1925 and lived in Turin. He interrupted his studies in=20
medicine in order to dedicate himself completely to art. His first=20
ventures into painting were characterized by a strong=20
expressionist-informal component, which wasn=92t foreign to his=20
friendships with Pinot Gallizio, Emilio Vedova, Asger Jorn, etc. In=20
those years he also met his future wife Marisa, herself destined to an=20=

important artistic career, the only woman in the Arte Povera entourage.=20=

Towards the mid =9270s he was one of the founders of the historical Arte=20=

Povera group named by Germano Celant. He began working with natural=20
materials (stone, wood, earth, fruit...) combined with industrial=20
materials (neon, glass, cement...) in organic installations that=20
compose archetypical figures: for instance, the igloo and the spiral.
In these same years he used the research on the Fibonacci sequence, a=20
series of numbers derived from the sum of the previous two numbers,=20
named after the mathematician who studied it. The Fibonacci sequence=20
together with the igloo and the spiral =97 trademarks of the Milanese=20
artist =97 arranged in huge spirals or straight lines, refer to the=20
continuous cycle and structure of biological life.
Already in 1967 he was included in the pages of Flash Art, in Germano=20
Celant=92s famous manifesto on Arte Povera =93Appunti per una =
guerriglia,=94=20
which signalled the official birth of Arte Povera. In 1989,=20
international recognition arrived with retrospectives at the Guggenheim=20=

in New York and at the MOCA in Los Angeles. Among the major group shows=20=

we remember =93When attitudes become form=94 (Bern, 1969) and Documenta =
5=20
(Kassel, 1972). Recently, his retrospectives were held in the Museu de=20=

Serralves, Porto in 1999 and in the Mus=E9e d=92Art Modern et =
Contemporain,=20
Nice in 2000. Last October, Mario Merz was the recipient of the=20
important career prize, the Imperial Premium for the Arts in Tokyo.

will keep as a memory the long and suggestive luminous Fibonacci series=20=

still installed along the Mole Antonelliana.

For the short answer as to why Iraq is a disaster, I suspect historians are
going to appreciate this quote from the USA head of the Occupation there:

"There are going to be increased attacks and increased terrorism because the
terrorists can see the reconstruction dynamic is moving in our direction,"
Mr. Bremer was quoted as saying.

"It will be more of a problem in the months ahead unless the intelligence
gets better."

"Unless our intelligence gets better, we're going to have a problem," he
added, seemingly conceding that coalition forces were at a disadvantage
coming to grips with the Iraqi insurgents.

Dear Shanna,

Your post from awhile back just came to my attention. I apologize for the delay in responding. First
thank you for complimenting me on the "astounding energy I bring to the MAG." This feels great to
hear. I feel very good about your press and hope the MAG has the opportunity of featuring Soft Skull
in an upcoming issue.

I want to clear up some points you brought up in your post. (see below)

First, The MAG and Culture Animal are two separate entities. The MAG is an international literary
quarterly with 50 co-editors around the world. The MAG presents the work of authentic, individual
writers: Over 700 in the current First Anniversary Issue. (www.muse-apprentice-guild.com)

Culture Animal is my literary work. All the authors in Culture Animal are my personae. (see
www.cultureamimal.com)

None of my personae appear in the MAG. And there has never been any attempt by me to mislead anyone.
My work is called "Metapoetics Theatre" and the use of personae is an integral and explicit element
in my work.





sincerely,
august highland

the editors was being forthcoming about the pseudonyms, even though they are
obvious to all. I guess I just don't feel like having my chain yanked, and I
assume many others have felt the same way.

But I've gotta admit, the energy you bring to the project is astounding,

Subject: The Intelligence Problem
Date: Mon, 10 Nov 2003 14:57:23 -0800

For the short answer as to why Iraq is a disaster, I suspect historians are
going to appreciate this quote from the USA head of the Occupation there:

"There are going to be increased attacks and increased terrorism because the
terrorists can see the reconstruction dynamic is moving in our direction,"
Mr. Bremer was quoted as saying.

"It will be more of a problem in the months ahead unless the intelligence
gets better."

"Unless our intelligence gets better, we're going to have a problem," he
added, seemingly conceding that coalition forces were at a disadvantage
coming to grips with the Iraqi insurgents.

Yes, the hair, yes. Yes, the chin, yes. Youthful,
despite his fifty years, yes...

My "but" is this: He seems so focused on Rural America (and I can sympathize
having recently been through the Carolinas), he fails to adequately address
the future of Urban America.

I think some of that upper-bod development came from lifting those heavy
bales of dough the Lear-jet lawyers have sent his way. Some 60% + of his
backing comes from those buddies.

But, then these are just issues... leaves me wondering if he can be another

Tim, I want to answer in light of yr second question concerning "the Angel of History" and "post-Avant": I say dismantle the labeling. If you really want to break away from such constraints, the point must be to take a direction you feel is necessary. By REacting through Benjamin and this sense of POST-Avant Garde, then you're basically saying to yourself, "here are my limits here, where else are my limits?" Think about it. A research will get you some places and experiment on the other side of that will get you elsewhere. You should focus deeply on an examination of things. Have you read Walker Percy's "The Message in a Bottle..."? Pretend you are an alien and you crash down onto earth. You see the happenings of manifold events, places and things, but you are at degree zero, without a context. Perhaps a survey of the things you are vying for need to be looked at by the virgin eye and later examined along-side these troubles, if you would like to call them that. You need to b
 e of two minds: one insightful, to see the correlation of events, and two, you must be an alien, experience things AGAIN and AGAIN by being tabla rasa. My writing has thrived in this sense and new questions have developed with some old ones, either/or revising the other. This is one human's opinion, but I believe that being reactionary one tends to forget to stop and smell the elephants.

For those of you in or around San Francisco near Thanksgiving, I wanted
to let you know that Mytili Jagannathan & I will be reading together at
Small Press Traffic on Friday, Nov. 21st.

This is a double debut, for my new book "Rouge State," just out from
Pavement Saw Press, and for Mytili's ACTS, fresh from David Hadbawnik's
habenicht press.  These are first books for us both (is that right,
Mytili?), so the room will be acrackle with youth and new book fumes.
If you're in town, come hear us and say hello.

FRIDAY, NOV. 21st, 7:30 p.m.
Timken Lecture Hall, California College of the Arts (formerly CCAC)
1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the intersection of 16th and
Wisconsin)
$5-$10 sliding scale, free to SPT members
see www.spttraffic.org for more details

MYTILI JAGANNATHAN was selected for a Pew Fellowship in 2002; her work
has appeared in Xcp: Cross Cultural Poetics, Combo, Interlope, and
Mirage; and is forthcoming in the anthology "Cities of Chance: An
Anthology of New Poetry from thw United States and Brazil."  She joins
us from Philadelphia in celebration of the publication of her first book
by David Hadbawnik's new habenicht press.

RODNEY KOENEKE was born in Omaha in 1968 and grew up in Tucson and Los
Angeles.  He's lived in or about San Francisco since 1986.  He has
published a book of history, Empires of the Mind: I.A. Richards and
Basic English in China, 1929-1979 (Stanford UP, 2003);  Rouge State is
his first full-length poetry collection.

"In Rouge State, Rodney Koeneke puts the blush back on the demotic.  His
idiomatic montage is a careening screed dictated from a state of alert,
all puns intended to turn the hose back on a culture run literally
amuck, and whose marquee reads: Raw, Red, Rouge, Incarnadine.  Welcome
to these states!"

""Cannily an(a)esthet(ic)izing the misogynist and orientalist phantasms
that are projected onto the digital plateaux of its own prosodic
bravado, this is how Naked Lunch might have turned out had it been
written by Robert Browning having a sex change operation.  There can be
but one sordid bordello of this magnitude, and Koeneke has erected it
squarely at the fissure where the simulacrul Middle America of Pop
Warner and bubble top vans collides with a paracolonial hallucination of
Eastern inscrutability inhabited by five-dollar houris and hack oud
players.  These elegant verses have teeth, and be warned: behind each
incisor lurks a Dunciad."

Too many labels poison the air. Instead, I posit "Present Writing."  t is
too wisely applicable, but the senses in which one applies it will quickly
become clear. David Bromige.

Hi Tim,


I am much more familiar with Benjamin's writing than that
of Deleuze and Guittari. But I am not clear why you want to "break away"
from Walter Benjamin. I don't see the passivity you see in
this work and I would be interested in hearing you explain what
you mean. For me, Benjamin's critique has to do with the loss
of individual perception, comprehension and assertion and the fading ability
to think for oneself. What he found exciting in Surrealism and Baudelaire,it
seems to me, had more to do with his anxiety about the tendency of people in
contemporary life to conform. He tried to reveal the
false linearity seen in history from the point of view of rigid,
conformist, academic thinking. My favorite line of his is: "Continuity in
historical terms is that of the oppressors. History for the
oppressed is that of discontinuity." Like many  so-called
avant-gardists, Benjamin was tracking within the fissures and cracks of
received viewpoints, the texture of experiences from which he might be
able to draw actual perceptions. Rereading your paragraph now,
it seems you are freaking out in the fun-house mirrors of
contemporary literary terminology. I have the feeling that
you are frustrated by the hypnotic effect of labyrinthine, fashionable
academic terminology. If  you need a good dose of hilarious,  but
wierdly liberating reactionary writing, try some E. M. Cioran,
in particular, *The Trouble With Being Born*.  My other favorite
antidotes for this kind of mood are: *The Notebooks of Samuel Butler*, and
the writings of William Hazlitt.

I just can't get it up
for nature no more.
Writes the exit
on all the little mallets.
One night Leslie
got up to use the bathroom
quite late. Every taut string
beaten.

I gather goodbyes the way
wind ripped around his hand, turning
what was once flat now joyously
defined in the shape of her
body, or all night I'm up
pasting shadows over my cuts until
I feel like her memory.
All night I'm up turning
worms into gold.

That squirrel got hit
by a car and lay there
by the road until
every summer night stiffened
with frost, and you
stopped waiting for me
to see and now its
snowed-in bones show through,

just a trace of a tail like
the first fossilized bird.

Don't even want
to jerk off.

Well. I guess it was a nomad meatloaf and that made its wretched
provenance all the more alluring to Pierre. As he says, "The days of
anything static--form, content, state--are over," and apparently that
goes double for ground chuck.

But "Goldberg boxers." Were those Rube Goldberg boxers? I had a Rube

A-ha--thanks for clearing up my misunderstanding. I think my initial
experience was so confusing that I conflated the two, as you say. I admit to
being completely overwhelmed by the breadth of your project, and gave up

joke that I couldn't get.

Best to (all of) you.

Lovely to get some pixels out of funny uncle David even if he is
discussing Maria's "metaphorical cream." She's a very private person,
you know, with lots of convenient memory lapses.

ANNOUNCING
_Anatman, Pumpkin Seed, Algorithm_
by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier

An announcement that my new poetry collection, _Anatman, Pumpkin Seed,=20
Algorithm_ is coming out next week. It's a book of poetry about the poetics=
=20
of being in the present time and place, like "here" (as on this list),=20
where language is both distributed and present. As part of its project,=20
_Anatman_ dips in and out of mixing computer/Web language, layers of human=
=20
languages (including Spanish and indigenous tongues), and the translucent=20
veils of senses of the Americas. It also experiments at the places where=20
poetry writing, machine modulation of language, and procedure converge.=20
It's the creative language multiple of my digital peregrinations, some of=20
them at least, the gain and loss of manifold forms of inscription,=20
presented in a style that delights in the play of those language=20
experiences, those archeological layers of location, those=20
Caribbean/Pacific sea colors of tropical time. Info about the book,=20
including a reproduction of my cover image for it (a concrete poem view of=
=20
its world), is available from the _Anatman, Pumpkin Seed, Algorithm_ link=20
at my author page

Thanks!

Small Press Traffic presents
Friday, November 14, 2003 at 7:30 p.m.
Xcp Magazine Benefit Event
with Mark Nowak & Wang Ping

Join us in celebrating and supporting one of the finest and most visionary
magazines around, Xcp: Cross Cultural Poetics. Editor Mark Nowak?s
multidisciplinary work includes publications in anthropology, poetry/poetics,
cultural studies, and photography. He is the author of a poetry collection,
Revenants, co-editor with Diane Glancy of the acclaimed anthology Visit Teepee
Town: Native Writings After the Detours (both from Coffee House Press).
Contributor Wang Ping is the author of a novel, Foreign Devil, a short story
collection, American Visa, and a collection of poetry, Of Flesh & Spirit
(Coffee House). Anne Waldman says "she explodes the safe boundaries of
culture, gender, and female sexuality?[her] meditations reveal the
incongruities between byzantine bureaucracy and the needs of a free spirit."
They both join us from St. Paul.

Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to SPT members,
and CCAC faculty, staff, and students.
Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in

____THE DISCRETE SERIES @ 3030______

presents the Goat Island Performance Group


[Goat Island is a Chicago-based collaborative performance group:
Karen Christopher, Matthew Goulish, Lin Hixson (director), Mark Jeffery, CJ
Mitchell (company manager), Margaret Nelson (technical director), Bryan
Saner, and Lit=F3 Walkey.

Members contribute to the conception, research, writing, choreography,
documentation, and educational demands of the work. Characteristically they
attempt to establish a spatial relationship with audiences, other than the
usual proscenium theater situation, which may suggest a concept, such as
sporting arena or parade ground, or may create a setting for which there is
no everyday comparison. They perform a personal vocabulary of movement, bot=
h
dance-like and pedestrian, that often makes extreme physical demands on the
performers, and attention demands on the audience. Goat Island incorporates
historical and contemporary issues through text and movement. They create
visual/spatial images to encapsulate thematic concerns and place their
performances in non-theatrical sites when possible. Goat Island researches
and writes collaborative lectures for public events, and often subsequently
publish these, either in their own artists' books, or in professional
journals.

Goat Island was founded in 1987 and incorporated in 1989 as a non-profit
organization to produce collaborative performance works developed by its
members for local, national, and international audiences. Seven completed
works include Soldier, Child, Tortured Man (1987); We Got A Date (1989);
Can't Take Johnny to the Funeral (1991); It's Shifting, Hank (1993); How
Dear to Me the Hour When Daylight Dies (1996); The Sea & Poison (1998); and
It's an Earthquake in My Heart (2001). The company has toured the US and
England, Scotland, Wales, Belgium, Switzerland, Croatia, Germany, and
Canada. 2002 sees the start of development on an eighth performance.]

Friday, Nov. 14 9PM / 3030 W. Cortland / $5 suggested donation / BYOB



3030 is a former Pentecostal church located at 3030 W. Cortland Ave., one
block south of Armitage between Humboldt Blvd. and Kedzie. Parking is
easiest on Armitage.

The Discrete Series will present an event of
poetry/music/performance/something on the second Friday of each month.

I was inspired by the dollar bill's ubiquity to write through some instances in "Anarchy Is Not Enough" and titled the poem 'Myth', which coincidentally appears as the title of the opening text in said book. Some refernces to Hejinian & Stein thrown in for good measure, or not. Enjoy.

Myth

A. As I was saying, reminded of our recent algorithm.

B. Immediately forget you are permanently ephemeral.

C. All necessary implication of dailiness has long disappeared from the word ‘journal’.

D. I befriend myself & no longer exist.

E. A repository for whatever one does without knowing why.

F. As long as there is a form & a system.

G. I am a ghost of a former atrocity, that is, myself.

H. We are nearly through with living.

I. Tell me, who can be bothered with knowledge.

J. The individual is a mathematical exaggeration of its responsibilities.

K. It is all the truth it knows, that is, it knows nothing.

L. As you quoted, being ephemeral.

M. Endless is falling from a height.

N. I thank myself & am appalled.

O. A sea that stretches the dailiness between us.

P. I was wondering, but then I stopped wondering.

Q. What happens to the individual.

R. History of alimony & who owes it.

S. If routine & dailiness should go on forever.

T. A disjunction in the familiar 'you'.

U. As I have remarked.

V. Weather being the exaggeration of an implied military-industrial complex.

W. I keep a journal as a reminder to write in my journal.

X. Why.

Y. I say there is a form to this insistence.

Z. Did you forget already.

Subject:      Re: The Intelligence Problem
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Indeed  - but there are cross links to the cyborg question. The last Iraq
war was fought in a heavily networked environment - including the use of
chat-rooms for decision making - with TCP/IP making it's debut in a war
situation for possibly the first time.  US intelligence (also, to a lesser
extent, Western intelligence) now has a heavy reliance on using machines
for intelligence - sigint as I've seen it called - which paid dividends in
a strict European-style war, as the first phase of the war undoubtedly was.
However, when faced with an enemy which refuses to play this game - as in
Iraq, and with Al Quaida generally - human intelligence (humint) comes to
the fore. But this has been neglected - and, lets face it, it is a more
expensive and laborious job - so it's not surprising that this has become a
point of failure for the US forces in Iraq. You may be able to fight like
the Borg against an equal(ish) enemy, but trying to tie down a guerilla
opposition is plainly a different kettle-of-fish.  Asymetric wars reflect
opposing cultures which face each other in an asymetric manner (compare
European Napoleonic battles with Iraq). More Kipling than Foucault. In
fact, Kipling delineated a lot of asymetric war - he knew them as colonial
wars with spears against Martini Henrys and Armstrong Whitworth RMLs.

Disengaging oneself from the cyborg cocoon is a difficult proposition,
particularly when engaging oneself has become  a fashionable thing to do.
Particularly when faced with projectiles and people that hate you, and an
enemy that refuses to engage in an "orthodox" manner. Launching oneself
into a new set of cultural circumstances is always a stressful (and
expensive) business and requires, in organisations, a political
willingness. For example, teaching soldiers to speak Iraqi is one thing the
US forces might do if they wanted to amelioriate relationships - and gain
human intelligence.  To a large extent, this means grappling with Iraqi
cuture, if such an articfact exists as I suspect there are several cultures
within the post-colonial construct called Iraq - but, the point is made. As
a matter of interest British Intelligence during the 2WW used to hold 6
week Japanese courses for English speakers. At the end of it, the graduates
were able to decipher at least rudimentary messages (See "The Emporers
Codes").

On a more abstract culture clash level it will be interesting to see if
"democracy" - as in Bush's "democratic deficit" - can be imposed on
present-day Iraq. Or on the rest of the middle east. Post-modern
imperialism is with us, and I do not welcome it.

For the short answer as to why Iraq is a disaster, I suspect historians are
going to appreciate this quote from the USA head of the Occupation there:

"There are going to be increased attacks and increased terrorism because
the
terrorists can see the reconstruction dynamic is moving in our direction,"
Mr. Bremer was quoted as saying.

"It will be more of a problem in the months ahead unless the intelligence
gets better."

"Unless our intelligence gets better, we're going to have a problem," he
added, seemingly conceding that coalition forces were at a disadvantage
coming to grips with the Iraqi insurgents.

George,

I love you dearly, but as a former United States Marine and on Veterans Day
(in the US) this is not the correct thing to say. The machinery that is the
US gov't is the group who put in place this disaster. The 101st is a group
of men and women who have been led to conduct the disaster that has taken
place in Iraq.

Tom, thanks very much for the word. But I never saw the ABC of Myth to be a defense. I like the poem as a list, of its impermanence, but insistence. Systematic, discounting system, too. I was at first aware of ping-pong things happening with the ABC's. I imagine two readers. Anyone else?

Yrs,

Chris

Chris--

I meant "armature" in the sense of visible hanger or spine. The list is great
but why highlight the 26 letters?  I understand the impulse but what does it
add? Except, of course, for that x/why pun.

Some times I think the spine of a poem needs to fall away so that the body
can be felt in its particularity.

Yes, I have to agree with Geoffrey's assessment here. And I only wish we
could EMBED our government with the 101st... EMBED Cheney... EMBED Bush...
EMBED Rumsfeld... EMBED Wolfowitz... and on and on.... on down the chain
until all of us everywhere are EMBEDDED. And, by the way, I intentionally
placed the Vice-President before the President.

With all EMbedDED let soldiers hunt down
the killing and the killed. Let them cross
the Triangle with care fully alive fearing death
into firestorms choked with dust. Maybe then
we'll come to know the dead and the maimed
of this unfolding failure, this complete mess.

with prayers today as most days,
Gerald Schwartz

Of course I am. How could I not. I fretted over attributing a quote for it
but figured that you would get it right off the bat. Sorry for the moment of
confusion.

It's a strange set of feelings being in a war zone. I was in the first
debacle and lost some very close friends to stupidity. It's not the human
beings in the uniforms that are at most fault. And yes I have problems
making this argument stick .... but it's a strange set of feelings.

We probably agree on every point -- but today is not the right day for me.
Salt in wounds and all of that. I hope you understand and take this as it is
meant and not as stepping on your toes.

best, Geoffrey

Either we nip it in the bud, or we go to war later.  200,000 young men (boys at

That applies also to poetry.

It seems to me the basic idea of history Benjamin is attacking in his image
of angel of history is "progress." The opposite of history as progress is
dialectic history where artifacts or objects of childhood (horse carriages, train
stations, etc.) are experienced and analyzed as dreams -revealing the forces
making us.

Upcoming readings:
Nov.29- Kyle Conner presents Corina Copp & Joseph Massey (benefit for
MoveOn.org)
Dec.13- Gary Sullivan & Sofia Memon

Reading report:

Jenn McCreary presented Kevin Varrone & Rachel Blau DuPlessis.

Kevin Varrone made us cuckoo for cocoa puffs & dodo for almanac, reading
from the Autumn section of his ongoing G-Point Almanac project. He sent out
small noodles of energy that brought iambs to their knees. Varrone created
dragons ripe for the slaying, luring them (& us) in with the existential
salt lick.

Rachel Blau DuPlessis read from the Drafts- rewritten in quasi-sonnet form.
It was made clear that she was working loosely with the form, so Don Riggs
wouldn=92t get fututzed about the details of genre definition. She gave a
shout-out to the Baltimore contingent in the house, & cracked open her poem=
s
with the intensity of an unremembered dream.

Much of the audience re-convened at a birthday party for Barbara's family
friend. Jena & Hassen called it a night while Matt, Fran & I went to Dirty
Frank's for de-briefing.

Thanks so much for these comments, Nick. It helps...be assured that I am
not just talking from my head, but also from the part of the everyday
experience I have of continually feeling frustrated and uncomfortable with
people in general who seem enamored with the idea of being cyborgs. It's
more a
response to social conditions I really don't understand and that upset me than
to academic theory. I know I must be right in some respect, because I trust my
own reactions to things, and I know that when I spend an hour or two online
blogging, reading blogs or online journals, etc., I begin to feel ill, just
physically and mentally ill. I don't have another way to explain it. There's
something missing there, for me, and I guess I'm trying to find a way to name
what it is...

Best,

Tim

Hi Tim,

I am much more familiar with Benjamin's writing than that of Deleuze and
Guittari. But I am not clear why you want to "break away" from Walter
Benjamin.
I don't see the passivity you see in this work and I would be interested in
hearing you explain what you mean. For me, Benjamin's critique has to do with
the loss of individual perception, comprehension and assertion and the fading
ability to think for oneself. What he found exciting in Surrealism and
Baudelaire,it seems to me, had more to do with his anxiety about the tendency
of people in contemporary life to conform. He tried to reveal the false
linearity seen in history from the point of view of rigid, conformist,
academic
thinking. My favorite line of his is: "Continuity in historical terms is that
of the oppressors. History for the oppressed is that of discontinuity." Like
many so-called avant-gardists, Benjamin was tracking within the fissures and
cracks of received viewpoints, the texture of experiences from which he might
be able to draw actual perceptions. Rereading your paragraph now, it seems you
are freaking out in the fun-house mirrors of contemporary literary
terminology.
I have the feeling that you are frustrated by the hypnotic effect of
labyrinthine, fashionable academic terminology. If you need a good dose of
hilarious, but wierdly liberating reactionary writing, try some E. M. Cioran,
in particular, *The Trouble With Being Born*. My other favorite antidotes for
this kind of mood are: *The Notebooks of Samuel Butler*, and the writings of
William Hazlitt.

Please come see two fabulous Bay Area writers!

kari edward=92s poetry plays with the fluidity of a
gendered subject, creating a text where poetry, prose
and hyperreality merge:  =93I am the night mother in the
nubian eight, I am the night buoy asking to sink in
the mother. I am the buoy asking to sink in the night
mother=94 (from =93a napkin ring for my silent butter=94).
edwards is a poet, artist and gender activist, winner
of New Langton Art=92s Bay Area Award in literature
(2002), author of iduna, O Books (2003), a day in the
life of p. , subpress collective (2002), a diary of
lies - Belladonna #27 by Belladonna Books (2002),

and post/(pink) Scarlet Press (2000). She is also the
poetry editor I.F.G.E=92s Transgender -Tapestry: a
International Publication on Transgender issues. Her
work has been exhibited throughout the united states,
including denver art museum, new orleans contemporary
art museum, university of california-san diego, and
university of massachusetts - amherst. edwards=92 work
can also be found in Experimental Theology, Public
Text 0.2., Seattle Research Institute (2003), Blood
and Tears: Poems for Matthew Shepard, Painted leaf
Press (2000), Aufgabe, Fracture, Bombay Gin,

of Contemporary American Poetry, Narrativity,
Bathhouse, The Journal of Bisexuality, Milk Magizine,
Moria, Boog City, and The International Journal of
Sexuality and Gender Studies.

Chris Nealon=92s poetry raises the lyric to an ironic
ecstacy, but is no less sincere for it:
=93I'm misprision / I'm direct address / Apostrophe a
condom / And my stomach hurts
Calendula: You Flower / O Chronicle / My Emperor=94
(from Ecstasy Shield).  Nealon was born in Long
Island, New York and lived in Boston and Seattle
before coming to SF to teach at UC Berkeley in 1996.
He has a 2001 chapbook from Black Square Editions,
Ecstasy Shield, and a 2001 book from Duke University
Press called Foundlings: Lesbian and Gay Historical
Emotion before Stonewall.  Black Square is also
bringing out a book of poems, The Joyous Age, next
year. He owns tons of flags and haven't illegally
downloaded anything.

This message regards everyone on the list, whom I have to personally thank for giving me new hope.

First off, a very formal introduction:

My name is Christophe Casamassima. I am a co-founder of Furniture_Press and editor of Ambit: Journal of Poetry & Poetics. I also run a summer reading series in Baltimore called One West. I am a New Yorker by birth but moved to Baltimore in 2001 looking for a new experience. Enough-

I've been writing in Baltimore seriously for about a year & a half ago, starting up the Press to gather up the disparate & divided voices of writers who did not fit the mold of, locally, the Baltimore Writer's Association & the Maryland Writer's Association. In the hopes of giving a forum to these writers I began Ambit, which, initially, was meant to be a local journal of new, experimental writing; but Ambit expanded into the American population, gathering some excellent new texts by writers from all over the country.

I believe folks from around the nation are getting to know us quite well. I've even collaborated with kari edwards in the second issue to give the readers a contrast between two localities of writing brought together through an editorial partnership. The question that remains open is, what is to become of Baltimore, then? Am I neglecting local readership and writers? Baltimore is not exactly the cream of the crop in new & exciting writing. My question is, finally, what kind of support can the Baltimore area provide for a new project that wants to gather disparate, divided writers?

I am beginning to approach faculty at several local campuses (University of Baltimore, Goucher, Johns Hopkins, Towson University, Notre Dame, Villa Julie, &c. &c.) to try and figure out what exactly a Baltimore Poetics can be. I am thrilled that we have Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and NYC close at hand, & with an already established group of writers who are constantly challenging & redefining what exactly it means to be a poet in this day & age.

Would anyone on this list like to contribute ideas, stories, resources, an ear, time, to this development? Would anyone like to say how I can approach this new field of inquiry? Can someone provide a point of departure? A review of the magazine? The website when it eventually is put up? [The website will have a portion of it dedicated to a forum that will map out the existence & nature of Baltimore Poetics plus feature small, independent presses from around the country in order to establish a dialogue between all up & coming communities.]

Everyone, your ear is summoned. What's next?

Peace & such,

Christophe Casamassima

Hello unto you,

You may have noticed that Sleepy Brain Magazine has quietly slipped into its
Third Phase: a return to theme-based concerns. What this means for now is
simply a division of labour. The site has been split into 7 sections:
Unclassifiable (Exceptional Culture); Screen Culture (Film, Animation, TV);
Sound+Music (Varying Extremes); Visual Art (Galleries/Interviews);
Literature (Interviews/Excerpts); New Media (Mainly the Web); and Cosmology
(Extreme Culture). Each section has a curator/editor appointed to it, who
will commission/review/interview one piece of work/one artist per month in
their particular category. As always, the focus will be on strange little
scenarios from mighty conurbations around the world.

We are always looking for new content, so if you have any pertinent
suggestions please feel free to send 'em to the editor/curator concerned
(see bios and contact details below). And remember the words of the immortal
Mark N: "You know as well as I do that pigeonholes are there to be shat in".

exciting ways to document new forms of writing in the temporal, video
medium; styles of writing which are new as a result of recent changes in
culture or advances in technology. Rebecca is dedicated to open access modes
of distribution, and where possible applies copyleft ideologies to her
productions – predominantly to her video zine Some Underground Machine. The
next Some Underground Machine video zine will be released on region-free DVD

Tim,

Who answered or contextualized your burning question?  It's looks you did,
a move that Herr Walter would appreciate.

I don't think getting ill from reading material online means anything
diagnostic.  People who reduce the cyborg to interface btw computers and
men are just not thinking hard enough.  (Besides, why, being as smart as
they are, would they want us?  cf. Hal.)

In last Friday's edition of the Oneonta Star there was an AP story about
how Bush had said that it was time to support freedom from Damascus to
Tehran.  Probably he didn't dare to mention Pakistan because we still
have one of our sons of bitches in there.  Or if he isn't ours, he is at
least friendly to the current government.  Bush stated quite flatly that
we would have to change these regimes.  He didn't say if this would be
by military intervention (always an option), or whether it would be
through intensive support of whatever democratic fragments exist in
those countries, or what.  But, as he saw it, those countries are not
functioning DUE to their lack of freedoms.  And they are blaming their
lack of functionality on us.

Therefore, we either have to change this viewpoint, or go to war with
them.  The longer we wait, the worse it is going to be.

It may still be possible to become friends with the regimes in place in
Damascus and Tehran, but not with this president.  And he'll almost
certainly be the president for another five years.  The democrats are
going to nominate a flake, and the middle of this country is going to
swing right.  The intensive attempts to radicalize the country through
the universities has not only failed, it seems, but created a terrific
backlash.  Now when you mention democrats all you hear is "politically
correct," or "social control."

And the country is swinging more and more to the right as a result.

The right, oddly, is seemingly very concerned with human rights, women's
rights, and even, oddly, gay rights!  IN OTHER COUNTRIES, especially
those countries from Damascus to Tehran.  It may be really about oil.  I
don't think so, though.  I think there are now so many causes and so
many vectors (Bush's dad, Bush's back is up, etc., and 9/11 didn't
help!) that we have to face reality that poets have as much chance of
stopping this than a mosquito has of stopping a rhino.

Sorry Kirby. I'll put this one on-line.

Marxist? Are they still around?

Bush's Axis of Evil is an extension of Nixon's Enemies List. Thus, the basic
problem, it seems to me, is that we--meaning humans--keep making enemies.
It's as if we can't live without them. I'd like to hear the psychology of
this; not the politics, which is of course a strategy of keeping power by
turning the electorate's attention away from failed policies, from how
they're being screwed.
As for the Muslim boys being trained to hate. American boys and girls are
being trained to hate too. It's just more difficult to admit to when they
speak your language and wave your flag.

We do, finally, have to face that poets have little chance of stopping this.
Poets have little chance of stopping anything that is currently happening.
There are, and will be exceptions of course.  This by no means suggests we
should stop trying.  The importance of poetry in my life extends beyond the
surface level of cause and effect, of causing an immediate and obvious
change in reality.  I think poetry has a long term commitment to social
change and if things change more quickly then great.  This is where books
like Jeff Derksen's _Transnational Muscle Cars_ and Louis Cabri's _The Mood
Embosser_ are important to me.  People might read them right now and not
fully 'get' what is going on, but these books exist and though it may be an
unsavoury position to imagine, they could have an effect over a longer
period of time than the economics of publishing will allow.  So maybe the
universities have failed to effect immediate change, but university is where
I discovered poets that made a significant change in the direction of my
live, my politics and my poetics (if those things can be so readily
divided).

just some thots...

This is a (widespread and widely debunked) hoax.

Congress people do, in fact, pay social security.

OK Miekal - honored to have these words join the prophetic dictionary!
I've revised a little bit. Edit as you want. By the way have you used the
convenient new editing software - just out  - called, I believe, the
"McEditor"? Supposedly turns "muck" into Spin.  Oh well,

Thanks!

McPoet (muck poet) n. He or she who writes McPoetry (muck poetry).  A mostly
non-paying job that requires limited creative writing training; provides
little or no opportunity for advancement. Exceptions include
"branding" jobs for trademark and company naming opportunities usually found
available during periods of economic and/or military upswings, i.e.,
"buyoften.com", "thongtech.com", "militarycontract.com", "iraqblaster.com",
etc. Job title is not to be confused with "McSlammer" (muck slammer) as with
he or she who performs "McSlams" (muck slams).

McNovelist (muck novelist). n. He or she who writes "McNovels." A sometimes
financially rewarding writing activity that requires strong skill and
training within conventional forms (mystery, romance, war, etc.);
occasionally provides extraordinary margins of profit on original
time investment. Job not to be confused with "McRaker," (muck raaker).

With all due respect, Tim, I don't understand what you are getting at with
these comments. You have every right to express your feelings of sickness
when you read, and how you are sure that that proves something to your
satisfaction, but how do you get from "people who seem enamored with the
idea  of being cyborgs" ...and "when I spend an hour or two online blogging,
reading blogs or online journals...I begin  to feel ill" to "...there's
something missing there..." What does blogging have to do with cyborgs?  Do
you also get sick when you read books and journals? One medium is
electronic, the books and magazines are made from trees. Both involve
people's writing. Very frequently the same people who read and write books
and articles also read and write blogs and pieces in online journals.



Best wishes,
Nick

Clare Rossini's first full-length collection, Winter Morning with Crow, =
was selected for the l996 Akron Poetry Prize; the book went on to be =
finalist for a Small Press Book Award and for PEN's l999 Joyce Osterweil =
Award for Poetry. Rossini's poems have appeared in numerous journals, =
including The Kenyon Review, The New England Review, and Poetry, as well =
as in textbooks and anthologies, including Poets for the New Century =
(David Godine: Boston, 2002) An Introduction to Poetry (ed. X.J. Kennedy =
and Dana Gioia, Longman: New York, 2002) and Best American Poetry l997 =
(ed. James Tate, Scribners: New York, 1997).  She has received =
fellowships from the Connecticut Commission on the Arts, the Minnesota =
State Arts Board and the Bush Foundation.. Rossini is currently on the =
faculty of Trinity College in Hartford and the MFA program at Vermont =
College in Montpelier, VT.

A review in The Nation of Rossini's first book noted that "All forms are =

Judging by my writing income, I certainly qualify as a McPoet. Since I have

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

On Saturday morning the future giants of St. John's writing met for
another installment of Kevin Hehir's Exploding Language Writing Workshop.
The 12 participants discussed how the Aristotelian narrative arc no longer
effectively mimes our every day discourse so should be discarded in favour
of the jab and parry that fragmentary storytelling affords writers in the
post-media milieu that surrounds us therefore offering an increased level
of sophistication and book sales. If, as post-structuralist, continental
thinker Michel Serres tells us, time is akin to pure light as poured
through a colander. Then, what happens when a weather channel poetics is
pushed down a playground slide into the waiting jaws of serial toboggany?
Then we talked about Hegel's Bagels as a possible position on an axis of
names for synthetic breakfast foods. In theory, wholesome but praxis has
proved that they hurt the molars. [The mandible rhizome that reveals
itself through the sliding continuum of jaw-molar was not lost on one
young poet with a fresh nick on his chin from a 23 cent disposable razor].
Then we ate muffins and made fun of our parents.

I had vague memories of a creative writing professor (maybe a McCreative
Writing Professor?) writing a McPoem (yes, that's the title) about 25 years
ago. Not sure of the ethics, copyright & otherwise of posting it here
without his permission, and he's not someone I know well or am in contact
with. But since I found it this morning on his web site, I thought I'd post
a link to it. I remember hating this poem ages ago; now, if I read it with
a biting irony, as in Charles Bernstein's recent poem, "Thank You for
Saying Thank You" (although I think the irony in that poem is complicated,
with many of the statements being absolutely straightforward) in his
chapbook, *Let's Just Say,* I don't dislike it at all. But I don't think
such irony is intended here.

Mime-Version: 1.0

Nick, in this case I think it's very much an issue of "the medium is the
message" -- there is something fundamentally different about the activity
of blogging and reading blogs from say, reading a journal or a book.
Perhaps what I'm talking about here is the conflation of the blog with its
author or writer -- the blog being a kind of virtual extension of the self
that is potentially exciting, potentially worrying. I'm tempted to bring up
Kent Johnson's critiques of authorship, but I will simply gesture at those.
I guess what I'm saying is that, In a way, blogs form an incomplete map of
the social sphere and project this virtual map back onto the real in a way
that I think is fairly new for poetry, at least. The other thing that's new
about it is 1)speed and 2)accessibility. As several frames run in
succession appear to create the motion of a film, so a series of frequent
blog entries contributes to the creation of a virtual person who is
fundamentally different from a real person, more mercurial somehow, while
also evoking and limited to all the paradoxes of textuality or textual
speech. As an easy example: a blog is not a listserv -- the two function in
very different ways, and I would posit that a listserv actually allows for
a more communal, democratic discussion.

Best,

Tim

With all due respect, Tim, I don't understand what you are getting at with
these comments. You have every right to express your feelings of sickness
when you read, and how you are sure that that proves something to your
satisfaction, but how do you get from "people who seem enamored with the
idea of being cyborgs" ...and "when I spend an hour or two online blogging,
reading blogs or online journals...I begin to feel ill" to "...there's
something missing there..." What does blogging have to do with cyborgs? Do
you also get sick when you read books and journals? One medium is
electronic, the books and magazines are made from trees. Both involve
people's writing. Very frequently the same people who read and write books
and articles also read and write blogs and pieces in online journals.
Best wishes, Nick

   "Nissan Motors is planting actors in movie theaters to perform live
   commercials before the start of showings of 'The Matrix
   Revolutions' in an effort to expose jaded, skeptical consumers to
   advertising by masking it as something else. The brief in-person
   pitches feature actors scattered among the ticket-buying audience
   who stand and deliver lines that evoke the words spoken by poets at
   events known as slams or jams. Their performances are timed to
   accompany a commercial the audience sees on the movie screen, which
   begins without identifying the sponsor but concludes with the
   Nissan Altima logo. The campaign by the Nissan North America
   division of Nissan Motor, intended to pique the curiosity of
   younger consumers about the Nissan Altima sedan, began yesterday in
   theaters operated by the Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corporation
   in seven large markets and is scheduled to continue through
   tomorrow."

I didn't want to say Mc (muck) about anything else, but these specially
trained actors who splatter poems quo ads to movie audiences are known in
the ad trade as the aforementioned "McSlammers."  (A union base pay job,
$300 a day plus benefits).

Jason Christie --

Your post was quite welcome.  As we only get two posts a day (a good idea, too,
I think), I wasn't able to respond yesterday.  I liked the tone of your post,
and many of the points that you made.  What concerns me in academia is the
tendency to off conservatives.  This has led to a situation in which there are
only three self-reported conservatives among 450 humanities faculty for instance
at Duke University.  This is supposed to make students more amenable to leftist
programming.  What it has done however is create conditions in which the
academic left is increasingly out of touch with the mainstream of America as
they have silenced those voices from ever reaching them.  As a result, they
don't know what the right is saying, and they are getting killed in the hearts
and minds of the ordinary citizen as a result.

While I cited the statistics at Duke, I think the conditions are universal
within humanities departments in 99% of American universities and community
colleges.  There is probably less than 1% of English departments across the
nation that will vote Republican.  And so the dialogue gets increasingly unlike
the mainstream population which is more or less 50-50 in terms of voting at this
point.  The result is that those conservative students who do have to take
English classes develop vendettas when they see that they haven't got a single
voice among the English faculty who represent anything anwhere like what they
believe.

What conservatives are saying, especially neo-conservatives, is that democracy
must become a universal condition.  They point to misery indexes -- these are
supposed to be universal measurements of painful conditions within countries,
and all countries are ranked according to crimes per 100,000, conditions of
hygiene, longevity, and perhaps forty other indices (I'm not sure of them all).
The western European democracies, for instance, have double the longevity of
most sub-Saharan countries.  In terms of dental pain, for instance, 90% of
Moroccans report constant dental pain.  This level of pain is part of the misery
index.  by contrast the number of those experiencing chronic dental pain in
America is less than 1%.

Amartya Sen, a Nobel prize-winning economist, has argued that democratic
conditions are an indispensable precondition for a healthy economy, but that
these conditions also pay out in hundreds of different indexes, and that in fact
liberal democratic conditions are the basis for any kind of quality of life.  He
argues that freedom of speech is THE MOST important indicator of economic
growth, but also the biggest indicator of the lack of famine, dental pain, etc.,
within any given country.

When I'm speaking about functionality of a country, I too am loosely leaning on
the idea of a universal misery index.

What George Bowering said yesterday in regards to the death penalty for
juveniles being used by the Congo, Pakistan and the U.S. is actually what makes
the US about twentieth on the misery index.  What George didn't say however is
that we do have freedom of speech, quite good longevity, good hygiene, good
dental health (when you compare it to Morocco) etc.  Congo and Pakistan do not
share these good things.

Sen argues that it is not equality of income that matters in a given country
that will lead to prosperity, but equality of OPPORTUNITY.  Therefore, women
MUST HAVE equal access to opportunity, as must all minorities within a country.
Of course this is a fictional state of affairs -- but it HAS TO BE AIMED AT --
and this is actually one of the keystones of conservative logic for intervention
within the Islamic republics.

a.  There are at least a hundred thousand slaves within the southern Sudan that
are being kept by Islamic warlords

b.  Throughout the Islamic world there is not equality of opportunity for women
(even jogging has been banned, and women runners in the Olympics have had to
train outside their countries of origins for fear of public execution)

c.  Non-Islamic people in many of those countries do not have equal
opportunities

This is why the conservatives are actually picking up new recruits all the time
and the liberals are losing them.  The conservatives are actually talking about
human rights, and they are using this as an absolute standard.  This has a very
powerful appeal.

Sen writes that there has never been a democratic country that has EVER
experienced a famine.

Compare the Soviet Republics.

The neo-conservatives have very good ideas, and I don't see anybody in academia
who has ever even heard of these ideas.

People are busy reading Foucault for ideas, and come on, he knowingly gave AIDS
to young people, and this is in the biographies.  He's a non-starter.  On top of
that, he suggests that child molestation is no big deal in History of Sexuality
pp. 25-30.  This is not going to sail outside of the protected environment of
academia.  All the conservatives have the weaknesses of the liberals down pat.
They read their enemies.  And somehow the liberals are not reading conservatives
at all, and are getting creamed at the polls.

The best thing that poets can do is to read their enemies.

Is there anything to keep us from granting Iraq statehood?  Seems preferable
to colonizing it and they must have a media figure who could govern better
than S can or S can round up a posse to lasso the terrorists.

Robert Creeley & Jennifer Moxley
Robert Creeley is a New Englander by birth (1926) and disposition, although
he has spent most of his life in other parts of the world, including
Guatemala, British Columbia, France, and Spain. In the 1950s he taught at
Black Mountain College and also edited the Black Mountain Review, a crucial
gathering place for alternative senses of writing at that time. Charles
Olson (then Rector of the college), Robert Duncan and Edward Dorn are among
the company he met there. Subsequently, he taught at the University of New
Mexico and in 1966 went to the State University of New York at Buffalo,
where he was the first director of the Poetics Program, begun in 1990 with
colleagues Charles Bernstein, Susan Howe, Dennis Tedlock, and Raymond
Federman. In 2003 he joined Brown University=B9s Graduate Program in Creative
Writing as a Distinguished Professor of English. Although most identified a=
s
a poet (For Love, Pieces, Windows and Selected Poems being a few of his man=
y
collections), he has written a significant body of prose including a novel,
The Island, and a collection of stories, The Gold Diggers. His critical
writings are published in The Collected Essays of Robert Creeley and his
correspondence with Charles Olson is now in ten volumes and counting. He is
also known for the diversity of his collaborations with artists in other
media, having made records with two decisive jazz composer/musicians, the
bassist Steve Swallow (Home) and the saxophonist Steve Lacy (Futurities),
and collaborated with the alternative mix rock group Mercury Rev (The Hum i=
s
Coming from Her/So There). He has worked for more than three decades with
visual artists, including Robert Indiana, Jim Dine, R.B. Kitaj, Francesco
Clemente, John Chamberlain, Alex Katz, and Susan Rothenberg.
Jennifer Moxley is the author of Imagination Verses (Tender Buttons, 1996;
Salt, 2003) and The Sense Record (Edge, 2002; Salt, 2003). The latter was
selected by Small Press Traffic as one of the best poetry books of 2002. Sh=
e
is the poetry editor at The Baffler and a contributing editor to The Poker,
and works as an Assistant Professor of English at the University of Maine.

Hi all,

I'm writing to invite you to come see me and
Mytili Jagannathan read
from our new poetry collections on Friday, Nov.
21st as part of Small
Press Traffic's Fall reading series at CCAC in San
Francisco.  That's
the Friday before Thanksgiving;  it will be the
debut reading for my
new
book, "Rouge State," just out from Pavement Saw
Press.  Mytili is here
from Philadelphia to unveil her new chapbook ACTS,
the first
publication
from local poet David Hadbawnik's habenicht press.
Drinks to follow at
the Connecticut Yankee (just up from Bottom of the
Hill).  I'd love to
see you there!

Hooray,
Rodney

[DH amending Rodney's post to note: Mytili's book
is actually the THIRD title on habenicht press;
others are Curses and Other Love Poems by Sarah
Peters and The Ones I Used To Laugh With by Diane
di Prima. This is MYTILI's first book. and you can
read more about it at
www.habenichtpress.com ]
[Also: this might be the most interestingly named
double bill of poets you're likely to see this
year!]

MYTILI JAGANNATHAN was selected for a Pew
Fellowship in 2002; her work
has appeared in Xcp: Cross Cultural
Poetics, Combo, Interlope, and Mirage; and is
forthcoming in the
anthology "Cities of Chance: An Anthology of New
Poetry
from thw United States and Brazil."  She joins us
from Philadelphia in
celebration of the publication of her new chapbook

RODNEY KOENEKE was born in Omaha in 1968 and grew
up in Tucson and Los

Basic English in China, 1929-1979" (Stanford UP,
2003);  "Rouge State"
is his first full-length poetry collection.

"In Rouge State, Rodney Koeneke puts the blush
back on the demotic.
His
idiomatic montage is a careening screed dictated
from a state of alert,
all puns intended to turn the hose back on a
culture run literally
amuck, and whose marquee reads: Raw, Red, Rouge,
Incarnadine.  Welcome
to these states!"

written by Robert Browning having a sex change
operation.  There can be

squarely at the fissure where the simulacrul
Middle America of Pop
Warner and bubble top vans collides with a
paracolonial hallucination
of
Eastern inscrutability inhabited by five-dollar
houris and hack oud

7:30pm (potluck starts at 6:00 if anyone wants to endure my cooking)

Puerto Rico has been asked, and they said no.  Haiti was also asked, and
they too said no, in spite of all the economic benefits, and all that.
This was in the later 1800s (in the Haitian scenario) -- but I can't
remember exactly what date.

Fun idea, but they'd have to have a referendum and agree to form a
state, or at least that has been the protocol for Caribbean islands.

Attention all:

In a recent tech-dunce my e-mail server (graffiti.net) decided to take liberties with my addie list and thoroughly trashed all my contacts. I need to send info to all the contributors to ABMIT so I can send them copies.

Can anyone please send me the e-mails or addies of the following people. Thanks much.

Jane, Taylor,

Thanks very much for the e-mail/postal addies. I'm one step closer to sanesville.

Also: Ambit-Journal of Poetry & Poetics is finally finally finally pressed for proper distribution. If anyone would like a copy send me a note about subscriptions. I am very open to magazine trades also. The website furniturepress.net will also be up and running by December. I'll also have more info about our small presses/disparate poetic communities feature on the web, where we'll be building a forum/dialogue through the site plus have an on-line zine featuring poets from around the country. Details are slim now but imagine the possibilities. Anyone who wishes to contribute we are all yours.

Keep all ears to the ground, we're coming.

check out www.towson.edu/~cacasama/furniture/poae while we rebuild our home.

e-mail me at: furniture_press@graffiti.net

All my best to everyone,

Christophe

I do side with Tim on the CYBORGS statement and differ with Nick on TREES=microchips, to my taste trees are much more 'substational' and 'down-to-earth' than those funny-seeming nannos? in which our dialogues and poems appear to 'float'.

As far as getting 'ill' from one's reading, I just finished up O'Leary's Gnostic Contagion: Robert Duncan and the Poetry of Illness  and it's a hell of a great read that I think might confirm some of what your feeling Tim.  (I find it unlikely that Duncan would have approved much of 'blooggin'

Damn it Opal who are you?
None of the books tell it true.
There are a lot of people who might have sued.
Some say later you were arrogant and rude.
You might have made it up from leaves that were strewed.
You used did and do in ways that seemed really screwed.
Nothing about you seems to make sense except you were unglued.
Somewhere along the line you were glued and then you grewed.

Hey Tim, this is so beautifully put I find myself almost compelled to agree
with you. But where I don=B9t agree is that obviously listservs, books, films
and tv are just as =B3virtual=B2 as blogs. You have  not specified clearly wher=
e
blogs differ from these other media, but surely people are just as
essentially =B3personae=B2 on a theatrical stage, or in a classroom, or as an
author of a book or a poem or on a listserv as they are on a blog.

I do agree that listservs call for more direct dialog on particular topics,
and tend to be more interactive and confrontational. Our culture associates
confrontation with democracy, and particularly a very masculine form of
confrontation which tends to be argumentative and frequently in an
unpleasantly tiresome, repetitive, rambling, highly competitive and
quarrelsome way. This is called debate. Perhaps you=B9ve never noticed how fe=
w
women post to this list on a regular basis. This is because women- writers,
anyway,  appear to not enjoy as much and as frequently as men the
confrontational and competitive attitudes that have in the past supplied th=
e
flavor of much of this listserv. Present company happily excepted!

Ask yourself the question why there are so many women bloggers and why very
few women post regularly to this list. I have not found this list, in the
long range, to be communal in the way that you put it, not only because of
the absence of women, but because of the absence of any sense of process,
ongoing presence or project or ongoing continuity. While I agree that some
blogs lack depth, they almost always contain a sense of process and
ongoingness and ongoing presence of a writer and his or her ongoing
availability. You have to read them for a long time to notice how much
substantial dialogue does take place. Sometimes there are archives
immediately available on the blogger's site if you wish to read or reread
the blogger's writing in the past. You have to hang around long enough and
listen closely enough to have a feel for the "personas" and their
relationships. Hey, kind of like in "real" life. Whatever the hell that is
these days in Bush & Company's Us-And-Only-Us-Land.

Joel Kuzai, who had more interest in this list than anybody I am aware of,
and was the editor of "poetics@" (Roof Books), the only collection of
writing from this list I know about, once suggested that the list attempt t=
o
organize some ongoing projects. But I don=B9t think this list will ever do
this because its strength is its spontaneity. The list is like a group of
professors and students leaving a classroom and getting into a discussion o=
n
the way to getting some coffee or a drink. Sometimes everybody heads for th=
e
bar, and stays up late and jawbones and occasionally there is a nice,
friendly brawl. This is fine, but to valorize its democratic potential is
pushing it.

 After 9/11 I found this list to be a lifesaver. Barrett Watten and I
started a discussion here, but we realized we couldn=B9t continue it here. Th=
e
discussion had quickly gone onto other things. So he and I went onto other
things and places. It was subsequently published in Chain #9, by the way.

 Don=B9t get me wrong. I respect and enjoy this list. It has its virtues. But
to compare it unfavorably to blogging is like calling a rowboat more useful
than a car or an airplane. Yes, if you want to row across a lake the rowboa=
t
is by far the best means of transportation. And during the trip across the
lake the people in the boat have a nice chat. Then they head elsewhere. Thi=
s
is fine. But not if you want to travel more widely and for longer- and more
encompassing- journeys.

This is a good joke, Nick.  OK, so it's not a joke.  I'm just feeling
bleary and sour as I slog away here after hours while my two children
sleep.  I'm seizing this fuzzy opportunity to say that there are other
factors contributing to the relative silence of this woman on this list,
and others: sustained and constant interaction with small humans being
one of them--this type of interaction tends to be both time-consuming
and softening, and combined with a full-time job and a blazing urge to
write poetry leaves little energy left for anything but list one-liners
(in my case anyway).  But I've over-run my limit.  I *could* agree with
you (WOM-PO: very productive, rich list, majority of members are female;
poetryetc: present "bosses" are female but always has had a tradition of
communal projects) but
what the hell, I'll just be confrontational.

NYC
212-505-3360
www.kgbbar.com/
Take the 6 to Astor or Bleecker or the F to 2nd Avenue.

Renowned poet David Ray reads from his new memoir The Endless Search as part
of the KGB Nonfiction Series. Heartbreaking and moving without being overly
sentimental, Ray's account of his lifelong search for meaning is as
intensely personal and simultaneously universal as his best poetry. Here's a
chance to catch him in New York! For more information, see
http://www.davidraypoet.com

Richard Eoin Nash will be reading from his book The Organs of Emotion. In
this illustrated and award-winning collaboration between himself and
artist/designer Douglas Fitch, images and words collide, producing a frenzy
that escalates to the point where the book itself becomes a seizure.
Richard's writing has appeared in Maisonneuve, La Petite Zine, Pindeldyboz,
and in the anthology 110 Stories, among other places.

Victoria Slumlord Kimpton slammed in media
by Property is Theft •Friday November 14, 2003 at 07:03 AM

Missing beams, leaking sewer gas, no fire escapes, missing smoke alarms,
debris falling from ceiling. Tenants make the landlords rich while they
risk their lives.

Victoria Slumlord Kimpton slammed in media

Times Colonist, Friday, November 14, 2003
http://www.canada.com/victoria/timescolonist/story.asp?id=9BD4DCD5-6586-4DAF-91EC-8A7791CBC059

Tenants forced to move out of 1176 Yates St. after bylaw officers closed
the rooming house because of safety concerns. Inspectors found
weight-bearing beams in the basement had been cut and weight-bearing
posts had been undermined.

Upstairs, one weight-bearing wall had been removed entirely...  the
building is supposed to contain 17 light housekeeping suites without
bathrooms.

... there were open pipes in the house and sewer gas seeping into the
building. Inspectors also found electrical work that had been done
without permit and renovations in the attic where there is no fire
escape.

...another former tenant, complains  about ongoing construction late at
night, a leaky gas stove, the lack of a smoke detector, mice, and debris
falling from the ceiling.

Property records indicated the building is owned by Robin Kimpton, but
neither he nor his lawyer were available for comment Thursday.

But in a letter to building inspector Dave Marchment earlier this week,
Kimpton asks for him to explain "why this drastic step of no occupancy
has been taken."

In the letter, which is filed at city hall, Kimpton notes that
approximately 15 tenants have had to vacate the building. "We have
managed to move a lot of the tenants to other buildings. We have offered
them one month's free rent and we have actually done the moving for
them."

Kimpton also states that there have been three break-ins or attempted
break-ins since the posting, and that he is very concerned about the
risk of vandalism. As a result, he intends to remove valuable assets
such a fridges and stoves, the letter says.

Scoones said Kimpton is required to board up the building to prevent
illegal occupation.

Kimpton owns three other properties in Victoria, at 1301 Gladstone Ave.,
1349 Grant St. and 2321 Cook St.

... all three are listed with the city as "properties of concern."

Kimpton also owns two properties in Vancouver at 1696 West 11th Ave. and
1936 West 14th Ave., which is also listed as his residence on B.C.
Assessment records.

Nick, I agree with most of what you say here, and I respect your love for=20
blogs and all your work on behalf of them. However, I think that collapsing=
=20
distinctions by making the argument that all writing/reading has a virtual=
=20
component or that all writing/reading is inherently performative gloss over=
=20
the fact that there are very significant differences in the type and degree=
=20
of performances being enacted, as well as their social usefulness. Two of=20
the most significant differences about blogs, as I mentioned before, are=20
speed and accessibility, combined with an assumption (in most cases) that=20
the writer and author are the same person, so centralized speed and=20
accessibility. I find blogs fascinating and also strange because their=20
relationship to public language is askew -- in many cases it appears that=20
they are speaking to no one in particular, playing no recognizable=20
"language games," so the question of solipsism arises for me, as for=20
friends of mine who have stopped or taken a hiatus from blogging because=20
they feel that "no one's listening." I think you are a wonderful exception=
=20
to this trend, as you are very supportive of and responsive to other=20
bloggers, and I do sense that the group dynamic matters to you. However, I=
=20
think this is the exception rather than the rule, so far at least.

I mean, I respect bloggers, but I guess I want to make the point that the=20
medium is not for everybody. I can't see why, as you suggest, I might want=
=20
to read someone's poetic thinking-out-loud (however insightful it may be)=20
on their blog consistently, every day until I get to know them, when I=20
spend enough of my life as it is having endless conversations with people=20
who talk only about themselves. I'm interested in something more=
 cooperative.

There have been many comparisons between blogging and historical instances=
=20
of diary writing. I also find these comparisons unconvincing, for the=20
similar reason that they collapse important distinctions. Blogging is not a=
=20
diary, it's a diary where everyone's listening, a diary where immediacy, a=
=20
demographically-posited reader (witness: sitemeters), and the distance over=
=20
space that the poem traverses become potential replacements for the=20
classical space of time and an anticipated future reader troped by much=20
modernist poetry since Baudelaire. But while the medium depends so much=20
upon the fact that "everyone's watching," in a way "no one's listening."=20
The presence of this pervasive blog reader is simultaneously omnipresent=20
and ghostly. I don't know about you, but I simply can't be honest with=20
myself in front of such an audience. It's not so much a fertile writing=20
situation to me as it is a kind of poetic purgatory.

I might also posit the question: is it not just as masculine, or more=20
masculine, to centralize discourse in a localized site devoted mostly to=20
one's "self" and the movements of one's own mind? Do not poets use blogs to=
=20
create certain hierarchies and sub-hierarchies that impact our social=20
realities as poets, people, and friends, just as they do in other media? Do=
=20
not we have an effect on other people (be they bloggers or not) and vice=20
versa, which is influenced by this medium? When I go up to a friend and ask=
=20
"How are you?" and that friend says "Well, did you read my blog?" is this=20
not a little worrisome?

As far as blogs themselves go, I think the group blog As/Is=20
(http://as-is.blogspot.com) provides a good solution to many of the issues=
=20
I'm discussing, one drawback being that it moves so FAST that to keep up I=
=20
imagine I would have to do nothing else for several days straight. But I=20
initially found and still find it quite exciting as a project.

All Best,

Tim

Tim

Hey Tim, this is so beautifully put I find myself almost compelled to agree=
=20
with you. But where I don=B9t agree is that obviously listservs, books,=
 films=20
and tv are just as =B3virtual=B2 as blogs. You have not specified clearly=
 where=20
blogs differ from these other media, but surely people are just as=20
essentially =B3personae=B2 on a theatrical stage, or in a classroom, or as=
 an=20
author of a book or a poem or on a listserv as they are on a blog.
I do agree that listservs call for more direct dialog on particular topics,=
=20
and tend to be more interactive and confrontational. Our culture associates=
=20
confrontation with democracy, and particularly a very masculine form of=20
confrontation which tends to be argumentative and frequently in an=20
unpleasantly tiresome, repetitive, rambling, highly competitive and=20
quarrelsome way. This is called debate. Perhaps you=B9ve never noticed how=
=20
few women post to this list on a regular basis. This is because women-=20
writers, anyway, appear to not enjoy as much and as frequently as men the=20
confrontational and competitive attitudes that have in the past supplied=20
the flavor of much of this listserv. Present company happily excepted!
Ask yourself the question why there are so many women bloggers and why very=
=20
few women post regularly to this list. I have not found this list, in the=20
long range, to be communal in the way that you put it, not only because of=
=20
the absence of women, but because of the absence of any sense of process,=20
ongoing presence or project or ongoing continuity. While I agree that some=
=20
blogs lack depth, they almost always contain a sense of process and=20
ongoingness and ongoing presence of a writer and his or her ongoing=20
availability. You have to read them for a long time to notice how much=20
substantial dialogue does take place. Sometimes there are archives=20
immediately available on the blogger's site if you wish to read or reread=20
the blogger's writing in the past. You have to hang around long enough and=
=20
listen closely enough to have a feel for the "personas" and their=20
relationships. Hey, kind of like in "real" life. Whatever the hell that is=
=20
these days in Bush & Company's Us-And-Only-Us-Land.
Joel Kuzai, who had more interest in this list than anybody I am aware of,=
=20
and was the editor of "poetics@" (Roof Books), the only collection of=20
writing from this list I know about, once suggested that the list attempt=20
to organize some ongoing projects. But I don=B9t think this list will ever=
 do=20
this because its strength is its spontaneity. The list is like a group of=20
professors and students leaving a classroom and getting into a discussion=20
on the way to getting some coffee or a drink. Sometimes everybody heads for=
=20
the bar, and stays up late and jawbones and occasionally there is a nice,=20
friendly brawl. This is fine, but to valorize its democratic potential is=20
pushing it.
After 9/11 I found this list to be a lifesaver. Barrett Watten and I=20
started a discussion here, but we realized we couldn=B9t continue it here.=

KGB

Last evening, Lynda and I wandered over to the KGB Bar on E. 4th St. for
a reading.  4th St.'s eastern terminus is just a few blocks from where we live,
so we, going and coming, walked along that street, both of us, looking at
building numbers, realized after all these NYC years that below Washington
Square Park it's Broadway that divides streets east and west. It was our first
visit to the KGB (http://www.kgbbar.com/), which has an interesting history,
if not as long a one as some NYC watering spots. For more info, check out
(http://www.kgbbar.com/about.shtml). There's an anthology of KGB Bar
fiction (http://www.kgbbar.com/anthology.shtml), and also one of poems
(ed. David Lehman and Star Black) that doesn't seem to have won a place
on the bar's website as yet. (Well, it only came out in 2000.)

        The KGB (Komitet Gosudarstvennoi Bezopasnosti, or The
        Committee for State Security) was the name of the main Soviet
        external security and intelligence agency, as well as the main secret police
        agency from March 13, 1954 to November 6, 1991. The KGB's
        domain was roughly that of the American CIA and the counter-
        intelligence division of the FBI.

The bar is upstairs on the second floor, and its windows, which look like
they've never been cleaned--ever--look out over E. 4th St. at another
bar, this one just called BAR, according to its sign (much more brightly
prominent than the KGB sign). The interior decor is, as you'd expect,
burnished wood and red-painted walls, with KGB, Cold War-USSR
images and icons here and there--and, more surprisingly, Art Nouveau
hanging lamps, sconces and back-lit stained-glass shelf doors above the bar.

We took our seats in the farthest corner of the room (only one room here,
it seemed) by the western-most of the windows looking down on 4th St.
My back was to the wall, and Lynda's, until the readings began, was to
the lectern just a couple tables away, over toward the bar. Our glasses
of red wine cost six bucks, though we weren't required to buy anything,
or pay anything to get in.

The readers were father and daughter, and I pretty much managed not
to hear most of what they read. I guess, in my head, I was starting to write
this. The father read first, from a novella he'd written back in the late 70s--
something to do with a nut case out camping and then being picked up and
driven home by his mother. He didn't read all of it, but read three sections--
the beginning, something from the middle, and the end--summarizing the parts
he didn't read. There were some tepidly quirky bits, but, on the whole, as
I later joked to Lynda on our way home, I rather preferred the summaries.

        In March of 1953, Lavrenty Beria united the MVD and MGB into
        one body, the MVD. Within a year, Beria was executed and the
        MVD was split up. The reformed MVD retained its internal security
        functions while the new KGB took on external security functions. The
        KGB was subordinated to the Council of Ministers. On July 5, 1978
        the KGB was renamed the "KGB of the USSR" with the KGB Chairman
        given a seat on the council.

The second reader, the daughter, was younger and prettier, of course. She
read with her mouth an inch or less from the mike, and thus her initial p's,
b's, t's, etc. popped into the mike and exploded from the speakers hung
on two walls of the bar. Her story was from 1996 or thereabout, and (I
never could tell whether this was deliberate or not) was also about a camping
trip. She graciously claimed her story was not as good as her dad's, and noted
that hers involved her main character's meeting with a couple, as her dad's
did not. Her prose style, like her initial consonants, tended to pop--bits of
humor and 90s details studding a story I couldn't manage to follow, the humor,
at least a couple times, involving (if that's the word) Lance Armstrong's
missing balls (or was it ball).

        The KGB was dissolved due to the participation of its chief, Colonel
        General Vladimir Kryuchkov, in the August 1991 coup attempt designed
        to overthrow Mikhail Gorbachev. He used many of the KGB's resources
        to aid the coup attempt. Kryuchkov was arrested, and General Vadim
        Bakatin was appointed Chairman on August 23, 1991 with a mandate to
        dismantle the KGB. On November 6, 1991 the Russian KGB officially
        ceased to exist, though its successor organization, the Federalnaya Sluzhba
        Bezopasnosti, or FSB, is functionally extremely similar to the KGB. Belarus
        is the only post-Soviet society where the successor organization continues
        to be called the KGB. Belarus is also where one of the founders of the
        KGB, Felix Dzerzhinsky — who was born in a town now within Belarusian
        territory — remains a national hero.

Lynda'd known these folks--father, daughter, divorced mother (who still lives
in our building and who sat with us through the first half of the reading)--so the
younger reader was someone who'd grown up knowing Lynda's kids. And here
she was, all grown up, with a husband and major-publisher book of her own.

Look, it's not that I have something against readings. Nowadays, it's that I seem
to have more and more against them. My wine glowed redly when I held the glass
up in front of the candle on the table. The window to my right was so dirty it wasn't
hard to imagine Soviet Moscow out there, mysterious figures emerging from the dim
recesses of cheery bars--where, happily, no readings were going on--pulling their
caps down over their eyes and vanishing from sight on somewhat furtive missions.

Sonnet:   How Are Things Going?

How are things really going in Idaho? A tricky question, at first, inherently
difficult to answer in terms of counterinsurgency warfare
and nation-building efforts. Small trees (and large) blown down,
their "client areas" damaging roofs and garage, cars parked in driveways.

Highly partisan debate dominates the breakfast-table chatter, the latest
violence there, beyond the window for all to see, impossible to ignore.
More than 50 neighbors affected by this latest storm, this newest trend dom-
inating news coverage for miles around, overshadowing more in-depth

analysis based on government information. Of course, this being war,
the rivers remain largely fluid, despite our best efforts to get a fix on them.
New charts shed light on evolving situations, and that's better than
nothing, let me tell you--better than a filtration system that no longer works.

Winning Idaho hearts and minds, and lowering crime rates in general, remain
our goals, even with water services at 80 percent of pre-war levels.

Kirby: The tendency to off conservatives? You mean that there's hiring
discrimination against conservatives? It's been a long time since I went
thru the interview process--I don't remember any opportunity to have even
expressed my politics. Or do you mean that conservatives don't get tenure
because of their politics? I know of one recent tenure crisis in which a
candidate was denied because his having written on Gramsci seemed to a
committee member a sure indicator that he was a communist, and I do
remember a red scare and a blacklist. But not their opposite.

See, I had just assumed, along with all the pollsters, that the better
educated one is the more likely one is to vote Democratic (which I'm aware
is not the same as being liberal, but it's the best poll indicator we've
got). Which would also mean that the pool of applicants for university jobs
would be overwhelmingly liberal. The better informed tend to vote liberal.
This is also true of working journalists, tho not of their bosses, who have
other fish to fry.

But maybe to even things out there should be affirmative action for
conservatives. Whoops, the courts might not like that one. How about
appointment by nomination of local legislators, as in applications for the
service academies?

Actually, it's hard for me to imagine that most liberals, even if they read
Foucault, are unaware of conservative opinion. Duke, which you mention, for
instance, is located in a liberal town surrounded by North Carolina. Did
Jesse Helms, to know the enemy, read Foucault?

But this is frivolous--given current laws there's probably no way to change
the ideological balance in university faculties short of brain implants.

So let's do a quick test of your other hypotheses. What if, to correct for
variables like modern technology, infrastructure, and which countries got
to the trough first, we look at the past? Would the differential in favor
of the more democratic countries still be true? Was the misery index in
early industrial England lower than in other places? How about the
exporting of misery, as in the potato famine?  Or genocide, as in
rambunctiously democratic 19th century America?

Even in the present the hypothesis is questionable. Who decides which
countries are democracies? (As in that other wonderful neocon argument,
that democracies never invade other democracies. Tell that one to Chileans,
Guatemalans, Cubans) If India is a democracy how do we account for its
misery and occasional famines?

Famines, like other calamities, are usually local events. Manner of
governance doesn't control rainfall and flood. Famine relief is easier in
countries that span many climatic regions and have efficient transport
systems, which is why the massive crop failures in the nascent farm and
ranch lands of the US in the first decades of the last century didn't cause
a local famine--the population could get elsewhere quickly, and supplies
could come in.

In the present, would you argue that the US is less democratic than Western
Europe because it's higher on the misery index? (Not, by the way, because
of the death penalty, but because of our medical system, literacy rate,
infant mortality rate, etc.). How about our tendency to overthrow regimes
in countries whose democratic choices don't suit our needs, and the misery
that causes?

Democracy is a wonderful thing, altho it tends to work better if citizens
read newspapers, any newspapers, rather than forming their opinions based
on what they hear on the radio, any radio, on the way to work, or if they
don't vote as they're told to from the pulpit, or for that matter if they
at least vote. It also tends to work better if the populace spends less
time comparing its condition to that of more miserable countries and more
time in criticism of the failings of its own country. Such criticism is not
the same as preferring Saddam Hussein.

But let's assume that Sen (who did not win a Nobel prize for his political
opinions, which are as irrelevant to that process as the color of his
socks) is right and that a US purified of ulterior motives should
work--fight--towards universal democracy. The question is, as always, how
many eggs it's ok to break. Even if we had won in Vietnam and subsequent to
victory had managed to convince the rulers we had installed in Saigon that
they should care about their country's misery index, there still would have
been 3 million broken eggs, not to mention widows, orphans and the maimed.
And we continue to break eggs in Iraq, tho we've learned that it's better
not to count. The calculation of misery, if there were no other motives at
play, would surely have to take this into account.

Mark,

I'd agree with most of what you've written here, but I did want to draw
attention to the following:

>Famines, like other calamities, are usually local events=2E Manner of=20
>governance doesn't control rainfall and flood=2E Famine relief is easier =
in=20
>countries that span many climatic regions and have efficient transport=20=

>a local famine--the population could get elsewhere quickly, and supplies=20=

>could come in=2E

While at the most literal level this is probably true, it misses what I
think is an essential political-economic dynamic of the last several
centuries of world history=2E In brief, I think it might be more accurate =
to
say that, at least since the advent of the British Empire, famines have
often been imperial, and later global, events=2E Witness the huge role tha=
t
cash-cropping for export and the liquidation of communal grain stores
played in almost all of the major Indian famines from the 18th C=2E onward=
s=2E
While the decision to switch from grain-as-subsistence to
grain-as-cash-on-the-barrelhead had its most severe ramifications
"locally," the decision itself was never a local one, originating as it di=
d
with various agencies and subcontrators of the empire=2E (Later, of course=
,
it's the even-further delocalized abstraction of the "global market" that
plays this role)=2E One could make similar observations about China, Brazi=
l
and probably much of Africa and the Middle East=2E (The role of cotton in
Egypt, e=2Eg=2E)

Some of this is just nit-picking, probably, but I think in a way it gets a=
t
a crucial ideological distortion in these various correlations of "misery
indices" and democratic governance -- namely, the inability of almost all
of this neo-con "common sense" to deal with the continuing legacies of
colonialism and the present global realities of uneven development=2E

Hey Taylor, great post---

One could also make similar observations in an analogous fashion that would
help explain the recent NY TIMES headline (yesterday, I think) about the
Albanians who are trading their children for televisions.
"Children" as a kind of "cash-on-the-barrelhead" might, as a graphic
example, help to drive this imperial (excuse me, global market) dynamic home

Agreed.  Monocroppng is bad for all sorts of reasons.

The point I was trying to make was much simpler, and in no way conradicts
yours: if there's a will to avert famine it will be easier to act on if
there's a railroad (and political continuity) between the endangered region
and one that's less endangered.

Unofficial Poet Laureate1 of Los Angeles and CSUN1s

Phenomenal Woman Debuts New Poems


 OSTINATO VAMPS, a new collection of poems by Emmy award-winning writer,

poet and journalist, WANDA COLEMAN was published this fall by University
of

Pittsburgh Press as part of its 2003 Pitt Poetry Series. Their series of

authors not only includes Billy Collins, Poet Laureate of the United
States,

but much noted African-American poets Etheridge Knight and Michael S.

Weaver. Considered a literary underground cult figure, COLEMAN has
gained

considerable mainstream attention  recently. OSTINATO VAMPS is not

violent eruptions of beauty

her

long-time publishing house became the Black Sparrow Books imprint of
David

Last

month, COLEMAN celebrated this new collection at the invitation of the

Women1s Studies Department at California State University, Northridge,
as

part of the Phenomenal Women Distinguished Lecture. COLEMAN was selected
by

students and faculty over four other accomplished candidates competing
for

the award, all women who are Southern California residents gifted in the

arts, humanities or sciences and deserving of recognition. COLEMAN was

featured reader in November for UCLA1s Friends of English. Her new

collection echoes her electric poetic trademarks: prayers for ultimate

social justice, portraits of family members and the disenfranchised
urban

poor, evocations of lost loved ones, and musical verses COLEMAN calls

"jazzifications." Her peers have called COLEMAN "The L.A. Blueswoman,"

Timberg, and Dana Gioia, director of the National Endowment for The
Arts. In

Los

--------------------
Excerpt:=20
From Michael Bednar
Department of History
The University of Texas at Austin
Congress Moves to Regulate Postcolonial Studies (fwd)

Oct. 20, 2003
Friends,

As many of you who know me well will soon realize, I have become a =
political
activist for the first time in my life. I am not here to rant, but to =
inform
you on current legislation that is being debated in the House of
Representatives. The legislation in question, H.R. 3077, will rew-rite =
the
Title VI legislation that has provided FLAS money to many of us and that
also funds the various area-studies centers in our universities. In
particular, the legislation proposes the creation of an "advisory board"
that may severely impact universities by dictating the
curricula taught, course materials assigned in class, and the faculty =
who
are hired in institutions that accept Title VI funding. It gets worse.=20

The U.S. House of Representative's Subcommittee on Select Education =
Hearing
on "International Programs in Higher Education and Questions about Bias" =
on
June 19,
2003(http://edworkforce.house.gov/hearings/108th/sed/titlevi61903/wl61903=
.ht
m) begins with an opening statement by Representative Phil Gringrey that
includes the following passage: "we are here today to learn more about a
number of programs that are authorized and funded under Title VI, which =
are
some of the oldest programs of support to higher education. These =
programs
reflect the priority placed by the federal government on diplomacy, =
national
security, and trade competitiveness. International
studies and education have become an increasingly important and relevant
topic of conversation and consideration in higher education...However, =
with
mounting global tensions, some programs under the Higher Education Act =
that
support foreign language and area studies centers have recently =
attracted
national attention and concern due to the perception of their teachings =
and
policies." Testimony provided by Dr. Stanley Kurtz (available from the =
link
above) portrays areas studies centers as hotbeds of unpatriotic
anti-Americanism. Dr. Kurtz focuses, in particular, on
post-colonial theory and the work of Edward Said's Orientalism in which
"Said equated professors who support American foreign policy with the =
19th
century European intellectuals who propped up racist colonial empires.

Is this real? Can anyone verify the authenticity of these extremely
disturbing claims? If true, it is another bit of evidence that little =
was
learned from the McCarthy years and that the US is entering just another
phase of the same turn of events. Perhaps it's the time of day, but I =
feel
I'm gradually waking up into a nightmare.

Thanks,

Dear McPoetry fans,


I wrote/performed this piece in Hollywood back in the pre-slam 80's,
then transcribed it for my website 3 years ago.
It's a 4 part poem entitled "Godzilla."

The mcPoetry reference in part 3 is here:

http://www.home.earthlink.net/~barleydog/godzilla3.html



And the poem (beginning with part 1) is here:

http://www.home.earthlink.net/~barleydog/godzilla3.html


Enjoy,

David Braden

With all due respect, Tim, I don't understand what you are getting at
with
these comments. You have every right to express your feelings of
sickness
when you read, and how you are sure that that proves something to your
satisfaction, but how do you get from "people who seem enamored with the
idea  of being cyborgs" ...and "when I spend an hour or two online
blogging,
reading blogs or online journals...I begin  to feel ill" to "...there's
something missing there..." What does blogging have to do with cyborgs?
Do
you also get sick when you read books and journals? One medium is
electronic, the books and magazines are made from trees. Both involve
people's writing. Very frequently the same people who read and write
books
and articles also read and write blogs and pieces in online journals.



Best wishes,
Nick

Subject: young writers workshop final report

On Saturday morning the future giants of St. John's writing met for
another installment of Kevin Hehir's Exploding Language Writing
Workshop.
The 12 participants discussed how the Aristotelian narrative arc no
longer
effectively mimes our every day discourse so should be discarded in
favour
of the jab and parry that fragmentary storytelling affords writers in
the
post-media milieu that surrounds us therefore offering an increased
level
of sophistication and book sales. If, as post-structuralist, continental
thinker Michel Serres tells us, time is akin to pure light as poured
through a colander. Then, what happens when a weather channel poetics is
pushed down a playground slide into the waiting jaws of serial
toboggany?
Then we talked about Hegel's Bagels as a possible position on an axis of
names for synthetic breakfast foods. In theory, wholesome but praxis has
proved that they hurt the molars. [The mandible rhizome that reveals
itself through the sliding continuum of jaw-molar was not lost on one
young poet with a fresh nick on his chin from a 23 cent disposable
razor].
Then we ate muffins and made fun of our parents.

Subject: Re: McDonald's not lovin' 'McJob' dictionary definition

I had vague memories of a creative writing professor (maybe a McCreative
Writing Professor?) writing a McPoem (yes, that's the title) about 25
years
ago. Not sure of the ethics, copyright & otherwise of posting it here
without his permission, and he's not someone I know well or am in
contact
with. But since I found it this morning on his web site, I thought I'd
post
a link to it. I remember hating this poem ages ago; now, if I read it
with
a biting irony, as in Charles Bernstein's recent poem, "Thank You for
Saying Thank You" (although I think the irony in that poem is
complicated,
with many of the statements being absolutely straightforward) in his
chapbook, *Let's Just Say,* I don't dislike it at all. But I don't think
such irony is intended here.

It's by Ron Wallace.

From:    Tim Peterson <tpeterso@MIT.EDU>
Subject: 2 sputtering questions

Nick, in this case I think it's very much an issue of "the medium is the
message" -- there is something fundamentally different about the
activity
of blogging and reading blogs from say, reading a journal or a book.
Perhaps what I'm talking about here is the conflation of the blog with
its
author or writer -- the blog being a kind of virtual extension of the
self
that is potentially exciting, potentially worrying. I'm tempted to bring
up
Kent Johnson's critiques of authorship, but I will simply gesture at
those.
I guess what I'm saying is that, In a way, blogs form an incomplete map
of
the social sphere and project this virtual map back onto the real in a
way
that I think is fairly new for poetry, at least. The other thing that's
new
about it is 1)speed and 2)accessibility. As several frames run in
succession appear to create the motion of a film, so a series of
frequent
blog entries contributes to the creation of a virtual person who is
fundamentally different from a real person, more mercurial somehow,
while
also evoking and limited to all the paradoxes of textuality or textual
speech. As an easy example: a blog is not a listserv -- the two function
in
very different ways, and I would posit that a listserv actually allows
for
a more communal, democratic discussion.

Best,

Tim

(Has anyone experienced this first hand?  mIEKAL)

   "Nissan Motors is planting actors in movie theaters to perform live
   commercials before the start of showings of 'The Matrix
   Revolutions' in an effort to expose jaded, skeptical consumers to
   advertising by masking it as something else. The brief in-person
   pitches feature actors scattered among the ticket-buying audience
   who stand and deliver lines that evoke the words spoken by poets at
   events known as slams or jams. Their performances are timed to
   accompany a commercial the audience sees on the movie screen, which
   begins without identifying the sponsor but concludes with the
   Nissan Altima logo. The campaign by the Nissan North America
   division of Nissan Motor, intended to pique the curiosity of
   younger consumers about the Nissan Altima sedan, began yesterday in
   theaters operated by the Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corporation
   in seven large markets and is scheduled to continue through
   tomorrow."

>  =20
>   Notions of structure also come into play in Internet
>   publishing: Whole new models of poetry can be realized on the
>   Web -- hypertextual ones, for example, in which the reader>=20
>   need not begin at the first word of the first line and end at
>   the last word, but can enter the text at any point, exit at
>   any time, and thread a unique path through the text each time
>   it is visited. Shankar cites the Electronic Poetry Center at
>   the State University of New York at Buffalo
>   (http://epc.buffalo.edu), Riding the Meridian
>   (http://www.heelstone.com), Click Poetry
>   (http://www.clickpoetry.com), and Poems That Go
>   (http://www.poemsthatgo.com) as particularly exciting sites
>   specializing in poetry written expressly for the Web. Those
>   locations allow contributing poets to append moving images,
>   sounds, photographs, links, and other poems to their own work,
>   creating, as Shankar says, "a new kind of poet, a multimedia
>   bard who splices verse with audio landscapes, with the
>   juxtaposition of visual clips, and with the interaction and
>   full participation of the reader." Readers who visit these
>   experimental and media-poetry sites can look forward to
>   engaging with dynamic work that capitalizes on video,
>   hyperlinks, digital animation, gaming, and even mathematical
>   algorithms.
>  =20
>   These interactive, hypertextual sites might challenge readers
>   accustomed to print formats, or in some cases even make them a
>   little seasick. On recent visits to Click Poetry and Poems
>   That Go, I found an exuberant range of experiential poems,
>   some of which I could appreciate easily and others of which
>   challenged me technologically -- pieces whose dissolving and
>   surfacing texts and images, and whose opening, closing,
>   flashing, and disappearing and reappearing windows and prompts
>   made me wish for a better computer, sexier monitor, faster
>   modem, and less balky mouse. Some of David Knoebel's click
>   poems are pure fun, however, and put me in mind of surrealist
>   games -- an important reminder that notions of chance,
>   coincidence, serendipity, and irrationality are not unique
>   byproducts of interactive, cyberbased poetry, but have always
>   been crucial to the sensibilities of a great many poets such
>   as Breton and Mallarme. Deena Larsen's hypertextual
>   video-poetry piece "Firefly" in a recent issue of Poems That
>   Go is a remarkably luminous, lyrical, and haunting example of
>   ways in which multidimensional uses of reader-interactive text
>   and subtext can create a new kind of poem.
>  =20
>   In contrast, Jon Thompson, editor of the impressive and
>   more-traditional Web poetry journal Free Verse
>   (http://english.chass.ncsu.edu/freeverse), takes a restrained
>   approach to format. "Beyond the design of the home page and
>   the journal's logo," Thompson says, "I prefer not to use too
>   many visuals. For me, a lot of images detract from the power
>   of poetry itself -- its form on the page and its voice. I
>   prefer not to drown that out."
>  =20
>   The space Free Verse creates for each poem is uncluttered and
>   intimate, and though Thompson may choose a cleaner, quieter
>   format for his presentation than do other, busier sites, the
>   work he publishes is daring and strong. The winter 2002 issue,
>   for example, contained a special feature, Exilic Voices: Four
>   Iraqi Poets in Translation, including these lines from the
>   poem "Vacant City" by Mahmud al-Buraykan, translated by Salih

Subject: Re: Congo

Jason Christie --

Your post was quite welcome.  As we only get two posts a day (a good
idea, too,
I think), I wasn't able to respond yesterday.  I liked the tone of your
post,
and many of the points that you made.  What concerns me in academia is
the
tendency to off conservatives.  This has led to a situation in which
there are
only three self-reported conservatives among 450 humanities faculty for
instance
at Duke University.  This is supposed to make students more amenable to
leftist
programming.  What it has done however is create conditions in which the
academic left is increasingly out of touch with the mainstream of
America as
they have silenced those voices from ever reaching them.  As a result,
they
don't know what the right is saying, and they are getting killed in the
hearts
and minds of the ordinary citizen as a result.

While I cited the statistics at Duke, I think the conditions are
universal
within humanities departments in 99% of American universities and
community
colleges.  There is probably less than 1% of English departments across
the
nation that will vote Republican.  And so the dialogue gets increasingly
unlike
the mainstream population which is more or less 50-50 in terms of voting
at this
point.  The result is that those conservative students who do have to
take
English classes develop vendettas when they see that they haven't got a
single
voice among the English faculty who represent anything anwhere like what
they
believe.

What conservatives are saying, especially neo-conservatives, is that
democracy
must become a universal condition.  They point to misery indexes --
these are
supposed to be universal measurements of painful conditions within
countries,
and all countries are ranked according to crimes per 100,000, conditions
of
hygiene, longevity, and perhaps forty other indices (I'm not sure of
them all).
The western European democracies, for instance, have double the
longevity of
most sub-Saharan countries.  In terms of dental pain, for instance, 90%
of
Moroccans report constant dental pain.  This level of pain is part of
the misery
index.  by contrast the number of those experiencing chronic dental pain
in
America is less than 1%.

Amartya Sen, a Nobel prize-winning economist, has argued that democratic
conditions are an indispensable precondition for a healthy economy, but
that
these conditions also pay out in hundreds of different indexes, and that
in fact
liberal democratic conditions are the basis for any kind of quality of
life.  He
argues that freedom of speech is THE MOST important indicator of
economic
growth, but also the biggest indicator of the lack of famine, dental
pain, etc.,
within any given country.

When I'm speaking about functionality of a country, I too am loosely
leaning on
the idea of a universal misery index.

What George Bowering said yesterday in regards to the death penalty for
juveniles being used by the Congo, Pakistan and the U.S. is actually
what makes
the US about twentieth on the misery index.  What George didn't say
however is
that we do have freedom of speech, quite good longevity, good hygiene,
good
dental health (when you compare it to Morocco) etc.  Congo and Pakistan
do not
share these good things.

Sen argues that it is not equality of income that matters in a given
country
that will lead to prosperity, but equality of OPPORTUNITY.  Therefore,
women
MUST HAVE equal access to opportunity, as must all minorities within a
country.
Of course this is a fictional state of affairs -- but it HAS TO BE AIMED
AT --
and this is actually one of the keystones of conservative logic for
intervention
within the Islamic republics.

a.  There are at least a hundred thousand slaves within the southern
Sudan that
are being kept by Islamic warlords

b.  Throughout the Islamic world there is not equality of opportunity
for women
(even jogging has been banned, and women runners in the Olympics have
had to
train outside their countries of origins for fear of public execution)

c.  Non-Islamic people in many of those countries do not have equal
opportunities

This is why the conservatives are actually picking up new recruits all
the time
and the liberals are losing them.  The conservatives are actually
talking about
human rights, and they are using this as an absolute standard.  This has
a very
powerful appeal.

Sen writes that there has never been a democratic country that has EVER
experienced a famine.

Compare the Soviet Republics.

The neo-conservatives have very good ideas, and I don't see anybody in
academia
who has ever even heard of these ideas.

People are busy reading Foucault for ideas, and come on, he knowingly
gave AIDS
to young people, and this is in the biographies.  He's a non-starter.
On top of
that, he suggests that child molestation is no big deal in History of
Sexuality
pp. 25-30.  This is not going to sail outside of the protected
environment of
academia.  All the conservatives have the weaknesses of the liberals
down pat.
They read their enemies.  And somehow the liberals are not reading
conservatives
at all, and are getting creamed at the polls.

The best thing that poets can do is to read their enemies.

Subject: statehood for Iraq

Is there anything to keep us from granting Iraq statehood?  Seems
preferable
to colonizing it and they must have a media figure who could govern
better
than S can or S can round up a posse to lasso the terrorists.

Robert Creeley & Jennifer Moxley
Robert Creeley is a New Englander by birth (1926) and disposition,
although
he has spent most of his life in other parts of the world, including
Guatemala, British Columbia, France, and Spain. In the 1950s he taught
at
Black Mountain College and also edited the Black Mountain Review, a
crucial
gathering place for alternative senses of writing at that time. Charles
Olson (then Rector of the college), Robert Duncan and Edward Dorn are
among
the company he met there. Subsequently, he taught at the University of
New
Mexico and in 1966 went to the State University of New York at Buffalo,
where he was the first director of the Poetics Program, begun in 1990
with
colleagues Charles Bernstein, Susan Howe, Dennis Tedlock, and Raymond
Federman. In 2003 he joined Brown University=B9s Graduate Program in
Creative
Writing as a Distinguished Professor of English. Although most
identified a=
s
a poet (For Love, Pieces, Windows and Selected Poems being a few of his
man=
y
collections), he has written a significant body of prose including a
novel,
The Island, and a collection of stories, The Gold Diggers. His critical
writings are published in The Collected Essays of Robert Creeley and his
correspondence with Charles Olson is now in ten volumes and counting. He
is
also known for the diversity of his collaborations with artists in other
media, having made records with two decisive jazz composer/musicians,
the
bassist Steve Swallow (Home) and the saxophonist Steve Lacy
(Futurities),
and collaborated with the alternative mix rock group Mercury Rev (The
Hum i=
s
Coming from Her/So There). He has worked for more than three decades
with
visual artists, including Robert Indiana, Jim Dine, R.B. Kitaj,
Francesco
Clemente, John Chamberlain, Alex Katz, and Susan Rothenberg.
Jennifer Moxley is the author of Imagination Verses (Tender Buttons,
1996;
Salt, 2003) and The Sense Record (Edge, 2002; Salt, 2003). The latter
was
selected by Small Press Traffic as one of the best poetry books of 2002.
Sh=
e
is the poetry editor at The Baffler and a contributing editor to The
Poker,
and works as an Assistant Professor of English at the University of
Maine.

Puerto Rico has been asked, and they said no.  Haiti was also asked, and
they too said no, in spite of all the economic benefits, and all that.
This was in the later 1800s (in the Haitian scenario) -- but I can't
remember exactly what date.

Fun idea, but they'd have to have a referendum and agree to form a
state, or at least that has been the protocol for Caribbean islands.

Damn it Opal who are you?
None of the books tell it true.
There are a lot of people who might have sued.
Some say later you were arrogant and rude.
You might have made it up from leaves that were strewed.
You used did and do in ways that seemed really screwed.
Nothing about you seems to make sense except you were unglued.
Somewhere along the line you were glued and then you grewed.

> >   (http://www.heelstone.com), Click Poetry
> >   (http://www.clickpoetry.com), and Poems That Go

well simply to address this matter of so many liberals @ .edu:  let's
grant, for the sake of argument, that humanities depts ARE rife with
liberals... so what then?... what about schools of engineering?...
another liberal bastion?... physics, biology, chemistry, math---more
liberalism?... business schools?---left, or right?...

the assault on the left by the right in terms of the humanities alone
rather misses the point... or, passes for the point (aka secret
handshake) that conservatives wish to make---i.e., that a lot of
learning is a dangerous thing, and that we ought not to trust
intellectual (as opposed to more vocational) culture generally
(attacking the humanities, btw, is nearly tantamount to attacking
women, as we know there are generally more women in the humanities
than in the scientific/technical disciplines---so i see this assault
as a veiled attack e.g. on feminism, and don't think the neocons
don't know this)... it might be interesting to compare
disciplinarities in terms of left-right politics, but that
possibility---which might/might not turn up much---ends up buried
under this kind of tar & feather assault...

i think it might have been stanley fish (i can't quite recall) who
suggested some time ago, to the effect, that if young republicans
want to go after phd's in english and end up making, say, $50K at 50
years old, well then by all means!... that might not be likely, i'll
grant, if one's worldview is largely entrepreneurial... and in any
case there are further iterations at stake here that also get lost...
e.g., that one might vote democractic yet be an extremely
"conservative" scholar of literature (and so on and on---not to mix &
match election politics with other sorts of politics, but---)...

best,

I am really offended at this attack on baboons.  I've never met one that was
"asocial."  What does that word mean, anyway?  How is it different from
"antisocial"?

Any help on this headache would be deeply appreciated: I publish a freely
available webzine, for which I receive no monies or subsidies etc, one which
makes no claim to copyright or economic rights in work it publishes, all
rights reside with authors, and am intending to publish a set of
translations from certain living foreign language poets in the forthcoming
issue. Now obviously I have permission from the translator/s of those works
but it has been put to me that I, as the editor, need to secure permission
from the authors of the original works as well. Now my understanding had
been that the translator +may+ need to secure permission from the original
text's author but that an editor requires only the permission of the
translator, as long, of course, that the original text is not reproduced
too. Does anyone have any accurate information on this issue (I don't want
to get into a debate about the rights and wrongs of it, rather I just want
to know where I stand) I've done some investigations and find a blur of
contradictions, for instance 'fair use' can come into play as can the
question of whether a poem has been translated into (in this case) English
before.

Unfortunately this is real.  The Administration pays attention to people
like Daniel Pipes and others who have contend that area studies are
ideologically driven--essentially because many professors do not subscribe
their manichaean viewpoints.  More unfortunately, this is just a taste of
how the Administration will treat higher education next year, since they
think it is a good issue to campaign on.

-- Maria, could you explain this?  I have no idea what this is about.  Could you
unpack it a bit?  Remember, I am talking about WITHIN universities -- a short
summary of the info I've read over the summary was in John Leo's UW NEWS and WORLD
REPORT article -- which you now have to pay 3 dollars to get.  It is summarized
here:

http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/leo091702.asp

Are you saying that at the University of Minnesota English department there are
actual neo-conservatives, or even a single Republican that you can name?

-- This appears to me to be circular -- and to be at odds with what Maria Damon is
saying when she says that neo-cons rule.  In English departments??  Are editors
less well-educated than journalists?  I found this weird.  Could you explain this?

-- I haven't heard any conservatives asking for affirmative action within
universities.  Just equal opportunity!  I don't think I encountered a single
conservative in any undergraduate or graduate classes.  I had some conservative
colleagues when I was in Finland, and frankly, I hated them.  I seem to like
anarchists and libertarians the best, but that's beside the point.

-- Helms is a straw man.  Rene Girard did read Derrida, and all the others.  He is
a closer case -- on an intellectual basis.  He's a conservative Catholic -- his dad
was the director of the Museum of the Popes in Avignon.  He's extremely bright,
wouldn't you say?

I'm mostly having fun here I admit -- playing devil's advocate.  I wanted to
introduce the idea of universal standards (when almost everybody else these days
has caved in on that front) -- instead of falling into relativism.  I think that
unless we have some kind of universal standard, or at least the notion of it, we
can't have a meaningful conversation.  This goes not only in politics but in
aesthetics.  Unless we agree that one country (or one poem) is better than another
-- in terms of some index or another -- for instance -- longevity, or hygiene, or
even gay or women's  rights -- we can't talk about what changes are required.

There is an implicit assumption that the well-off countries are sucking the
resources out of third world countries, but if the first world was to disappear
overnight would conditions within subSaharan Africa improve overnight as well?
Without the European west, would the Islamic countries be better off?  Could
anybody substantiate this?  this seems to be an implicit assumption, but I think it
is wrong.  What would immediately lead to great changes would be women's rights
within all those countries.  I have been arguing that since women's right to vote
-- granted only in the last century -- civilization was at a point of total
stagnation.  It remains so in those countries that haven't granted this -- if one
half of a population is totally ignorant, how can a country function?

But everybody is at least agreed that there is such a thing as a standard of misery
such that voting rights and freedom of speech for all is something to wish upon a
population?  Thank you so much for trying to function!

I looked at the article briefly and was shocked to see that the
Democratic Party is considered a "party of the left."  if that's your
standard, maybe you are right that there are more democrats than
republicans in the academy.  but "offing"??? that's quite a charge.
because i am registered as a democrat (faute de mieux right now), and
i teach in a university, i am "offing" a republican?  there are
republicans and neo-conservatives in my dept as in all others.  and
there are neo-cons who vote democratic.

Maria, could you specify on a point by point basis what you see as drivel in the
article?  Versions of it have spread through many bastions of conservative thought.

Also, would you agree with the idea that in all countries where women have greater
rights there is also greater prosperity?

Could you name a single Republican in your department?

Where Sharing Isn't a Dirty Word
By Michelle Delio

02:00 AM Nov. 15, 2003 PT

CHAPEL HILL, North Carolina -- Want to sit in on a Tibetan monks'
science
class?

Perhaps you're curious about how kudzu grows? Maybe you'd like to listen

to some classic Southern folk music, hear a Nobel Prize-winning poet
read
his work, learn how to upload your mind, tend bees, speak Japanese or
heal
with herbs?

Or you might just want to download some free software.

Ibiblio, one of the Web's oldest and largest digital libraries, has all
this and much, much more -- and all of it is completely free to
visitors,
thanks to backing from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
and
technology companies like Linux distributor Red Hat.

"Making the invisible visible is what ibiblio does best," said ibiblio
director Paul Jones.

Ibiblio's staff and contributors rescue documents, videos, audio and
image
files from dusty archives or attics where few could view them and put
them
on the Web, where anyone with an Internet connection can retrieve the
information.

The library also gives Web space to those who can't host their own sites

due to political or financial considerations.

Housed on a couple of racks of thin-client servers tucked into a corner
of
the University of North Carolina's huge computer room, ibiblio averages
about 3 million information requests per day, and the
contributor-maintained collections are expanding daily.

Visitors aren't restricted to just browsing the collections, either.
They
can critique or add information to an existing collection, or create and

manage their own collection of information.

"Basically, if you want to share information about almost any subject,
ibiblio will be happy to host you for free," said Jones. "The only rules

are that whatever you want to share must be noncommercial, legal and
have
some value to other people."

Ibiblio began its life in 1992 under the moniker SunSITE, with funding
from Sun Microsystems and a mandate "to share software and other things
of
interest," according to an October 1992 press release. SunSITE became
MetaLab in 1997, after Sun stopped funding the project. But Jones had a
problem with the new name.

"I'm dyslexic. Every time I'd type MetaLab it'd come out as 'meatball.'"

Happily, MetaLab/Meatball was re-christened ibiblio in 2002, when it
received a multimillion-dollar grant from the Red Hat-affiliated Center
for the Public Domain. Jones occasionally mangles the spelling, but at
least it doesn't come out as a recognizably silly word.

Users still flood ibiblio when a new upgrade is released for one of the
many open-source software projects that the library hosts, but ibiblio
is
now much more than just a download site. Jones and his staff want to
create a 21st-century library based on open-source ideals.

"We'd like to demonstrate that the best way to protect and preserve
so-called intellectual property is to share it freely with everyone,"
said
Jones. "Shared information is enhanced and improved, so its value can
only
increase. Hoarded knowledge just stagnates."

Ibiblio's mostly part-time university student staff is as eclectic as
the
library's collections. Jones carefully picks people who he believes can
bring interesting new perspectives to the project. The current staff
includes majors in French lit, filmmaking and philosophy.

"Most of us have tech skills but aren't majoring in computer science,"
said ibiblio staffer Patrick Herron, a poet and philosophy student who
is
now majoring in information science. "Paul tends to pick staffers who
are
really interested in making information accessible to users, as opposed
to
people who are primarily interested in computers."

Jones, 52, also writes poetry and teaches journalism classes at UNC. He
considered becoming a journalist, but his dyslexia made it difficult for

him to write quickly. So he decided to major in computer science.

"This was back in the days of punch cards, and trust me -- dyslexia and
punch cards do not mix well. Happily, my teachers didn't know enough
about
computers to know I was clueless, that I spindled, folded and mutilated
virtually every card that I laid my hands on. But after a while I
learned
to compensate."

Jones started at UNC as a systems programmer in 1978. An ecumenical
hippie
geek at heart, he takes equal delight in fast computers and slow-cooked
barbecue. But the driving force of his life is sharing information --
about anything and everything.

Over a plate of North Carolina's finest pulled pork, Jones told us about
a
Colorado conference on file sharing he spoke at a few years back. Music
industry executive Don Grusin was also on the panel.

"Grusin kept calling music downloaders pirates," said Jones. "I thought
that was just awful. I told him the people who care about music enough
to
download it are the people he should love the most.

"If the record companies reached out and showed some love and respect to

downloaders, then everyone could work together to find a way to
peacefully
coexist."

It's odd to hear a college professor talking with not even a twinge of
irony about showing the love, but it seems to come naturally to Jones.

"My life now is still like it was in the '60s, but without all the sex
and
drugs," Jones said. "I try to be happy and love everybody. Usually, I
succeed."

(Michelle Delio and photographer Laszlo Pataki are midway through a
four-week, geek-seeking journey along U.S. Route 1. If you know a town
they should visit, a person they should meet, a weird roadside
attraction
they must see or a great place to fuel up on lobster rolls, barbecue,
conch fritters and the like, send an e-mail to
wiredroadtrip@earthlink.net.)

Kari,
First, thank you for having compiled such a detailed list; it may well =
take months for me to pour over it and cry.

Second, we all need to acknowledge the horrors of both =
aggressive-control crimes and the failure of the system to find either =
fault or culprits.

I may not sleep for a month as I ponder all these names you have posted. =
 Yet, at the same time, I am comforted and acknowledge the benefits that =
come from your having taken the time and expended the effort to have =
posted the names.
Thank you; Damn you! Thank You. =20
Alex=20
P.S. I found the names of four whom I knew and befriended.  I knew only =
of the deaths of two...shit!=20

Four years ago at a major university. I can't be more specific because of

I said, as do the statistics,  "the more likely." There are well-educated
conservatives, just a lot fewer.
Editors are employed by publishers. Publishers determine the politics of a
paper.

I was joking, but you seem to imply that you know of cases in which
conservatives didn't get university jobs merely because they were
conservatives.

I won't comment on Girard, as my experience with him is let's say
unpleasant. But let's not play games--it's a waste of my time, and I don't
have a lot to spare right now. I was responding to your "This is not going
to sail outside of the protected environment of
academia. All the conservatives have the weaknesses of the liberals down
pat. They read their enemies," which would seem to refer to
"outside...academia."

Cuba has had three democratically-elected governments in its history, each
overthrown by US invasion under the Pratt Amendment that the US congress
forcede into the Cuban constitution. The US was more comfortable with the
two brutal dictatorships that preceded Castro.

Kirby, your knowledge of history seems to be rather limited. Christianity
has been a scourge in most places, even before it was used to justify slavery.

"There were of course unions"? You mean you're not aware of the near-civil
war that Britain was in for most of the 19th century?

Yes, and I think many of can all testify that Rumsfeld, Rice, Wolfolitz,
Cheney, Bush - the whole neo-con cabal - were destroyed by liberal
professors inculcating each one of them with a sense of language and
literature and democratic vistas while simultaneously instilling the zeal to
lead the Republic in a grand and beautiful crusade to lift the globe from
the manifold evils of theocratic, totalitarian etc. regimes. Each of these
leaders clearly have been  hammered into defeat - or call it "cut and run" -
by the ill-informed use of the English sentence. If only they had been given
honest, conservative professors, they would have been given clear headed
analytical skills, the capacity to orchestrate authentic research and listen
without bias to intelligence, the curiosity to know the the history, values
and the various mind-sets of various global actors (undoubtedly juiced by
language training and the counter-ethnocentric experience of taking the time
to live within other cultures), indeed a learned  appreciation for cultural
and intellectual pluralism, and the skills to negotiate within cultures and
to learn the advantage of negotiation over the inevitable losses produced by
military intervention and occupation.

Yet these poor folks, it appears were cut-off from any such immersion at a
very young age. The fault of Liberal professors, yes, that's only thing I
can think of as one more young person gets cut down in Iraq by the misuse
and abuse of the English sentence. Indeed it's time to get new professors
into University English Departments, especially those who can really teach
and enable our young and future leaders to learn the value of good grammar
and a well informed, ignorance free sentence. By golly. Toby, indeed, the
way things are going, you may have a calling!

In the 1950s Richard Hofstadter couldn't get a tenure track job until he
won a Pulitzer--suspected of being a red. There was a general purge. In the
1960s, when I was at Columbia, there were a few politically active faculty
on the left and a lot more on the right. Remember campus riots and Vietnam?

I was a social worker for 15 byears and rarely met a conservative in the
profession. For that matter, in the drug-treatment agencies I worked in
there was universal agreement that the drug laws should be repealed. Do you
really think that hiring bias accounted for this? If not, how are
universities different?

Much of this is simply too unsubstantiated to argue against. You should
demand point by point substantiation.

As I only teach on occasion I'm not the best person to speak to these
allegations, but I do know that I've never been subject to any of this and
that I don't recognize the situation described. I have on the other hand
been required to sign loyalty oaths to the government.

Deconstruction, if you hadn't noticed, enlists a lot of conservatives. Paul
de Man ring a bell?

I've never thought of US News and World Report as a liberal rag. Neither I
suspect does its editor.  What does USNWR have to fear? a professorial
intifada?

Note that the article has a very limited range of sources, all on the
extreme right. A cursory examination also reveals the biases of the site.
See for example
http://www.jewishworldreview.com/avi/shafran_2003_11_05.php3, "Prochoice
Judaism."

Be careful which children you play with, Kirby. This stuff is all talk radio.

Just back from a week of readings in and around Sheffield.  Many thanks to
everyone incl. Alan Halsey, Geraldine Monk, and Dave Kennedy and his
wonderful wife.  A big thanks too to John Sugden's group in Bradford and
the Bukowski's crew. Thanks to Archie Marham and the students for making it
happen. I was surprised and delighted that Alison Croggin came to a party
thrown for me by the novelist Linda Lee Welch.  Alison looked fit and was

here is my backchannel response to kirby from y-day:
hi kirby i'm not willing to do a blow by blow (not enough time) and
i've exhausted my 2-posts to poetics, but i did see one thing that
was egregiously mistaken:  that chairs used to hire people who
disagreed politically because they were good scholars.  this is
patently false. have you heard of the mccarthy era?  if you had
leftist tendencies you had to either lie about them or risk
unemployment or worse.  h. bruce franklin lost his *tenured* position
at stanford for being a revolutionary in the 1970s.  before
affirmative action, political agreements and disagreements were
controlled by simply eliminating (or never having seriously thought
to hire) women and/or people of color from the faculty.  and that's
just one misrepresentation among many.
my colleagues and i don't usually discuss our party affiliations, so
i don't want to name any republicans because it would be hearsay, but
i am fairly certain that i know some, both current faculty and former
graduate students.

also, today i'll add: in the "good old days" the head of a dept would
write to his old friends at other depts and say, which of your
advisees would be good for such and such a job? and the friend would
respond and thus jobs were given.  that is what's known as the "old
boys' network."  there was no general job search, no interview
process to determine who really was the best candidate, etc.  this
hardly seems a way to guarantee a diversity of opinions etc.

wake up and smell the coffee, honey bunny!  please don't fall for
these egregious falsehoods.

Our Quiet Lives...


This is the safety zone. Within these borders... Everything else outside -
corruption, decay. This is safe for us. Love at the barricades. What
happens outside the frame. The frame problem - not to adjust the real, but
to keep it out. The problem with everything real.

Go through the works. Begin with the indices, directories. Locate
similarities in format, style, enumeration, content, names and dates. Mark
and re-mark them. Keep them for future reference. By virtue of the sign
the body is not a sign. That is, culturally determined but obdurate
nonetheless. You can see the body. You never see the sign.

Everywhere there are incompleted books for you to finish. My friends
belong nowhere and have no badges. Lack of identity is the beginning of
wisdom. Without signs... You might wander through the wrong door.

What I was going to say slips out, as the tongue moves. That is, it
remains, as in 'remains of the day,' un-spoken. You can only imagine, and
what you imagine is always right, write and written, within the borders.
It's safe within the borders. They're here for the moment.

All these packets are enumerated, addressed, like the directories
themselves. They're ordered so you can read and are comfortable that way.
You can dissemble, forget. The addresses disappear forever. Even to save
the words... within the protocols, the borders. The words are boarders and
grow old. The truth of the pun is the pun of the truth. Truth slips out, a
pun, my word, safe here.

The world is so unsafe, plasma, sun-spotted. We take these few moments and
re-make the frame. My books, my films, the animations of my life, are
within it. Nikuko is here and Jennifer is here, Travis is here and Julu is
here, and Clara Hielo Internet, too. We are comfortable here, these names
our names. We are here for you, part of you. You call us forth with this
reading which is a writing as well. We pour into you.

It's safe and warm here for human life. We are amazed that anyone still
does good, does something unequivocal and calming. We are amazed these
tiny spaces come forth in the midst of armageddon. They come forth and are
quiet, are peaceful. They hold us in their arms, they sing to us softly.
We cry quietly among the lullabies. We are at home, and we are up and down
with the frame.

Re: Tom Beckett for reading and opening the field a little. To everyone else, enjoy.


Myth

As I was saying, reminded of our recent algorithm.

Immediately forget you are permanently ephemeral.

All necessary implication of dailiness has long disappeared from the word ‘journal’.

I befriend myself & no longer exist.[1]

A repository for whatever one does without knowing why.

As long as there is a form & a system.

I am a ghost of a former atrocity, that is, myself.

We are nearly through with living.

Tell me, who can be bothered with knowledge.

The individual is a mathematical exaggeration of its responsibilities.[2]

It is all the truth it knows, that is, it knows nothing.

As you quoted, being ephemeral.

Recurrent is.[3]

I thank myself & am appalled.

What do you mean when.

I was wondering, but then I stopped wondering.

The world wants to be large & simultaneously at large.

If routine & dailiness should go on forever.

What happens to the individual.

A disjunction in the formal 'you'.

As I have remarked.

Weather being the exaggeration of an implied military-industrial complication.

I keep a journal as a reminder to write in my journal.

Why.[4]

I say there is a form to this insistence.

Did you forget already.

_____________________________________
1
I’ll give testimony to
what it is possible
not to express.

give me a word,
& I’ll bake a pie of it.

2
language does not express.
on the contrary—it accepts all inequalities,
especially when concerning the distribution of intelligence & its degrees.
this is called mathematical intercourse.
don’t laugh.

3
ibid.

4
this poem
is a failure.
this poem
will continue to fail.

if the poem fails
then only can it continue.




Myth

Imagine that I am exhausted to the point of perusal.

Perfection is what is unbelievable, the joke.[1]

Nothing asks of nothing.

How much would you pay for a poem.

Expression, on its own, is a form of laziness.

Analogy is burning & I have no way out & this is what the author is demanding.

Did it ever occur to you to imagine nothing.[2]

Professionalism is a byproduct of an undesirable joke.

In a third attempt, the name & number become the plight of numerous narrators.

What do you mean when you mean.

We are nearly through with being suspicious.

In a speech delivered by someone at an undisclosed time at an undisclosed location.

Expression is not only a form of laziness but the plot thickens.

Thought is blessed with an incomplete sentence.

Pat yourself on the back & take note of it.

You're either with us or within us.[3]

Generally, the first condition of inquiry is adulteration or at least an act of deterrence.

I am aware but is this awareness.

A plot can be rescued by following the concentric circles back to their center.

When challenged, the individual resembled the mouths of narrators.

What you did not know usually came back as reader response.

A translation is worth.[4]

If paranoia were portioned out & what is the meaning of this.

Somewhere, at the end of thinking.

Have we met before.

Have we met before this sentence.

Sonnet:  No Dice

"The government (it was leaked) will not negotiate tariffs under pressure,"
the president said, from his home in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
He jotted down names of concessionaires who will not negotiate,
assuring us that the water and light cuts of the past few days

will be thoroughly investigated. "I want them to know that they
can tighten every screw that they want to, but that I am a president who
has arranged to do what must be done," he averred. At that very moment, three
cartographers happened by, checking their power grids. The dean

of the press corps, as usual, was silent--her secretary, less so. Possible supply
problems over the next several months went unnoticed until the very last
moment. Tariffs congealed on the windowsills. Directors of some multi-
nationals endorsed new slogans for upcoming ad campaigns, caused

at least indirectly, by inflexible and implacable news reports. "Still, as we have
predicted, we have no credible evidence that cuts were caused intentionally,"
some said. "How would it benefit us to strangle all those Argentinian towns?"
one asked, rhetorically. "In order to mine, we must cut down some trees."

And, even as they spoke, Maine voters, who knew a lot about felling
trees, voted down the building of a million new casinos.

In my excitement for the value and need to hire conservative professors (in
response to Kirby Olsen's concerns about liberal ones controlling the
academic world), Mark Weiss pointed out that I mistakenly wrote "Toby"
instead of "Kirby." My apologies to any Toby on the list.
Sentence should have read:

"... By golly. Kirby, indeed, the way things are going, you may have a
calling!"

Parenthetically I responded via Aldon Nielson's subject post ("...pesky
liberal scholars") because the "Congo" subject heading, given the real
subject, I find off-putting. Africa, and particularly the Congo, already has
enough issues of its own without having to take on a totally gratuitous
association with this particular one. Without asking, I suspect Aldon
changed the subject for similar reasons.

(full original message with correction)
Yes, and I think many of can all testify that Rumsfeld, Rice, Wolfolitz,
Cheney, Bush - the whole neo-con cabal - were destroyed by liberal
professors inculcating each one of them with a sense of language and
literature and democratic vistas while simultaneously instilling the zeal to
lead the Republic in a grand and beautiful crusade to lift the globe from
the manifold evils of theocratic, totalitarian etc. regimes. Each of these
leaders clearly have been  hammered into defeat - or call it "cut and run" -
by the ill-informed use of the English sentence. If only they had been given
honest, conservative professors, they would have been given clear headed
analytical skills, the capacity to orchestrate authentic research and listen
without bias to intelligence, the curiosity to know the the history, values
and the various mind-sets of various global actors (undoubtedly juiced by
language training and the counter-ethnocentric experience of taking the time
to live within other cultures), indeed a learned  appreciation for cultural
and intellectual pluralism, and the skills to negotiate within cultures and
to learn the advantage of negotiation over the inevitable losses produced by
military intervention and occupation.

Yet these poor folks, it appears were cut-off from any such immersion at a
very young age. The fault of Liberal professors, yes, that's only thing I
can think of as one more young person gets cut down in Iraq by the misuse
and abuse of the English sentence. Indeed it's time to get new professors
into University English Departments, especially those who can really teach
and enable our young and future leaders to learn the value of good grammar
and a well informed, ignorance free sentence. By golly. Kirby, indeed, the
way things are going, you may have a calling!

Mark,

The problem is that we have a Republican governor in this state.  He's slashed
our budget already.  I suspect that not being aware of what's being said about
academia in vast sections of the right is not going to play to the advantage of
this profession.  I am predicting a massive budget cut in state universities
across the board if Bush wins the next election, especially in states with a
Republican governor.  Our governor is Republican.  He appoints the chancellor of
the SUNY system.  The chancellor is number 8 in terms of political power in this
state, and he has to do whatever the governor tells him to do or he's out of a
job.  It probably works in a similar way in many states.  These articles are of
course VERY right-wing, and are appearing in all the media outlets of the right,
and the constant hullabaloo in Reader's Digest and other journals indicates that
talk-show radio sources as you put it have targeted academia.  And I think the
rhetoric is reaching boiling point.  Even my mechanic calls this college "commie
central."  I have just been wondering if anybody else is aware of this
phenomenon.  Somehow academia has become the central gun site.  While the public
universities cannot be shut down -- the argument is that they belong to the
public -- not to the left-wing -- they can have their sails selectively trimmed.
And the budgets are going to be cut to the bone as soon as the election is over
next November if the right continues to gain.

I'm not even thinking about whether these documents are true, although I suspect
that they have an element of skewed truth.  What interests me is the public
perception and the potential fall-out.

It will go better in the private universities that have substantial endowments --
they can weather the coming storm.  Perhaps I am just worrying over nothing!

Hell's Angels, Swollen Members. the New VI & Victoria City Council
by Goyo de la Rosa •Saturday November 15, 2003 at 09:53 PM


The 'Swollen Members,' local trash culture favourites of the decadent
Victoria Liberal City Council, have produced a music video which
glorifies the notorious Hell's Angel's hoodlums.  Are the Swollen
Members and media Mogul Moses Znaimer the links between the bikers and
their friends at Victorai City Council?

+++

Moe Sihota, my favourite silly socialist lawyer who would rather be on
tv than in the courtroom, had a chap on the 'New VI TV' station the
other night.  Some guy shilling a new book about the Hell's Angels in
Canada.

To segue into the talking heads part of the show, Moses Znaimer's
skeleton staff in Victoria used a video by the infamous 'Swollen
Members' rock group which shows the local trash culture lads hanging out
in supposedly cool poses with dangerous- and nasty-looking fellows with
big beer paunches, the latter worthies wearing the infamous club's
insignia with skulls and other death culture symbols on their studded
leathers.

All of the ugly bikers had incredibly beautiful-looking women lolling
about in suggestive poses, attired in the typically skimpy outfits
favoured by gangsta rappers' whores.  This is the band, I remind my
gentle readers, that not so long ago was used by Mayor Lowe and the
Liberal Sport Cabal to make themselves look cool by association (like
Paul Martin with Bono), to distract the people from the fact that they
were about to borrow $30,000,000 to build the new multiplex, without a
clear democratic mandate to do so , but I digress...

But first they had to throw one last debauched farewell party, so all
the phony sentimentalists could cry their tedious crocodile tears over
the imminent demo of the old Memorial Arena, built after the second
world war to commemorate  fallen veterans.

Now, to their credit, the boys in the band have seen the light of
reason, and apparently have decided that the video was a bad idea after
all, but that new-found contrition apparently didn't stop the New VI
from showing clips from it the other night during prime time.

Sihota wondered out loud how the band might want to 'pay back' society
for their egregious lack of judgement in shooting and marketing the
obviously objectionable video.  Were they going to send some of the
money made on the CDs sold through the video to victims-of-crime groups,
he naively suggested?  Sure, Moe, and the NDP is going to form
government in the next  BC election...

Back to reality: the construction of the new multiplex is proceeding on
schedule, we are told, the Swollen Members' videos are shown regularly
on Much Music, another Moses Znaimer trash culture outlet which probably
has some of the most offensive music videos in the world showing
regularly, degrading women, and banalizing violence in the process...and
ex-Victoria City Councillor Laura Acton still has her  high profile job
at the station, after many others were recently let go in downsizing due
to lack of ads sold.  Acton is recognized by many as the insider's
insider who apparently finessed the deal with the Liberal Sport Cabal
(Victoria City Council) for Moses Znaimer to get a tax write-offf worth
many hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Am I skirting too close to libel
here?  Watch for the Concerned Citizens' expose on this scandal in the
coming weeks...

But the bigger question Moe should have been asking is this: what are
the links between the Swollen Members, the Hell's Angels, and the
decadent and  apparently criminally-linked Victoria City Council?  He'll
likely never ask that  embarrassing question, as long as Acton is
working in the station to protect corporatist interests there.
Meanwhile, the pretentious station continues to push trash culture,
acting as if it was in sync with local culture (which it clearly is not,
hence their poor ratings) and to propagandize for the banalization of
evil in sleepy little Victoria.

There must be some UVic journalism student out there who wants to pursue
this story.  Go for it!

Hi Maria -- don't bother with a point by point then.  It may be true that there
are equally balanced departments somewhere.  I haven't experienced them, but it is
somehow good to know that somebody believes that this exists.

I can't stand either the left or the right in this country (although I like
individuals of both stripes, I can't stand the terrifying mob action called
politics).

I hate the Calvinist right -- I don't fit in with them because they think that
people can behave in a god-like manner.  This completely disgusts me and makes me
utterly sick to my stomach, because I know that it is a mask and that it isn't
true.

I hate the Marxist left -- I don't fit with them because they think they are good
people, but I don't believe that there has ever been or ever will be good people.

And I hate the way they use each other as their excuse not only for their
existence, but as their rationale for violence.  In the McCarthy days they'd point
to the Stalinist crimes as an excuse to get rid of scholars -- and so many went
off the roofs of buildings at the UW in Seattle -- seven or so.  And now there is
a turn to the left in the departments, and a consequent terror.

I always feel like I see almost an animalistic situation inside of people,
especially when terror sets in.  And the horrifying spectacle of class war, and
all the faces that are presented as good and evil, when underneath it is just
animal survival.

One thing I hope I suppose is that these two sides continue to have each other in
gridlock for at least another hundred years, because if one side wins there will
be no freedom left at all.

One thing I like about NSK and what survives of the surrealist movement is the
consciousness of the utter Sadean evil inside everyone.  It really scares me to
meet people who think they are good, because that evil has no one watching it.
I'm not sure if it's scarier in Christians or in leftists -- it seems identical to
me.  The same kind of pious put-down -- the violent recourse to the high ground --
as they each chase one another through the high seas seeing one another as the
great white whale which once dead will yield absolute peace.

Right now the most immediate danger is that the right has targeted academia.
Please don't get caught with your pants down.  I don't want leftists to disappear
just yet.

A totally evil person -- KO

we don't have to go all the way back to the McCarthy era for tales of
attacks on faculty deemed to be on the left -- why don't the articles
claiming Left domination of academia ever seem to notice such phenomena as
John Silber's decades-long effort to make Howard Zinn resign, or Silber's
firing, despite positive reviews, of faculty whose politics he didn't
like?  And does anybody really believe that the Trustees & Alumnae
Council's publication of a "study" that supposedly demonstrated the
treachery of faculty in the wake of 9/11 wasn't intended to have an effect
within the academy itself?

I don't think it's any of my business to name anyone I know anywhere and
identify their political party affiliations -- (and, just so it will be out
in public before some less scrupulous colleague outs me, I registered with
the D.C. Statehood Party when I first signed up to vote)

However, I note that the University of Minnesota is home to a chapter of
the National Association of Scholars as well as members of the Association
of Literary Scholars and Critics -- I am sure that those organizations
would be more than happy to connect anyone who inquires with Minnesota's
small, brave band of conservative faculty -- who will, in turn, be pleased
to explain just how bad things have gotten in the People's Republic of
Minneapolis (where, I learn from the NAS Newsletter, which I read
religiously, "literature" study has devolved to, gawd help us, cultural
studies, except when the name of "literature" is trotted out to dupe
unsuspecting donors) --

Privacy dispute threatens Street Link
by Lindsay Kines, Judith Lavoie - Times Colonist •Sunday November 16,
2003 at 02:04 AM
Government holds up funding after society refuses to name homeless
clients

The B.C. government withheld money from Victoria's largest emergency
shelter last month for failing to hand over personal information on the
homeless.

The Ministry of Human Resources later released the money, but said it
will make further payments only if the Victoria Cool Aid Society
provides detailed "person reports" about its clients -- names, dates of
birth, dates when they entered and left the shelter and number of nights
stayed.

Carol Finnie, Cool Aid's chief executive officer, said the society is
worried about violating their clients' privacy and has contacted B.C.'s
privacy commissioner for advice. The society was told to get the
ministry's reasons for wanting the information, but the ministry has yet
to respond, Finnie said.

A clause in the society's contract requires Cool Aid to produce the
reports. But Finnie said the ministry has never asked for them before,
and the shelters have never produced them.

Cool Aid, which has operated for 35 years, runs the 16-bed Sandy
Merriman House for women and the 55-bed Streetlink Emergency Shelter.

The society has always produced statistical reports on occupancy rates,
number of beds used and number of people served, Finnie said.

"We've never given them personal information on our clients before."

Human Resources Minister Murray Coell said the ministry needs personal
information about Cool Aid's clients so staff can verify that the hostel
and money are being used appropriately.

Coell would not explain why the ministry cannot work with the more
general data that it has used in the past, but said Cool Aid has agreed
to supply the information on clients.

"They have a contract with us to provide that information. They agreed
to it and signed it," he said.

Finnie said the ministry withheld payment of $116,000 to Cool Aid's
Streetlink and Sandy Merriman shelters last month. The society was never
told and only discovered the missing money by examining its cash flow.

In a strongly worded letter to the ministry, Finnie and shelters manager
Don McTavish protested the suspended payment as "unwarranted" and
accused the ministry of "operating in bad faith."

The letter states that a ministry official "advised that the Cool Aid
Society will not receive funds for shelter operations until we produce
the personal information on our clients

"This is not working with us in good faith to resolve our difficulties,"
the letter says. "There are privacy issues to be addressed."

The letter states that Cool Aid has referred the matter to its legal
counsel.

A 17-year-old homeless girl, who was camped outside the Streetlink
shelter Saturday, said the government has no right gathering personal
information on her or other homeless people. "I don't think it's really
any of their business," she said,

The girl, who would only identify herself by her street name, Candy,
said she has been on the street for a year, fleeing abuse, and living on
money earned panhandling. She says she can't get welfare, can't find a
job because she has no place to live, and can't find a place to live
because she has no income. "This is the only place left."

Her friend, who goes by the name Angel, also questioned why the
government needs to know his name or age, which, he fears, would allow
them to delve into his family history. "They don't need to know that.
Why?"

The two viewed the latest tactic as one more attack on the poor. "I say
send some of the government people down here for a week and see how they
handle it," Candy said.

Finnie said it's not the first time the government has stopped payments
to the shelters in the past 12 months.

Finnie said the society discovered in October that the government
withheld $131,000 slated for Sandy Merriman House in July and August and
only paid the money in September.

She said the stopped payments appear to be part of a larger pattern of
harassment by the government at a time when agencies should be working
together to fight homelessness.

"The numbers are increasing," Finnie said. Streetlink currently runs at
100 per cent capacity and turns away 25 to 30 people a night.

In addition to the stopped payments, Finnie said the comptroller general
recently called on short notice to audit the shelters. In the letter to
the ministry, McTavish and Finnie state that "while we have welcomed the
auditors and will co-operate with them, I would have preferred receiving
communications from the ministry previous to them contacting us."

Earlier this year, Finnie says Cool Aid was forced to issue layoff
notices to shelter staff, because the ministry refused to confirm
whether money would be available in June.

And Finnie said Cool Aid knew nothing about the government's recent
decision to give $18,000 to the Salvation Army to open five new beds for
Victoria's homeless.

"We feel like we're being not only cut out of the process around
discussions on how the government wants to address homelessness, but
also they're not paying us on a regular basis, so we are footing the
bill."

When asked whether the government is harassing Cool Aid, Coell replied
"No, certainly not."

However, Coell said ministry staff have been asked to work directly with
Cool Aid as the organization is recovering from financial problems.

Coell said some of the funding issues arise because Cool Aid is not
applying for funding, even though it has been approved in the budget.
"They actually need to ask for the funding . . . and they need to work
with our staff as other shelters are doing throughout the province," he
said.

The hiccups in funding for Sandy Merriman House originated with Cool
Aid, he said. "We are committed to funding Sandy Merriman House. The
funds are in our budget and they just need to apply for them."

Similarly, Cool Aid did not apply for the recent grant which went to the
Salvation Army, he said.

Cool Aid should have known that it could apply for the cold, wet weather
grants as the strategy has been in place for a number of years, Coell
said.

"They need to apply for the grants and I don't believe they have. I have
actually requested that my staff phone them directly, at the assistant
deputy minister level, to get the information they need to them."

This is appalling!  After reading this paragraph about the final years and
hours of Hart Crane's life --

"In 1927, Crane visited California with Herbert Wise and found himself in a
'pink vacuum' of 'nondescript people who seem just bound from nowhere to
nothing.' His intimacy with his mother, whose loans helped to sustain him
and his estrangement from his father (who died in 1931, pulling Crane into
the legal thicket of a contested will), also contributed to a state of
growing despair. When he went to Mexico with Peggy Cowley in 1931, the lure
of the region that he had first visited at the age of sixteen could not
overcome what Cowley called his 'suicidal mania.' After a drunken brawl on
the ship A. S. Orizaba, Crane escaped from a boarded room and leaped into
the sea. His last words, according to Cowley, were, 'I'm not going to make
it, dear. I'm utterly disgraced.'"

I noticed that Crane's father, Clarence Arthur Crane, INVENTED THE LIFE
SAVER -- as in, the candy.  This invention made his father's fortune.

Strange coincidence, or . . . something more?

Well maybe if you old dudes would have TOLD us younger poets about this
curiosity, we wouldn't keep discovering it.

Another one: Did you know that Henry W Longfellow's second wife--- Fanny
Appleton Longfellow -- set herself on fire while trying to apply sealing wax
to letters in the family living room?  He ran around trying to put her out,
but he failed, and she died. His own clothes caught on fire, and he
sustained significant injury.  It was a super depressing time for
Longfellow.  He had learned the full import of being a Fireside Poet.

I've often wondered at these tragi-ironic & extreme endings of literary folk
and/or their loved ones. Today these stories would be sucked straight into
The Simpsons or South Park.

Or maybe I'm partial to the pomo-openness of such comic-ironic genre.

Anyway, Poe's ending is absurd, given his life, as is Charlotte Mew's. Their
endings also seem to me fitting per this particular
shock-of-but-not-supposed-to-laugh-at-the-absurdity-endings: Poe of course
died literally in a mysterious loss of self, something his work seemed to
cultivate, a point Lacan almost makes explicit.  Mew, after struggling to
write and support self and family members throughout the latter part of
life, committed suicide by drinking Lysol.  That's just so awful in every
possible domestic, consumerist or commercial way: of all substances, it had
to be the cleaning product, Lysol?--ugh, but of course.

Crane, as Spicer, had a deep streak of self-loathing. In Mexico, before his
ill fated ship passage back to New York, he lived in a house next to
Katherine Ann Porter. I don't have her book of essays handy, but in one
paragraph she reports Crane coming home late at night, quite drunk, climbed
a ladder up to his roof, where he stood at topmost point overlooking the
entire neighborhood and yelled at the top of his lungs, "I am William
Shakespeare. I am William Blake. I am Walt Whitman." Where upon she notes,
"Not once did he say, 'I am Hart Crane'."

Hmm he'd probably have to shout "Harold Crane" and didn't like "Harold,"
but wasn't totally convinced about "Hart" and it's not satisfying to
shout "I am ...? ....?" though it sure is understandable.

the shaft one eye accepts light for the other root grows tangled
a doubly strung base unequal elements reaching success sucked in
open red beads form gaining the dolphins' margin is water
propelled from one to the next here in water where it falls
animals come and both worlds appease either side of its head
to snap a branch now ruins this one flocks of white flap as it lands
the well the wall exceeds in shocking the skin standing in the sun
ahead in the middle it finds you loafing the ocean comes to the shore
leaning into a forest the charged epaulettes gravitate toward zero
pistons pump the image of a verb in the mirror the decision is
a system will collapse (wave never ending (wave never ending

floating red and trees and figures a wordless head but body all the same

by the light a yellow ceiling brightens the ceiling

while bending over to harvest dots the satchel spills

all that bird really has to know is five syllables

two on one hand and three at night

a simple maneuver strengthens the back of the head

in the morning rippling having ended

angstrom above angst above a periphery of glances diagrams speech
undetected a duende body falls the heart with its wheelâ€™s lure
by a star nailed to night the sky moves across a sample

Ron, your list below is not loaded with women authors.  In fact I see no
women authors here at all. So I suppose you're in a reasonable position
to
examine the question you ask: What do you support
if you publish in a journal that appears to exclude women or if you like
Ezra Pound?  I'd be glad if you would add my blog to your roll, though I
know I've mentioned this before ....

normally i don't get involved with american university sniping but when
you write-

 Remember, I am talking about WITHIN universities -- a short
summary of the info I've read over the summary was in John Leo's UW NEWS
and WORLD REPORT article -- which you now have to pay 3 dollars to get.
It is summarized here:
http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/leo091702.asp


and I follow the link to read this yer man John Leo writing this:


"It's not news that college professors are lopsidedly drawn from the
political left. But American Enterprise magazine offers some numbers on
how heavy the tilt has become."

so i have a look at the American Enterprise Institute to learn this:

"Instead of stuffy writers telling you what to think, you’ll examine
bright, breezy articles, clear charts and graphs, and powerful
illustrations that let you build your arguments and form your ideas."

Kirby, what draws you to this kind of research? I hope you don't teach any
sort of critical thinking or media awareness courses.

bewildered in Canada,
Kevin

Kevin,

This sounds fantastic! Any chance of taking a picture of the different
reasons (or at least yours) and posting them somewhere where those (like =
me)
with no chance of seeing them can see them?

Thanks,
Ben

Hi again,
I don't want to suggest that things are all sweet in Bowering's north.
Last week a man named Paul Martin , in essence, became our Prime Minister
without one single Canadian Citizen voting him to be our leader.

>
> Where will Paul Martin take us? - National Commentary - CBC radio - Nov
> 14, 2003

> It also included massive tax cuts for the wealthy and Canada's largest

> continental integration.
>
> The new plan would result in the most comprehensive surrender of

Joe Green, Jeet Thayil and Mark Lamoureux

"Later in life JOE GREEN decided that he would write about the big
subjects. Sadly, he has forgotten what these are. Thank God he has
discovered a trove of manuscripts left behind by various personages who
have passed over to the Other Side. Saved just as Yeats was --- however,
no woman named George was involved. He currently lives in the American
Midwest and received the best sort of literary education at the
University of Minnesota where professors would point to where Berryman
jumped and remark, always, that "he didn't hit the water."

"JEET THAYIL was born in Kerala, India, and educated in Hongkong, New
York and Bombay. In 1998, he returned to New York, where he received an
MFA from Sarah Lawrence College. His two earlier collections of poetry,
Gemini and Apocalypso, appeared, respectively, in Bombay and London.
Jeet Thayil is married and lives in New York City, where he works as an
editor and writer."

"MARK LAMOUREUX was born in Tolland, Connecticut, where he was raised by
appliances, mere miles away from the University of Connecticut where
Charles Olson spent his final days. He received his Bachelor's Degree
from Marlboro College in Marlboro, VT. His work has appeared or is
fothcoming in Jubilat, Lungfull!, Fulcrum, Art New England, Can We Have
Our Ball Back? and other publications. His chapbook, "City/Temple" was
released by Ugly Duckling Presse in November 2003. Another chapbook to
be published by Boston's Pressed Wafer is forthcoming in the winter of
2003/2004."

Last March, the Gothics News Service reported (below) on the results of a
National Purge and Shape Sculpture Competition. There have been no new
updates on the progress on getting permits for the installation, other than
some flimsy opposition from Utah's US Senator Orrin Hatch and his recording
choir. However, in light of tomorrow's Bush/Blair reunion in Britain
(protests et al) it seems important to reprint the original article:


World Leader Sculptures Planned for the Edge of Salt Lake

Salt Lake City, GNS, March 17, 2003. The National Purge and Shape Sculpture
Competition has just awarded Salty Dog Productions this year=B9s prize for a
proposal in which the winning artists will create salt-encrusted figures of
President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The new
sculptures will be sited on the edge of the Great Salt Lake.

In today=B9s press release, it is announced that =B3the sculptures, absolutely
realistic in height and shape, will be composed of crystals filtered and
hardened from a special processing plant that sits on a barge in the middle
of the lake.

=B3The lake=B9s crystals, especially under full sunlight, are noted for the way
they absorb, refract and distill translucent light in a manner described by
many as =8Cpurifying.=B9 =B3

Salty Dog Productions - in a joint statement with the National Purge and
Shape Foundation - declared that the sculptures would be located on a flat
steel base on a beach within easy driving distance from Salt Lake City.
Asked why the sculpture was not located closer to =B3Spiral Jetty,=B2 the lake=B9=
s
world-renowned sculpture by the late Robert Smithson, Salty Dog
representatives indicated that they did not want to sow any visual or
critical confusion with the other work.

=B3Our platform of the figures of Bush and Blair will only resemble  =8CJetty=B9
in the way the seasonal level of the lake=B9s water will also rise to cover
the work,=B2 Salty Dog Production said. =B3Occasionally, the public will not be
able to see the figures at all. As the figures re-emerge, additional salt
will have further encrusted their shapes to re-introduce another cycle of
purification. It will be a process that the American and an International
public can take years to witness and appreciate.=B2

According to the press release, site drawings and location will be released
as soon as State authorities approve the plans and location and agree to
provide all other required permissions.

Colum McCann is the author of Dancer, This Side of Brightness, Everything in
this Country Must, Songdogs, and Fishing the Sloe-Back River. He has won the
Grace Kelly Memorial  Foundation Award, the Hennessy Prize, the Rooney
Prize, a Pushcart Prize, and has been a finalist for the IMPAC award. His
most recent novel is Dancer, which earned the follwing from Publishers
Weekly: "A chorus of voices breathe new life into the story of Rudolf
Nureyev, one of ballet's greatest performers, in this vibrant, imaginative
patchwork of a novel by Irish expatriate McCann. Faithfully capturing the
pathos and grim poverty of the Soviet Union at mid-century, McCann also
reveals a splashy tabloid affinity for the excesses and effects of fame and
notoriety. ...[T]he novel is a lovely showcase for his fluid prose and
storytelling skill.

Joshua Corey is the author of Selah, which won him the Barrow Street Book
Prizefor 2003. Robert Pinsky says: "With Selah Joshua Corey joins a
generation of exciting first-book poets (Jennifer Clarvoe, Joanie Mackowski,
Cate Marvin come to mind) who apply the fundamental poetic gift of the ear,
in new ways. Sheer richness of language, and in the best poems cadences
layered like those of Wallace Stevens, guide the reader through Corey's
extravagant, playful, fantastical and profuse otherworld."

Dear Kari, I don't know if there's a problem using the word "hermaphrodite=

Kevin,

It has become painfully familiar to me that the right has targeted academia.
It doesn't matter after all what I think of the right.  What matters is that
votes count.  While some on this board think that they count more than others
because they can read, it isn't so.  Every body gets a vote.  And the Reader's
Digest and U.S. News reaches a lot more voters than does the Poetics List at
SUNY.

Meanwhile, people here are writing poems that even nobody else on the list
wants to read.

I tend to read outside of this field, and don't care to have too many
intellectual snobs for friends.  My car mechanic catches these things and
sends them on to me, as does my pastor.  The fact is that virtually all of
America considers left-wing college professors to be good for laughs, and
nothing much else.

I am NOT saying that I prefer what passes for thought at the American
Enterprise Institute.

There are more than two equally stupid choices -- but anything outside those
two stupid choices can't win an election in this country.  And whoever wins
will attempt to remake the country in their own stupid image.  I think it pays
to see who the new ogre is going to be, and what they are going to try to
enforce on us.

As for the Calvinists and the leftists, I say a plague on both your houses --

Kevin...

yes... case by case basis.,.. but never banning or burning.. it is more
the context /content.. ... and like the review / blurb . . . I think it
is easy and cheap and maybe down right thoughtless to go "banging"
those terms around.. it would be  as if I said...  "and its like if so
and so was sos and so and then converted to_______  (pick the
religion). cutlrue or ethnicity-.. its easy to use sexual minority as
stereo type .. its so "retro"... I can hear the cards and letters
coming now folks... but I guess it's ok to make assumptions about
"trans" flokz and queers in general... its one of the few places you
can get a good stereo type this days.. the rest are off limits... what
ever ... but you are right...a blurb is a blurb... and words have no
meaning.. so fuck . it right and let go out and get us the blow torch
and go get'us some of them...______........

Kirby: I think your pastor exceeds his function when he sends you political
screeds. You should ask him to stop and try to balance your political
reading. Your car mechanic is within his rights, however.

It might also help if you stopped seeing rather diverse groups as
monolithic. That's even true of Calvinists (a term that I think hasn't
until now appeared in political discussions since the 17th century).

Technically, I'm a lapsed Calvanist, Mark.  It's one of my
cards-of-identity.

Behind me (somehow, like smallpox vaccination, it never took on me) are two
generations of Church of Scotland Calvanist ministers.

But as you say, even Calvanists aren't monolithic.  The Wee Frees would have
considered both my father and my grandfather heretics.

This goes back to the Disruption in 1843 in Scotland, when the Free Kirk
split from the Established Church, but it's still alive and well and living
in the Highlands and Islands.   Especially Tighnabruaich.

I don't find contemporary criticism that works in that way any longer.
Perhaps it exists, but I can't find it.  It seems rather that race,
gender, class (and especially the first two) are what seem to matter in
terms of canonization in terms of what little poetic criticism continues
to be written. The yardstick, in other words, appears to be politics,
while a smattering of lip service is given to aesthetics.  I want to
find an aesthetically driven poetic criticism if it still exists.

The French surrealists discussed the beauty of an image from the
viewpoint of the power of striking contrasts.

The Catholics after St. Thomas have talked about complexity and
coherence.

I was happy to see Tom Bell and others talking about the aesthetics of
Anne Coulter -- and how she didn't deserve to be in the NY Times on the
basis of her lack thereof.  What exactly then are the AESTHETIC
standards of today?  Can these still be presented within longer works
and still be foregrounded?  Is there a universal aesthetics that can
still be used to discriminate against not only Anne Coulter, but also
against leftists who lack subtlety and nuance -- as are missing for
instance in Karl Marx's poems?

Can anybody give me examples of Contemporary poetry critics who attempt
to create universal standards of judgement by which one poet, or one
poem, is considered to be superior to another -- and where the
principles are clearly articulated not in terms of politics, but in
terms of beauty, the sublime, or even ugliness?  that is, can anybody
still say why Marianne Moore is the better poet than Ella Wheeler
Wilcox?

You're going to have a difficult time trying to rhyme either word with
orange. Other than that, it's a matter of personal sensitivity--yours as a
writer and that of the people who read it. Someone will be offended no
matter how sensitive you try to be. Write with your heart and take the hit,
if one comes.

there once was a hermaphrodite from poughkeepsie
who got on a bike with a gypsy
their visors were orange
not covered with porridge
so I shouted "Thurprithe" with a lispy

i think the rhyme scheme breaks the confrontational gap some of us have when trying to rhyme hermaphrodite, even though i never rhyme hermaphrodite; but i do orange!

I know there has been much discussion going back and forth with the word
"hermaphrodite" and its usage and talk of  inter-sexed being or trans
gendered being.  (NOT the same thing...)

I did want to say that TRANS people face continual violence and
discrimination to an horrifyingly extreme in our society, and that if all
the terms are unfamiliar to any of you I would suggest STARTING anywhere and
reading...

Kate Bornstein
Leslie Feinberg
Judith Halberstam
any, many writers (not so many poets that I know of, but kari edwards can
start you off)


It is a serious and not always publicized issue of civil rights and
liberties and NOT to mention, language usage, that all the "well intentioned
liberals" might examine their blind spots for --- if we thought Cixous and
Wittig and others had something to say about feminism in the binary
oppositions of language, believe me there is a lot MORE to say about the
binaries not only assuming "a one up and one down" opposition, but just
IMAGINE not being able to name oneself in the world of pronouns at all---
and NO this is not just about IMAGINING oneself in the so called "opposite"
gender's high heels or hush puppies....

and of course in this case my grammar must go to hell-- those rules ain't
applying!

In Spring of 2000, Hoa Nguyen and Dale Smith were
generous enough to publish a poem of mine entitled
"The Hermaphrodite in Literature" in their literary
journal, ~Skanky Possum~ # 4.  Here's the text:



THE HERMAPHRODITE IN LITERATURE

To appreciate the resonance of that title fully:
the starlike flowers of the pimpernel
close in bad weather.  A laquered Japanese fan
is flicked open with a snap of the wrist, and the
he-she,
giggling off-key, shrinks behind accordion-pleated
pictures of mimosas.  The world reaches only so far,
and then the rest is a jagged line, dragons,
plummeting.
It rests on the humps of four elephants.

Her Adam's apple bobs up and down like a barometer
as she snickers.  It strikes her funny that
barbers install candycane poles outside their shops
to remind her of her homeland's national costume,
the wooden shoes they danced in, the merry maypole.
Everyone was happy back then, dark sunshine
everywhere.

She---he?---tells me more about cosmogony and
planispheres.
I am cautious not to embarrass her, for fear of
her fists, molded into gloves several sizes too small,
for fear of shattering the frangible equipoise
of the moment, a little past noon, clock tower
trembling.
She knows ahead of time whenever it will rain,
from the consistency of her stools, yellow or black.
For the latter, her doctor leeches her choler
with bloodsuckers, then flings the parasites into
the nearest spittoon.  She hasn't been feeling well
lately, ever since she heard the news.
Those boys had made such handsome grenadiers.
She won't go out in public after nightfall: too many
bats.

Morning's water soaked. Holding forth
of words holding forth. Long-legged

kill yammer in mainstream. Get ‘em

Each thinking a hobby holding forth
every door a mother. In just proportion
what words appear there are. My blort.

Third dimension, that must be observed through physical comprehension
It takes a nerve to be struck, wisdom is the wise
Poet spoken to wake up, the dumb who’ve been sleeping
The fourth dimension is time, it goes inside the mind
Run the channels energized up through the back of your spine
So observe as my g energy strikes a vital nerve
One swerve of the tongue it pierces like a sword through the lung
Have you not heard, that words kill as fast as bullets
When you load negative thoughts, to the chamber of your brain
And your mouth pulls the trigger that propels
Wickedness straight from hell"

Small Press Traffic presents
Friday, November 21, 2003 at 7:30 p.m.
Mytili Jagannathan & Rodney Koeneke

Mytili Jagannathan was selected for a Pew Fellowship in 2002; her work has
appeared in Xcp: Cross Cultural Poetics, Combo, Interlope, and Mirage; and is
forthcoming in the anthology Cities of Chance: An Anthology of New Poetry from
the United States and Brazil (Rattapallax). She joins us from Philadelphia in
celebration of the publication of her chapbook, ACTS (habenicht press). From
her poem "Score"; "my hand deliberately//is that a safe space//is that our
signatures intertwined."

K. Silem Mohammad  on Rodney Koeneke?s first full-length collection, Rouge
State (Pavement Saw, 2003): "Cannily an(a)esthet(ic)izing the misogynist and
orientalist phantasms that are projected on the digital plateaux of its own
prosodic bravado, this is how Naked Lunch might have turned out if it had been
written by Robert Browning having a sex-change operation. There can be but one
sordid bordello of this magnitude, and Koeneke has erected it squarely at the
fissure where the simulacral Middle America of Pop Warner and bubble top vans
collides with a paracolonial hallucination of Eastern inscrutability inhabited
by five-dollar houris and hack oud players. These elegant verses have teeth."
Koeneke?s one of our favorite San Franciscans.

As a readings coordinator and a reviewer, I receive press kits, albeit
mostly from local performance poets or from small presses publishing
religious fiction.

However, as a person continually looking for readings, I am also asked
for books, which cost me abt $10 each, quite a hefty fee for something
apparently expected to be send to everyone, and press kits, which I am
attempting to gradually improve, in order to be booked for a reading,
festival / book fair appearance, etc.

Thus far, my press kit consists of:

a printout of an author photo (not an actual headshot) with the flip
side printed with the parts of my cv / resume about me-as-an-author,

a color printout (not an actual offprint) of my book jacket with the
flipside printed with the parts of my cv / resume about the book,

a floppy (sticker of book front cover as label) containing the .pdf of
the book,

sometimes some sample postcards and other handouts from readings (lists
of songs, artists, or etc. I've got in my book),

sometimes CDs,

a cover letter.

1) what else should be in or out?

2) is there a better way to go about this?

3) any readings coordinators, book festival bookers, reviewers, out
there want one?

I would say of Kasey's remarks on "Rouge State" that the _lusus naturae_ (a
Latin phrase from which we in English get the expression "freak of nature")
is necessary for any working critical vocabulary. How else to describe
divergence from prior norms? Especially if we recall that "freak" in this
connection originally meant "sport or frolic." Do we think of artistic
innovation as a slow & work-like process, or a fun and showy -- and what is
more, *involuntary* -- deviance from the prescribed norm?

True that it is no fun to see one's own brand of freakiness used by the
non-freaky as a metaphorical resource. Not very much fucking fun at all. I
would go on to say that such usage is inevitable, in that some kinds of
freakiness serve as the conceptual pattern for categories that we think
with every day. For example, it might be that we only understand hybridity
through the figure of the hermaphrodite. Or it might not. In any event,
Kasey's remarks are better grasped when you read them in the context of the
entire sentence:

"Cannily an(a)estheticizing the misogynist and orientalist phantasms that
are projected on the digital plateaux of its own prosodic bravado, this is
how Naked Lunch might have turned out if it had been written by Robert
Browning having a sex-change operation." Kind of deepens it, don't you
think? Notice also that the trans-gender is deployed here in order to talk
about the aestheticized phantasm, and not the form. So what's being called
queer or hybrid here is the engendering imagination. Which is rather a
compliment, in the city where I slept last night!

This question has been on my mind lately, as I was trying to think of
something to say about my new favorite cartoonist (Ben Jones), who draws
and writes as if he were mentally disabled, or holding a gasoline-soaked
rag to his mouth. How's that for an abusive set of comparanda? But I
challenge you to describe his style more accurately. And I have a follow-up
question: when we describe an artist's work as "poor," what do we mean? LRSN

The true method is not to seek the sign of truth *after* the acquisition
of ideas. To do so is to be afraid to confess one exists.

When one acquires the idea that such-n-such an artist's work is 'poor'
and then 'goes on'  (ie. Mark 5:37) to 'describe' it (a sign) one doubts
the truth one already possesses.

So, in essence, to answer your question, when one describes an artist's
work as 'poor' one means nothing. (objectively, or with certainty)



"It is finished"

not entirely, since I think "gentiles" here means generally not of the
tribe, rather than not Jewish.  personally I rather be a gentile than a
barbarian which is how the Greeks put it, basing it on the fact that any
language besides Greek sounding like you were saying "Bar-bar."

Web sites are, in my view, a necessity, but they are not a part of any
but an electronic press kit.

However (and this is part of what I think the web is for), it is quite
common for performance poets and agented authors and authors on huge
presses to have press kits -- either print-out-able as a press kit (all
the info in a clean and simple format or in an attached .pdf) or an
"online press kit" as part of their sites.

Susan Wheeler, Thalia Field, Shelley Jackson, Jeanne Beaumont's presence
at WW Norton, and the Janet Holmes / Rachel Loden / Stephanie Strickland
site at pomegranate were author websites I looked at particularly
carefully as far as the run of what most authors have made or make vs.
what they are generally provided.  This is quite different from the
better "academic / author" website like Juliana Spahr's, IMO.

The press kit for the performance poets generally includes sound files,
links to poems, links to reviews, self-published or self-reprinted
(electronically) poems, links to the blog, poetics statements, a
schedule / calendar of dates, etc.

Among my models for the press kit were those on Iris Berry's, Exene
Cervenka's, Daphne Gottlieb's, and some other websites, although mine is
not that glossy right now.

A pet peeve of mine is noncommercial authors with a ".com" rather than
another (noncommercial) extension.

Hello,

A friendly reminder about tomorrow's lectures, the very first evening
of the New Research Lecture Series put on by myself and Charles
Mudede.

Jerry Garcia will be delivering a stunning digital image presentation
of his new architectural project.  Greg Lundgren will pull himself
away
from directing his mega-successful play, "I Am An Artist" to muse
about
his multi-million dollar project proposal, the Pave Project.

In addition, it's free, and sure to be much cozier than outside.

7:30 - 9pm, Polestar Music Gallery

***********
The Brazilian congress is now voting on a project that will reduce the
Amazon forest to 50% of its size. It will take 1 MINUTE to read this, but
PLEASE put your names on the list and forward this on as instructed below.

The area to be deforested is 4 times the size of Portugal and would be
mainly used for agriculture and pastures for livestock. All the wood is to
be sold to international markets in the form of wood chips, by large
multinational companies.

The truth is that the soil in the Amazon forest is useless without the
forest itself. Its quality is very acidic and the region is prone to
constant floods.
At this time more than 160,000 square kilometers deforested with the same
purpose are abandoned and in the process of becoming deserts, meaning that
this proposal is in the short-term interests of a few, and in the long term
interests of none.

Please copy the text into a 'new e-mail' put your complete name in the list
below, and send to everyone you know to help stop the "Deforestation of
Brazil".
(DON'T JUST FORWARD IT - AS IT WILL THEN END UP WITH ROWS AND ROWS of '>'s)

It is at least probably so that parental behaviors such as severe punitive
beatings are more likely to create a sociopath than is a word in a poem that
almost nobody will read?

I'm not convinced that there is a strong correlation between representations in
art and actions later carried out by any given audience.

People who are crazy enough to kill another person haven't been driven crazy by
a word in a poem is my guess.  It would probably take years and years of
research in laboratories, and lots and lots of violent poems read to otherwise
docile individuals to test this.

Most researchers that I've read have claimed that it is severe parental abuse
over a prolonged period that makes a person turn violent in adulthood.
Criminologists have said that 99% of violent criminals have had a violent
childhood.

But perhaps poetry is at fault, and is an overlooked source of violence in our
society.  Whether individual words in poems play a major role in the creation of
sociopaths would be difficult to test, however.

But maybe the rise in an unexpurgated language in our poetry is responsible for
the high crime-rate.

Perhaps we'd better go back to the Victorian language of Tennyson just to be
safe?  Or just stop writing altogether?

Not only should the second amendment be amended, but more seriously the first?

Keep the gun shops open, but destroy all writing implements?

Well, perhaps if this was tried over a period of say twenty years we could then
see the outcome and compare it to the previous twenty years.

This thesis could be true.  And headlines such as this one that have been
plaguing us for years

POETRY BUFF KILLS ANOTHER HERMAPHRODITE!

could be changed to:

DISAPPEARANCE OF POETRY LEADS TO UNIVERSAL PEACE!

There's only one way to test it.  We must enforce absolutely safe nice poems
with the death penalty.

I'm trying to track down and verify the following information, which =
someone might know something about. A local historian, i.e. the fixture =
at the local pub, was telling a rapt audience that the first =
congressional medal of honor in WWII was bestowed on an American airman =
who in essence was a terrorist who perpetrated a kamikaze mission on a =
Japanese warship, killing himself and the entire crew of the ship. He =
was apparently lauded, posthumously, as a patriot and a hero by the =
president and by congress. Since the last thing I heard from this =
particular raconteur had to do with the thriving black market for =
internal organs in Hartford, I'm dubious, so I wonder if anyone can =
confirm. If true, certainly this offers further illumination re: the =
storied history of American foreign policy.=20

Greenboathouse Books News :: v.6.o7
Variant 3 Contributions Now Posted


A new Greenboathouse initiative, Variant invites writers to respond in
poetic, lyric or narrative form to a "trigger"; a passage from a book,
poem, theoretical text (or billboard for that matter) posted on-line to
which writers respond in whatever direction they're drawn.


The "trigger" for Round 3 was a quote from Steve McCaffery's Panopticon:

"Millions of things are the same as this."

Selected by assistant editor Aaron Peck, this round includes new poems
by Sina Queyras, derek beaulieu, Jason Dewinetz, Ariel Gordon and Simon
Spiechert.


And, in case you're feeling adventurous, here's the "trigger" for Round
4, from Lisa Robertson's The Weather:

"Now we are persons breaking open. The real is not enough to pleasure
us."

Round 4 Submission Deadline: January 31, 2004
(for submission guidelines, please visit our site).

RS,
Seems the chap providing the entertainment may have had some =
misinformation.

The first U.S. pilot awarded the MOH in WWII was Butch O'hare (think =
Chicago's airport) who shot down 6 enemy planes to protect an advancing =
fleet and the carrier Lexington from enemy air attack.  Medal date =
activity: 2/20/42.  As I recall reading, the medal was awarded =
posthumously, for the ace didn't make it back from that battle. =20

None of the Air Force men, officers or enlisted, were ever awarded the =
MOH for kamikaze attacks on an enemy ship...and it's highly unlikely =
(though I've not yet concluded the search) that any marine or navy =
pilots did the deed and were so awarded.  If I find something to =
substantiate the tale, I'll let you know.=20

In the FYI department, though, I'm amused at the illogical link between =
calling the Kamikaze pilots terrorists.  These were uniformed combatants =
of the Emperor, armed with an airplane as their weapon of choice, and =
fully open and public in their attempts to launch their weapons.  =
Terrorists, OTOH, sneak around disguised as innocent, non-combatants; =
they then bomb and kill other non-combatants. =20

While I'm certain the dead folk don't get hung up on the difference =
between overt and covert attackers, I do see a blatant distinction =
myself, and couldn't put a uniformed combatant carrying out orders in =
the same league as say the soldiers of the American Revolution who wore =
no uniforms, hid behind trees and rocks and sniped at the Red coats who =
marched in formation to the battle.  But then, who would ever dare refer =
to a patriot as a terrorist?

  I'm trying to track down and verify the following information, which =
someone might know something about. A local historian, i.e. the fixture =
at the local pub, was telling a rapt audience that the first =
congressional medal of honor in WWII was bestowed on an American airman =
who in essence was a terrorist who perpetrated a kamikaze mission on a =
Japanese warship, killing himself and the entire crew of the ship. He =
was apparently lauded, posthumously, as a patriot and a hero by the =
president and by congress. Since the last thing I heard from this =
particular raconteur had to do with the thriving black market for =
internal organs in Hartford, I'm dubious, so I wonder if anyone can =
confirm. If true, certainly this offers further illumination re: the =
storied history of American foreign policy.=20

really...  who are you to speak to the 40,000 trans floks here in sf...
thats right 40,000.. how many have you known and worked with... I can
say I have worked with at least 300 hundred or more as a therapist and
many more as activist..  had some as lovers, and business
partners..come on now..... you can speak for an entire city... how
amazing.. simply amazing...  I am tried of this kind of arrogance
...... unless you know as many trans flokz and have worked with
hundreds as I have, taught classes on trans theory and done research on
trans and gender diverse history... I would say this is a arrogant
stereo typical response....

> Kind of deepens it, don't you
> think?

you do not get it.. when you throw out a word like sex-change in a
hetronormative society   it receives a  very limited read, a very
stereo typical read... I dare you to do it with flokz of color..... ...
maybe it is your own unexamined male gaze that is limited you.. and
your own unexamined construction of gender as solid........ it is also
funny on this list how everyone has this quick answers.. but few self
identify.... the first lesson in making a level playing field is to
state when one is coming from.. but no.. lets all speak from righteous
arrogance..... how may are straight white males making these
assumptions about queers and language...... and dont come out and state
it......are you also speaking for the Iraqis... or is that just a
metaphor.. for a another level of what is happening in washington\\\

do you even examine what  it mean sex change.. from man to woman .. so
binary of you thank you... lets keep it black and white... good and
bad.. so simple right, so what is a woman and what is man? ... when you
cut some ones cock off and that means something . . . is that it is
that all that makes a man is a cock and you cut it off and they become
something different-.. it show your limited understainding of gender..
how silly... a sex change is cosmetic!!!!!! it means nothing ... you
still see gender as cock and clit... that is your read

> Robert
> Browning having a sex-change operation



if not what does it mean.. it is meaningless. unless you use simplistic
binary think man and woman...  talk about a limited use of language and
an inability to see how gender  language works.... if you are going to
rely on simple myth of gender / words it becomes a very lazy use of
language..

Hi kari!

Arrogant I accept, cheerfully. The rest? I don't know, I rather stick by
what I said, and I'm uninclined to add to it or subtract. Or apologize for
my "heteronormative" (?) status. Will it inflame you, or make you smile, if
I remind you how beautifully you "passed" the last time you & I sat at a
table together, while the waitress took me for a chick? (Edinburgh Castle.)

No, I will add something. Five or so years ago there was a big feminist
theory conference at U.C.Berkeley with the title "Resisting Dissymmetries."
Being blessed myself with an unignorably dissymmetrical face, I clenched in
anger every time I saw the posters for it. And yet I can't think of a
better word for describing the unevenness of the rights and rewards that
society grants to "women" and "men." Unless it's "dimorphism," which means
the same thing to LRSN

Good points about the difficulty of self-naming for trans people, Julie.

But I think it's kind of hard to avoid using the word "hermaphrodite" in a
poem (or at least implying it behind the poem) if you're at all influenced
by Bretonian surrealism, and who isn't -- at least a little bit? It might
also be useful to point out here that there are various transgendered myths
and deities that have been around for a long time and that may in some
cases transcend (or move in dialectic with) the instance of the individual
transgendered person or body.

Best,

Tim

I know there has been much discussion going back and forth with the word
"hermaphrodite" and its usage and talk of  inter-sexed being or trans
gendered being.  (NOT the same thing...)

I did want to say that TRANS people face continual violence and
discrimination to an horrifyingly extreme in our society, and that if all
the terms are unfamiliar to any of you I would suggest STARTING anywhere and
reading...

It is a serious and not always publicized issue of civil rights and
liberties and NOT to mention, language usage, that all the "well intentioned
liberals" might examine their blind spots for --- if we thought Cixous and
Wittig and others had something to say about feminism in the binary
oppositions of language, believe me there is a lot MORE to say about the
binaries not only assuming "a one up and one down" opposition, but just
IMAGINE not being able to name oneself in the world of pronouns at all---
and NO this is not just about IMAGINING oneself in the so called "opposite"
gender's high heels or hush puppies....

and of course in this case my grammar must go to hell-- those rules ain't

I agree with Kevin -- this blurb makes me feel kinda icky, and I think that
it might be because the transgendered element here is being used as a kind
of "bad-boy chic" or "punk" element of otherness, evoking some of the
unpleasant overtones of Ginsberg's "running at dawn through the negro
streets looking for an angry fix." Except here you've got the sex-change
operation instead of "negro streets." I think we can probably blame Hedwig
for contributing to this aesthetic.

deep work we need to do since the tools we use are so loaded... it
seems to be blame is  easy... I will not be attending the reading this
friday... and let SPT know why... we need to take responsibility for

The two examples are I think very different, tho both derive from a sense
of otherness. Kasey's seems like a bad case of misdirected cleverness,
since, aside from being offensive, it's essentially meaningless--it conveys
no sense of the book, except to suggest outrageousness--one arm of the
comparison is supposed to be unimaginably strange. I mean, if the point of
comparison is Naked Lunch how are we to imagine that it would have been
different?

In Ginsberg's case it's a question of change in what's considered
offensive. "Negro streets" presumably refers to Harlem or Bed Sty, the
darkness of the night, and danger, but it's also hipster talk and positions
the writer in that world. And it's using other people for their value as
exotic.

Something like 30 years ago I used the phrase "spades in shades" in a long
poem. It makes me cringe now, but at the time no one picked up on it,
including black friends. Cool jazz idiom. Same problems as Allen's phrase.
Recently I discussed this with the editor who'd published the poem all
those years ago. She was horrified, but at the time the phrase had just
flowed past her. I'm talking about a crowd of lefties, all of whom had been
active in the civil rights movement, some even passing freedom summer in
Mississippi. In a recent republication I changed it--lost some of the music
and evocativeness, but of course some of what it evoked was very far from
my intention.

It would be interesting to know how the then Leroy Jones, who was in
Allen's circle, reacted to the phrase at the time.

From Bush's major address in London today. These two paragraphs (below from
the speech) - to me - project the substance of what I suspect his writers
would call "vision." "Iron Hammer", the name of the current crackdown in
Bagdad, or "my pistol and leadership before yours", or "pre-emption": a
close reading renders the subtext, or, what is probably called "the
message."  (i.e., no surprise here):
"Our first choice, and our constant practice, is to work with other
responsible governments. We understand as well that the success of
multilateralism is not measured by adherence to forms alone, the tidiness of
the process, but by the results we achieve to keep our nations secure.
The second pillar of peace and security in our world is the willingness of
free nations, when the last resort arrives, to retain (sic/restrain)
aggression and evil by force. There are principled objections to the use of
force in every generation, and I credit the good motives behind these views.
Those in authority, however, are not judged only by good motivations. The
people have given us the duty to defend them, and that duty sometimes
requires the violent restraint of violent men. In some cases, the measured
use of force is all that protects us from a chaotic world ruled by force."

Facts on the ground in Baghdad and Iraq are more indicative of somebody who
has stuck and fired his pistol in his mouth: the language shatters into
pieces upon investigation. "Pillars" it appears made of sand.

I am not sure what and when, if any, alternative language will emerge to
lead "us" out of this quagmire. I suspect not from the mouths of Blair and
Bush who, joined at the hip, remain religiously faithful to these fictions
of folly. Perhaps, mouths from above boots on the ground (as with the former
Israeli Security heads rejection of Sharon's Occupation of Palestine, or the
Italian Administrator  who resigned his position in Baghdad over the deaths
and US administrative quagmire and religio-ethnocentric arrogance) will dam
the torpedoes and bring some sense back into a non-Occupational vision of
global relations. I want to be optimistic. I wish I were in London
demonstrating.

well i'm bummed out you're going to miss the
reading -- i respect your standing up for
something you obviously believe in deeply, but i
respectfully submit that

a) while the blurbage is at best unhelpful (to me
anyway) in describing rodney's work (i mean i read
naked lunch, i like robert browning, but, huh?),
perhaps lazy, and at worst insensitive in all the
ways you describe, it certainly wasn't meant as a
deliberate swipe at transgendered folks. and no, i
don't speak for them or anyone else, least of all
kasey, i'm just stating what seems to me an
objective fact.

b) you say to blame is easy, who then is to blame
for this? is spt at fault for hosting the reading,
are you going to boycott every reading that rodney
gives for his new book? gosh, i hope not.

kari, i respect you a lot, i value your
friendship, and i value all the points that have
come up as a result of this, but i think it's too
bad that you're going to let this keep you from
coming to see rodney and mytili read this friday
night...

best,

DH

The response to the offer of Factory School Digital Audio Library's 2-disk
set has been such that we decided to honor all 35+ requests that arrived
as of 4pm Wednesday, November 19. All requests will be shipped within the
next few days. In some cases, people requested the set even though they
were going to receive it by prior arrangement.

Though this archive is being distributed at no cost, it is hoped that
generous souls will be willing to make donations (paypal address:
custodian@factoryschool.org) to the cause, especially since overseas
shipping is likely to be prohibitively expensive. Another way one can help
would be to order books from Bill Marsh (b-theater@factoryschool.org) or
through SPD.

It is hoped that the spirit of this offering will encourage others to link
up with this collective project by making available audio recordings
whether on tape, LP, or digital format to be included in the archive. We
hope this spontaneous donation to the Poetics List community will lead to
increased awareness of the Factory School project.  Join up, and "build
your own factory." For more information about how to participate, please
contact custodian@factoryschool.org.

Please direct all inquiries regarding this offer to
engineering-dept@factoryschool.org. Thanks for your interest and happy
listening!

Skin-Changing


[photograph] "WATCHING A SNAKE FAIRY CHANGING HIS SKIN" (With handwriting:
"They watched me while I changed my skin.") [from THE FAIRYLAND AROUND US
by Opal Stanley Whiteley, Typed and Proofed by David Caruso, 1999]

She watched him while he changed his skin. He watched her while she
changed her skin. He watched her while she changed his skin. She watched
him while he changed her skin.

There's something about this skin-changing. There's something about shape-
riding here but it's unclear. Everyone who reads Opal falls in love with
her. "I have read Opal and have fallen in love with her."

Accordingly of one book, everyone who has fallen in love with her of the
reading of her remembers when he has first read the book as a date of
falling in love.

It is an account of skin-changing and the reading of it is a skin-chang-
ing. This is a talisman of this reading and a magic-card.

Cut out the magic-card from the screen and carry it with you alway and you
will be skin-changing of everyone and everyone will be skin-changing of
you.

To all:

At the risk of sticking my nose in where it doesn't belong,I have to second
David (and others') assertion that Kasey's intent was not to offend with his
blurb. He has, in fact, apologized for his careless use of language to some
of the folks who have questioned him about it on his blog.

I am in the process of learning, slowly, to change pronouns for a
transgendered friend of mine who has just begun a hormone regimen. Until I
began this switchover I had no idea just how difficult it would be to make
such a change, despite the fact that I care for my friend and am deeply
empathetic to the trouble he's had making this transition with his family
and others. It seems simple on the surface of things: just change she to he,
her to him. If only it were are easy as "find and replace."

As writers we are certainly bound to be more responsible than most with how
we use language. But I'd like to suggest that we are just as responsible for
our understanding and interpretation of language and in our regard for the
intent behind the words, especially those spoken or written by our fellows.
When I slip up and refer to my friend by the wrong pronoun, it doesn't mean
I don't care for him. It means I need to try harder and speak and write more
thoughtfully. I make mistakes. I endeavor to do better. Ignorance (though
I'm not suggesting Kasey is ignorant) is vastly removed from malice.
Ignorance has a simple remedy: education and patience. Malice we haven't
found a cure for yet.

Incidentally, Kasey is a fan of yours kari
(http://limetree.ksilem.com/archives/000329.html) and I'm sure he would be
sorry to know that he's inadvertently upset you (and others who have
commented here). I don't think he's a member of this list, but I bet
directly communicating with him would help clear up this misunderstanding.

Shanna

*****
Ian Stewart, writing on Chaos Theory in Does God Play Dice, illustrates how
long-term (and in many cases, short term) weather prediction is impossible
because in order to function, the mathematical system must round off
decimals. These decimals, which are unaccounted for in the prediction, grow
and change the entire system. This is now generally understood as the
butterfly effect. However, the butterfly effect is often misunderstood as
the unknown element, or the exterior. As the above example indicates, this
is not the case.

In other words, the butterfly is within and all systems contain their own
viruses that are dormant, waiting to disrupt all impositions. Word-virus is
the resurfacing of the excess of language and meaning that has been
“rounded-off” in order to create institutions & hierarchies.
*****
I is my self-iterating
*****
Word-virus is not a mass consumed good. In fact, the whole gamut of
consumption is a banal attempt at sanitation. Mass consumption requires
consistency, and word-virus undermines that consistency. A Mcpoem is not a
word-virus, but it may be a cheap rip-off of the real thing, or a
re-presentation.
*****
Deleuze & Guattarri are talking internet.
*****
The mendelbrot set is complex, but not complicated. It only requires
approximately ten lines of program to create, but the result is a fractal
that is infinite, unpredictable, and closed in that it does not extend
outward.
(Again, Ian Stewart)
*****
God only requires three letters.
*****
The corporate structure and the government act together as a condom through
which safe-thinking is possible. Like condoms, they come in a variety of
colors & shapes & produce many sensations, but they always serve the same
function. They are a firewall to prevent word-virus.
*****
It involves another language
No, it involves languages acting together in an entirely different
structure.
*****
Word-virus must be stopped at the door of the house. Word-virus cannot come
in contact with the sanctity of the home & the family, because it will
destroy the virginity of the next generation. War is always about children
and their genitalia.

Shanna mentioned that she didn't know whether I was on this list: I am, but
I've been in digest mode for the past few weeks, so I haven't been followin=
g
the controversy around my blurb for Rodney Koeneke's _Rouge State_ very
closely.  Jeffrey Jullich did post to the comment box on my blog
(http://limetree.ksilem.com) with an excerpt from Kevin Killian's original
message, and I responded with the following comment:

---
"I'm sorry if that comment registers as insensitivity.  It was meant to
convey, in a general way, the destabilized status of unified identity--any
identity, whether gendered, racial, romantic, quietudist, post-avantist--in
Rodney's writing.  But I can see how it might come off as 'sex-change
operation, ooh yeah, that's weird and FREAKY!'  Which was not my intention
at all.  But I should be more careful.

In general, however, I'm aware that I return again and again to sensitive
issues around gender in my writing.  This is in part an outgrowth of Flarf,
with its insistence on probing tender social sores by recording belligerent
public web noise.  The blurb, however, is not Google-generated, so I can=B9t
appeal to that defense.  All I can say is that I can't keep away from it.=A0
It wants to be in there, in the poems, in the gossip and promotional
rhetoric.  I am an impure vessel.=A0 I will not try to disown my blemishes.=A0
Maybe homophobia is a pathology I feel a need to rehearse in various modes,
from blatant satiric irony to confrontational exorcistic spasms.=A0 I don't
know.=A0 I'm just improvising, all of this stuff, it's on the fly, it's what'=
s
in my brain, right or wrong.  I'm happy to talk it out and to hear
criticisms."
---

It dismays me to hear that my blurb has inspired kari edwards to boycott
Rodney's reading: both because Rodney and Mytili Jagannathan (the other
reader) don't deserve it, and because I regret offending kari, whom I admir=
e
as a person and writer.  If I could change the blurb now, I would.

This all concerns me on a broader scale, however.  I have used the language
of different kinds of bigotry (gendered, racial, political, religious, etc.=
)
in my own poetry many times before this (Jeffrey has objected before as
well), and I will probably continue to do so.  I do it with absolutely no
intention of deepening the wounds already inflicted on the victims of that
bigotry.  I can't say that I have a consistently coherent philosophy of wha=
t
exactly my use of this language *is* supposed to achieve, if anything, but =
I
do feel some obligation as an artist not to flinch from it, since my
intuitions lead me toward it.  I have to follow it and see where it goes.

I would be very disappointed if my adherence to this project--which I see n=
o
way of swerving from--were to alienate me to some of the other artists whos=
e
work and opinions I respect.  I would hope that their objections might be
expressed through open critical dialogue (of the sort that Kevin originally
invited, for example) rather than closed gestures of resentment.  I
understand kari's anger, and I don't feel personally threatened by it.  I
do, however, object to some of Jeffrey's recent cryptic comments, in which
the focus was off the original issue (the blurb) and, irrationally and
offensively, on members of my family and a recent traumatic experience they
went through (????).  I have never been anything other than civil in my
communication with Jeffrey, and I expect the same respect in return.

This quote from the London Independent (Thursday)  about Bush's tour of

Stephen,

I've had to read through this a few times to work out what the 'moral' of
this little anecdote is. The journalist may be being deliberately oblique
here as the topic sentence about "free[ing] subjected  people from tyranny"
is clearly at odds with Victoria's diary. My reading is that the passage is
a comment about the descent of American Civilization - still an unfair
remark, though not comparison you see. Perhaps the writer was trying to
obscure this little piece of "anti-Americanism"?

At any rate, the Independent was, when I was in the UK, a Liberal paper in
the literal sense of the word. I seriously doubt that they would consider
the war and occupation of Iraq a liberation.

In re-reading my post I realize I created a confusion by implying that the
"Liberation" point of view is that of the Independent. No, the Queen
pointing out the Uncle Tom exhibit piece to George Bush, I understood to be
make her point about the US emancipation of the slaves as somehow relevant
to present and future joint Brit-American emancipations in Iraq & Muslim
elsewhere. The irony of George Bush's touted association with his "southern
roots" (read Christian and "pull the race card" right wing) is perhaps lost
on the Queen - or why George move gingerly and quick past the Uncle Tom
volume,  not engaging the Queen Victoria quote at all (condescending though
it might have been, particularly in light of the British empire, Arab world
domination associations, etc.
Anyway, I think decoding this stuff is amazing. It goes on beyond this. How
about the fact he delivered his "violent restraint" speech in a Palace
Building that was -if I understood it correctly - the site of an on-going
missile/rocket sales conference. And his audience - since they need to
create one -  were in large part the sales reps (one of whom called the
experience  "topping on the cake", I can only guess, in addition to good
sales.)

I guess a further weird thing is that it's possible (for me, anyway) to get
interpretively excited by these ironic juxtapositions, and at the same time
wonder if I am indulging for what to many (say a stereotypical Fox or CNN
audience) may have no irony whatsoever, and such critical activity would be
ignored as frivolous nonsense, possibly suspicious in tone, but definitely
irrelevant.  Heah, I doubt if I will stop.

Thanks for you comment, Ben.

having just worked for five years in a gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender,
feminist
bookstore, i'm well aware of how important language is to those who don't feel
safe, or respected.

but i'll be honest with you, now that i'm out of that environment, i'll NEVER
put
myself in such a place ever again, ever.  i'm glad the store is there, of
course,
it's an invaluable asset.  i'm just incredibly tired of the ownership of
language.

when someone tells you they have the keys to the language, you feel like a
visitor
in your own house.  that's my take on it.

one thing though about the sensitivity to words in such places, it's an
amazing
thing really, to see how uncomfortable words make people.

in the mid-80's when i was a young kid in a small, dirty little country
school, and was
outed, it was the dawn of AIDS, and words seemed essential, suddenly, to how
i felt about myself.  i'd take a drink from the water fountain and some
jock-pig would
put a "contaminated" sign on the fountain.

words were very uncomfortable, for me, and for them.

but the value of that discomfort is essential now to the way i hope for the
future of our
world and what should be limited.  limiting words, in my opinion, is far more
harmful,
far more dangerous than we may originally think.

putting red X's over words only works in the favor of the Right.

when the Queer campaign against Dr. Laura  Schlessinger was underway, to have
her television talk show taken off the air, i wrote letters in her defense.
there were PLENTY
of angry queers coming into the bookstore to give me hell, tell me i was an
idiot.

but Dr. Laura has EVERY right to say whatever the hell she wants to say.  you
canNOT
censor language without paying the price for it yourself one day.  it's
impossible!
our asses are on the line right now because of the chains the left wants to
place
on the language.  it's so VERY dangerous people!

when i get called a faggot these days, i look them in the eye, nod, and say
"Yeah,
that's right, i am.  so what?"  truth is, at that point, they know that if i
can say that,
that i'm very close to admitting that sucking cock is really quite delicious,
and i'm
not about to pretend it's not.  besides, what do they know about being a
faggot?
(well, being an out of the closet faggot at least)

look, i understand and respect the need to have a respectful use of language,
especially with your peers.  it's easy to feel uncomfortable and unsafe when
you
have peers who are using words which clearly disrespect your body, your life.
but as poets i feel we need to take a much larger stand, one that looks such
abuse in the face, and nods, fearless.  fear of language for poets, well,
it's not
making me feel like we're going to be able to extend every limb we need to
truly
write the strength of what is really (actually) inside us.

maybe the things inside us are fucking horrible!  should we not write them?
really?  should we ignore them?

allowing it all to be said, that's where i feel we can eventually find real
power.

My Dearest Kasey..

thank you for taking the time from your busy schedule with such a=20
wonderful thoughtful  responses.

  first to answer a few questions...

I am not ANGggery>..."at" you.. I find it insensitive-.. but I know=20
you... and I know it was not a malicious act....  insensitive . . . yes=20=

. . . uninformed... yes... . what I am AnngggRRRY with is the general=20
lack of sensitivity on the list..  as if it should be alright.. well.=20
it is not..

  to reiterate... one..

as you stated...

  that is fine.. but using the idea, concept or image of sex-change has=20=

little to do with destabilization of identity... and trust me I have=20
worked with this for a long time (please read: Stone, Sandy. "The=20
Empire Strikes Back: A Post-Transsexual Manifesto.).. the entire=20
history of sex-change is not based on the destabilization of gender but=20=

the  stabilization of gender through the medical establishment.....=20
please read your history books about the gender clinics of the=20
20-90s..even today.

if you were to you ask the majority of individuals what it means to=20
have a "sex  change", you will  inevitably hear...  it is to make one=20
into the other gender ( man to woman or woman to man/). . . . I know I=20=

have given over 60 lectures to business and schools around the=20
country... the key words here is "into the other".. not a floating=20
undefined signifiers. one gender to the next.. as if there is such a=20
thing.... As joan of arch said: I know not of a or b..

so by saying robert bowning after a sex change, implies robert becomes=20=

a woman-.. and so what is being said about women....?. there is little=20=

destabilization... now.. if robert browning became a top in a rotaional=20=

destabilization.. not some of the old same stuff.. lets be real.. using=20=

the masters tongue gets nowhere . . . now sex-change of a dog to a=20
cat..meow!!!




so that being said.. one of the two main reason I am not going to the=20
reading.. and lets not turn it into a boycott..!!!!!  heavy.. way to=20
dramatic.... ... I boycott nike....... is it is obvious no one is aware=20=

of the internal shame of being queer.. why would you, if you are not..=20=

queer.. .... it is easier to not be at a reading and have to deal with=20=

any of the implications-. even hints. but why would any one get gay=20
shame... if your STRAIGHT!!!!!... listen.. last week I read in=20
oakland.. two transfloks have been murdered there in the last few=20
months... did I feel safe there.. no... I am tried of not feeling=20
safe.. so I will sit this one out.. thank you

the other reason. all my professional life as a therapist and writer,=20
has been as an activist against the narrative read on gender (read:=20
http://www.sfsu.edu/~poetry/narrativity/issue_three/edwards.html)..I=20
have worked against this gender assumption of sex-reassignment surgery=20=

(or SRS - the correct medical term..by the way.. not sex-change.). and=20=

truly it is a shame... we live in a nation where.. a pepe and clit are=20=

still considered the true the markers of gender.. so someone having a=20
"sex-change" means something... I change my gender 20-30 times a day..=20=

doesn't everyone or is everyone out there so so so solid..

and no matter what . . . Dearhead nation does.. (which I love and=20
promoted in st. louis to a book store owner)..as an important and=20
funnnnyyy book... the blurb is not stated in the same way... and so out=20=

of principle.. so I will sit this one out.. thank you


and to answer some other questions.. who am I blaming.. this is not a=20
blame game... to do that the list would way to long and would go back=20
to the phallocentric behavior of the greeks.. and before... but I=20
digress... I think there are levels of responsibility.. I just read at=20=

Spt...and I have communicated with SPT..how I felt... I just wanted to=20=

questions, as much as disssing.. oh well... the work is never over ...=20=

I am uncomfortable with what is stated... I am raising the question...=20=

I am not comfortablegoing to the reading, there.. and I not going to=20
boyvcot Rodenys work or other readings...  I would like to have and=20
will have a discussion with Rodeny later ..

Good to remember that George's roots are in Southern Connecticut, tho he's
probably taught himself to believe that his family fought at the Alamo.

Recently a poem of mine was published in N.A.W.
the ending of which is
"as if growing up is a sex-change operation."

I say this now, because I didn't think of it as offensive when I wrote it,
and am wondering if I should so now.
Wondering if the line's context in the poem would "redeem" it
for those offended by Kasey's....

Stephen, and All--

Persistance & Shape: I really appreciate your persistance, Stephen, in posts
that point out some of the sad ironies of American political bullshit &
deadly actions, currently, as well as the historical ties & repercussions,
all of which continue to shape our lives.

Racism, et al: I would talk in particular about racism, if that were enough,
or even just what tops it all off.  But so much else is
all-American: class: a non signifier; and gender: and: and: basically it
looks as if the US does not know how to be, and then, how to be together.
But do these things matter, and if so, why?

Leader & His Dog: Did this un-knowing, disparate polity really want a leader
at all?--are terms like "leader" or "president" workable for such a place?
The example Stephen cites shows how basically George W. Bush is moot.  Yet
he seems to be counting on continued "public approval" for his presence.  He
never seriously regards anything that is real, least of all the stained &
strained historical vehicle that got him where he is. For him there is only
the calculated (the blunderous joke!), the orchestrated (White House lawn,
helicopter jog and Oh, hey! I tripped over my dog!); or there is the
ahistorical (redundant examples: the past does not matter for the present
and future of the US unless, and in the ways, I say).

Sweat & Exigent: GWB seems to be this way, apparently, in order to embrace a
privilege that allows him to ignore what is basically sweat: bodies, work,
energy expended in events, & the accounts of such life.   He ignores these
even though they are full, supple, bloody or wet, loud, *and in need.*
Continuously exigent working sweat. He must have very narrow and haired ears
and senses, generally, to ignore such mass sweat.

Train & ?illions: I'm haunted by the everday backyards I watched sigh past
my eyes on a train trip between Dallas and Chicago last year. Clotheslines:
diapers, dishrags, t-shirts, sundresses, bras, jeans, boxers.  One ton of
Socks, certainly.  Dead tires and doll parts in ditches.  Sheds, tricycles,
and ?illions of Marlborough packs.  Rusted fenders, automobile-hollows.

Damn & Good: In this dubious so-called land of the brave, we have leaders
who shy from recognizing and/or listening to signs or sighs of the good &
everyday.  What does that say?  I guess one thing is putting it this way
today indelibly marks me. Yes.

Talk & Not: It's not cold if people keep on.

Thanks, Stephen.

Chris Murray

        Thanks Alex. I suppose my insinuation was one of perspective. I didn't =
know what the legitimacy of this story was, nor whether the tenor in =
which it was ranted was accurate to the situation. It just got me =
thinking about the relational sand the line between cowardice and =
heroism is drawn upon. When we have a president who declares that the US =
"has the soverign authority to use force in assuring its own national =
security," does the assumption become that anyone who dies to further =
that cause is a de facto hero? Does the simple act of dying for a cause =
make a hero? Or are there certain acts more worth dying for? Certainly =
this is obvious in the extremes - a gunman who goes into a tacqueria to =
kill everyone in there and himself is despicable; a soldier who leaps on =
a grenade to keep it from obliterating his comrades is a hero. But =
there's an asymptote towards which both lines of action verge, where =
actions become blurred and unmoored from anything "universal." If we can =
grant that someone who sacrifices themselves during wartime is a hero, =
what do we make of the acts of Palestinians whose actions are similarly =
informed? I grant there's a difference between combatants in battle and =
innocent bystanders, but is that enough to base a sense of heroism on? =
Is there even ground to compare the person who abstains from war and he =
who gives his life for it? Are there degrees of morality at play and any =
code of arbitration by which we might judge each act's heroic =
authenticity?=20

        I myself am very suspect of the label "hero," which is very different =
than the actions that might precipitate being so conferred. To call =
someone or something heroic retrospectively is to moblize their actions =
- which are undertaken, if their life is given, in the utmost solitude - =
for some larger social purpose, for the the conscious or unconscious =
psychological coercion of those who were witness to the martyrdom. =
Similarly to call some or something evil is to do the same and I =
certainly don't trust a governing body to provide that distinction.   =20

Yesterday  Todd Colby and his wife were the victims of a devestating fire. In addition to their home, they suffered the loss of Todd's manuscripts and computer, his wife's paintings (she's an artist), one of their pets, and most of the rest of their possessions. Unfortunately, they are not insured.

Many of you may know Todd from his book Riot in the Charm Factory: New & Selected Poems, his work with St. Mark's Poetry Project, or any of the scores of readings his given in New York City and elsewhere, or from his days as the front man for the band Drunken Boat. He has just finished his next book, Tremble & Shine, which we'll be publishing in the spring. Anyway, Soft Skull Press is currently organizing a benefit for Todd and his wife at the Bowery Poetry Club--stay tunde for the date and details. In the meantime, I wanted to let you all know in case you know Todd or are in the position to offer some assistance or donation.

First and foremost, they are seeking a new apartment in Brooklyn, so all leads would be appreciated!

Thanks,
Shanna

Subject:      The "hermaphrodite" discussion
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I've been following the "hermaphrodite" discussion with interest, and at
times, admittedly, a bit of sadness, when the discussion becomes somewhat
fire-y--although that, too, can be interesting.

kari edwards has written a bit about usage of the word "hermaphrodite," both
here and on transdada (http://transdada.blogspot.com):

"when I see words like (hermaphrodite) being used and praised in writing as
a vehicle, I wonder if there is an awareness of the struggle the 'intersex'
individual in this society . . . or what the word means today to these
individuals . . . or is there just a general true lack of awareness of what
its like for anyone not fitting neatly into this policed state of gender
(myth)...... it seems the word (hermaphrodite) goes easily unexamined and
gets used in poetry as a romantic myth (it has throughout history, in the
dominate discourse mostly as a fetish, sometimes as a way to escape or
transcend or transition from one gender to another (sic)) and today is no
different, it is used without an awareness of contemporary struggle of these
individual and of the rigidity of gender there seems to be this general
assumption of gender... as a solid state..."

"Hermaphroditic" had, just before kari's post (to the list and to hir blog)
come up in Nada Gordon and Marianne Shaneen's Zinc Bar talk, which Nada
posted to her blog (http://ululate.blogspot.com). There, Marianne described
Nada's writing as "hermaphroditic," and Nada, picking up the cue, agreed,
explaining that she did not like false binaries, and that what is thought
(by some) as "male" aspects of writing are actually intricately linked with
what might be thought (by some) as "female" aspects of writing.

Nada goes on to talk about her "identity," as author of the poems, as being
male, female, hermaphroditic, gay, and straight. In her poems, it extends
further, blurring the lines between human and other animal life, animal and
plant life, and living matter and inanimate matter. The Whitmanic impulse
taken into the age of Neils Bohr et al. It isn't a recent "position" of
Nada's, nor would she say, herself, that it is not "romantic." Here's a
brief passage from something she wrote ("rodomontade") in 1985, some of
which she quotes in her talk:

"I am the infant terrible. ... As a courtesan, I teach men how to survive in
the wild. ... I am now a functionary ... My name is Percy Bysshe Shelley. I
am rather delicate and morbid, but full of inflamed passions. ... I am
western thought and I am going to scramble your messages."

Compare that "I am going to scramble your messages" with what Nada says in
her talk:

"No simple binaries--I rear up at these. Taxonomic nonsense--separating out
qualities for fear of identification with what might be deemed 'weak'...
Vulnerability and irony, sincerity and defiance, fragility and
formalism--not mutually exclusive--intertwined, interpenetrating. And
codependent. Hermaphroditism--with Aphrodite in the center--she helps me to
smudge the chalk at the boundaries of the 'two' worlds. Then what's
contained in either can spill in and over."

So, for Nada, the usage of "hermaphroditism" is part of a larger project to
"scramble" the very kinds of messages kari warns of: e.g., "policed state of
gender." They seem to be in solidarity on this (crucial?) point. The primary
difference, at least in this instance, between kari and Nada seems to be the
usage of the word "hermaphroditism," which is obviously mythological in
origin. More on myth in a bit.

Here is something by the late Berdache Jordan
(http://hermaphrodite.arriba.net/):

"Although I have attributes of both physical sexual extremes labeled 'male'
or 'female', I question, as do many others, that there are two sexes only. A
number has been expressed maintaining that there are five sexes. Perhaps
there are as many as 15% of all people in some degree in between 'male and
female' physically (intersexuals.) This is only physically, there are many
millions more who are psychologically, or spiritually born into the wrong
body. Even many more who are spiritually hermaphroditic whatever their
sexual preferences or gender orientation. Most people recognize we are both
spiritual and physical beings. Does one attribute prevail over the other if
they conflict?"

This openness that Berdache has when expressing the idea of people
"spiritually hermaphroditic whatever their sexual preferences or gender
orientation" strikes me as a very generous approach to identity. It's not
that different, actually, from Nada's sense of "poetic" identity as
described in her talk. "Spiritually hermpahroditic," in fact, sounds to me
romantic in worldview.

I gather, however, that Berdache is in the minority, as an intersexed
person, in that ze freely used the word "hermaphroditic," which is a word
some--many--intersexed people would like to see eliminated. Part of the
problem with the word, at least as I am trying to understand it, is that, as
it refers to humans, it is inaccurate, as no human is hermaphroditic in the
mythological sense--it's much more complex than that. More generally
biologically and botanically, it's a different matter--most flowers are
hermaphroditic, and some animals (many snails, for instance).

Nada has a poem, an older poem, that goes:

MY PENIS

is bright and triangular.
Physical fact and shape
a persistent drumbeat
adjectives cling up to:
moist, clever, leafy, spoiled --
anagrams of my real name
like flowers bigger than the world:
lineaments
of gratified desire

One could see this as a kind of poetic taking on of the identity of the
male, or maybe even someone intersexed, or hermaphroditic. I see it,
however, as more plant- or flower-like in terms of its "state of being"
(that "leafy", and especially that third-to-last line, "like flowers bigger
than the world"). (Snails, too, come up quite a bit in Nada's poetry, btw,
although not in the above.)

Nada isn't without awareness of the struggle of those transgendered--we do
know people who are transgendered, although that feels too much like saying
"some of my best friends are Jewish." But, kari is right, that we don't know
anyone personally who is intersexed--and it's a different "state of being"
than transgendered. The biologically intersexed, for instance, may or may
not identify with any larger "queer" community. Someone transgendered may
not, either--but the likelihood seems somewhat greater that they might.

This might help my own attempt at understanding why someone might reject
something mythological in origin. Whereas, for instance, Roman myth and icon
have been adopted and adapted as acceptable identifiers by many people over
the years (double Mars=gay; double or triple Venus=lesbian;
Mercury=transgendered), again, the intersexed may not relate much with the
gay, lesbian, and/or transgendered community(ies). Or, they may. It's not
either/or--while Berdache Jordan does not seem to have a problem with myth
or hermaphrodite specifically, others might.

Whose position on this do we take as the final arbiter? It will be
interesting to see what does happen w/respect to the word "hermaphrodite,"
especially (tho not solely) as it is used clinically w/respect to humans. My
own sense is that at some point it will change, at least as it's used to
clinically define someone with intersexed characteristics. But, that's just
speculation.

As someone who works professionally in the disability community, I know that
words, especially self-identifying words, are tricky, to say the least.

In kari's blog, she writes: "ask someone who is differently abled, what the
word 'disabled' means." kari may not realize this, but both "differently
abled" and "disabled" are, to many people with disabilities (and their
advocates) both equally wrong. I can't use either at my job. "Differently
abled" is considered, by many, as patronizing. "Disabled" is considered to
place the fact of existence prior to the person. In my job, we must use, in
all literature, "person with a disability." It can become intricate, and
sometimes you forget which phrase you're supposed to use. For instance,
while "disabled person" or "disabled people" are no-nos, "disability
community" is okay. The general rule (tho not always true) is that
"disabled" is usually wrong; "disability" is usually okay.

There are people where I work who will even change, or advocate to change,
language when it is being quoted from someone with a disability themself. If
a person with a disability writes "I am confined to a wheelchair," we
typically will have people in the office want to change that to "I use a
wheelchair." Anything that might hint at "negativity." Personally, I try to
advocate for people's own self-descriptions. Sometimes I win; sometimes
not--and to be honest, sometimes the decision that gets made feels
arbitrary, compromised.

Sometimes, admittedly, I feel similarly to what CA Conrad has described.
Especially when I remember my father, who has had muscular dystrophy for
thirty years, and who self-identifies not as "a person with a disability" or
"disabled" or even "differently abled" but as a "cripple" or "crip."

There are two disability rights magazines that go so far as to advocate
against widespread adoption of p.c. language w/respect to people with
disabilities: Mouth is one and Ragged Edge is another. The cover of one
Mouth issue I will always remember: The Ward Cleaver-looking guy grinning on
the cover with a speech bubble that reads: "I was only trying to HELP." The
people who work at and write for these magazines would have a field day with
kari's--or anyone else's--usage of "differently abled."

That is not to say that kari's usage is wrong, but that, like so much else,
context would be something to consider. If writing to Mouth magazine (or
even to the more conservative disability organization I work for), one might
want to avoid "differently abled," even if one has friends with disabilities
who prefer that particular identifier. Just as I would never use "crippled"
(or "crip") at work, even though my father (and the people at other
"disability-related" organizations, such as Mouth) seem to prefer it.

But ... in a poem? Contexts other than audience would probably further
complicate word-choice decisions, although audience of course is never--or
anyway rarely--absent.

Understanding may be, as George Steiner seemed to imply in After Babel,
translation. So that we never fully understand; our "understanding" (of
others' experiences, etc.) is, like translation, flawed, skewed (by our own
experience). It doesn't mean we shouldn't try hard to be "good translators."
But rather to try, as well, to have the fullest "understanding" of what
"understanding" itself is ... if that's not too vague.

Gary

the following is an announcement for an upcoming reading at
La Tazza series in Philadelphia, curated by Frank Sherlock.

Frank has a unique series where he invites a different guest
host to invite and introduce poets of their choice every other reading.

-------------

November 29

1799- American utopianist Amos Bronson Alcott born, London, England
1947- German Green Party leader Petra Kelly born, Gunzburg, Bavaria
1969- Australian labor radical, bohemian artist Norman Lindsay dies, Sydney

November 29, 2003

Kyle Conner presents:
Corina Copp & Joseph Massey
a benefit reading for MoveOn.org
La Tazza 108
108 Chestnut St. Philly
7pm cocktail hour
readings at 8 sharp

Corina Copp lives in Brooklyn, and is the author of Sometimes Inspired by
Marguerite, a chapbook just out from Open 24 Hours, and plays "Cordelia,"
"The FACCOR Sessions," and "The Night Room." Her work can be found or is
forthcoming in canwehaveourballback?, Pom2, Pindeldyboz, and Fence. She's
happily co-existing at the Poetry Project in NYC, where she officially
Program Assists.

Joseph Massey lives in Eureka, CA. where he is the editor of Range
Magazine/Press. He is the author of Minima St. His latest poems have

Upcoming Readings:
Dec.13- Gary Sullivan & Sofia Memon
Jan.24- CA Conrad presents Brenda Coultas & Charlie O'Hay
Feb.7- kari edwards & Ron Silliman

Reading Report:

Jim Behrle did what he called his "Miles Champion impression, a speed-read
of burning poems. It was his notebook reading- consisting of Purple Notebook
of the Lake and No Notebooks, in which the poems are negatively numbered. He
was the Larry Bird of poetry, only not hated like Philly hates the Celtics.

Alicia Akenase called out Ashington DC in her guts-out satirathon, blurring
the fact & fictional. The factual (of course) was much scarier. She dreamed
of cruising with Charles Bernstein & Paul Auster & was loved by all.

Jim had to Fung Wah to NY to feed Lisa Jarnot's cat, but Alicia stayed to
dish about her old job at the Whitman Center. Conrad drank six Redheaded
Sluts, & then came the crush lists. I can't say who said what, but Greg
Fuchs made more than one "Poets I want to Sleep With" list. CA got so worked
up he left for a 2AM date.

Announcements:

Remember, this reading's a benefit for MoveOn.org, so save your lunch money
this week & give next Saturday!

But where do the drains in the streets
go, that carry so much as rains seize
our hands; as if elements
in fear are unattractive, and she knows
the people who live there. Flesh from
roadkill dissolves into them, washed

we walk holding everyone's hands under
a shit-for-sky, putrid underbelly
of her familiarity with them, their sick
kid she knows enough about, listing
his toys in the order of frequency

of use. I guess people leave all the
time, and it too must be down there somewhere.

I'm wondering whether "androgyne" or "gynander" manages to convey a
bi-sexed identity without the implicit slur on intersexed people.

heard about violence toward transgender people that it didn't exist.  I don't
think I have ever met a transgender person in this town.  I think there were
some in Seattle.  I couldn't honestly imagine anybody wanting to kill these
people.  I thought this was another myth of the pc left, like the beatings on
Superbowl day.  It didn't make any sense to me, so I thought maybe this is
just the usual kill rate in urban areas (we haven't had a murder in this town
for at least fifty years).

So then I started to do research.  First, I wanted to know what a transgender
person is.  And I found that there are only forty absolutely pure cases of a
person whose gender is evenly split.  But one person in a thousand has some
evidence of both sexes.  That's 300,000 people!  I had no idea.

Then, I opened up this page -- I hope I don't screw it up --

http://www.angelfire.com/on/otherwise/epidemic.html

And this page says that it's often law enforcement officials beating these
people up, who are often vagrants because nobody will hire them.  It also
said they are getting killed at three times the rate of African-American men.

At first I wondered if this was a problem inside the community.  Because I
looked up lesbian battering, and it turns out they have a higher rate than
heterosexuals -- and the violence is often much worse because the
victim/victimizer sizes are often more equal, so the bludgeoning goes on
longer.

Two books on this that I got out of the library -- Kerry Lobel, Naming the
Violence: Speaking out About Lesbian Battering

and

Claire Renzetti -- Violent Betrayal -- Partner Abuse in Lesbian Relationships
--

So I felt that maybe the transgender people were killing each other.  But it
doesn't at least appear to be so.  They are actually getting killed by
strangers.  This actually terrifies me.  Why are people doing this?

It doesn't make any sense to me.  These people seem to be completely harmless
(I've only met one -- but he or she?  what pronoun are you supposed to use,
if the person changed from a man into a woman? -- but I think she defined
herself as a woman, so maybe that's right?)

I posted something earlier on this and didn't take it seriously.  I'm sorry
about that -- and thanks to Kari for making me aware of this terrifying
situation.

I think there should be safe houses for these people -- forget about poetry
for right now -- there has to be something concrete done to make these people
safe.  Are there shelters?  I cannot make out why anybody would go to the
weird length to commit murder.  I thought murder was only within families, or
at least closely related people, and for other clear motives such as getting
money when you're broke.  I can't even imagine the motive.

I don't think that by "transgender" we've been referring here to the
anatomically trans-gendered.

Are you also unaware of violence against gays in general?

As to lesbian partners beating each other up, I'd make the uneducated guess
that the elevated numbers when compared to heterosexual mates probably has
a lot to do with the under-reporting of the latter, often with police
encouragement.

What other groups of people do you think should be segregated from the rest
of society for their own protection?

Thank you Gary, for your sensitive discussion. Thank you to everyone who
takes the question seriously, especially those who have made themselves
vulnerable. To the knife wavers, no thank you.

I have been back-channeled by a couple list members with insinuating
messages like "What is up with these sensitive people? I thought this list
was supposed to be about poetry." I told these people to buzz off. I would
further say, as kindly as possible, that if you don't take seriously the
questions kari raises and their implications for poetry, then your real
thinking may not have happened yet.

My use of the glitteringly ugly expression "lusus naturae" needs a
book-length explanation. It may just happen that I get to write this book,
and that you all get to read it! Until then, my friends will take it on
good faith that my usage is redemptive, not abusive, and I'm not talking
fake shit. Friends, my shit is deadly real.

For Kasey Mohammad, the friendliest friend, I was moved to speak out by
affection.
For David Hadbawnik, who is always sweet where I am sour, I feel a most
tender affection.
For kari edwards my message is private, but not my love & affection.
For the rest of you: Doubt my affection and you're doubting the sunshine LRSN

Mark, you should read the books I listed.  They were both written by lesbians.  In
fact, there is probably underreporting, as you say, but both authors stressed that
this was a huge problem in the lesbian community but that shelters would not be
set aside (community resources) unless the problem was outed.

I was jumped twice in Seattle while walking with male friends at night.  I'm aware
of the problem.

I never stated that anyone should be segregated, but I also don't think that
people should have to be vagrants because nobody will hire them.  Please read the
link I posted to get more context.  It's very short.

Well, golly, -- I've been deleting this "operation" thread thinking it was about
that game where you lift organs off the board with a pair of tweezers!

I see the value in the discussion that's materialized over Kasey's blurb.
Kevin's intial comments were obviously well intentioned and informative.
Kari's last post was precisely the kind of well-informed response that I'm
quite sure Kasey appreciates.

On the other hand, it seems positively absurd for anyone, kari included, to
boycott a reading (whether one calls it a boycott or not) based on this blurb.
There is the obvious point that Rodney didn't write the blurb.  And the even
more obvious poiint that in boycotting Rodney one is needlessly, senselessly
boycotting Mytili Jagannathan, one of our great young writers, a progressive
writer, and, for what it's worth, a gay writer who is herself tirelessly
attentive to questions of gender.  This, to me, smacks of the
kind of meticulous squabble that so often derails valuable liberal projects.
"Hey, Kasey, you exoticized 'sex-change' in a somewhat insenstive, ahistorical
way in your blurb."  Wouldn't this have sufficed?

And, one last thing.  Has the sentence in Kasey's blurb been read a bit
reductively by its critics?  I mean, it is a rather complex sentence:

"Cannily an(a)esthet(ic)izing the misogynist and orientalist phantasms that are
projected on the digital plateaux of its own prosodic bravado, this is how
Naked Lunch might have turned out if it had been written by Robert Browning
having a sex-change operation."

To take the logic of the sentence at its word, *if* Browning were having a
sex-change operation, would he not be subject to all the violent, nefarious
historical forces kari mentioned in her last post - the attempt by the medical
community to rigidly enforce gender butting up against the mind's tendency to
think of gender as a fluid category, for instance?  And, being Browning, a
fucking great poet, would he not, at least symbolically, resist such rigidity
in the form of the poem?  And if "Naked Lunch" happened to be the thing he was
writing, might it not look like Rodney's poetry?  And if it it did, then why,
for Pete's sake, would this be the least bit misogynist?? Because its subject
is misogyny???  Likewise with the claim that there HAS to be insensitivity
regarding sex-change operations here. It seems to me that one can make just as
good a case that its precisely the opposite.  At the very least, being a rather
poetic sentence on the back of a poetry book, it demands to be read poetically
rather than for the red flag spiked to its surface.

I don't begrudge kari her personal stand here, which she seems dead set on.  But
I do feel compelled to say that it would be a terrible mistake and a damn shame
for anyone else to miss Mytili's and Rodney's reading over this.

Here is a passage from the Turkish poet Ece Ayhan's "Orthodoxies" (published
by Sun and Moon Press):

"... He has writings etched over his breast in saffron repeating,
embroidering one word from the lexicon endlessly: hermaphrodite. A hermetic woman. A man
and a woman. She makes love biting his own lip... "

The poem in whole and many other wonderful poems will be in the upcoming
"Eda: An Anthology of Contemporary Turkish Poetry." Keep an eye on.

The arguments around "hermaphrodite" seem to center around the permission to
use a word in a poem. I thought the point of a poem is to use unpermitted
words, unpermitted language.

I agree with Nada's view that in poetry at least language moves towards a
state where distinctions -consequently permissions- disappear -towards a state of
dissolution.

There's absolutely no connection between saying one would like to bat burglars in the head (especially after robbery #3!) to these horrific incidents of bigoted violence!

It's ridiculous to even suggest a superficial similarity. They play baseball with bats too, ya know. Bats use sonar to navigate in the dark. I'm batting my eyelashes right now.

Please.

Hi everyone,
I've just noticed this debate is on the list, I'm not surprised, but am not a
regular reader of the list these days.
To identify, as kari suggests we do, I am the person who in one role might be
referenced to as "SPT".
kari wrote me just after I posted the listing for tomorrow night's reading. I
responded in a private email to hir.
I just want to say a couple of things publicly.
I am glad kari pointed out to me her discomfort with my use of this blurb for
publicity.
I would like to be as respectful & sensitive as I can to all fellow beings.
I'm not always; I don't think any one on this list is.
In my role at SPT I see myself as facilitating a forum for all kinds of free
expression and experiments with language. By free expression I do not mean to
indicate that what was termed in my undergraduate years as "hate speech" is
acceptable. However, I do not think Kasey's blurb fits that description.
However, I do see kari's point. In fact, it has caused me quite a bit of
thought and emotion over the last few days. However again, there have been
words said & themes used at SPT events that I have found offensive for various
reasons stemming from my own personal experience with the hardships of gender
and violence. & in these cases, I haven't tried to censor anyone. & in these
instances I've mostly been offended by a lack of complexity and a lack of
empathy.
I'll also identify myself as a female person with a new female person to
raise, which makes me too tired to read this list and which makes me want a
world in which she can be free, safe, and happy.
I hope that my writing and my work in the world go towards the greater good.
(I realize "greater good" is lazy language.)
There is no simple way to do this, and no simple way to be truthful in
language.
I know both Kasey and kari to be good kind people, from what I know of them.
I don't know what else to say, really.
Best regards,
Elizabeth

hey this is great; this is beginning to sound like my other list, a
buddhist list that comments on political stuff. everyone is SOOO nice
on it, sometimes it's too much, but on poetix i think this is just
the right amount of niceness. thanks everyone for being so nice to
each other and so thoughtful at the same time --thoughtful as in
"full of ideas thoughts etc" not just "considerate of others."

As I recall, the "revenge fantasy" of Kasey's lime
tree comment reproduced below was directed at a
person(s) who burglarized his home.  Their sexuality
is of no consequence.  To link his feelings of anger
at being violated with latent (or not so latent)
homophobia by juxtaposing his comment with clips which
involve baseball bats and violent homophobic crimes
seems both disingenuous and in poor taste.

This is a most wonderful batty response - outsiders will suspect your eye
lashes are so heavy and long that they have to be verbally instructed,
"batter up" or "batter down," or, before sleep, "batter out." Don't feel
self-conscious, as I, too, am a little bats myself, some say, as in a golden
bowl when eggs and milk are added to be whipped into a lovely and stirring
batter.

Neither of these words work for me.  It's primarily because of their sound
rather than because they offend.  The second term has a forced feel to it.

         Just a quick note to all who may be interested. I have an
illustrated article in the current (Fall 2003, Vol. 36, #5) issue of
Leonardo, the Journal of the International Society for the Arts,
Sciences
and Technology. It is called "The Crying Post Project: A Multi-Part,
Multi-Media Artwork to Memorialize Global Sites of Pain."

         Quoting the abstract: "The author described The Crying Post
Project, an artwork consisting primarily of wood staffs with
solar-powered
"cry generators" place at different sites throughout the globe, at
locations of environmental and/or social damage. Its two other
components
include an interactive 3D web site, which has been created as an
alternative, data-rich venue for the project, and a series of digitally
created photographic prints designed to capture the artist's emotional
response to the sites. The artist also discusses how this artwork has
been
inspired by his research on the cross-cultural symbolism of trees, the
indigenous Australian worldview, mapping theory and the relationship
between language extinction and environmental destruction."

         In the introduction to this special section called Global
Crossings, Mark Beam, co-guest editor writes, "We must be concerned with

the untenable disparity in wealth across the globe and our flawed
accounting for natural and human resources. We must be concerned with
the
structure of power and the rising importance of grassroots social
networking tools.
         In this context, artists are busy surveying and mapping the
scene,
providing alternative interpretations of our relative position in space.

Less distracted than most, perhaps, by our oligarchic mass-media
structure,
these artists have a critical role in elucidating the awesome tragedy
and
potential afforded by a new frontier. Dennis Summers's Crying Post
Project
is a prime example of this fragile position."

         Additionally, there are several articles about the Burning Man
Festival in this issue. So I imagine it will be a hot seller -reserve
your
copy now.

Some Mistakes

written under illness with codeine surrounded by the fleshy protuberances

Someone makes mistakes with Spiders and Scorpions and the Scorpions eat

Someone starts a big forest-fire and Fireweed or Willow-Herb grows up to
"glorify each blackened waste" and this leads to much replanting.

Some places the Rameses II pet horned toad for dinner of David the cricket
who is eaten by Rameses II. "when he was only a baby cricket with musical
possibilities."

Someone places the collared lizard just next to everything and everything
was all eaten us.

Someone starts mistakes and finishes them with other writings from the
Fairyland text which I have cited in a previous work complete with
attribution. This is a description of some of the mistakes although the
fire is not a mistake and this is a talisman so there will be no more
mistakes. Now there will be no more mistakes.

Not that this should necessarily be brought back around to poetry, but the
excellent discussion that has been going on here makes me wonder about the
relationship between poetry and violence. War poetry of course being an
obvious reference point, but I'm particularly interested to know also in
what ways urban/domestic/symbolic etc. violence has been engaged with in
recent work. Who else is doing work that deals with violence?

Ohhh -----but that is a good and complicated question. One must of course
think about the relationship between  violence and language then.  Not just
a SUBJECT matter that equals violence. (i.e. you hit me) But the violence o=
f
trying to represent  (some/selfs) oneself as a subject in language at all.
         So in a way I guess all these posts have to do with that-- how doe=
s
one silence, who is silenced, how is that silencing violent?  How does one
speak, who speaks, how is that speaking violent? Sticks and stones break
bones, but names, on the contrary to the rhyme, lay the ground for it.
Having read a deal of kari edward's work for some time now, I would say tha=
t
a great deal of it IS about the violence of language and the violent acts
that follow/precede/follow those acts of language.
               Monique Wittig in "The Lesbian Body" approaches the
representation of the "feminine" subject in written language by writing the
subject "je" as "j/e"=8Bsplitting the nominative singular pronoun with a
slash.  This illustrates a self that is always divided, that cannot become =
a
unified subject in patriarchal language. The violence of that split pronoun
is echoed in the viscerality of Wittig=B9s text, where the body described is
also continually divided.  In English translation this concept cannot be
fully captured, but the "I" is put into Italics=8Bthus becoming "I".  In
French, the feminine pronoun in group (one might think of it as a social
context) will always be absorbed by the masculine, as well.  Wittig states:

"I" (je) obliterates the fact that elle or elles are submerged in il or
ils, I.e. that all the feminine persons are complementary to the masculine
persons...The "I" (je) who writes is alien to her own writing at every word
because this "I" (je) uses a language alien to her; this "I" (je) cannot be
un =E9crivain=8A=20



       Theresa Cha's "Dictee" in part deals with the speaker=B9s attempt to
become a speaker of a new (or perhaps any) tongue.  As in the following:

She mimicks the speaking.  That might resemble speech. (Anything at all.)
Bared noise, groan, bits torn from words.  Since she hesitates to measure
the accuracy, she resorts to mimicking gestures with the mouth.  The entire
lower lip would lift upwards then sink back into its original place.   She
would then gather both lips and protrude them in a pout taking in the breat=
h
that might utter some thing.  (One thing.  Just one.)  But the breath falls
away.  With a slight tilting of her head backwards, she would gather the
strength in her shoulders and remain in this position.

It murmurs inside.  It murmurs.  Inside is the pain of speech the pain to
say.  Larger still.  Greater than is the pain not to say.  To not say.  Say=
s
nothing against the pain to speak.  It festers inside.  The wound, liquid,
dust.  Must break.  Must void.

The speaker struggles with the very physical act of speech.  The process of
mouthing words serves to torment both the one who would speak and the
language itself.  Speaking mutilates words ("bits torn from words") and
causes one=B9s lips to contort.  It takes one=B9s breath away.  The act of
speaking might here also serve as a metaphor for writing.  The
Korean-American author struggles to find a vehicle for expression in a
language that is not her own.  The words given seem to disintegrate.  They
suffocate her by taking her breath.  At the same time, not using them prove=
s
more painful.  She balances with imperfect tools between the pain of
expression and the pain of silence.


Okay,  now this bit of the dicussion "hits" on something I am interested in=
.
Can we not all think about language as a structure that is rarely (ever?)
neutral. We can defend our rights to free speech (and I do) but is not that
a freedom that we need to be very very careful with, very very educated
about? It is not about censorship for me, it IS about awareness... it seems
to me we've been throwing around comments with transgender language in a
more casual (violent?) way than we ever would at this point in our
"liberated, educated" lives about other human "categories" (race, class?,
binary gender, orientation)

Okay, it is late and I am tired of grading papers-- so that was my daily
dose--

Julie:

Yes, what a great response, and thank you for foregrounding the issue of the
"violence of language," which was foremost in my mind and which reminds of
course of the great book by Jean-Jacques Lecercle.

At the same time, I wouldn't want to see the "violence of language" subsume
physical violence, which has an experiential element that is difficult to
deny (not that the violence of language cannot also be a physical thing as
in the example you made of Theresa Cha's work).

Is writing that performs a kind of linguistic violence an adequate analogue
or expression of the violence that is in the world? If "one" believes that
all violence comes home to roost in language then fine, but how then does
one account for physical violence?

Documentary language can be effective. Kari's posting of the list of
transgendered people who have been murdered was a devastating thing to read.
Reznikoff's documentary poems bring violence into language through quite
normative means, description, bits of narrative, etc. but the effect is
anything but banal. I've always been suspicious of the various denigrations
of narrative that crop up in experimental/avant-garde circles, as if
narrative was monolithic.

Thanks again for your very interesting post.

Scott

As publisher of aformentioned & discussed volume
Rodney Koeneke's Rouge State
($12 postage paid, direct from Pavement Saw Press)
the defense is, where it should be, within the poems:


------------------

#1

Impurity’s the watch-word here;  you get that the minute
you step off the boat.  A few hours paddling the lake that forms
the liquid circumference of the conference center
and it’s high time to skim from the Captain’s indiscretions
more saucy affairs of your own.

While the steamer offers comfort
it poses other, deeper problems:  the boiler room
and its touchy valves, the co-pilot sounding the shallows
with his game day leg, the cook of a menacing
and indeterminate mien, whose idea of luxury starts and ends
with gazpacho every night.

But somewhere the jungle offers recompense.
You watch the tendrils pleat a slinky grammar
over the dumber parts of the river
and wonder if they’d bear a human weight—
a swing from those limbs would be delectable,
almost sexual, like the pink and white flora that cruise downstream
with their flushed, brazen orifices unflexed for all the world
to sniff and see.  Night smells, the insipid chatter
of baboons, evoke nacreous visions of openings
beyond the frontier:  a lush, unspoiled loveliness
around the next muddy crook of the next river over
of a kind no pilgrim your size has ever seen.

And this, too, carries its freight of pleasures
which is also the obverse of a certain boredom:
the rush of not knowing what to praise
meets the roar of the urgent press to mean
not in any straightforward, symbolic way
but just in a general tam-tam of the drums
that bang at night in time to your iffy breath
and unmanning requests to the headman
for an escort past the falls.

A bevy of insects or something to keep loud with,
water and syntax, an enormous ebon slave
is what you might need to make it out here—
a tribe of scribes to ink your winsome hymns.


-----------------------

& this poem (#9), besides the entire contents of the book, is the one
closest to being specifically addressed by Kasey's blurb:

-----------------------


#9

Mammogram the bildungsroman, induce
dingbat hexameters in the heldentenor’s
yeasty Hornitos.  Queen Ixnay to the E-bay
goes Braxton-Hicks on mother’s bad milk day.
Computer’s at last completely stewy—
picked up a bug at the honor bar.  Citizen Quiggley
from the Gun and Doll Commission seeks flap
with pointillistic gabardine.  Bad weekends for
two straight quarters—look inward and talk
to the polygraph:  Have you grokked
Hampton Hawes today?

Hey, they were fisting my peoples
on the Road to Hematosis.  In what woods were you,
Goody Hooper?  We were mewling lords of power
in the Gallery of World Sculpture,
waving from the piazza
with the rabbi’s seltzer bottle.  Come, Selma
and scotchguard the rainbow
to the john of the Sunset Room.  Give us an ‘E’
for unpleasant Effordent.  To cry ‘uncle’
in a wartime theater, that

Was all our pleasure:  to swap knuckles
with a gorgeous case of tartar.  Yes,
we were all feeling Amish.  Denver, please bring me
my omelet pan and we’ll bang at the congressman’s gams.
I have seen the gated community, and it looks
a lot like us.  Hiss fireworks, steam
the Atlantic—green sleestack, be all that.



---------------



The blurb itself I read in the same manner that Mike Magee brought forth
in an earlier posting. The comparison is apt in and of itself, I do not
agree that "sex-change operation" is used to express "freakiness" but
rather that were Burroughs & Browning transported to the current
culture, made more aware of their locked locations in terms of sexual
identity roles, poems like this might have been written.

Poetry bears with its responsibilities, the changing of language from
one value to another, the shifting of meaning to another created form. I
am specifically thinking of Ed Sanders attempt as a publisher of FUCK
YOU: A Journal of the Arts, to change the sexual values and properties
of words. It is apparent that these types of value changes will bother
some people, but it is also obvious that words and phrases such as
"hermaphrodite" or "sex-change operation" do not ever appear in blurbs
used by publishers who are intentionally avoiding the possibility of
problems with political correctness. In our moments of expanding the
confines of literature, I hope that it is our willingness to do so that
is pointed towards, not our lack of following gentrified publishing
standards adhered to by academic, corporate, and other "large
small-press" publishers.


Be well

-----------------------------------------
Dear friends,

Wednesday, November 18 Todd Colby and his wife were the victims of a
devestating fire in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. In addition to their home, they
suffered the loss of Todd's manuscripts and computer, his wife's paintings
(she's an artist), one of their pets, and most of the rest of their
possessions. Unfortunately, they are not insured.

Here is the NY Times article about the fire:
http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/20/nyregion/20FIRE.html

Many of you may know Todd from his book Riot in the Charm Factory: New &
Selected Poems, his work with St. Mark's Poetry Project, or any of the
scores of readings his given in New York City and elsewhere, or from his
days as the front man for the band Drunken Boat. He has just finished his
next book, Tremble & Shine, which we'll be publishing in the spring.

Soft Skull Press is currently organizing a benefit for Todd and his wife at
the Bowery Poetry Club on Sunday, December 14 at 8:00 p.m.

First and foremost, they are seeking a new apartment in Brooklyn, so all
leads would be appreciated!

To respond to Scott's question about other work that deals with =
violence, one of the issues I was exploring for Into Stillness, which =
Station Hill Press published in July, looked at the impact of state =
sponsored brutality. I read survivor narratives from Bosnians, Mayans, =
Salvadoreans, and others. How did they cope once they found a safe =
haven? How did the torture they lived through show up later? Many, =
including my g'parents, embraced silence. But signs emerged, in =
relationships, work, simple events like drinking a cup of coffee. My =
writing was a meditation on the body, with glimpses, dissociations, and =
disruptions appearing in language.

  Not that this should necessarily be brought back around to poetry, but =
the
  excellent discussion that has been going on here makes me wonder about =
the
  relationship between poetry and violence. War poetry of course being =
an
  obvious reference point, but I'm particularly interested to know also =
in
  what ways urban/domestic/symbolic etc. violence has been engaged with =
in
  recent work. Who else is doing work that deals with violence?

Hi Julie,

Thanks for that wonderful post. Wittig was great.

I hope that when you say that "we" have been "throwing around" transgendered
language, that anything in my own post was not an example, but I also know
that I am far from perfect or enlightened. Anyway, please let me know.

This discussion, here on the list, has been mostly interesting, and mostly
respectful. I wish I could say the same for some of the backchannel I've
received. Someone yesterday forwarded me comments from an anonymous third
person that felt, to be honest, not only violent, but calculatedly so, and
certainly not in the spirit of openness. I'm assuming that the person who
made the following comments might be reading--if not an active participant
on--this list. Here are some of those comments:

"so the lived experience of intersex, trans, queer people is relegated to an
imaginary, temporal land of never-never-mind the reality of people's lives,
because its my writer's right to mythologize and play with any 'body' that
appeals to my sense of make-believe. but she wanna be a gender activist or
ally or some shit. anyway, i think nada's arrogance was ridiculous and
redundant ... she knows nothing about what she's talking ... her shit is
just about the glamorization of her own ego."

I just want to say here that the anonymous person who said the above, and
who okayed its being forwarded to me, could learn a very valuable lesson
from you, Julie, your very open, and genuinely thoughtful way of expressing
your beliefs. The person above may well have had good intentions (although
the violence of the language suggests otherwise) and good points to make
(although, again, the violence of the language makes it difficult to read
them here with any empathy), and it is just sad to me that the main idea
that will come across in the above, is its very violence--although
intellectually I am sympathetic with life experiences that might have given
rise to that violent manifestation of expression.

The ideal response to a world in which violence is an unfortunate,
ever-presence, is to cease the cycle of violence. Thank you, Julie, for your
sincere attempts to do so. I really, really hope not to receive more mail
like the above in the future, but do welcome--here or backchannel--anyone's
genuine desire to dialog.

Gary

Dear David...

I do not think I ("the plural we / me") or someone or anyone was=20
stating an objection to the use of the *word(s)*.. (that is to close to=20=

  book burning)... right?.. or that it situates anyone in or to a=20
position of "freakiness"....

I do not think that was the point... as you stated:::::-

"The comparison is apt in and of itself, I do not
agree that "sex-change operation" is used to express "freakiness" but
rather that were Burroughs & Browning transported to the current
culture, made more aware of their locked locations in terms of sexual
identity roles..."


that is just the point.. "sex-change operation" (sic) is a social=20
construct of / for limiting fluidity- . . . . right? . . .. . it was a=20=

manifestation of the gender clinics in Germany, pre-Nazi.. and=20
resurfaced in Denmark, Sweden, and Monaco, and then.. spread =20
throughout the globe including Japan, China... in most recent years...=20=

the  idea behind it has always been one of making a perfectly=20
expectable women (sic) or a man (sic)).. and fluidity was not a part of=20=

that and definitely not unlocking sexual roles.. this was and has=20
always been a heterosexual construct....... it was to secure "them" to=20=

the proper gender with proper parts...... in the 1950-90's (even today)=20=

the list of reasons for not allowing someone to receive "sex=20
reassignment surgery" is; being to tall, wearing blue jeans, wrong job,=20=

for males-to-female being lesbian... for females to males if they=20
identified as gay males... and the list goes on.. really this is the=20
premies which Mary Daly & Janice Raymond wrote about in their=20
insinuatory books on the subject (which for the most part I agree=20
with.. but they lack the world view of fluid gender history and are=20
still stuck in essentialist freudian perspective)..

it was not until the massive resistance from the essentialist movement=20=

and the rejection of so many  Seeking *surgery* from clinics and those=20=

who choose not to have surgery did true shifting idenities come into=20
being... for example who said a guy can't have a clit and my sweetie=20
girlfriend a dick... (and I only scratch the surface here ...).. but=20
this is only the beginning... a guy with breast and a dick.. who=20
dresses a la fem... and is straight... no surgery.... and ststisticly=20
(excluding the breast) there are far more individuals like this..=20
almost 100 to 5... thousands and thousands of those who cross dress

my point is it is a cultural myth and projected stereo type of=20
misinformation the "sex change operation" (sic) has nothing to do, or=20
little with making one aware of the "locked locations in terms of=20
sexual identity roles."... besides... gender and sexual role have=20
nothing to do with the other... one is who you fuck (which can have any=20=

form) and gender (is how you identify (when you fuck).... so, SRS, or=20
"sex-change surgery" (sic) is an social construct of normalization-..=20
one based on the court (in some cases you can not change record until=20
surgery... which is classist.. since most can not afford it....)

kari
ps

since this a poetics list and I take some of the responsibility for not=20=

including language at least.....and to reference it back to Julie's=20
offering... a lot of the violence is language based...

1. for those that identifying as one gender and have another applied=20
based on cultural markers is violence... so pronouns in general are=20
violent.. beside gender specific pronouns only offer a two options.. is=20=

that not essentialism and control or what?

2. we still suffer from a phallocentric language hangover.. when in=20
conversations or others... it is always fireMeN...congressMen...=20
postMeN.. how about post human......

until parts are snap-ons, no  markers  per-say on governmental ID's..=20
until we get rid of grammar.. until we walk down the street and do not=20=

just see two genders... untill ...
  we are all makes by the violence of gender

I'm writing to recommend
Andrew Joron's new book

FATHOM
Black Square Editions
ISBN 0-9744065-1-1 $12.95
available through SPD Small Press Distribution

It's a book of great range and density, beginning with
"The Emergency" and ending with"Fantastic Prayers."
Catastrophes register in tiny orthographic shifts:

How the fallen state
Meets the starry horizon, veil
   against witness, hunger against void.

O, oldest
   outermost Other -

Ageing mask
Of the transparent Earth. Unspeculated
   image
Streaked with mirror & stricken words.

You are neither the torn, nor the thorn.

You are the many-petalled
   melting point of repeating decimals...

("Spine to Spin, Spoke to Speak," p. 64)

Like all Black Square books,
it's beautifully designed as well.
Best Wishes,
Devin

Kirby:

To a poet, it is impossible to "forget about poetry for right now." Even in
Death Camps, especially in Death Camps, poetry was written, recited, and
discussed. It doesn't take from an issue but magnifies it into a larger
perspective. Without poetry, without art, there is no safe place for anyone.

Who "knife-waving"? Talk about insensitive uses of language (where did
violence enter in, for ex.)... I only said the blurb made me feel "a little
icky." I don't find it to be "offensive," nor was I trying to censor anyone
by offering my response. I was just offering my response, so you hear it.
So there's an awareness. A critical awareness of how one uses certain
terms. But I'm not trying to shut anybody up or censor anyone. How did we
get from "this use of the word offends me" to "I'm censoring you and you
can't use that word"? This is a big leap that I don't recall anyone making
anywhere along the line. Just because someone responds negatively doesn't
mean they've suddenly turned into "the language police."

I think it must be possible for people not-of-identity-x to write about
identity x, or else none of us would have anything to write about! I am
less concerned with the issue of "appropriation" because I don't see how
this problem can be completely avoided if one is writing about things and
people outside, beyond, or exterior to the self. I think the best a writer
can do is make sensitive choices with, if they use such words, at least
contextualize their usage in a critical way.

I've been involved in the tg community and tg activism for about three
years now, and these issues are a big part of my writing, and as I read all
these posts I can just feel the writer's block closing in...are we talking
about the word "hermaphrodite," in which case one is referring mostly to an
ideal (there being even non-western hermaphroditic god/desses)? Or is the
issue this wording "sex-change operation"? Real people decide to have
sex-change operations and they often go through a difficult struggle with
that transition, as well as all the abuses and obstacles already mentioned.
I don't think it's too much to ask that someone be sensitive to and
critical about the fact that this is someone else's experience and not
theirs. But do I think we should never discuss gender in a poem, or that we
should not use words like "hermaphrodite"? Of course not...

I think another weirdness going on here is that critical theorists have
latched onto various issues of gender and the transgendered as something
"trendy," like the critical theory myth-of-the-week, and we are
experiencing an unhappy confusion between transgenderism as a nexus of
critical theory (via Garber, Butler, and others) and transgenderism as a
real phenomenon that real people experience. While there is a dialectic
between these two terms, I think it's important to make a distinction
between these different aspects of the discussion. Claiming they were
one-and-the-same thing would be like me trying to literalize Freud by
looking at the imagery in a friend's poem in order to determine how he
really felt about his mother. That's too quick and too literal a leap...I
think there are some often ambivalent steps in between.

Subject: Re: The "hermaphrodite" discussion

Thank you Gary, for your sensitive discussion. Thank you to everyone who
takes the question seriously, especially those who have made themselves
vulnerable. To the knife wavers, no thank you.

I have been back-channeled by a couple list members with insinuating
messages like "What is up with these sensitive people? I thought this list
was supposed to be about poetry." I told these people to buzz off. I would
further say, as kindly as possible, that if you don't take seriously the
questions kari raises and their implications for poetry, then your real
thinking may not have happened yet.

My use of the glitteringly ugly expression "lusus naturae" needs a
book-length explanation. It may just happen that I get to write this book,
and that you all get to read it! Until then, my friends will take it on
good faith that my usage is redemptive, not abusive, and I'm not talking
fake shit. Friends, my shit is deadly real.

For Kasey Mohammad, the friendliest friend, I was moved to speak out by
affection.
For David Hadbawnik, who is always sweet where I am sour, I feel a most
tender affection.
For kari edwards my message is private, but not my love & affection.
For the rest of you: Doubt my affection and you're doubting the sunshine LRSN

Tim has mistaken my message of 11/20 as a response to his post of 11/19.
No, I was talking about the guy who on 11/18 threatened to "slash" Kasey
and me in "one swipe," and was the first to introduce the threat of
violence to this discussion. It's OK though --if his knife-fighting is
anything like his writing, I've never felt safer LRSN

Thanks, Julie K, for this post. The French split "j/e" (curiously we say
"slashed" in English- an interesting verb in terms of part of this
discussion's focus on violence directed at thos who mix up, or redefine
their own sense gender boundaries.
I am wondering/asking if anyone writes "m/e" as an indicator of a more
complicated interior mix of one's inhabitants.
In the early seventies I edited and published a magazine called "Shocks" - =
a
name indicative of the experience of the eruptions of the period (ethnic,
sexual, political, regional and global). This discussion brings back a 1974
Shocks that was entitled, "The Androgyny Issue: Men Looking at Women in
Themselves, Women Looking at Men in Themselves."
Frankly, other than maybe the provocative title that was at one with the ho=
t
button gender issues of the time, it was the most difficult issue of the
magazine that I ever edited. With the exception of a very few pieces, littl=
e
of the poetry or prose matched the subject (it was either enormous psychic
stress over the issue or Jungian "anima" re-runs). If, as an editor I
thought I was to find real articulations. I was mostly unsatisfied, as were
many readers looking for same.
I think it's still a deeply provocative question/issue - perhaps more for
"straight"  men than folks of other or multiple "gender" identifications.
(It is not a concern I suspect among "straights", for example, when one say=
s
"Pinksy", or "Collins" or... Perhaps, though, often implicit to the work of
Creeley or ...) But I think discussion ploughs "looking" at it again.
Certainly there is a much greater body of writing available now than in
1974, and kari's work is clearly working away at ripping apart static
envelopes.=20
Excuse me if I am anecdotal, but I am reminded of my chiropractor who, late
to our appointment, explained that he had been in a huge argument with the
mother of his children. "Jesus," he said, "Most of us have a fifty or maybe
a hundred people running around inside us, but, at least, we occasionally
stop to call a meeting. She never stops."
What's inside? Various with the day, multiple men, women, children,
ancestors, the unborn, professionals,  poets, self-hating poets, lovers,
haters, fuck-ups, etc., etc. The more, the more unstable, possibly - by
virtue of the risk of the larger horizon and  delivered with real skill -
the richest, most interesting work.

From 1965 to 1974 or so I still find either a romanticized or violently
repressed period of American history. For much of the country it was the
second Civil War - all the wounds seemed up, exposed and charged with chang=
e
-  the historical memory of which, particularly beginning with Reagan was
subsequently given a heavy Teflon coating.

Thanks for this, Joe.  As an AARP member there's not much I can do but
resign, though, unless there is a better organization for sane seniors?

In dismantling rules, word-virus creates what Deleuze refers to as "the
Ideal game."
He writes:
    The unique cast is a chaos, each throw of which is a fragment. Each
throw operates a distribution of singularities, a constellation. But instead
of dividing a closed space between fixed results which correspond to
hypotheses, the mobile results are distributed in the open space of the
unique and undivided cast. This is a nomadic and non-sedentary distribution,
wherein each system of singularities communicates and resonates with the
others, being at once implicated by the others and implicating them in the
most important cast. It is the game of problems and of the questions, no
longer the game of the categorical and the hypothetical.

The Weather Underground:
"Hello, I'm going to read a declaration of a state of war...within the next
14 days we will attack a symbol or institution of American injustice." ~
Bernardine Dohrn

In October 1969 hundreds of young people, clad in football helmets and
wielding lead pipes, marched through an upscale Chicago shopping district,
pummeling parked cars and smashing shop windows in their path.
This was the first demonstration of the Weather Underground's "Days of
Rage." Outraged by the Vietnam War and racism in America, the organization
waged a low-level war against the U.S. government through much of the 1970s,
bombing the Capitol building, breaking Timothy Leary out of prison, and
evading one of the largest FBI manhunts in history.
http://www.upstatefilms.org/weather/main.html

The Weather Underground functioned within the possibility of infection. The
group was comprised mostly of what is understood as "the white
middle-class." Because of their ability to become "invisible" or "blend in"
they could enter public institutions at will, planting their resistance in
the institutions, dismantling the symbolism of America.

Poetic Terrorism

WEIRD DANCING IN ALL-NIGHT computer-banking lobbies.
Unauthorized pyrotechnic displays. Land-art, earth-works as
bizarre alien artifacts strewn in State Parks. Burglarize
houses but instead of stealing, leave Poetic-Terrorist
objects. Kidnap someone & make them happy.
Pick someone at random & convince them they're the heir to
an enormous, useless & amazing fortune--say 5000 square
miles of Antarctica, or an aging circus elephant, or an
orphanage in Bombay, or a collection of alchemical mss.
Later they will come to realize that for a few moments they
believed in something extraordinary, & will perhaps be
driven as a result to seek out some more intense mode of
existence.

Bolt up brass commemorative plaques in places (public or
private) where you have experienced a revelation or had a
particularly fulfilling sexual experience, etc.

Go naked for a sign.

****
Authority is always dead & conservatism is always a nostalgia for the corpse
that never was or the memory of a future devoid of movement. Civilization is
but a long funeral procession winding (blank)'s way through history.

In the cellars and boundaries the nomads hide, reciting word-virus to expel
the ghost of hierarchy.
****
Infection is a continuous process, like water (blank)'s only relationship to
surfaces is the form by which it emerges.

Hi Poetics Folks--

I'm looking for a citation for the following statement:

It went something like: "the farther apart the two things being compared,
the stronger the metaphor."

I thought it was Reverdy who said this, but I can't find evidence of it
anywhere.  If anybody can help with a citation, please backchannel.

Many Thanks,

Dear Friends,

Two friends of the poetry community, Todd Colby and his wife Elizabeth, had
an apartment on Monitor Street in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in the middle of th=
e
block, where a huge fire occurred on Wed. (Eleven houses were caught up in
it.) They're okay, but their apartment was severely damaged, most of their
possessions were lost, and they had to vacate. They need a new one
immediately (and permanently). They're a couple, a poet and a visual artist=
,
and they have cats. They're very nice, responsible people and both have
steady jobs. If anyone has any leads on apartments=8Bthey can pay up to $1300
a month--please write by e-mail as soon as possible to Todd at
toddjcolby@aol.com. Please also cc friend Gabriel Cohen at
jknipl@earthlink.net.

Thanks enormously for any help you might be able to give.

Best,

The Poetry Project

Swinging, we must be happy.



There is truth in the epithets we choose.



There is wintered-over booze, and your bony

legs astride the hobby horse that is.



My one, my gone.



Last night I slept in a bed with a woman,

our heads where our feet should be,



window open singing of you, too-thin and ruby

over by the sparrow’s nest,

on the ledge with the asters.



My gone, my lone.



Phases:  passing over, crossing over, chasing a
plover.



Brains: fancy, crepe-like.  Watching over,

A god bigger than the poet. Bigger than the Beatles.



My broken, my bone.



My fancy thing, O filthy last.

kari, you wrote today,

"I do not think I ("the plural we / me") or someone or anyone was
stating an objection to the use of the *word(s)*"

hmmm.  weren't you the person who originated the post with the subject line:

"is there a problem using the word hermaphrodite in a poem?"

the words "the word" in other words?

yes, it is about the words.  all your other arguments are just that,
other arguments.  but the original argument was about words.

or are we now substituting words in poems with interpretative dance?
i have nothing against interpretative dance mind you, i'm just asking.

it's ironic that you want to educate and promote sensitivity, yet you
resort to boycotting readings and favor censorship.

i'm not sure who sold you our language, but if i were you
i'd call the bank and put a STOP on that check.

any poet worth their salt would take it back from you anyway.

my friend Janet Mason was so annoyed when her workshop
instructor insisted she stop using the word "cunt" in her poems
that she used that anger to write her amazing poem "The Cunt Sonnet"

it's the poets with the courage to write what they are told they
Should Not who wind up touching us deepest, did you notice?

by the way, all your picket signs might as well read
"BUY THIS BOOK!"  because i can't WAIT to read it!
not only that, but a couple of friends of mine from LA
read the posts protesting tonight's reading and they're
taking off work early to drive to San Francisco JUST to
make the reading.  Koeneke doesn't need an agent, just
this poetics list.

I'm increasingly disturbed by the combative tone of this whole discussion,
especially as the representation of various persons' positions is beginning
to get more and more distorted.  I am in part responsible for this.  When
I said I was sorry that kari was "boycotting" the reading, I was responding
to her statement "I will not be attending the reading this friday ... and let
SPT know why...."  I should have chosen my words more carefully (once
again).  Since this post, other List members have adopted the "boycott"
terminology, inspired by my example, I fear.  More alarmingly, some of
those recent posts have seemed to create the impression that there
are two camps, with kari on one side and myself and Rodney on the other.
Rodney and kari and I are all friendly with each other, and will I hope
continue to be so.  It's great to hear that people are driving all the way from
southern California to see Rodney read, but they should do so because of
his poetry, not in order to create the impression of divisive rifts between
parties who wish each other no ill will whatsoever.  Rodney certainly would
not want this, I believe I can safely say.

Breton quotes Reverdy in "Manifesto of Surrealism:

The image is a pure creation of the mind.

It cannot be born from a comparison but from a juxtaposition of two more or
less distant realities.

The more the relationship between the two juxtaposed realities is distant
and true, the stronger the image will be--the greater its emotional power
and poetic reality.

[Seaver and Lane translation from the U. of Michigan edition (1969).]

Hi Poetics Folks--

I'm looking for a citation for the following statement:

It went something like: "the farther apart the two things being compared,
the stronger the metaphor."

I thought it was Reverdy who said this, but I can't find evidence of it
anywhere.  If anybody can help with a citation, please backchannel.

Many Thanks,

Anyone know where I can find a membership list for the surrealist movement?

A serious question: there was in fact an official membership, as wacky as
that seems.

For a current membership list - complete with instructions on how to be
considered for such - I have been told you can start with a query to
"HotelRumsfeldWolfowitz@Donkeycart.Baghdad.Org"
It's my understanding, Mark, that you will be given instructions on how to
proceed through links to the membership list. People who have already done
this suggest avoiding any links to the "Naked Corpse" where, apparently,
dead counter terrorist manifestos, and other WMD 'intelligence statements'
appear bloodied and pungent with the smell of dead flesh. Most of the poetry
is found in the vault where it is leaned up against a Sumerian harp which
is, apparently, as much as possible, granted safe keeping by Hotel
Management, though there are some detractors who claim the Surrealists are
aiming to spirit the Harp out the country and trade it for pension money on
the European black market. Old age benefits have apparently superceded
interest in the music and images from the ancient collective unconscious.
You  know who you can call, Mark, if you get lost in the mix, and, may safe
linking and journey be my wish for you.

Protests Greet Sentence for Bush Hate Mail
Fri Nov 21,11:31 AM ET  Add Oddly Enough - Reuters to
My Yahoo!



LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenian human rights activists
on Friday condemned a court's decision to sentence a
man for "terrorist" crimes for sending hate e-mail to
President Bush (news - web sites).



Tomi Sluga, 29, told the local court in the
northeastern town of Murska Sobota he was drunk and
only joking when he sent an e-mail to the White House
web before a June 2001 Bush visit to the small Alpine
state.


"President, save the Earth, you ass, you will be
killed in Ljubljana. Welcome!" the email read.


The court found Sluga guilty of "endangering a
protected person" and gave him a two-year suspended
sentence on Monday, the first conviction under
Slovenia's new anti-terrorism laws.


Protesters from several rights group demonstrated
outside the supreme court in Ljuljana, demanding
Sluga's case be reconsidered.


"It is an exaggeration that has nothing to do with
security," Gorazd Kovacic of the local Mirovni
Institut (Peace Institute) told Reuters.


"We wanted to protest against the court's senseless
decision to sentence a person for terrorism just for
sending an e-mail," said Marta Gregorcic, a prominent
rights activist who was among the three dozen
demonstrators.


Slovenia broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991 and is due
to join the European Union (news - web sites) in May.

Kasey,
any reason to go to a poetry reading is fine.
once he and Mytili start reading, whatever
reasons drove people to drive there will dissolve.

to be honest, if i lived anywhere near San Francisco
and read about the controversy, my interest would be
sparked.  because of all this we've recently seen a
post on this list with 2 poems from the book
in question, and it looks like a good book.
and i'm glad that the publisher made the price
available at the top of that post:  $12 post paid.
my order will be in the mail soon.

The article offers "caucasian" for a few of the women but as for most of
the women offers no other decription. Are we to assume that they are not
caucasian and list them as"'other"?

Further thoughts on a grassroots takeover of AARP?

tom bell:


Boy, I don't know.  This kind of surprised me.  I hadn't expected AARP to
turn on us and side with bush.
I do have a way of sending email fairly efficiently, although it's getting
much harder because so many of them are going to those forms you have to
fill out.

Here are the web addresses that are handy to have for these times when you
feel like smacking them around.  Sometimes I just watch CSpan as I'm
emailing the jerks and call their offices when they say stupid things.

Senate:
http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm
House:
http://www.house.gov/house/MemberWWW.html

It's easier if you just click on the ones that are direct emails, then type
your message once.  Copy and paste it into all the others.  You can email
the entire Senate in 10 minutes that way instead of trying to compose it
over and over.

Here are three websites that are very informative, especially regarding all
the things you never see in the news.  If you will sign up at MoveOn.org,
they will send you emails that are time sensitive on issues like this one
today and the FCC thing a couple of months ago.  It's really great to be a
part of a movement that accomplishes something once in a while.  All of
these are safe and they don't send viruses.  They're easy to opt out of
also, if you decide to.  I never get spam from them.

Tom,
You must either be joking here, or uninformed!  AARP ain't no saint.  =
Simple facts of life: AARP is a mega millions industry having made it's =
original $'s by insuring old folks.  But it is, none the less, a major =
business and one of the nation's largest, funded special interest groups =
in D.C.  Worse, they really don't, repeat, "Don't" represent the old =
codgers!  They represent only their profit margins...most of the cash =
made from programs important to silverheads. =20

Want to clean up Washington?  Eliminate special interest groups! =20

Top 3 SIG's:  folks from Pharmacy, # 1;  folks from enery/oil, # 2; old =
folks from AARP, #3.  (this of course doesn't count the $'s spent by =
unions jointly but tabulated individually as separate units.  Fact is, =
if you add all the individual units here into a total, they are the #1 =
lobby group in the nation. And none of them is above reproach...IMO.

Alex,
    It's a very peculiar 'membership' organization where the members
apparently have no say.  I'm paging through their message board and a lot of
people are discovering this tonight with the vote going on in the house.
Sadly, people are resigning rather than reforming AARP.  Hope this changes
before the election   Geezers need a better voice.

If you want to be removed from my list, please reply with "remove", or a synonym for "remove" such as "delete" or "take off", in the subject line. I will then do that. But I would recommend hanging in there because there won't be another issue of Wegway for six months or so and that means this email source will be relatively quiet for a while.

In case -as with myself - you are totally fed up and suspicious with
Military to Corporate channel updates on the 'progress in Iraq', I suggest
reading this running blog account of the Occupation from a more than ever
bewildered Iraqi resident point of view.

http://riverbendblog.blogspot.com/

Hi recent takes on the new military offensive are particularly refreshing -
both sad and comic - even as he induces the strong impression that the US is
run by some seriously deluded Schizophrenics who have absolutely no clue as
to where they are, what they are doing and why.

Grievous.

I probably shouldn't say anything here but suffice it to say that I thought that
transgender people were mostly having a lot of fun due to movies like La Cage
Aux Folles and movies with Dustin Hoffman and Steve Martin where they have women
inside of them or something -- I had no idea what these people are really going
through.  Kari -- who I didn't previously know -- wrote a backchannel very nice
straightforward account of what she's experienced as a therapist over nine years
in San Francisco -- police beating and raping transgender inmates -- police
harassing these people -- to the point that some words have taken on a very deep
meaning for her -- she has much more context for her decision than probably I
could humanly absorb in nine lifetimes (but I absorbed enough to feel much more
sensitivity about the matter) -- but she never threatened a boycott -- she made
that clear in another frontlisted post.  She's just feeling kind of tired and
disgusted -- I got an inkling of this through her backchannel posts -- and have
stayed up for two nights feeling like hell that I didn't know about this world
that these people are having to endure, to the point that I didn't even think it
was true.  I now know differently.  At any rate, I shouldn't be speaking for
anybody else, but she did say about twenty posts back or so that she supported
the reading in principle, but didn't want to go.  She has a right to that,
right?  Just as everybody is supporting the right to attend.  And nobody is
talking about censorship.  Just trying to feel the enormous weight of the words
that we are using to those who are really living within them.

At any rate, go!  And write a report about it.  I want to know more about this.

The Dictionary of Surrealism edited by Jose Pierre has a pretty good list of
all the members, plus mini-biographies.

The surrealists' leader was Andre Breton, and he excommunicated people all the
time.  So the list is not stable.  Almost every year there were
excommunications.  At some points there were as many as sixty members, at other
points there were less.  And some members were thrown out and later
readmitted.   When Breton died in 1966 the movement lost most of its momentum.
In 1969, it was decided by the remaining members to officially dissolve the
movement.

However, there is a group in Paris that still calls itself the surrealist
movement.  I have known some of their members.  Most agree that this group
doesn't have the talent or power of the original group, but some of these
people are very interesting.  I knew a marginal member of the group in Finland
(he was a neighbor) by the name of Philippe Jacob.  He has written very good
poems, but he doesn't publish them.  He only shows them to a few friends.

There are any number of histories of the movement, but one that I'm partially
to is Raoul Vaneigem's book A Cavalier History of Surrealism, published by AK
Press.  Vaneigem wrote the book in three days, but it has some of the zest and
inventiveness that the original surrealists had.  Vaneigem was a member of the
situationist group that was big in the fifties and sixties, and borrowed from
surrealism and tried to mix it with what I consider to be Lukacian Marxism.

If you read French the best insider account is Philippe Soupault's Memoires de
lOublie 1923-1926 as this was the heroic stage of the movement.  All their best
stuff was being written at that point.  After the thirties Breton was their
greatest writer.  I especially love Arcane 17, when he turned toward an
ecological feminism shortly after the Second World War, in which he mentions a
Canadian island called Roc Perce as the new Notre Dame -- an unihabited island
off the Canadian coast and in existence for thirty thousand years!

I appreciate all responses, front and backchannel. I'm not really looking
for a history of the movement--I'm reasonably familiar with it--just for as
complete a list as I can find of 1920s and 30s members--I'll try the
dictionary--to see if I can figure out some of the unacknowledged criteria
for Breton's choice of who to include and who to exclude.

Dear Friends:




My new book, Narrative of Power: Essays for an Endangered Century, is
just out from Common Courage Press in Maine. Common Courage is one of
the few small truly independent presses left in this age of corporate
everything. It publishes Chombsky, Zinn, Harbury, Farmer, etc. Because
they don't have a huge advertising budget, I am taking it upon myself to
tell you about the book, and to urge you to order a copy from their
website (commoncouragepress.com) or your local independent bookseller.




Some of you are mentioned in this book. Some have shared experiences
about which I write. Some will no doubt recognize moments where our
lives have intersected. All of you are as concerned as I am about the
current state of political takeover and what we might do about it. The
essays are all about power, but the subjects range from memory, women
who row the Colorado River, and lesbian motherhood to shame as a
political weapon, fundamentalism, and of course 9/11.
Thank you so much for your support.




In struggle, Margaret.

Subject:      Re: Hermaphrodites and Violence
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Can we not play at being hermaphroditic? Apart from
the issue of whether an hermaphrodite has or has not
refined itself through a physical operation, I think
poems, like people, are hermaphroditic by nature.

I also prefer the idea of a poet who changes her
gender and orientation several times in a poem.
Crossing over and back within the poem prevents the
false modesty we might otherwise fall prey to if we
really conceived ourselves as either/or. Quite
possibly, we are both (sexes), despite one being
dominant, physical, and at times invasive.

I assume no one is suggesting that we gingerly remove
violence from language. Removal is the most violent of
acts, and its reaction can only be doubly violent.
Also, silence might precede violence just as easily as
mimicking violence might precede violence. There is no
way around it. I feel far safer having accustomed
myself to violent language, because I would rather
look at the possibilities of living, and dying. I feel
these things through language, either in lieu of, in
imitation of, or in preparation of their fulfillment.

I think it is far better to train ourselves for what
violence will come (even if our next encounter with
violence is the last and greatest, death) than to
forget that we have experienced it (even if our
previous encounter with violence was the first and
smallest, birth).

Then, of course, there are those of us who pleasure
each other with small plays of violence, and love each
other the more after each strike. I am not talking
here of a deviant sexuality, but simple daily human
intercourse. But I'm afraid with this last
observation, I may be steering away from the topic at
hand.

Best,
Stacey Duff

we are (both sexes)... its to bad there is just two . .  I know of many
more.. at least a hundred or so..

and yes, why not play at a phallocentic romanticized construction and
ignore the reality that intersexed folks in history that has been
murdered..  . . yes, lets please continue to use the myth of old and
those romantic gesture of misogynistic gaze... the hermaphrodite is a
myth.. an ideal..... what is it..  the one considered a freak in the
middle age and considered an evil manifestation or the one as a
fetish...

maybe.. just maybe, the reliance in antiquated term limits our
possibilities.. if gender is perfomrative why use a noun to describe
is.. think of new ways to perform and speak of it... I know there is
not noun that can contain me.. why relying on the simplistic approach
of the binary-.. why only imagine two genders ( which is not a sex-
sex is what you do in bed.. gender is who you play at when you are
having sex..)...


I also like a poet who changes genders and has sex all the time, but
why use pronouns.. does that not limit us. why situate . . . . as they
say: just do it... the government already situates-.. are we trying to
be like the government.... if we are to truly break the wall of
gender.. resist the binary..

and I am not.. both sexes.. I have sex.. I am not and every conceivable
gender... and what is deviant sex.. truly.. who is setting what
limits.. and who is to say... diviant sexuality.. I do not know what
that is...  diviant  to some is anything not the missionary position
between a person with a penis and one with a vagina.. to some diviant
sexuality is the missionary position between a person with a penis and
one with a vagina...... I am talking fucking.. sex.. hot sex.. sex with
many different genders with snap on parts.. why limit it..

any natural, bodily metaphor attached to poetry has already ascribed itself
to the realm of the mind when it is represented in language.  therefore it
is dangerous to begin slagging away with social containers for the
nonrecoupable, labels designed to help identify only limit, and then somehow
link that to poetry.  the two may relate, but it is a fraught connection as
we have discovered through the length of this thread.  so why bother
connecting physicality and poetry?  poetry, unless it is purely gestural
(and even then this is questionable) is a result of the mind.  i guess all
things bodily spring from the mind, but until that is related in language
this is a non recouperable and therefore safely bodily event.  the minute
these discussions enter into language, sexes the word, genders the word, our
intentions immediately become suspect because of our involvement in despotic
social systems (call them government, identity, relationships, even self).
so it is not cool to associate hermaphrodatism and poetry.  poetry is
poetry.  hermaprhoditism is hermaphroditism.  the two may have similarities,
but so do cows and sheep. saturn has moons too!

vive!

Spammers and Flamers

This group is as underground as the literary world descends - a cesspool. Spammers and flamers and
every other nemesis of literary decorum is invited. Spoken word divas and sphincter-plugged
academicians will eat my poopy. Anyone starting a thread or discussion will eat my poopy. Vulgarity,
obscenity, explicit sexual language, indecency of every kind, political incorrectness and any other
form of outrageousness is tolerated. Material with nuance, ironic tension and aesthete refinement is
accepted, but only out of liberal open-mindedness. Geniuses and morons are treated with equal
disrepect. This group is unmoderated. It was conceived of by August Highland, the enfant horrible
and literary statesman of the world of letters, after a traumatic experience during an invitation to
the White House, at which time he was molested by the First Lady who, after drugging him with
Rohypnol, straddled his face while the President aggressively assaulted his arse without a condom,
transmitting the AIDS virus to August who then transmitted it to his wife.

words are gendered...? does it have to be...

and do we need to be stuck in the construct of the realm of the known?
cannot anyone write from the body through the mind? can we never us
pataphysics and the poetic practice to write beyond the minds
construct...?. ..  I do not know ... these our just questions.... but I
am not sure all things body spring from the mind... that seems a rather
one ways street...  rather , it seems as if the body (perception, and
sensation) are filtered through the mind as language metaphors. and if
we are writing the body or of the body in the world, being in the
world, would it not be helpful to know the limitation, history, and
constructs of the language we use? I maybe missing your definition of
nonrecoupable.. so I do apologize if I miss interpret, but it seems if
it is all nonrecoupable except the corporeal state and if we use
corperalized gender in reference to a poetics practice.. which I am
sure some people do to speaking of experiences.. such as .. sex. .. how
do you write it without signifying the experience to a threshold of
solidity and still speak of the body?.. these are just questions.. ...

I am not sure who said anything about not connecting physicality to
poetry?..... I was just saying using tired metaphors could be a problem
and if I understand you, using old metaphor  in poetry to speak of the
body do nothing but restratify the body and experience to a social
container.... so.. how does one speak of an experience that takes one
out of the corporal body?

What disturbs me about this whole discussion is the programmatic aspects
of it - and the reliance on essentilism and the privilege of one
population bearing witness against another - on one hand I agree with kari
- on the other, the virulance of the text - involving murder below -
limits other folks' experience.

it's through playing one learns and communicates - so it's ironic that
her text - which appears to some extent as a limiting text itself -
desires openness and not limiting our possibilities -

for me, all of this tends to an aporia - there's no way out - simply given
in to reported experiences - the boundaries are impenetrable etc. - which
I think is far more hurtful as a form of censorship or self-censorship
than exploration -

apologies if I'm missing the point here -

I don't know of a hundred sexes by the way - continuums of desires yes -
even this - if one believes in two sexes or just one - why not explore
that? - alan

Hi All. Can anyone point me in the direction of any manual letterpress machines that are available for sale. Frankly I'm not getting out of photocopying what I used to. If anyone can give me the name of an individual or business, that would be most helpful. I'm counting on pressing YOUR books with style and respectability. Hmm, where did that come from?

Thanks, from the bttom of my stte of the rt

Chris

There's an incredible feeding going on in Congress right now. Even in the
Reagan years, I don't remember seeing such obvious greed on a daily basis.
It's truly like Orwell's "Animal Farm." It seems if as Neo-cons and their
corporate partners are stuffing themselves while they can get away with it,
while the credit lasts. I've seen dictators grabbing the loot, but this is
the most self-destructive frenzy I've ever seen in this country.
Or have we become a corporate dictatorship but can't yet admit it? Is the
government being drained and we are really paying taxes to corporations?

An issue that I see coming up again and again in my admittedly spotty
reading of this tread is the difference between writing out of some
sort of lived experience versus playing around with constructs.
There's an enormous difference between reading Judith Butler on
gender performance and immersing oneself in the young radical queer
scene here in San Francisco, which is thrilling and a bit scary in
its radical reinvention of gender, where what most of the world would
call "men" are called "bio-boys."  I'm too old to do any radical
reinvention of myself at this point--I kind of feel like I missed the
boat on this one--but living in this scene has made me much more
comfortable in my body and more willing to think "fuck you" when it's
clear that I'm not performing the acceptable social codes of a middle
aged middle class poetry lady.

Let's face it, there aren't a lot of gender warriors out there in the
experimental poetry.  Playing around with constructs is fine--but I
champion writing, including experimental poetry, that comes from a
place of lived experience.  As Maggie Z. and I were bemoaning the
other day, most of the writing coming out of the active SF queer
writing scene is pretty sappy.  Which brings up the old question,
does political poetry need to be good poetry.  On one level, no, but
I hope we'd all strive for it to be.  Kari's marrying of
experimentation with lived gender alterity is very important.

How could anybody accuse Kari of essentialism and then declare that
the mind and the body are separate entities?  That dichotomy is at
the root of the sickness we call western culture.

I do think that if Kari were writing from any other "minority"
opinion Kari would be getting a hell of a lot more support here--and
wouldn't feel the need to shout.  I don't think that one has to damn
Kasey and Rodney, who I'm sure did not intend to offend anybody, in
order to take in what Kari's saying.

although i've already made myself abundantly clear about where
i disagree with kari edwards and why, her ideas of more than
two genders makes sense, and has many historical contexts.

the book that opened my eyes for the first time that gender can
be as much a continuum as desire was THE CHANGING ONES.
Will Roscoe's research into the study of Native American cultures
and their belief in 3, 4, or more genders, is essential
reading for anyone interested exploring the mysteries
of gender our culture has long since buried.

like our need for a singular God, with the end of pagan culture
was also the end of the infinite possibilities for our bodies.

here's a link:
http://www.geocities.com/westhollywood/stonewall/3044/changing.html

but we needn't stop with Native American cultures.  Freya Asswyn,
a well known scholar in ancient Nordic runes from Holland, now living
in London, has often made mention of ancient European cultures
also believing in multiple genders.  and in some cases, much the
way hermaphrodites are revered in parts of India, these people were
considered among the holiest, those who walk on All sides, and were
often sought out for spiritual guidance.

it's no big surprise that with the resurgence of pagan culture and
pagan spirituality, we will also now rekindle a sense of who we are
as flesh.  happy transforming everyone.

Dodie,

thanks for sharing all that you did.

when i think about gender warriors, Leslie Fienberg comes to mind,
mainly because of her title TRANSGENDER WARRIORS, but also
because i've seen her talk, and have felt that warrior experience in
her words.

her example is what i'd would rather follow.  as an activist, she said
she got her start in labor, unionizing, etc.  she said herself that
at the time she pretty much looked like a dyke and there was little
she could do about it.  she received a LOT of verbal abuse from
her fellow organizers and many other people in the labor movement.
what did she do?  she acted like a warrior, NOT a worrier, in other
words she KEPT going and going and going, despite it all.  and she
won them the fuck over with her ability to look them in the fucking
eye and talk to them as they would want to be talked to by their friends.
she disarmed them.  she didn't hold a gun to their heads and demand
that they NOT use this word or that word.  all the words were coming
at her, and she kept going.  and she changed them.  and she changed
their language in the organic way language will change.

after her talk (which was at the main Quaker Meeting Hall in Philadelphia)
i was moved to tell her briefly about my own life, how my boyfriend had
been driven to suicide because of high school, and how i wanted to blow the
fucking school up, kill everyone inside, even myself.  i was pretty raw
that year i heard her speak, and i think she could see that.  and she
put her hand on my shoulder and she said, "but you didn't kill them,
and you're still here, keep fighting.  don't let them turn you into someone
you don't want to become.  as long as you remain who you know you
are they can't touch you, and you may even change them into who
they really want to be."

this was years ago, all of it, including Leslie Fienberg's talk at the
Quaker Hall, but the potency hasn't diminished, not at all.

when i think of the original subject line in this thread of e-mails
"is there a problem using the word hermaphrodite in a poem?"
i want to come right out and say NO!  there is no problem.
in fact, i'd have to say this, if i believe in the unlimited possibilities
of gender and desire.  in fact, everyone and anyone should write
poems about how they even feel themselves to be spiritual
hermaphrodites, or whatever kind of hermaphrodites.

Blavatsky was a hermaphrodite, according to elders at the
original Lodge of Theosophy, and her belief always seemed
to not only withstand the forces against us to build our
spiritual bodies, but also be aware of how in withstanding
forces, we are transforming ourselves, and that force
we are withstanding.

Craig:

Just want to thank you for this reference.
In my Sasquatch project, I'm working on the threshold between animal and
human forms, the interchanges between, and therianthropic imperative, which
is related to the hermaphrodite. I suspect I'll find parallels in this book.

Best,
Joel

You might want to check out the Kinsey Report, which discussed the sexual
continuum in terms of our own society and described a bunch of genders
plucked from the continuum. That's what, 50 years ago?

While I hold no brief for monotheism, lots of pagan (or better,
polytheistic) cultures were just as restrictive as Western European
Christianity.

I think the term is Corporativist Republic like Mussolini's Italy, Peron's
Argentina and Franco's Spain
it seems out friends in the GOP have decided that this form of govt is
better than a democratic republic.

Yes, I totally think that there is a difference between lived experience and
theoretical positioning. And of course there is overlap in theories of being
and actual being which I find interesting in art making and society forming.
    But we cannot all just lay claim to that terrain without in a sense
realizing that it can be poaching. And it  seems that kari is also trying to
demystify and de-glamourize this, as opposed to examine spiritual or
symbolic manifestations of "Hermaproditism".  Some people live their
material existence here.

There is also a difference in intensity between feeling threatened by
disagreement, and feeling eradicated by not being seen. And I do think that
if the issue being discussed here were that of any other "minority" it would
be discussed with more of an awareness of that delicate dance between
theoretical places and lived experience.

I agree with Dodie's observations and am glad she made 'em. And I think for
my own very small part of this discussion I'm done now.

that again.  I guess it was like the one time I got drunk.  It just
seemed kind of weird and left me wondering why people did that.

There is a very short addendum -- the poet Robert Peters informed me by
letter that intercrural sex (cock between thighs of partner, with
dominant partner on top) was the standard practice for the Greeks -- and
not anal sex.  It's one of those bits of information that you rarely get
-- the kind that just might help you get more money if you're ever on
the millionaire show.

hey kirby, i think i remember talking about this w/ you back then.
you were a cute skinny kid w/ braces who liked to talk about acid cut
w/ strychnine.  i was a bookish girls-school-cum-Hampshire-College
girl, totally bewildered by all the sex coming at me from both the
older profs and the younger male students (though they were far less
intimidating), and remember larry fagin announcing to our class that
i "had latin" by way of accentuating my literary credentials.

the publication of:

THE ESCAPE
by Jo Ann Wasserman


Thursday, December 11, 2003
7:00 P.M., FREE

Teachers & Writers Collaborative
5 Union Square West, 7th Floor, NYC
(between 14th and 15th Sts.)

with readings by Wasserman, Brenda Coultas, David Cameron & Gillian
McCain
& Wine and cheese reception.


"In these brilliant sestinas of assemblage and their tenuous enkomion
asides, the reader is taken/taking place, as if in detailed alignment
with the poet-family footage scattered over the floor and glued back
warily as Wasserman constructs her map of escape from that loving
tyranny.  An extraordinary first book in which every utterance is
compelled by the imagination's fleeing from the known."
- Kathleen Fraser

"The Escape is a kinetic maelstrom in which Wasserman's attention is
always laconic and precise...a calmly breathless, run-on sentence that
gathers information at every instant, while careening downhill...prose
where diary and fiction slip around each other...a music that is
intoxicating and unmistakable in its honoring of the turbulence of
being alive in the not so distant present, past and future."
- John Yau

"There is much at stake in this book: 'motherhood, fortune, providence,
the stars and then depression...the false Italy' or false anything vs.
a real me or you.  This book is 'round, soft, sad, expensive,
pink'...it is also dark, sharp-limbed, heart-wrenching, hilarious and
smart.  Kafka once declared ' A book must be the axe for the frozen sea
within us.' In form and in content, this is one of the bravest books of
poetry I've read."
- Eleni Sikelianos

JO ANN WASSERMAN is the author  of two chapbooks of poetry "What Counts
As Proof (Sugarbooks) and "We Build Mountains" (a+bend press).  Her
work has appeared in The World, Grand Street, can we have our ball
back? and The East Village.  She is the former Managing Editor of How2,
an online journal of innovative writing by women, and former Program
Coordinator at The Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church. She recently
earned an M.F.A. in poetics from the New College of California and
currently lives in New York City where she works for Granary Books.

The Escape is book #3 in the Futurepoem series, selected by 2002/03
editors Brenda Coultas, Anselm Berrigan, Laird Hunt and Dan Machlin.

[piece below. btw I do agree in all of this w/ kari - I have been reading
and rereading. I have constantly worried about 'Nikuko' and 'Jennifer' and
the like - writing out of another gender - not to mention country (Japan
and England) - not to mention blurred speciation (Julu). and I hope what
I've been offering isn't prejudice, but an opening. I'd like to see as
many openings as possible, as long as they're _openings,_ misrecognitions
perhaps that tend towards greater or different comprehension or even
problematizing comprehension itself. I worry about my own limited
experience and the limited experience of others - writing is one way to
fall off the cliff, whether or not the cliff is of one's own making) - btw
the piece below in no way relates to the discussion, at least as far as I
can tell - alan.]

PATENTS
The Muse Is in the Software
By TERESA RIORDAN

"INVENTING is about catching the wave," said Ray Kurzweil, who addressed
a national convention of inventors in Philadelphia last Monday. "Most
inventions fail not because the inventor can't get them to work but
because the invention comes at the wrong time."

Mr. Kurzweil should know. An inventor in the field of artificial
intelligence, he has started and sold several companies for millions of
dollars.

On Nov. 11, Mr. Kurzweil and John Keklak, an engineer, received patent
No. 6,647,395, covering what Mr. Kurzweil calls a cybernetic poet.
Essentially, it is software that allows a computer to create poetry by
imitating but not plagiarizing the styles and vocabularies of human
poets.

It works something like a cyberblender. The poetically challenged (or
those with temporary writer's block) can toss in rhymes and rhythms and
alliterations from already written poems. These whir around a bit, then
out pours a new poem.

Here is a poem the cybernetic poet wrote after "reading" poems by Wendy
Dennis, a poet employed by Mr. Kurzweil:

Sashay down the page

through the lioness

nestled in my soul.

While other poetry-generating software exists, Mr. Kurzweil said, it is
less sophisticated.

"Those are fixed, fill-in-the-blank approaches that resemble the Mad
Libs game," he said. "They are not really trying to create new patterns
based on a more flexible pattern structure."

Many of Mr. Kurzweil's inventions, including the cybernetic poet, are
based on pattern recognition. "The real power of human thinking is based
on recognizing patterns," he said. The better computers get at pattern
recognition, the more humanlike they will become.

Mr. Kurzweil said he knew he wanted to be an inventor from the age of 5.
By the time he was 16, he had invented a computer that composed melodies
based on pattern recognition. He and his melody-generating machine
appeared on the television show "I've Got a Secret."

By the age of 28, he had invented a print-to-speech reading machine for
the blind that caught the attention of the composer and performer Stevie
Wonder.

Mr. Kurzweil's talk in Philadelphia was a significant change of pace for
last week's two-day conference, sponsored by the United States Patent
and Trademark Office. Other speakers covered the nitty-gritty of "claim
construction" and "prior art" while Mr. Kurzweil mused about the brave
new world of technology.

Were he not such a successful entrepreneur, Mr. Kurzweil might be
considered something of a crackpot. In his book "The Age of Spiritual
Machines'' (Penguin, 2000), he envisions a world in the near future
where computers superannuate humans - they compose music and poetry,
have sex with each other, and achieve a humanlike consciousness.

"We will cross the threshold where we have hybrid or nonbiological
humans," Mr. Kurzweil said in a phone interview last week. "Our
biological thinking is fixed. But our nonbiological thinking" - by which
he means machine intelligence - "will grow exponentially."

Mr. Kurzweil roams from the philosophical to the practical. During his
talk in Philadelphia, he offered practical tips on how inventors can
harness their ideas.

He advocates what he calls lucid dreaming - harnessing the unconscious
to work on problems while sleeping.

"When I go to sleep I assign myself a problem, without trying to solve
the problem," he said. Then during his waking moments, between
consciousness and slumber, he revisits the problem. "It is a great time
for creative thinking," he said. "You can think of new connections, new
approaches that you wouldn't otherwise think of."

So does Mr. Kurzweil predict that his cybernetic poet will "catch the
wave"?

"This is a useful aid to real-life poets looking for inspiration or for
help with alliteration or rhyming," he said. "But I am not intending for
it to be a huge money maker."

A version of the cybernetic poet can be downloaded free from
www.kurzweilcyberart.com. The deluxe version is $29.95.

Barking up the wrong bush

Toronto Star
Nov 21, 2003

As it happened, the two principal sponsors of the invasion of Iraq,
U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
were together when news came in that 27 more people had been killed
in the third and fourth suicide bomb attacks in Istanbul in one week.
They had to say something, and so they both tried to twist the
atrocities into a justification of their decision to invade Iraq.

This would be almost funny if it wasn't so horrible, because the two
incidents probably occurred because Bush and Blair invaded Iraq.

"What this latest terrorist outrage shows us is that there is a war-
and its main battleground is in Iraq," said Blair. Bush picked up the
theme, declaring, "Our mission in Iraq is noble and it is necessary,
and no act of thugs or killers will change our resolve"- as if the
men who organized the bomb attacks in Istanbul hadn't wanted the U.S.
and Britain to invade Iraq, or did want them to leave now.

And the media lapped it all up, as if Bush and Blair were talking
sense and the suicide bombers were "mindless killers."

In the face of the torrent of deceitful propaganda, it has to be said
again and again. The invasion of Iraq had nothing to do with the "war
on terrorism." The only terrorism in Iraq is that which was caused by
the invasion.

The Islamist terrorists of Al Qaeda were delighted by the
Anglo-American invasion of Iraq. And the reason why there have been
so many successful terrorist attacks in Turkey, Morocco, Indonesia,
Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and elsewhere in recent months is
probably because of the diversion of intelligence efforts to the war
in Iraq.

One at a time: First, there was no more linkage between Saddam
Hussein's repressive but rigorously secular regime in Iraq and the
Islamist terrorists of Al Qaeda than there was between the mafia and
the Khmer Rouge. There is absolutely no evidence for it, and the
entire American and British intelligence establishments spent the
time before the invasion of Iraq desperately signalling to their
political masters (and later, off the record, to any media that would
listen) that there was no such link.

They were not listened to because Bush's people were determined to
have their war, and Blair- well, that's still puzzling.

But it is clear, if you watch how their lips move, that both men are
conscious of having practised a deception on the public. They
regularly mention Al Qaeda and Iraq in the same breath in order to
foster the illusion that there was a link, but they never actually
say it in exactly so many words. Like most politicians, they know
that you can fuzz, distort or evade the issue to your heart's
content, but you must never tell an outright lie.

The "terrorism" in Iraq these days bears little resemblance to the
almost metaphysical acts of existential hatred that struck New York
and Washington two years ago and the global strategy that lay behind
them.

Iraq is just the mundane, functional terrorism of anti-colonial
resistance from Algeria to Vietnam, carried out for the most part by
the same sort of people- ex-army officers, political ideologues,
young men with big chips on their shoulders- who would be doing the
same thing in the United States if foreign troops suddenly took over
the country. (You doubt me? Go rent Red Dawn out of the video store.)

The Iraqis who run this resistance movement doubtless use foreign
Islamist fanatics to drive the truck-bombs whenever possible- "if the
kid wants to die, let's give him the chance"- but there is no known
link between the war in Iraq and Al Qaeda's astonishingly ambitious
project to seize control of the Arab and even the broader Muslim
world. Which brings us, finally, to the question of how the invasion
of Iraq has undermined the real "war on terrorism."

Islamist terrorists really exist, although almost none of them are
Iraqis. They are not as numerous or rich or well-organized as the
propagandists would have us believe, and the damage they can do
doesn't begin to compare with what a real war does, but they are a
serious danger that warrants serious attention. Trouble is, they
haven't been getting it.

What matters most in a war against terrorism is intelligence.

There is a strictly limited mass of talent in Western intelligence
agencies which has the technical proficiency, the Arabic language
skills, and the personal attributes needed for the intelligence
gathering job- maybe as few as a couple of thousand key people. They
should be concentrating their efforts on Al Qaeda. For the past year,
most of them have been employed instead on some aspect of the project
for "liberating" Iraq (whatever that may mean)- and you can't be in
two places at once.

The Islamist terrorists who plotted the attacks on two Jewish
synagogues in Istanbul on Nov. 15 and on the HSBC headquarters and
the British consulate in the same city yesterday, killing 50 people
and injuring many hundreds, would have tried to do it whether Iraq
was invaded or not.

They didn't need excuses to attack. The difference is that if the
intelligence services had been paying attention to Al Qaeda instead
of barking up the wrong tree in Iraq, they might actually have been
stopped.

--de Griot Space - ONLINE WORKSHOPS

de Griot Space is a cyberspace collective of Afridiasporic writers and
readers who seek to improve their craft through study and interaction.
We are positive, patient and productive people. We are honest,
respectful and courageous. We are self-determined, supportive and
uncensored. We are artistic and political. We read and We write. We
struggle and We resolve. We bleed, laugh, cry, breathe, dance and
inspire words. We are lovers of our People. Visionaries. Forward moving.
Always.

de Griot Space is an online writing workshop virtually headquartered at
Black owned and operated Infobro.com, Inc. dGS was conceived in February
1997 with the keystrokes of a few forward thinking word artists and was
officially born on Black Nation Day, 31 March 32 ADM. We began committed
to the rich legacy of writing/storytelling/testimony given us by our
Afrikan and New Afrikan ancestors. We will never end. In our
collectivity as an Afridisporic community of writers, there is eternal
life.

This online writing workshop and community of writers has taken on the
name de Griot Space because of what we believed it to represent.
Traditionally, "the Griot", (pronounced gree'oh) embodies the culture of
his/her people. Included in a description of the term Griot includes
genealogist, historian, adviser, spokesperson, diplomat, mediator,
interpreter, translator, musician, composer, teacher, warrior, witness,
and praisesinger. It is almost as if an event cannot transpire unless a
Griot is there to witness it and absorb it. Whenever there is a call for
the voice, it is the Griot's voice that responds.


All People Black/Afrikan are qualified to join de Griot Space. The only
further requirement for joining is serious love of and commitment to the
word, and willingness to share the word. Your breath; your joys; your
sunshine; your busy kitchen; your aches and pains- bring all of these

share your poetry, or prose, de Griot Space may be the online workshop
for you.

--Grant: Philip Roth Residence in Creative Writing

Philip Roth Residence in Creative Writing
Stadler Center for Poetry

Named for the distinguished, Pulitzer Prize-winning Bucknell graduate,
the Philip Roth Residence in Creative Writing was initiated in the fall
of 1993. The Philip Roth Residence is intended to provide an emerging
writer, with some record of accomplishment, the opportunity to work for
up to four months in an atmosphere conducive to writing.

The residence provides lodging in Bucknell's Poet's Cottage, an office
in the Stadler Center for Poetry, and a modest stipend of $2,000. Meals
in the University Dining Service or an additional stipend for meals are
also provided. The position does not carry health insurance. In
alternate years, the residence is awarded to a fiction writer and poet.
In the past two years, including this one, the residence has taken place
during the spring semester of Bucknell's academic year. Normally, the
residence coincides with the fall semester of Bucknell's academic year
and will return to that schedule in 2004-05.

For the 2003-04 academic year, the residence will be awarded to a
fiction writer and will commence in mid-January 2004 and end in mid-May
2004. For the 2004-05 academic year, the residence will be awarded to a
poet and will commence in mid-August 2004 and end in mid-December 2004.

The Philip Roth Resident is expected to offer a public reading of his or
her work during the semester of residence. Although the person selected
will have no additional university responsibilities, it is hoped that he
or she will constitute a presence as a working writer on campus, talking
informally from time to time with students who are interested in
writing. The writer chosen may well use the residence to work on a first
or second book.

HOW TO APPLY

To be eligible, an applicant must be more than 21 years of age, must
reside
in the United States, and must not presently be enrolled as a student in
a college or university. Some record of publication is expected. To
apply, submit the following items by postal mail to the address shown
below:

1. A letter of application.
2. A resume or CV.
3. A writing sample of no more than 10 pages if applying for a poetry
residence, or 20 pages if applying for a fiction residence.
4. Two letters of recommendation.

Applicants who wish to have application materials returned should
include a
self-addressed, stamped envelope with enough postage to cover the return
of
their materials.

Application deadline (for 2004-05 Residence, open to a poet): postmarked
by Monday, March 15, 2004.

--Featured Show & DJ: “In Poetic Form,” hosted by AfroGirl

I keep my promises.  In the last newsletter, I promised all of you a new
DJ feature and here it is!  AfroGirl’s been with Vocalized Ink for a
minute now, but her show, “In Poetic Form,” is finally on the air.  I’ll
give you the days and times for the show at the end of this feature, but
for now, watch me get my Barbara Walters on with this little interview
of AfroGirl…

--note: forgive me for the different way I’m doing the feature (that is,
if you’ve been following my DJ features)…deadlines can be a b*tch sometimes…lol…enjoy!

Mensah Mkalimu (mm): What is your real name?

AfroGirl(AG): Renee

mm: Location & how long have you been there?

AG: California Bay Area, most of my life

mm: Occupation?

AG: Mother and poet, those are the important things.
mm: How long have you been writing and/or performing?

AG: Writing seriously for 3 years now. I used to write in high school
but stopped once I graduated because I didn't have anything depressing
to write about. I was one of those folks who could only write when I was
miserable. I've outgrown that now.

mm: What/who inspired you to become a poet?

AG: I pretty much inspired myself to do it. I wrote a poem one day about
3 years ago and rediscovered my talent for it and haven't put the pen
down since.


mm: Do you have a favorite topic to write about & why?

AG: I write about whatever moves me at a particular moment. I really
don't have a favorite topic. My least favorite topic to write about is
love. I cringe at the thought of writing a love poem.

mm: Who is your favorite poet?

AG: I have to say, at the moment Lucille Clifton. Her work is so concise
and to the point and full of elegance and poignancy.

mm: Do you perform at open mics? If so, then list a couple of venues.

AG: I've read at my local Barnes & Noble, and The Guild Theater in
Sacramento and a few other places around town.

mm: How did you get involved with Vocalized Ink?

AG: Poetically Breathless volunteered the both of us to do a show
together and I agreed. The partnership thing didn't work out due to
conflicting schedules but we're both here contributing, and I've been
having a great time.

mm: Talk a little bit about (right here, you can say whatever you want
about the show. I'll leave it to you to promote & explain it as much or
as little as you want).

AG: There are a couple of things I want to accomplish with In Poetic
Form. The first thing is to help people learn what makes good poetry and
the best way to do that is to feature people who are really excellent at
the craft and who truly understand it. The second thing is to provide a
forum where people can learn about poetry, the history of it, the forms
of it etc. Obviously I don't know it all but what I do know I want to
share and what I want to know I will learn and share.

mm: Do you have any books or CDs out right now? If so, where can people
purchase your product(s)?

AG: I have a book out called "Bearings" and it is available at my
website: wakeup.to/inpoeticform. There is also a link at
vocalizedink.org. I have no plans to do a CD.

        Dinde and drumsticks on Merci Donnant day
By Art Buchwald (IHT)
Thursday, November 28, 2002


If France had not voted with us in the United Nations on how we want to=20
deal with Iraq, I was going to refuse to reprint this column. Despite many=
=20
attempts to bring it up to date, the text remains the same as it first=20
appeared in the Plymouth Gazette in 1620.

One of the most important holidays is Thanksgiving Day, known in France as=
=20
le Jour de Merci Donnant.

Le Jour de Merci Donnant was started by a group of pilgrims (P=E8lerins) who=
=20
fled from l'Angleterre before the McCarran Act to found a colony in the New=
=20
World (le Nouveau Monde) where they could shoot Indians (les Peaux-Rouges)=
=20
and eat turkey (dinde) to their hearts' content. They landed at a place=20
called Plymouth (now a famous voiture Americaine) in a wooden sailing ship=
=20
named the Mayflower, or Fleur de Mai, in 1620. But while the P=E8lerins were=
=20
killing the dindes, the Peaux-Rouges were killing the P=E8lerins, and there=
=20
were several hard winters ahead for both of them.

The only way the Peaux- Rouges helped the P=E8lerins was when they taught=20
them how to grow corn (mais). The reason they did this was because they=20
liked corn with their P=E8lerins.

In 1623, after another harsh year, the P=E8lerins' crops were so good that=
=20
they decided to have a celebration and give thanks because more mais was=20
raised by the P=E8lerins than P=E8lerins were killed by the Peaux-Rouges.

Every year on le Jour de Merci Donnant, parents tell their children an=20
amusing story about the first celebration.

It concerns a brave capitaine named Miles Standish (known in France as=20
Kilom=E8tres Deboutish) and a shy young lieutenant named Jean Alden. Both of=
=20
them were in love with a flower of Plymouth named Priscilla Mullens (no=20
translation). The vieux capitaine said to the jeune lieutenant:

"Go to the damsel Priscilla (Allez tr=E8s vite chez Priscilla), the=
 loveliest=20
maiden of Plymouth (la plus jolie demoiselle de Plymouth). Say that a blunt=
=20
old captain, a man not of words but of action (un vieux Fanfan la Tulipe),=
=20
offers his hand and his heart - the hand and heart of a soldier. Not in=20
these words, you understand, but this, in short, is my meaning.

"I am a maker of war (Je suis un fabricant de la guerre) and not a maker of=
=20
phrases. You, bred as a scholar (Vous, qui =EAtes pain comme un =E9tudiant),=
=20
can say it in elegant language, such as you read in your books of the=20
pleadings and wooings of lovers, such as you think best suited to win the=20
heart of the maiden."

Although Jean was fit to be tied (convenable =E0 =EAtre emball=E9),=
 friendship=20
prevailed over love and he went to his duty. But instead of using elegant=20
language, he blurted out his mission. Priscilla was muted with amazement=20
and sorrow (rendue muette par l'=E9tonnement et la tristesse).

At length she exclaimed, breaking the ominous silence, "If the great=20
captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me, why does he not come=20
himself and take the trouble to woo me?" (Ou est-il, le vieux Kilom=E8tres?=
=20
Pourquoi ne vient-il pas aupr=E8s de moi pour tenter sa chance?)

Jean said that Kilom=E8tres Deboutish was very busy and didn't have time for=
=20
such things. He staggered on, telling her what a wonderful husband=20
Kilom=E8tres would make.

Finally, Priscilla arched her eyebrows and said in a tremulous voice, "Why=
=20
don't you speak for yourself, Jean?" (Chacun =E0 son gout.)

And so, on the fourth Thursday in November, American families sit down at a=
=20
large table brimming with tasty dishes and for the only time during the=20
year eat better than the French do.

No one can deny that le Jour de Merci Donnantis a grande f=EAte, and no=20
matter how well fed American families are, they never forget to give thanks=
=20
to Kilom=E8tres Deboutish, who made this great day possible.

I will appreciate references to any good articles and/or books on creative
revival strategies for bi-polar artists/writers coping with drug therapies
which - as intended - eliminate the creative drive previously induced during
manic episodes.
I have a young friend who's lost much inspiration, as well as the energy to
work creatively, since the start of the drug therapy. Inducing another kind
of depression and sadness.

Suggestions (b/c or public)  will be much appreciated.

Thanks,

Dear all: below is the first installment of what we're calling the "Buffalo =

Poetics Program Newsletter", representing our attempt to begin documenting=20
(with an eye toward archiving) the extraordinary range, extraordinary=20
output of activity here in Buffalo.  While eventually we would like to=20
include video and sound files, for now we have simply listed events that=20
are wholly or in part sponsored by the Poetics Program/Gray Chair, as well=20
as events that are organized by or that include students affiliated with=20
Poetics; we've also included student introductions to Tina Darragh, Rachel=20
Tzvia Back, Lytle Shaw, and Leslie Scalapino--the normally ephemeral but=20
always integral framing around the events.

Enjoy, and we'd be very happy to hear any comments or suggestions you might =

have!

All the best,
Lori Emerson and Kyle Schlesinger

Torn Space presents: Sarah Kane's "Blasted"
November 23, 2003
Adam Mickiewicz Polish Library
Blasted is a play about Ian, a middle-aged tabloid journalist who appears=20
to be dying and invites an unsuspecting simple-minded young woman, Cate,=20
into his Leeds luxury hotel room, assuring her that he simply needs a=20
little comfort during his final hours. Once trapped he proceeds to rape,=20
debase and ridicule her until an armed soldier suddenly bursts in and=20
wreaks appalling havoc, raping Ian and sucking out his eyeballs; the hotel=20
is bombed and we learn that savage fighting is taking place in the streets=20
of Leeds - there is more, of course, but I won't do you the disservice of a =

full synopsis.

The play opened in January 1995 (N.B., in the context of the war in the=20
former Yugoslavia) at the Royal Court Upstairs, becoming the theater's most =

controversial work in over thirty years. British newspaper critics were in=20
their element, describing it as "a disgusting feast of filth," a work=20
"devoid of intellectual and artistic merit" and like "having your whole=20
head held in a bucket of offal." However, established dramatists such as=20
Harold Pinter turned on the reviewers, telling them they were "out of their =

depth" and that Blasted was simply too complex for them. In addition to his =

public statements, Pinter wrote Kane a very serious letter of=20
congratulation. James Macdonald, the 1995 producer, noted that "a short run =

meant Blasted was seen by not many more than 1,000 people, making it=20
perhaps the least seen and most talked-about play in recent memory."

In 2001, Charles Spencer of the Telegraph remarked "When Sarah Kane's=20
Blasted opened at the tiny Royal Court Theatre Upstairs in January 1995, I=20
was convinced that it was meretricious rubbish produced by a young writer=20
with an adolescent desire to shock.... With its eyeball-munching, anal=20
rape, on-stage defecation and cannibalism, I suggested in a breathless=20
report to the news pages that Blasted was like a modern version of Titus=20
Andronicus, but patronizingly added that Kane couldn't write as well as=20
Shakespeare. Well, of course she couldn't.... Yet, seeing the play six=20
years on, there
is no doubt that it is an impressive, and serious, piece of work. I still=20
don't like it but I now admire it. Kane, who committed suicide in 1999, had =

genuine artistic vision and great dramatic talent."

Tina Darragh and Dan Farrell
Poetry Reading
Wed., Nov. 12, 4 pm; CFA Screening Room
Tina Darragh's most recent projects are "opposable dumbs", and a=20
collaboration with Marcella Durand "deep eco pre". She works as a reference =

librarian at Georgetown University. Dan Farrell=3Fs books include the =
Inkblot=20
Record (Coach House Press 2001) and Last Instance (Krupskaya 1999).

Procedural Introduction by Nathan Austin:
I begin my introduction of Tina Darragh by taking up the logic of her=20
procedures, by turning to the dictionary, which proves, perhaps not=20
surprisingly, silent. The blank place where her name should be held is=20
framed by the noun darning, which (Webster tells us) is =3Fthe act of=20
mending, as a hole in a garment,=3F and by the obsolete darrain, a verb of=20
uncertain origin and (again, according to Webster) equally uncertain=20
meaning. A definition to the right adds =3Fto erase at a stroke; to strike=20
out; to blot out or obliterate; as, to dash out a line or word.=3F

An absent name, the hole in a garment, the erased or blotted word, a word=20
too =3Funcertain=3F to fit comfortably within the boundaries of definition: =

where Darragh is =3Fdefined=3F in the dictionary by a blank surrounded by=20
blanks, the blank is for Darragh defined as a space for redefinition, for=20
the experience of language as an =3Factive and defective process=3F that =
opens=20
up the possibility of worlded activity, of insisting on =3Fthe right for=20
words to act as open forms=3F that move in a productive direction of=20
diversity, in the direction of order=3Fs disruption. =3FWe can relax with=20
randomness,=3F she writes, =3Fand know that depth is something we organize, =

without the need for a big picture, without the need to tie it all=20
together.=3F

This disorder, untied together, is =3Fpeculiar to or characteristic of=3F=20
Darragh=3Fs work=3Fit finds its form in words obliterated: fragments of =
words=20
that take on the possibility of doubled meanings, letters from which their=20
words have been taken away, words folded into fans, cut and pieced together =

with others. =3FI realize,=3F she writes,

I=3Fm not the one
who causes words
to lie apart
=3Fthey come that way=3F

But I=3Fm still obsessed by something in Webster=3Fs definition for his=20
uncertain word: the presence of the word =3Fbataille=3F within the =
bracketed=20
space of the etymological note. Though the word, quoted in a citation from=20
Chaucer, is an archaic form of the word battle, it is suggestive of the=20
French philosopher who wrote in his own =3FCritical Dictionary=3F that =3Fa =

dictionary would begin as of the moment when it no longer provided the=20
meanings of words but their tasks. In this way formless is not only an=20
adjective having such and such a meaning, but a term serving to declassify, =

requiring in general that every thing should have a form.=3F

To read Darragh=3Fs poetry after Bataille is to turn to the form of the=20
dictionaries she uses as generative sources, to find that definition itself =

operates by imposing form, by enclosing within boundaries, by limiting=20
meaning=3Fs possibility. In place of this closed form, Darragh proposes the =

chaotic and heterogenious form of the fractal, of the dictionary=3Fs page=20
read without boundaries, on which =3FThe lower oval ... is uniformly =
southern=20
in including a Greek island, 14 variations of lemon, money from Honduras=20
and Roman exorcisms.=3F

Where =3Fthe action begins by pointing overhead to cloth canopies, hard=20
shingles, common eagles and gods of light/mistletoe sprigs.=3F

Where =3FThe definition is surrounded by trees=3Ftulipwood, buckthorn, =
smoke,=20
birch, pine, osage orange, jessimine=3Fand suggests that we turn to the =
area=20
of =3Ffar and wide=3F and =3Ffaraway=3F for further clarification.=3F

This play is not without its purpose: =3FI experienced fractals as=20
political,=3F Darragh explains. =3FWhen we are branded as =
irregular/defective=20
within a Newtonian context, it is the first step toward our demise.=20
Classical concepts of order implicitly sanction this branding. To the=20
extent that fractals illuminate the limits and falsehoods of this canon,=20
they serve to undermine ideology generally.=3F

The story of Darragh=3Fs return to the dictionary, made formless and random =

through procedural reading, is thus its own =3Fstory of the Revolution,=3F =
a=20
possibility for action. And those of us who are poets should be thankful,=20
for she gives us something of a slogan: =3FIf poetry can be thought of has=20
having a role to play in our culture,=3F she writes, =3Fone aspect of the =
job=20
would be to make this random function -- as a process, as an organizing=20
agent -- visible, tactile, part of our sense of the world. We know we can=20
do it.=3F

Cinema as False Movement: Films of Repetition

"Accompaniment to a Cinematographic Scene" (1973, 16 min.) and "The=20
Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach" (1968, 94 min.).
Arnold Schoenberg's "Accompaniment to a Cinematographic Scene" combines=20
images of Schoenberg's self-portraits, excerpts of his letters to Kandinsky =

confronting anti-Semitism, a statement by Brecht on economics and fascism,=20
and images of B-52s bombing Southeast Asia to consider the dissonance=20
between music and politics while simultaneously reflecting on cinematic=20
time. "Straub and Huillet are working after the war; they know how the=20
threat has become catastrophe, horror. Their reflection traverses the=20
French colonial wars, Zionism and the Six Day War, May '68 and European=20
leftism; they confront violence, the traces of which are borne by their=20
German films." -- J. Aumont

The Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach is composed of images of documents=20
from Johann Sebastian Bach's life, musical performances in historic=20
locations, and a few fictionalized scenes, all of which are loosely held=20
together by a voice-over narration by his second wife, Anna Magdalena Bach. =

"The point of departure...was the idea of a film in which music would be=20
used -- not as accompaniment, nor as commentary -- but as raw material. We=20
also wanted to film a love story unlike any other: a woman talking about=20
her husband whom she loved unto his death." -- J.-M. Straub

Poetry Reading
4:00 pm Wednesday October 15, 2003
Center for the Arts
Introduction by Sasha Steensen
Rachel Back's Azimuth, published in 2001, begins with a long poem entitled=20
"Gravity and Grace." This poem takes its title from an essay by Simone Weil =

that begins: "All the natural movements of the soul are controlled by laws=20
analogous to those of physical gravity. Grace is the only exception." Backs =

poetry seeks the grace to resist the gravity that has been pressuring the=20
Middle Eastern landscape for centuries. Her work explores the tension=20
between a promised land and a land that promises pain indiscriminately,=20
that "devours its inhabitants." Ruins and borders punctuate her texts,=20
because these are the markers of this tension--"the land bore only scars/=20
bore no resemblance/ to lines on the map." Her poetry exists, to quote the=20
refrain of her poem "Litany," :between sand and prayer." It occupies the=20
shifting desert landscape, where there are brief moments of release from=20
this gravitational pressure: "A desert as fertile:/ floods with no=20
warning./ A place of extremes." A place of extremes is a place of=20
possibility, but we must heed Weil's imperative: "May that which is low in=20
us go downwards so that what is high can go upwards=3FTo re-establish order =

is to undo the creature in us. Reversal of the objective and subjective."=20
This reversal requires recognizing the other within ourselves. Back's poems =

struggle with this imperative: "I know/ I am also other/ than what I=20
imagine/ myself to be--"

These lines echo a key moment in Susan Howe's poem "Thorow." The speaker=20
notes, "you are of me & I of you,/ I cannot tell/ Where you leave off and I =

begin." In 2002, The University of Alabama Press published Back=3Fs book, =
Led=20
By Language: The Poetry and Poetics of Susan Howe, the first full-length=20
investigation of Howe's work. The concerns that Back identifies in Howe's=20
poetry are the concerns of her own project as well. Led By Language=20
examines, among other things, what Back refers to as Howe's=20
"autobiographically propelled historical project" and her "complex and=20
contradictory" relationship to place. Back writes, "History is, for Howe,=20
the site of the other," but history, for both Howe and Back, is accessed=20
through a deep connection to the landscape. Back begins her book on Howe=20
with a detailed investigation of the word "mark." Just as Howe charts the=20
marks left on the North American landscape, Back wanders through the=20
heavily marked landscape of Israel and Palestine. Back, taking her cue from =

Howe, "trusts the place to form the voice," which is why her poems are=20
multi-vocal. They present layers upon layers of exile, homelessness and=20
hardship.

Despite the marks that punctuate the landscapes of the Middle East, Back=20
resists the temptation to insist that she herself knows how to navigate=20
this space. Azimuth takes its title from the Arabic as-sumut, the plural of =

as-smat, meaning the way, "commonly relating to the course one pursues in=20
journeying." This pluralization suggests that there is no one way through=20
the embattled lands of Israel and Palestine. Her poems explore possible=20
paths through "a land without description." Back's own paths brought her=20
from Buffalo, where she was born and raised, to Israel, where she currently =

teaches English at Tel-Aviv University. In addition to Azimuth and Led By=20
Language, Back has recently released a chapbook entitled The Buffalo Poems. =

Her translations of Hebrew poetry into English have been published in=20
various collections, including the Feminist Press anthology The Defiant=20
Muse: Hebrew Feminist Poems From Antiquity to the Present. It is my=20
pleasure to welcome Rachel Back in her return to Buffalo.

Lytle Shaw
Poetry Reading
4:00 Wednesday October 1, 2003
Center for the Arts
Introduction by Michael Cross
I first came to the work of Lytle Shaw through his chapbooks "Principles of =

the Emeryville Shellmound," :A Side of Closure," and "Flexagon" (in=20
collaboration with the visual artist Emilie Clark). I was living in the Bay =

Area at the time, right near the Emeryville Shellmound, so I felt a=20
particular affinity for the site specificity of that work, as well as its=20
faux-scientific tone and cut and paste diagrams (a punk rock=20
do-it-yourself-style lineage that I still privilege). I wondered how much=20
of the "Emeryville Shellmound" could be true. Shaw writes, "In California,=20
coastal sea-life must be managed with special care. As a writer and an=20
amateur scientist, I was especially concerned with these issues. When I=20
discovered that the industrial building in which I have a studio rests on=20
the northeastern edge of the mound, I spent several weeks reconsidering my=20
writing's relation to the sedimented structures in my neighborhood. This=20
lead to a great deal of research and, eventually, the discoveries I=20
published some years ago..." This is followed by, "If you make keen=20
observations and keep accurate notes, you may produce worthwhile=20
contributions to science." Over this excerpted text are printed diagrams of =

scientists looking through archaic instruments and taking careful readings=20
of data generated from now useless technological monsters. I wondered if=20
Shaw really visited a Dr. Gamward, regional curator of the Western Maritime =

Library, or Cutter Stevens, "bait and tackle expert" at Hank Schramm=3Fs=20
Sportfishing Center. Did he consult Hickman and Roberts' Integrated=20
Principles of Zoology in order to "climb(ed) their illustrated cladograms,=20
separating, once again, bass, lizard, then mammary glanded horse and=20
monkey"? Once again?

Part of me wanted to believe it was so. That somewhere in the East Bay a=20
bookish poet/scientist was studying the biology of mollusks by day, and=20
returning home to study Diderot and Frank O=3FHara by candlelight. What a=20
life that would be! When I came into contact with Shaw's "A Side of=20
Closure" (an A+ Bend chapbook that was later collected in his ROOF edition=20
"The Lobe"), I developed a contradictory image in my mind of Shaw's poetic=20
identity. I was reading the book while finishing my Master's degree at=20
Mills College, often feeling totally overwhelmed and out of my league and=20
generally through with institutions of higher learning. Reading "A Side of=20
Closure," I remembered instantly what I loved about poetry and what I often =

found in Berrigan and O'Hara and other poets of the New York School, namely =

a deep respect for a body of scholarship, undercut by a biting irreverence. =

At times, when I found myself writing much too academic poetry (often by=20
force), I would flip through Shaw's book and simply look at the titles:=20
"Enter the Wagon," "Dude Looks Like the Portrait of a Lady," "Wheatsworth=20
and Cool Ranch," "Whoa, That was Brian Eno!," and finally "Some Failed=20
18th-Century Jacket Blurbs," which features the following: "When I oversaw=20
the Physicians drain three quarts of liquid from Samuel Johnson=3Fs =
testicle,=20
I felt certain to have seen the last of this troubling fluid."

Much later I was lucky enough to see Shaw give a talk with Juliana Spahr in =

Berkeley, and I was again struck by his dedication to epistemology and the=20
sheer breadth of his scholarship. I see in Shaw a sort of dynamic dichotomy =

that is itself reflected in his own book blurbs, though here you'll find=20
nothing akin to Johnson's "troubling fluid." Lyn Hejinian writes about "The =

Lobe," "...it is about the fissures that form the known, the fissures that=20
form knowers and that leave them (us) dangling in the wind." This is=20
followed by Anselm Berrigan's "Humor bypasses context, like when I felt=20
marginalized in gym class..." In Shaw I see a scientist of sorts, deeply=20
rooted in a scholarship privileging investigation and the fetish of minutia =

and esotericism; conversely, I see in Shaw a New New York, longing for the=20
days of pills and walks, and making of that material something vibrant and=20
funny and in the words of Brian Kim Stefans, something "Oprah would hate."=20
Ladies and Gentlemen, please help in welcoming Lytle Shaw...

ELEVATOR: The Grid Project
Opening and Reading
Sat. Sept. 27th 8:00 pm
Just Buffalo's Hibiscus Room
Featuring readings by participants in and out of the poetics program and=20
artist books by Amy Stalling. ELEVATOR is pleased to present the fourth=20
installment in our artist's book collaboration series: THE GRID PROJECT.=20
THE GRID PROJECT is an international, inter-linguistic, inter-textual=20
writing project involving the collaboration and contribution of artist Amy=20
stalling and more than thirty-poets from North America, Europe and Japan.=20
THE GRID PROJECT is comprised of 40 artist's books produced by Amy=20
Stalling, each containing four grids, and one hundred printed paper books=20
containing all of the grids.

Each artist's books is made from wood, copper, steel and paint and contains =

a unique Word Interaction Device (WID) produced by the artist. The WID=20
resembles an abacus consisting of four wires strung the length of the book=20
which hold wooden cubes in the form of a grid 4 cubes wide by 9 cubes long. =

Each WID is unique in that it recombines the textual grids of four poems=20
from the collection; four being the number of usable text-faces per cube=20
(the other two, because pierced by wire, do not contain text).

Participants were sent grids and instructed to used no more than one word=20
per cube face. They were also told that grids would be reformatted using a=20
twelve point standard typed such as Times New Roman. Fortunately, many=20
writers did not stick to this format and sent us work in many varied=20
formats, ranging from handwritten grids to gridless poems to full color=20
visual works. Upon seeing the wide range of submissions, we decided to go=20

Leslie Scalapino
Poetry Reading: Wed. Sept. 24th 4pm
Center for the Arts
Talk: Wed. Sept. 24 12:30 pm
438 Clemens Hall
Introduction by Sarah Campbell
Anybody wants to be a traveler; nobody wants to be a tourist. Although I'm=20
speaking of a certain kind of American, I'm also talking about a dilemma=20
for writing. Leslie Scalapino's writing travels this course and transports=20
us to what happens as soon as you leave home, and get going, seeing=20
countries and moving through crowds. Scalapino's lines work at the=20
traveler's predicament--for the touring person is never just being, she is=20
either becoming or unbecoming, going somewhere or returning, never quite=20
there, "not quite that," -- a recurring phrase in Scalapino's book-length=20
poem, Crowd and not evening or light. To encounter Scalapino's poetry and=20
fiction is to experience, really, what is best about a traveler's=20
displacements and is something similar to what the tourist feels when she=20
meets a new ordering of things: immense gratitude for even the simplest=20
exchanges, astonishment at the unrolling of everyday events, and the=20
appreciative drive to see more, hear more, to keep moving. Scalapino's=20
writing is being that. Meanwhile, the world you're reading through her=20
work, like the world through a camera lens or out the train window is=20
continuously changing.

Lyn Hejinian tells this story about Scalapino traveling with her husband=20
and parents in Mongolia. Hejinian writes, "They were in two jeeps crossing=20
the Gobi Desert, which is largely without roads. Leslie was seated . . .=20
with her notebook and a pen, intending to write as they went along, but=20
whenever she began to write the driver of the jeep, a Mongolian man from=20
the area, would bring the jeep to a stop. "I realized that we'd never get=20
anywhere, and that was a problem," she said, referring not only to their=20
literal journey but also to the writing, since she is adamant that her=20
writing not function as a snatcher, that it not immobilize anything. It=20
must participate in the outrunning."

In its movements, Scalapino's poetry can create for a reader the effect of=20
one of its own lines: the fantastic floating, racing feeling of being=20
"dropped - from a helicopter and hit the ground running - as the /=20
description." So that, for instance, the dashes of Scalapino's lines are=20
holes everywhere punched so that what might be the subject of the utterance =

might not be as well--the line is opening, we can drop into it.

The scope of Scalapino's writing is phenomenal, in all senses of the word.=20
Its inventions are unforeseen. Her many books range over poetry, essays,=20
plays, and fiction and include the novel Defoe, and the 1999 collections,=20
New Time and The Public World/Syntactically Impermanence. This year,=20
Wesleyan University Press published the two-part book, Zither &=20
Autobiography. Zither is, among other things, what Scalapino describes as=20
"samurai film as Classic Comic of Shakespeare's King Lear (without using=20
any of Shakespeare's language, characters or plot)." In it, we find lines=20
that leap like these,

"woman looks like cheetah-her eyes
from one being within train-jumps-one-is

The sense of "no matter what" is important"; . . . "

The White Bear and Other Unwanted Thoughts
Friday September 19 5:30 - midnight
Opening of CEPA Gallery
The Brown Bear, settling down for its winter sleep, reminds itself to never =

think of The White Bear. As its heart slows to eight beats a minute, The=20
Brown Bear finds it can think of nothing else. The White Bear, the unwanted =

thought, haunts The Brown Bear's day and night dreams. Two bears hibernate=20
in CEPA's window gallery on Main Street. As they sleep, images of distinct=20
landscapes reflect in the window glass. In these vast expanses a=20
reoccurring narrative is played out. The Brown Bear is either trying to=20
escape the presence of the ghost bear or to search for proof of its=20
existence. Peepholes offer views into the dreams of these winter sleepers.

In this non-linear adventure where nothing much happens, Lewin and Odell=20
don realistic looking bear costumes. Their human faces show to remind the=20
viewer they are not "all" or "pure" bear. They, much like the Kermode Bear=20
(a black bear with a white coat), are an example of an evolutionary twist,=20
or a de-evolutionary regression caught in the middle of being themselves=20
and something other.

Robert Creeley
Publication of If I Were Were Writing This
The poems of If I Were Writing This, Robert Creeley's first major=20
collection since the highly praised Life & Death (1998), have an "aching=20
sweetness" that speak to the preciousness of life as the poet both faces=20
his own mortality and simultaneously looks on a world suddenly more=20
precarious and fragile. In these poems there is longing, a twinge of regret =

sometimes, a bit of nostalgia, the sadness of passing time, but finally no=20
regrets and no self-pity, just an understanding that this is what it is to=20
be human, an acknowledgement that life is uncertain but also bracing and=20
positive.

Creeley himself comments: "Given the bleak vulnerability of the world and=20
of our own country's dogmatic commitment to violence, what can either poet=20
or poetry do? For one thing, insist on feeling - insist on witness - insist =

on being here, in this 'phenomenal world,' as Lawrence called it, 'which is =

raging and yet apart.' Age brings experience, not wisdom; age makes time=20
actual - each day another - until there is no more. These poems have been=20
my company, my solace, my feelings, my heart. When they cannot speak, it=20
will all be silence."

About a Turkey
By PATRICK MARTINS
=A0
When you sit down to your Thanksgiving meal on Thursday, waiting for=20
the main attraction to be brought in on a platter, take a moment to=20
think about where it came from and how it found its way to your table.=20=

After all, your turkey is not the same wily, energetic, tasty bird that=20=

struck our ancestors as the perfect centerpiece for an American holiday.

Most Americans know that the turkey is a native game bird, and that=20
Benjamin Franklin thought it would have been a better national symbol=20
than the bald eagle. For good reason: in the wild, Meleagris gallopavo=20=

is a fast runner and a notoriously difficult prize for hunters. Even=20
after they were domesticated, turkeys remained spirited, traditionally=20=

spending the bulk of their lives outdoors, exploring, climbing trees,=20
socializing and, of course, breeding.

Now consider the bird that will soon be on your plate. It probably=20
hatched in an incubator on a huge farm, most likely in the Midwest or=20
the South. Its life went downhill from there. A few days after hatching=20=

- in the first of many unnatural if not necessarily painful indignities=20=

- it had its upper beak and toenails snipped off. A turkey is normally=20=

a very discriminating eater (left to its own devices, it will search=20
out the exact food it wants to eat). In order to fatten it up quickly,=20=

farmers clip the beak, transforming it into a kind of shovel. With its=20=

altered beak, it can no longer pick and choose what it will eat.=20
Instead, it will do nothing but gorge on the highly fortified=20
corn-based mash that it is offered, even though that is far removed=20
from the varied diet of insects, grass and seeds turkeys prefer. And=20
the toenails? They're removed so that they won't do harm later on: in=20
the crowded conditions of industrial production, mature turkeys are=20
prone to picking at the feathers of their neighbors - and even=20
cannibalizing them.

After their beaks are clipped, mass- produced turkeys spend the first=20
three weeks of their lives confined with hundreds of other birds in=20
what is known as a brooder, a heated room where they are kept warm, dry=20=

and safe from disease and predators. The next rite of passage comes in=20=

the fourth week, when turkeys reach puberty and grow feathers. For=20
centuries, it was at this point that a domesticated turkey would move=20
outdoors for the rest of its life.

But with the arrival of factory turkey farming in the 1960's, all that=20=

changed. Factory-farm turkeys don't even see the outdoors. Instead, as=20=

many as 10,000 turkeys that hatched at the same time are herded from=20
brooders into a giant barn. These barns generally are windowless, but=20
are illuminated by bright lights 24 hours a day, keeping the turkeys=20
awake and eating.

These turkey are destined to spend their lives not on grass but on wood=20=

shavings, laid down to absorb the overwhelming amount of waste that the=20=

flock produces. Still, the ammonia fumes rising from the floor are=20
enough to burn the eyes, even at those operations where the top level=20
of the shavings is occasionally scraped away during the flock's time in=20=

the barn.

Not only do these turkeys have no room to move around in the barn, they=20=

don't have any way to indulge their instinct to roost (clutching onto=20
something with their claws when they sleep). Instead, the turkeys are=20
forced to rest in an unnatural position - analogous to what sleeping=20
sitting up is for humans.

Not only are the turkeys in the barn all the same age, they - and the=20
roughly 270 million turkeys raised on factory farms each year - are all=20=

the same variety, the appropriately named Broad Breasted White. Every=20
bit of natural instinct and intelligence has been bred out of these=20
turkeys, so much so that they are famously stupid (to the point where=20
farmers joke they'll drown themselves by looking up at the rain). Broad=20=

Breasted Whites have been developed for a single trait at the expense=20
of all others: producing disproportionately large amounts of white meat=20=

in as little time as possible.

Industrial turkeys pay a high price for the desire of producers and=20
consumers for lots of white breast meat. By their eighth week, these=20
turkeys are severely overweight. Their breasts are so large that they=20
are unable to walk or even have sex. (All industrial turkeys today are=20=

the product of artificial insemination.)

Needless to say, no Broad Breasted White could hope to survive in=20
nature. These turkeys' immune systems are weak from the start, and to=20
prevent even the mildest pathogen from killing them, farmers add large=20=

amounts of antibiotics to their feed. The antibiotics also help the=20
turkeys grow faster and prevent ailments like diabetes, respiratory=20
problems, heart disease and joint pains that result from an unvaried=20
diet and lack of exercise. Because the health of these turkeys is so=20
delicate, the few humans who come in contact with them generally wear=20
masks for fear of infecting them.

On non-industrial farms, it takes turkeys 24 weeks to arrive at=20
slaughter weight, about 15 pounds for a hen and 24 pounds for a tom.=20
Industrial turkeys, however, need half that time. By 12 to 14 weeks,=20
the whole flock is ready for the slaughterhouse. Once slaughtered, the=20=

turkeys have to suffer one more indignity before arriving in your=20
grocer's meat case. Because of their monotonous diet, their flesh is so=20=

bland that processors inject them with saline solution and vegetable=20
oils, improving "mouthfeel" while at the same time increasing shelf=20
life and adding weight.

Anyone who cooks knows that salt alone won't do the trick. Once, simply=20=

sticking a turkey in the oven for a few hours was enough. Today, chefs=20=

have to go to heroic lengths to try to counteract the turkey's=20
cracker-like dryness and lack of flavor. Cooks must brine, marinate,=20
deep fry, and hide the taste with maple syrup, herbs, spices, butter=20
and olive oil. It's no surprise that side dishes have moved to the=20
center of the Thanksgiving menu.

Even so, 45 million turkeys will be sold this Thanksgiving, so turkey=20
producers aren't doing badly for themselves. But could they be sowing=20
the seeds of their own misfortune? By relying solely on a single strain=20=

of the Broad Breasted White, and producing it in huge vertically=20
integrated companies that control every aspect of production, entire=20
flocks and even the species itself is one novel pathogen away from=20
being wiped off the American dinner table. The future of the turkey as=20=

we know it rests on only one genetic strain. And the fewer genetic=20
strains of an animal that exist, the less chance that the genes=20
necessary to resist a lethal pathogen are present.

It's for this reason that maintaining genetic diversity within any=20
species is crucial to a secure and sustainable food supply. Sadly for=20
the turkey and for us, the rise of the Broad Breasted White means that=20=

dozens of other turkey varieties, including the Bourbon Red,=20
Narragansett and Jersey Buff, have been pushed to the brink of=20
extinction because there is no longer a market for them.

What to do? One solution is to bypass Broad Breasted Whites altogether.=20=

A few nonprofit groups - including my own, Slow Food U.S.A., and the=20
American Livestock Breeds Conservancy - are working with independent=20
family farms to ensure that a handful of older, pre-industrial turkey=20
varieties, known as heritage breeds, are still being grown. These=20
varieties are slowly gaining recognition for their dark, rich and=20
succulent meat. (My group, which encourages the preservation of=20
artisanal foods, sells turkeys on behalf of these farmers, but we don't=20=

profit from the transactions.)

While it might be too late to get your hands on a heritage bird this=20
year, there are some other options available to consumers who would=20
like a turkey raised in a more humane fashion, even if it is a Broad=20
Breasted White. Farmers' markets often have meat purveyors who raise=20
their turkeys the way they should be, free ranging and outdoors.

At the market, you can often meet the person who grew your turkey and=20
ask about how it was raised. Many independent butcher shops have=20
developed relationships with local farmers who deliver fresh turkeys,=20
especially for special occasions like Thanksgiving. A few=20
environmentally conscious supermarkets get their turkeys from small=20
family farms.

But as you shop, you need to look for more than just labels like=20
"organic," "free range" and "naturally raised." They have been co-opted=20=

by big business and are no guarantee of a healthier and more humanely=20
raised bird.

The key word to keep in mind is "traceability." If the person behind=20
the counter where you buy your turkey can name the farm or farmer who=20
raised it, you are taking a step in the right direction. You'll help=20
give turkeys a better life. You'll be kinder to the environment. And=20
you might even wind up with a turkey that tastes, well, like a turkey.

actually, if you are the owner of a pet bird (I am, and more poets I
know have pet birds than, say, engineers I know have pet birds) in
Texas, the American Southwest, or California, you know that Newcastle,
which spreads among factory-farmed poultry (predicted in the slow food
article) is already spreading and killing millions of birds;
scandalously, government workers have put thousands of pet birds to
death, oftentimes in front of their owners

owners of pet birds are encouraged not to subscribe to bird magazines,
etc. so that no one who is not a friend or family member knows there are
pet birds in the house; many vets encourage bird owners to get
(unnecessary) vaccination against Newcastle so that if fish & game comes
to your house to kill your pet, you have documentation to present to
them...

Hi All--Can anyone point me to the Eliot essay where he says that bit
about modern poetry having to include (or was it compete with?) the sound
of automobile horns?

I have heard this from two friends who were in miami, and this was forwarded
by a friend. Has anyone on the list heard about this? I am still rather
uncertain what to think, but I know that this group (APOC)was harrassed in
NYC within the past two months, and that they gained attention following a
conference they held in Detroit. If it is true, they folks definitely need
to know about what is happening.
Following link is a story about the Apoc conference.

miekal,
thank you for posting this!  i hadn't seen the article and the fact that it is not hysterically vegetarian (like me) will probably sway more people than most of the stuff i send around.  (i'm sending it around.)

murder was in the air... let bygones be bygones... it was all right by me...
this delicate razor is a nest of portents... we'd never been able to sell
it... there he comes, the gentleman with lemon-colored gloves.. I didn't say
yes... like he'd almost stopped doing... our pantomime sent him into
stitches... I stopped resisting... we went into all the details... I looked
him over carefully... he was recovering his color... she kept on writing
me... I won't have any trouble... a landslide of blueprints and diagrams...
about Mars he could talk at length... said he'd snap it up for a song...
anonymous letters that were no joke... I finally had to give in... it was
all right by me... aw, it's an awful thing... maybe I'd never see Mars
again... I went back twice... they wanted to take my picture... oh, the
shame of it... I'm not angry anymore... I liked it fine... was in a
torpor... he'd gone far enough... we had plenty of takers...
we'd better hadn't... we lay sprawled for days... he's not the old high and
mighty... the kind of stories you hear about... I went back twice... we even
exaggerated if that were possible... I could never count on her... a sea of
molasses... spherical balloons weren't wanted... a word to the wise...
she thought I was trying to sell her a bill of goods... he'd written three
manuals and a whole string of articles (with eighty diagrams)... said the
Universe is master of its own house... at first sight he seemed reasonable
enough... I didn't deserve their great kindness... more and more of them
kept coming...
his arm rises and falls... was giving me a song and dance... wait till you
see the view... the hearth crumbled into the soup... we holed up behind the
blinds... no pettifoggery... emeralds of inconceivable splendor... we hadn't
been kidding... they must be around here somewhere... we all slept in
straw...
he'd heard us talking... she really looked sick... doubt is that gentleman's
middle name... anyway, I'd give it a try... used puns to distract
attention... it'll die down in a week or ten days... he couldn't believe his
ears... they bore us no grudge at all... just by hints and snatches... the
rest had fainted...
they motioned us to follow them... nocturnal marauding... they run like
zebras... he wouldn't be able to do that... there wasn't a moment to be
lost... martyrs forever... the Moon... cash on the line...
here we go again... he was quick, though... we had to take him with us...
the whole veni vidi vici thing... Venusian gallops... he had his outline all
ready... there's the question of surety... he's the murderer... and off
again on tiptoes... I got a kick square in the stomach... but I didn't say
boo...
at least a page written on every one that passed... let me attend to my

absolutely impervious... I won't even mention the diving bell...

How does he intend to get machines lucid dreaming?
I am one who believes that machines can only be intelligent agents, the
smarter they get the smarter the person who made them becomes. Machines can
not surpass humans in intelligence only add to human intelligence because
humans are not just a collection of feedback mechanisms. A software poetry
machine is limited immediately by vocabulary, even if it is being added to
and even if there is a random function, the vocabulary is a fixed item and
the product will become predictable eventually.

|||PATENTS
|||The Muse Is in the Software
|||By TERESA RIORDAN
|||
|||"INVENTING is about catching the wave," said Ray Kurzweil, who addressed
|||a national convention of inventors in Philadelphia last Monday. "Most
|||inventions fail not because the inventor can't get them to work but
|||because the invention comes at the wrong time."
|||
|||Mr. Kurzweil should know. An inventor in the field of artificial
|||intelligence, he has started and sold several companies for millions of
|||dollars.
|||
|||On Nov. 11, Mr. Kurzweil and John Keklak, an engineer, received patent
|||No. 6,647,395, covering what Mr. Kurzweil calls a cybernetic poet.
|||Essentially, it is software that allows a computer to create poetry by
|||imitating but not plagiarizing the styles and vocabularies of human
|||poets.
|||
|||It works something like a cyberblender. The poetically challenged (or
|||those with temporary writer's block) can toss in rhymes and rhythms and
|||alliterations from already written poems. These whir around a bit, then
|||out pours a new poem.
|||
|||Here is a poem the cybernetic poet wrote after "reading" poems by Wendy
|||Dennis, a poet employed by Mr. Kurzweil:
|||
|||Sashay down the page
|||
|||through the lioness
|||
|||nestled in my soul.
|||
|||While other poetry-generating software exists, Mr. Kurzweil said, it is
|||less sophisticated.
|||
|||"Those are fixed, fill-in-the-blank approaches that resemble the Mad
|||Libs game," he said. "They are not really trying to create new patterns
|||based on a more flexible pattern structure."
|||
|||Many of Mr. Kurzweil's inventions, including the cybernetic poet, are
|||based on pattern recognition. "The real power of human thinking is based
|||on recognizing patterns," he said. The better computers get at pattern
|||recognition, the more humanlike they will become.
|||
|||Mr. Kurzweil said he knew he wanted to be an inventor from the age of 5.
|||By the time he was 16, he had invented a computer that composed melodies
|||based on pattern recognition. He and his melody-generating machine
|||appeared on the television show "I've Got a Secret."
|||
|||By the age of 28, he had invented a print-to-speech reading machine for
|||the blind that caught the attention of the composer and performer Stevie
|||Wonder.
|||
|||Mr. Kurzweil's talk in Philadelphia was a significant change of pace for
|||last week's two-day conference, sponsored by the United States Patent
|||and Trademark Office. Other speakers covered the nitty-gritty of "claim
|||construction" and "prior art" while Mr. Kurzweil mused about the brave
|||new world of technology.
|||
|||Were he not such a successful entrepreneur, Mr. Kurzweil might be
|||considered something of a crackpot. In his book "The Age of Spiritual
|||Machines'' (Penguin, 2000), he envisions a world in the near future
|||where computers superannuate humans - they compose music and poetry,
|||have sex with each other, and achieve a humanlike consciousness.
|||
|||"We will cross the threshold where we have hybrid or nonbiological
|||humans," Mr. Kurzweil said in a phone interview last week. "Our
|||biological thinking is fixed. But our nonbiological thinking" - by which
|||he means machine intelligence - "will grow exponentially."
|||
|||Mr. Kurzweil roams from the philosophical to the practical. During his
|||talk in Philadelphia, he offered practical tips on how inventors can
|||harness their ideas.
|||
|||He advocates what he calls lucid dreaming - harnessing the unconscious
|||to work on problems while sleeping.
|||
|||"When I go to sleep I assign myself a problem, without trying to solve
|||the problem," he said. Then during his waking moments, between
|||consciousness and slumber, he revisits the problem. "It is a great time
|||for creative thinking," he said. "You can think of new connections, new
|||approaches that you wouldn't otherwise think of."
|||
|||So does Mr. Kurzweil predict that his cybernetic poet will "catch the
|||wave"?
|||
|||"This is a useful aid to real-life poets looking for inspiration or for
|||help with alliteration or rhyming," he said. "But I am not intending for
|||it to be a huge money maker."
|||
|||A version of the cybernetic poet can be downloaded free from
|||www.kurzweilcyberart.com. The deluxe version is $29.95.
|||
|||
|||Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be ordered
|||through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent and Trademark
|||Office, Washington, D.C. 20231

I may be overstating the case,

Bi-polar is often a construct by the psychopharmaco---industry

I agree completely-- the goal is to drug up everyone and take away art. I
use myself as an example I was part of one of the first study groups of kids
with ADD, they of course put me on strong drugs-- sure I could do math then
but I was uncreative and my personality was not what I wanted, now at 36 I
have come to some kind of creative/practical equilibrium-- Now as a creative
person who also works in business I must tell you that creative and control
is the real issue

as someone who's been manic-depressive their entire life, i can't disagree
more strenuously with chris and haas. i never needed any psychologist,
psychiatrist, psychotherapist, or social worker to tell me i was
manic-depressive, it was a fairly easy self diagnosis. hell, a good chunk of
poets i've known, to whatever degree of intimacy over the past 12 years,
could simply trace the trajectory of my output, as an editor and a poet, and
know whether i was in a manic phase or a depressive one.

all the mental health workers i've seen over the years would mention meds,
but none of them ever attempted to medicate me for the sake of medicating
me. it wasn't until i realized that i needed to at least give meds a shot
that i was prescribed them.

and as far as being creative while on the meds, all i can say if i've lost
my manic highs, which were always followed by severe lows. But i'm still
being creative, and pretty productive--as a writer i've been doing a couple
of different daily writing projects the last two months, and before that
doing a blog for about three months; as an editor, i restarted my dormant
press and have been publishing monthly issues of our paper and our first
chapbook in a coupla years, put on a bunch of successful events, and started
a new monthly reading series. if all this is me losing my creative control,
please, let me lose it some more.

I for one was not talking about depression, that is another thing all
together but I do have doubts about over medicating people with lesser
conditions that might result in drug dependance that may have been overcome
in other ways in years past.
But clinical depression is another issue all together

I thought this kind of stigmatizing of those with diagnosable chronic
disabilities went out with the turn of the century.  It's typical of the
dark ages of the Twentieth Century.  Wake up, it's 2003 now.

Thanks, mIEKAL, for sending the article about turkeys.  I was asking my
mother the other day about goose.  Let's have a goose this year, I said, why not.
Goose! she said.  She got tired of eating goose for Thanksgiving as a child,
before turkeys were generally available.  Every year, her aunt from Mayville,
WI, would send a goose to my mother and her parents in Lakewood, WI, further
north.  The goose is smaller and fattier (a dangerous word to her now), darker
-- I like fattier, dark turkey meat best, so a whole goose of it would be even
better, I said.  Then, in the 1930s and 1940s, turkeys were not farm-raised
and the average wild turkey was too large for one family.  Turkey wins again
this year (despite my protests), but it will be kosher/organic.

Re: Ron ('s article) on the Kurzweil poetry
software,---


I bought that software about two years ago (on New
Year's Eve), and found it disappointing and have used
it very minimally ever since.

The best thing about it is that it'll automatically
give you Blake or Keats vocabulary (or other fun
pre-set classics: Shelley, Tennyson, Virgil [the
Virgil/Vergil poem I posted to the List at around that
time was done using Cybernetic Poet as a
quasi-flarf-ifier, . . . so, I ~have~ sinned; I have
automated]), their rhymes, alliterations, and
next-word-used for words you input, . . . if you're
into that sort of Masterpiece Theater anachronism.

My hope was to use Kurzweil's Cybernetic Poet to
"re-create" an unprogrammed poet from his/her own
vocabulary ---in specific, that was when I was trying
to "channel" Laura Riding Jackson into
as-yet-unwritten posthumous poems,--- but I found that
it leaves clumps of the original syntax intact in a
way that I found unacceptably cut-&-paste.  (A finicky
consumer.)  Wendy Dennis, whom the article refers to
and who was their tech support person, told me there
was no way around that and that the smallest "bites"
it'd take from the poets' vocabularies was, like, 4
words or so.

I want a software/~dea ex machina~ that'll ~parse~ a
poet's vocabulary into its parts of speech and then
deploy that into the poet's own idiolectical deep
grammar.  In her final book of poetry, for example
(the half-French, woodcut-illustrated one was the one
that interested me), Laura Riding Jackson rarely used
a noun except in an adjective-noun combination; and it
was statistical idiosyncracies of grammar+vocabulary
like those that I felt (feel) make up the essence of
what a "poet"/"author" is (the titular unifying code
behind an agglomeration of texts).

The software might work better for someone with less
targeted intentions than what I wanted from it.

Happy Thanksgiving.

J.J.

Dear Lori and Kyle,

thanks, for posting the newsletter up on the list. I was trying to think how
it might become most useful as a document for someone such as myself taking
a close interest, although from a distance.

Asides from the range of events, striking in itself, I liked the inclusion
of the introductions to a number of them. That seems worth encouraging and
even extending, much as I often take pleasure in the introductions that
Lawrence Upton makes to readers at the London SubVoicive series.

I wondered if that inclusion of more discursive materials might not become
extended, when appropriate, to reports / responses generated by those
presentations in a slightly more formal way than pub and corridor and
internal e-list chat affords. It could become an onus I know and there is
the attendant problem that the most intriguing is often the more difficult
to make cogent responses to. Responses NEED not be fully formed and that
would have it's own fascinating ecology. But there's nothing like jotting
down some articulation of those necessary closures that seemingly ephemeral
events occasion. Responses could be to all aspects of such occurrences of
course. I remember taking huge delight in Kevin Killian's delicious
conference reports, at least some of which concentrated on
witness-participant apparel. It's frustrating, for me, to have so much
concentration upon the official information and so little, as yet, on the
work presented. Maybe that's already part of your ongoing intention.

You know I want to hear about how Anya and Lara's piece went? What did
Rachel Blau DuPlessis talk about? These aren't questions to you, so much as
the longings of one who couldn't be 'there'.

So I'm looking forwards to future issues including image and sound files a
lot. Although I guess you're thinking that might become a feature of the
blog? And documentation raises other questions, worth addressing.

love and love
cris

Hugh Kenner, Commentator on Literary Modernism, Dies at 80
By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

Hugh Kenner, the critic, author and professor of literature regarded as
America's foremost commentator on literary modernism, especially the
work of Ezra Pound and James Joyce, died yesterday at his home in
Athens, Ga. He was 80.

He had been suffering from heart problems, his wife, Mary Anne Kenner,
said.

The variety of Mr. Kenner's interests was contained in 25 books of his
own (he contributed to 200 more) and nearly 1,000 articles, as well as
broadcasts and recordings. He wrote commandingly on everything from
Irish poetry to geodesic math and Li'l Abner's pappy (Lucifer Ornamental
Yokum), to the Heath/Zenith Z-100 computer (one of which he built for
himself and then wrote the user's guide) and the animated cartoons of
Chuck Jones.

But it was for his pioneering guide to English-language literary
modernism and for his books "Dublin's Joyce" (1956), "The Pound Era"
(1971) and "Joyce's Voices" (1978) that Mr. Kenner was best known. In
these works and others he employed the techniques proposed by the
writers themselves to define new standards by which to judge their work.

In "The Pound Era," perhaps his masterwork, he tried to show how the
American expatriate poet absorbed the altered sense of time created by
Einstein's revolution and helped to pass it on to artists like Joyce,
Wyndham Lewis, Eliot, William Carlos Williams and the sculptor Henri
Gaudier-Brzeska.

While some faulted Mr. Kenner for attributing to Pound too much
prominence in the scheme of modern art, no one failed to be impressed by
the vigor and importance of Mr. Kenner's analysis.

In a 1988 review of "A Sinking Island: The Modern English Writers," the
critic Richard Eder wrote in The Los Angeles Times: "Kenner doesn't
write about literature; he jumps in, armed and thrashing. He crashes it,
like a party-goer who refuses to hover near the door but goes right up
to the guest of honor, plumps himself down, sniffs at the guest's
dinner, eats some and begins a one-to-one discussion. You could not say
whether his talking or his listening is done with greater intensity."

William Hugh Kenner was born in Peterborough, Ontario, on Jan. 7, 1923,
the son of Henry Rowe Hocking Kenner, the principal, instructor of Latin
and Greek and baseball coach of Peterborough Collegiate and Vocational
Institute (now School), and Mary Isabel (Williams) Kenner, a classics
teacher. After graduating from the Peterborough institute, he attended
the University of Toronto, where he studied under Marshall McLuhan,
taking his bachelor's in 1945 and master's in 1946, with a gold medal in
English. He had difficulty deciding whether to study English or
mathematics and opted for English because he said he would have been
"only a competent mathematician," his son Robert said in an interview
yesterday.

In 1947 he married Mary Josephine Waite, a librarian, who died in 1964.
They had five children, Catherine, Julia, Margaret, John and Michael. In
1965 he married Mary Anne Bittner, an instructor in nursing at the
University of Virginia. This marriage produced two children, Robert and
Elizabeth. All seven children survive him, along with 12 grandchildren.
Also in 1947, his first book, "Paradox in Chesterton," was published in
England, with an introduction by McLuhan, who insisted that the author
take a doctorate.

In 1950 Mr. Kenner completed his Ph.D. at Yale. His thesis was published
in 1951 as his first book in the United States, "The Poetry of Ezra
Pound." In it, he deplored Pound for having delivered radio broadcasts
in Italy during World War II in support of that country's fascist
government; at the same time he argued on behalf of the poet's important
literary achievement. The book received the Porter Prize in 1950.

Having completed his degrees Mr. Kenner was appointed an instructor at
Santa Barbara College (later the University of California at Santa
Barbara), where he taught until 1973. From 1973 to 1990 he taught at
Johns Hopkins University, where he was Andrew Mellon professor of
humanities. From 1990 until his retirement in 1999, he taught at the
University of Georgia.

All the while, the writing poured forth, his other major books being
studies of Lewis, Eliot, Beckett, as well as "Ulysses" (1980; revised in
1987), "A Homemade World: The American Modernist Writers" (1975) and "A
Colder Eye: The Modern Irish Writers" (1983).

Over time his prose style grew increasingly graceful, witty and
accessible, prompting C. K. Stead, writing in The Times Literary
Supplement, to call him "the most readable of living critics." He
thought of writing as an "abnormal act," as he told an interviewer at
U.S. News & World Report in 1983, rendered an increasingly "quaint
skill" by the rise of other forms of communication.

Yet he scarcely confined his communication to print. Told by Pound in
the early 1950's "to visit the great men of your own time," Mr. Kenner
befriended many of his subjects, as well as the poet Louis Zukofsky,
Buckminster Fuller and William F. Buckley Jr., who was best man at his
second wedding.

Nor, surprisingly, did he deplore the decline of print as our main
medium. "We forget that most of what people read when everybody read all
the time was junk - competent junk," he told U.S. News & World Report.
"Now they get it from television. The casual entertainment people get in
The evening from the box was what they used to get from the short
fiction in The Saturday Evening Post. That magazine and others like it
were the situation comedies and cop shows of their era. It is not a
cultural loss that this particular use of literacy has been transferred
from one medium to another."

my two little cents...
lori and kyle i think the newsletter is a great idea, and it has been
done really well, thank you for doing it
i think that responses and reports are totally do-able, and should be
done too. i think it would be a great way to make public all of the
thinking and talking that goes on here,to spread it out into a
community, build on it, etc. i dont think it would be hard to find a
few comments regarding most of the events, everybody seems to take
notes and some things actually require a response for the seminars they
are part of. so, yeah, i think it is a good idea, from the perspective
of a(new) student here.

I'm not sure how you can make the distinction between those
who are "depressed" and on medication and those who have
"lesser conditions" and are on medication. I've never been on
meds myself, and, having watched others go on and off them
throughout my life, I find it hard to make a definitive
judgement about them either way. I saw younger siblings and
cousins start on ritolin at the age of five, eventually going on
to Zoloft and others, and I know (very painfully) how
damaging that kind of medicating can be. On the other hand,
there are people in my life who I am certain would not be alive
now if it weren't for similar drugs. One is bad, one is good but
there's no easy way to draw the line. I find it just as horrifying
when people reflexively say that meds are bad bad bad, come
from the man, remove all creativity etc. as when medical
professionals push ritolin on kids and parents. I know plenty
of productive *and* creative artists who are on medication.
The industry is a mess of misinformation, money-making, and
fads, but I think it's wrong to tell someone who's suffering
that they're simply being drugged and taken advantage of if
they try medication. For now, it seems it's up to each
individual to find her/his own way. A person who's creativity
disappears on meds but who can't live without them might try
some different dosages, brands etc. but who are we to say he
should go off them entirely?

I dont think he/she is keying in the messages, but answers in sign
language & someone else keys it in.  that's Koko's live email at the
bottom...  Also it was explained that the use of the word "nipple" is
meant to sound like "people" which Koko doesn't know the sign for.

Komninos, I don't think he can or will. Or that any of us will. I find the
idea of artificial intelligence funny and kind of exciting, if only because
it will be fascinating to see, once some kind of verisimilitude is achieved
in an artificial intelligence system, how that system will inevitably (and
perhaps humorously) differ from actual human function, since the machines
won't be able to help reflecting the particular desires and worldviews of
the person(s) that made them.

How does he intend to get machines lucid dreaming?
I am one who believes that machines can only be intelligent agents, the
smarter they get the smarter the person who made them becomes. Machines can
not surpass humans in intelligence only add to human intelligence because
humans are not just a collection of feedback mechanisms. A software poetry
machine is limited immediately by vocabulary, even if it is being added to
and even if there is a random function, the vocabulary is a fixed item and
the product will become predictable eventually.

non-English language communities or from regions anywhere in the world. Papers may also explore historical, cultural, and literary movements of the period.

Featured presenters will include Robert Creeley, Theodore Enslin, Alan Filreis, Jackson Mac Low, Cristanne Miller, J. Hillis Miller, Harryette Mullen, Marjorie Perloff, Harvey Shapiro, Ruth Stone, Alan Trachtenberg, and Thomas Travisano.

Send a proposed title and a one-page abstract, via regular mail or e-mail, to
Burton Hatlen, Director
National Poetry Foundation
Room 304, 5752 Neville Hall
University of Maine
Orono, ME 04469-5752
Hatlen@Maine.edu

The deadline for proposals is January 15, 2004.

Registration will be $100, or $60 for graduate students. Housing will be available at approximately $40 per day in university residence halls. Additional information concerning registration fees, lodging, and travel will be available on the NPF
website www.ume.maine.edu/~npf/

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

Bipolarity is a construct to be sure, but no less real.  Maps have their
own reality, and their correspondence is validated by their value as a
tool, as a means to a better end.

The most efficient route I found to curing me of the disease known as
poetry, also a construct, is 200 mg of Lamictal daily.  To have poetry
excised from me IS indeed the same as having my bipolarity managed.
Sometimes 1000 poems in 18 months creates some personal problems.
Sometimes creativity needs to pipe down; there's such a thing as too
much.  My doctor disagrees, suggesting that it might not be good to lose
the writing, but I feel relieved.  Confused and somewhat traumatized,
traumatized by the suddenness of the silence, but relieved.

For me, productivity WAS creativity.  The faucet would simply not shut
off.  Now for me, it's a poem here, a poem there.  The volume has been
turned down.  When I hear of poets who stop writing for 30 years I am
heartened.  I now have a chance to lead a "full" life and may actually
avoid leaving some legacy ringed by a horrific emotional crater.
Another construct.  But no less real.

Being left behind by the dead sucks.  Doing the departing before you
have to, in the name of poetry, does no one any good.  The death of a
poet does a good job of stopping the poetry altogether, and it doesn't
promise to make the friends and family of the poet very happy, either.

There are of course competing constructs of poetry of which I write.

I wrote on a two-week cycle.  Two days every 13-16 days would find me
writing as many as 30 poems in an afternoon.  Then silence for another
two weeks.  To be able to write like that is a drug just as the Lamictal
is a drug.  The feeling of power coming from proliferation and that
acutely sharpening insight is intoxicating.  And then it just becomes an
addiction, a nasty festering addiction; the insights keep coming and
coming.  Patrick Herron would cease to exist.  Death in life.  And then
finally the drop-off, and there's a long way to go to the bottom.  And
another death shows up with an open invitation.

There's a relationship here that's akin to the relationship between sex,
fucking, and nymphomania: sex is a high ideal--another
construct--fucking is fantastic, but nymphomania, well, damn, you just
keep going well beyond the point where it feels good, past the point
where it just is no longer fucking, where it becomes its own construct,
no less real, and it begins to hurt.

Art is bullshit if it includes aspirations that require you to forsake
the ones who love you, those most proximal.  If you have no circle of
love then fuck it, swing on.  I simply can't hack it anymore.

The difference between the constructs is mostly in the ancestral tree of
industry.

Love,

I may be overstating the case,
but in my experience often

Bi-polar is often a construct by the psychopharmaco---industry

and thus most articles are already biased and weighted heavily toward
the "norm" of being "non-creative," "efficient," et....

I agree completely-- the goal is to drug up everyone and take away art.
I use myself as an example I was part of one of the first study groups
of kids with ADD, they of course put me on strong drugs-- sure I could
do math then but I was uncreative and my personality was not what I
wanted, now at 36 I have come to some kind of creative/practical
equilibrium-- Now as a creative person who also works in business I must
tell you that creative and control is the real issue

"I was driving back to Nova Scotia along a rural road one night when I
suddenly saw a moose on the side of the road. Since I was back in the
maritimes, and wanted to embrace the culture, and I am an
environmentalist, I chose to use my taser instead of my rifle. Afterall,
I do love animals. Anyway, since I was also within the city limits of
Halifax and is customary of the Halifax Police, I chose, without
probable cause, to use my truncheon, then handcuff moose, but not read
the moose's rights. The moose is expected to appear in court tomorrow

Neo-Benshi, or, Voice over Video
Saturday November 29th, 8:30PM
at Craig Baldwin's Other Cinema
992 Valencia, San Francisco

Though at one time thriving in Japan and Korea in the era of
silent films, the art of the Benshi, or film narrator, has been
all but lost.  Under the inspiration of Japan's Midori Sawato,
whom we have seen perform in Berkeley, California, and who has
maintained the tradition almost single handedly, we would like to
revive this art, with a twist, of course, because we are twisted
after all.

To this end assembled:

Brent Cunningham
Roxanne Hamilton
Jocelyn Saidenberg & Robert Gluck
Scott Stark
Suzanne Stein + 2
Melinda Stone + Bucky!

who each have written a text to narrate, describe and/or
accompany a scene of their own chosing.  Genres will run the
gamut from Cronenberg to home movies to documentary to 30s porn.
Almost everyone will be catered to in some degree.

We hope you will come out to Other Cinema during your
Thanksgiving recess and allow us to decorate some time for you.

Thanks,

I second Chris' comments and would like to add a suggestion that it might be
worthwhile to list subject headings on a periodic basis.  This would provide
a rough index of discussions.  I realize it's impossible to do this
retrospectively which as a former librarian I regret.

As a poet this suggestion would make it likely that I would add thoughts on
the fly as they occured even though as a critic I would be tempted to drag
in references.

I have tended over the course of time to let go and withhold information on
what I think is a balanced basis even though some may say I have a tendency
to spout off poetically.  Probably also my perspective as a psychologist has
not always been welcome.even though as things go this list is less likely to
label people as long as gender is not an issue.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


Unhurried Vision

Michael Rothenberg

November 6 x 9 inches 120 pages=20

Paper: 1-888809-40-X $16.00=20

Underneath the art of poetry exists the tradition of the journal-the =
attempt to capture and reveal the world as it passes by. Observations, =
reflections, and ideas accumulate to form connections and reveal =
process, content and story. Unhurried Vision is a record of the year =
1999, and continues Michael Rothenberg's experiment with the journal. =
This is the year Philip Whalen became terminally ill and Rothenberg =
began taking care of him, pulled together Whalen's archives and library =
and edited his book of selected poems, Overtime. Political, personal, =
and romantic, Unhurried Vision works to savor the impermanent, looking =
at the moments in a poet's life, contemplating the body of experience. =
It is the mind on a quiet stroll through longing, loss and beauty.



Unhurried Vision, a year in the life of Michael, is really a deeply =
loving celebration & farewell to mentor Philip Whalen, poet, roshi, & =
all around confounder of boundaries. A day-book; a non-epic odyssey =
through routes & roots of living & dying; a gastronome's pleasure dome, =
but above all a deeply stirred & stirring affirmation of poetry's =
centrality in realizing mundane & profound instances in the everyday =
extraordinary. Rothenberg's raw footage is disarming; sly, =
self-effacing, proclaiming, doubting, affirming. You can read it in one =
sitting, say blurboligists, but it takes at least a lifetime. & then =
what? -David Meltzer


MICHAEL ROTHENBERG

Born in Miami Beach, Florida in 1951, Michael Rothenberg is a poet and =
songwriter. He has been an active environmentalist in the San Francisco =
Bay Area for the past 25 years, where he cultivates orchids and =
bromeliads at his nursery, Shelldance. His broadside "Elegy for the =
Dusky Seaside Sparrow" was selected Broadside of the Year by Fine Print =
Magazine. The broadside of his poem "Angels" was produced in limited =
edition by Hatch Show Prints as part of The Country Music Foundation's =
museum resources. His songs have appeared in the films Shadowhunter, =
Black Day Blue Night and Outside Ozona. He is also editor and co-founder =
of Big Bridge Press and Big Bridge, an online magazine.=20

Michael Rothenberg divides his time between Pacifica, California and =
Miami, Florida and is on the constant lookout for bottle caps and =
pennies for his son Cosmos.

Apparently the Gothics News Service has revived!

Wounded Screams at Walter Reed
=20
(Washington, D.C., Gothics News Service, November 24, 2003)

 In response to neighborhood complaints, top officials at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center have announced that the Hospital recently installed acoustic
applications for the muffling and, if possible, the complete elimination of
screams, moans, and other dreadful sounds that neighbors claim emanate each
night through the brick walls, double paned windows and cobbled roofs of th=
e
enormous facility. Long considered the Army=B9s center of gravity for complex
care, since the Spring start of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the hospital has
received into its care more than 750 critically wounded and maimed soldiers=
,
including, most famously, Private Jessica Lynch.

Apparently, according to the Center=B9s residential neighbors, one need that
still cannot be met or quelled is the nocturnal howling sounds that are mad=
e
by the suffering soldiers. Hallucinatory battlefield nightmares, intimate
memories associated with the brutal killing of fellow soldiers and the
sights of wounded, tortured and killed Iraqi civilians and soldiers, each
contribute to the blood curdling, wrathful sounds that seem to emerge from
unquenchable depths of these wounded, mostly young people. Many hospital
staff =AD unable to either administer suitable tranquilizers or find
alternative acoustic shelter from within the hospital - are forced to take
time off to find other means of tranquilizing their own, now partially
fractured, nervous systems.

As Operation Iraqi Freedom still continues to generate more and more
casualties, the soldier=B9s unbearable sounds of grief and dread apparently
increased to a level where the neighborhoods around Walter Reed made vivid
complaints to the hospital administration. =B3We and our children are being
driven mad by the insistent noise, =B3 they angrily reported. =B3First we woke
up to the soldier=B9s nightmares; now we wake up to our own. It=B9s not only th=
e
private pain of the soldiers, but people are also convinced that we are als=
o
hearing the voices and sounds of Iraqi wounded and dying. It=B9s as if our ow=
n
soldiers have brought the spirits of the entire war. Late at night, when we
look out on the streets, we actually see many of our neighbors frantically
walking in their sleep, their faces white as the first sheets wrapped aroun=
d
the bodies of the dead, their voices screaming as if they, too, were
casualties in the hospital.=B2

The Walter Reed Hospital Administration has tried to calm people down with
stories that the nocturnal sounds of the wounded are typical of most wars
and that it is the traditional duty of citizens to absorb the shocks of its
wounded. Apparently, however, the local neighborhoods refuse this form of
reasoning. Many are now reported to be calling Senators and Congresspersons
to insist the President=B9s new budget include thick acoustic partitions, and
even domes to protect the entire  neighborhood from the dreaded sounds.

Recently, an interested visitor and English Professor from Baltimore, gave
his thoughts to the local Press. =B3The problem reminds me,=B2 he said, =B3of
Edgar Allan Poe=B9s story, =8CThe Black Cat=B2, the one where the protagonist
keeps trying to bury the cat in order to quench the scream of what he
considers this evil beast. The Hospital=B2 he added,  =B3has been working on
this scream issue since the start of the war. It=B9s, of course, grown with
the increase of casualties. When I went inside the Hospital to investigate,
the corridors and rooms are now a labyrinth of thick, acoustic partitions.
The engineers have even put acoustic padding at intervals through out the
system of air ducts. No matter how much these engineers install, however,
the sound keeps coming out. If it continues, one can imagine the howling
will cross into every town in America, into every house and bedroom, and,
finally, will go all the way up into the White House and the Pentagon and
curdle right into the ears the President, as well as those of Rumsfeld,
Cheney and Wolfolitz.=B2

The Professor did not take questions, preferring to let the facts and
possible consequence speak for themselves. The Walter Reed Center=B9s comment=
s
on his remarks were limited to saying that the gentleman, of course, was at
liberty to say what he wanted, but that his remarks were not consistent wit=
h
the well-known provisions and spirit of either the Patriot or Homeland
Security Act.  =20

       if the creation of the one is simultaneously the
       annihilation of the other and the other is linked
       to the one, such as the annihilation of the one is
       the creation of the other - then there is no need
       of the space and time of the one or the space and
       time of the other. annihilation falls in the slow
       film of water against the pane of existence;
       creation builds across the layered sheets of ice
       as if these were inscribed with all debate and
       method.

       ice in numerous great sheets into sheaves, sheaves
       into bundled sheaves, through the pane everything
       is written, creation and annihilation,
       annihilation and creation.

       if this is so, nikuko, then that is so, and if
       that is so, nikuko, then this is so.

Hill becomes a word and forget is a word. Rain. A pause is heaven leaping through and through. I watch the words come from everywhere there and there. Then. Before we left the house besides it was raining.

4
Rest a while. A pause and a comma determine who are you talking to. She leads with her heart in her head it is there. How are how do you answer to. Run through a common.

5
Pain is mentioned. Partitioned. Speak frankly to the walls in a way.

6
And. How is maintained. Milk before water. Brush past and in striking the moment without a reasoning. What is a reasoning besides what it is it is not. Milk comes before water is not milk. It is somewhat milk was.

7
Following a train. Word wreck reason. I prefer daffodil. Tripping is a start to when is it time again.

8
Run to here.

9
Run from.

10
Rhyme. Thank you. Thank you for. He follows me in a decision that asks nothing nothing is asked in what is the reason for this. The plural am I are we to see the last time we are here. Tripping reasoning.

11
Against everything and almost against everything. A cup of water is waiting out against what is not. A dog is someone getting wet. What is the last time I have you have said this. See the sentence to your hearts content. A wet blanket warm blanket keep blankets marry him and only him. Only him. Only and only and only.

12
I am either I am either.

13
A glass is through this. The other side of a glass sees through I am. Closer to the steps feeling the rest of the head in the heartland. Milk and Honey and Milk and Honey and Milk and Honey and Milk and Honey. Milk and Honey. And Milk and Honey. I am hungry.
14
A sentiment is. A sentiment is challenged. Change the sentence. A charming man or not a man wondering was it him or was it not him who was it then. I turned to him though I am hungry a man never eats in his sleep unless he is without it. Sleep.


15
Rain eats the pain. Is it left.

16
Pain.

17
The last and the very last time was spent spending time this time I’ll earn your dear mouth and a ring to put on this rhyme does it rhyme with tick or tock or what it is that measurement of tick or tock and tick or tock and tick or tock and tick or tock or is it both that rhyme with it. Time. Turn. To close a glass is too close. It will be nice to say goodbye and hello again in time. Time is money so they say does it make us change at the same time. Needless to say.

18
Running back to when.

19
I prefer Toldeo over Chicago. Over and over and over. They said when it rains it snows. Honestly can it be measured what is the difference between Toledo and Chicago. Does it matter what is that inside a persons head. Does it matter what is that inside a person is a head or a heart. An occasion. An occasion erupts out of duty. Is it called duty or is it called to duty. Behave is a word and I am not. This is what is meant by Time is Money. Time is Money.

20
        Bring is the same as frog. Does it hit the nail on the head with a ring. They are determined.

21
Hello.

22
Hello.

23
Now is not an answer. Six is an answer to your or whose question. Now is never.

24
Seven turns the rocks over to find.

25
I only an inkling am. When you see me.

26
Find me.

27
A wish.

28
In a hat.

29
Turn your head you will see me I am at once.

30
When you see me turn and turn and turn until what you see. That is me.

One of my supervisors during
my psychoanalytic training
in the late 70's and early 80's, Dr
Alexander Wolf, a psychiatrist
and psychoanalyst felt there
was a strong correlation between
manic-depression and creativity.
Unfortunately I can't locate
the paper he wrote on this
subject, and I'm not even
sure he ever got around
to publishing it,
but he frequently discussed
this topic with me as he was
interested in my writing, and
even wrote a blurb for
on of my books. He was one
of the least judgmental people
I have ever known.

In any case, I think being a poet
or an artist is a very stressful
occupation for innumerable reasons
for most people
and if someone who worked in
one of these fields
wasn't that anxious or
depressed to begin with, I would
be very surprised if after a number
of years of working as an artist,
actor, poet, etc, if they didn't eventually
have to confront quite a lot of
anxiety and depression, and
accept it as part of the job.
The reasons are too obvious to
list here, but I have yet to meet
anyone in the field of poetry who
didn't have to struggle with a more
than average number and degree of ups and downs,
call it what you will; that there are
those with extremely more intense swings than
others I do not doubt; but most poets have to
go through a lot of this whether or
not they are particularly vulnerable
to mood swings or have been diagnosed
with a related psychiatric issue. I am not making
light of the diagnostic aspect; but i am trying to identify
a more endemic, connected issue.

The issue of quantity of production is
a particular concern of mine. The dynamics
of contemporary poetry seems to push these
days for quantity, I'm not sure why this
is, and I have found the discussion about
this issue of great interest and value.

Someone very close to me starting taking ADD for various reasons---
not "by-polar" per se....and got hooked, started taking too much of it---
it eventually lead this person to have a breakdown and start hearing voices,
a problem this person never had before taking this drug called ADDEROL---
soon the person was taking anti-psychotics, for "depression" issues,
and is hoping soon to get off them, but.....

i need to know more about what scientists and "scientists" say about
the relationship between what they call ADD and "manic-depression"---
it seems some say they are on a continuum; and others that they are
different in kind...
but, and i mean this as no respect to folks like David K,
i do think at times there's such a thing as healthy skepticism
about SOME diagnoses of things like ADD
(and i leave the clinical depression issue out of it for now...)

Hy hsn!

I welcome any and all polycephalic entendres.  Thank you!

I can't say one came first, productivity or creativity.  With mania, in
in my case, which means long periods of hypomania punctuated by short
periods of mania, the pair showed up as such--a pair.   Ideas were
flying and so too were the fingers, and sometimes I can't remember any
ideas but I possess at the very least the artifacts of typing, of
producing.  I think they are in some way the same thing, or, rather,
that creativity is a subset of productivity.  Creativity is in my mind
imaginative (or sometimes absent-minded or even self-abandoned)
production: the product is what's being created, whereas imagining
something creative is not quite, well, creating much of anything.  I can
imagine a trip to the sun but in doing so in some sense I'm not exactly
*creating* a trip to the sun.  But maybe I have this all wrong.  I might
be too materialistic in my assessment.  Dunno.

I'm glad to see folks being open about this.  Thanks especially to
David.  Mental health care is abysmal in the US, and that is a
reflection of our population's attitudes towards health problems of a
neurological nature.  Mutation is in many ways a good thing, something
to be OK with, but mutation is something to fix up a little when it goes
awry.

What's fucked up about the disorder is that it yields tasty treats.
Unlike a crack habit, at the end of the day, with mania you end up with
more (in my case, poems, computer code, interface designs, photographs,
recordings, music, a really clean house, etc.) than at the start.  A
sort of personal alchemical kit.  Something coming out of nothing.
"Ephemeralizing matter."  Making more out of less.   There's that
production thing again.  And the creativity.  Showing up together.

Disease may be a metaphor or a construct or a representational framework
or a model, etc., but then so too is death I guess, and that's a
metaphor I frankly don't like very much.  Having to go through the
deaths of people very close to me at ages they shouldn't die, well, I
just don't want to put other people close to me through that grief I
went through.  Despite the best efforts of Death and its Republican
Party there are so many reasons to live.  Poetry just isn't nearly as
important as living.  Poetry should somehow improve living, not exhaust
it.  Fortunately I can still have my life and eat it too: the poetry is
still around.  It just frequents my cranial saloon less frequently.  And
right now it's just no longer so insightful as it was.

Actually, I believe bipolarity is in some ways very much like sickle
cell anemia or cystic fibrosis: it's a disease that also happens to be
an adaptation--something that provides huge benefits for a population
(namely, survival of the population) while levying a high cost on the
individual exhibiting the mutation.  If curing sickle cell anemia or CF
isn't so bad, then why not cure bipolar disorder?  Creative production
(a phrase that may be redundant) is the benefit of the disorder.  I mean
to say that at least in some but certainly not all cases is it
beneficial, of course.

I second Dave K.'s recommendation of Kay Redfield Jameson's book
_Touched with Fire_.

Urgent Call to Action: FTAA Protesters Brutalized in Miami

To send a free fax to Mayor Diaz see:
http://www.citizen.org/fax/background.cfm?ID=245&source=19

This week thousands of protestors came to Miami to oppose the FTAA.  The
Free Trade Agreement of the Americas is an international trade agreement
that aims to extend corporate control throughout the Western Hemisphere.

Prior to the mass action there was a calculated campaign on the part of
the police to intimidate and harass protestors.  One officer
characterized this campaign by saying "You can beat the rap, but not the
ride".

As we feared, our protests were met by a massive show of state
repression, backed by $8.5 million in US Government funding.  Miami
Police
Commissioner John Timoney oversaw a massive, paramilitary assault on our
constitutional and human rights

Protestors were attacked by police wielding batons, tear gas, pepper
spray, rubber, wooden, and plastic bullets and other chemical agents.
Over
100 protestors were treated for injuries; 12 were hospitalized. Police
dispersed large groups of peaceful protestors with tear gas, pepper
spray
and open fire.  Small groups leaving the protests were harassed,
arrested
and beaten. This campaign of fear and intimidation culminated in the
closure and militarization of downtown Miami. There were confirmed
reports
of military tanks patrolling the streets after dark on Thursday night.

Our legal team estimates more than 250 arrests.  People have become
political prisoners and are being held in jail.  More than 50 of them
were
arrested while holding a peaceful vigil outside the jail in
solidarity with those inside.  They were surrounded by riot police and
ordered to disperse.  As they did, police opened fire and blocked the
streets preventing many from leaving.

We are now receiving reports from people being released or calling from
jail that there is excessive brutality, sexual assault and torture going
on inside.  People of color, Queer and transgender prisoners are
particularly being targeted.  There are two confirmed reports of
released prisoners being hospitalized for injuries sustained while in
custody, including one Latino man arrested along with 62 others outside
Miami-Dade County Jail Friday, who was just recently upgraded from the
Intensive Care Unit for injuries from blows to the head.

We call on people from around the globe to take action immediately to
support our sisters and brothers who are being unfairly arrested and
brutalized.    We are calling for three immediate actions:

1) Call, fax, email elected officials with the demands listed below.
Contact information below.

2)  Money is urgently needed to get people out of jail.   They are
making
everyone post between $100 - $5000 in bail.  We are working with bail
bondsmen, but this is not enough.  Send money to cover legal and
jail-support expenses including: bail, getting people rides back home
and
other legal costs.  Please send money to:  United for Peace and Justice.
Online donations are possible at
www.unitedforpeace.org/ftaadonate  You can also mail a check or money
order to:  United for Peace and Justice/FTAA Fund P.O. Box 607, Times
Square Station, New York, NY  10108. Please specify Legal Fund in the
memo
field:

3) Global Day of Action on Monday at any time and any appropriate
location.  This could be US Embassies, Departments of Justice or FBI
offices.

THESE ARE OUR DEMANDS:
-- Drop all charges.
-- Release all political prisoners.
-- Meet basic human needs: no more brutality, provide appropriate food,
    access to medicine and medical attention, warm clothing.
-- Provide access to attorneys and visitation rights.
-- Provide equitable treatment to all prisoners.
-- Do not share information collected with the INS.
-- Fire Chief of police John Timoney

Many thanks for your support. It is urgently needed.

Since Mr. Kurzweil and Mr. Keklak have a patent on the algorithm in
the program, it is not at all clear that this package could actually

I have found this discussion very interesting too, and I love Patrick's =
gauntlet thrown in honor of love. =20

I am a very "border" person: I feel I am literally a seam: between Ireland =
and America, sometimes between generations, between experimental and =
lyric, very between in too many ways to mention.  But I've been lucky in =
being able to walk that fine or ragged line without falling much further =
than my knees. =20

Recently I've had bouts of hypergraphia: exhilarating but with frightening =
views from the windows.  I've had glimpses of what it might be like to be =
eaten alive by poetry, or to implode.  A few days ago, I had the opposite =
experience: I was asked to participate in a movie: we stood around for =
hours just like they say you do.  It was fantastic.  Everything was slowed =
down.  I could actually see the director think.  We stood around calmly =
watching him think.  I looked at people's eyes: stunning.  I looked at how =
their hair grew.  When words were exchanged: you could hear them being =
pronounced, eased out and presented, the sense still ripe on them.  It was =
a marvellous thing to stand around with strangers in agreement to be, to =
wait, to attend.  It was a form of meditation.  It seems if one could slow =
down and remove the varnish customarily worn, the very air would grow =
hair.  But who will steer you home?  And who will hold you when you move =
too fast?

I think one of my reasons for being interested in this discussion is my =
increasing appreciation for how experience invests words with meaning. =
That sounds trite and it is.  One year words like "alcoholism," "divorce," =
or "bipolar" are known concepts.  The next, they are countries one is =
inhabiting, with landscapes, villages, forests, coastlines, quagmires, and =
frightful winds. =20

This is all a long thank you to Patrick.  Thank you Patrick!

One of my supervisors during
my psychoanalytic training
in the late 70's and early 80's, Dr
Alexander Wolf, a psychiatrist
and psychoanalyst felt there
was a strong correlation between
manic-depression and creativity.
Unfortunately I can't locate
the paper he wrote on this
subject, and I'm not even
sure he ever got around
to publishing it,
but he frequently discussed
this topic with me as he was
interested in my writing, and
even wrote a blurb for
on of my books. He was one
of the least judgmental people
I have ever known.

In any case, I think being a poet
or an artist is a very stressful
occupation for innumerable reasons
for most people
and if someone who worked in
one of these fields
wasn't that anxious or
depressed to begin with, I would
be very surprised if after a number
of years of working as an artist,
actor, poet, etc, if they didn't eventually
have to confront quite a lot of
anxiety and depression, and
accept it as part of the job.
The reasons are too obvious to
list here, but I have yet to meet
anyone in the field of poetry who
didn't have to struggle with a more
than average number and degree of ups and downs,
call it what you will; that there are
those with extremely more intense swings than
others I do not doubt; but most poets have to
go through a lot of this whether or
not they are particularly vulnerable
to mood swings or have been diagnosed
with a related psychiatric issue. I am not making
light of the diagnostic aspect; but i am trying to identify
a more endemic, connected issue.

The issue of quantity of production is
a particular concern of mine. The dynamics
of contemporary poetry seems to push these
days for quantity, I'm not sure why this
is, and I have found the discussion about
this issue of great interest and value.

Dear Jessica, chris, tom: thanks so much to all of you for your
suggestions--and I absolutely agree with you!  Michael Cross did write a
report of Barrett Watten's reading, but ideally, eventually, every reading
event that we list in the newsletter would include the introduction, a
report (or two or three), and video or sound; also, as Jessica pointed out,
a lot of insightful and compelling work around guest speakers takes place
in the classroom that should somehow find its way out.  I think quite a few
of us see how necessary it is for poetics both to extend itself beyond its
own boundaries as much as possible and to take care of its history--some
way to track continuation and departure.  BUT I'm not yet sure whether a
blog or a "normal" website is the best way to do this--I was interested in
the discussion that took place a few weeks ago between Nick Piombino and
Tim Peterson about the function of blogs (compared to listservs) and
genuinely wonder whether or not a website that's updated once a month
couldn't, in this case, serve the same function as a blog while being
(aesthetically and practically) more flexible--the newsletter isn't, after
all, so much for daily or weekly discussion generated by one person so much
as it's for documentation and archiving.

Best, Lori

Subject:      Promotion is over
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Promotion is hard words. Promotion is never an apology. Promotion is
the sorriest act. Promotion is noble and nice. Promotion is
consolation for a generation. Promotion is as promotion does.

Promotion is the highest act of selfishness and needed in every home.
Promotion is the bittersweet biography of a plutonium expert.
Promotion is another day.

Promotion is back and improved, and promotion is covert. Promotion is
the scarriest word I have ever heard and yet I am in promotion, it is
my business to beat the heart and shit out of people regardless.
Promotion is a little Japanese guy in an even smaller business suit.

Promotion is memory resident and connected to the following things:
fear, shame, sound.

Promotion is motion and used in students' summer work. Promotion is
often overlooked.  Promotion is designed to generate attention.
Promotion is necessary, underrated and valid till December 31.

Promotion is better than disease prevention. Promotion is state of
the art and free underway.  Promotion is not just a problem in
schools. Promotion is building up in your back yard. Promotion is
back.

Promotion is available for enrollment in relations concerning men and
women over 40. Promotion is the super hero of legal residents.
Promotion is priority. Promotion is here to ensure. Promotion is big.

Promotion is passion. Promotion is a database of human resources, a
stealth technology that we'll use in order to find higher links.
Promotion is the process of supporting people to increase control
over the factors that influence their health and quality of life.
Promotion is marble.

Fake is over. Regret is a literary condition. Rural roots closing
down their tech support is crazy. Is it possibly over? Over is fucked
hard by a guy with a big ummm. Over is a last resort but regret is
hearsay. Sheldon Richmond is improving. A senior economist in the
development research group is improving. Your favorite wrestler would
like his rigidity supervised. Rigidity is over is often less
spontaneous is in da house is often added like an answer to a prayer.
Promotion is over. Sorry.

Over is just one of many simple verbal first aid concepts that can
work miracles by triggering the body's natural healing mechanisms.
Over is 13th street. Over is high. Is the state table-sharing between
firewalls? Is a lifelike newborn doll used to educate young people
about the realities of parenting? Is wearing a seatbelt wearing a
seatbelt? Promotion is over. Sorry.

A brilliant book is over. An androsterone guy with big pheromone
Puerto Rican girl sits on the recording industry and spins over in
dog pose, repelling waste and environmental destruction of limitless
military adventures and expenditures.

Sorry, promotion is over.

No, I don't think so.  But where can I find that one, in case I decide to

"I have found this discussion very interesting too, and I love Patrick's
gauntlet thrown in honor of love. "

i 'second' this opinion.  his post made my day.  And going along with what
Nick said research is showing that some people are sensitive to things.  My
poetic self is sensitive, sometimes over-sensitive, and it's a question of
how much medication or poetry to take.

iterating
****
In a society of the routine, of the common schedule instead of the common
area, word-virus dismantles the mechanics of the normal. Normalcy, the
pinnacle of standardization & the ultimate product of all institutions, is
fundamentally the spectacle of hierarchy. The strait line of consistency,
the loaded dice in which uncertainty is excluded from the set, the
prediction consumed by the repetition of the perfect representation. This
representation is the mass simulation of a national & global consensus.
(Blank) is always a destruction of diversity, & this pseudo-consensus
presents the average of the average. The majority, the people, & the crowd.
The pseudo-consensus, carefully manufactured by the process of
genre-fication & stereotype, justifies all of society in terms of
consumptive power, through which all facets of life are for sale, including
identity.

In this understanding of a society whose only goal is to maintain the
predictability of all actions, word-virus is a strategy of the street
performer who refuses to be purchased, & by being purchased, negated.
(Blank) is the aberration in language & thought which breaks societies
regularly scheduled program.
****
We live in a society bent on decoding life solely on the terms of
consumption. One who is intelligent has consumed knowledge & therefore is
able to reproduce this knowledge as an exact replica. This is the logic of
standardized tests, and "tests" are the fundamental process through which
government functions.

Polls, the Ballot, entrance exams, & SAT's
****
Collectively, images of consumption contain nothing but overt displays of
power & in this sense are static.
****
Throughout the history of civilization, hierarchy has required the image of
accumulation. The process of accumulation, & also its image, requires a
standard, & a police, by which the boundaries of property & expansion can be
maintained.
****
Iteration is not repetition. (Blank) bears more of a shared definition with
recycling because the results are reintegrated into the system.
****
Word-virus skews the society of mirrors, creating the gesture of play &
nonsense.
    Through a system of programming, well-adjusted citizens internalize the
manufactured standard, or the 24 hour-per-day mirror of compulsion, through
which all of life is formalized as that which can be consumed now & in the
future.
    In this sense, the mirror expresses this deeply embedded system of
consumption, because what we are has been transformed into what we are not.
****
How was it for you?

I wanted to thank everyone who has most generously responded to the bi-polar
issue (treatment, etc.) that I have raised from my experience with my
artist-poet friend. I have been able to share with him both private and
public list responses - of which he and I are most appreciative.

Thanks again and happy Thanksgiving to all,

Hi all, just thought I'd let you know about a couple new publications of mine in
case you're interested.  Two articles which you oughta be able to find in most
university libraries:

"The Motives of Emancipated Prose: Emerson and the Collaborating Reader," in ESQ
47:4, pp. 279-326.

"Ralph Ellison: Pragmatis, Jazz and the American Vernacular," in Transactions of
the Charles S. Peirce Society 39:2, pp. 227-258.

If you can't track down a copy I'd be happy to send either along to you.

On a rather different front, the Mainstream Poets have posted a bunch of new
work recently, including a prose poem "Tom Brokaw," a series of Williams and
Stevens parodies (if one can call them that) and a repost of the timeless
holiday classic, "Happy Spanksgiving."  Enjoy.

-m.

This morning i wrote to clayton eshleman to ask if
he'd be innerested in reading at my apt., since
the only appearance i knew about was his afternoon
reading at SFSU. lo and behold, there are two TWO
more opportunities to see mr. eshleman read in san
francisco next week. read on:

dear david: thanks for contacting me. i am booked
every night while in the bay area. you can tell
your friends who cannot make the SF State program
at 4:30, that i will be at the booksmith on haight
near golden state park on friday the 5th, at 7 pm.
on sunday at 7:30 i will do the same program at
cody's in berkeley. so maybe those occasions will
work for people who work during the day.
    the book i will be focusing on is Juniper
Fuse: Upper Paleolithic Imagination & the
Construction of the Underworld (wesleyan, 2003).
  best regards,  clayton

 'creativity is a subset of productivity' I can see that. Although when
'imagination /imaginative' is added in
We're into a jargon I want  to avoid; it relates to alien kinds of poetics
more than to my own, and to what people who do not make art (like
psychiatrists, for instance) think art-making, or art knowledge is. But then
I know almost nothing about mental 'ill-health' so maybe these terms are
usefully deployed in relation to its inter-connections with writing.  Can
'creativity' in particular be refurbished as a meaningful concept through
them?

Hy hsn!

I welcome any and all polycephalic entendres.  Thank you!

I can't say one came first, productivity or creativity.  With mania, in in
my case, which means long periods of hypomania punctuated by short
periods of mania, the pair showed up as such--a pair.   Ideas were
flying and so too were the fingers, and sometimes I can't remember any ideas
but I possess at the very least the artifacts of typing, of producing.  I
think they are in some way the same thing, or, rather, that creativity is a
subset of productivity.  Creativity is in my mind imaginative (or sometimes
absent-minded or even self-abandoned)
production: the product is what's being created, whereas imagining something
creative is not quite, well, creating much of anything.  I can imagine a
trip to the sun but in doing so in some sense I'm not exactly
*creating* a trip to the sun.  But maybe I have this all wrong.  I might be
too materialistic in my assessment.  Dunno.

I'm glad to see folks being open about this.  Thanks especially to David.
Mental health care is abysmal in the US, and that is a reflection of our
population's attitudes towards health problems of a neurological nature.
Mutation is in many ways a good thing, something to be OK with, but mutation
is something to fix up a little when it goes awry.

What's fucked up about the disorder is that it yields tasty treats. Unlike a
crack habit, at the end of the day, with mania you end up with more (in my
case, poems, computer code, interface designs, photographs, recordings,
music, a really clean house, etc.) than at the start.  A sort of personal
alchemical kit.  Something coming out of nothing.
"Ephemeralizing matter."  Making more out of less.   There's that
production thing again.  And the creativity.  Showing up together.

Disease may be a metaphor or a construct or a representational framework or
a model, etc., but then so too is death I guess, and that's a metaphor I
frankly don't like very much.  Having to go through the deaths of people
very close to me at ages they shouldn't die, well, I just don't want to put
other people close to me through that grief I went through.  Despite the
best efforts of Death and its Republican Party there are so many reasons to
live.  Poetry just isn't nearly as important as living.  Poetry should
somehow improve living, not exhaust it.  Fortunately I can still have my
life and eat it too: the poetry is still around.  It just frequents my
cranial saloon less frequently.  And right now it's just no longer so
insightful as it was.

Actually, I believe bipolarity is in some ways very much like sickle cell
anemia or cystic fibrosis: it's a disease that also happens to be an
adaptation--something that provides huge benefits for a population (namely,
survival of the population) while levying a high cost on the individual
exhibiting the mutation.  If curing sickle cell anemia or CF isn't so bad,
then why not cure bipolar disorder?  Creative production (a phrase that may
be redundant) is the benefit of the disorder.  I mean to say that at least
in some but certainly not all cases is it beneficial, of course.

I second Dave K.'s recommendation of Kay Redfield Jameson's book _Touched
with Fire_.

The Northern Griots Network is a non-profit organization, founded in the
Summer of 2003,  which functions as an umbrella association of African
Canadian spoken word poets and  poetry promoters.

Our members operate poetry series in Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto,
and Vancouver.

We endeavour to assist African Canadian spoken word poets
in accessing resources and information that can help them develop their
skills and careers.

The NGN is currently operating an Xchange tour, a series of poetry
events across Canada which provide poets from matched cities to travel
and perform. The performances are taking place from September, 2003 to
February, 2004. Come out and enjoy a show near you!

We would like to thank the Canada Council for the Arts for their
assistance, as well as big up our membership for their spirit of unity
and collective development, and for their commitment to the art of
spoken word poetry in Canada and abroad. Please support the cultural
productions of NGN members.

Come hear Lisa Jarnot read from
BLACK DOG SONGS
(Flood Editions ISBN 0-9710059-9-0 $13.00)

on Thursday, December 4th at 7pm

at Teachers & Writers in NYC
5 Union Square West, 7th floor
http://www.twc.org/events.htm

Black Dog Songs is Lisa Jarnot's third volume of poetry.
Decidedly lyrical, these poems move through pastures and
politics to the quick of thought. What emerges is a catalog
of loves and laments: "Just the eldergrass and him,
the fog, unpoliced and safe inside the train, the thoughts of
rain, Apollo, and the sun . . ."

Copies of the book will be available at the reading, or
directly from the publisher, or through spd / Small Press

I can't think where that one is - I recall a phrase about the notion that
the replacement of the horse by the automobile had altered the human sense
of poetic rhythm.

'Me? I thought, OBE me? Up yours, I thought'

An invitation to the palace to accept an New Year honour... you must be
joking. Benjamin Zephaniah won't be going. Here he explains why

Thursday November 27, 2003
The Guardian


I woke up on the morning of November 13 wondering how the government
could be overthrown and what could replace it, and then I noticed a
letter from the prime minister's office. It said: "The prime minister
has asked me to inform you, in strict confidence, that he has in mind,
on the occasion of the forthcoming list of New Year's honours to submit
your name to the Queen with a recommendation that Her Majesty may be
graciously pleased to approve that you be appointed an officer of the
Order of the British Empire."
Me? I thought, OBE me? Up yours, I thought. I get angry when I hear that
word "empire"; it reminds me of slavery, it reminds of thousands of
years of brutality, it reminds me of how my foremothers were raped and
my forefathers brutalised. It is because of this concept of empire that
my British education led me to believe that the history of black people
started with slavery and that we were born slaves, and should therefore
be grateful that we were given freedom by our caring white masters. It
is because of this idea of empire that black people like myself don't
even know our true names or our true historical culture. I am not one of
those who are obsessed with their roots, and I'm certainly not suffering
from a crisis of identity; my obsession is about the future and the
political rights of all people. Benjamin Zephaniah OBE - no way Mr
Blair, no way Mrs Queen. I am profoundly anti-empire.

There's something very strange about receiving a letter from Tony
Blair's office asking me if I want to accept this award. In the past
couple of months I've been on Blair's doorstep a few times. I have
begged him to come out and meet me; I have been longing for a
conversation with him, but he won't come out, and now here he is asking
me to meet him at the palace! I was there with a million people on
February 15, and the last time I was there was just a couple of weeks
ago. My cousin, Michael Powell, was arrested and taken to Thornhill Road
police station in Birmingham where he died. Now, I know how he died. The
whole of Birmingham knows how he died, but in order to get this article
published and to be politically (or journalistically) correct, I have to
say that he died in suspicious circumstances. The police will not give
us any answers. We have not seen or heard anything of all the reports
and investigations we were told were going to take place. Now, all that
my family can do is join with all the other families who have lost
members while in custody because no one in power is listening to us.
Come on Mr Blair, I'll meet you anytime. Let's talk about your Home
Office, let's talk about being tough on crime.

This OBE thing is supposed to be for my services to literature, but
there are a whole lot of writers who are better than me, and they're not
involved in the things that I'm involved in. All they do is write; I
spend most of my time doing other things. If they want to give me one of
these empire things, why can't they give me one for my work in animal
rights? Why can't they give me one for my struggle against racism? What
about giving me one for all the letters I write to innocent people in
prisons who have been framed? I may just consider accepting some kind of
award for my services on behalf of the millions of people who have stood
up against the war in Iraq. It's such hard work - much harder than
writing poems.

And hey, if Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to lay all that empire
stuff on me, why can't she write to me herself. Let's cut out the
middleman - she knows me. The last time we met, it was at a concert I
was hosting. She came backstage to meet me. That didn't bother me; lots
of people visit my dressing room after performances. Me and the South
African performers I was working with that night thought it rather funny
that we had a royal groupie. She's a bit stiff but she's a nice old
lady. Let me make it clear: I have nothing against her or the royal
family. It is the institution of the monarchy that I loathe so very
much, the monarchy that still refuses to apologise for sanctioning
slavery.

There is a part of me that hopes that after writing this article I shall
never be considered as a Poet Laureate or an OBE sucker again. Let this
put an end to it. This may lose me some of my writing friends; some
people may never want to work with me again, but the truth is I think
OBEs compromise writers and poets, and laureates suddenly go soft - in
the past I've even written a poem, Bought and Sold, saying that.

There are many black writers who love OBEs, it makes them feel like they
have made it. When it suits them, they embrace the struggle against the
ruling class and the oppression they visit upon us, but then they join
the oppressors' club. They are so easily seduced into the great house of
Babylon known as the palace. For them, a wonderful time is meeting the
Queen and bowing before her presence.

I was shocked to see how many of my fellow writers jumped at the
opportunity to go to Buckingham Palace when the Queen had her "meet the
writers day" on July 9 2002, and I laughed at the pathetic excuses
writers gave for going. "I did it for my mum"; "I did it for my kids";
"I did it for the school"; "I did it for the people", etc. I have even
heard black writers who have collected OBEs saying that it is "symbolic
of how far we have come". Oh yes, I say, we've struggled so hard just to
get a minute with the Queen and we are so very grateful - not.

I've never heard of a holder of the OBE openly criticising the monarchy.
They are officially friends, and that's what this cool Britannia project
is about. It gives OBEs to cool rock stars, successful businesswomen and
blacks who would be militant in order to give the impression that it is
inclusive. Then these rock stars, successful women, and ex-militants
write to me with the OBE after their name as if I should be impressed.
I'm not. Quite the opposite - you've been had.

Writers and artists who see themselves as working outside the
establishment are constantly being accused of selling out as soon as
they have any kind of success. I've been called a sell-out for selling
too many books, for writing books for children, for performing at the
Royal Albert Hall, for going on Desert Island Discs, and for appearing
on the Parkinson show. But I want to reach as many people as possible
without compromising the content of my work.

What continues to be my biggest deal with the establishment must be my
work with the British Council, of which, ironically, the Queen is
patron. I have no problem with this. It has never told me what to say,
or what not to say. I have always been free to criticise the government
and even the council itself. This is what being a poet is about. Most
importantly, through my work with the council I am able to show the
world what Britain is really about in terms of our arts, and I am able
to partake in the type of political and cultural intercourse which is
not possible in the mainstream political arena. I have no problem
representing the reality of our multiculturalism, which may sometimes
mean speaking about the way my cousin Michael died in a police station.
But then, I am also at ease letting people know that our music scene is
more than what they hear in the charts, and that British poetry is more
than Wordsworth, or even Motion. I have no problem with all of this
because this is about us and what we do. It is about what happens on the
streets of our country and not in the palace or at No 10.

Me, OBE? Whoever is behind this offer can never have read any of my
work. Why don't they just give me some of those great African works of
art that were taken in the name of the empire and let me return them to
their rightful place? You can't fool me, Mr Blair. You want to privatise
us all; you want to send us to war. You stay silent when we need you to
speak for us, preferring to be the voice of the US. You have lied to us,
and you continue to lie to us, and you have poured the working-class
dream of a fair, compassionate, caring society down the dirty drain of
empire. Stick it, Mr Blair - and Mrs Queen, stop going on about the
empire. Let's do something else.

Is killing off black poetry
It's not censors or dictators that are cutting up our art.
The lure of meeting royalty
And touching high society
Is damping creativity and eating at our heart.

The ancestors would turn in graves
Those poor black folk that once were slaves would wonder
How our souls were sold
And check our strategies,
The empire strikes back and waves
Tamed warriors bow on parades
When they have done what they've been told
They get their OBEs.

Don't take my word, go check the verse
Cause every laureate gets worse
A family that you cannot fault as muse will mess your mind,
And yeah, you may fatten your purse
And surely they will check you first when subjects need to be amused
With paid for prose and rhymes.

Take your prize, now write more,
Faster,
Fuck the truth
Now you're an actor do not fault your benefactor
Write, publish and review,
You look like a dreadlocks Rasta,
You look like a ghetto blaster,
But you can't diss your paymaster
And bite the hand that feeds you.

What happened to the verse of fire
Cursing cool the empire
What happened to the soul rebel that Marley had in mind,
This bloodstained, stolen empire rewards you and you conspire,
(Yes Marley said that time will tell)
Now look they've gone and joined.

We keep getting this beating
It's bad history repeating
It reminds me of those capitalists that say
'Look you have a choice,'
It's sick and self-defeating if our dispossessed keep weeping
And we give these awards meaning
But we end up with no voice.

Yeah, Zephaniah said the same, but more briefly, on the radio this morning.
I feel delighted that a fellow Brummie has taken this stance, even on
supposedly progressive groups it can be noticeable how expressing demurral
at the honours system can arouse censure. I think of anthologies of English
verse and how utterly wrong 'Sir William Empson' or 'Sir Stephen Spender'
looks in the table of contents. Recent poets in England to accept honours
(C.B.E's I think) include Jo Shapcott and C.A.Duffy.

England of course is NOT a class society and the rumour that we have an
hereditary monarchy in the name of which ALL power is exercised (i.e. the
'Crown') making us all subjects rather than citizens and thus without ANY
inalienable rights are of course wildly untrue.

And everybody in England lives in a country mansion and goes to public
school unless they grew up as members of-a-pop-group-to-be, or invisible
(for instance, black).

An invitation to the palace to accept an New Year honour... you must be
joking. Benjamin Zephaniah won't be going. Here he explains why

Thursday November 27, 2003
The Guardian


I woke up on the morning of November 13 wondering how the government
could be overthrown and what could replace it, and then I noticed a
letter from the prime minister's office. It said: "The prime minister
has asked me to inform you, in strict confidence, that he has in mind,
on the occasion of the forthcoming list of New Year's honours to submit
your name to the Queen with a recommendation that Her Majesty may be
graciously pleased to approve that you be appointed an officer of the
Order of the British Empire."
Me? I thought, OBE me? Up yours, I thought. I get angry when I hear that
word "empire"; it reminds me of slavery, it reminds of thousands of
years of brutality, it reminds me of how my foremothers were raped and
my forefathers brutalised. It is because of this concept of empire that
my British education led me to believe that the history of black people
started with slavery and that we were born slaves, and should therefore
be grateful that we were given freedom by our caring white masters. It
is because of this idea of empire that black people like myself don't
even know our true names or our true historical culture. I am not one of
those who are obsessed with their roots, and I'm certainly not suffering
from a crisis of identity; my obsession is about the future and the
political rights of all people. Benjamin Zephaniah OBE - no way Mr
Blair, no way Mrs Queen. I am profoundly anti-empire.

There's something very strange about receiving a letter from Tony
Blair's office asking me if I want to accept this award. In the past
couple of months I've been on Blair's doorstep a few times. I have
begged him to come out and meet me; I have been longing for a
conversation with him, but he won't come out, and now here he is asking
me to meet him at the palace! I was there with a million people on
February 15, and the last time I was there was just a couple of weeks
ago. My cousin, Michael Powell, was arrested and taken to Thornhill Road
police station in Birmingham where he died. Now, I know how he died. The
whole of Birmingham knows how he died, but in order to get this article
published and to be politically (or journalistically) correct, I have to
say that he died in suspicious circumstances. The police will not give
us any answers. We have not seen or heard anything of all the reports
and investigations we were told were going to take place. Now, all that
my family can do is join with all the other families who have lost
members while in custody because no one in power is listening to us.
Come on Mr Blair, I'll meet you anytime. Let's talk about your Home
Office, let's talk about being tough on crime.

This OBE thing is supposed to be for my services to literature, but
there are a whole lot of writers who are better than me, and they're not
involved in the things that I'm involved in. All they do is write; I
spend most of my time doing other things. If they want to give me one of
these empire things, why can't they give me one for my work in animal
rights? Why can't they give me one for my struggle against racism? What
about giving me one for all the letters I write to innocent people in
prisons who have been framed? I may just consider accepting some kind of
award for my services on behalf of the millions of people who have stood
up against the war in Iraq. It's such hard work - much harder than
writing poems.

And hey, if Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to lay all that empire
stuff on me, why can't she write to me herself. Let's cut out the
middleman - she knows me. The last time we met, it was at a concert I
was hosting. She came backstage to meet me. That didn't bother me; lots
of people visit my dressing room after performances. Me and the South
African performers I was working with that night thought it rather funny
that we had a royal groupie. She's a bit stiff but she's a nice old
lady. Let me make it clear: I have nothing against her or the royal
family. It is the institution of the monarchy that I loathe so very
much, the monarchy that still refuses to apologise for sanctioning
slavery.

There is a part of me that hopes that after writing this article I shall
never be considered as a Poet Laureate or an OBE sucker again. Let this
put an end to it. This may lose me some of my writing friends; some
people may never want to work with me again, but the truth is I think
OBEs compromise writers and poets, and laureates suddenly go soft - in
the past I've even written a poem, Bought and Sold, saying that.

There are many black writers who love OBEs, it makes them feel like they
have made it. When it suits them, they embrace the struggle against the
ruling class and the oppression they visit upon us, but then they join
the oppressors' club. They are so easily seduced into the great house of
Babylon known as the palace. For them, a wonderful time is meeting the
Queen and bowing before her presence.

I was shocked to see how many of my fellow writers jumped at the
opportunity to go to Buckingham Palace when the Queen had her "meet the
writers day" on July 9 2002, and I laughed at the pathetic excuses
writers gave for going. "I did it for my mum"; "I did it for my kids";
"I did it for the school"; "I did it for the people", etc. I have even
heard black writers who have collected OBEs saying that it is "symbolic
of how far we have come". Oh yes, I say, we've struggled so hard just to
get a minute with the Queen and we are so very grateful - not.

I've never heard of a holder of the OBE openly criticising the monarchy.
They are officially friends, and that's what this cool Britannia project
is about. It gives OBEs to cool rock stars, successful businesswomen and
blacks who would be militant in order to give the impression that it is
inclusive. Then these rock stars, successful women, and ex-militants
write to me with the OBE after their name as if I should be impressed.
I'm not. Quite the opposite - you've been had.

Writers and artists who see themselves as working outside the
establishment are constantly being accused of selling out as soon as
they have any kind of success. I've been called a sell-out for selling
too many books, for writing books for children, for performing at the
Royal Albert Hall, for going on Desert Island Discs, and for appearing
on the Parkinson show. But I want to reach as many people as possible
without compromising the content of my work.

What continues to be my biggest deal with the establishment must be my
work with the British Council, of which, ironically, the Queen is
patron. I have no problem with this. It has never told me what to say,
or what not to say. I have always been free to criticise the government
and even the council itself. This is what being a poet is about. Most
importantly, through my work with the council I am able to show the
world what Britain is really about in terms of our arts, and I am able
to partake in the type of political and cultural intercourse which is
not possible in the mainstream political arena. I have no problem
representing the reality of our multiculturalism, which may sometimes
mean speaking about the way my cousin Michael died in a police station.
But then, I am also at ease letting people know that our music scene is
more than what they hear in the charts, and that British poetry is more
than Wordsworth, or even Motion. I have no problem with all of this
because this is about us and what we do. It is about what happens on the
streets of our country and not in the palace or at No 10.

Me, OBE? Whoever is behind this offer can never have read any of my
work. Why don't they just give me some of those great African works of
art that were taken in the name of the empire and let me return them to
their rightful place? You can't fool me, Mr Blair. You want to privatise
us all; you want to send us to war. You stay silent when we need you to
speak for us, preferring to be the voice of the US. You have lied to us,
and you continue to lie to us, and you have poured the working-class
dream of a fair, compassionate, caring society down the dirty drain of
empire. Stick it, Mr Blair - and Mrs Queen, stop going on about the
empire. Let's do something else.

This is a fabulous piece, which sends an international message.  It is a
beautifully-constructed picture of how any of us, in any culture, can be
coopted into the "in fashion" or "in control" culture.  The isolation of
an artist, who almost by definition must stand outside the culture to see
what others miss, also carries the burden of loneliness.  When that
isolation is compounded by a history of being outside the dominant
culture, the temptations can be even greater.  Zephaniah, of course, is a
wonderful writer.  But, what I particularly treasure, as I read his
article on this US Thanksgiving Day, is his wise depiction of the hows
and whys of selling out.

Not only in writing, but as he points out so well, in any endeavor which
attempts to bring left-out people into privileged society as full members
(not tolerated or special guests), the same dangers occur.  I have been
involved, for years, in family violence research and family violence
programs.  This danger was identified decades ago, but I have never heard
it said as well as Zephaniah said it today.  His piece and his poem
should be on the wall of every social activist's office or home.

Be very careful.  If you get invited to the (in the case of family
violence) legislative table, make sure you don't pay for your invitation
by compromising your purpose.  If you celebrate your position by
requesting only what you have determined your hosts will accept instead
of the justice your friends demand, you will betray your goals, and your
presence "inside" will be useless, perhaps even harmful.  Can't you hear
it?  What are you (Blacks, Native Americans, women) complaining about?
We have included your leaders in our legislative sessions and they have
endorsed our further denial of your basic rights.  Just happened again
with AARP and drugs.

Nice.

My experience of the drug onset was more trauma than visual.  I felt
assaulted by the separation from my suddenly former self and beaten up
by the memory of what a difficult person I had become.  Smacked in the
emotional face.  It was a needed smack.

I think for everyone it's acutely different.  Before January I'd get all
of this pent up frustration and anger and start writing.  By placing my
anger and frustration into an art and a performative space it kept the
anger and frustration from entering my personal life--the art helped
keep it impersonal.  While the energy swings are due to the bipolar
rhythms, the anger and frustration were due to a feeling of being
cheated, that two of my closest best friends had died in accidents, much
too young and much too gifted for me to bear in my life.  But when
another best friend died, committed suicide in January, well, at this
point, three of my five best friends in the world dead, and one from
suicide, and always my own specter of suicide looming in the bipolar
wings, I began to get angry in my personal life.  I had lost so much of
my life in grieving for the other two friends that I decided that I
would not let myself get depressed.  So by forcing down the sadness up
popped real anger.  My wife walked on eggshells around me.  I was
constantly grumbling about things quite petty, bitching about how clean
something was, or how someone was an asshole.  The moment the drugs
kicked in that just stopped altogether.  Everything looked the same, but
it no longer felt the same.

In some ways I see less colors.  I would say your description reminds me
more of coming out of a steep depression about a decade ago.  Where
everything was flat and then suddenly full of color.

Thanks,
P

How do I explain:

"I
think they are in some way the same thing, or, rather, that creativity
is a
subset of productivity.  Creativity is in my mind imaginative (or
sometimes
absent-minded or even self-abandoned)
production: the product is what's being created, whereas imagining
something
creative is not quite, well, creating much of anything.  I can imagine a
trip to the sun but in doing so in some sense I'm not exactly
*creating* a trip to the sun."

Hmm.  I can draw a contrast with my day job-work as a software
developer, or as a student in information science.  I don't conjure up
some sort of problem to solve: the problem presented to me is in a sense
real, tangible, that has direct consequences for people around it.  Art
is literally and figuratively a form of lying; the imagination conjures
some false representation of another thing, and that other thing need
not be real.  That's what I mean by imaginative.  Something is
imaginative if it comes from fantastic & artful rendering of things
regardless of those things' correspondence with "the real world."

But to be honest, in creative production, at least for me, quite often
very little is actually being imagined in my mind's eye.  Sometimes it
all sort of just happens regardless of me, in a big sense.

 'creativity is a subset of productivity' I can see that. Although when
'imagination /imaginative' is added in
We're into a jargon I want  to avoid; it relates to alien kinds of
poetics
more than to my own, and to what people who do not make art (like
psychiatrists, for instance) think art-making, or art knowledge is. But
then
I know almost nothing about mental 'ill-health' so maybe these terms are
usefully deployed in relation to its inter-connections with writing.
Can
'creativity' in particular be refurbished as a meaningful concept
through
them?

This is a personal "report from the trenches" sort of post, in case it
helps enrich the discussion of biPolar issues and creativity ...  I am
picking up the matter of Seasonal Affective Disorder and Clinical
Depression, both of which I've been diagnosed with.

I have suffered a low-to-severe grade depression every autumn for as
long as I can remember, generally lasting till about February,
sometimes beginning as early as mid-August.  Some years, I believed I
was suffering a low-grade depression year-round, but with a heightened
vulnerability and sense of immobility in the autumn.  I went in for
medication and talk-therapy twice -- once when I was 17 years old and
once when I was about 23 (both were less-than-rigorous attempts to
treat the illness).  I maintained a great deal of skepticism for the
following 10 years until that skepticism abruptly decreased this fall.
Patterns came to light and certain real-world situations agitated my
autumn friend to the degree that I have begun an intense regime of
medication, exercise, and talk-therapy.  I hope to start yoga soon as
well.

For me, sustained bursts of creative production have tended to
immediately precede the more severe depressive episodes.  Nothing gets
done within them, vis-a-vis art-making.  On the other hand, and
especially when in "denial" or when believing the illness can be
tackled by "will-power" (which now seems to me an idea the illness
itself produces as a "symptom"), I can trace certain thematic
connections in my work (not so much the process) to the insidious
persistence of low-grade depression and the detrimental effects of
developing a career and sense of self, relationships, etc., in light of
the denial.  People get hurt and the illness gets the upper hand.
Whether this makes the work produced in that light more or less
valuable to myself or others, I can't say.  I am skeptical, however,
that engaging in creative production while in denial can ever be
usefully detached from that denial.  In other words, I am currently
trying to recalibrate my whole sense of the relationship of subject to
subjectivity in poetics.  That is, when I can do more than writhe
around in bed sobbing.

That said, at this point, I'm sick to death of I-me-mine ... Part of
the difficulty of the illness as I understand it is that it severely
shrinks the arena in which one can exercise their desires (insofar as
one can retain a desire for something) and recognize and appreciate
love.

  I was listening this afternoon to Ives' Thanksgiving from his Holidays
Symphony when I remembered this poem that I wrote on an incredibly cold
Thanksgiving in the mountains west of Northampton Massachussets in I think
1976.  I almost never write anything apt for an occasion, so I thought I'd
pass this along.

A MEDITATION ON CHARLES IVES
In 1926 Ives bought the house at 164 East 74th Street, which was their New
York home for the rest of his life, with the music  room on the top floor.
Not long  after they'd moved

                                                                 in--as
Harmony recalled--"he came downstairs
one day with tears in his eyes, and said he couldn't seem to compose
anymore--nothingwent well, nothing sounded right." From then on he revised
and got old sketches in shape.

It's easy to be indignant about what neglect did to him
to guess what twenty years of singing with no one listening
like what Williams said   who also
almost died of exhaustion   that you die
for lack of it    until one day he comes downstairs
broken
by the strain of affirming
while the country hardens around you
even the leaves stiffening in polluted sunlight
another war and another
men who hate their lives thrown at each other for a moment's transcendence
and an ideal    patriotism
that you constantly fought back to an earlier version of
to the 44 who had survived the first winter and the first harvest
hardly a village    a remnant    a community
of scarecrows,
and the leaves fall and you bury the dead
ice cases the graveyard
the forest empty
not even Indians. You plant corn you kill birds   the leaves
for a moment    the flesh of the world, radiant. You pluck your harvest
the leaves die    you huddle by the fire and praise the warmth.
After that
America as the place for the pure choice
is over    the primitive church
as always the only church.
They were dropped
in a howling wilderness? The whole city howls around you.
You have to stuff your ears to make music.

I don't know if I have any overt illness; after the mess at Florida Inte-
rnational and for the first time I began taking anti-depressants, ending
with lexapro. My depressions are furious and just beneath the surface;
they're triggered by - among other things - external factors such as mass
animal/plant extinctions, my inability to support myself at this point,
lack of community acceptance; they're triggered by - among other things -
external factors such as my family background, obsessive-compulsive neuro-
physiologies, extreme insomnia and violent nightmares, the holocaust of
daily life, the truth of the fasco-fundamentalist regime we're subjected
to, real and unreal illnesses, the feeling that death is close at hand;
they're triggered by - among other things - external factors such as my
current readings and writings, the drive of ambition and the drive towards
eternity; they're triggered by - among other things - external factors
such as the constant desire to reveal the truth, to bear witness, to be as
good as I can with Azure, to help others whenever I can, my memories which
are always incriminating, my regrets which begin at birth, my guilt
descending to the very essence of life, my inordinate fear of the false
teething and truths of the absolute, the abyss, a journey forgotten upon
its completion - upon the instant of its completion - so much bandwidth;
they're triggered by - among other things - external factors such as the
enormous waste of it all, the exhaustion that comes with the constant
pretense towards meaning, the long unraveling.

I am a boy afraid of losing writing.

SLEEPY BRAIN PHASE III: 360 DEGREES -- WOMEN IN SOUND
http://www.sleepybrain.net/360.html
********************************

360 Degrees: Women In Sound was held as part of this year's Liquid
Architecture, the national sound art festival run by the ((tRansMIT))
collective. According to curators Arnya Tehira and Sianna Lee, 360 Degrees
was inspired by the need to address a perceived gender imbalance within the
sound art community. It consisted of two separate exhibitions and a live
sound performance, exploring short and long form composition, quadraphonic
installation, sound sculpture and the relationship between sound, video and
digital media.

Sleepy Brain is pleased to rehouse the soundtrack/video component of 360
Degrees as a way of keeping this work before the public. Our
presentation is
in two parts:

* an interview with Arnya Tehira
* a 360 Degrees video gallery, featuring the work of Ai Yamamoto, Bec
Charlesworth, Cat Hope, Cassandra Tytler, Camilla Hannan, Jasmine Guffond,
Anne-Marie Kohn, Claire Conroy, Jean Poole, Louise Terry, Jennifer
Sochackyj, Geoff Robinson and Sally Blenheim

Hello most loving person alan alan whom I have known it seems forever. Do
you remember the first time... Remember when you called on me... Well... I
am still here trying to help you! I hate to give up on you! When you
requested information I promised to help you. I know that information will
be very helpful to your lifestyle and skills set. But more important, I
know that it will be very important to you and Azure and Azure and Azure
and Azure and Azure5 and will be very important to her lifestyle and
skills set. I know you 5 can be very happy together. I will help make you
very happy but you must let me make you very happy. On my own and by
myself I cannot make you very happy well can I. Of course not. Do you
remember when you called on me for... Well I still want to help you. But I
can't help you unless you want me to help you. Then I can send you people.
I can't do anything unless you allow me to send you people.

I really hate to give up on you!

It is so easy for me to help you  5. I am sure Azure and Azure and Azure
and Azure and Azure5 want me to help you. Please let me help you write
now. It's ridiculous but I can't help you unless you let me help you will
you let me help you. Do you know how absurd this is? You must let me help
you.

I haven't given up on you  5 and you 6. I so much want to help you. I was
born to help you with your life style and skillset. Well I still do want
that.

Patrick, Alan -

I was diagnosed when I was 22 (1993) and refused to take Lithium when it was offered...I convinced my doc to prescribe Prozac instead.  I did not want to be dopey in the drugged sense and had an acquaintance who went on it and suddenly became "out of it."  I hadn't yet had any true manic states at that point, though I did clearly have a history of some hypomania.   Other than two separate year-long stints on Prozac, I "controlled" my illness over the last decade with diet (high protein, limited caffeine, & no sugar) and exercise.  For the first 5 years I thought of it as no different than depression.  The last five years (since my first full manic episode) I realized the difference and was able to control the disease to the extend that I could manipulate the timing of upcycle onsets and do breathing exercises to "center" myself and stop the racing thoughts.

Frankly, the entire time the illness controlled me: my exercise regularity (or irregularity) would vary with the swings, as would my mood and artistic production.  So wqould my weight: it would swing an average of 20-30 lbs each year.  Everything swarmed around the epicenter of the disease.  I would never have recognized this were it not for the introduction of Lamictal.  One sort of happy consequence: I don't drink much at all any more.  I didn't make a conscious effort to stop drinking; after all I didn't need to stop.  I'm not at all opposed to a good drunk.  But I did need it in a way at the end of a long week, when my energies were surging: alcohol would calm me down.  I always seemed sober to friends when drinking, because it brought me down to a "normal" state.  Nothing like a six pack on a Friday evening to put it all together or forget it entirely.

The greatest benefit of treatment is my memory.  In the last year the disease was devastating to my memory.  It was eroding rapidly.  I had become almost paralyzingly absent-minded.  Someone would say something to me and I would immediately forget it.  In one ear out the other.  I would misplace things constantly.  That trend has subsided.

I too am a boy afraid of losing the writing, but I am more afraid of blowing my brains out.  It's not that I am particlularly afraid of dying.  I'm not afraid.  I'm somewhat curious, actually.  What I am afraid of is leaving my partner a widow at such a young age, of giving my parents the awful pain of having to outlive me, of ditching the few true close friends I have left, of not completing the things I am here to do.

I never exactly wanted to be a writer; most days I loathe it as it feels like a weight around my neck, a compulsion, a burden, an addiction.  Wanting to be a writer: I have friends who really desire that lifestyle, that image, The Writer.  I just don't understand why someone would go out of their way for it.  My drive is more akin to Alan's: there's a quiet desire to "live forever" through the writing.  There's much more to it, but that's a part of it, perhaps as a reaction to the death of young friends.  After all, if I'm going to be stuck writing so much, something good might as well come out of it.  I find it interesting that people who want to be writers generally shouldn't write.  It's the wrong reason to write, particularly when it comes to poetry.  You gotta imitate the work you love and then write the things you need to read, the things you can't find anywhere else.  I just can't help it.  That itch is still in me, fortunately, but it has changed.

When you're dead you can't write at all.  But certainly when I first went on the drugs I was afraid of losing the writing.  I felt a sense of pride, a sort of artificial inflation of the ego as the list of publications and completed books quickly amassed.  It became part of me and I didn't want to lose that.  But I did and do dream about leaving poetry for 20, 30, 40 years.  I've written enough for a couple of lifetimes, and I can't continue to write because my ego is attached to it.

My desires are decidedly less grandiose, and I suspect my "successes" will be less grandiose as well.  It's not so bad to seem less important & to not worry so much about trying to control the things I have no business controlling.

Yeah , showing and appreciating love, I agree completely.

Patrick

Part of
the difficulty of the illness as I understand it is that it severely
shrinks the arena in which one can exercise their desires (insofar as
one can retain a desire for something) and recognize and appreciate
love.

Below is an article from this morning's Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel about
police misconduct at the FTAA. Tom Hayden also wrote about his personal

Protesters contend Miami police abused them, stepped on their civil rights

By Diana Marrero
Miami Bureau
Posted November 28 2003


MIAMI -- A longtime Miami lawyer says police shot her in the back with
rubber bullets as she walked away from officers in riot gear.
A 63-year-old man says police arrested him as he was trying to leave a
demonstration.
A reporter says she was ordered to the ground, handcuffed and arrested for
walking down the street.

While activists continue to document what they say was a disturbing pattern
of police abuse during last week's anti-globalization demonstrations, more
stories are emerging from protesters and others who say their civil rights
were violated.

Activists say police stopped, detained and threatened hundreds of
protesters; placed dozens of people and a few of their gathering spots under
surveillance; and arrested many more demonstrators who were simply
exercising their right to free speech. They say police used the need to deal
with a small group of disruptive protesters to stifle dissent by thousands
of others who came to Miami to speak out against the Free Trade Area of the
Americas meeting.

The allegations in Miami come when some members of Congress are calling for
hearings into an FBI bulletin sent to more than 17,000 state and local
police agencies last month, urging authorities to report suspicious behavior
at anti-war protests to the FBI.

The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups say the bulletin raises
concerns that the FBI might return to the abuses of the 1960s and 1970s,
when its agents gathered intelligence intended to neutralize anti-Vietnam
War protesters, civil rights demonstrators and other dissenters.

"Our country is founded on the very fabric of dissent, and it must be
decriminalized," said Naomi Archer, of South Floridians for Fair Trade and
Global Justice.

Miami police officials could not be reached for comment, but they have
repeatedly defended their actions, saying officers showed a tremendous
amount of restraint during the anti-globalization protests. Miami-Dade
police officials also praised their officers.

To dispute the police claims, activists played a video at a recent news
conference that showed police clashing with demonstrators, firing pepper
spray and rubber bullets -- indiscriminately, activists say -- at the crowds
last week.

The video also captured footage of Miami lawyer Elizabeth Ritter, who stood
peacefully in front of a row of officers in black riot gear with a sign
meant to protest what she saw as the creation of a police state in her
hometown, not the trade talks. The sign read: "Fear Totalitarianism."

A short time later, Ritter was hit by at least five rubber bullets as she
walked away from officers. One hit her in the back of the head while she
crouched behind her sign.

"Never in a million years did it occur to me that my police department would
hurt me or much less shoot me in the back," Ritter said.

Allan Taylor, a retired pharmacist and lawyer from Delray Beach, said
officers corralled him and a group of others conducting a vigil for jailed
demonstrators, preventing them from complying with an earlier police order
that they leave the area. Taylor, 63, was charged with unlawful assembly and
resisting arrest without violence.

Celeste Fraser Delgado, a reporter with the Miami New Times, also was
arrested last week. She was charged with failure to obey a lawful command
and resisting arrest without violence, despite her assertions that she
followed the arresting officers' orders. The charges were later dropped.

Amnesty International, union leaders and other activists are asking for an
independent investigation into the mounting allegations of police abuse.

They include Brenna Bell, an Oregon-based attorney with the National Lawyers
Guild, who claims she was arrested while trying to obey police orders to
disperse from a peaceful demonstration.

"If this is homeland security," she said, "I'm not feeling very secure."

Information from The Associated Press was used to supplement this report.

Inspired by Patrick, I propose a short group poem for which contributors =
contribute 1 line descriptive of their own crying.  The line should be as =
tightly focussed on and as accurate to autobiographical crying and =
personal crying style as possible.  I'm not satisfied with my own =
contribution below but having slept on it would prefer to see if this poem =
can get made than come up with a better line right now anyway.  Contributor=
s can contribute as many times as they like; I'll put the poem together =
if/when I have enough contributions.  I hope enough people/poets/criers =
will contribute for a short group poem to sprout.

Hi Lori,

thanks for your response. Good to hear that lines between all of us
contributing feedback are converging, with the directions that you all
producing the newsletter are drawn towards taking, rather than crossing.

My additional dime's-worth would be to encourage a regularly updated site
with a distinctive archive, as distinct from a blog.

Further to heap praise upon you, as a student body, for wanting to broaden
the range of contexts, venues and writer-readership boundaries considered to
be part of the Poetics Program.

way to go

love and love
cris

Patrick and Patrick, your writing is eloquent here; I would very much like
to see an anthology with texts such as these, perhaps Tom Bell, perhaps
everyone. I just picked up Caitlin Thomas's Leftover Life to Kill - she
was Dylan's widow - and it seems apropos as well.

With drugs, I try to leave the lexapro - I'm also worried about the
obsessive-compulsive problems I've had since the debacle at Florida
International. I wish I could sue them; the job was falsely advertised,
and I collapsed under their repeated lies.

You can see where this might be going.

Lexapro stops the regurgitation. It pushes the rest of me out, expels me
into text. That's not bad. All the other drugs to be honest frighten me;
I've seen bad addictions among my friends and others.

I get addicted to operating systems, which isn't bad. I just installed Red
Hat linux 9 on an older desktop and it flows. I'm allowed to explore
worlds from inside and out.

And _now_ depression seems reasonable, necessary. How can one possibly
live in peace - knowing that at least one species is extinct because of
human activity? And we're destroying the world at the rate of three or
foure species PER HOUR!

One either adopts a detached or buddhist attitude - we do what we can, the
etiology of suffering, etc. - or one collapses. I wander between the
poles. There's a disease here that is killing pigeons; their legs become
paralyzed, collapse. They can't fly. They can think clearly, their eyes
are bright. I'm positive its related to the enormously polluted
environment they live in. Most urban pigeons live two years at the most. I
walk down streets to avoid the wounded. I can't do anything. It's
constant. The degree of pain is overwhelming. We're raping the planet,
we're raping ourselves.

I can't argue this theoretically. There's no reason for any species to
remain alive - no ultimate meaning, ultimate reason. We make these up as
we go along; Tertullian was right, the first existentialist.

The difficulty is writing OUT of oneself while IN oneself. That's the
miracle, if there is one. One advantage of code/extreme/experimental work
is the surprise. It's a small surprise but it's almost always there. A
relief, a better drug.

- Alan

Inspired by Patrick, I propose a short group poem for which contributors
contribute 1 line descriptive of their own crying.  The line should be as
tightly focussed on and as accurate to autobiographical crying and personal
crying style as possible.  I'm not satisfied with my own contribution below
but having slept on it would prefer to see if this poem can get made than
come up with a better line right now anyway.  Contributors can contribute as
many times as they like; I'll put the poem together if/when I have enough
contributions.  I hope enough people/poets/criers will contribute for a
short group poem to sprout.

A Thanksgiving Prayer


For John Dillinger, in the hope that he is still alive.
(Thanksgiving Day, November 28th 1986)

Thanks for the wild turkey and the passenger pigeons,
        destined to be shit out through wholesome American guts.
Thanks for a continent to despoil and poison.
Thanks for Indians to provide a modicum of challenge and danger.
Thanks for vast herds of bison to kill and skin, leaving the carcasses to rot.
Thanks for bounties on wolves and coyotes.
Thanks for the American Dream - to vulgarize and falsify until the bare
        lies shine through.
Thanks for the K.K.K.
For nigger-killing lawmen feeling their notches.
For decent, church-going women with their mean, pinched, bitter evil faces.
Thanks for Kill A Queer For Christ stickers.
Thanks for laboratory AIDS.
Thanks for prohibition, and the war against drugs.
Thanks for a country where nobody is allowed to mind his own business.
Thanks for a nation of finks.
Yes, thanks for all the memories - "Alright, let's see your arms."
You always were a headache and you always were a bore.
Thanks, for the last and greatest betrayal, of the last and greatest of
        human dreams...

--William S. Burroughs

i am the writing for this tree.
i am standing here day and am standing here night.
i am standing in storm and in sunlight.
i am standing in snow and in fog and in thaw.
i have never seen the other side of the hill.
i have no idea what is on the other side.
i can't see into the ground unless a squirrel digs a very wide hole.
i can't move to escape the squirrel who is busy with me.
i can't move closer to hear anything on the other side of the hill.
since i am blind perhaps there is no hill.
perhaps there is no squirrel.
when the great winds come i cannot protect myself.
i can only hope and can only hope when the great fires come.
when i lose a part of myself i do not lose the whole.
i am not sure when i lose a part of myself but i am sometimes
strengthened.
i cannot tell what is happening around me nor avoid the axe.
i cannot huddle or mourn and cannot tell you about my children.
if any of them should live. i cannot speak.
i am writing this gift for my friend the tree which is outside my window.
my friend cannot hear me and cannot see me.
these many years. my friend has not known me.
i am writing for my tree which cannot read.

Material Worlds: At the Intersections of Print and Material Culture
University of Toronto=20
April 24th, 2004


We invite proposals for papers and complete panel presentations for a =
colloquium on the multiple intersections of book history, print culture =
and material culture. Expanding on Roger Darnton's comment that book =
history is "interdisciplinarity run riot," the organizers invite =
emerging scholars from any discipline to submit proposals that approach =
the material dimensions of recent work in the field of book history and =
print culture studies.=20

"Material World" follows on the success of the "New Scholarship in Book =
History and Print Culture" conference that took place in October 2002 =
and was sponsored by the Collaborative Program in Book History and Print =
Culture at the University of Toronto. "Material World" will be held at =
the University on April 24th 2004.

Keynote speaker: Janice Radway.=20

Please send submissions to Archana Rampure at =
archana.rampure@utoronto.ca, consisting of an abstract (no more than 250 =
words) and a one-page CV, preferably in the body of the text. The =
deadline for submissions is 15th December 2003.

In this week's Chronicle of Higher Education, Stanley Fish has an article about the
coming assault on academia.  I'm not sure if you need a password to open the
article.  Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't.  He basically says the same thing I
was trying to say a few weeks ago, except he continues to tell his crazy lies about
supply-side hiring.  Whoever's there, gets hired.  It's extremely tough to land any
kind of job in academia.  Also, the jobs that he implies are there aren't there.
There are no jobs teaching contemporary poetry.  Out of over 1000 posts this year,
to be honest, there were two.  Now it may be possible to teach contemporary poetry
if you are a poet and are hired in a creative writing position.  But in terms of
scholarship, this field simply no longer exists.  Or I should say -- there were two
jobs posted.  One was in San Diego, and stipulated that one had to be working within
economic studies of literary production, and the other was in Utah.

I'm not looking for a job by the way.  I have one, and am a bit over the hill at
47.  I can't compete with the new people with fresh parchment.  I'm going to melt
away in these hills rather happily, as long as the state system can afford it.

I'm just worried a tsunami is headed this way.

The right wants teaching to be subordinate to business concerns, or as the ultimate
Calvinist Calvin Coolidge puts it, "Business is the business of America."

I guess English departments can be made to teach business memos, and technical
writing.

I'm interested in a surrealist critique of both the Marxist left and the Calvinist
right.  And the possibility therefore of caprice.

Here's the Fish article, which I think is just going to draw more ire from the
right, as it's totally dishonest:

http://chronicle.com/jobs/2003/11/2003112601c.htm

My links don't ever work, but miracles occasionally take place.

I've been moved by many of the responses to this thread...

I also have manic depression, and I recognize in myself much of what =
Patrick and David and others have discussed, but unlike Patrick, I CAN'T =
write when manic.  The ideas bounce off the insides of my head like =
pinballs with an almost audible clinking, and I don't have time to =
"hear" them, let alone to write them down.  Lesser degrees of mania, =
while they can can free the flow of ideas, inhibit critical thinking so =
that one is unable to judge the quality of one's output.  This leads to =
long hours spent on things which are simply not worth the time or =
effort.

But really, mania has not been my problem.  I have been psychotically =
manic on about three or four occassions, I've taken drugs, and gotten =
better.  What is really a personal and artistic problem is depression, =
which in me is almost untreatable and leads to near-catatonic states.  =
Needless to say I do not write during them.  Often, I cannot read.  Or =
else, I can only read books I have already read, because a new book is =
over-stimulating.

For me, drugs are a necessity but they do not work very well.  On the =
other hand, they have not robbed me of my creativity, mainly because I =
refuse to take anything which kills my ability to write and programs =
etc., and my doctor agrees with me on this point.  I suppose I would =
choose a dull, uncreative life over a life of severe depression, but =
with me I'm either uncreative AND depressed,  or creative and more or =
less well.

A more artistic response to my illness can be found on my website =
www.sporkworld.org along with assorted other web art and poetry.

re: the blog piece

- this was designed with no one whatsoever in mind

only to point out the dangers and communications in a public space
and the closures inherent in a private public space

- too many people took this directed at them - it was directed at no one
at all -

Under construction, and available to pre-view at the sites below, despite
the scaffolding, is the 3rd edition of 'A Chide's Alphabet'. Contributors
include Andrew Duncan, Sheila Murphy, Peter Riley, Patrick Herron, Mark
Weiss, Harriet Zinnes, Douglas Barbour, Karlien van den Breukel, Paul
Croucher and Angela Gardner and more, including its rapidly ageing and
square-eyed editor. There is a particular emphasis on translated material
from the German and the Dutch, the German material being supplementary to
that recently published in the US. Safety helmets are recommended while
exploring the site till building work is completed.

Now can someone explain to me the relationship between this quote & the
use of Viagra?  Erections are a pleasure which is void of wisdom?
Every generation has its secret wisdom passed on to it in different
ways, perhaps I've been ignoring spam's revolutionary role in changing
society.

PUB: call for papers--caribbean childhood stories
=======================================

The 9th International Conference of ACWWS: Liberatory Poetics in Caribbean

Writing: Gender and Nation Re-Configurations, Santo Domingo, Dominican

Republic, April 26-30, 2004.


Panel title: The Caribbean Childhood Story


This panel seeks to put together papers addressing how Caribbean childhood

stories engage with questions of writing and the formation of subjectivity

under colonial regimes of power.  Beginning with Joseph Zobel's La rue

Cases-Nègres  in the 1950s, coming-of-age narratives have figured

prominently in Caribbean fiction.  Authors such as George Lamming, Raphael

Confiant, Patrick Chamoiseau, Jamaica Kincaid, and Michelle Cliff have

produced childhood stories which have become the object of close critical

scrutiny both inside and outside the region. This wide critical interest

provides an indication of what the childhood story as a genre can

offer.  Not only are childhood stories privileged sites for the re-creation

of memory through writing, but they allow for an innocentinquiry into the

nature of history and domesticity.  In this way, the subgenre affords a

vantage point from which larger issues may be addressed, issues such as

collective memory and identity, the role of culture and education in the

formation of identities, the negotiation of and between languages, the

demarcation of private and public spheres, racial and gender

identifications, as well as the configuration of colonial subjectivities.

Sorry for the length of the post, but you have to pay if you want to read
this from the NYTimes archives, so...

Spam I Am
By SPARROW

PHOENICIA, N.Y. =8B Am I the only person who celebrates spam?

I remember the first unsolicited commercial e-mail message (otherwise known
as spam) I received. It began with a friendly greeting: "Hello Sparquee." I=
t
went on to offer me various drugs like Valium and Viagra, "no prescription
needed." The name Sparquee was a total surprise, but it made sense. It
combines my name, Sparrow, with that harpooner from "Moby Dick," Queequeg.

I began to keep a list of these delightful salutations: HI, Mseligman; Hell=
o
Soowee; Hello Snaper; flyingscot1; Hello Smorrison23; Tjhedrick; Hey there
Deblack; Hey There Zett; Fparente; Souciep; healthslif; Sparrott1; Hi!
Fariel aWagothea; Sparrish3; Sowders; vale; Spgross; icq; Chakkaboy, now is
the time; Howdy Sparrow1257ss; Sparma1, you decide; Hello Sparkinson; Dear
serge101; Hi rhino6; Dear silverpepper; Dear soggyloafr; Dear sonman2;
Dgosch; Chukkaboy, PbUO; Tlyowbken.

I love these names =8B temporary, awkward, apt. They seem expressive of my
inner selves. Sparky799 is my party personality; Souciep is my suave,
artistic persona. Soowee, though mildly insulting (it is a call for pigs),
is my abrasive side. Sparlin combines my name with that of my hero, Abraham
Lincoln.

My given name is Michael, which in Hebrew means "who is like God" and was
originally applied to an angel. My last name, Gorelick, in Russian, is
related to being in a fire. One of the most successful musicians in history
has this last name =8B and also doesn't use it: Kenny G.

Despite my spiritually instructive name, I have long endeavored to change
it. In high school, I renamed myself Swarmy Nud Myrtle, but no one paid
attention. In college, I changed my name to Mike Hotel (the first year) and
Mike Motel (the second). But neither one felt right.

So I asked a friend to rename me (she wore long dresses, and sometimes a
snood, making her look like a Tarot card come to life). "You be Sparrow; yo=
u
look like a sparrow," she said. (Years later she said, "I thought I was jus=
t
naming you for that day.")

At first I was impressed by the justness of my name. I was born in
Manhattan, surrounded by sparrows. As a child walking to school, I admired
these birds nesting above a Chinese laundry on Nagle Avenue. Like all New
York City children, I believed sparrows were baby pigeons. (This was becaus=
e
we saw only two species of birds, and pigeons zealously hid their squabs.)

When did I lose faith in the name Sparrow? Probably around 1980. It is, for
one thing, a wimpy word. Who wants to share a name with a beady-eyed
low-flying little bird? Even in the Bible, God sees every sparrow fall. How
ominous. Why can't God see every sparrow thrive? Or sing?

By adopting a single name, Sparrow, I had disconnected myself from my
family, my lineage, my Jewish (and Russian) ethnicity. But after a few
years, the name began to accumulate its own history. Again I was weighed
down by a burdensome identity.

This is the problem with names. They can never liberate us, because they
take on our personality. It would be best if we could have a new name every
day, based on our mood and disposition. Thanks to spam, this is now
possible.

Spam has been blamed for everything from a decline in worker productivity t=
o
a drop in business profitability. It has been called a threat to our privac=
y
=8B and even to our safety. But to me, spam is far less nefarious. It can be
awakening.=20

I don't usually feel like a Michael, a Mike Motel or a Sparrow. But somehow
I do feel like a Snaper, a Sparrish3, a Dgosch, and especially a Fariel
aWagothea. These names are hints of some inner transformation. Today, I am
Sparker14, like a sparkler, throwing off sparks in 14 directions.

Sparrow, a poet, is author, most recently, of "Yes, You Are a
Revolutionary!" (Soft Skull Press).

Hi Joe,

The most offensive stroke to me was his assertion that conservatives
wouldn't want to teach modern poetry or Byzantine history.  He's
pretending that these rather complex subjects still exist when they no
longer do -- what is being taught is ethnic studies by monoglot
multiculturals.  He knows that and so do the conservatives.  Last night
on C-span the Intercollegiate Studies Institute was on for several
hours.  This is an incredible organization with a war chest in excess of
50 million dollars.  They have published a best-selling book called
Choosing the Right College --  (Eerdman's 2000) which has sold over a
million copies.  The book lists 108 schools around the country of which
the only two they approve of are Boston University and Grove City.  And
they document for instance that Oberlin had a master's student in music
who blew another student on stage as part of a classical concert.
Almost every school is treated like that -- they are trying to
absolutely infuriate their constituency, and last night was no
different.  It was a war party -- directed entirely at academia.  Some
of the familiar figures were there such as William Buckley (something's
happened to his face and he's starting to look like the Grinch as played
by Jim Carrey -- Lincoln said you finally get the face you deserve).  I
think the right is wrong to want to just teach American values since the
foundation (this seems to be what they keep coming back toward in all
their speeches), but some kind of core of what's important does have to
be hammered out.  The right is arguing that since the advent of women's
studies, etc., that more and more classes are taught on how to
masturbate, and the ethics of fist-fucking.  This has even been in
forums such as Reader's Digest -- which millions read, and the actual
class names, the teachers, and the colleges were listed.  While some of
this is no doubt skewed, I did experience something like this in
graduate school.  And the right is absolutely furious about it.  I get
the feeling that they think that everybody teaching in college is a turd
and that if they don't flush the toilet the country is going to smell
even worse.  I think that somehow academia has to become responsible to
the average tax payer who's footing all of this.  Fish is pretending
that nothing's wrong.  This is going to infuriate the right even worse
because they know that -- at least from their point of view -- academia
has become a stuck toilet, and they're working night and day on a plan.
I sometimes think I am just paranoid -- but here is Stanley Fish saying
that there's a huge problem (which he thinks is purely in the imaginary
of the right).  But that doesn't matter -- it's still a huge problem.
This is going to be the next battleground of the culture wars, and it's
going to be played out in the legal arena, as Fish suggests, but it's
also going to be political -- especially in states with Republican
governors.  Already campuses are being taken to court one after another
for creating tiny free-speech zones -- and one after another the
colleges are losing, and being tagged with fines.  There are hearings in
congress having to do with the lop-sidedness of American academic life.

It's a drag for me because I had hoped that out of the collision of
opposites some kind of civic responsibility would arise where academia
was in some way forced to become accountable to the tax-payers such that
city planning, civic participation, would result.  It's just an inkling
that I hoped was coming to pass.  Instead there's been a kind of ethnic
Balkanization, followed by scapegoating.

Fish's text simply points at the problem, and then denies that it's
true.

The other side denies that there's any problem with repression of
minorities and women.

With both sides denying the other's major claims, and with seemingly no
common ground, I sense a massive war.

Fish's piece is going to be incendiary, I think.  It's going to take a
brave person in power to try to head off this huge collision that's
coming.  It has to be someone with stature, who can be listened to by
both sides.  Perhaps there is no one in America who has that stature.  I
can't think of any middle figures who have the brains and the
imagination to do it.  Or even what forum exists so that the Calvinists
and the Marxists can begin to communicate.  Right now they just seem to
be inflating rhetoric and preparing for slaughter.

But, hey, maybe I'm paranoid.

Mairead, thanks for the humor regarding Blair and Seinfeld.  I need to lighten up.
Whatever is going to happen is going to happen.  It's just a show, anyways, and I am
just a nobody so I probably won't be effected.  It's the giants that go down in show
downs like that.  Me, I'm just absolutely nobody, and thank God!

Also, I too have answered Maria's mails about five times and they all come back.  I
thought this was just my paranoia, but aha it is now confirmed that Maria has got
something the matter with her email.

And what do you think those "American values" are? In my experience those
words are usually invoked to paint the rest of us as "wretched refuse."

This goes back to the flag discussion earlier on this list?  Whose flag is

yeah, it's a drag.  i can only imagine it's someone who's mad at me
for some reason, someone i've accidentally slighted or something
--otherwise, what'd be the point?  if anyone wants to post a
counter-review i'd be most grateful.

The statement that "there are no jobs teaching contemporary poetry" as an
academic subject seems incorrect. Maybe there are no openings, but the job
market is tough all over. Like Vietnam, Iraq is gutting us. As for Fish, I
like him for his guts. His fish guts.

Sonnet:   Autonomous Retreat

That hole, that vacuum, with talk and print--all oil
mergers suspended until further notice. No use to cry
outside and scream inside. It was all a sin click
here, until the storm bursts, and house is shut and still.

We share the luxury of seeing it all, building the scrub
of future sugar. Having lost and forgotten everything,
the music must play forever--allegro, ma non troppo.
Unexplained bravura, place of safe laughter.

On the reasonable shoreline, white in the air, white
in the trees. Father of wavelets, come lift your arms
with us. Given this kind of city, sand beneath our feet
like broken glass, pieces of orphaned wreckage

tossed up by the storm. Russian oil mergers suspended
by thumbs, between wetlands and the suffocating sea.


Hal
