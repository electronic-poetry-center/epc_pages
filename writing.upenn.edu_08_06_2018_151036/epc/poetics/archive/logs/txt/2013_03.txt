Hello Michael,

Since you asked so nicely, Canarium, Green Lantern, Coach House and
House of Anansi are teaming up for this great poetry reading:


* * * *

*Four Presses, No Boundaries: An AWP Off**-Site Event*
American presses Canarium and Green Lantern join forces with Coach House
and House of Anansi

Please join us for a poetry reading that shatters the Canadian-U.S.
border! Two of the best American indie presses (Canarium, Green Lantern)
join forces with two of the best indie presses north of the border
(Coach House, House of Anansi) for an incredible event the first night
of the AWP Conference in Boston.

The four-press showdown takes place at nearby *Dillon's* (955 Boylston
Street) -- it's literally less than a five-minute walk from the Hynes
Convention Center. So if you're not particularly a big fan of walking or
cross-Boston travel, stay in the neighbourhood for some of the best
poetry readings of the AWP!

In the spirit of cross-border literature, we'll feature short readings by:

Joel Craig (/The Whi//te House/, Green Lantern)
Brent Cunningham (/Jou//rney to the Sun/, Atleos)
Jeramy Dodds (/Crabwise to the Hounds/, Coach House)
Andrew Faulkner (/Need Machine/, Coach House)
Anthony Madrid (/I Am Your Slave Now Do What I Say/, Canarium)
Sara Peters (/1996/, House of Anansi)
Adam Sol (/Jeremiah, Ohi//o/, House of Anansi)
Matthew Tierney (/Probably Inevitable/, Coach House)
Nick Twemlow (/Palm Trees/, Green Lantern)
Lynn Xu (/Debts & Lessons/, Omnidawn)

Have a few drinks at the cash bar, talk shop with your fellow writers
and publishers and pick up some killer new books at the book table.
Celebrate with us!

*Schedule**:*

8:45 - short readings by Adam Sol, Andrew Faulkner, Joel Craig, Anthony
Madrid, Matthew Tierney
9:30 - short drink break
9:45 - short readings by Brent Cunningham, Sara Peters, Jeramy Dodds,
Lynn Xu, Nick Twemlow

*Four Presses, No Boundaries*
An AWP Off-Site Event
readings by Joel Craig, Brent Cunningham, Jeramy Dodds, Andrew Faulkner,
Anthony Madrid, Sara Peters, Adam Sol, Matthew Tierney, Nick Twemlow and
Lynn Xu
Thursday, March 7, 2013
Dillon's, 955 Boylston Street
8:30 p.m.
Free!

Hi Michael,


I'm organizing an offsite reading, which I think is going to be great!  It'=
s on Thursday March 7th, at 6:30 and is called Kale Soup for the Soul (poet=
s reading work about family, food and Portuguese culture). It's at the Port=
uguese Consulate and we'll even have refreshments, music and wine. Free and=
 open to the public.


Also I'd recommend checking out the AWP web site (this year they list Publi=
c readings as well as conference events)


Take care

Subject:      Fwd: PQRS, by Patrick Durgin | new from Kenning Editions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

    Announcing the publication of /*PQRS*/
<http://www.kenningeditions.com/pqrs-by-patrick-durgin/>, by Patrick Durgin

*/PQRS/* is a poets theater script with initials for names and functions
for characters. It is about linguistic contagion and statist collusion,
the fate of labor and play as literary genre (i.e. "essay"), the utility
of public art and site-specificity in the post-medium age, the
plasticity of gender, the metaphysics of lyric address, and several
other topics. It was written between 1998 and 2012, mostly toward the
end of that period.

Patrick Durgin <http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/durgin/> is coauthor of
/The Route/ (Atelos, 2008, with Jen Hofer) and has published numerous
chapbooks, including /Imitation Poems/ (2006) and /Color Music/ (2002).
Durgin is also editor of /Hannah Weiner's Open House/
<http://www.kenningeditions.com/hannah-weiners-open-house-by-hannah-weiner/>
and /The Early and Clairvoyant Journals of Hannah Weiner/
<http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/m504/index.html>. He teaches
critical theory, literature, and writing at the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago.

    It's one thing to advocate for writing that pushes boundaries, mixes
    discourses, and transgresses the dominant aesthetic, but it's quite
    another to actually write it.  As a play, /PQRS/ is not just
    unstageable, it is a monumental failure.  That is, it fails with
    such clarity, indifference, legitimate anger, and abandon that it
    turns into a kind of monument, marking the point where the
    intellect's pessimism collapses into the will's optimism.  The many
    models and forerunners for a project this radical include the
    posthumously published texts of Gertrude Stein, referred to
    explicitly here as "the most exhaustive syllabic implosion in prose
    of any language." But if Stein's implosion was horizontal,/ PQRS/
    goes vertical, running up and down the scale of rhetorics: essay,
    drama, lists of potential performance art projects, lit crit, film
    crit, music history, autobiography, back to drama, intermission,
    critique of capital, URL of a Tumblr page of women laughing while
    holding salads, back to drama (and: /scene/).  "The text succeeds
    its own conditions."  In dire and unsuccessful times, that's the hope.

    ---Brent Cunningham

    With a genuine sweep and suspense, /PQRS/ up-ends and pats down
    received ideas of genre, putting its principal characters (the
    eponymous P, Q, R and my own favorite, S) through their paces on an
    imaginary stage in an imaginary play.  Designed not to be acted or
    produced, Durgin calls this work a "script," which I like for its
    straightfoward modesty.  But as I see it, it's first cousin to
    something like the 1930s "essay-novels" of Virginia Woolf, /Orlando
    /or/ The Pargiters/---books written simultaneously in two veins,
    each illuminating the other in unexpected, and here thrilling,
    ways.  Like aging stars, P, Q, R, and S upstage each other,
    disconcert each other, all in the interest of presenting as much
    enlightenment as we can sit for, within the pages of a single book;
    so they form a serious quartet with comic overtones, like the lovers
    and mages of Mozart's "Non ti fidar, O misera."  Don't trust him, O
    sad person!

    ---Kevin Killian

    The "performance" "script" Patrick Durgin imagines in /PQRS/ is not
    so much dramaturgical as sweepingly demiurgical, in the sense that
    it fashions a world out of the chaos of a twenty-first-century
    poet's broad field of experience and association (literary history,
    music and film, economic theory, sculpture, public art, performance
    art, and poetics, to name a few examples). This world is
    inhabitable, if not comfortable: it is a world that resists staging
    in any conventional sense, but whose very conceptual difficulty
    supplies a context for new models of dramatic form and provides a
    vehicle for the kinds of thinking and representing that happen when
    various avant-garde ideologies collide with the twin crises of
    postmodern irony and capitalist recuperation. The tidy serialism
    implied by the title is a feint that dissolves into a frenetic vista
    of spectacular anxieties and social realities. It would be banal to
    confine /PQRS/ under the tired rubric of "cross-genre"; rather, it
    rehearses genre's continuing usefulness as a category and finds it
    wanting.

    ---K. Silem Mohammad

    Reminiscent of Guy Debord's /The Society of the Spectacle/, albeit
    in an intensified and wildly fluid twenty-first century context,
    Patrick Durgin's essay-as-poetics script releases a discursive
    energy typically suppressed in theater. This is a theater of
    compressed time, bursting within the seams of global capital's
    themes. A spooky and illuminating work.

    ---Carla Harryman

    Poet's theater has always pushed the genre boundaries of what is a
    play to a far off horizon. And Patrick Durgin's /PQRS/ is yet
    another example in this tradition. It is more indebted to the
    happening, to philosophy, to essay, to scholarship than it might be
    to the conventions of realist drama. It has demanding, location
    specific production instructions. It lectures without shame about
    art, its economies, its global circulations, its powers. And yet it
    still is full of the powerful exchanges that make drama at moments

*Big Bridge stands, for these last fifteen years, as the premiere and most
 important metazine of the arts. It is both a growing archive of these

flawless and varied, it is bright, meaningful and gener**ous in the breadth
and artistry of presentations. For the writer it is a mark of achievement
to appear in Big Bridge... And it is also the first stop on the web **for
those who want to see what is new and vital.*

and artists for fifteen years.  I wish them another good fifteen."-*Doriann=
e
Laux*, poet and teach, author of *The Book of Men* (W.W. Norton) and *Facts
about the Moon (W.W. Norton)*, is the recipient of the Oregon Book Award
and winner of the Paterson Prize in Poetry

*"Big Bridge* lives up to its name: it has linked poets from around the
globe in a fearless passage from silence to the agora. The struggle for
justice through the agency of poetry is a mighty force: Big Bridge is a
well-aimed spearhead toward that ideal."-*Andrei Codrescu*,

"Big Bridge is, for the digital age, the kind of broad, inclusive, smart
(but never academic), happy / angry journal we have not had in too many
decades. Its antecedents include such stalwarts as Coyote's Journal,
Beatitude, The World or John Sinclair's Work, but Big Bridge demonstrates
the possibilities of life on the web by going much further & deeper than
any one of those publications. Its reach is literally the planet, but I
suspect that if anyone starts sending in writing or art from Mars or
another star system, it would show up in Big Bridge first." -*Ron Silliman*=
,
poet, editor of Silliman's Blog

 "What I find is *Big Bridge* is *the* community of poets without nostalgia
and without pretense.- *Michael Basinski*, Curator, The Poetry Collection
of the University Libraries, University at Buffalo.

*"Big Bridge* is a marvelous resource for the high but often battered,
sometimes financially impoverished art of poetry. It is wide-ranging,
impeccably diverse, historically aware, open to the avant-garde as well as
to formal modes, always intelligent, at times astonishing. It's a magazine
for poets that never forgets its obligation to interest the general
reader-the person for whom poetry is too often out of reach. You'll find
famous poets there, but you'll also find unknown poets-and, importantly,
poets who *will*be known."- *Jack Foley*, poet, critic, KPFA radio host and
editor of acclaimed V*isions & Affiliations: A California Literary Time
Line 1940-2005*

"For fifteen-plus years, *Big Bridge* has kept alive the spirit fo the
marvelous, offering again and again a cornucopia of edgy intensities and
restless beauties that make us recommit to imagination's interventionist
powers."-*Maria Damon*, poet, teacher, author of *The Dark End of the
Street: Margins in American Vanguard Poetry* and *Postliterary America:
From Bagel Shop Jazz to Micropoetries*

*"Big Bridge *provides a wonderful platform for some of the best poetry and

*"Big Bridge *is a unique phenomenon in literature, gathering poets and
writers together from around the globe in a huge, encompassing, and utterly
new view of the latest in letters. Like a migration of monarchs, there is
nothing else like this seminal annual."- *Larissa Shmailo*, poet and
translator

*"Big Bridge* has long been a must-read for anyone occupied by poetry and
art."-Bill *Berkson*, poet, critic, teacher and sometime curator. Poet,
essayist, curator, professor emeritus at the San Francisco Art Institute

*Big Bridge* is more than a literary arts magazine. It's a world wide web
of literary arts experiences. And because of the possibilities of digital
publishing, a reader has instant access to fifteen years of the magazine's
offerings of work by poets and artists from all over the globe. Print
publications simply cannot compete with this kind of immediacy and breadth.
And certainly can't offer such scope at no charge to the reader. But it
takes more than 21st Century technology to create such a terrific literary
arts adventure. It takes vision, poetic intelligence, and a dedication to
the world wide web of poetry (rather than commitment to a small poetic
suburb). There are hazards, however. Once one crosses that *Big Bridge* and
begins to explore the territory, one may not re-emerge for days.-*Barbara
Barg*, poet

*"Big Bridge* is devoted to poetry. The site's tastes are wide and ranging.
From features on master authors like Philip Whalen or Edward Dorn, to new
voices with an array of interests and attitudes toward poetry, *Big Bridge =
*has
it all. Michael Rothenberg's commitment to new writing and to the
traditions of the New American poetry unite at Big Bridge to keep
conversations alive--across place and across time--in the cyberian
interspaces of the web."-*Dale Smith*, poet, teacher, essayist

*"Big Bridge* is one of our most significant web sites for contemporary art
and writing-I am honored to be included."-*Anne Tardos*

"Where have the Muses survived the storms of American History? The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts? Greater New York City? The magnificent San
Francisco Bay area? Or does the 3%-translated-books statistic prove us
terminally parochial? --Terri Carrion's and Michael Rothenberg's* Big Bridg=
e
* is a golden gate to everywhere-*-*lovingly, lavishly presenting the
world's writing, art, music. The best of what's happening now, historic
documents:  it's all here in a lively journal manifesting the editorial
policy *make it fresh, make it new*."-*Lou Rowan*, editor of *Golden
Handcuffs Review *and author of *Sweet Potatoes*

"*Big Bridge* is exactly that, a gorgeous span across geographies and
aesthetics, a road to a new world. I am grateful for the vision and all the
construction work that builds this stunning bridge." - *Sarah Browning*,
Director, Split This Rock

*Big Bridge *is one of the best venues for poetry and literature currently
online. Thanks, Michael, for the work you are doing."- *Bill
Lavender*,poet, editor, and teacher. His most recent book is his
acclaimed verse
memoir, *Memory Wing*.

"I've been pouring blood, money & guts into the online Museum of American
Poetics for almost fifteen years, so I've been around the block a time or
two. *Big Bridge* is the Akashic Records of American Poetry."- *Jim Cohn*,
poet, editor, essayist, publisher and founder of the on-line Museum of
American Poetics (MAP) at

*"Big Bridge* by Michael Rothenberg has always been there. It is from his
webzine that thousands of other webzines have started, thus giving way to a
new social awareness. Michael has been the Number One in the spreading of
culture since the advent of the Internet. A poet and writer, he has
highlighted and kept alive as an editor first and foremost Contemporary
American Literature to which he has joined World Literature, in a one to
one relationship with all the authors he has featured on *Big Bridge*. It
is right through his webzine that I first met Michael, many years ago, an
excellent friend who has been intensively active. Praise will never be
enough to match his untiring enthusiasm, sensitivity, and strenuous work.
As the Editor of the Poets' Corner, it is at times easy to be tempted to
let everything go, Michael has shined as an example for me, and I am sure,
for many other editors, writers, contributors to the Belles Lettres in the
whole world."-*Anny Ballardini*, Editor of the Poets
Corner<http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=3D001dq72bl4l8yZ3IBn4ditb8tXZ7r8c710jIE7=

"Cuba, Morocco, Ohio, Neo-Surrealism, the 70's scene in Bolinas, the Philip
Whalen Journals, Wisconsin Protest Journals, translations from Japan, Iran,
Tbilisi & elsewhere. If you think, as I do, that the work of peace begins
with cultural exchange and deep awareness of other cultures, you can begin
to sense the magnitude of the work being done by the relentless Michael
Rothenberg and *Big Bridge*. The editor of the fantastic *The Collected
Poems of Philip Whalen* and *As Ever: Selected Poems of Joanne Kyger,* the
co-founder of 100 Thousand Poets for Change (the worldwide poetry event
entering its third year) has been at it in cyberspace with the e-journal
Big Bridge for 16 years. Sure, it takes huge effort to keep anything going
for 16 years (which seems like an eternity in our era of great velocity)
but to do it with such breadth, depth and quality issue after issue is
simply astounding. The connections created by this magazine are essential
to the global community and dialog that the world's best poets are
beginning to engage in and we are so much better off with Michael
Rothenberg and *Big Bridge*. Bridge building is the work we need right now
in our world and few do it with the same verve and commitment. Ash=E9!"- *P=

Call for Proposals for a special session for MLA 2014:
BEAT ARTISTS, LITERATURE, AND LANGUAGE WRITING

Deadline for Submissions: March 20, 2013
Contact information: Ronna C. Johnson (ronna.johnson@tufts.edu) and
Deborah Geis (dgeis@depauw.edu).

Seeking proposals for essays of productive discussions of the multiple
relations and interrelations, overlaps and departures, influences and
legacies effected between these disparate literary movements of the
postwar, postmodern rise. Consider questions of Beat writers, Language
poets, and the virtues and limitations of assimilation into the academy;
or questions of cooptation each movement faces in the 21st-century
academy. Discussions may take inspiration from a past body of scholarly
work on the Language movement that has sought to claim an authenticity
for poets who are skeptical about such claims, and that has sought to
place the rejection of closure that is so important to Language poetry
within the broader map of postwar poetries (including the Beats) that
increasingly embraced a poetics of indeterminacy and the politics of
poetic form. How do Beat literature and writers fit the experimental
demands of Language writing and writers?

Topics might investigate:

– Shared precursors between the Beat and Language movements (Stein,
Zukofsky, Pound, et al.)

– The influence of individual Beat poems ("Wichita Vortex Sutra," among
others) or techniques (the cutup, among others) on the Language movement

– Beat literature and individual writers of the Language movement (Ron
Silliman, Leslie Scalapino, Barrett Watten, Michael Davidson, among others)

– Self and language: Beat writing and the dispersed subjectivity of
Language poetry

– Language poetry's experiments with autobiography (texts such as
Hejinian's "My Life," Howe's "My Emily Dickinson," and the collective
autobiography "The Grand Piano," among others)

– Major presses and journals of the Language movement

– Spiritual poetics and the materiality of language

– The line in Beat poetry and Language poetry

– Experiments with syntax in Beat poetry and Language poetry

– Beats, Language poets, and the politics of poetic form

– Beat writing and Post-Language poetries

Proposals with brief professional biographies should be sent no later
than March 20, 2013, to Ronna C. Johnson (ronna.johnson@tufts.edu) and
Deborah Geis (dgeis@depauw.edu).

Dear Friends,

Brad Vogler, a founding member of Delete Press, has recently launched the
inaugural issue of Opon, a poetry journal. Please visit Opon.org to have
your eyes recede into your brain which is also your heart.

As Brad describes it: *Opon is an offshoot of Delete Press, and is edited
and maintained by Brad Vogler. Some things of interest include: poems
accompanied by writing on process/procedure, a series of revisions,
collaborative work, interviews and visual poetry. Maybe it isn=92t any of
these things, and you have something else in mind? A surprise can be nice.
Things longer in length, 8-10 pages are preferred, but this isn=92t a
requirement.

*The first issue presents work by Kate Eichhorn, Eric Goddard-Scovel,
Tirzah Goldenberg, Jill Magi, Moria L. Purdy, and Nico Vassilakis.

Enjoy!

Crane Giamo

Happy Springtime, panicked and precious friends! There's a bit of fine
new content at UnlikelyStories.org, namely:

Volume 2 of /Love Has Been Liquidated/ by John Bryan, the continuation
of his sprawling choose-your-own-adventure role-playing one-sided
epistolary-romance prose poem
and information about /Gods of a Ransacked Century/, the new 52-page
book by Marc Vincenz, which will be released this weekend at the annual
conference of the Association of Writers' Programs in Boston!

And oh, yeah, we're all over Boston. /Unlikely/ will be represented at
MadHat's bookfair booth, Booth 3010 on the second floor of the bookfair,
and I'll be there most of the weekend.

On Thursday, March 7, at 5:30pm, I'll be MCing the joint read of MadHat
and Pen & Anvil Press, and I'll be reading from /Gods of a Ransacked
Century/ on Marc's behalf, as well as from /Unlikely/ peep j/j hastain's
latest chapbook, /dear secondary umbilical//,/ (MadHat Press, 2013).
That'll be at 5:30pm, Thursday, March 7th, 2013, the Atrium of the
Sherrill Library, Lesley University, 89 Brattle St., Cambridge, near the
Harvard Square T Station.

I'll be reading Marc's poetry again on that same night at the launch
party for the #20 issue of /Cha: An Asian Literary Journal/, which
features Marc's poetry as well as work by Xi Chuan, Eleanor Goodman,
Lucas Klein, W.F. Lantry, Kim Liao, Mai Mang, Tracy Slater, Marc
Vincenz, and Nicholas YB Wong (Kaitlin Solimine will MC). That's at the
Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, the Center for Government and
International Studies--South Building, Harvard University, 1730
Cambridge St., also in Cambridge near the Harvard Square T Station if
you can't figure that out.

On Saturday, March 9, at 4pm I'll be reading poetry by the late
/Unlikely/ peep Hugh Fox, from his book /Primate Fox /(MadHat Press,
2012). I'll be joined by Bernadete Costa-Fox, Lo Galluccio, Leonora
Smith, John Roche, Doug Holder, Steve Glines, and John Gosslee. That'll
be at the Bloc 11 Cafe, 11 Bow St., Somerville.

And on Sunday, March 10, at 6:30pm, /Unlikely/ will have one final New
York read in conjunction with MadHat at the Gallery at le poisson rouge,
158 Bleeker St in Manhattan! Featuring Alexander Cigale, Steven
Dalachinsky, Dana Golin, Susan Lewis, Yuko Otomo, Jonathan Penton,
Larissa Shmailo, and the electronic musical accompaniment of Leon Dewan
of Dewanatron! Come see! We did a similar show on Saturday, March 2 at
Sidewalk Bar, and it was big fun -- come check out the refinement in a
bigger venue!

Dancing from the other end,

PoemTalkers Jessica Lowenthal, Lee Ann Brown, and Sueyeun Juliette Lee =
gathered with Al Filreis to talk about five poems from Laynie Browne=92s =
Daily Sonnets, which was published by Counterpath Press of Denver in =
2007. We chose two of Browne=92s =93fractional sonnets,=94 two of the =
sonnets in which the talk of her children is picked up partly or wholly =
as lines of the poem, and one of her =93personal amulet=94 sonnets. =
These are, to be specific: =93Six-Fourteenths Donne Sonnet=94 [MP3], =
=93Two-Fourteenths Sonnet=94 [MP3], =93In Chinese astrology you are a =
snake=94 [MP3], =93I=92m a bunny in a bunny suit=94 [MP3], and =
=93Protector #2: Your Personal Amulet=94 [MP3]. The sonnet after Donne =
is a constrained rewriting of a =93holy=94 sonnet: =93I am a little =
world made cunningly.=94

Subject:      View the Premiere Screening of Robert McTavish's "The Line Has
              Shattered" on March 21 at SFU Woodward's, Vancouver

The Line Has Shattered, a documentary film by Robert McTavish on the 1963
Vancouver Poetry Conference, is being premiered on Thursday, March 21st at
7:30pm at the Djavad Mowafaghian World Art Centre, Goldcorp Centre for the
Arts, SFU Woodward's, 149 W. Hastings Street, Vancouver. Admission is by
donation: $3.00 for students, and $5.00 for others.

http://vimeo.com/60036134

The event is being introduced by Canadian Poet Laureate (and '63
conference participant) Fred Wah.

Narrated by poet Phyllis Webb, who chronicled the event at the time, The
Line Has Shattered is a sixty-minute documentary film that revisits the
'63 Conference and hears from a number of its participants half a century
later.

The Vancouver Poetry Conference, hosted by the University of British
Columbia in the summer of 1963, is seen by many as a landmark event in the
history and development of West Coast Canadian and North American
innovative poetry - and indeed a major early manifestation of the Sixties
West Coast zeitgeist.

Organized by UBC English professor Warren Tallman and American poet Robert
Creeley, the conference was an intense, freewheeling three-week program of
discussions, workshops, lectures, and readings at which a rising
generation of Canadian and American poets, including George Bowering,
Daphne Marlatt, Fred Wah, Jamie Reid, Michael Palmer, and Clark Coolidge,
was exposed to and, in many cases, profoundly influenced by the
personalities and 'New American' open-form poetics of the visiting
poet-instructors Allen Ginsberg, Charles Olson, Denise Levertov, Creeley,
Robert Duncan, and Margaret Avison.  For many of the student participants
the conference played a key role in providing them faith that the pursuit
and practice of poetry could constitute a meaningful calling and life's work.

Robert McTavish is a Canadian documentary film-maker whose works include
Ghosts on the Land (2001), Fiddler's Map (2003) and What To Make of It
All?: The Life and Poetry of John Newlove (2006).  He also edited A Long
Continual Argument: The Selected Poems of John Newlove (Chaudiere Books,
2007, afterword by Jeff Derksen) which was hailed by the Globe and Mail as
"a fitting monument to the poet's consummate craftsmanship, and a cause
for national celebration."

This event is being co-sponsored by SFU Library and English Department,
with thanks to the Vancity Office of Community Engagement.

I'm reading with Andrew Kaufman and Barry Webster on Thursday, March 14,
for the FINAL installment of the Robson Reading Series at the University of
British Columbia in Vancouver.

This long-running series will unfortunately end as of this reading,
following the closure of UBC Library=92s Robson Square branch, and the comi=
ng
closure of the UBC Bookstore at Robson Square. I feel fortunate to have the
opportunity to read for the Robson before it is no more.

If you're in Vancouver on Thursday, March 14, please join us - it's going
to be a great reading and farewell to this venerable series.

Description:
=20
A Needle Through Night is an experiment in the spontaneous amassing of subj=
ectivities in a non-stop tornado of impressions, deliberations and observat=
ions. Like a needle pulling thread, the act of writing extracts and attract=
s whatever comes within reach, as it seeks exalted states of =E2=80=9Cinner=
=E2=80=9D revelations through sudden encounters with the outside world, and=
 which might prompt the question: Where or what is the boundary between the=
 supposed interior and exterior?

Great article linked below encouraging more response.  I'd also add that
just dropping a line to your "favorite" publication (Harpers is mine!) to
let them know you're not buying, or worse, might mean actually something

Announcing Translation, the bass accompaniment: Selected Poems by Deborah M=
eadows from Shearsman Books.

The bass guitar creates patterns that make music into a visceral experience=
=97they are what infect the body. The poems in Translation, the bass accomp=
animent: Selected Poems are in dialog with other authors, and here, experim=
ental poetry engages logician Quine, encyclopedic novelist Melville, philos=
ophers Irigaray and Deleuze, theologian and synthetic philosopher Aquinas, =
poets Dragomoshchenko, Hejinian, Baudelaire, and Celan, Soviet cinematograp=
her Vertov, video artist Bill Viola, and others. =20

Many have written of the mediated experience that language, private life, a=
nd civic life involve. In that spirit, the poetry engages the syntax of exp=
loratory thought from ten earlier books brought together here for the first=
 time and ends with a poem that hints at a version of tomorrow.=20

Available here:
http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2013/meadowsSP.html
Praise for Translation, the bass accompaniment: Selected Poems:
=93Deborah Meadows=92 deployment of translation as poetic construction offe=
rs the reader access to an unusually complex and rewarding set of investiga=
tions and interventions into philosophical and literary authority. With rem=
arkable variation, her philosophically informed poetics of indeterminacy il=
luminates patterns and structures of thinking within the cutting edge liter=
ary, artistic, and philosophical traditions that interest her: from Rabelai=
s to Melville, Vertov to Dragomoshchenko, Deleuze to Quine to name a few. T=
he poem as translation however remains equally awake to the pulses, pattern=
s, and notes of everyday life, bodily experience, popular media, the brutal=
ity of political violence and social inequities=97historically immediate to=
 the composition of the poetry. The experience of reading Meadows' writings=
 as pattern held within variation and variation informed by pattern brings =
this reader to a felt sense of historical encounter: in which =93now=94 and=
 =93then=94 and =93presence=94 and =93absence=94 necessarily appear togethe=
r.=94
--Carla Harryman


=93Deborah Meadows casts a cool and canny eye at "our notorious zoo of crue=
lty and vice," translating the toothsome and bewildering patois of the crea=
tures who live in it. "[W]hiskers of an ant," she writes, "one pound of fea=
thers, weigh it yourself!" Is it possible to parse pharmaceutical time, for=
 instance, "a sustained release," when "Mexico begins maybe three hours fro=
m here"? But Meadows, through a rich and brilliant series of ten collection=
s, gathered in these pages, never seems tempted to think of our chatter as =
the mere voiceover to a documentary on human failure, or as she brutally di=
spenses with it, "raid / another raid // sex and grooming / more grooming."=
 "Anger must save that boy," she says early on, and later, "I amongst it, I=
 kills it, I have rights." What she tumbles us to here is the critical righ=
t to inscribe our world. We pull (and are pulled by) the recalcitrant and s=
potted beeste of language until, finally, "out it comes / at leash-end." Th=
is fierce and intelligent leopard is the real thing.=94

Please join us for the upcoming Symposium on Territory with Kass Fleisher, =
Sueyeun Juliette Lee, Craig Santos Perez, and Juliana Spahr, Co-Curated by =
Bhanu Kapil and Michelle Naka Pierce.



Monday, March 18: Panel @ 7:30 pm in PAC



Tuesday, March 19: Reading @ 7:30 pm in PAC



Both events are free and open to the public.



How do we write an ethics or document of place? How do we engage both the v=
oluntary and involuntary aspects of a history of migration? How can we open=
 to the deep play of the interzone? Define: interzone. A flourishing. A bro=
ken vase. Our invited writers engage specific borders: their mutability, hi=
story, and current politics/resource needs/disputes. Can we write "territor=
y" in a way that doesn't replicate a colonizing paradigm of accountability =
or address?

seventeen seconds: a journal of poetry and poetics comes out as the
natural extension of the eight issues of Poetics.ca edited by rob mclennan
and Stephen Brockwell. Highlighting the diversity of voice, style,
practice and politic, seventeen seconds continues the resolve to provide a
forum for dialogue on contemporary poetics, with a focus on Canadian
writing. Over the past two decades, the amount of critical writing
published in print literary journals on Canadian poetry, specifically,
seems to have decreased dramatically, but slowly returned through a number
of online journals. seventeen seconds simply wishes to help strengthen the
dialogue and the ongoing conversation about writing through publishing new
writing, and conversation about new writing. How else are we supposed to
learn anything, unless we keep talking?

do we hang out the window? we murmur: stop
not under the tree. theres glass hanging there. dont walk
beneath the tree. a champagne glass spins
on a ribbon. it sing. its going to fall. sir
stop. itll fall. go back. a glass in the tree.
it will fall. the ribbon is fraying. maam
do we turn to barmaid watchman officer?
we sketch: the storm the tree the glass on the ribbon
the grime-bleached ribbon the tatters the glass the glass
we holler: youve got to do something! now! the tatters
the swaying the crunching black and blacker the sky
now! it has to be now! the singing the falling - do something!

do we storm onto the square? do we wave our arms wildly?
we scream away! away from the tree! we point upwards
glass! we chase the businessman zigzag zigzag away
a cyclist a stray kid a map-reading couple away!
beer-drinker caller tourist away! we bump we shove
we drag the guffawing teen zigzagzigzag away

shall we keep doing what were doing? formulating arguments
shall we look for support in lines within our sight we find
the branch the tight ribbon we ignore the head-hung glass
we have our mind-bruising conversation we follow the line
obliquely up along the branch down along the ribbon (to the stem
of the glass) and still: up the branchline down the ribbonline
and back again: branchline ribbonline ribbonline branchline and on

Helene Gelens is a writer of poetry, essays and prose. Her debut niet
beginnen bij het hoofd (2006) was shortlisted for the C. Buddingh Prize
for New Dutch Poetry and her second collection of poetry zet af en zweef
(2010) was awarded the prestigious Jan Campert Prize. A third collection
will be published spring 2013. Gelnss poetry has been translated in
English, German, Spanish, Polish and Albanian. English translations
appeared in literary Magazines in the UK (Ambit (2009), Poetry London
(2011), The North (2010)), and the USA (Interim (2009), Pleiades (2012),
Sampsonia Way (2012)). Gelens lives in Amsterdam and Antwerp.

Long considered one of the most outstanding poets of his generation, Erik
Lindner advocates spreading poetry using all available means and media,
and does so not only in his own homeland, but abroad as well. He regularly
publishes his poems in renowned international literary magazines such as
Poetry Review (England), Manuskripte (Austria), Interim (USA), Action
potique (France), and Luvina (Mexico), which has even led to translations
of his work into Chinese and Macedonian. Aside from his own volumes of
poetry  Tramontane (1996), Tong en trede (Tongue and Step, 2000), Tafel
(Table, 2004), and Terrein (Terrain, 2010)  and a book on the art of
poetry published in 2009, Erik Lindner published a French anthology with
contemporary Dutch poetry, Le verre est un liquide lent (Glass is a Lazy
Liquid, 2003), presenting 33 of his poetry colleagues.

My panel talk at the glitch panel, SXSW

http://www.alansondheim.org/sxsw.mp3

The panel was "2012: Year of the GLI.TC/H"
Panelists were Jon Cates, Jon Satrom, Patrick
Lichty, myself, all thanks to Bishop Zareh,
who brilliantly organized the whole thing.
The panel lasted an hour in the Longhorn Room,
Omni Downtown, under the sub-category
"Art + Inspiration."

disclaimers: I meant Iraq when I said Iran; I didn't
mean to imply to the Involuntaries came out of the
avatar work; I'm not sure I mentioned Maud Liardon's
name, I didn't have time to thank everyone at Chicago
and WVU; I stumbled a bit about the theoretical
material which I really didn't cover; I forgot to
show the Facebook profile picture of the wounded WWI
soldier; I recorded at too high a volume; I didn't
record others; I had the recorder awkwardly set. On
the other hand, a lot of material was shown and
people were excited about it all. The Razorfish
presentation was similar but shorter and cut off in
the middle of a video. Hope you get something out of
this; most but not all of the images (video/still)
are older, but not all. Finally I didn't mean to
sound like such an idiot about erasing my Odyssey
platform at the end of the last performance with
Sandy Baldwin. Everything was improvised, I did my
best.

Dear Poetics List Members,



Does anyone remember that for an article I was working on a few years ago I
posted a call for antiwar poetry? It was accepted for publication about
three years ago, but due to backlogs and whatnot it took until now to find
its way into print. In the meantime, I wrote another article focusing on
Brian Turner=92s *Phantom Noise *(2010).



I again want to thank all the members who wrote to me and shared ideas and
poems with me. I couldn=92t have written it without everyone=92s help. Even
though I was only able to write about a limited number of poets, I learned
from the broad range of approaches the possibilities available to us in
English.



Here is the original article (published most recently):


"Resisting Imperial *Jouissance*: The Transideological Line in Recent
American Antiwar Poetry." *Canadian Review of American Studies *43, no. 1
(2013): 1-22.

http://utpjournals.metapress.com/content/lg6n57260r44nq06/



And here is the newer article within a special issue on imperial affect:



"Transversality and Imperial Affect: Situating Brian Turner's Phantom
Noise." *Parallax *18, no. 4 (2012/11/01 2012): 42-53.

2 new books:

1. Claude=E2=80=88Royet-Journoud
FOUR ELEMENTAL BODIES
translated from the French by Keith Waldrop
Poetry, 368 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 978-1-936194-13-1, original paperback $20
Publication date: April 15, 2013
=20
Claude Royet-Journoud=E2=80=99s Tetralogy assembles his central volumes =
REVERSAL, THE NOTION OF OBSTACLE, OBJECTS CONTAIN THE INFINITE, and =
NATURES INDIVISIBLE [LE RENVERSEMENT, LA NOTION D=E2=80=99OBSTACLE, LES =
OBJETS CONTIENNENT L=E2=80=99INFINI, LES NATURES INDIVISIBLES]
      Royet-Journoud is one of the most important contemporary French =
poets whose one-line manifesto: "Shall we escape analogy" signaled a =
revolutionary turn away from Surrealism and its lush imagery. His spare, =
=E2=80=9Cneutral=E2=80=9D language, stripped of devices like metaphor, =
assonance, alliteration, questions the nature of =E2=80=9Cpoetic =
language=E2=80=9D as he explores the experience of loss.
=20
Claude Royet-Journoud was born in 1941, in Lyon, and lives in Paris. He =

Mark Tardi works at the intersection of American and Polish culture. The =
present volume plays on the tension between impalpable =E2=80=9Cair=E2=80=9D=
 and solid =E2=80=9Cport=E2=80=9D, between a single focus (Sean =
Scully=E2=80=99s stripes) and shifting directions of torque (Lee =
Bontecou), between hope stretching outward and implosion of infinite =
regress. It is, to quote Jennifer Moxley=E2=80=99s definition of the =
poem, =E2=80=9Ca bridge of half-measures on the way to the possible.=E2=80=

Mark Tardi grew up in Chicago. Other publications include the chapbook =
PART FIRST=E2=80=94CHOPIN=E2=80=99S FEET and the full length collection =
EUCLID SHUDDERS. He has guest-edited an issue of the journal AUFGABE =
devoted to contemporary Polish poetry and poetics.=

The day before my reading at UBC=92s Robson Series, I was fortunate to be
able to attend a reading featuring Nicole Brossard, John Barton, and
Catherine Owen as part of the Vancouver Writers Fest.

I took some photographs at the reading, which are posted on Rogue Embryo as
a slide show. There are some especially nice moments in a collaborative
reading by Nicole Brossard and Fred Wah.

International Poetry Seminar

Moving Back and Forth between Poetry and / as Translation:
Nomadic Travels and Travails with Alice Notley and Pierre Joris

(7-8 November 2013, Universit=C3=A9 Libre de Bruxelles)

Convener: Franca Bellarsi
Co-convener: Peter Cockelbergh

Over the last forty years, the concepts of nomadism and rhizomatic =
writing have become ever more prominent in North-American verse. The =
different yet highly complementary trajectories of Alice Notley and =
Pierre Joris are two cases in point. In life, their nomadism made them =
journey in opposite directions via England=E2=80=94with Joris relocating =
from Europe to the USA after a detour through the Algerian desert, and =
Notley leaving behind the American desert of her youth for New York, and =
later on Paris. Likewise, the multi-layered textual roamings that inform =
their poetic travails also unfold along a pattern of intersecting and =
diverging routes. Yet, whether in dialogue with or counterpoint to one =
another, Notley and Joris both engage in a poetics of ongoing movement =
and challenging fluidity, in writing practices that repeatedly subvert =
the conventional borders of identity, belonging and representation. =
Whereas Joris openly vindicates this nomad poetics, its presence may =
remain more implicit in Notley=E2=80=99s output but is, however, no less =
real.

Moreover, with their writing marked by a poetic hybridity that =
challenges the safe boundaries of nation, language and aesthetics, of =
gender and genre, history and myth, Notley and Joris also interrogate =
poetry as an actual form of cultural and experiential =
=E2=80=9Cferrying-over,=E2=80=9D as an act of translation that extends =
well beyond the mere faithful rendition of a would-be original. =
Notley=E2=80=99s rhizomatic imagination may have blossomed within one =
and the same language, whereas Joris=E2=80=99s has regularly involved =
circulation between different linguistic systems. Nonetheless, both =
cultivate a poetics of in-betweenness and transgression that revels in =
permanent re-creation and transposition of myth, medium and concept =
inside the very space of English.

As practitioners of a personal, experimental poetics of disobedience =
whose nomadic remappings also expand our understanding of the very act =
of translation, Alice Notley and Pierre Joris are the two keynote =
speakers who, in both dialogue and counterpoint, will inspire the poetic =
travail of this two-day international seminar hosted by the Universit=C3=A9=
 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) and its Department of Modern Languages and =
Literatures.

Under the impetus of the Notley-Joris tandem, this two-day poetic =
laboratory will thus be a space of reflection a) upon how =E2=80=9Cnomadis=
m=E2=80=9D and its rhizomatic energies affect developments in =
contemporary poetry and poetic translation; and b) conversely, upon how =
different understandings of a =E2=80=9Cnomad poetics=E2=80=9D may renew =
our approach to poetic production and translation across the ages, from =
the ancient epic up to Modernism and so-called Postmodernism.

We welcome proposals addressing=E2=80=94but not necessarily limiting =
themselves to=E2=80=94the following issues:

Whether a =E2=80=9Cnomad poetics=E2=80=9D is explicitly or implicitly =
present in their work, who are the =E2=80=9Cnomad poets=E2=80=9D of our =
time in the English language?
To what extent, as in the case of Notley and Joris, can their poetics of =
disobedience and impurity be brought into dialogue and counterpoint? How =
does their work compare with the one of Notley and Joris?
What are the non-Anglophone influences=E2=80=95both past and =
present=E2=80=95upon the contemporary forms of nomad and rhizomatic =
writing in English?
How does the hybridity inherent in poetic nomadism and rhizomatic =
practice throw a different light on works in mixed or mixed-in languages =
and/or in mixed or mixed-in media?
As an expression of restlessness and displacement, does nomad verse also =
question our conventional understanding of place and of its poetics? How =
do the works of Notley and Joris, for instance, renew our sense of the =
urban, of the desert, and of the aesthetics associated to such spaces?
How do Notley and Joris=E2=80=99s respective remappings of myth =
illuminate the possible intersections between a nomad poetics and the =
(de)construction of personal and social myth?
How does poetic nomadism bear on both our expression and understanding =
of trans-cultural and trans-historical experience?
Even further, can poetic nomadism and its rhizomatic trajectories offer =
pathways for rendering trans-species experience?
Do nomadism and its poetics of hybridity also constitute a form of =
ecopoetics? What contributions might they make to the ongoing =
theorization of ecopoetics?
In what ways does a nomad poetics and its hybrid remappings challenge =
the conventionally accepted boundaries of gender and genre?
As an active poet, how have the concepts of nomadism and rhizomatic =
writing influenced your experimental practice? To what extent has the =
different yet complementary nomadism of Notley and Joris inspired you?
As a translator of poetry, what new possibilities might Joris=E2=80=99s =
concept of =E2=80=9Cnomadic translation=E2=80=9D open up for you? How =
might Notley=E2=80=99s re-creation and transposition of Sumerian myth =
into contemporary English enrich your practical understanding of your =
own craft?
How does Notley=E2=80=99s and Joris=E2=80=99s respective interest in =
=E2=80=9Cimpure translations=E2=80=9D invite us to revise assessments of =
past translations of poetic works into English/from English into other =
languages?
What can a nomad poetics and its hybridity contribute to our =
understanding and theorization of =E2=80=9Cmetaphor=E2=80=9D and =
=E2=80=9Cimagery=E2=80=9D?
How do nomadism and its enlarged experiential field tie in with a =
poetics of the ugly, the commonplace, and the daily ordinary and =
trivial?
With its poetics of impurity and disobedience, how does nomad writing =
both challenge and renew expressions of the sacred and spiritual in =
poetry?
If we subscribe to the belief that poetry is not just an expressive =
practice, but also an epistemological one and a form of knowing, how =
does poetic nomadism help us reconsider our epistemological models?
What light does a nomad poetics throw on the phenomenon of linguistic =
and cultural exile (whether the latter be chosen or enforced)?
The working language of the seminar will be English, and the various =
Anglophone poetic traditions will be taken as a starting point, but we =
highly encourage comparative work, bringing poetic practices in other =
languages into the debate and reflection.

Dear,
Sweating out the hubris from the struggling repertoire (hands facing
upward always full too full for love to settle into, always against the
grade. Is it that empty hands tremble most           like an empty mouth
with no words to feedthe darkness that is deepest there). We are all out
of error, the passaggio stuck, in error mimicry ends, in error the opening
theme is more precise, more, so to speak. And my heart in error most,
giving out and out on Broadway, legato resonating, backed by the metal
tresses of that building, of that A, the backless Y. And the w

                         the w

                               w

                                              w

framing the inaudible exit. Do we need a glossarist so we can abandon
complexity (just for a moment? Does one need to name these Books of Gale?
Contra Gale? Muttering in cadentia, visually muttering the opening Act or
the point where the heroine falls, fully clothed, from the mist and we
realize that yes we are all players and she most of all is
tired.

Love,

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Featured in this issue of Johns Hopkins University MFA On-Line Maga
Doctor TJ Eckleberg Review.  Gives a pretty good picture of what was
happening in the Baltimore-Washington area in those times, this side of
Some of Us Press--which, maybe was finished by 1980. Michael Martone of
the Fiction Collective organized the reading.  I don't have much time
for nostalgia but this might be worth a look.

Interesting use of the word nanopress.  I guess when I think of
nanopress jwcurry's and geof huth's presses come to mind.  regardless,
good to see someone thinking about processes of distribution in the
age of post-information.

New and On View: Mudlark Flash No. 73 (2013)

The New God is a Revolver in the Sun
and So Death Blows His Little Fucking Trumpet

by John Valentine

Author's Note: It's been some 16 years now since the passing of Larry
Levis, and he is missed. He wasn't just an extraordinary wordsmith. He
was--as are we all--an uncanny event, "an unfinishable agenda of the
stars." What I've admired about his poems is his amazing ability to
point at the uniqueness, the singularity, of the existential moment and
the people in it. A very precise example of this is the poem
"Photograph: Migrant Worker, Parlier, California, 1967" in the
collection ELEGY. Here, we are invited to dwell upon the utter facticity
of Johnny Dominguez, his individual, transient, and profoundly
irreplaceable being-there. In so doing, Levis reminds us all of our own
such being. "The New God is a Revolver in the Sun" and "So Death Blows
His Little Fucking Trumpet" are thus a kind of pointing as well, an
homage, a reminder of a man and his very special talent. JV

When Mudlark Flash No. 73 first appeared in January of this year, 2013,
it was a single, "The New God is a Revolver in the Sun," just the one
poem. But since then Valentine has made what he calls "another attempt
at a Levis tribute" and that poem, "So Death Blows His Little Fucking
Trumpet" has been added to Mudlark Poster No. 73 here, a flip side, thus
making it new again.

John Valentine teaches philosophy at the Savannah College of Art and
Design in Savannah, Georgia. His poems have appeared in various
journals, including The Sewanee Review, The Midwest Quarterly, Southern
Poetry Review, The Adirondack Review, and Rock Salt Plum Review. He has
had five chapbooks published with Pudding House Publications, and one
chapbook with Big Table Publishing.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

New collection of poetry by Sydney poet, Pam Brown :

Home by Dark
by Pam Brown

published by Shearsman Books
(isbn 978 1 84861 288 4 paperback 132 pps)
(Cover Painting by Melbourne artist Jon Cattapan)
_________________________________________________________
Rachel Blau DuPlessis says :
Pam Brown's work is fearless, acutely observant, witty and wry. She
delights in the curiosities of the everyday, in notational
sprezzatura, in the penetrating encapsulation of layers of time,
chance and meaning with her twists of lexicon, diction and line break.
This is a work of quotidian consternation, breaking through from irony
to sheer fondness and painful shadows. She sees askew - and 'Home by
Dark' has its own poignant look at decades, bodies, and changes. Pam
Brown is a wonderful writer, one of the scintillating wizards of Oz
poetry.

Kate Lilley says:
Pam Brown=92s 'Home by Dark' is plainly beautiful: a subtle, moody
daybook, warding off darkness and =91counter-revolutionary=92 boredom.
Brown=92s engaged intelligence and light touch draws us into the flows
and eddies of =91a poetry world=92 where =91everything is providential,/or
not'. Reserved and intimate, swift and immersive, these poems are
=91right here=92, in the midst of precarity: 'strike another match, go
start anew'

AngelHousePress presents NationalPoetryMonth.ca, a celebration of poetic
form of all kinds and an homage to those poets who try to extend the
definition of poetry. This year's edition, which marks our fifth
anniversary, is a tribute to the Last Vispo, an anthology of visual
poetry edited by Nico Vassilakis and Crag Hill and published by
Fantagraphics in 2012. The site contains visual poetry, asemic writing,
collage, concrete poetry and other forms of whimsy by artists from
Australia, Canada, the USA, Finland, Hungary, Italy, and Sweden. Each
day in April a different visual poem will be shown. AngelHousePress
thanks all who participated and sent work for consideration and wishes
the month had at least forty five days in order to showcase all the
great poetry we received.

Starting April 1, please visit NationalPoetryMonth.ca for a different visual poem every day.

Please join the GC Poetics Group for a reading and conversation with poet
and artist Maggie O=E2=80=99Sullivan, making a rare visit to New York from =
England.
This event will center around the idea of =E2=80=9Cecho-poetics,=E2=80=9D a=
 term Charles
Bernstein uses in his =E2=80=9CIntroduction=E2=80=9D to O=E2=80=99Sullivan=
=E2=80=99s *Body of Work*.  What
constitutes an =E2=80=9Cecho-poetics=E2=80=9D? How does this diverge or com=
plement
ecopoetics? What does it mean to =E2=80=9Chalf-sing a song=E2=80=9D and how=
 does this
connect to modern renderings of lyric?

* **** *

*Maggie O=E2=80=99Sullivan* is a British-based poet, performer, and visual =
artist,
whose books include *In the House of the Shaman* (1993), *Body of Work*(200=
6),
*WATERFALLS* (2009) and *murmur*, newly published by Veer Books.  Her work
has also appeared extensively in journals and anthologies and she has
performed internationally, often in collaboration.  She is the editor of *O=
ut
of Everywhere:  An Anthology of Contemporary Linguistically Innovative
Poetry by Women in North America and the UK*, and collaborated with Bruce
Andrews on *eXcLa* (1993).  She has a close association with Veer Books and
the Birkbeck Contemporary Poetics Research Centre.  *All Origins are
Lonely*(2003) was the inaugural Veer publication, and her
*ALTO =E2=80=93 London Poems, 1975 =E2=80=93 1984 *was published by Veer in=
 2009. Online
recordings of her work may be heard at PennSound. Her website is
www.maggieosullivan.co.uk.
