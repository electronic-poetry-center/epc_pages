haven't been following this, really, but I know it's about novels that are
'poetic' in various ways. Joyce certainly has been mentioned, and hopefully
Proust. Here are some others that come to mind.

Cosmos, by Witold Gombrowicz (also Ferdydurke, Pornographia)
How German Is It, by Walter Abish
The Island, by Robert Creeley
The Gold Diggers and Other Stories, by Robert Creeley
Hopscotch, by Julio Cortazar
Tristram Shandy, by Lawrence Sterne
various novels (if one can call them that) by Gertrude Stein
Yellow Back Radio Broke Down, by Ishmael Reed (other books by Reed as well)
various novels by Fanny Howe
various novels by Harry Matthews
various novels by Christine Brooke-Rose
Toulouse-Latrec, by Kathy Acker
The Park, by Philippe Sollers
Defoe, by Leslie Scalapino


there are really so many, although small compared to all novels available,
certainly
but then, poetry I like to read is a small fraction of all poetry available

At the risk of sounding opinionated, I'll say that the more oblique parts of
language, punctuation, etc., are there to be USED.  I think it's a scandal
that a lot of people do not know how to use the semicolon (as someone said
was true of their students, & which is manifestly true in a lot of writing).
  Orwell's essay should be required reading for everyone, not because he's
right about everything but because he makes you THINK about what language is
doing.  Stein's "Poetry and Grammar" does that, in a very different way.
However, if we all followed GO's advice literally we'd be writing
Hemingwayisms.  The most boring literature possible.

I was there and the discussion had little, if anything, to do with the
manifesto.  Richard spoke about the business of putting together anthologies
(securing rights, etc.), and Jerry mostly read from his poetry and that of
some others represented in his anthologies.  Bill

I dont risk "sounding" opinionated; I am opinionated. For God's sake; the
semi-colon; either taken alone or in those beautuful long prose-poetic
passages from Edward Thomas; or Ashbery; or Proust; or even the Charles
Dickens of "Bleak House" (from which Eliot stole his theme of "The yellow
fog that rubbed across the window pane" etc) would be totally bereft;bereft
and dead; dead and bereft in sans absentiae semi colonsia; whose birth iinto
literature was as mysterious (and today for most souls) as mystifying, as
The Word itself;which word it is held; "walked the world" shedding
light;which recalls me to the Bible; which latter book - usually black -
would be terribly bereft and derived in the absence of the semi colon; that
straunge device whose lower half - rather like the human "trunk"; curls or
droops downwards as if struggling by;or against; Gravitas to escape the more
severe singleness of that - presumably circular "splot!" (forgive me dearly
and recently departed Victor Borges); as if indeeed to accentuate poetry or
literature - nay Art Itself's - deep Being;singleness struggling in a
Jakobian or Nietscian Life Struggle in the Heart, and the very Light, of
language: order versus chaos;plainess in diversity; sanity versus madness;
the inescapable and semiotically hermetic "splot!" arguing that all things
perish; the almost spermatic "squook" arguing; as argue it must; in favour
of escape; and escape to life through death;death though life;the "squook"
wriggling to escape the torment of the dominant and patriarchal text; while
the valiant "splot!' struggles on in Borgesian ambiguity; whether you take
the Victor or the Jorges;and infinities of perplexities expand from the
semi-colon; known to some as the half-colon;hated and loved;loved and
reviled;endlessly and tragically reborn. R; T;

Former list lurker Tom L Taylor-- who felt of the two list-oirented readings

THE  RESURRECTION OF  POETRY
  For Vincent Ferrini, a friend for life

Skulking mimics prowl
the halls of ivy
forging a dysfunction
-ate presence.
They dip their hands
in vats of light &
pull forth a black,
viscous absence
dripping blood and time.
Their spaceless havens
detail a hopeless
journey into Mind
& leave us gasping
and empty within
their vapid, songless
moans.  Within Heart,
a callow monolog declines
passion & contact,
isolating Self with
out pity or scorn.
An insensate gloom
fills our stripmined
atmosphere where
the Poet hangs
from the tree of his
career, & children
lope & canter in the
ceaseless misery of
knowing & certitude.
"Help Wanted" reads
the sign of the times
where no-one applies
for the Truth of
Light.  Infoslaves
prowl the airwaves
in search of something

to steal, & chatter
an aimless, despondent
wail of envy and stain
the walls with their
excreta, & the fallow
stream chokes on
pollution from a
leaden sky.  Without
hope, they caw and
stumble round the
ivory tower, with
its blackened beacon
hurling the invective
of the ages at our
bound feet as the angel
of song shrieks a
hollow song.  This
is the ceaseless
present.  This is the
hour of which we have
spoken as no words enter
into the soul's empty
sores & chasms.  A
darkened sky lowers
& claims us all.

This is no dream
but the scream of
a silence which
invades us all.
this is the moan.
This is the term
and emptying of
the Dream.

the war of the future is now and the pen is mighty
sing of the keyboard as the enemy is decimated
the postmodern revolution triumphs by metaphor
wounds of theory never heal
the postmodern revolution has destroyed them all
our footnotes are our clandestine victorious army
the truth shall be destroyed by theory armament
our armament is our topic-outlines
our armament is our font-style-sheets
our writings cross distances of space and time
our writings kill
behold our writings
postmodernism arms us and truth is smashed
truth is smashed asunder
footnotes are the tanks of the postmodern revolution

Rapidly threatening to overtake Ben Stein in the avuncular teacher category,
who should appear in "Finding Forrester," Gus Van Sant's pleasantly middling
remake of his own pleasantly middling "Good Will Hunting," but Charles
Bernstein? Yes, poetry fans, it's true. But don't take my word for it -- see

Subject: [Y4M] BLA/BPP Prisoners Awareness Week - Aug. 2001

Greetings camaradas,

My name is Ernesto Aguilar and I'm involved with the Houston section and People of Color Caucus of the Anarchist Black Cross Federation, a six-year old revolutionary formation organized for the support, defense and freedom of Political Prisoners and Prisoenrs of War. The ABCF is best known for the Warchest Program and Emergency Fund for PP/POWs, as well as the the new Emergency Response Network.

I'm interested in speaking with anyone who might be interested in seeing an international awareness week for BLA/BPP PP/POWs in August sometime, organizations interested in building locally and endorsing nationally such an event, and ideas and input from others. Please drop me a line at your convenience.

Over the years, many of us have worked for the freedom, support and defense of BLA/BPP prisoners such as Sundiata Acoli, Jalil Muntaquim, Sekou Odinga, Mutulu Shakur and others. This idea is an effort to give all of us a date of major focus (Black August) around which to agitate and build even more outreach to struggle around these sisters' and brothers' campaigns.

Any and all feedback, comments, suggestions, support and efforts are appreciated!

Saludos,

Ernesto Aguilar

To Listmates:

In reviewing ( N.Y. Times, 31 December, 2000) Pierre Joris' s translation of
Celan's Threadsuns, Mark M. Anderson misses the point, while acknowledging
it. Joris does capture a language "that retains the strangeness of the
original German," along with Celan's movement of voice, his line-breaks, the
dislocated syntax, and, yes, those compound words. Joris has served Celan's
poems well: enabling us to extend our understanding of Threadsuns with a new
and seamless unity, revealing a trope for poetic selfhood, and, as it were,
recuperating into English a sense of occasion -- the very expression that
must have made these poems.

Best,
Gerald

Aldon and all, responding a bit late (too late!) after a holiday month
with a new infant (my own, not the lord and savior jesus christ...) but I
want to mention an interesting parallel to Aldon's insights, namely,
Emerson's Fugitive Slave Law addresses, where he too was dealing with
"strict constructionists" on the court who were upholding this law.
Emerson said this:

"You relied on the Supreme Court.  The law [i.e. The Constitution] was
right, excellent law for the lambs.  But what if unhappily the judges were
chosen from among the wolves, and give to all the law a wolfish
interpretation?"

A question for our times indeed!

-m.

 According to anielsen@lmu.edu: >
> Hearing these hearings gives a much clearer view of what "strict construction" and "original intetnt" really mean in these contexts.  In the first hearing, Scalia pronounced his construal the only way that a text could possibly be read.  In the second hearing he pronounced any reading other than his own to be irrational.  Meanwhile, in one of his first interventions, he spoke of the ballots in question being ballots that the machines were not supposed to count.  How does a strict constructionist dedicated to original intent ascertain this without actually looking at one of the ballots?  And is it not passing strange that he takes no notice of the fact that these machines have a published error rate -- which means quite plainly (and if you don't agree you must simply be irrational) that the machines read some votes where they "shouldn't" and fail to read some votes where they "should" --
>
> At least that's how I read it.
>
> It appears that a strict construction is an opinion with the power of the state apparatus lined up behind it -- which is why Scalia's original intent was to install the shrub in the shrubbery no matter what the voters of Florida (who, as he opined in hearing one, have no real right to vote for president anyway) may intend.

If GO had studied his own family tree, he'd have known that one of his ancestors
devised the semicolon, and that this idea of his great grandpa Increase Orwell
kept the family fed and clothed for decades and, ultimately, bestowed a generous
trust fund for Georgie. Despite groundswell support for the Big Comma, the
semicolon won out due to Great G Increase's fine arguments based in logic,
rightness and bloody-obvious-ness.
Did George want only periods and commas? Was he averse to using any references
to the human colon?  [ I have a redesign of the common keyboard which
accommodates MORE punctuation than we currently employ. Well, two extra keys,
for now.]
How did the deletion of the Semicolon come about? Did the Motion Picture
Association place it at the top of their agenda because a parents group
complained that the semicolon perplexed their kids so that they couldn't enjoy
the subsequent feature film and walked out demanding refunds? Who ratted on the
Semicolon?
Who would rat on such a perfect piece of punctuation: it provides a longer pause
than the comma without severing the information preceding it. Who could find
fault in such beauty? Are you responsible for its dismissal? Please tell me who
it was and I'll have a word with them; a word or two.

The problem is with the language.  Linguists probably have a
name for it--for where the name of a set is the same as the name
for one of the members of the set.  Another example I alone (as far
as I can tell) am bothered by is "art."  My solution there was
to invent "illumagery" as my word for visual art (after auditing
scores of other candidate over several years), and leave "art" for
"art-in-general."  My solution for the doctor/doctor problem would
be to call medical doctors "healers" and address them as Hr. Smith,
Hr. Jones, etc.  (I'm not keen on titles but see the value of
a medical doctor's vocation being a highly overt part of his
identity since it can have to do with life and death.  I don't see
any purpose in a Ph.D.'s being called "doctor" except statuznikry.
(That's my coinage for excessive concern for status.)

        well--

        this was way back in the days--

        but maybe some of you recall when

        "Ph.D" stood for "pretty heavy dude"

        --or--"piled high deep"!

        and  a pimp was called "Dr. Love"--

        or even farther back--Dick Stuart who played two years

        for Red Sox--hit 75 home runs--had hit seventy in one year

        in minors--couldn't field for love nor money

        someone threw out some newspapers to him and hot dog

        wrappers--and he managed to grab them in swirling wind--

        all about seven thousand fans of then terrible team stood and

        applauded for several minutes

        they called him "Dr, Strangeglove"

        "a title on the door--rates a Bigelow on the floor"

        the main thing is--whether respect or ridicule--one has

        accomplished what one set out to do--

        and that is --reason enough--

I want to take this poetry-as-fiction thread further and offer some examples.

It seems to me that no matter how we come to it, whether we hold that poetry
hunts for the truth of experience and the means of expressing it...or that
poetry does not translate or explain an experience; it simply presents
language -- there's plenty of examples of poetry-as-prose-as-fiction (and all
the inherent permutations).

Three examples come readily to mind:

- The Capital of Ruins, Samuel Beckett

- Sermon 48: Ein meister sprichet: alliu glichiu dinc minnent sich under
einander, Meister Eckhart

- A Christmas Carol for Emanual Carnevali, Kay Boyle

These, and I hope others will share others, demonstrate a "poetic thinking"
unlike any other kind of thinking we do. It is both more interesting and more
strange. And it is at ease with ambiguity.

They give us a place to enter with a personal connection, a reminiscent
image, the oddly familiar gesture, a universal join.

over...    Gerald

P. S. If nothing else, let my little examples serve as New Year's Reading.

Most of us (there may be a doctor in the house) are not real doctors.
Some of us are PhD's.  It is a trick of language that uses "Dr." for
both.

Anyway, don't want to belittle anyone's achievement, but why elevate
Ph.D. (or M.D. for that matter) into something worth crowing about?
When I need my appendix taken out, I will see a surgeon, when I have
a serious question about literature I try to find someone who knows
the answer, often this is someone without a Ph.D.

An exercise:  think of the most learned contemporary poets with whose
scholarly/theoretical work you are familiar.  My bet is that this a
good number of them will not have PhD's.

Me, I think people, whether educated or not, tend to know who's who,
and that degrees have little to do with anything other than
requirements for employment ("food service worker, must have high
school diploma...").  Education and training, ah, that's another
matter.

Most of the personal insults on this list I ignore but this post/review of
the events in DC disturbs me. Not only is it mean spirited but it serves
only to insult and degrade a cadre of writers with the one stop shop
efficiency inherent to intellectual vapidity. If this person -the
mediation of the forwarded e-mail obscures the source- really wants to
call people these people names I suggest that they try a bowl of moxie and
attempt a little critical insight.

The Insurance Industry/FBI Connection
By Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman

Wouldn't it be great if environmentalists could have a close working
relationship with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), so that
anytime the local industrial polluter spouted cancer-causing chemicals
into the air or water, the FBI agents would bust into the corporate
executive suites and haul away the perpetrators?

Or when insurance companies rip off policyholders, or fail to pay out on
insurance policies, wouldn't it be great if consumer groups had a working
relationship with the FBI -- just pick up the phone and call your local
FBI agents, and have them knock on the door of the CEO of the insurance
company, and begin asking questions?

Wouldn't it be great if law enforcement sided with individuals against
corporate criminals in our midst?

In the area of insurance fraud, at least, it might balance the scales of
justice. Right now, the FBI has developed a very close working
relationship with National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB). The Chicago area
crime-busting group is funded by the insurance industry to investigate
crimes against insurance companies -- for example, to crack down on
individuals who stage auto crashes to cash in on insurance policies.

Last year, the property and casualty insurance industry pumped $28 million
into the NICB. And NICB has developed a very close relationship with the
FBI. Robert Bryant, a former number two man at the FBI, is now the
president of NICB. Gene Glenn, a former special agent in charge of the
Salt Lake City Division of the FBI, is now the NICB's vice president for
field operations.

The FBI has a series of written memorandums of understanding (MOU) -- at
least three -- outlining in detail the working relationship.

According to Jim Spiller, NICB's executive vice president, one deals with
"a very highly sensitive covert operation" that he could not reveal to us,
one deals with a joint FBI/NICB crackdown on the theft and export of
automobiles, and the third addresses "the sharing of information about
stolen vehicles." (The NICB refused to let us see copies of the MOUs.)

The FBI/NICB relationship was exposed by Bill Conroy, the editor of the
San Antonio Business Journal. Over the past 18 months, Conroy has written
a series of articles that have been ignored by the mainstream media.

In his series, Conroy reported that:

* A national FBI/NICB operations called Sudden Impact involved joint
interrogation of suspects, joint search warrant raids and joint access to
medical records through an insurance industry database.

* Operation Sudden Impact netted minorities at a rate of nearly 8 to one.

* A lawyer whose San Antonio office was raided by the FBI as part of
Sudden Impact was never charged with a crime. The FBI told Conroy that it
has no records indicating that the attorney has "ever been of
investigatory interest to the FBI."  The lawyer claims that the raid
destroyed his practice and reputation.

* A former FBI informant claims that the FBI was targeting Iranians in San
Antonio as part of Operation Sudden Impact.

* An Assistant U.S. Attorney who was removed from an FBI/NICB case after
making allegations of misconduct against her fellow attorneys involved in
the case is now claiming that she is being persecuted by the U.S.
Attorney's office.

(The San Antonio Business Journal is owned by American City Business
Journals, which is owned by the Newhouse chain. American City Business
Journals owns about 40 business journals around the country.
Interestingly, after the articles appeared in print, insurance giant AIG
took out ad space on the web site of the American City Business Journals
(www.bizjournals.com). The series of articles describing the NICB/FBI
connection were never picked up by the other business journals in the
chain.)

Two members of Congress -- Charles Gonzalez, D-Texas, and Cynthia
McKinney, D-Georgia -- are looking at possible Congressional inquiries
into the NICB/FBI connection.

The NICB denies targeting minority groups. "Our criminal investigations
are conducted based on the criminality, not the culture of any
individuals," Spiller said. "It's unfortunate that the people involved in
this investigation were minorities. We follow the money."

Would the NICB investigate insurance companies who were ripping off
consumers? "No," Spiller said. "That would be a job for state insurance
regulators."

But Doug Heller of the Los Angeles-based Foundation for Taxpayer and
Consumer Rights says he wishes the FBI and NICB would pay some attention
to insurance industry rip-offs of consumers.

"The level of consumer fraud against insurance companies is minuscule
compared to the insurance company fraud perpetrated against insurance
policyholders around the country," said Heller. "But law enforcement
rarely pays attention to insurance industry crimes perpetrated against
consumers. We would love to have an agreement with the FBI to go after the
insurance industry. We have plenty of leads for them."

The FBI says that it works closely with some public interest groups, like
the American Association of Retired Persons, to crack down on
telemarketing fraud, for example.

But FBI spokesperson Angela Bell could not say whether or not detailed
written agreements -- like those hammered out between the FBI and NICB --
exist for non-industry groups.

Every year, the FBI puts out its "Crime in the United States" report,
which informs the nation about street crimes. There is no equivalent for
corporate and white collar crime.

The FBI is cooperative with industry groups who want to crack down on
street thugs. Isn't it time to show a little cooperation with public
interest groups that want to crack down on corporate and white collar
crime?


Russell Mokhiber is editor of the Washington, D.C.-based Corporate Crime
Reporter. Robert Weissman is editor of the Washington, D.C.-based
Multinational Monitor. They are co-authors of Corporate Predators: The
Hunt for MegaProfits and the Attack on Democracy (Monroe, Maine: Common
Courage Press, 1999).

it a number of times, and at one point was advisory editor. This issue has
an article of mine of interest here - "Virtualife.org - An Online Artist

There's also an excellent article by George Howell, "Lifeonthe.net -

Does anyone have information on the planned inauguration protests in D.C. on
Jan. 20th?

Specifically, I need info on buses leaving from NYC: when, where, who, how
much, return trips (?)

Also, I heard the police is refusing permits--is there any recent change in
that unconstitutional denial of the right to assemble?

Thanks in advance

Charles Borkhuis
Alpha Ruins
Price??
Bucknell University Press
ISBN: 0--8387--5442--2
108 pp.

Borkhuis' poems pick up somewhere where the fifth section of the "Waste
Land" left off, describing deserted contemporary landscapes in which the
dead and living intermingle with a chilling ease: "details drain / little
lights into people / now and at the hour of our recycling / rain grows
upwards / in trails of transparent veins / that cool and cluster into
floating cities / the earth shadowed by thoughts / thoughts shadowed by
people / people shadowed by machines" ("Close Up and Far Away," 37) .  With
an even paced tone reminiscent of Robert Duncan or Michael Palmer, though
without their formally variety,  the poems of Alpha Ruins insinuate
themselves into the breathy alleys of the city, the between moments of
thinking, and the fissures of being: "(inside a sideways glance) / passage
to the outside / as if this... / tunnel were a switch / drifting through
matter / where the big thoughts roam" ("The Gaze," 31).  The poems are most
effective when the surreal tone is anchored by recognizable imagery from
life and an occasional sense of humor, as in the dark but playful "Slice of
Life": "to open the cover of a book to find / a miniature author inside /
asleep in his coffin / dressed as a ghost / carries a rubber hatchet / [...]
the cop teaches his club a new twist / the irate customer clicks his remote
control / the doctor depresses your tongue with a stick / [...] you could
have fooled / my camera" (60)  Borkhuis seems outside any recognizable
American tradition,  but like Charles Henri  Ford could be considered a
standard bearer for a type of surreal style that is often dismissed for
being overly earnest, too "Jungian" or archetypal in its imagery,  and
generally "mystical" -- the blueprint for a permanent misfit.  Times have
changed, though, with poets like Will Alexander and, occasionally, Palmer to
recall those heady modernist times; indeed, with the rise of neo-noir
stylistics and cyber-culture, along with "schizo" proliferation of images
that digital technology has brought to the movie screen, poetry like
Borkhuis' may have finally found its moment.  At times, the poems move
somewhat near William Gibson's hallucinogenic (or "virtual") melancholy
style ("lost secrets live echoes / particle-currents in the veins / whispers
while you write // moist earth buried in the body / of answers say circular
ruins / peeling back the skin // or turning a page / landscape with friends
standing / on a hill of yellow leaves", 61); at others it actively recalls
high surreal tradition -- it is drenched in urban phantasmagoria a la
Breton's Nadja, not to mention a few direct references to "shooting into the
crowd," (21, 35) Breton's infamous anarchistic trope for the cracking of the
veils of reality -- hence never becoming too slick or too antiquated.
Though Alpha Ruins doesn't often escape its closed cycle of images and
preoccupations, indulging in words like "infinity" and "monads" a bit
recklessly, when it hones in on a resonant chain of images and a less
"dreamlike" tone -- as in "Close Up and Far Away" and Francis Bacon-like
"The Surgeon's Glove" ("blaze of hair / SPLICED / into footage of a golden
carp sliding / off the dissecting table") -- it is beautiful in a
distinctive, contemporary way.

In these two books of prose poems, Berg strains for the visceral
transcendence of the saints, a fairly anachronistic project considering =
how
the Beats -- by accessing such "cursed" moderns as Artaud and Rimbaud =
--
have apparently exhausted the subject.  He describes a sort of ars =
poetica
in Halo, a series a short quasi-religious paragraphs: "Curtains she =
calls it
'curtain of the world' mercy behind it on the other side cruelty here =
in the
God-world no-God, whenever I read to her -- 'I have to know that as a
thinking, finite being I am God crucified' -- it shreds me, no-time =
which is
God God everywhere everything we are, often in great heat I write to a
friend say everything that shames batters inspires won't send it burn =
it on
stove papery ash God's words, woke in the dark again clawed the =
unwalled
dark again." ("Simone," 19)  Something seems either entirely naive or
slightly forced about these poems, as their basic form -- the run-on
sentence that drops elements of normal syntax as it seems spoken in a =
"white
heat" -- is both not very beautiful to read, and not nearly as =
gregarious,
image-laden or charming as his New American models -- O'Hara in =
"Meditation
In An Emergency" and Ginsberg in his major early works such as the
confesional "Kaddish."  Nor do they seem to have anything contained =
within
them that society is necessarily suppressing (Berg is not being =
"suicided by
society," and he has no counter-culture to expose) nor philosophically
resonant, and so one wonders whether a craft-obsessed poet -- whether =
Basho
or Williams -- would have been able to find profundity in the
pseudo-profundity of "Of": "That death is what you cannot do that death =
is
what you cannot be that death is not the opposite of nothing." (24)  =
Porno
Diva Numero Uno is more successful, as it takes as its central theme an
imaginary relationship between the author and Marcel Duchamp around the =
time
he was constructing his final work Etant donn=E9s [1946-66] (housed in =
the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, from which city Berg edits and publishes =
the
American Poetry Review).  But once again, Berg's form stumbles, as even
interesting speech seem compromised by the poet _making excuses_ for =
the
language by applying -- even where a dialogic contrast seems necessary =
--
elements of his "signature style," the run-on: "...I could name =
anything
just by touching it but it was only after a period of disgust with =
visual
art with the quality of distance it depends on that I decided -- and =
this
was the only reason for my decision -- to do some of my things so the =
idea
was touch not art how would you like to eat an apple drink a glass of =
wine
if you didn't have hands anyhow put a bicycle wheel and a stool =
together
black white and you've got the wildness of an impossible combination
combined you almost don't know what to do with it touch look spin sit =
eat
what? so I'm like a blind artist I _am_ a blind artist a man with no =
ideas
only the memory of that early lesson'" (13)  Porno Diva -- as its =
flashy
title suggests -- seems framed as a deep, candid investigation of =
eroticism
of the cheap suburban brand, but while Battaille is clearly the =
godfather,
here, Berg doesn't make many of his own investigations -- very few =
images,
digressions, infatuations, etc. seem particularly inspired by Berg's =
sexual
imagination.  Though an interesting image may point one somewhere in =
that
direction ("...in our age two removes from the viewer first the door =
then
the wall then herholding the puny lamp of orgasm up there dream of =
faceless
leather..." [66]), for the most part it seems Berg is undecided whether =
to
be Duchamp's Boswell (though much of Duchamp's material seems taken =
from
common sources), the hectic but image-dry visionary of Halo, or a =
collagist
of art-related non-sequiturs.   Berg seems to get focused when he =
introduces
genuinely odd unliterary matter that intrigues him, such as the long =
section
on the mating habits of Rhinoceri, in which the sentences become =
suddenly
rather narrative, not to mention sickly tittilating.  Perhaps that is a
lesson, for though Berg calls himself an "apostle of the ordinary" =
(27), one
wonders why he opts for the ecstatic, fireworks mode in his writing =
when the
material is so plain.

Drifting
Dominic Cheung
Green Integer (No. 79)
$9.95
120 pp.
ISBN: 1--892295--71--7

As Cheung writes in the Forward to his first American collection, these
poems ring with notes of "a sense of the diaspora, a misplacement of time
and space, and a feeling of helplessness regarding fleeting life and love."
(i)  Living in the United States since 1967, the Taiwanese-born Cheung had
already published two volumes of poetry and one volume of prose in his early
twenties.  He proves himself, in translating his own work into English (all
from a 1986 collection called Drifters), to have a subtle and pleasant ear
for off-rhymes and the effect of simple vocabulary and syntax, no doubt
informed by the Western tradition of translations from Asian languages, but
not anxious or ironic about it.  The opening poem,  "Fragrant Herbs by the
Mountain Stream," effectively builds up the mythological tone centered
around the history of a Tibetan knife he received as a gift, a history
resonant of death and, perhaps, of cultural revenge against colonial China:
"But the Han Chinese brough in liberation and suppression, / Modernization
and pollution,  / Recovery and hatred, / Tearing out the heart of the green,
green plain. // Vaguely I hold this Tibetan knife in my palm,  / No one
knows of my martial skill." (16-17)  "Love Poem of Tea" -- a short poem that
flirts with ballad meters while never straying from the softer tones of
"Oriental" free verse -- begins a series of poems centered around the tea
ritual: "Let your dryness inside me / Softly uncoil and stretch; / Let me
dissolve / Imperceptibly, your tension," (18) he writes, the masculine
ending "stretch" and feminine "tension" creating a deft half-rhyme that
suggests, as well, the subtle workings of gender in a poem in which the male
protagonist imagines himself as a bowl of tea.  Spring and autumn seem, for
Cheung, the seasons of the melancholic wanderer,  as his most resonant
moments come in describing them: "In the fiction and reality of flower
seasons / To search for a good friend / Transcending language and age /
Remains an heroic quest, and an illusion." (41)  Cheung seems to resemble,
in this way,  the Eliot of "Journey of the Magi" more than the wintry,
"Anglo-Saxon" Pound of Cathay, and at times Cheung's taste in abstractions
also suggest Eliot,  though his subtle ear is sometimes unable to completely
salvage a pile-up of loose sentiments: "Though the same season and weather
prevail / The country never ceases changing / There are themes of passion,
and of indifference; / Though the same person and personality remain / Stars
and events keep mutating / There are plots of joy, and of sadness. / Since
departure and reunion remain unpredictable / Loneliness is conspicuous."
(44)  But Cheung is less a philosopher than a social and political exile, a
wanderer on American shores who is unsure not only of his own identity but
that of his home country, stuck in its own limbo.  His melencholy, passion,
and the complexity of his situation are finely expressed in this group of
poems: "Endless drifting, wandering among time, / As it thickens with the
midnight dew/ [...] Self, the self, to be identified! / Nation, the nation,
to be recognized! / Life,  a life to be realized! / Country, a country, to
become strong!" (59)

Dorothy Trujillo Lusk & Rod Smith

For ten years, ever since we first stumbled on her prophetic books Redactive
and Oral Tragedy, we have watched and waited until NASA thought it safe to
unleash the Vancouver poet DOROTHY TRUJILLO LUSK onto the porous, red soil
of the San Francisco Bay Area. Her intricate and dazzling powers of thought
are combined with a seductive music and erudition that bewilder and enchant,
like those two little twin fairies in the Godzilla pictures. Her other books
include Volume Delays (Sprang Texts 1994) and Sleek Vinyl Drill (Thuja Books
2000); a new collection will appear this year from Krupskaya. "Writing,
here, can initiate a not so softened horizon: exsentimental flying saucers
of evidence, severely outside." -- Bruce Andrews.

When ROD SMITH last appeared at Small Press Traffic many years ago, he was
the boy wonder of the sizzling hot Washington DC poetry scene. His gifts as
an editor had long been acknowledged but his consummate mastery of
post-modern poetic style was just coming to the surface. From young turk to
elder statesman, look at him now. Poetry is the quickest of all the arts:
you know nothing one minute and you know everything the next, and no one
knows this with more feeling, more empathetic intelligence and wide-ranging
experimentalism, than Rod Smith. "Let thy rod be my staff," says the Bible.
"For the last shall be first." Two new books, The Good House and The Given,
are forthcoming in 2001.

I think the paradox of poetry at its "highest" is that it does both: it
seeks to describe truth or experience etc but is itself or aspires itself to
be a kind of ambiguous music.( Steven's "ambiguous undulations") A thing in
itself, devising itself, speeking
itself .  Mallarme struggled for something as "pure"  as music, as maybe
did  Trakl. But a poet like Celan (and Perre Joris 's translation and
comment on Celan's famous poem  ("Todtnauberg") of his encounter in 1966
with Heidegger
brilliantly shows this (on the EPC site)) or in a very different way
Geoffrey Hill is (are) discussing or "dealing with" complex issues of
morality and history. For Celan it was personal, he lived it. Can we judge
him? Impossible. (But we all have our tragedies.) And the poems are often
intricate like puzzles that are endlessly re-enigmatized. "Messages in
bottles" someone described them.  But just as Malevich's square is seen in
many
different ways, so poetry,(or whatever you call it say Art or New Making:
nothing will probably do...) is seen from  (or in or by)  many  faces, or by
or with many
eyes. The ideal poem,as I see it,  is not static, set in stone, eternally
cherished: it
IS a process; constantly shifting in its shapes, shaping itself and its
creator, perplexing or intriguing the reader. The concept of the single
perfect poem is over. If we mimic nature at all, we know from Stein and
Joyce and Mansfield and Woolf (say of "Mrs Dalloway") and Wallace Stevens
and
(writers whether you call them poets or novelists  or artists) right back
and  foreward thru time, that permanence is an illusion. Poetry (or
Literature - I dont distiguish)   is an
endless language experiment and an endless process of process in  process.
"The poetry of the earth is never still"...  Nor can it be defined: poets
re-ask the same questions of  life love loss death birth. And simple joy,
say of Browning's:"That's the wise thrush/ He sings each song thrice
over/lest you should think /He never could recapture/ That first fine
careless rapture." (From memory). And the Language Poets
havent diminished this project. They've brought a more intense inspection of
the nature of the process. The interaction of the social  the historical and
the political is made clear and so on....
   Berrigan says in one of his sonnets: "I too have read the technical
journals".  Which must be clear, transparent: they must communicate. But
poetry communicates in more devious and damnable ways.  It is because we
have been slaughtered into life and cursed or blessed with language speech
and consciousness. But lets not get too gloomy, I can hear the baby of the
young woman next door."The doors of the Academy of the Future are opening."
(To quote Berrigan quoting Ashbery who was quoting Pasternak). Life
continues, poets or no poets: philosophers philosophy or not. That's enough,
a child chatting. Time for me to have a coffee and a cake or whatever.
Richard. PS I'm also a great fan of Beckett's later prose pieces. By the
way, how many share my almost paranoid obsession with not making UN
deliberate grammatical or spelling errors? Probably excessive
"perfectionism". Silly, in a way.  O.k as long as I dont find my emails take
ten thousand revisions! Regards all.

from BODY TAPESTRIES by STUART LISHAN

Stuart Lishan has published work in a number of literary journals and
e-zines, including, most recently and upcoming, XCONNECT, BARROW STREEET,
ARTS & LETTERS, KENYON REVIEW, LA PETITE ZINE, IN POSSE REVIEW, FOR
POETRY.COM, THE JOURNAL, POET LORE, AMERICAN LITERARY REVIEW, and SMARTISH
PACE. The poems in this issue are from a full-length manuscript entitled,
surprise, BODY TAPESTRIES, which was a finalist in last year's (2000) Walt
Whitman award competition.

__________


THE BREEZE FLUTTERED TAPESTRY: APRIL

"Inward"; "Cold!"; such is the pared speech of blossoms,
Which is their bent attitude of blame
As April rain congeals to snow; like lost suns
The daffodils curl on themselves, and I, in the same
Bowed speech, remember that far off summer
When you were gone, that night at Sweet Springs,
When you were gone, by the tide-swelled marshes, where star-
Light cantilevered through the water rings
Past the frog songs, past the caterpillar
Spinning her silks into the fog filtered moonlight --
These breeze fluttered tapestries of my years --
So they seemed that eucalyptus scented night
As the dew fell, and the caterpillar's silks glistened;
"Come," they shone, "Begin here; closer; listen..."

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

In 1955, after an evening of piano works by Cage and Stockhausen generated
much anger and scoffing at Wesleyan, RK Winslow, a professor of music at the
school, wrote a letter to the campus paper, the Argus, suggesting, as
follows:

"Those who were antagonized by the performance and who have run out of
descriptive terms for it, can find a variety of fresh insults in a book
called Lexicon of Musical Invective by Nicolas Slonimsky (Olin Library), a
compilation of on-the-scene reactions to the music of, e.g., Beethoven,
Bach, Mozart, Verdi, etc."

I rather doubt that the book is still in print, but perhaps it would help to
raise the quality of rhetoric that is being hurled so muddily forth.

I'm not so startled that some folks continue to be so intensely offended by
a poetics that is not so very different from their own as I am saddened that
they waste their time thus. It would be far more interesting and fun, for
them as well as us, if they would just promote whatever it is that they
like.

1)
In the rush to D.C., I didn't take time to note here the passing of Roebuck "Pop" Staples, extraordinary guitarist, father of the Staples Singers and friend to many poets.  If you look at the back of the 70s era LP of the Staples Singers' Greatest, you'll see an excerpt from Plato's REPUBLIC as the liner notes! Pops was one of the few to successfully wed blues to gospel (like Thomas Dorsey and Sister Rosetta Tharpe!), and he loved lyric -- you can see him on the video of the Band's LAST WALTZ among other places -- He used to sing:

"What you gonna do when Death comes creeping in the room?"

but today I'll remember his incredible guitar while daughter Mavis sang:

"Are you sure your prayers haven't been answered?"

2)
As one of the readers not singled out for blame in the diatribe from Carlo Parcelli that was forwarded to this list a few days back, I dashed off a quick response in which I attempted to cast a much earlier reading by Carlo in similar terms, hoping thereby to indicate how a shoe might pinch on another foot.  However, forgetting that the reply function on my home system operates differently from the one at work, I apparently sent it only to Mr. Brennan himself, who forwarded it to Carlo.  The response was about what you'd expect.  While I was told by the forward Mr. Brennan that the original "review" was an instance of honest evaluation, CP found my comment about his own reading to be an instance of petulant attack.  Apparently these matters aren't so objective after all.

3) Following which, I read in this space that the only instances of living language in evidence at the DC reading the following night were on offer from Mark Wallace and Buck Downs.  Now I'll be the first to add my voice of praise to the chorus greeting Buck and Mark's wonderful work, but I've got to say, for the benefit of listafarians who couldn't attend either of the reading events "off-campus" during the MLA, that both provided far greater evidence of "living language" than did the "MLA MEMBERS READ THEIR FAVORITE POEMS" session, which I feel free to attack petulantly since I was also a part of that one (I read Niedecker, if you want to know), where even Keats was somewhat deadened in the performance.  Some of us are good performers, some are not, and it seldom has anything at all to do with the quality of the poem itself.  But, as you might well expect of readings involving dozens of poets writing out of quite varied aesthetics (despite what you read to the contrary in p
 osts to this list), things were considerably more diverse and pleasant than some let on.  I suspect that attendees willing to exercise a modicum of critical acuity could make some fairly interesting comparisons between a Waldrop and a Thomas, a reading by McAleavey and a reading by Willis perhaps even between a Downs and a Wallace -- In fact, some of us spent a few interesting moments doing just that on the long trip home. Some of us will even go so far as to read and reread some work by these poets to reach a fuller appreciation of what they're up to ----

But none of that sort of reporting or reflection was in evidence in these two early reports from the front, which still seem to me motivated by some larger animus against straw figures than by any interest in communicating anything at all about the poets and poetry that appeared to an audience of interested and critical readers.

i'm not a big title man myself but 'doctor' for me means something entirely
different from Ph. D. although I do have both.  when I see a doctor i want
to see someone with experience 'treating' patients with knowledge gained
through clinical training and when I take the role of doctor i want people
to respect my opinions based on that and not necessarily the number of years
I spent in school.  The rituals m.d.s and I experienced are in the end
important.

A very British answer to a befogged Kiwi. Actually my whole (or much of my)
picture of London (from whence my father) has been built up by Charles
Dickens (and various verbal reports) eg a  friend who assures me that their
are very many parks.And I have a book somewhere about Epping Forest etc.
Each of us has a book...Oh of course there's Orwell's books (one which
begins in an air raid with someone running out of a fire), and Conrad's "The
Anarchist" etc, a brilliant book by Golding. Re Eliot, that's my silly
little joke..but he may have got the idea from Charles. Then there's "Mrs
Dalloway" and what about Joyce Carey's book about the artist? Many of
Somerset Maughm's stories are set in London. Who else.....? Much of Eliot's
Waste Land. I read an interesting book by one of the few female Air Raid
Wardens. the reality becomes mixed with what one has read....
   Maybe it could be observed that certain prose is more beautifully
"poetic" than poetry proper (whatever that is!). "Jubilate Agno" (although
the (antiphon is it?)of that is missing) is more interesting than "David".
More interesting, but that doesnt nec. equate to "better" whatever that is.
Cheers. Richard.

The trouble is that these people wouldnt have the courage to read their own
work. They are critics and probably "losers" if I may borrow an Americanism.
Let them post their work on the list and we can all see what geniuses they
are.
 Some good natured heckling, or criticism which is specific would be more
useful. These critics have many places to read their own, and thousands of
mags to choose from.
 They sound negative and disgruntled and probably lack talent and are
arrogant. Richard Taylor.

Dear all,

Here are addresses for two websites re: the DC inauguration protests on
January 20th-- and some notes on the protest permit status- and transport
from NYC.

best,
Lisa Jarnot

The International Action Center is chartering a large number of buses for
the New York area to take demonstrators to Washington DC on January 20.
BUS DEPARTURE TIME AND LOCATIONS
Buses will depart at 5 am on January 20 from the following locations:
Manhattan: =A0=A0=A014th St. and Union Square West =A0=A0=A0=A0=A096th St. and Broadway
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0125th St. and Harlem State Office Building
Brooklyn: =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Grand Army Plaza/Brooklyn Public Library
PURCHASING BUS TICKETS
To ride on a chartered bus, you must purchase your bus ticket in =A0advance.=A0
The round-trip tickets are $30 ($25 for low income).=A0 Tickets can be
purchased from the International Action Center office.=A0 Tickets can be
purchased by check until January 16.=A0 Write checks to International Action
Center.=A0 IAC office hours are Monday - Thursday 10 am-8 pm; Friday 10 am-7
pm; Saturday 11 am-5pm.


The Partnership for Civil Justice=8Bthe DC-based attorneys who are
=A0representing the International Action Center and other =A0protesters=8Bhave
sent a letter to DC Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey, =A0United States Park
Police Chief Robert E. Langston, National Park =A0Service Director Robert
Stanton, and United States Capitol Police Chief James Varey.
The legal team is insisting that people who oppose the Bush =A0administration
have the right to express their opinion, to obtain permits and to
demonstrate their point of view in the area of the inaugural event. The
letter to the police requests specific information and clarification on
outstanding issues related to permits and police conduct on January 20. =A0Th=
e
legal team has given the police agencies until the close of the business da=
y
Monday, January 8, to respond.
Let us be very clear on our goal in this endeavor: We intend to obtain a
permit so that thousands of people can participate in a mass rally on
January 20.=A0 We are launching a campaign to uphold our rights that will use
all available legal avenues as well as public pressure.=A0 =A0
The IAC will be giving everyone a comprehensive report on the status of the
permits, outstanding legal issues and other tactics at our upcoming Regiona=
l
Organizers Meeting on Tuesday, January 9.=A0 It will be held at 6:30 pm at
Local 169 UNITE union hall, 33 W. 14th St. in New York City. =A0It is very
important for everyone who can to attend this meeting.
The police officials have been attempting to create a climate of fear and
confusion to deliberately dissuade thousands of people from demonstrating a=
t
the Bush inauguration.=A0 The police agencies have told the media that they
intend to set up check points along the inaugural route.=A0 This is precisely
the tactic that the pro-Bush forces used in Florida: setting up check point=
s
outside voting booths, especially in African American and Haitian
communities.
After having disenfranchised tens of thousands of voters in the general
election, the Bush administration wants to disenfranchise thousands of
protesters who want to exercise their First Amendment right to say "NO" to
the death penalty, racism and racist disenfranchisement, and to raise other
issues.
We are confident that we can defeat what has been a systematic level of
intimidation.=A0 To succeed, the IAC and it allies to employ every means at
our disposal. We will pursue every avenue available to us.=A0 This is because
we believe that the highest priority is to make sure that thousands and
thousands of people come to Washington, DC on January 20.
The right-wing Bush administration would like to guarantee that the =A0next
four years will be ones with no protests against racism, the death penalty
and war.=A0 But that is a fantasy because our movement is going to grow.
Again, make sure you organize to come to the January 9 Regional =A0Organizers
Meeting to get a full report, as well as to pick up flyers, posters,
stickers and bus tickets.=A0 It will be held at 6:30 pm at Local 169 UNITE
union hall, 33 W. 14th St. in New York City.

I'm scared to actually open the e-mail folder for poetics, it's WAY
too full, but I thought some of y'all might be interested in the fact
that January 2001 issue of The Wire, a British new music magazine
with an ecumenical agenda, includes five pages (with large pictures)
on Amiri Baraka.

Despite the general music/performance orientation, there's some
quotes on his relation to the Beats & a few other literary subjects.
There's also mention of his old Jihad recordings being re-issued by a
new label called Son Boy, as well as reprinting the Cricket, a mainly
music magazine he edited in, I think, the late 60s.

I subscribe to the Wire, but it shows up in stores here in Fort
Worth, so there's at good chance that at least those of you who live
in North America can find a copy at your local chain outlet:
Borders/Tower/HMV/B&N/Chapters etc.

Bests,

Herb

Actually, the comparison above doesn't fly.  Certainly many people without
Ph.D.s in literature, or any other field for that matter, may be able to
answer your questions.  Likewise if you want a serious question about
medicine answered, you may get the answer from someone without an M.D.
Answering questions is not the issue or the basis for comparison.  If you
want your appendix removed, you see a surgeon because s/he is officially
sanctioned to provide that service, and has provided society with something
of a guarantee that s/he is educated in the field.  If you want a
concentrated semester of intellectual work, plus three credits towards a
graduate degree, you see a Ph.D. for the same reason.  Yes, it is a matter of
licensing in all fields, and one must work his/her tail off to achieve such
licenses which are relatively rare in societies, and all societies value
them.  Hence the prestige which obtains despite the resentment from some
quarters.  In both medicine and literature, answers are generally a matter of
the consensus of so-called "experts."  How do we know, for example, that the
answers we receive to our questions about literature, from a non-degreed
respondent, are correct?  (At least we can be assured that the degreed
respondent SHOULD know.)  Is fame our criterion for placing confidence?  Or
is it finally our own ego-driven judgment we rely on?  And if the latter, do
we feel we can get away with this simply because the consequence is not a
severe pain in our abdomens?  The term "Doctor" is simply a designation, a
sign of respect, a recognition of achievement.  I don't know many, if any,
physicians and/or academics who spend their time crowing.  But I have
encountered quite a number of people, usually quite young, who think they
know more than they do, simply because they have misread a dozen books or so.
 As I said, I'm impressed by anyone with expertise I lack, whether or not
they're degreed.  Best, Bill

Ron Silliman responded to a negative review (I believe, by Carlo Parcelli)
by suggesting that there's no reason to be so searingly negative -- it's not
as if any of the 'offending' poets shit in anyone's sandwich.  I agree.  But
I find myself wondering about the argument implicit in the first part of Mr.
Silliman's post, excerpted below:

---

In 1955, after an evening of piano works by Cage and Stockhausen generated
much anger and scoffing at Wesleyan, RK Winslow, a professor of music at the
school, wrote a letter to the campus paper, the Argus, suggesting, as
follows:
"Those who were antagonized by the performance and who have run out of
descriptive terms for it, can find a variety of fresh insults in a book
called Lexicon of Musical Invective by Nicolas Slonimsky (Olin Library), a
compilation of on-the-scene reactions to the music of, e.g., Beethoven,
Bach, Mozart, Verdi, etc."

---

The argument here seems to be that some work is, in a sense, 'ahead of it's
time.'  The work's 'goodness' or 'quality' is always present -- just not
always realized when first presented.  The idea of a 'transcendent' quality
disturbs me.  I cannot argue, of course, against the phenomena described.
For example, I really enjoy Beethoven's "Grosse Fugue", which contemporaries
found "confused," "chaotic," even "abhorrent."

But the question that comes to me is, are those contemporaries 'incorrect'
because they dislike the piece?  Further, am I 'correct' because I like it?
These questions were exacerbated as I read Alan Sondheim's most recent
addition to the list, copied below:

---

I admit that I do not like this piece.  Am I just behind the times?  Am I in
a trough while there's a crest coming on?  Will the brilliance of this piece
be recognized by wiser people in decades to come?

The response that comes to mind is that don't like this poem because I
haven't yet fashioned a way to relate to this piece.  As time passes, we as
a culture come to create methods and means for incorporating artworks into
ourselves; we find a way to relate the work to ourselves.

There's no need for Mr. Parcelli (if, indeed, it was him) to so blatantly
dismiss the work of the poets he reviewed: he merely doesn't have a way (or
see the value) in relating those works to himself and what he sees.
Conversely, there's no real need to pick on people who appreciate more
traditional work; it's possible to develop deep and complex modes of
relating traditional art to contemporary issues.

Sincerely,
Josh

P.S.  I don't want to denigrate Mr. Silliman's larger point that personal
attacks are unwarranted and unhelpful; his post merely got me thinking.  And
I certainly don't mean to overly criticize Mr. Sondheim's work posted on the
Poetics List, some of which I find very powerful (such as "Water-shedding,"
"Up-to-date kings in meadows," "Women, Spartans, and Dangerous Things,"
"Dead in the w., "Nikuko tells the truth," and especially "cut out from the
archives:").

I wonder what such a lexicon as the "Lexicon of Musical Invective" would
look like if the terms/phrases were collected at a xavier cugat show.

i share with ron the personal preference of promoting what I like and
avoiding the slams.  i prefer to address people's words shared directly in
this venue as opposed to addressing their poetry regardless of where that is
shared.  if i were to criticize publicly the poetic writing i don't like, i
might not have any friends at all.  besides, many things here on this list
come in the form of (ir?)rational arguments, and treating such arguments
with a critical eye comes with different and clearer merits.  it's a
personal preference i share.  i resist writing criticism all of the time,
saving my energies for other things.

on the other hand, i must confess i find Carlo's input refreshingly frank,
in this otherwise backslapping literary world.  if someone were to trash a
reading of mine, i'd want it to be carlo.  he just might make me feel so
badly i'd rebound with a laugh.  and then I would not feel so bad after all.
seriously, from carlo i would be guaranteed a degree of frankness i've
become unaccustomed to, and i genuinely cherish critical honesty, regardless
of its objectivity.  i want opinions, and for opinions we need opinionated
people, especially informed opinionated people.  there are too many blank
stares these days.  look at my generation, x-ers who thrive on their lack of
affect.  carlo is far from the world of blank stares and speechlessness, and
for that he is a rare gem.  carlo and his frankness are together a good
thing in my opinion.

fortunately i feel secure enough to take some rejection.  oh if you all
could see the collection of rejection slips i proudly hang on my office
wall!  if you think carlo is rude, i found it much more rude to receive a
photocopied rejection slip that had, in terrible penmanship, "Sorry to say
no," scrawled on it.  I would have at least appreciated the attention of an
insult.  So, in a roundabout way, silence seems to be the biggest hurt.

Besides, if a person feels that some particular work of art is beyond
condemnation and rejection, then the artist or that person might not be
working hard enough.  it's hard work to make stuff people don't like or
understand. ;^)

let's look at this controversial quote once more:

"If the group reading of 22 poets staged at the Four Seasons Hotel last
night is endemic of American poetry today, then American poetry is dead"

Taking carlo's comment literally/logically, it seems to imply that "the
group reading of 22 poets staged at the Four Seasons Hotel last night is"
NOT "endemic of American poetry today."  Because i think carlo may not
believe american poetry is dead.  so what?  (doesn't anyone here except judy
roitman remember *modus tollens*?)   to be told that my poetry does not
signify that a category of literature is thriving means nothing to me,
except maybe that perhaps i need some well-deserved modesty.  if i were to
think that my poetry *did* signify the vitality of american poetry, then i
hope someone would give carlo a ring and let him know I need someone to set
me straight.  if on the other hand, carlo was implying that american poetry
is dead, then as a consequence of his statement, he was saying nothing at
all.  i think carlo's problem with american poetry is not that it's dead,
but that it's buried under its own, and society's, detritus.  he has a great
deal of justification to stand upon for that belief.

being told "you're not it" might feel hurtful or "mean spirited" to some,
but hey, i know i'm not the shit, and that's just fine if someone told me
that.  people who sincerely believe that they are the bard's macaw just
might need to be reminded they're not.  and carlo should be admired for
sharing his opinions.  perhaps he won't be admired for his frankness, but
i've come to expect that lack of savvy from people already.  so take it
easy, it's no big deal.  it's certainly not worth accusing the author of "If
the group reading of 22 poets staged at the Four Seasons Hotel last night is
endemic of American poetry today, then American poetry is dead" of
"intellectual vapidity."  it smacks of one-upmanship.

or, thank you for allowing me to make a bigger deal out of a little deal
that was at first a little deal and then a big deal.

Subject: The poetics of envy


In 1955, after an evening of piano works by Cage and Stockhausen generated
much anger and scoffing at Wesleyan, RK Winslow, a professor of music at the
school, wrote a letter to the campus paper, the Argus, suggesting, as
follows:

"Those who were antagonized by the performance and who have run out of
descriptive terms for it, can find a variety of fresh insults in a book
called Lexicon of Musical Invective by Nicolas Slonimsky (Olin Library), a
compilation of on-the-scene reactions to the music of, e.g., Beethoven,
Bach, Mozart, Verdi, etc."

I rather doubt that the book is still in print, but perhaps it would help to
raise the quality of rhetoric that is being hurled so muddily forth.

I'm not so startled that some folks continue to be so intensely offended by
a poetics that is not so very different from their own as I am saddened that
they waste their time thus. It would be far more interesting and fun, for
them as well as us, if they would just promote whatever it is that they
like.

To whom it may concern. I just received an email from Carelli. He =
maintains he has been excluded from speaking on the list for opposing =
censorship. OK. If its for opposing censorship that isnt a good reason. =
I say "if", as I dont know the full story. But the List should be an =
open forum. The List may still impose censorship (one probably always =
needs some) but we need open government.Let's not get too "politically =
correct": which can lead to muzzling of people with alternative views.
  The political process needs to be seen, not hidden. Carelli etc need =
to be given leave to speak. O.K. they could be less personal and give an =
analysis of what they think is wrong or "bad' about say Charles =
Bernstein's works etc. That would be acceptable surely. Or am I talking =
rubbish? Something I dont know about?
  Does anyone else know about this matter? The plot thickens dickens. =
Sorry, I couldnt resist that...but this is serious. Is there something =
rotten..?  Richard.

Subject:      Announcing Atelos #9, Forthcoming by Jalal Toufic
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Forthcoming
by Jalal Toufic

    Atelos is pleased to announce the publication on February 15, 2001 of
Forthcoming by Jalal Toufic.


About the book:
    In his masterpiece, Forthcoming, Jalal Toufic observes, "With regard to
the surpassing disaster, art acts like the mirror in vampire films: it
reveals the withdrawal of what we think is still there." This enormously
ambitious but exquisitely precise book takes its position just so "with
regard to the surpassing disaster." The notion is central to this work, not
as a philosophical term (though the book is grounded in philosophy) but as
the name of  a specific form of devastation -- one that is, sadly, the
ongoing
condition for cultures in a number of places in the contemporary world. A
culture in such a condition is one whose culture has been withdrawn from it.
To remedy the resulting deracination, dissociation, and dismay, as Toufic
writes, history (the things we are living through) "demands the resurrecting
efforts of writers, artists, and thinkers." Variously polemical, elegiac,
angry, compassionate, Forthcoming has the emotional force of a magnificent
symphony.


About the author:
    Jalal Toufic is the author of three previous books, Distracted (Station
Hill, 1991; Green Integer, 2000), (Vampires): An Uneasy Essay on the Undead
in Film (Station Hill, 1993), and Over-Sensitivity (Sun & Moon, 1996). His
video and installation works, which include Credits Included: A Video in Red
and Green (1995), Ashura: This Blood Spilled in My Veins (1996), and Radical
Closure Artist with Bandaged Sense Organ (1997), have been shown at Artists
Space in New York, at the San Francisco Cinematheque, The Lab, and the Yerba
Buena Cener for the Arts in San Francisco, the Pacific Film Archive in
Berkeley, the UCLA Film and TV Archive, XYZ Artists' Outlet in Toronto, the
Theatre de Beyrouth in Beirut, the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, and the
Centre international de poesie in Marseille. He co-edited a special issue of
the journal Discourse on Gilles Deleuze: A Reason to Believe in this World
and edited a special issue of the same journal on Middle Eastern Films Before
Thy Gaze Returns to Thee. He has taught at the California Institute of the
Arts, the University of  Southern California, and the University of
California at Berkeley. Jalal Toufic currently lives in Beirut, Lebanon.

About the project:
    Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of Hip's Road. It is devoted to
publishing, under the sign of poetry, writing which challenges the
conventional definitions of poetry, since such definitions have tended to
isolate poetry from intellectual life, arrest its development, and curtail
its impact. All the works published as part of the Atelos project are
commissioned specifically for it, and each is involved in some way with
crossing traditional genre boundaries, including, for example, those that
would separate theory from practice, poetry from prose, essay from drama, the
visual image from the verbal, the literary from the non-literary, and so
forth. The Atelos project when complete will consist of 50 volumes;
Forthcoming is volume 9. The project directors and editors are Lyn Hejinian
and Travis Ortiz; the director for production and design is Travis Ortiz;
cover production and design is by Ree Hall.

i haven't been active recently because i've been involved in a real-life
process infopoem which is now (I hope) finally starting to unfold.  It
begins in a couple of places but the first section is an infopoem i am
creting out of a few days expeience on an internet self-help support group
at http://members.tripod.com/~trbell/metaphor/fgid.htm

the continuation is the formation of a Latronex Action Group to generate
public interest and support (lotronex@egroups.com)
http://www.geocities.com/lotronexactiongroup/index.html (under construction)
I've just sent out a call for endorsement and support for people to give
their doctors and to send out to the professional community.  If it grows it
will become a thing of beauty as well as a piece of practical poetic impact.

tom bell


Dear Dr. ________:

I am a psychologist in private practice.  I am concerned about recent events
surrounding
the release and then recall of the drug Lotronex.  I am concerned about the
people
involved who were given a brief respite from the emotional and physical pain
of their
illness, only to have relief snatched away again.  I am also concerned about
a number of
scientific and social questions this raises and the impact on the public's
view of science. .

In March of 2000, GlaxoWellcome, Inc. restored the lives of hundreds of
thousands of
men and women who suffered with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a
little-understood and
currently incurable gastrointestinal disease which affects about twenty
percent of the
population. GlaxoWellcome's introduction of Lotronex (alosetron
hydrochloride) gave
freedom from fecal incontinence, physical and emotional pain, repeated
embarassment,
and lives turned upside-down.

Then in November of 2000, because of the inability of GlaxoWellcome and the
FDA to
come to an agreement, GlaxoWellcome withdrew Lotronex from the marketplace,
depriving these men and women of a successful treatment and leaving  their
lives again
in shambles.  As you may know, Lotronex gets at the underlying cause of
diarrhea-predominant IBS by blocking seratonin receptors in the gut.  At
present, no
other such medication exists.

I am a member of the Lotronex Action Group, which has formed on the
internet. It is
entirely independent and has no connection with any drug manufacturer or any
other
commercial interest.  The Lotronex Action Watch Group seeks the scientific
community's
cooperative effort in uncovering the issues surrounding the withdrawl of
Lotronex and in
promoting corrective action. As a fellow scientist, please join me in
endorsing this brief
statement and also pass it along to colleagues and co-workers for their
endorsement.

        The Lotronex Action Group has looked into available information
 regarding the unfortunate withdrawal of Lotronex from the market and
 has urged the parties involved to sit down and resolve their differences
 so that it can remain available in the best interest of patients.  The LAG
 especially urges that the medication be made available to those people
 currently taking it until the differences are resolved.
 As a [YOUR PROFESION], I endorse this statement ____________.


Further background explanation and information on the group, the events, and
the
treatment is available in the attached letter,  through the group
(latronex@egroups.com),
and on our website at
http://www.geocities.com/lotronexactiongroup/index.html.

Two reviews of mine that first appeared in _The Gig_ 7. --N

----

1) Tim Davis, _Dailies_.  Great Barrington, MA: The Figures, 2000.  $12.50
US.  0-935742-77-X.

_Dailies_ is a selection from poems written one a day as a self-imposed
discipline over the space of two years (1997-98).  Davis wrote in the
interstices of a 9-to-5 job, "during coffee breaks, morning blear, elevator
going up," as he notes in the preface.  Stylistically the book exists
somewhere on the continuum between the New York School & the Language Poets,
with _Lunch Poems_ the most formidable precursor, & Raworth's 1970s work &
Bernstein's mordant collages of workplace memos somewhere in there too.  But
such a rollcall doesn't do justice to the book's ability to pull something
improbably fresh & arresting out of the mix.  The poems run an upbeat
absurdism up against the pressures of the daily occupational grind; while
New York School poetry can have a poised elegance in which comedy coexists
with melancholia, Davis's poetry is pointedly inelegant--cramped & pressed
for time.  Puns, portmanteau words, deformed idioms and surreal turns of
phrase are brusquely joined together:

i say let the vietnam deniers write their blyric eyewool
fine, fine (louie, louie) a bust of lenny bruce in
blue recycled hand dyed exit polling ('atta) data
at once entirely of petit fours
another clumsy tooth fairy, another
orpheus and other stories
another world another world another you another you
lenny bruise, it is said, didn't "get" meltdown
instead (here it comes!)
                                      darkument
anyway the i-bomb merely deaccesorized, so go ahead an' croon

Davis's ear for parody is dead-on: "our founder had a tenor to shatter
 pyrex"; "you say 'ultimata'"; the effect is of phrases being pushed to the
point of absurdity & then past it, into a kind of abstract satire: "sprinkle
foibles onto press inking link dinka-do / truth in 'avert eyes-ing' o my /
mediocrity / is true too"; or

come inhabit
hate rooms with calartsy arc welding hobby horse
stand in the way of canvasses embarrassed to just be so
so they animatronically jiggle
crock of endive sponsored by the K of C, that's
"Kind of Conceptual"

_Dailies_ is one of the strongest collections to appear this year: a little
overwhelming in its sustained brio (though there are touches of other modes,
such as in the elegy "the death of alexis": "the light sounds vacant /
everyhow she sang we're flightless / screaming open-beaked") but nonetheless
compelling, delightful & memorable.


2) YOU KNOW HIM, READER

Kenneth Goldsmith, _Fidget_.  Toronto: Coach House Books, 2000.  107pp.
$16.95 Cdn.  ISBN 1-55245-076-7.  An online version is available at
<www.chbooks.com>.

On Bloomsday 1997 Kenny Goldsmith woke at 10:00; speaking into a microphone
attached to his body he described as exactly as possible his every physical
movement that day until he fell asleep at about 11:00 pm.  _Fidget_ is
constructed from that tape; the text, divided into sections according to the
hour of the day, begins at 10:00:

Eyelids open.  Tongue runs across upper lip moving from left side of mouth
to right following arc of lip.  Swallow.  Jaws clench.  Grind.  Stretch.
Swallow.  Head lifts.  Bent right arm brushes pillow into back of head.  Arm
straightens.  Counterclockwise twist thrusts elbow toward ceiling.  Tongue
leaves interior of mouth, passing through teeth.  Tongue slides back into
mouth.  Palm corkscrews.  Thumb stretches.

The style here--terse & neutral, scrubbed of the pronoun "I" and mostly
omitting mention of external objects--suggests Beckett's prose and
scrupulous stage-directions, a link the book's design (reminiscent of Calder
's austere Beckett editions) seems intended to accentuate.  As _Fidget_
progresses, the strain of the exercise begins to tell: actions are further
abbreviated, & the prose has by 18:00 devolved into a helpless string of
single words: "Reach.  Grasp.  Reach.  Grab.  Hold.  Saw.  Pull.  Hold.
Grab.  Push.  Itch.  Push.  Push.  Turn.  Walk.  Two.  Three.  Four.  Five.
Six.  Seven.  Eight.  Turn."  At 19:00 the text erupts into nonsense, first
gently ("Refinger.  Sneeze cross.  Length of fore wipes free.  Hand sad.")
and then more insistently: "Body is sit.  Licks wet.  Whistle this time.
Hey doe!  Betsit.  From chest: good girl!  Good Girl!"  What has
happened--this is only clear from the book's afterword--is that Goldsmith,
unnerved by his own experiment, has gone out & purchased & consumed a bottle
of whiskey.  Not just the alcohol-tinged nightmare & linguistic play of this
portion of the text recalls _Ulysses_, but also its evolution of styles
between chapters: though Goldsmith's tape presumably went through continuous
stylistic change, the final artifact abruptly changes modes from chapter to
chapter.  The text's last section--22:00--is not a transcription of the (now
unintelligible) tape but a reversed version of the 10:00 text, in which each
action is mirror-imaged ("left" becomes "right," "forward" becomes
 "backward") & then printed, letter by letter, in reverse.

I've named some literary antecedents for the text but in many ways the book
is as much akin to conceptual art or the music of John Cage or Morton
Feldman.  The piece was originally commissioned by the Whitney Museum as a
collaboration with the singer Theo Bleckmann; unusually for a new poetry
publication it is accompanied by a full-length essay (by Marjorie Perloff),
rather in the manner of an exhibition catalogue.  As with such modes of art
one of its primary concerns is about attention & attentiveness.  Fidgeting
is an activity that receives most exaggerated form in a person subjected to
stress or to boredom; if the author here succumbed to the former in the
original exercise, the text can make the reader fidget at the minimally
differentiated canvas that the first two thirds of the text present, &
respond almost cathartically to the linguistic implosion of the last
sections.  Yet if discomfort & tedium are intrinsic to the experience of
reading the text, so are the unpredictable moments where they disappear in
the terrible comedy of a mind & body trapped in mutual discomfort, as when
the text details Goldsmith's (successful) attempt to touch his nose with his
toe, or his (it seems nervously frequent) pilgrimages to the bathroom to
urinate, or the impassive notation towards the conclusion of masturbation:
"Blood rushes out of penis."  _Fidget_, true to its title, is a
discomforting work; if I remain uncertain of my reaction to it, I have
little doubt it will prove one of the most distinctive books of the last few
years.

Hey has anyone heard of any rumors about publishing a selected or collected  poems of David Rattray? I had never heard of him until yesterday when I ended up hearing an old tape of him reading with John Wieners. (at the poetry project in 1985-- was anyone on the list there---?) I guess he has that book on drugs "How I Became One of the Invisible" on Semotext, but it doesn't look like any of his poetry books are in print anymore.  It's such a shame.  I was so blown away by his reading. Every line surprised me and seemed full of transience and light.  I'm looking at the poem now from the St. Mark's anthology "This Began Long Ago." I love the way he moves from talking about a friend's father dying to "the faces leaders make in the privacy of their bathroom." He manages to capture the simultaneous feeling of being outside of oneself while at the same time the almost paradoxical feeling of loneliness within oneself.  Why had I never heard of him? I never thought I lived under a ro
 ck.

(I did notice he has a link on Gary's Readme webcite so I guess someone is still reading him)

best,

Joanna Fuhrman

Thanks for this---

and Grummon, Baptiste and others---

I guess there's two points---
while I was hoping not to create, or emphasize, or encourage
a division between poets or writers or thinkers or performers
or whatever you wish to call it (us/?), who have Ph.Ds'
and those (of the same) that do not have Ph.Ds,
my rhetoric, quite obviously, seemed to argue a kind of "special pleading"

and thus most of you understandably directed most of your attention
to the seeming assumptions of privilege and hierarchies
invoked (as if there was lament in their lack)--

But that was (and is) not the point, the lack or the lament
I guess I was looking for an external reference
against which something like a community
could come into being, in which perhaps
we may start thinking of ways we need not deny ourself
things like healthcare if we continue to wish to pursue
the "purposeful purposelessness" (for want of a better phrase----shorthand)
of writing, considering the possibility that maybe
writing is not necessarily irrelevant to society,
or at least more of those in "nonpoetic" professions
such as doctors---as if believing in my heart---oops, essentialism--
that they need us as much as we need them.
I meant, and mean, to be inclusive....
or of course one could say I was (am) just trying to find, or target,
new markets, but barter is fine......the passive lure
.......

Poet Daniel Krakauer died yesterday (Jan. 5) after protracted struggles
with a number ailments. There will be a funeral for him this Sunday (Jan.
7) at the Gramercy Funeral Home on Second Ave. between Ninth and Tenth
Streets in Manhattan.

From Daniel Krakauer's poem "As Told by An Old Buddhist Monk"

In my youth, in the monastery
Of Rishnapoor the student monks were asked
One day 'what is your life' and after
Much chewing of fingernails one of their number
Wrote down "your life is that interesting movie
It takes you a whole lifetime to watch"
The master took one look and said to him
I want to see you when class is over ...

Sam Edwine says "Hi-hi" to a bum in Foo-Chow

(Marco Polo went there, too)

by Tom Bradley


"Quit your farting."

--Chairman Mao, The Little Red Book


The commies had kicked his family out, and now they were after Sam.  So
he decided to take a walk, to search for a means of personal salvation.
 As he lumbered down Derelict Hell Road, he came upon a likely
prospect.


Glistening black with filth, and naked but for a few rags that ended at
the thighs and armpits, the guy looked a bit like a far-eastern version
of Sam himself in his bachelor days, before his wife got hold of him
and cleaned him up.  Best of all, this bum was wadded in an old and
ill-maintained handicap trike.


It might not be a bad idea to hunker down in front of this saint, to
put elbows on the false-cripple knees and do a little fast talking.
The standard slow-motion eyes rolled up and focused on Sam only after
he was settled comfortably in.


Sam began:  "Perhaps you could lend me some of your wisdom, for I'm in
a quandary.  It may sound like a Jesus complex to you--and maybe it's
even a mild one compared to your own, as you sit here weeping
blood--but there are several groups of people in this town vying with
each other to see who can nail me first.


"Now I'm asking you, possibly the observer, victim and perpetrator of
more than one crucifixion:  shall I give these godless pricks the
satisfaction of capturing me and deporting me after a little marketably
sordid stuff in jail?  Or shall I go fishing instead?


"Letting them bust me would offer the fair likelihood, or at least the
fighting chance, that I could go public with the charges against me, if
I survived.  That would give me a crack at notoriety and financial
independence.


"I'd have to recruit a ghostwriter.  Like they say:  two weeks in
China, write a book; two months in China, write an article; two years
in China, write nothing.  But, you know, I'd certainly be svelte enough
for the talk show circuit after a few months in the people's prison.
I've got a fair start on it now, don't you think?"


Sam smoothed his hands down his sides and leered sidelong at his mute
interlocutor, who moaned once absently.


"Now, the disadvantages we'll count up on your little bare black toes,
like marketing piggies.


"One:  They'd fly me back on a China Airlines death-trap, and I'd have
take a chance on ptomaine from the Salisbury steak.


"Two:  my adopted daughter, bless her dewy soul, would have to settle
for being parented by an international criminal, a C.I.A.-betraying,
counter-spying daddy who was thrown out of her homeland on the
equivalent of a Mann Act rap.  She could never return thirty years
hence to witness the glorious results of the Four Modernizations and
learn about her rich cultural heritage and shit like that."


The bum suddenly laughed.  Had he understood, or had he made up some
random funny of his own?


"On the other hand," continued Sam, "I could sneak off and go fishing
in the Straits with your 'fraternal compatriots' from Taiwan, who hang
around the phony show port.  I know their lingo, for most of them are
lucky escapees from this very town.  They would allow themselves to be
bribed with some nice herbal medicine or powdered pearl cream.  And,
like the person who hates him/herself in the morning, they would beg me
to keep the ride to freedom and Big Macs a secret, so their mainland
typhoon-haven privileges wouldn't be revoked.  No publicity value to be
had by that route.


"There are no snitches from either government among the tightly-knit,
profit-bonded crews, and it would be the first time in two years that
I'd be free of such ticks and fleas.  And even if the Reds did find
out, they would never publicize such an embarrassing method of escape.
'Look,' the world would say, 'even their foreign experts are sneaking
over to Taiwan!'


"So my kid's childhood would be secure and obscure.


"But there would be disadvantages to this route as well."  Sam looked
up at the placid, filthy sky.  "I'd have to stick around here with you,
and I do mean 'stick'--"  He peeled one dungareed knee off the
sidewalk.  "--until typhoon season got into full swing and the
fishermen started showing up.  And then I might die in the very storm
that brought my saviors.  Or I might get seasick, which is worse than
death, as far as I know.  What do you think?


"Also, they may be rich spies, but I've heard their boats are floating
petri dishes for hepatitis A, B and C, plus tetanus, tuberculosis,
dysentery, dyspepsia and dysfunctions of whatever organs you care to
list, not to mention backaches from midget-sized berths.


"Besides, I'd have to get a job when I finally got home, because no
publisher would believe I was telling the truth and things called
novels don't sell."


At the mention of the word 'job,' anguish geysered from Sam's outsized
hiatal hernia.  He grabbed the bum by the crawly rags around his
throat.  By this point it had slipped his mind that he was kneeling in
mucus and actually touching someone unwashed.  And this was the
self-same Sam Edwine who had given himself a rare dose of male anorexia
from fear of the unclean utensils in socialist restaurants.  He was
either making gradual progress or deteriorating rapidly.  In either
case, he pushed forward and gazed into the raw face.


"What'll I do?  I can't swim fast like the skinny comrades who wind up
peopling the gay district in Hong Kong.  And the commie-bred and
-planted hammerheads would be attracted from nautical miles around by
the drainage from my itched-open mosquito bites.  Anyway, how could I
get down to Kowloon in the first place, clear across mountains and
provincial borders, with an A.P.B. hanging over my head?"


Sam eyed the bum's wheeled conveyance and added, "I do have a ruse in
mind, a Yankee-style scheme, that might smuggle my bright bulk as far
as the show port, where I could link up with the Guomindang."


He considered it a while.  Escape seemed so bothersome.  It would be
much easier to acquiesce, like this rolled-over variety of lone
Chinaman, and wait to be swept away like dog shit.


"You must be one of those guys my age," said Sam, "the 'lost
generation' who can't do anything because the Great Proletarian
Cultural Revolution blew you out like light bulbs.  You can't even sit
up straight while you beg, but slouch flat on your back in your
wheelchair, your pelvis poked forward, your head propped at a ninety
degree angle--just like me most of the time, except I have a bed and a
pillow and a book by Foucault to make it look legitimate.


"Back home in Utah, whenever I saw a huddled mass of your counterparts
outside the Sugar House White Slum Blood Plasma Donor Center, I always
went among them and asked, with sincere bewilderment, 'Why don't you
guys become grad students like me?  Why peddle your precious bodily
fluids?  I know 5000 dollars per year doesn't sound like much, but it's
about 4987 dollars and fifty cents more than you dribble from your
elbow crotches now.  Besides, if you schedule everything carefully (pud
profs in classes you take; peer evaluation in classes you teach), it
works out to be about forty dollars per hour.  And if you can keep
little Thumbelina inside your pants during lectures, you can even get a
Ph.D.  Or just mail out for one from the back pages of Hustler
Magazine, as you collect your fellowship stipend and rack up the
federally insured student loans.  Then you can become a foreign expert
in some hopeless third-world shit-hole whose barbaric Deans of
Humanities don't know any better, like Borneo or Sumatra or the
People's Republic of China.'


"Of course, you, my grimy friend, can't do that, because you're already
here, unfortunately for you, and you have no place toward which to be
downwardly mobile.  But you can see some parallels forming, can't
you?"


Sam nudged him in the protuberant floating ribs.


"You must have some gumption under all that real estate, having avoided
the police, who, like the soldiers of King Shuddhodhana, pack your
unpresentable kind off to closed cities or god knows where:
crematoria, perhaps, or glue factories, where nobody important like an
American tourist will see you and know you exist."


No response was forthcoming, not even to this veiled compliment.  Had
it been expressed in too condescending a tone?  Maybe the guy didn't
know his own town's idiom.  Sam resolved to get a rise out of him, one
way or another.


He snuggled and swished, "You be Therese Defarge and I'll be Miss
Pross, m'kay?  Just back off, you slut!  I push my saggy bosoms out at
you, ooooh!"  He dug his upper body into the bony, death-smelling lap.


Nothing.


"Pull yourself together, young man!" cried Sam.  "You've got to make a
better showing than this!  Do something, and put your heart and soul
into it!  You've got to think big and have gumption!  Don't be afraid
to set out and go to new places on your own!  You can tackle any
adversary singlehandedly, if you'll only show me a little old-style
Kipling liberalesque gumption!  Come on!


"Look at me, for example."  (Sam's mouth was getting tired; that last
came out 'fur-zampo.')  "Short of injuring my large person, there's
nothing bad China can do to me.  This country is impotent in terms of
psychological retribution.  You probably think that if I got deported
I'd have to go home in shame to total ostracism and face-loss, like
you're suffering right now.  But face counts for less than nothing in
an isolate place like America, in what your propagandist 'philosophers'
used to call a social-Darwinist society.  And ostracized from whom?
Nobody, with a capital N, is the work unit Americans like me belong to.
 Even if I brought home the highest Chi-com accolades and a vita
plumper than Mao's hemorrhoids, I'd wind up working a shit-job at
Seven-Eleven.  For I'm a mere male Anglo Saxon, and therefore have
nothing to offer, of course.  Lumpen intelligentsia all the way, and
proud of it!


"We Americans are, in your Confucian context, sociopaths; and, though
our society and culture are finished, we are the only free people on
earth, for we are perfectly, sublimely faceless.  We're shameless.


"That, and not all the milk and beef we gorge on, is what makes us so
huge and mean and hairy.  So watch your skinny, inhibited ass, Boy!


"China--all of this, the forty-year-old smog, the
four-thousand-year-old street, the incredible inch-thick jam under your
toenails here--it's just been a cheap, irrelevant vacation for me:  a
way of forestalling adulthood another couple years; a financially
neutral expenditure of dead time; busywork to prepare me for the true
man's labor of placing pickles and cheese on a sesame seed bun and
nickels in a cash register, eight hours a day.  You and your
most-ancient-of-all-civilizations and your one-in
every-four-faces-on-earth have been a way to kill time, nothing more.


"China, the world's biggest post-graduate school."


The bum rolled his head to one side and spat a plump yellow lunger on
Sam's hand.  The glistening globule nestled and quivered warmly in the
web between Sam's thumb and forefinger.  It was more of a response than
he'd gotten in years of classroom teaching.


"Okay, fine.  You have done something.  I'm glad you felt comfortable
enough to share with me.  Let's talk about this now.  It's a wise
choice of activity in your case, a natural vocation, you might say.  By
now, of course, it is a commonplace among the educated classes that Mao
Zedong-- "


The bum twitched at the name as though at a bee sting.


"--was an oral personality leading an anal nation.  But I say you're
all nasal types.  Nasal expulsives.  So please, lie there and follow
your natural bent.  Snort a little something back and expel it!


"But," said Sam, rising to his feet, "be the very best spitter you can
be.  Make yours the biggest spit on the block.  Here, watch this--"


He inserted two of his more expendable left-hand fingers deep into his
throat and twiddled his soot-sore uvula, waiting for the standard
results.  He was only sorry there was no party representative within
reach.  But then, in mid-gag, he thought better of it.


"Enough of that," he murmured, and withdrew his hand.


Then, feeling lighter, he stripped down to his novelty teeshirt, which
read, zi jingshen wuran zhe.  I am a spiritual self-polluter.


Finally, the embryonic sense of paternal responsibility long impending
inside this man, who'd been expelled from his last American university
post for displaying little evidence of the nurturing instinct, came to
full term and was born squealing and bleeding.  It was time to get back
home and link up with his wife and daughter.


But before his total-immersion baptism in meconium, he wanted to have
one last fling in the Shipu Harbor Reception Center.  He would lounge
around the diesel-redolent beach until the typhoon came, then he'd find
a likely-looking trawler full of counterrevolutionaries to ease him
across the Straits of Formosa.


"Your axles look a little orange, Comrade, but my big hands on the
crank will wrench them loose.  I think I'll blow my last few kuai on a
dumped Hitachi television set and strap it to your luggage rack, a gift
for the belated family reunion in Salt Lake City.


"My kid will probably have forgotten the identity of her dad in the
meanwhile, but I can play with her non-stop a few days and fix things
up between us, before I hit the help-wanted ads.


"So, it's settled.  Goodbye, sick asshole of the east.  You'll forever
regret inviting this man in--and, even more, letting him slip out."


Sam laid hands on the derelict's legs, to move them gently off the
trike, simultaneously elaborating a string of drool and mumbles to flap
over his shoulder in the breeze for added authenticity as he rolled
along.  By way of disguise, he wadded the bum's linty lap-blanket under
the back of his shirt to resemble a hunch.


"Come on, dead-butt.  This is a legit act of requisitioning.  Get your
arm out of your pants and help."


He felt something sharp move up against the palm of his hand, squeaking
like styrofoam as it pierced the flesh.  For an instant, just before he
swatted the blade and derelict away, Sam Edwine almost became mindful
of the agony of this place.</smaller></fontfamily>

i'm incapable of saying anything authoritative. stemming from an inability
ever to best my father when growing up. he always had to have the last
word. in. i never believe what i'm saying or writing or about to say. that
gives me no followers, no credence, and a skeptical, overly critical, and
dubious attitude towards the world at large. (did i say that?) if i coin a
neologism, i accompany it with a sense of shame; why couldn't i express
myself more clearly. my work is filled with far too many irrelevant refer-
ences (unlike, say, the work of Wittgenstein), giving the text a sense of
legitimation which is often nothing more than a masquerade.

i'm at a loss for words. i'm hideously ugly. i can't go out in the day. i

these senses, i'm ideal canon fodder for online culture, this skittered
orality, a culture constantly transforming down to the very bit and byte -
a letter that is here, now, may be gone tomorrow. i don't have to own up
to anything. i can write the way others breathe. i don't have any choice.
everything exacts too high a toll. i don't have to see anyone ever. i
don't have to be anyone at all. i can hardly write this. i can hardly
think, it's so hard to think. this letter is gone tomorrow. i can hardly
think.

Dear Poetics List,

Sometime back I wrote asking for recommendations of
works of fiction that might also be seen as poetry. A
number of people wrote the list and others wrote me
directly. For what it's worth, the list that came out
of that (minus a few non fiction items that people
suggested) appears below. Needless to say, this list
doesn't reflect my judgements or any one of the people

To the drawing board:

we have a choice of two models under which we may generally evaluate the
tacit argument Carlo forms with his controversial statement:

if x then y
not y
therefore not x
(modus tollens)

or


if x then y
y
therefore (null)

Either carlo was implying either *not y* or *y* where y is "American poetry
is dead."

I find Aldon to be entirely correct that Carlo's use of endemic appears
awkward.  Though I think Carlo's usage of it (for you Wittgensteinians out
there) seemed pretty straightforward, and since the sense is relatively
clear, this particular critique of Aldon's seems to take to splitting hairs
almost as much as my argument takes to high school pedantry.  Alas, I find
myself none the better.

But back to the logic.... The use of Carlo's sentence either (a) means
nothing or (b) coordinates with a tacit assumption, since the statement IS A
CONDITIONAL.  That tacit assumption is either *not y* or *y*.  If his
statement (a) means nothing, then there is little worth fussing about.  If
the statement coordinates with a tacit assumption then it would likely be
either one that reacts with the conditional (not y, a modus tollens
reaction) or he is making a logical fallacy.

So now either (a) carlo is saying nothing, (b) carlo is saying that the
reading is not all there is to indicate that american poetry is alive, or
(c) carlo is saying that american poetry is dead, and he shared this
statement and used it fallaciously.  Are you with me here?  I happen to
believe Carlo does not think american poetry is dead.  i think he believes
it is suffering under a weight of the sort that america at large is
suffering under.  So I believe that (b) carlo is saying that the reading is
not all there is to indicate that american poetry is alive.  You know what?
That is no big deal, or it shouldn't be.

Now, the logical approach does "deaden" the emotive content.  Sure, sure,
sure.  Could that statement of Carlo's cause some amount of pain, or be
considered hurtful?  You bet.  Clearly it has.  But I am saying that such
hurt is not so bad a thing, because to be hurt personally by this is also to
hold a tacit belief that somehow the 22 readers ARE the sole sign that
american poetry is alive.  I think if that statement were put in this light
to those readers that evening in DC, (I hope and expect) many would answer
to a sort of modesty about their work.

Carlo's statement is controversial only to those who actually think they ARE
the future of American poetry.  And those people, frankly, need all the
controversy they can(not?) handle.

Upon evaluating the OED, perhaps Carlo is using "American poetry"
metaphorically, as a person, as a body, a corpus.  That does not require too
much imagination to recognize, and it is well within Carlo's writing habits.
Besides, isn't language really just the regular application of metaphor?  Uh
oh, better leave that one alone.  Anyway, Carlo's statement seems to use the
word "endemic" properly, *and in the primary sense of the word*.

Perhaps Carlo's statement was regarded as hurtful because the word "endemic"
does have the tertiary overtone of "diseased."  "Of diseases" is the
tertiary definition of the word "endemic" according to the OED, Aldon.  The
primary and secondary definitions in the OED are consistent with your
reference, Aldon.  So his statement seems to me a mild putdown, but one that
uses loaded words like "endemic" and "dead" and as a result becomes a bit
heavy-handed.  But that's what I like about what Carlo adds to the world of
poetry.  He's direct and uses strong language.  Carlo doesn't beat around
the bush, and he sets people back in their places.  I myself have been put
in my place by Carlo, and deservedly so.

Thanks Aldon for sharing your comments.

Patrick

Doesn't anyone here except me find this peculiar?  If we in fact take the
comment literally, we have to take "endemic" to mean "belonging to or
native to a particular people or country" or "restricted to or peculiar to
a locality or region."  In either event, the preposition seems awkward.
But in neither event could the sentence be read as excluding other forms of
possibly still living poetry -- so that the logic of the statement is an
assertion that if the poetry read that night is peculiar to America, then
all American poetry is dead.  If that makes any sort of sense to anybody,
I'd be very surprised -- though I confess I haven't had time to get to an
OED to find out if Carlo was harking back to some dead definition of
"endemic" that might make sense of this sentence -- To my reading, this
loose usage is striking . . .

Hi Joanna,

I love David Rattray's work ... even though like an idiot when I
moved to NYC from MPLS I sold both How I Became One of the Invisible
and Opening of the Eyelid (along with like 1,000 other wonderful &,
okay, some not so wonderful books), the latter of which was published
by David Abel, a poet & book fiend who lives in Oregon, though I
can't remember his press name. No wait, it was called "diwan." I
think David lived in Brooklyn, probably with Mitch Highfill, or
around that time anyway, when he published that book. But, maybe it
was later, in the southwest? (New Mexico somewhere?) Can't remember.

I'd forgotten about this, but Rattray's got a long poem, "Mr.
Peacock," in the last issue of Barbara Henning's LONG NEWS. I mean,
literally her last issue -- she gave it up. It's issue 5, by the way.
It was a great magazine, always had groovy semi-obscure poets like
Don David, Lynne Dryer, Lorenzo Thomas (though he's no longer so
obscure, I guess). The cover of issue 5 has a kind of ghostly picture
of Rattray, from an artpiece by Carolee Schneemann, an installation
piece, of people she knew (?) who'd died. Oh, there's a poem by John
Godfrey in there, too, called "Mull's Least Moan," which I think is a
kind of tribute to Rattray. Yes, you can borrow it.

There's another book of Rattray's I've always seen referred to, To
the Consciousness of a Shooting Star. I don't know who published it,
but I'll bet Barbara or Mitch or Drew Gardner (another Rattray fan we
know) does. Or someone. I love that title, but probably I love it
knowing what Rattray's poetry is like, so it carries a kind of weight
or something.

Oh, he also did this translation of Roger Gilbert-Lecomte, Black
Mirror, which is not only still in print, but cheap (ten bucks).
There's a translation too of something by Rene Crevel. I never found
it. I can't remember if the Gilbert-Lecomte stuff was interesting. I
mean, to me. It was too long ago!

I just remembered: Do you know Emile Nelligan? The Canadian symbolist
poet? I "discovered" him via Rattray's book "How I Became One of the
Invisible," which is about drugs, as you say, sure, but also about
poetry. There's a great essay on Artaud in there, too. I think the
City Lights Artaud collection has Rattray translations ... hold
on ... yeah, I just checked, and it does. Artaud Anthology. Which I'm
pretty sure is still in print.

I think some people do read Rattray, still, but yeah okay not many
people. Do you know The Utne Reader? It's a kind of hodge-podge
magazine made up of so-called "liberal" media stuff? It's published
in Minneapolis, and there's this guy who I think still works there as
an editor, who used to live here in NYC, Jon Spayde (isn't that a
cool name?), who totally *loved* Rattray. I mean, he knew him,
personally. I met him in MPLS, and he would go on & on about Rattray,
and I would of course listen with my mouth hung open, because I had
read these two books, plus some of the translations, and thought he
was great, you know. And Jon would fill my head with stories about
Rattray's outrageousness. Mitch, too, has done so since.

I think Rattray died of a brain tumor. Something awful like that.
Which is awful and ironic I guess, considering how brilliant he was.
But, I don't know, drugs? Or smoking? (Did he smoke?) Or something? I
don't know what contributed to that.

When you say:

"He manages to capture the simultaneous feeling of being outside of
oneself while at the same time the almost paradoxical feeling of
loneliness within oneself" ...

I totally know what you mean. It's eerie, and I'm not sure, but I
always wondered if that didn't have something to do with the kinds of
drugs he was likely doing. Like how I feel when I read Schuyler's The
Crystal Lithium," which is actually very similar. (The feeling I get
reading it; if not necessarily the work, though actually kind of,
yeah, except Schuyler's more chatty or something and Rattray more
bookish?) This sense of someone distant from their body, like a husk
they've shucked.

I'm sorry to have gone on so long about Rattray. But I guess I'm
amazed someone posted something about him, and also, I think he's
great and I probably have guilt feelings associated with selling his
books. (Which, stupidly, I thought I'd've found by now! But obviously
haven't.)

Someone definitely should do a collected. A selected would be weird,
because he didn't write (or publish?) all that much. But, who would
publish this? I can't imagine.

Thanks for talking about your experience of a poet's work on this
list! I didn't think people did that anymore ...

Gary

Subject:      Fiction as Poetry addenda and Carole Maso
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Poetics List,

I realized soon after posting my last missive that I
had forgotten a couple of suggestions for the List of
Fiction as Poetry. Here are the one's that I've
recalled (and there are probably more);

Jean Genet -- various
Virginia Woolf -- Mrs.Dalloway, The Waves

Also, since collating all these suggestions I have had
the chance to comb a few bookstores and have found and
purchased a number of things. The book I started
reading today is Aureole by Carole Maso. It's great,
and certainly fits for me both in poetry and fiction.

Maso's introduction discusses poetry a bit and is very
interesting for many reasons. Here are a few
selections from it;

"...I do believe there might be ways in language to
express the extreme, the fleeting, the fugitive states
that hover at the outermost boundaries of speech.
        This book was written in a blur of desire, passion
pressing these pieces into shapes. Desire imposed its
own excesses, demanded I abandon myself to the trance
of language---its heat, its weight, its erotic slur.
Line by line I have tried to slip closer to a language
that might function more bodily, more physically, more
passionately. I have tried to feel the sexual
intoxication of the line or page or narrative, to
create and open space where pleasures and arousals
spread in a lateral radiance, an aureole of desire. If
I felt that I was doing something which I already knew
how to do well, the rule was to start again, to
attempt to break habitual patterns of mind and
expression. I've tried to write into the heart of
longing, of regret, unsure once I was there how I
would get back.
        In this time of witness, of storytelling, I've tried
to allow myself to walk into forgetfulness,
dissolution..."

        "I have started to think more and more about how
these urgencies create new formal structures. One of
the greatest pleasures has been exploring the sexual
energy of the sentence, the erotic surge of the
phrase. Poets, of course, are quite adept at such
things, but it has taken me, the prose writer, a long
time to get here. I love the ability to create new
logics: a logic of passion, a logic of the body
dramatized by where the line breaks, or the paragraph,
a logic of passion created in the ceasuras, in the
gaps, where unexpected tensions can produce palpable
sensation. A physical gathering of linguistic forces
might propel the reader to a point where, finally, all
pressures are brought to bear on a single startling
word or phrase."

I think this is beautiful, perhaps making any
judgement of it's being poetry or fiction or essay or
all of the above beside the point.

Sincerely,
Marla Jernigan

Subject:      Two more reviews
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

These are two further reviews I did for _Gig_ 7; I'd originally not posted
them mostly because they are negative reviews of work by a couple
listmembers; however, one of the authors in question wrote backchannel to
encourage my posting the review, so here we go.  Some of the formatting in
the 2nd sentence of the Doris review can only be approximated here (italics,
small-caps, full-caps, underlining). --N

----

3)
Stacy Doris, _Paramour_.  San Francisco: Krupskaya, 2000.  $9 US.
1-928650-05-8.

Stacy Doris's latest book is an addition to the experimental poetry
community's growing field of "antiqued" poetry & book-design.  Its poems
have titles like "Pierce and Plow, Men (Love Manual for Pirates)," "A-Wooing
Warring Ditty," "_Blaze of Livid Love_ / _Couplets of a one in pain_" or
"Song of the Piper's _Innocence_, THIS' Signature Poem," & the book is
liberally sprinkled with italics, capital letters & small-caps.  It is
organized ambitiously as a large-scale palindrome, so that poems & sections
echo across the book, sometimes loosely & sometimes strictly ("Gesture of
Song A. // FIVE MAN'S MORE" on p.59 becomes p.86's "ROMANCE V // A Song of
Gesture").  Such a scheme recalls Michael Haslam's _Continual Song_ (1986),
whose pages are numbered both backwards and forwards, & which has a similar
interest in harnessing earlier genres & verse forms to a contemporary idiom.
Yet Doris's book is lightweight when set against the work of Haslam, Lisa
Robertson or Martin Corless-Smith (to name some pertinent predecessors),
with a comparatively superficial grasp of the poetries she pillages.  That
is not necessarily a bad thing; yet the result is a very uneven book.
Pleasurable & effective moments (often coming when the verse is most
compressed) are interleaved with much undistinguished writing, such as
(e.g.) Doris's stab at alliterative verse:

The commander of corsets came through her
layers of needful numb nuns, because reason
rules them.  A lot in the day lights of love dies.
Delight drowns when less drunk but through wine
throw women once won.  Their fleshy fenders
foul to gander.  Wise as a weasel, lay 'long
them daughters.  Why look, since knowing hurts?

Krupskaya could perhaps have more gracefully rendered the author's
conception: in her note "To the Reader" Doris indicates that "each page
offers a composition expressly hand-crafted for 8 1/2 x 11 standard white
'multi-purpose' paper."  Reformatted to standard paperback size, many of
these pages look squeezed, especially the many passages in double or triple
columns; unimaginative typesetting doesn't help either, a uniform typeface &
point size being applied even to titles & section divisions when what the
text calls out for is a helpful & innovative layout like that of Robertson's
_Debbie: An Epic_.  Yet the real problem is that there's insufficient
substance here, despite the charm of the book's eroticism, which commingles
both love's childishness & its violence in a cryptic narrative that involves
lovers named "This" & "Thus."  I could do with less of things like her
version of Blake--

Pipe drives the kids wild,
     Piping sprinkles bright goo,
In a cloud of chewy fluid,
     And Pipe laughing sing to all:

'Pipe a game about a Toy!'
     So kids pop with happy guns.
'Pipey peek in fun again;'
     So shoot too to tickle here.

'Dip that pipe, you lucky ones;
     Grab the parts of Happy Stick!'  [etc.]

--& instead more of the book's terser writing, which might lend more
convincing support to Sianne Ngai's back-cover claim that _Paramour_ is a
"technical marvel":

Drifts bundle roots coil, tangle, mass, crowd, burst, recoil, shoal, unravel
light, the roots blind flames, bind shower bundle

tear, crawl, This crouch on Thus face, Thus thrust tongues, thick smell spin
Thus head

Honey suckles, juices green bundle, thin hoods white stems, the roots,

Wasted, thin, wind shade.


4)
Brian Kim Stefans, _Angry Penguins_.  New York: Harry Tankoos Books, 2000.
72pp.  $9 US.  0-9678031-1-X.

Stefans' third book-length collection is framed by two references to
non-American poetic sources.  The title is that of the Australian magazine
that fell victim to the Ern Malley hoax (see the feature in _Jacket_ 1),
while the book's first section, "The Overtures of Holograms," first appeared
in _Jacket_ 4 as the work of "Roger Pellett," a UK writer educated at
Cambridge who gave up on poetry at age 30 & migrated to the States to become
"a private environmental contractor."  (The fictive biography is reproduced
here as a prefatorial note.)  Stefans has previously shown a marked interest
in UK poetry, so one assumes the project is a playful experiment in the
poetic style of Prynne, Wilkinson, Milne, &c; but disappointingly the
parodies have little purchase on the style, & if it were not for his use of
alternately indented blocks of verse in the manner of 1960s Prynne the
homage would be unrecognizable.  The verse is often a dense but scattershot
accumulation of nouns, verbs & adjectives:

Dillied zappa ovoid gutters crank's grandeur
titles bury it, but he fashions yosemite,
retires the chariot, mendacity's city century
toked timbreled thirds, missouri synod
noons when the carving's hot for opulent
teutonosis and the vessel vesicatory, olibanum
a chattering verrucano in the vestpocket.

This is neither reminiscent of the Cambridge School (where pronouns,
prepositions & key nouns like "trust," "hope," "love" & "delay" are more
reliable hallmarks), nor is it good writing.  The rest of the book is hit &
miss: "Everybody's too busy trying to resurrect Jack Spicer to read any new
books of poetry" (I liked that one); "The metaphysical impossibility of
imagining / Damien Hirst floating in a tank of formaldehyde."  Stefans in
his reviews often shows an interest in prosody; here the verse runs from
wilfully ungainly poems like "In Case You Were Wondering" to attempts at a
devolved sonnet, a sestina-pantoum cross and something like a relaxed
pentameter/alexandrine line (respectively, "Voici de la prose sur l'
avenir...," "Landscape for Two or Tree" and "Holiday").  Like many books
emerging from the post-Language scene in the States, Angry Penguins is
preoccupied by questions of literary influence, community & succession--a
flip through its pages turns up the names of Prynne, McCaffery, Duncan,
Rimbaud, Spicer, O'Hara, Eliot, Rodefer, Sheppard, Derksen, Ngai, Byron, &c.
Indeed, such preoccupations receive sometimes ostentatious expression: "Fuck
Frank O'Hara!  I love his poetry, but his reputation is destroying us."  But
oddly enough, as the Pellett poems suggest, this book actually might not be
weighed down _enough_ by the example of previous or alternative poetic
practices.  Stefans has shown promise as an author of web-based poetry &
visuals; this book, on the other hand, is extremely disappointing.

Clark Coolidge
Alien Tatters
Atelos Books
$12.95
208 pages
ISBN: 1--891190--08--3

Coolidge's latest collection of long poems -- hot on the heels of his
massive group of loopy lyrics from The Figures, On The Nameways -- takes the
reader to a delicately upsetting space which seems run by the evil twin of
Descarte's god, replacing every object in the room by transgressing all of
the general laws of physics until, like in a swoon, one must fall squarely
into the lush language: "Just kind of a nice frying person. The rest was on
the latch moved over. I could just see a foot or threat of one because my
head was lying on my head. A bit. Then another weighted hand, sort of
spoollike and in spots and dashes. Gaming room with a spread to it." (72)
"Puzzle Faces" is framed like a discovery narrative, an air of mystery being
created by the author's subjunctive sense of meaning and lack of agency as
he/she, in a partly lotus-eater state, tries to avoid panic and indecision:
"There is something heavy being lifted like a blot from the paper. Are you
all prepared? There will be little fun in thin rooms.... Where purest night
is considered a sort of vitamin not just anyone should ingest. I watch the
lights popping out all the way down the cabin. There must be creatures here
who would overlead the populace, just a feeling." (140) However, like the
other four long prose pieces in this book, it soon breaks down into his
idiosyncratic stand-up-parataxis comedy mode, and so rather than follow
though, Beckett-like, on the implications of its shady premises, the work
becomes a play of surfaces on which anything can strike from a number of
angles ("I can't believe the underwear that comes with America"), though
always returning somehow to that discovering voice: "Lower on the block was
half a chicken. There may be people here who roam, but they are not the
semblables. They are mildly warm and senseless. I have to send away and
enclose my vocabulary. I am small and that is my name, 'Small'" (145) As
Coolidge writes in the Afterword, he was very attentive to reportings in the
papers of UFO sightings and alien abductions, and had a "huge desire to
participate somehow. If I couldn't go, then perhaps at least I might learn
to speak the language, and use it to take myself further in, or out, to
what?" (199) The long first poem, "Alien Tatters," takes up this theme most
strongly, seeming to describe what happens among these creatures, though
they never seem to escape his head: "At first there was so much light in the
room with me that I thought it must be the dog. But no. Okay, but I will
explain that the grass was green. They gave me the kind of Jello where it
still came in a set. Then I got launched somehow and let's forget all about
ceilings. When I couldn't see what was below the eyes I always breathed
heavily in short pants. But I'm not even sure about the eyes. I can't even
see the eats." (63) But speaking this language -- as challenging and
seemingly whimsical as trying to learn dolphin mating calls -- seems to have
been Coolidge's desire since his early minimal poems (in "Space" and
"General Electric") through his bee-bop Kerouac prosody (in "Sound as
Thought") and his other long prose works ("Book of During," etc.). That he
decides on a quasi-science fiction theme for his latest book -- though one
thoroughly absent of technological fetishism and/or the humanist reclamation
of weirdness and otherness (cf. Kinsella's The Visitants) -- is not so
unusual given the sheen of philosophical depth that popular culture and
digital technology, not to mention the freakish alienation talk shows grant
to panopticized suburban life, have given the genre. While this book of
Coolidge's may not be for everyone -- it is not as various as the great 70's
"prosoid" works like "Smithsonian Depositions," and one has to really be
able to get over long works with no significant "themes," linear narrative
or apparent correlation with social realities to read it -- it is really
quite buoyant and sonically resonant, skitting skillfully among language and
twisted, paranoiac visions.

ISBN 1--930589--06--9

In his first book of poetry since 1988's Midnight on Your Left, Godfrey --
normally associated with a later incarnation of the New York School, though
he might just as easily be linked to a sort of "post-punk" poetry scene --
shows himself to be one of the most observant and imaginative urban poets
today.  These poems are all in prose, and while the pacing of the writing is
not much different than one would read in fiction -- this is not the
Williams of Kora in Hell or Gertrude Stein, or the ecstatic fables and
apostrophes of Rimbaud's Illuminations -- the sentences combine to create
swirls of meaning rather than stable narrative environments.  "Accede in
Kind" builds sentence by sentence into a troubled, at times darkly erotic
portrait of a woman, known only as "she" throughout.  The drama is in
determining which participant -- the perceived or the perceiver -- should
dominate the spotlight, such that the literary battle of formal perspective
spills over into the content, which could very well be a battle among minor
gods: "I have my hand over that part of her that readies for injury.  It is
stability that suffers solo.  Should she die dreaming of a night passage the
silky weathered sail will have her.  She will be carried along on waves of
heat from roots burning underground.  She is not lacking in hatred; why,
then, isn't she the one to decide the fate of creatures?"  (18)  Like in the
Arcimbolo effect (named after the Italian painter, 1527-1593), in which the
artist utilized different types of fruit to compose his portraits, this sort
of accretion, at its best, is carefully tempered so as to trouble the
relationship of poet to subject; even at the end of this poem, when things
seem to clear up a bit, the subject disappears into maze of unyielding
grammatical hallways: "Ancient dry voices of men come at her and address her
as 'Mother.'  She exhales as deeply as possible and hugs herself in order to
get both the original and the duplicates of her body out the door to the
flatlands, where everything she will need for proof is ready."  Other poems
engage more freely with paratactic sentence structures , a la the "new
sentence," or with classic surreal moments ("The whole hallway is ready to
start rising, like an elevator under leaves," [21]) or with Beat-inspired
word twists that point, simultaneously, at beauty of the sublime sort and
the grounded, earthy resplendence of trash: "Windshield spit allover by
streetside trees breaks out the tunnel into a blinding halo Queens didn't
earn.  By seven-thirty morn, the LIE shines golden white while factories
either side rend their fumes awry."  (46)  A beautiful elegy for the poet
Jim Brodey uses this talking-around-the-subject technique, along with
Godfrey's strong penchant for mating opposing ideas by putting unexpected
conclusions to his sentences, to marvelous effect: "He fancied meat of
dragon swans, as if the gods were always on his lips.  You know how wet they
look from the foam and under ground soak.  I will raise this pitcher to the
skeleton man in case he needs to look up on the light through waters.  A
longing comes over me to tell the abodes of my heart the great nerve sharp
has eloped from exile... Without question he was a being struggling in the
net, drowning in a dry mouth, weakened by exile into blathering purity."
(43)  Poems like "The Big Wingspread" take clear aim at political
demagoguery, especially when it borders on the messianic; other poems, like
"Same Feet," are reminiscent of Jim Carroll in their lighter touch, placing
just the right of surreal weirdness over the interior fires that burn in
love relationships: "Try no matter how many times, I still can't describe
what I feel to see your hair catch fire.  I am fond of your anger and proof
of your pain." (51)  Like with many books of prose poetry, it's not easy to
read Push the Mule all the way through -- sometimes one wishes for more
variety in the meters, more discreteness in the individual poems, more
torquing of the paragraph form, and maybe some wilder sense of humor to make
it a bit less bleak -- but the precision of these sentences, taken one by
one, are often interesting enough and satisfy careful attention.  Godfrey is
never less than noble in the care he takes with his work.

Robert Fitterman
Metropolis 1 - 15
Sun & Moon Press, $11.95, 138 pp.
Winner of the New American Poetry Competition 1997, chosen by Bruce Andrews

Fitterman mates a certain classic "Objectivist" style (in the manner of
George Oppen and Louis Zukofsky) with a hip, contemporary sensibility which
borders on the techno-ambient, thus sacrificing some of the angstier
concerns of his modernist predecessors for an interest in pure, accessible
verbal pleasure.  Metropolis, an on-going work which should reach 24
sections when completed, is very much a New York poem, filled with the
chatter of that city's highly social scene with the everyday weirdness of an
often nomadic life lived deep in the shadows of skyscrapers.  The first
section, despite its cross-cutting collage style, nearly recalls Breton's
Surrealist masterpiece Nadja (itself an homage to a city, Paris) in its
roving eye view and the heady, decentered feeling of its urban
phantasmagoria: "But grander than that / L'Hotel actually happened /
scaffolding in some circles / gone twilight & Lex essences / sipped down
subdeveloper more (bestial, residual, / festive red clay livery / homespun
depot some yellow western atmospheric glib hog / I was there / but there was
no espresso bar / did you _time_ this? the connection / between us is
sheerly residential / minus crossed our paths are starred / in an awkward
upper west side hey-day" (10).  Part of the beauty of Fitterman's style is
that it lets him drop odd, potentially dull stock phrases that one remembers
from somewhere ("we got / a situation here" from the police radio in a
b-movie, or "lighting fixtures the last word in / chrome" from interior
decorator parlance) and puts them in contact with more purely poetic ones
("a lay sky plurals dusk about us," or the last lines of section 1: "the
dead lose / their defenses" followed by the zinger: "that's been my
experience") hence creating a strange floating sensation that elevates the
individual units of the cliche -- the chrome, the situation -- while not
letting the classically poetic moments get precious or sententious.  Section
7 is a sort of fake dictionary utilizing many of the formal devices --
quotes from literature, dates, abbreviations, etymologies -- to create a
difficult but familiar surface in which the humor of not quite knowing what
a word means combines with a quasi-expose on the mystical nature of words
that dictionaries, with their lexical depth psychology, suggest.  Like a
series of brief portraits of the dreamlife of spoonerisms (later in
Metropolis he writes "My favorite opera is Il Trattoria"), section 7 pushes
the limit between poetry and goulash syntax: "Fade -[~]^^^ I. droop,
whither, a company of hunters, any sawed-off weapon that has lost taste to
corrupt, weaken.  1303 _Syn._ neuer gres, ne neuer sall, bot euermore be..
falow, and fade.  2. barber's term, Life began to vade.  3. shrink. Lit. and
_Fig._ OE. _fadian_., Wger. ORG. *_fadia_.  4. v.3. _dial_. to dance around
from town to country.  5. _Spec. Cornish.  A passel of maidens... begin'd
for... to fade so friskis._"  (60)  Section 8 is a "libretto" in which
several landmark buildings -- the World Trade Center, the Flatiron,
Rockefeller Center -- take part in an orderly but disjunctive choral crown:
"FLATIRON: Open up / your heart / and see it / the other way. / What makes /
a hat felt?" (70)  Other sections use odd word breaks ("loo / ming sud / den
a mall / all ang / el & la // ttice at aw / ning's va / se & sparkl / es
pill / ars lewd ac / cusa") to shimmy grammar back and forth in a
flotsam/jetsam manner, and reduced forms like the three word poem ("Life /
long / fishcakes") or other manners of verbal dislocation to create
stucco-like surfaces over which the eye roves for meaning, getting hooked
there and being let loose elsewhere.  It is perhaps useful to compare
Fitterman's technique (which relies very much on arrangement on the page) to
that of an abstract painter, like Robert Ryman or Cy Twombly, who deals with
single colors (in this case, white) over long stretches of canvas to
highlight sculptural surface play; in such works, the "white space" becomes
more than a unit of composition and dominates the terms of engagement, such
that attention is turned to the minor things -- paint flecks, the
chiaroscuro effects of small shadows -- so that the art is both "busy" and
calming, but in any case not making huge, impenetrable philosophical
gestures.  Fitterman's sensual relationship to words -- in both sound and
color -- and his light touch makes reading Metropolis a uniquely satisfying
aesthetic experience.

Newspaper spells it out for rogue writer: you're fired

MediaGuardian.co.uk

Matt Wells, media correspondent

Tuesday January 9, 2001

It must have seemed so clever to conceal a crude rebuke to the Daily
Express's controversial proprietor in his final, florid editorial, but
departing columnist Stephen Pollard must now be wishing that it was all just
a bad dream.

His new employers, the Times, last night confirmed they were sacking Mr
Pollard before he had even started.
George Brock, managing editor of the Times, said: "We have spoken to Stephen
Pollard today and we are not proceeding with his contract to work with us."

The decision was taken by the paper's editor, Peter Stothard, who returned
from a period of sick leave to take back the reins yesterday. Mr Pollard,
who was to join the Times as a leader writer and commentator, was told of
the unfortunate development by telephone.

Mr Pollard's expensive entry in the annals of journalism was made on
Saturday when, in an apparently innocuous commentary on the virtues of
organic farming, he made clear his feelings for the new Express owner,
Richard Desmond. The first letters of each sentence spelled out the message
"fuck you Desmond".

At first, Mr Pollard appeared smug about his prank, joking to Sunday
newspapers that the acrostic was "an amazing coincidence". He must have been
regretting his words yesterday: Perhaps understandably, he was not saying
much.

While some at the Times feel executives have had a "sense of humour
failure", others said Mr Pollard's actions at the Express were inappropriate
for a leader writer on a serious newspaper. One Times executive pointed out
that, while Mr Pollard expressed his frustration at Mr Desmond, there are
many who believe that the News International boss Rupert Murdoch "is the
devil incarnate". Mr Murdoch would not, it was suggested, take kindly to
being insulted in the pages of his own newspaper.

Mr Pollard was among the first of several high-profile departures from the
Express after the takeover by Northern & Shell, publishers of the celebrity
and soft porn titles OK! and Asian Babes.

He was offered a job on the Times as a columnist and leader writer on health
policy issues in early December. Mr Brock confirmed that contracts had been
signed by both the Times and Mr Pollard. It is not clear whether Mr Pollard
will receive a payoff.

Maybe I wasn't as clear as I should have been in my post. It's not the
above quoted section of the review that I found offensive. I'll leave the
state of American poetry up to the Americans. What I found disturbing is
that some one would string together a series of insults with little regard
for critical depth about the poems read that night. If you can read that
review and honestly say that it wasn't written before the reading even
began then I'll shut up. But, if you agree that personal politics,
anymousity and contempt for the evening's participants sharpened the knife
of the reviewer, who must have gizzed his jeans to have all of his hitlist
in one room, then I think that vapidity is not too far off.

Never heard of David Rattray!  Neglected perhaps, but not unknown or
unread.
To say that Rattray was a poet's poet is an understatement.  Trust me,
Joanna, there are other subscribers to this list who have heard of David
Rattray.  Not only heard of him, but hold his work in very high regard
indeed.  Rattray died a couple've years ago and most of his stuff is
probably out-of-print, but to dismiss his How I Became One of the
Invisible as ' that drug book ' is really astonishing.  Read it and
weep.  While How I Became One of the Invisible does include some of
Rattray's takes on ' drugs ', autobiographical and otherwise, it is not
by any stretch of the imagination a ' drug book ' - whatever in the
world that may mean.  It is instead a brilliant collection of
autobiographical essays, critical pieces on other writers who influenced
him, as well as an introduction and possibly even a summation of his
poetics and practice.  It is a poet's book that I would recommend
without hesitation to anyone interested in what it means to be a poet in
the latter half of the twentieth century and into the new millennium.
This little Semiotext(E)
occupies a very special place in my library of poetry/poetics as does
all of Rattray's work, at least the little of it that I have been able
to get my hands on. If you want to ' find out ' about David Rattray,
start with this work. To the best of my knowledge, the only other
readily available selection of his work that's currently available is
Opening the Eyelid, ( diwan, 1990 ). It's a very beautiful selection of
his exquisitely rendered lines. I hope there will be other postings
regarding Rattray and his work on this list. Like yourself, Joanna, I
too would welcome any more information about David Rattray and the
availability of his work.  I really liked your description of the taped
reading from 1985 that you were fortunate enough to have heard and
shared.   Somehow, I can't imagine both Rattray and Wieners reading on
the same bill. David Rattray's work is unlike anything else I have
read.  Indeed, he is one of the ' great secret losses ' to American
poetry of the last century.  That his work is not more well-known is
nothing short of scandalous.

Hi.  Thanks for your reply.  I thought the contention was over that one
specific comment.  I apologize for missing the remainder of carlo's critique
and apologize for any duress produced by my myopia.

as far as "hitlist"s and "gizzed his jeans" matters, i'm not in the business
to read his mind and suggest such strong words for his thoughts.   such as I
am not to suggest I can read anyone else's mind, for to do otherwise would
be dishonest.

it may also be contended that the strong reaction to his critique was
composed well before the actual production of the critique.  that the
reaction was produced after carlo's previous critiques of langpo.  but, as i
said, i'm not in the business of reading minds and do not wish to explore
that speculative avenue.

it seems that the tenor of many of the responses to carlo's comments suggest
that he was in some way trying to be included in some sort of social arena
and that he was rejected by that arena, and it seems people are reminding
others of that rejection.  the use of the word "envy" strongly suggests
that.  now, i think that is not only hurtful, regardless of the veracity of
any such reality, but it also reminds me of the behavior of high school jock
cliques, or university music cliques.  Making gestures of inclusion and
exclusion.  I say that the responses seem to suggest issues of exclusion,
but i expect, as with all matters, only the dark knows the truth.

I would also hasten to add that I do not hold it against an individual to
take poetry personally.  Accepting that some people take matters of poetry
personal should serve both sides of this schism well.

Marla. Sounds as though you'vegot a lot of reading to do! I just started on
Proust. I've read Jean Genet's "The Miracle of the Rose" which "dark" as it
is is actually strangely beautiful in parts. Robbet-Grillet's "Jealousy" is
equally strange as well as "Djinn" and "Labyrinths". Becket's later prose
poems (stories?) are brilliant. So of course is John Ashbery's eg Three
Poems and Flow
Chart, and even Auden in his "Caliban" thing "The Sea and the Mirror". "The
Waves" is haunting like all of Viringia Woolf's works the best of which I
think is "Mrs Dalloway". But Katherine Mansfield was a major influence on
Woolf and arguably is the "greater" writer. Both writers combine "harsh
reality" with beautifully poetic descriptive passages.(Forgive me if I sound
patronising but I dont know what you've read.) I have read "How Late it
Was..." by Kelman. It's good but not what I would consider poetic prose
(however as I said before It Can Be And Has Been Argued That The Dictionary
is a poem). Rather grim and relentless but I mean Kelman not (The Dictionary
who IS a great poet) an antidote to say Annie Proulx
(whose Heartsongs are brilliant). Another "poetic" writer not much mentioned
is Joyce Carol Oates eg of Bellfleur which for me beats Garcia Marquez
hollow. Although I suppose marquez came first. But her short stories are
extraordinary. Cortazar: I found his
"Famos and Cronopias" by accident (translated by Paul Blackburn.then there's
Elizabeth Bishop's prose poem about a scream in a village. Brautigan.
Dostoevsky.
Passages from George Eliot. Lamb, Hazzlitt.Dickens. Swift. Rabellais. Joyce
of course. Stein (esp of "Stanzas in Meditation"). Possibly Burroughs.
Umberto Eco "The Island of the Day Before".
Obviously Mallarme, Baudelaire, Rimbaud etal in Europe and David Jones. W C
Williams of "Kora in Hell" and Creeley in (is it?) "Prescences?"
"Jubilate Agno" by C Smart is incredible. I know some of the others but the
list could go on forever.

And we're back to the question of fiction as poetry and vica versa. (I've
begged that question a bit above.) (Or "What Is Poetry??") I often find that
certain art critics (who may be frustrated or closet poets!) produce some
marvellous writing. I also (so help me X!) actually love reading blurbs!
Some of the best poetry in the whole world's to be found in blurbs (and some
of the worst).  Happy reading, Richard.      Come to think of it "blurb"
might be considered to be an entire poem when set in the kind of semantic
and physical or psychic space that Robert Grenier or David Melnick or maybe
Umberto Eco or....

Gary (And Joanna).  I'm in the "book game" so to speak, so to find books by
D Rattray look up AddAll on a search engine and add it to your favourites.I
use it to price or find obscure books (or common a garden books!). On that
site (probably about 80 million books) (about eight book sites including
Bibliofind Abebooks Alibris and others) there are several edited or written
by David Rattray.About 16. The book dealers know about him but the prices
dont look too bad.Sometimes individual bookdealer attached eg to Bibliofind
know about the writers. You could ask. The books Gary mentioned are there
and some translations. You can buy on line. It looks as though he may have
been an artist or that's someone else. But have a look. Regards Richard.

Dear friends,

We are addressing you from Tbilisi, Georgia, Caucasus. We are NGO - Media
Democratization and Development Association. We are currently trying to help
a
Georgian State Library, but it's rather difficult. As you know Georgia now
is
developing country and unfortunately it has not enough financial sources to
get for us necessary books. Specifically, we are looking for an organization
or an individual who would be able to donate some books in English.
That's why we apply to you with an unusual request to provide us with some
of
your books or even one at no cost if it possible. We sure people would read
and re-read them here many times.
We would appreciate if you could help us and be much obliged.
If we can do something for you will be happy to help.
Please answer in any case.

We are looking forward hearing from you.
 Thousand thanks.

Hello Marla and Others,

I've been wondering if anyone would mention Maso.  She is one of my favorite
writers.  If you're enjoying Aureole I definitely suggest that you also look
at The Art Lover and (though to a slightly lesser extent) Ghost Dance.  It's
her first book and clearly shows the underpinnings of poetics in what could
more easily be read as a straight prose novel.


Hearing Jean Genet mentioned brings up some thoughts-

I'd like to ask if people see a place for the written play within the larger
space of poetic fiction.

The relationship might be the studied economy of language? The relationship
might be the way in which a person is forced to "act" out the part in
his/her head when reading- producing a psychological intensity which makes
language exciting?  Or maybe its just the shear demand on the reader to "do
work" in order to read what is intended for performance?

Not to comment on anything else in these interesting little reviews (much
less on the books themselves), but I found this pronouncement, "nor is it
good writing," quite staggering in its apparent authority to decide what IS
& ISN'T "good writing" without further need to clarify or argue for the
standards by which such determination is made.  Maybe it's because I'm an
American, &/or (thus?) not "weighed down _enough_ by the example of previous
or alternative poetic practices."  Maybe it's because I ENJOYED the lines of
Stephans that you quoted, & found them to BE "good writing" (though I won't
reveal the standard by which I make such judgement!)-- if perhaps also a tad
too reminiscent of Mac Low at his goofiest.  But I wanted to say I found
just this moment in the reviews heavy-handed.  (& By the way, your review
made me want to read the one of these two books I haven't read).

Bye,

described in the vetted version of the speech.  During
her "Jesus year", she published online:  margin notes
from Piers Plowman, an eccentric translation of
Paradiso Canto XXX, bits of Spenser's Amoretti that
insult the woman he married, a documentary poem about
Hong Kong, the opposite of the Book of Thel, and a

Mark--a quick note: I certainly won't be displeased if you decide based on
the extracts I quoted that my judgments of the books in question aren't on
the money & that they're in fact worth investigating: my own preference as a
reviewer has always been to quote as much as possible in the hopes that the
reader can make up his/her own mind.

Yes, I'm aware that the comment on good writing is perhaps culpably
unargued; this was done just for reasons of space, really (the Doris, BKS &
Davis reviews appeared as quickies in the mag under the group title "Caught,
Tagged, Released"): a detailed critique seemed to me unnecessary given that
I'd quoted the passage & the reader could judge for him/herself as to the
justice of the claim.  To sketch out a more detailed comment I'd simply note
that the writing seems to me very different from Mac Low's, as the
wilfulness everywhere inscribed on the surface--the jamming together of as
recherche lexical items as the author can think of, with little care for
syntactic spacing or the cross-eddies of signification & illumination that
might make them worth pausing over--is rather the opposite from Mac Low's
enormous sensitivity to words, _all_ kinds of words (& to syntax): take a
look for instance at the series of sentences produced from anagrams towards
the end of _Representative Works_ (I forget the title at the moment), or at
the _Twenties_, &c.

That sentence about the weight of previous authors is too cryptic or
indirect I'm afraid: I'd meant that namechecking one's favourite authors
isn't the same thing as demonstrating a grasp of what makes their work tick
or the ability to assimilate the lessons of such influence into one's
writing.

all best --N

As I recall, you complained about my attempt to address the very sort of
mentality and POLITICAL CORRECTNESS that tries to undo FREEDOM OF SPEECH as
protected in the US Bill of Rights.

NOW, it seems that you are seeing into the IDIOCY of the RadLiberals inane
attempt to undermine the rights of others in their spurious bullying to
foist an impossible ideal of justice that leads to greater injustices (The
Red Guard of China fame.) for all writers other than themselves.

The danger they pose is through their willing use of Government to force the
rest of us to obey their idealisms.  These people are politicians who jump
into art for purposes of ideology.

Hi Gary,

Oh I'm happy you brought up Schuyler because as I read _Opening the Eyelid_ now I've been thinking about what it has in common with Schuyler. (I think there's a lot-- the obvious is that they both seem to take line breaks really seriously-- their poems are full of unnerving enjambments)  Also they both seem to have a total faith in the mind's ability to associate. They move quickly from the concrete to the abstract in ways that don't quite make sense and there's a weird humor to these leaps.  In one of my favorite S. passages he writes (from the poem "Good Morning" in _The Morning of the Poem_.)

"...The night
 nurse means well, is
something else jabbering
loudly in the hall
at night. An over-
ripe banana. I
have yet to learn
to speak my rage."

Rattray writes in "First Human" from _Opening the Eyelid_

"...One day, before he ever had a pipe or drank
Smoke, First Human mixed some kinniknnick
Which he ate, then slept and dreamt
The berries turned to blood running out his armpits.
Stopped them up with grass
And that was the beginning of armpit hair.
The limos of the rich
Kept easing by.
And to think some woman asked if I
Come from an old family...."

The humor's similar-- a soft dark sort. In "Good M." the humor comes from S. noticing a banana peel in his moment of stress. In "First H.". it comes from the pun on the idea of being "old." "Old money" versus "being one of the original humans who stepped from the void." In both passages, the poets start observing some kind of primal horror and then make a joke in its midst.


best,

Joanna


. Like how I feel when I read Schuyler's The
> Crystal Lithium," which is actually very similar. (The feeling I get
> reading it; if not necessarily the work, though actually kind of,
> yeah, except Schuyler's more chatty or something and Rattray more
> bookish?) This sense of someone distant from their body, like a husk

Some people talk to squirrels and OffWorlders all the time,
Who drop in for dinner and talk and laugh.
Families visit each other between the worlds, animal, human, ET.
You have to be quite a saint to participate and also very smart.

None of these good times with friends obviates the reality
that at any moment some tom cat, or BlackOP cop, or even some bitch
who always has to get a sharp word in edgewise, can laser cannon
a beamship runabout, strike a nerve, or kill a civilizing squirrel.

I don't know if you people got this message and made it to the opening or
not... but I<trishy> went to one of the workshops this afternoon (I=20
<trishy>was too sick to
make any yesterday - or even go out! UGH!) and made my VERY FIRST BOOK
today. So rad.

they are doing several bookbinding workshops, a letterpress workshop, and a
bunch of cool presentations all during the month of january at space 1026.
They're all free, but they're also trying to raise funds to go on a
full-length tour of USA and Canada (schools, arts centers, prisons,
community centers, etc.) showing books and giving workshops. They hope to
get a grant but if they can't get one (or the funds are not enough) then
any little bit will help. Anyway -spread the word, and come out to an event
if you can and are interested. The girls doing the project are super nice
and really helpful too.

I hope to make a couple more workshops. Yay!

Dear Secret Cinema listee,

While there haven't been any SC screenings in a few weeks, rest assured
that we are busily planning events for 2001 at this very moment.

Meanwhile, here is the latest schedule of great free screenings from our
friends at the Chestnut Hill library. While they seem to have borrowed our
"never ever video" tagline, we wish more "repertory film venues" would
share this philosophy. The Chestnut Hill Film Group shows real film prints
of interesting stuff on a nice big screen. The number of organizations
doing this in Philadelphia can easily be counted on one hand. See you there!

debuted at Number 1 in 32 countries and has achieved sales in excess of 6
million worldwide since its release on October 31, 2000. The debut track
Beautiful Day has just received three Grammy nominations including "Song
of the Year," "Record of the Year" and "Best Rock Performance by a Duo or
a Group."

"U2 Elevation Tour 2001" is the band's first tour since the highly
successful "Pop Mart," the top-grossing tour of 1997, playing to over 3.9
million people in 70 cities worldwide.

The tour will begin in North America visiting 34 cities from March through
June 2001. The stage for the "U2 Elevation Tour 2001" has been designed to
provide a full view to every seat in the arena. The band will then follow
with a European tour in the summer of 2001 with dates in The Netherlands,
Sweden, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Spain, France, Denmark,
Ireland and England. Additional details on U2's European tour will be
announced in the coming months.

"We are very excited to be promoting 'U2's Elevation Tour 2001,'" said
Arthur Fogel, President of Touring, SFX Music Group. "The anticipation to
see U2 in an arena is tremendous and we along with the fans, look forward
to it."

U2 will offer General Admission floor tickets giving fans the best view in
the house for $45 per ticket. With nearly half of the seats in the arena
priced at $45, additional tickets will also be available at $85 with a very
limited number of golden-circle seating at $130. As the band's manager Paul
McGuinness explains: "We haven't played arenas since 1992. With no seats on
the floor, these shows are going to be very exciting. The fans and the band
are going to be really close. Nearly half the house will be at the lower
ticket price and some of those tickets, the ones on the floor, will be the
very best in the house."

First day sales for tickets purchased at the box office will not be subject
to service fees. Ticket purchases will be limited to two (2) tickets per
person for "Best of the House" general admission tickets on the floor and
four (4) reserved seat tickets. Tickets for North America will go on sale
beginning January 13, 2001.

MTV and VH1 will be the media sponsors for "U2 Elevation Tour 2001" in
association with Best Buy in North America. SFX, the world's largest
promoter, producer and presenter of live entertainment, will promote the
tour while veteran worldwide concert producers RZO Productions will serve
as tour producer. For further tour information visit www.sfx.com or for

About "How I Became One of the Invisible", au contraire, it is suffused
with the perfume of intoxication.  Ok, calling it a drug book is just a
start, but how else to start with this odd, exuberant, sober, yea,
cheerful book.  I, too, highly recommend this book of, let's call them
essays, but please oh please not poet's prose.  It took me quite a while
to grow into this book, so I feel like someone who wants to crow about it,
I, too, became one of the invisible.  What brought me to it was a line in
_I Love Dick_ about David Rattray.  Not much of a line, as it turns out,
but something clicked and then I saw it at Open Books here in Seattle and
thought, hmm, why are they selling a _Semiotexte_ book (i.e., theory,
politics and so cool that if you swing a dead cat at it, it immediately
freezes and cracks) in an all-poetry bookstore.  So I of course  got it.
And then the slow reading began, since Mr. Rattray's prose is far from
showy.  It's simply there and so there you can easily miss it.  Same for
the persona, voice, etc.  I went looking for scandal and what I found was
detached but friendly presence overseeing a remarkably disparate set of
essays--memoirs of road trips, coming of age pieces, divagations on
translation and the very odd essay at the end about "How I Became One of
the Invisible."  At first it seemed like a hodge-podge and I had problems
reconciling or compiling how they all went together.

But they do, though I'm not going to spend time trying to say why I think
so.  All I will say is that initially I was taken with the
autobiographical stuff--it had what I was looking for, the drugs, the
sexual ambiguity, the (for lack of a better word) documentation of
transgression.  After their charm wore off, however, I found myself then
taken with the pieces about Artaud, particularly Artaud's cane and the
bizarre linguistic/symbolic play that it engendered.  My initial reaction
to the "HIBOOTI" essay was sheer bafflement.  How could this presence, who
seemed anything but priestly, then write such a monkish piece?  I couldn't
understand it and put the book aside for a good six months.  But upon
returning and then really reading the Artaud piece, rereading the
autobiographical pieces, and then finally the last essay, I found myself
completely taken.  I understood it--or not understood, wrong word, sorry,
rather I felt I had come to grips with it, maybe had come to grips with my
own longings for askesis--except I don't think that is what the piece is
about.  I still don't know.

And now having seen the posts about Rattray's associative leaping, I see
perhaps the cause of my initial befuddlement.  So, I'll be looking for the
poetry.

"I want to be free. This is the most basic truth I can write you. What do
I mean? That I want to be free of this Net, that I want to release all the
words and articles and images and video and web pages I've written or
collaborated in, that I want to release them forever onto the wires, that
I want to do other things, let them slowly disappear, I went from 2110 to
2080 sites on google.com (under "Alan Sondheim" not under the Myouka or
Jen stuff, see how I boast, sickeningly, even now, half-collapsed); I want
to let the words become part of the bone and marrow of the Net, my name
effaced, everything gone. I want this freedom desperately; yet I am bound
by furious clamps on my brain; I can't escape; I can't get away; I type
and type into the night; it's my compulsion; it's my obsession, my
addiction. I want to let the words float like seeds, like sails, like
wings, like birds, like albatross, do they ever land on land, do they fly
forever? I want to fly, I want to die, knowing the words are burrowed deep
in magazines; this is the century only proceeding the next. Listen to me;
I'm talking from the dead; I'm already dead."

"Don't you know the third millennium's already half over, the fourth is
breathing down our throats? Listen to me, I'm speaking from the past -
please help me; I'm speaking from the past."

"I want to see the fourth millennium, the third's tiring, the second al-
ready gone and dead, dead, dead; I want to see the fifth; I'll write and
write, preserve my words for thousands of years; if you read this in the
future, recite them, let others hear them: these are the words of a dead
man still yearning to be free. Please bring me! Please bring me back! I
want to see you! I want to see your face!"

Your point should be inscribed at this point?  I consider the following
again, your ... Would give you a graphological mechanism? Incision paints
me beneath your point! How would you define your freedom?

My wings, like birds, like albatross, do they ever land on land, do they
fly, do you understand my language...

I want to be free. This is the most basic truth I can write you. What I do
calls forth streamed imperative, hungered, making things. Beneath the
falls, I want to be free. This is the most basic truth I can write you.
What do I is mountains, ... imperative is mean? That I want to be free of
this Net, that I want to release all on black stone, it's imperative.
Please try and understand this. I can't help it that my words are getting
lost. I'm sitting here, crying; my mouth is filled with nonsense. Please
try and understand this; I'm sitting here crying.

Are you satisfied with wanting to be free. This is the most basic truth I
can write you. What do I? Wait! I want to be free. This is the most basic
truth I can write you. What do I and 29990 are written down and you don't
understand me and I want you to so understand. Please please try. I don't
have time left, I'm already dead, I need you, I need you.

For 4 days, we have been streams and written and it has taken you 0.167
minutes to write your last -

I want to be free. This is the most basic truth I can write you. What do I
forever? I want to die, return, the known words are burrowed deep, words
and articles and images and video and web pages I've written - Write
wings, streams, like birds, like albatross, do they ever land on land, do
they fly through my freedom. This is the most basic truth I can write you.
What do I want! God help me! Bring me back to life!

Jesse,
I had a look at your site and was interested in buying at least one book but
you, or whoever, didn't include the postage price!  Could you back channel
me and let me know. Great metaphors, from what I can see.
Thanks

Renee Gladman's new book out by Kelsey St. called _Juice_

Has four sections.  The following comes from "No Through Street"

""Looking" is an activity moving on the conviction that there is more to
seeing that sight; my sister introduced the possibility to me.  There was a
wooden fence surrounding our house that creaked through the night.  She
wanted me to look at it.  The night was mild, so I wasn't worried about the
cold.  The sky was clear.  If there had been anything she needed to show me
in the sky, that night I would have been able to see it.  But my sister said
looking had nothing to do with the sky."

dubya, dubya, dubya...

Come and listen to my story 'bout a boy name Bush.
His IQ was zero and his head was up his tush.
He drank a litle moonshine while he drove his car about.
But that didn't matter 'cuz his daddy bailed him out.
DUI, that is.  Criminal record.  Cover-up.
> >
Well, the first thing you know little Georgie goes to Yale.
He can't spell his name but they never let him fail.
He spends all his time hangin' out with student folk.
And that's when he learns how to snort a line of coke.
Blow, that is.  White gold.  Nose candy.
> >
The next thing you know there's a war in Vietnam.
The kin folks say, "Georgie, why not stay at home with Mom.
Let the common people get themselves all maimed and scarred.
We'll buy you a spot in the Texas Air Guard.
Cushy, that is.  Country clubs.  More nose candy.
> >
Well, twenty years later George W  gets a little bored.
So he trades in the booze an claims Jesus is his Lord.
Says "Now Washington's White House is the place I wanna be."
So he calls up his daddy's friends and they called the GOP.
Gun owners, that is.  Falwell.  98 year oldJesse Helms.
> >
Then come November 7, the election ran quite late.
His kin folk said to Jeb his brother “Give the boy your state!
Don't let those colored folk down there get themselves into the polls."
Hav police act like a barricade and make sure ladies can’t  punch their
holes.
Chads, that is.  Duval County.  Miami-Dade.
> >
Before votes could get were counted right wing Justices stepped in.
Told all the voters "Hey, we want George to win."
"Stop counting votes!" they hollored as their solemn invocation.

for me, genet is the bomb, as they say, one of my big intros to literature.
whenever i see reference to this particular book, miracle of the rose, i
remember trying to tell some kid about it when i was in high school, i said
there was this character called Harcamone, to which the kid replied,
"You're kidding, a character called 'Aw, c'mon'?!"

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994.
A `round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery by Brad
Brace. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
stellar, trajective alignment past the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative
metaphors for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of events...

A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual
impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless
present of the Net.

An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and
re-sequenced over time... ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The
12hr dialtone...

                  [ see  ftp.idiom.com/users/bbrace/netcom/books ]

KEYWORDS: >> Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous,
reckless... >> Multi-faceted, oblique, obsessive, obscure, obdurate...
>> Promulgated, personal, permeable, prolonged, polymorphous,
provocative, poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic,
pathological... >> Evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,
entertaining, entropic, erotic, entrancing, enduring...

Every 12 hours, another!...  view them, re-post `em, save `em, trade
`em, print `em, even publish them...

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest
on December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs  has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years`
worth of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the
ongoing publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each
12-hour posting is like the turning of a page; providing ample time
for reflection, interruption, and assimilation.

~ The sites listed above also contain information on other
transcultural projects and sources.

~ A very low-volume, moderated mailing list for announcements and
occasional commentary related to this project has been established at
topica.com /subscribe 12hr-isbn-jpeg

This project has not received government art-subsidies. Some
opportunities still exist for financially assisting the publication of
editions of large (36x48") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet
quadtones bound as an oversize book. Other supporters receive rare
copies of the first three web-offset printed ISBN-Books.

Your assignment, Mr. Dillon, is to write us an essay on how Tibet today is
worse or better off than it was before the Chinese invasion.  Describe the
oppression of the Buddhist monks and the monarchy in the feudal Tibetan
system previous to Chinese occupation versus the oppressive measures of the
communist Chinese.  Explain how that change in Sino-Tibetan relations
translates to the Clinton presidency, and whether either the Bush family or
the Chinese were involved in the Mena operation.  Explain how the democratic
system could possibly be greased.  And whether the Chinese grease our
elections, and hence run the Mena operations.  Explain whether the John
Birch organization is secretly run by either the Chinese Government or the
Buddhist monks now residing in Nepal.  And the explain the relation of the
formation of Communist governments to large scale investments from wealthy
Western families that finance both the Democratic and Republican parties.
If you believe Vladimir Lenin or Joseph Stalin had sexual relations with
Averell Harriman, please supply photographs, and explain this relationship
in relation to various members of the Rockefeller family, and to the current
state of affairs in Tibet.  Also, please explain whether you believe oral
sex is either communist or capitalist, and therefore whether Hillary Clinton
is truly capitalist or communist, based on your prior hallucinations of oral
sex.  Further, explain how oral sex has conspired to overtake all world
governments (e.g., the UN Head Services Committee) into a One World System.
Please make sure to include references, except in the cases where extreme
paranoia makes you feel as if someone's life is at risk.  Points will be
taken off for incorrect spelling and bad style.  Points will be awarded for
brevity and coherence.

As I recall, you complained about my attempt to address the very sort of

protected in the US Bill of Rights.

NOW, it seems that you are seeing into the IDIOCY of the RadLiberals inane
attempt to undermine the rights of others in their spurious bullying to
foist an impossible ideal of justice that leads to greater injustices (The
Red Guard of China fame.) for all writers other than themselves.

The danger they pose is through their willing use of Government to force the
rest of us to obey their idealisms.  These people are politicians who jump

Patrick. I think your previous email made good sense. The critique made was
admittedly superficial by Carlo & his friends but it divides into
parts.
1. The quality of the actual readers' delivery or presentation of their
work.
 In this case its hard to see that all the poets would be dull or "bad". Of
course there's no connection (neccessarily) between the quality of a reading
or the way a poem is delivered and the ability of the poet or the quality of
his/her poem.

2. It was a general attack on the poetics hence politics etc of those
reading. I say general because it (Parcelli's post) implies that everyone
reading were of or
in a similar poetic "direction" or mode or whatever.

3. Its not a useful thing in itself but I didnt read the whole thing either
and misconstrued it somewhat.  Regardless of that I was informed by C
Parcelli etal that they and quite a  number of others have been removed from
the list. In looking at the emails that took place around the time (around
1998 to 1999) there was certainly some "disagreements" but the manner of
those involved seemed (if sometimes a bit emotive) generally ok to me.
Clearly they are now "on the attack" against the Langpos. They're not alone
in that. Also they seem to be very passionate on the political implications
of  poetics etc but not all the posts were political.

4. While a post saying effectively "This is all crap..." is neither much use
nor very informative, its point lies in its passion.It maybe "sour grapes"
but then...so what? As you implied, it could
be preferable to "backslapping".

5. Questions arise as  to who and why who was and have been banned from
expressing their views. After all the reading could have been very bad. And
to many people Langpo is both meaningless and betrays their view of what
poetry should be. To others its "done its dash" and is promoted by a sort of
petis-hierarchy...as in the debate via Lingua Franca etc.
This is not neccessarily my view, but those who run Flaspoint obviously have
strong views on this and feel they have been taken off this List
unjustifiably.

6. Somebody compared it to a "rude" person at a party whom one removes from
the room. But this is a big room and we're adults. Literature's "greats"
would probably include many you'd want to get "out of the room"...but does
that mean excluding them forever? Would it include E Pound of "The Fascist
Cantos"? In which Pound is gleeful about a trap in which some Canadian
soldiers were lead to their deaths? (But ironically C Parcelli etal seem to
be big Pound fans...perhaps of the "other" Pounds. Dylan Thomas for his bad
example re his use of the sacred ichor?  Who else? Helen Vendler and Harold
Bloom? You? Me?

So there are a lot of questions arising from this "attack".  Some truth in
the implied criticism of Langpo "selling out". But unfortunately C.
Parcelli's post was a bit limited. It kind of shot itself in its own foot.
Still if one is going to be run over and you think you're a big shot you'd
better be run over by a tank or a cadillac moving with a bit of con brio
than a rusty little con largo mini!
 As to rejections...we could have a competition on this list for the most
interesting (insulting,meaningless,vapid,frightening...etc) rejection set as
a ratio of the frequency of rejections. A RejectPo Ratio maybe. Regards,
Richard.

Hi there. I think what Schuyler does is to move rapidly in his thoughts and
observations both inward and ouutward-
but they are mostly his thoughts (or are very cleverly designed to seem so)
so that in one poem he's got a couple of books in front of him and I think
he's lying in in bed and he says
something like "Oh, where was I - oh that's right" and his attention goes to
a picture in the book or he looks out the window and comments on somethng
he's reminded of by what he sees. He is also very economical and quite
subtly tender in dealing
with love: he imagines the leaves outside to be his lover's hands. He's less
prolix than say James Merrill who (brilliant as he is) gets (too?) complex
which
is not like Ashbery or say (obviously a very different writer)Bruce Andrews
who is full on so to speak and
Ashbery you can (more or less) "just read". Bruce Andrews is brilliantly
funny but its never HIM,or its him at a greater remove, nor can you ever get
a lot of other poets pinned and
wriggling or they become (sometimes necessarily) over dramatic as with some
so-called "confessional" writers.Wieners seems rather sad in his "love"
poems...but maybe that's how he wants(wanted) to speak.  But Schuyler is
less dramatic or whatever and bears careful reading. Of course that applies
to all writers but some are easier to overlook
   His work is also brilliantly well crafted...deceptively so. Perhaps some
poets are overcrafted but crafted suits Schuyler. Must get hold of something
by Rattray.Thoughts of an Old Brain. Regards, Richard.

both seem to have a total faith in the mind's ability to associate. They

NO.  It is a poem, like a Dorn, that damns everyone and praises them also.
I shared it with you, but intended no personal attack.  I mean you've got
Goneril (sic) in there, I admit, but you also have Darth Vader.  I sent it
to quite a few brilliant people.  I am surprised that things went akilter
here with you.  Oddly, other people thought I had cribbed Dorn, so you may
appreciate the wild misreadings given the intention I had.  It really is an
evocation in honor of Dorn's "Abhorrences" -  If you can take yourself out
of this, and I think you will, and just look at Dorn and at what I intended,
you will have to admit I did a pretty good job in memorializing that
irascible sensibility.  I knew him pretty well but we were never friends, by
the way.

Dear Poetics List (Richard Andrea Rachel Maria and
anyone following this thread about Fiction as Poetry)

     Andrea, I too love Maso. I mentioned AVA in my
first listing. Until starting Aureole that was the
only book of her I had read. I think AVA is fantastic!
But yes I will take up your suggestions and look into
those other two titles.
     Something about your drama question below.

     Rachel, thanks for the recommendation.

     Richard, yes, a lot of reading! Or not. This list
I posted was more faithful compiling than personal
wish list or new year's resolution. I think i
mentioned that were a few things on it that I know
already that I don't much care for (Burroughs for
instance).

     And now for the other questions.
     Yes, Richard you did beg the question in your
list of suggestions; STANZAS in meditation, after all.
I didn't find myself very inclined to try and answer
the question somehow. It's certainly safe to assume
that poetry has lines and rhymes and fiction comes in
a novel, but also silly and limiting. Carole Maso's
AVA pushes more tender poetry buttons for me than
Stein's Tender Buttons does (and yes I realize how
herectical that opinion might be here). I would
imagine, though I can't think of any examples off
hand, that there is a lot of writing which in a
library or a book store would be classified as essay,
philosophy, erotica, devotional, science, art, women's
studies or even history that would push my poetry
buttons just as much.
     Andrea, your question about plays fitting into
the "the larger space of poetic fiction" leaves me
stumped. You suggest that "the relationship might be
the studied economy of language" but to me it seems
that often novels don't have to be economical, they
can just as easily be excessive in detail or
description and be great partially because of that.
Your suggestion about the reader needing to act out
the parts is interesting, though I don't know whether
I do that any more with a play than I do reading a
novel. I do find reading plays more difficult somehow,
probably because I'm lazy and get tired of reading
names and after awhile I'm confused about who is
speaking. All that is not very enlightening I know.
Why though, are you interested in fitting plays into
"the larger space of poetic fiction"?

Sincerely,
M

RETRIAL OF JORDANIAN POET ORDERED

HAWAMADEH ACCUSED OF APOSTASY

Amman (AFP)
A Jordanian Islamic appeals court yesterday [4 December 2000] ordered the
retrial of poet Mussa Hawamdeh on charges of apostasy after he was cleared
of any wrongdoing earlier this year [2000] by a first instance court.
     "The Islamic appeals court of Amman informed me today, Monday, that it
refuses to ratify the verdict of acquittal issued in July by the Islamic
first instance court," Hawamdeh told AFP.
     He said the new trial reopened yesterday in the first instance court of
Amman.
     That same court in July acquitted Hawamdeh of charges of apostasy -
turning away from religion in an anthology entitled *My Trees Are Taller*.
     Jordan's Islamic appeals court, in a statement obtained by AFP, said
the acquittal did not take into account the opinion of experts to determine
if Hawamdeh's poem effectively distorts the words of the Holy Quran.
     Hawamdeh, who describes himself as a devout Muslim, has staunchly
defended himself against any wrongdoing.
     Hawamdeh, whose book has since been banned by the government, defended
himself in court as a believing Muslim.
     "I was not trying to distort the version of the Holy Quran in the poem
but, as a poet, I have the right to draw on historic symbols to criticise a
current situation," he said in July.
     If found guilty of apostasy Hawamdeh could be forced by the court to
divorce his wife.

If you've read Wittgenstein, you've read G.E.M. Anscombe,

Ron

January 13, 2001

G. E. M. Anscombe, British Philosopher, Dies at 81

By SARAH BOXER

G. E. M. Anscombe, a British moral and analytic philosopher as well as one
of Wittgenstein's literary executors, died on Jan. 5 in Cambridge, England.
She was 81 and had chronic heart disease, said her husband, Peter Geach.

Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe - known by her initials or as
Elizabeth - was a dry, fresh and formidable thinker, one of the foremost
philosophers of mind, language, ethics and action. She fused Wittgenstein's
philosophy of language and Aristotle's philosophy of ethics, framing an
original theory of action.

Her work was tightly linked with Wittgenstein's. She was Wittgenstein's
student and friend during World War II.

In 1951, when Wittgenstein died, Miss Anscombe, along with Wittgenstein's
two other executors, Rush Rhees and G.H. von Wright, began the task of
getting his work into print. ("Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus," which came
out in 1921, was Wittgenstein's only book published in his lifetime.)

Miss Anscombe translated Wittgenstein's "Philosophical Investigations" from
German into English, and had it published in 1953. Her translation of his
work called "Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics" came out in 1956.
With Mr. von Wright, she assembled little bits of Wittgenstein's writings
that had been cut up and stuffed in a box, and published them under the
title "Zettel" ("Snippets") in 1967.

Miss Anscombe and Mr. von Wright also put together "Notebooks, 1914-1916."
Editions of Wittgenstein's "On Certainty," "Remarks on Colour" and "Remarks
on the Philosophy of Psychology" followed.

In 1959, Miss Anscombe wrote "An Introduction to Wittgenstein's "Tractatus,"
which traced his work to Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. The book is
viewed as a classic by philosophers.

A. J. Ayer, in his book "Wittgenstein," wrote, "I can think of no one but
Elizabeth Anscombe who has made an original contribution to philosophy on
the basis of Wittgenstein's teaching." In 1980, Miss Anscombe even inherited
Wittgenstein's former position, the chair of philosophy at Cambridge
University.

Wittgenstein was not her sole influence. She also wrote about Plato. And in
the field of ethics, Miss Anscombe looked especially to Aristotle. Like
Aristotle, she believed that ethics must be tied to the idea of what it
means to flourish as a human being. Mr. Geach, her husband and sometime
collaborator, a professor of philosophy at the University of Birmingham and
University of Leeds, put it this way: "She thought that a theory of ethics
without a theory of mind was bound to be bogus."

In 1957 she wrote "Intention," a blend of Aristotle's and Wittgenstein's
philosophy, linking ethical ideas and behavior to a theory of intention and
action. The philosopher Donald Davidson recently called the work "the most
important treatment of action since Aristotle." Her husband said that may
have been an overstatement.

The next year she wrote an influential essay on morality, "Modern Moral
Philosophy," which was later published in her three-volume "Collected
Philosophical Papers" (1981). In that essay, as Cora Diamond, a professor at
the University of Virginia, explained, Miss Anscombe argued that the
concepts of moral obligation and moral beauty were legalistic and should be
abandoned. Right and wrong actions, Miss Anscombe said, cannot be determined
by their consequences but rather are absolutes. She recommended Aristotle's
concept of virtue instead.

In 1940, Miss Anscombe converted to Catholicism, and many of her writings
reflected her moral and religious stance. In a 1939 pamphlet, "The Justice
of the Present War Examined," she had argued that Britain was entering an
unjust war.

In "Mr. Truman's Degree," she fought Oxford's decision to give an honorary
degree to Harry S. Truman, accusing him of murdering innocents in the
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

She condemned contraception in a pamphlet called "Contraception and
Chastity" (1975), saying "you might as well accept any sexual goings-on, if
you accept contraceptive intercourse."

In 1957, in an anti-Cartesian paper called "The First Person," she said that
"I" does not refer to anything. And in 1985 she resurrected St. Anselm's
900-year-old argument for the existence of God.

G. E. M. Anscombe was born March 18, 1919, the daughter of Allen Wells
Anscombe and Gertrude Elizabeth Thomas Anscombe. One of her two brothers was
killed in the war. His twin, Thomas, survives Miss Anscombe. She was
educated at Sydenham School and St. Hugh's College, Oxford.

At Newnham College, Cambridge, she was a research student from 1941 to 1944.
That was where she first met Wittgenstein. She taught at Somerville College,
Oxford, from 1946 to 1970. From 1970 to 1986, she was a professor of
philosophy at Cambridge. She became a fellow of the British Academy in 1967
and an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Miss Anscombe and her husband were a well-known philosophical duo. They met
while studying Catholic doctrine at Blackfriars College, Oxford. They were
married in 1941 and had seven children, all of whom survive her: three sons
(John, Charles and More) and four daughters (Barbara, Mary, Jennifer and
Tamsin). Miss Anscombe and Mr. Geach also produced a book together, "Three
Philosophers"; he wrote on Aquinas and Frege, she on Aristotle.

Miss Anscombe, who did not like to be called Mrs. Geach, smoked cigars, wore
trousers when they were considered improper for women and was said sometimes
to eat beans from a tin can while lecturing.

Her philosophy was bold and noncomplacent too. In the Times Literary
Supplement, the critic Mary Tiles wrote, "Anscombe's willingness to question
what many have taken for granted . . . can induce a feeling of intellectual
disorientation."

Aldon, there are already many well-organized groups planning anti-W
events, like the black unity rally I saw flyers for, women's groups, you
name it, but I think there is as yet no public urination squad to pee on
the parade. I feel that men should take the lead on this for obvious
reasons. Mark Wallace? You wanna coordinate?

In 1955, after an evening of piano works by Cage and Stockhausen generated

much anger and scoffing at Wesleyan, RK Winslow, a professor of music at the

school, wrote a letter to the campus paper, the Argus, suggesting, as

follows:

"Those who were antagonized by the performance and who have run out of

descriptive terms for it, can find a variety of fresh insults in a book

called Lexicon of Musical Invective by Nicolas Slonimsky (Olin Library), a

compilation of on-the-scene reactions to the music of, e.g., Beethoven,

Bach, Mozart, Verdi, etc."


The argument here seems to be that some work is, in a sense, 'ahead of it's

time.'  The work's 'goodness' or 'quality' is always present -- just not

always realized when first presented.  The idea of a 'transcendent' quality

disturbs me.  I cannot argue, of course, against the phenomena described.

For example, I really enjoy Beethoven's "Grosse Fugue", which contemporaries

found "confused," "chaotic," even "abhorrent."


P.S.  I don't want to denigrate Mr. Silliman's larger point that personal

attacks are unwarranted and unhelpful; his post merely got me thinking.  And

I certainly don't mean to overly criticize Mr. Sondheim's work posted on the

Poetics List, some of which I find very powerful (such as "Water-shedding,"

"Up-to-date kings in meadows," "Women, Spartans, and Dangerous Things,"

"Dead in the w., "Nikuko tells the truth," and especially "cut out from the

archives:").

 >>

This is interesting.  I don't think I'm completely up to date on this
discussion, so allow me to apologize in advance if I should misrepresent.
Having said that, what tickles me is the notion that future listeners,
readers, et al will see value in a work whose contemporaries cannot see,
ostensibly because the contemporary culture has not yet provided the proper
hermeneutic/analytic tools.  If this is true (and history suggests it very
well might be), then isn't it possible that anything we do, no matter how
flippant/annoying/ill-conceived it appears today, might tomorrow attach
itself to great value.  If so, then what's the point of adhering to any
standards whatsoever except, of course, those guidances proscribed by
contemporary culture for appreciation in a contemporary world (if that's what
we seek).  If posterity is a goal, and since we cannot know how future
intellectuals will understand their world, we are free to write/paint/compose
anything, any piece of shit (as judged by contemporary sensibilities) with at
least some rational hope that it may one day be appreciated as a work of
genius.  Is it possible that the artist who plans her innovation, whose work
is "considered," and the "artist" who merely takes a dump on a canvas, have
an equal shot at the canon?  And what does all this mean for our concept of
talent?  Is talent at all relevant?  Did Beethoven have talent?  More than
his contemporaries?  Did Mozart?  Whose word are we taking for this?  And
why?  Can we ever be assured that the future is wiser than the past?  Whew!
Sorry for all the questions.

We should also consider, I think, that it is rarely, if ever, a matter of
wiser intellectuals seeing what previously could not be seen.  Rather, isn't
it a matter of the RIGHT people lending their support to one text or another?
 We know that a measure of political slip/slide is always operative.  And
these days, when only poets and other "experts" read poetry (since the
average reader is pretty well alienated from serious art), it may be nothing
but politics.

I agree with Ron that personal attacks get us nowhere.  But were they
personal attacks?  Or simply one dude's judgments, however harsh, of the
quality of the work (some of which I enjoy, by the way)?  Such judgments,
whether pro or con,  are probably meaningless unless they issue from someone
with clout, whether or not that person lives among us or wanders some future
intellectual geography.  If anyone's interested in a really bizarre example
of an old text ramming head on a contemporary sensibility, check out my
review of Zukofsky's A Test Of Poetry in the January/ February issue of The
American Book Review.  I doubt Zukofsky could have foreseen my
"deconstructive" avenue of appreciation.  But I could be wrong.  Best, Bill

FEATURING

===Couch Potato Poetics by Dale Smith===

(excerpt) "But it's the poet's task to recognize and address the specific
forms embodied in cultural phenomena. To simply dismiss complex psychic
manifestations without acknowledging the possibility--even the recurring
patterns--of their existence is to betray his or her role. Poets are
outsiders looking in, reading topologies as well as what lies beneath them.
Poets in our economy have no function. They are instead responsible to the
guiding lights of their individual psyches, intellects and senses, and to
the restoration and renewal of the world through them. Against those vital
applications of attention Bernstein proposes to limit a poets' potential by
a self-censure that molds poets of acceptable social functionality."

==Poet's House by Linh Dinh==

(excerpt) "Chanh is the poet maudit of Saigon. A decade ago, he made a small
fortune dealing in lumber. He then published two volumes of poetry. The
second one, Night Of The Rising Sun, is particularly noteworthy for its
intense, hallucinatory language. When he wrote that book, Chanh said, he was
staying indoors almost continuously. Inside his darkened room, he would
scrawl pornographic images on the walls with a pencil. Now unemployed, Chanh
spends his time reading, writing and translating. He is working on a version
of T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land."

 I thank Richard for elucidating the point that I have been trying to make
since the original review appeared on this list. His note, which I only
excerpted here in a spirit of brevity, is more succinct than anything I
ever could
have written. I'll go quietly now into the cold Canadian night.

Don't forget "that rascal" John Neal--the closest approximation American

19th century Gothic thunderclaps.  I admire him immensely.  Bentham did too!

Did anyone mention Joseph McElroy in this connection? (I don't have the list that was posted with me.)  Always among the most "poetic" of prose wroters, but there's a publishing curiosity in this regard.  The first hardback edition of his monumental novel WOMEN AND MEN (or is it MEN AND WOMEN?) on the acknowledgements page says that several of these "poems"  had first appeared in journals -- Since there is no verse in the book, this seems to mean that the prose sections are thought of as poems.  Does anybody have a copy of the Dalkey Archive reprint?  I'd be curious to see if the acknowledgement still reads that way.

For that matter, Peter Taylor used to write his narratives out in the form of free verse poems in the intial draft, then turn them into prose paragraphs in revision.  I don't know of anybody else who works that way.

It is inappropriate to do this over your web site.
You would not do this for those in support of Ashcroft.
You don't seem to understand why you are being inconsistent here.

The wording of your post is disingenuous.  It is as if you are saying, "It
is okay for me to forward the message, I am simply doing a favor and not
engaging in lobbying myself."

How would you handle this if your were to meet my ethical standards?
Either permit me to forward similar requests from organizations in support
of Ashcroft, or simply present a debate between the two sides by means of
essays or poetry or direct ripostes, or stop such one sided activism
altogether.

What you appear at this point to be is an adjunct of the extremists in the
Liberal wing of the Democrat Party.

Once again:  Is experimental literature and poetry under the tutelage,
protection and ideological bent of Sociocratic Liberalism and no other
political philosophy operating in the State of New York?

Subject:      About these Fiction as Poetry suggestions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Poetics,

     Well, I've been busy reading some of the
suggestions from this list of "fiction as poetry". I
read Wittgenstein's Mistress (Markson) and Aureole
(Maso), In The Labyrinth (Robbe-Grillet)and V.
(Pynchon), The Rings of Saturn (Sebald) and have
started Proust. Yet, if anything, I'm more confused
than before about the idea of "Fiction as Poetry."
This has been a grand success in terms of giving me
suggestions for good novels I might not have known
otherwise (thanks you to all), but putting my finger
on the poetry in these works has been difficult.
     The Pynchon, though I did enjoy it (it made me
shudder too, at the descriptions of Esther's nose job
and the atrocities in Africa), never really felt like
poetry to me very much. Possibly because there were so
many song lyrics and 'poems' inserted into the text,
which amusing as some were, seemed so very small scale
in comparison with the rest of the book. Or it may
simply be that, unusual as the book is in many ways,
the things that are striking about it all seems so
"novelistic"--the shifts in time, the ways characters
are developed, appear and reappear. Of course poetry
can do all those things, but, for the most part
doesn't, unless we wish to go back in time a ways.
     Aureole I thought was pretty good, if not as
stunning as Maso's earlier novel AVA. In that book the
poetry fiction essay memoir question is always
hovering and hard to pin down. A few times I felt
myself wishing that it would settle into one mode or
another as the interplay wasn't exciting me as much at
that moment. I think it is also interesting that Maso
seems to feel that she wasn't ready to write poetry or
to write so poetically earlier, seeming to imply that
AVA and her other earlier work was fiction plain and
simple. I disagree.
     In The Labyrinth was sort of odd. I knew the name
Robbe-Grillet but didn't know anything about him. In
this book it seems to me that the most poetic elements
or effects or whatever were those that seemed to
frustrate the linear presumptions of most narrative,
that it was those odd repetitions and partial
repetitions that made the work feel poetic to me. But
one can imagine a poem that is very much linear and
narrative, so I don't trust that this observation
helps much.
     Then with Markson and so far with Proust there is
a certain weird similarity. As much as the two novels
don't seem very much alike at all, they both have that
very interior feeling. Proust's doing this while still
moving all over and involving many characters and
Markson's by it's solitary, last-woman-on-earth
narration. Both of these books seem to me to blend
into poetry (maybe not so much as Maso's AVA does for
me at least) but in different ways. Wittgenstein's
Mistress pushes my poetry buttons by the repetition of
certain ideas and phrases, by how it moves from
observation to reflection to recollection to assertion
to doubt and round about that in a different order.
Swanns Way feels like poetry because of it's
interiority, it's long, almost endlessly elaborating
ruminations, the firm sense that Proust's
consciousness is between us and any actions it
describes.
     Maybe it would make a refreshing change if we
just called all of it "writing." Or maybe it would
just confuse people more.
     Finally I wanted to end with a quote from W.G.
Sebald's The Rings of Saturn (which maybe also reminds
me of Proust and Wittgenstein's Mistress a bit but
which is so outwardly focused, on landscape on history
on much else besides --- it is haunting though and
that is what feels poetic about for me right now, that
parts of it are lingering in my head) where poetry is
briefly touched on;

     "When I arrived in Manchester, he had already
begun practicing his writing skills with brush and pen
and would spend many hours in deep concentration
drawing one character after another on immense sheets
of paper. I recall now how he once said to me that one
of the chief difficulties of writing consisted in
thinking, with the tip of the pen, solely of the word
to be written, whilst banishing from one's mind the
reality of what one intends to describe. I remember
also that when he made this observation, which applies
to poets as well as to pupils in primary school..."
p.186.

Sincerely,
Marla

POETRY PLASTIQUE February 9-March 10, 2001
Marianne Boesky Gallery, NYC

Curated by Jay Sanders and Charles Bernstein

*Note: special catalog price for Poetics List subscribers.

PRESS RELEASE:
"Poetry Plastique" presents the work of 34 poets and artists working to move
poetry off the page and into sculpture, film, painting, assemblage,
photography-even skywriting. Pushing the boundaries of textuality, these
literary and visual artists move poetry into a new dimension that emphasizes
the concreteness and materiality of the written word. Featuring both
collaborations between poets and artists and well as visual work by poets
and textual work by visual artists, "Poetry Plastique" presents some of the
most significant poets and artists of the time in a context that promises to
change our understanding of poetry and its relation to visual art.
"Poetry Plastique" includes new work as well as an historical section of
works from the 1960s to 1980s that provides a context for understanding the
developments charted by the show. Extending from the work of visual poetry
and book art, the poem-objects in "Poetry Plastique" suggest a markedly
different approach to language than is often seen. Indeed, while language is
a common element in much contemporary visual art, the works in "Poetry
Plastique" use language not as a conceptual screen or a set of received
ideas but as an active principle for articulation and meaning.
"Poetry Plastique" is a verbal explosion in the art factory. It returns
cutting-edge poetry to the center of art culture, a position poetry occupied
for much of the last century. It is a celebration of the physical dimensions
of the written word and the textual dimensions of art objects.
"Poetry Plastique" is curated by Jay Sanders and Charles Bernstein and
includes works by Carl Andre, David Antin, Arakawa, Susan Bee, Wallace
Berman, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge and Kiki Smith, Christian Bök, John Cage,
Clark Coolidge and Philip Guston, Robert Creeley and Cletus Johnson, Johanna
Drucker and Brad Freeman, Hollis Frampton, Madeline Gins and Arakawa,
Kenneth Goldsmith, Robert Grenier, Lyn Hejinian, Lyn Hejinian and Emilie
Clark, Tan Lin, Jackson Mac Low, Steve McCaffery, Emily McVarish, Tom
Phillips, Nick Piombino, Leslie Scalapino, Mira Schor, Robert Smithson,
Michael Snow, Richard Tuttle and Charles Bernstein, and Darren
Wershler-Henry.

A fully illustrated catalog, including statements from most of the artists
and introductory essays by Sanders and Bernstein, is forthcoming from
Granary Books in association with Marianne Boesky Gallery. *WE ARE OFFERING
A DISCOUNT FROM THE $20 COVER PRICE TO POETICS LIST MEMBERS. SEND A CHECK

Saturday, February 10th at 12pm at the gallery, there will be a symposium on
"Poetry Plastique," moderated by Marjorie Perloff. Most of the poets and
artists in the show will participate. At 6pm on the same day, there will be
a film showing followed by a poetry reading by "Poetry Plastique"
participants.

Gwyn/Aldon, in the sixties we used to call the gatherings "be ins," so I
suggest "pee in" for this revival. I won't be able to get to Washington,

Han Shan (110, Pines) and Nikuko


Look at him there. You can stick him with a pin. His eyes are turned
inward. You can stick him with a pin.
  Look at her there. She hasn't moved for hours. She just sits and sits.
  You can almost hear her breathing.
Look at them there. They're not do anything at all. You know they're
showing off.
  He thinks he's dharma-perfect. He thinks his hands are perfect. He
  thinks his legs are perfect. He sits straight and perfect.
She sits straight and perfect. She thinks her robe is perfect. You can
stick her with a pin.
  You can stick them with a pin. They're so dumb they don't know anything.
  They're so stiff they're really dumb.
Look at the things over there. You can stick them with a pin. They won't
move at all. You can't pull them over. They're really dumb.

dear list---

several phrases keep buzzing my mind like pesky little deja-vus.
I'd appreciate it if anyone can point me to sources for them.

*pursued into eternity by "the pursuit of happiness" *

*dear Jack. he never found it*   [referring to Kerouac]

*rain no rain. birds no birds*

*you've strangled my words, I'm all craven inside*

Subject:      Creeley on Corso
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Date: Thu, 18 Jan 2001 17:59:20 -0500
From: Robert Creeley
Subject: Gregory Corso

Gregory Corso died last night (January 17), happily in his sleep in Minnesota.  He had been ill for much of the past year but had recovered from time to time, saying that he'd got to the classic river but lacked the coin for Charon to carry him over.  So he just dipped his toes in the water.

In this time his daughter Sherry, a nurse, had been a godsend to him, securing him, steadying the ambiance, just minding the store with great love and clarity.  He thought she should get Nurse of the Year recognition at the very least.

There's no simple generalization to make of Gregory's life or poetry.  There are all too many ways to displace the extraordinary presence and authority he was fact of.  Last time we talked, he made the useful point that only a poet could say he or she was a poet -- only they knew.  Whereas a philosopher, for instance, needed some other to say that that was what he or she was -- un(e) philosophe! -- poets themselves had to recognize and initiate their own condition.

There are several quick websites that help recall him now.  One gives a brief biography and discussion of a few of his poems:

http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/a_f/corso/corso.htm

Another, more usefully affectionate, is taken from Ed Sanders' The Woodstock Journal.  It was Lawrence Ferlinghetti who had suggested last summer that a spate of respects might help cheer Gregory in his illness -- and that they were certainly well merited:

http://www.woodstockjournal.com/corso.html

A third, which includes some previously noted, is The Museum of American Poetics.  There's a 'streamable' video available there of Gregory reading at Naropa , if you can get the sound clearly:

http://www.poetspath.com/corso.html

Lots of us propose to be poets but who finally stakes all, or just takes all, as being that way?   In my life time only Robert Duncan could be his equal in this way.  It was honor indeed to have had his company.

RC, Buffalo, January 18, 2001

***

The Whole Mess ... Almost

I ran up six flights of stairs
to my small furnished room
opened the window
and began throwing out
those things most important in life

First to go, Truth, squealing like a fink:
"Don't!  I'll tell awful things about you!"
"Oh yeah?  Well, I've nothing to hide ... OUT!"
Then went God, glowering & whimpering in amazement:
"It's not my fault!  I'm not the cause of it all!" "OUT!"
Then Love, cooing bribes:  "You'll never know impotency!
All the girls on Vogue covers, all yours!"
I pushed her fat ass out and screamed:
"You always end up a bummer!"
I picked up Faith Hope Charity
all three clinging together:
"Without us you'll surely die!"
"With you I'm going nuts!  Goodbye!"

Then Beauty ... ah, Beauty --
As I led her to the window
I told her:  "You I loved best in life
... but you're a killer; Beauty kills!"
Not really meaning to drop her
I immediately ran downstairs
getting there just in time to catch her
"You saved me!" she cried
I put her down and told her: "Move on."

Went back up those six flights
went to the money
there was no money to throw out.
The only thing left in the room was Death
hiding beneath the kitchen sink:
"I'm not real!" It cried
"I'm just a rumor spread by life ..."
Laughing I threw it out, kitchen sink and all
and suddenly realized Humor
was all that was left --
All I could do with Humor was to say:
"Out the window with the window!"

Marla. I think you have somehow missed the point of the whole exercise. Lets
put it tis way: firsly you need or we need to have a working defiion of
poetry, which prima facie seems as difficult and possibly as fruitless as
defining art...you can go for Aristotle's absolutes or get into
Wittgenstein's endless chain or rope that although linked has in its parts
no actual connections. This doesnt rule out the possiblity of widening one's
view and gaining indights into art,but a clear definition eludes. Some of us
( I know that sounds very snobby) know or know that "It can be shown...."
that a complete performance of . what?, Wagner's  "Ring Cycle" can be seen
in a certain way of interpretation as a gigantic poem (hence the suggestion
re a play in some circumstances being a poem), James Joyce eventually
advised people to read Finnegan's Wake as an enormous poem (in fact hearing
him in an old recording by chance it sounds like a poem), or to be more
extreme, it can be shown and you must be able to agree with me that the
Webster's or The Shorter Oxford or any other    dictionary, in fact any text
or composite of texts or in fact ANYTHING can be, can be, seen to be a poem.
I have a friend of a friend who compiled a table of odd numbers with a
certain value of exponential (yet stepping) increment: he printed these out
and the sheets of number were a or was int its totaliy: a wonderful poem:
greater than Shakespear's rather overrated and sentimental sonnets and
"weepy" plays. However, as I pointed out to him, he gave the book a title,
which wekened it somewhat. I borrowed a phrase from a local textualiser to
the effect that it was "too laid back modernist". This comment,
unfortuanately had the effect of this individual, tearing off the title page
to his vast and exciting number-filled tome. This was taking things too far,
but the point is there...
 So you must see from these comments that ANYTHING.....ANYTHING (I  repeat)
can be a poem. Otherwise you buy into a sort of pseudo-sentimental bourgeios
concept of "correctness" and "classifiablity" or curse my soul "certainty".
i am certain that George Bowering, while not agreeing with me totally (as I
havent mention Jakobson yet) would, at least in some wise, concur in this.
But I am amazed. You must be able to read very quickly. (as to old J J's
Finn Wake  I'd advise caution as people die trying to elucidate that
gargantuan and tortuous  text. In fact when I showed it to my son who
dosednt read much trying to impress him with the fact that it took 17 years
to write, his comment was, quite appositely: "He took so long to write that!
Bu it's nonsense. Children write nonsense." And indeed, I couldnt contradict
him. I have it somewhere in my mass of unread books..where I have no doubt
it shall remain...)
  I am a rather slow reader.  Which fact partly explains my fascination with
blurbs, which I think are a neglected art form (no doubt there is someone at
Yale or Harvard or even Peking University struggling at this very now with a
tremendous thesis on The Blurb (which has obvious
semtico-polioco-Marxist-and Derridean links via Sassurre etc to the word
"Blob" (a beauti ful, nay even erotic, word or mot)(note how I fragmented
that last word)("Blob" I mean) adn even to "blurt"?)
 But to get back: "The Crying of Lot 49" is the book to read...anyway,stet:
as i said, anything can be seen, in  fact can be shown to be, poetry.  Even
my masterpiece "The Red" is a poem.
 Yours faithfully,Richard.

Beat Poet Gregory Corso Dies at 70
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Filed at 6:41 p.m. ET
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Poet Gregory Corso, one of the circle of Beat poets that
included Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, has died. He was 70.
Corso, who had prostate cancer, died Wednesday, his daughter, Sheri
Langerman, said Thursday. He had been living with her since September, she
said.
Born in New York's Greenwich Village, Corso was the author or co-author of
more than 20 collections of poetry and other works. Ginsberg discovered
Corso in the 1950s. Corso's first poems were published in 1955.
One of his best-known works was the 1958 poem ``Bomb,'' an ode to atomic
weapons in the shape of a mushroom cloud. ``Know that the earth will madonna
the Bomb/ that in the hearts of men to come more bombs will be born/
magisterial bombs wrapped in ermine,'' he wrote.
Among his collections of poems are ``Gasoline,'' ``Elegiac Feelings
American'' and ``Mindfield.''
He remained active up until his death, recording a CD with Marianne
Faithfull at his daughter's home, Langerman said.
Corso was born March 26, 1930, to teen-age parents who separated a year
after his birth. His own biographical notes in a compilation called ``The
New American Poetry'' give a sample of his style and the early hardship of
his life:
``Born by young Italian parents, father 17 mother 16, born in New York City
Greenwich Village 190 Bleecker, mother year after me left not-too-bright
father and went back to Italy, thus I entered life of orphanage and four
foster parents and at 11 father remarried and took me back but all was wrong
because two years later I ran away and caught sent away again and sent away
to boys home for two years and let out and went back home and ran away again
and sent to Bellevue for observation ...''
At age 17, Corso went to prison for three years on a theft charge. After his
release in 1950, he worked as a laborer in New York City, a newspaper
reporter in Los Angeles, and a sailor on a boat to Africa and South America.
It was in New York City that he first met Ginsberg, who introduced him to
contemporary, experimental work.
Maria Damon, an English professor at the University of Minnesota who has
taught Beat literature, spent a week studying under Corso at the Naropa
Institute in Boulder, Colo., in 1977. While Corso was lesser known than
Ginsberg and Kerouac, he deserves no less recognition, she said.
``I would say that he was very gifted, also undisciplined, which is part of
the beauty of Beat writing,'' she said. ``He was very well-read but not from
formal schooling. He put things together in a highly romanticized way.''
Michael Skau, author of a 1999 book on Corso, said Corso was a media
favorite when the Beat movement exploded in the 1950s because he was ``the
prototype of a bad boy.''
``He was very disruptive whether it was a social setting or a literary
setting, very antagonistic even toward his closest friends,'' Skau said.
``Ginsberg tolerated behavior from Corso that made Ginsberg look like a
saint.''
Corso was married three times. Survivors include five children, seven
grandchildren and one great-grandchild, Langerman said.
Funeral arrangements were not final, but a service was planned in Greenwich
Village, with burial in Rome, Langerman said.

Dear John.  This information is wonderful. I've just glossed thru it and
I've immediately become converted to the idea - or the plan as a writer (or
nonwriter) - of adopting such strategies of sending preemtive abusive
letters to my potential publishers (but nothing harmful) and maybe the most
brilliant method (probably with the posthumous blessing of such as .... well
such as value silence) of not actually writing anything. Which strategy is
probably the safest. It is economical of time and  guarantees one is, well,
never rejected. And we dont even need a "Rejection Competition"! Not even
the agony of not winning "The Rejection Competition". Oh, calooh, callay!
Anyway, what wonderful people these are to create rejection recovery centres
etc
  Life is wonderful when nothing ever happens. So peaceful, cool, juicy, and
beautifully inane.So tempting; so shadenfreude. Oh golly! I  am immensely
immensely gratified to you. Its good to know that, despite everything,and
despite that we inhabite this pernicious and pain-filled spinning  muckball
that (thank X), is very soon due for annihilation, probably by a cometic
collision or overheating or heat death or an especially and juicily evil
variant of the bubonic plague, or the CIA, or a Thermonuclear War,or
spinning off into the beckettian blackness, or the blakean or sartean void,
there's hope. Hope and a sort of beautiful resignation: a wonderfully
clichaic sense of non-event. A sort of banging whimper, or to rephrase that,
a banging whimper.(How silly of me I meant a "whimpering bang"!) And.  "the
ending snarl"  I believe was Ed Dorn's phrase. Something to look foreward to
like a meal of roaches. Something simple yet profound like a "passionate
dawn" (Alexander F. Pope). Ah, hope! Hope! Hope of a kind, a rather shining
and sanguine vapidity that quickens me. Please, please accept (you cant
possibly reject)  my enormous thankfulness.I am yours,eternally gratefully
and ever so humbly yours... etc R.T.

Gregory Corso, a Candid-Voiced Beat Poet, Dies at 70
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/19/national/19CORS.html

January 19, 2001

By WILLIAM H. HONAN

Gregory Corso, a poet and leading member of the Beat literary
movement that shook American social and political life in the late
1950's and 60's, died on Wednesday in Robbinsdale, Minn., where he
lived with his daughter Sheri Langerman. He was 70.

 The cause was prostate cancer, Ms. Langerman said.

 To the
literary world, Mr. Corso was considered less political than Allen
Ginsberg, less charismatic than Jack Kerouac, but more shocking, at
times, than either of them. In his book, "The Beat Generation"
(Scribner, 1971), Bruce Cook calls Mr. Corso "the most avid nose-
thumber of them all," a man regarded as a nemesis by those who
detested his "hip, easy, wiseguy manner and direct artless
diction."

 A put-on specialist at poetry readings, Mr. Corso would delight
his fans and inflame his critics by muttering into a microphone
disconnected thoughts like "fried shoes," "all life is a Rotary
Club" and "I write for the eye of God."

 But he could also be a serious social critic, re-examining an
institution like marriage, said Ann Douglas, a professor of
American studies at Columbia University. The lines of his poem
"Marriage," for example, are wry and optimistic. The poet begins by
asking playfully, "Should I get married? Should I be good?" and
concludes constructively: "Ah, yet well I know that were a woman
possible as I am possible then marriage would be possible."

 Mr. Corso's early work helped pave the way for the feminists of a
later generation, Professor Douglas said. "Women looked at Corso
and the other Beats," she said, "and asked, `If these men can free
themselves from constricted gender roles   getting married, working
for a corporation and so on   why can't we?' "

 Mr. Corso's finest poem, most critics agree, is "Elegiac Feelings
American," which is an elegy for his friend Kerouac and for dead
notions of America and a new hope:

 O and yet when it's asked of you `What happened to him?'

 I say,
"What happened to America has happened

 to him   the two were inseparable" Like the wind

 to the sky is
the voice to the word. . . .

 Like other Beat poets, Mr. Corso's work was less elegantly
stylized than that of his predecessors, and closer to ordinary
feelings. It was personal and candid in the expression of intimate
feelings   sexual desire, despair and things that would not have
surfaced in an earlier time.

 While Ginsberg and Kerouac came from upper-middle-class
backgrounds and got to know each other through Columbia University,
Mr. Corso's upbringing was troubled.

 Gregory Nunzio Corso was born on March 26, 1930, in New York, the
son of teenage parents who parted when he was a year old. He
bounced in and out of foster homes and jails and never made it to
high school. At 12 he was caught selling stolen merchandise and
sent to prison for several months while awaiting trial.

 His fellow inmates were "terribly abusive," he wrote years later
in an autobiographical sketch. When acquitted, he spent three
months under observation in Bellevue Hospital.

 When Mr. Corso was 16 he returned to jail to serve a three-year
sentence for theft. It was then that he read the classics
Dostoevsky, Stendhal, Shelley and Christopher Marlowe among others
but also became, as he expressed it, "educated in the ways of men
at their worst and at their best."

 He once told an interviewer for Contemporary Authors: "Sometimes
hell is a good place   if it proves to one that because it exists,
so must its opposite, heaven, exist. And what was heaven? Poetry."

 Mr. Corso was released from prison in 1950. Soon after, at a bar
in Greenwich Village, he encountered Ginsberg. Mr. Corso was then
writing fairly conventional verse, and it was Ginsberg who
introduced him to long Whitmanesque lines and surreal word
combinations.

 At this time in his life, Mr. Corso was traveling the country,
working as a laborer, as a reporter for The Los Angeles Examiner
and as a merchant seaman.

 In 1954 he settled briefly in Cambridge, Mass., where he virtually
took up residence at the Harvard University library, poring over
the great works of poetry. His first published poems appeared in
the Harvard Advocate, and his play, "In This Hung-Up Age," a
macabre drama about how a group of tourists are trampled to death
by a herd of buffalo, was performed the next year by Harvard
students.

 His later poetry exhibited an eclectic vocabulary. Referring to
his study of the dictionary, Mr. Corso told the critic Michael
Andre that he "got that whole book in me, all the obsolete and
archaic words. And through that I knew that I was in love with
language and vocabulary, because the words and the way they looked
to me, the way they sounded, and what they meant, how they were
defined and all that, I tried to revive them, and I did."

 Mr. Corso moved to San Francisco in 1956, too late to attend
Ginsberg's famous reading of "Howl" but in time to be recognized as
a major Beat poets. In an introduction to Mr. Corso's early
collection "Gasoline" (City Lights, 1958), Ginsberg called him "a
great word-swinger, first naked sign of a poet, a scientific master
of mad mouthfuls of language."

 Later, with Ginsberg, the two poets wrote a manifesto, "The
Literary Revolution in America," in which they announced their
convention- bashing "discontent, their demands, their hope, their
final wondrous unimaginable dream."

 While Mr. Corso was never as politically involved as some of the
other Beats, in 1965 he was dismissed from a teaching position at
the State University of New York at Buffalo because he refused to
sign an affidavit certifying that he was not a member of the
Communist Party.

 In recent years, Mr. Corso continued to write, teach and lecture.
He published 13 books of poetry, two books of plays and several
collaborations.

 Mr. Corso's first marriage, to Sally November, ended in divorce.


In addition to Ms. Langerman of Minneapolis, he is survived by his
second wife, Belle Carpenter of Santa Fe, N.M.; two other
daughters, Miranda Schubert of Manhattan and Cybelle Carpenter of
Minneapolis; two sons, Max Corso of Guam and Nile Corso of Hamden,
Conn.; his mother, Margaret Davita of Trenton; a brother, Joe Corso
of Long Island; seven grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.

 Mr. Corso often played the wayward child among his friends. The
novelist Herbert Gold recalled sitting with him and other Beat
writers in a Paris cafe when Mr. Corso impulsively snatched the
check, exclaiming, "I never paid a check before!" Ginsberg, Mr.
Gold said, "took the check from him and gave it to me with a
reproachful glance at Gregory. It was assumed that Gregory would
never be able to pay a check."

(apologies for cross-posting)


Internet Philosophy and Psychology -                           Jan/Feb 01


This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net, and sent in the form of texts to various lists. The URL is:
http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/ which is partially mirrored at
http://lists.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html. (The first
site includes some graphics, dhtml, The Case of the Real, etc.)

The changing nature of the email lists, Cybermind and Wryting, to which
the texts are sent individually, hides the full body of the work; readers
may not be aware of the continuity among them. The writing may appear
fragmented, created piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent whole. On my
end, the whole is evident, the texts extended into the lists, partial or
transitional objects.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as total-
ity, restrain its diaphanous existence. Below is an updated introduction.

-----

The "Internet Text" currently constitutes around 100 files, or 4500 print-
ed pages. It began in 1994, and has continued as an extended meditation on
cyberspace, expanding into 'wild theory' and literatures.

Almost all of the text is in the form of short- or long-waves. The former
are the individual sections, written in a variety of styles, at times
referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are interrelated; on
occasion emanations are used, avatars of philosophical or psychological
import. These also create and problematize narrative substructures within
the work as a whole. Such are Julu, Alan, Jennifer, and Nikuko, in parti-
cular.

The long-waves are fuzzy thematics bearing on such issues as death, sex,
virtual embodiment, the "granularity of the real," physical reality, com-
puter languages, and protocols. The waves weave throughout the text; the
resulting splits and convergences owe something to phenomenology, program-
ming, deconstruction, linguistics, prehistory, etc., as well as to the
domains of online worlds in relation to everyday realities.

Overall, I'm concerned with virtual-real subjectivity and its manifesta-
tions, relative to philosophical concerns. I continue working on a cdrom
of the last seven years of my work (Archive); I also have additional
video materials, created with Azure Carter and Foofwa d'Imobilite, on two
cdroms, Baal and Parables. Most recently, I've been working on a text for
publication in a month or two, ".echo" - as well as "cancer.txt" which
deals with loss, mourning, and death. And I've finished articles on Stel-
arc and Panamarenko. I want to write once again on radio and radiations.

I have used MUDS, MOOS, talkers, perl, d/html, qbasic, linux, emacs, Cu-
SeeMe, etc., my work tending towards embodied writing, texts which act and
engage beyond traditional reading practices. Some of these emerge out of
performative language soft-tech such as computer programs which _do_
things; some emerge out of interferences with these programs, or conversa-
tions using internet applications that are activated one way or another.
And some of the work stems from collaboration, particularly video, sound,
and flash pieces.

There is no binarism in the texts, no series of definitive statements.
Virtuality is considered beyond the text- and web-scapes prevalent now.
The various issues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real VR are
already in embryonic existence, permitting the theorizing of present and
future sites, "spaces," nodes, and modalities of body/speech/community.

It may be difficult to enter the texts for the first time. The Case of the
Real is a sustained work and possible introduction. It is also helpful to
read the first file, Net1.txt, and/or to look at the latest files (lq, lr)
as well. Skip around. The Index works only for the earlier files; you can
look up topics and then do a search on the file listed.

The texts may be distributed in any medium; please credit me. I would ap-
preciate in return any comments you may have.

Current cdroms are available for $14; if you've have an earlier version,
they go for $10. Baal and Parables are ach $15 (video format is .mov with
Sorenson compression). (Costs include shipping.)

You can find my collaborative projects at
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/index.htm and my conference
activities at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk - both as a result of my virtual
writer-in-residence with the Trace online writing community.

As much as an activist as I like to think of myself (though hardly a
liberal Democrat despite what Mr. Dillon seems to think), I must urge
caution, Sylvester.  Many urban areas have enacted particulalry strong laws
prohibiting outdoor relief in recent years, aimed squarley at the
soon-to-be-growing-again homeless populations of our cities.  You may want
to find out what the penalty might be in Maine before your protest.  Then,
like Thoreau's friends, the rest of us can pony up your fine and spring you
from the hoosegow after you've had a night to meditate and write a classic.

presents

writer Jackson Mac Low

Saturday, January 27, 7pm, Dinnerware Gallery, 135 East Congress
Admission: $5; Students $3

Jackson Mac Low is an internationally-acclaimed poet, composer, and writer
of performance pieces, essays, plays, and radio works, as well as a painter
and multimedia performance artist.  Author of twenty-six books, Mac Low was
recently awarded the prestigious Tanning Prize of the Academy of American
Poets; among many other awards he has also received a Guggenheim and an NEA.
Among his recent books are 42 Merzgedichte in Memoriam Kurt Schwitters
(1994) and Barnesbook (1995).  Reading co-sponsored by Chax Press.


In addition to his Saturday evening reading for POG and Chax, Jackson Mac
Low will also offer a two hour workshop on Sunday:

Making Poetry “Otherwise”: a Workshop with Jackson Mac Low
Sunday, January 28, 1-3, St. Philip’s in the Foothills (Vestry Room)
(NE corner of River and Campbell)
there is no charge to attend this workshop

Jackson  Mac Low is widely known for his experimental compositional methods.
His work makes various use of what he calls “deterministic procedures,”
often mixed with other writing modes to produce “liminal” works suggestive
of the threshold between the Unconscious and Consciousness.  This workshop
will offer participants the chance both to talk about such procedures—as
well as other ways of writing poems “otherwise”—and to try some out through
a variety of activities.

Workshop co-sponsored by The University of Arizona Extended University
Writing Works Center, The University of Arizona Poetry Center, The
University of Arizona English Department, and the journal Arizona Quarterly.

the beat goes on....

on Monday, January 29--one day after Jackson Mac Low's workshop--POG and
Chax present

poet Hank Lazer

For the past twenty years, Hank Lazer has published poetry in many of
America's leading literary magazines and journals of experimental writing.
In 1992, he published Doublespace: Poems 1971-1989 (New York: Segue), a 192
page collection of poems written in several deliberately conflicting
styles. This book, which has received considerable attention, is unique in
American poetry and enacts essential conflicts within current American
literary culture. Also in 1992, Lazer published INTER(IR)RUPTIONS
(Generator Press), a series of ten collage-poems which incorporates a wide
range of layouts and materials, from baseball batting averages to critical
theory, from fashion and interior design columns to research in
neurophysiology. In 1994, Ink A! Press published a fine press limited
edition (including an audio cassette) of Negation, a series of ten poems.
Three of Ten, published in 1996 (Chax Press) is Lazer's largest collection
of poetry since Doublespace.

In May 1993, Lazer, along with poets Charles Bernstein and James Sherry,
published Language Poems (Sichuan Literature & Art Publishing House), a
bilingual (Chinese English) collection of poems, along with several essays
on contemporary American experimental poetry. In conjunction with the
publication of this book, Lazer travelled to China and gave readings,
lectures, and discussions in Chengdu, Beijing, Nanjing, and Suzhou as part
of a cultural exchange with Chinese poets, scholars, editors, and students.

In addition to his poetry, Lazer is a noted critic of modern and
contemporary poetry. For the past three decades, his writing on poetry has
appeared in leading literary journals. In 1996, Northwestern University
Press published Opposing Poetries, a two-volume collection of Lazer's
essays on the poetics and cultural politics of recent innovative American
poetries. He has also edited two influential books of criticism.

Lazer received an A.B degree in English from Stanford University and
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in English from the University of Virginia. A
Professor of English at the University of Alabama where he has taught since
1977, Lazer is Assistant Dean for Humanities and Fine Arts.

REMINDER

POG

presents

writer Jackson Mac Low

Saturday, January 27, 7pm, Dinnerware Gallery, 135 East Congress
Admission: $5; Students $3

Jackson Mac Low is an internationally-acclaimed poet, composer, and writer
of performance pieces, essays, plays, and radio works, as well as a painter
and multimedia performance artist.  Author of twenty-six books, Mac Low was
recently awarded the prestigious Tanning Prize of the Academy of American
Poets; among many other awards he has also received a Guggenheim and an NEA.
Among his recent books are 42 Merzgedichte in Memoriam Kurt Schwitters
(1994) and Barnesbook (1995).  Reading co-sponsored by Chax Press.


In addition to his Saturday evening reading for POG and Chax, Jackson Mac
Low will also offer a two hour workshop on Sunday:

Making Poetry “Otherwise”: a Workshop with Jackson Mac Low
Sunday, January 28, 1-3, St. Philip’s in the Foothills (Vestry Room)
(NE corner of River and Campbell)
there is no charge to attend this workshop

Jackson  Mac Low is widely known for his experimental compositional methods.
His work makes various use of what he calls “deterministic procedures,”
often mixed with other writing modes to produce “liminal” works suggestive
of the threshold between the Unconscious and Consciousness.  This workshop
will offer participants the chance both to talk about such procedures—as
well as other ways of writing poems “otherwise”—and to try some out through
a variety of activities.

Workshop co-sponsored by The University of Arizona Extended University
Writing Works Center, The University of Arizona Poetry Center, The
University of Arizona English Department, and the journal Arizona Quarterly.

If you're planning to attend the Jan 28 workshop with Jackson Mac Low,
you're invited to send POG a brief sample of your writing which we'll pass
on to him soon.

you can definitely attend the workshop even if you don't submit work, but
Jackson indicates he'd find it useful to have samples from several of the
participants (everyone, by the way, "gets in" the workshop: the sample isn't
a screening device, but a way for Jackson to have a better idea of the
writers he's working with).

(the other side of the coin: you should only send work if you're reasonably
sure you'll attend the workshop).

since time is short, you should send work via email:

please send as an ATTACHED FILE if possible, since this will preserve your
formatting (if you can't do that, cut/paste is ok but such features as line
endings will tend to get messed up).

please send the email directly to Tenney Nathanson, and NOT to the listserv
address by hitting REPLY to this email.  So send to:

tenney@azstarnet.com

(if your email program is set up to read hotlinks, you can just click on
this one:
mailto:tenney@azstarnet.com
)

(but/and: those who are not writers, but have an interest in attending the
workshop, are definitely welcome!)

we're looking forward to receiving work from several Tucson writers--and to
Jackson's workshop and reading.

OTHER MlNDS FESTlVAL VII
BRlNGlNG THE WORLDS OF NEW MUSlC TO THE SAN FRANClSCO BAY AREA MARCH 8-10, 2001

Festival to feature music by Ezra Pound

December 20, 2000 (SAN FRANCISCO) -- Following on the success of its George
Antheil Ballet mecanique concerts in June 2000, Other Minds brings the
latest ideas and trends in new music with OTHER MINDS FESTIVAL VII. The
composer-based festival is a rare opportunity to hear works by great
musical innovators from around the world and the Bay Area. The 2001
festival program spans nearly a century of musical invention, highlighting
early roots of new music and presenting four World Premiere performances.
OTHER MINDS FESTIVAL VII public events include artist forums, and three
evenings of concerts at San Francisco's Cowell Theater, Fort Mason, March
8-10, 2001.
FRIDAY MARCH 9th at 8 PM: The festival will present selected musical works
by the American poet Ezra Pound, who based his compositions on the rhythmic
patterns, cadences and tonal inflections of the poetry of Dante, Sordello,
Villon, Cavalcanti, Catullus and Sappho. He completed two operas and close
to a dozen violin works. The performance celebrates the forthcoming
publication of Robert Hughes' performance edition of Pound's opera
Cavalcanti and introduction to Pound's music and technique.
FEATURED GUEST ARTIST: Violinist Nathan Rubin performs the world premiere
of five recently discovered movements to "Fiddle Music Suite No. 1" by Ezra
Pound. Rubin was concertmaster with the San Francisco Opera's Western Opera
Theater for the 1971 world stage premiere of the Pound/Antheil 1923 Le
Testament, and produced the Fantasy LP recording of that opera in 1972. He
performed the American premieres of Pound's violin works, "Al poco giorno,"
"Faidit," and "Frottola," and was concertmaster with The Arch Ensemble for
the historic 1983 world premiere of Pound's second opera, Cavalcanti, in
San Francisco. Robert Hughes, conductor of the above Le Testament and
Cavalcanti programs, returns to the stage this March to conduct excerpts
from Cavalcanti on this March 9th program. Other Minds will release these
Cavalcanti and violin works on audio CD, to be accompanied by selections
from Le Testament.
SATURDAY, MARCH 10th, 11 AM: An artist forum on the music of Ezra Pound at
the Koret Auditorium of the San Francisco Public Library, Civic Center,
with the participation of Robert Hughes, Margaret Fisher, Nathan Rubin,
Michael Andre Bernstein and Other Minds Executive Director Charles
Amirkhanian.

How Not to Die

Around people
if I feel I'm gonna die
I excuse myself
telling them "I gotta go!"
"Go where?" they wanna know
I don't answer
I just get outa there
away from them
because somehow
they sense something wrong
and never know what to do
it scares them such suddenness
How awful
to just sit there
and they asking:
"Are you okay?"
"Can we get you something?"
"Want to lie down?"
Ye gods! people!
who wants to die amongst people?!
Especially when they can't do shit
To the movies--to the movies
that's where I hurry to
when I feel I'm going to die
So far it's worked

Gregory Corso,
fellow Italian, fellow orphan---
fellow piano player (the description in Desolation Angels....)
I never met him but in writing....
"Power" is at least as good a poem as "Howl"
I'm very glad to see Robert Creeley place Gregory in the company of Duncan
for that is a compliment--
I only wish I could've told GC that he was very appreciated....

thanks to all who responded to my spatial nature of poetry enquiries, i'm
reading 'the poetics of space', gaston bauchelard, at the moment, great
stuff about the of the moment poetic experience, the non-cognitive,
pre-thought response to a word, a line, a poem, which makes it a poetic
moment.
this indeed is one kind of space that poetry happens.
even though i might not agree with his 'reverberation of the soul'
explanation, the reverberation of the psyche, as the poetic moment makes
sense.
there are other spaces that the reader/user of poetry creates with the poem.
there is a cognitive space, where the poem develops an argument and
requires the user to process the information they are receiving.
there is nostalgic or a recalling-of-memory space, which some poems seem to
arouse.
and there is a pictorial space, or imagery, whether single scene,
character, or panorama, which the user and poem create.

i wonder are there any other spaces, metaphorically internal spaces, that
the listener/reader/interactor and poem collaborate to create?

do people on this list find that the paratactic style of much [language]
poetry can put them in that poetic moment state fairly quickly compared to
landscape or panoramic flowing poetry which can sometimes offer that poetic
moment, but most often doesn't.

i am finding with poetry on the net that the element of surprise or
non-predictability afforded by devices like animated texts and hypertext
links and software poetry machines: creating a visual sort of parataxis
from frame to frame, and more of-the-moment poetic experiences per 'cubic
centimetre of cyberspace'.

Not only, but also James Carr
who wrote the song
and also discovered (not invented) the
"falling....down...calling...clown" rhyme--
dead too--

I had just put Graham Parson' version of it on a mix tape
for a special someone (alongside of Christine McVie's "Just Crazy Love"
and other pre-Nicks stuff) and "True Democracy" Steel Pulse stuff,
when I turned on the radio and heard the news....

FEATURING

===Couch Potato Poetics by Dale Smith===

(excerpt) "Poets are outsiders looking in, reading topologies as well as
what lies beneath them. Poets in our economy have no function. They are
instead responsible to the guiding lights of their individual psyches,
intellects and senses, and to the restoration and renewal of the world
through them. Against those vital applications of attention Bernstein
proposes to limit a poets' potential by a self-censure that molds poets of
acceptable social functionality."

==Poet's House by Linh Dinh==

(excerpt) "Chanh is the poet maudit of Saigon. A decade ago, he made a
small fortune dealing in lumber. He then published two volumes of poetry.
The second one, Night Of The Rising Sun, is particularly noteworthy for
its
intense, hallucinatory language. When he wrote that book, Chanh said, he
was staying indoors almost continuously. Inside his darkened room, he
would
scrawl pornographic images on the walls with a pencil. Now unemployed,
Chanh spends his time reading, writing and translating. He is working on a
version of T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land."

J20: counterinauguration


I have found few instances of meaningful mainstream coverage of the
protests on
Saturday. One from the St. Louis Post: "the protesters lent a dramatic -- and
unusual -- element to the largely celebratory atmosphere in the nation’s
capital. As the official procession began to pass Freedom Plaza, three blocks
from the White House, boos cascaded down. When Bush rode by an hour later, the
boos grew so loud that they drowned out chants led by the protest's
organizers.
Among the refrains was: 'George Bush, we know you, your father was a racist
too.'"

For "racist" we also said "killer." Iraq civilians, Texas felons.

Friday night after work I painted a sign onto the back of my old army coat,
black letters in a white box with a stem to resemble a hand-held sign: "End
Sanctions Against Iraq." These sanctions are ten years old.

In Cambridge my jacket merits remarks from a young white guy, kind of drunk I
think, about how the US is now like pre-war Germany. I don’t think so but we
nod and move on. The Third Reich was never subjected to what the Bush Reich is
about to get tomorrow on the parade route. We’re on the subway heading to
Roxbury.

I spent the time between work and meeting Mike listening to Sandanista and the
first Clash album. Mike knows all the words to "Washington Bullets."

Surfacing from the train in Jamaica Plain an older guy passes us going out the
door. Reading my jacket he says "they ought to drop a stink bomb on all of DC
tomorrow." Is he for Bush or against Bush? We don’t know. He keeps moving.

When I’m standing in line at the registration table to get on  one of the four
buses, Roxbury Community College a middle aged white woman says to me, "I’m
standing with you tomorrow; I’m a human being." Her reason for going tomorrow
is also the Iraqi sanctions.

Mike County and Ed, a trade unionist and IAC organizer, Val, and Liane (a
lesbian from Provincetown interested in protesting the witholding of AIDS
medicines from Africa) talk on Bus D while the other buses fill up. Ed has
been
organizing for 27 years. He was at the counter-inauguration of Nixon in 1973.
He’s a shop steward for the food services union at Harvard. He’s old-time
working class Boston. Mike notices this right away. Ed refers to the Boston
Herald as the Herald American, the name it hasn't gone by in over 20 years.

Our bus driver is Paul. By way of introduction he says he is just married and
is looking forward to having his wife join him in Massachusetts because he
hates doing dishes. He's in his 50s. To Mike, me, and Steve (another IAC
organizer) he said outside the bus: "last time I went to DC the bus was filled
with commies, mouthing off, running all up and down the bus." Steve says "you
may find a few of those here tonight."

Frank boards the bus but only to hand us a press release from IAC New York
about today’s court victory. Frank is an IAC organizer. He went to Iraq last
year to deliver food and medicine banned by the sanctions. Ed went too.

People from Food Not Bombs pull into the parking lot in their beat up red van.
They've got dozens of loaves of bread and some kind of stew to hand out to
people. When FNB is not on the Boston Common feeding the homeless they are
usually at a rally or demonstration or something feeding activists. They're
kind of anarchic and wild and even tho I find some of them annoying on a
personal level (I know some from Cambridge) what they do is really remarkable
and admirable. Tonight the bread is good but the strew is cold.

11:20 pm: we pull out of the parking lot, 20 minutes later than scheduled. We
filled the available seats on our bus with a group of students from Brandeis.
We've got exactly enough room for the Providence people. After a brief meeting
with Ed and Eve (the other bus captain) we begin an orientation session.
Everyone introduces themselves and talks about why they are here. Mike is here
to counter the increasing criminalization of public protests. Liane is here
for
AIDS medicines to Africa. Val is here because she believes the Republicans
will
be more vindictive to the gay community than the Democrats were. Eve is here
because she "hates America" and its flourishing police state. Of the Brandeis
students some say "stolen election," some "hate Bush," and a couple just for
the experience of demonstrating. In their wording they all talk about the
"majority of Americans" as a jumping point for their own views. They all
believe they are mainstream. I talk about the sanctions against Iraq, how it's
entering its tenth year and was maintained for 8 years under the Democrats
with
enthusiasm and fervor. I hold up my painted jacket to show them. I say three
basic things in this country are constantly under attack and very much worth
fighting for: legitimate elections, free speech, and the right to peaceably
assemble.

My mentioning of Iraq starts Ed talking about his trip there. Of 50
delegates 7
got seriously ill when they mistakenly washed fruit or brushed their teeth
with
tap water. While looking at a group of children at play in a playground he
thought the scene normal enough; 9-10 year olds at play. Then someone told him
the kids were actually 13-14 years old.

The IAC is the driving force behind the demonstrations tomorrow. They've
formed
coalitions, organized bus caravans, and fought not only for the permit at
Freedom Plaza but also the for the police to articulate beforehand the nature
and guidelines of their actions and responses tomorrow. What Ed stresses in
the
orientation is that no matter what your main concern is, whatever the reason
moving you to protest, is that people protesting are organized as a group and
have unity. The police and elected officials don't want unity. It scares the
government he says, by way of example, that a steelworkers union and a gay and
lesbian rights group start talking to each other and working together. This is
an anarchic organizing principle. This is good politics. I'm glad I came.

Of the Providence group many are Latino and black. People brought their kids
too. A Latino couple, teenagers, sit across the aisle from us and do not
physically unlatch themselves from one another for the entire trip. We do the
orientation again but this time with Spanish translation. In a more formal
presentation I give a summary of the press release in the context of police
tactics that have been used in Seattle, Philadelphia, and LA. Luckily I've
read
about this on my own or my part here would have been relegated to only reading
from the press release. I end up making a speech which wasn't my intention.

In a US District Court the judge (Gladys Kessler) said, "The plaintiffs have
represented not only themselves but all of those who are concerned about the
First Amendment." We will hear the lawyers representing the IAC (a woman and a
man, both pretty young) tomorrow at the demonstration. The press release said:
"yesterday in Court, for the first time the government conceded that they were
not allowed to institute routine body searches or single out demonstrators or
persons based on their race or political affiliation. The police earlier had
refused to be forthcoming." Later it went on, and this was important to know
for the people on the bus, "The government assured the Court that, aside from
visual inspections of containers, the police would be held to the Terry
standard, under which police may not stop or 'pat down' anyone without a
legitimate , articulate suspicion that they have a weapon."

After this orientation, and recruiting for security tomorrow, people drift off
to sleep. I sleep through the entire New Jersey Turnpike, a real blessing. We
stop at a rest stop just before the Delaware Bridge where I pick up possible
one of the worst cups of coffee I've ever had. Sky is brightening. Rain
persists.

A woman, speaking for the IAC, said this week, "we show up at a demonstration
with banners and signs; the cops come at us with guns and tear gas." Who needs
to be watched closely?

Entering Maryland a row of cop cars are moving slowly in the breakdown
lane. Ed
seizes on it and addresses the bus: "Do you feel secure? This is meant to
intimidate you." All their cop lights are flashing. I count the cars: 82 state
troopers plus some unmarked cars too. The bus driver says, "last time I saw
that many cop cars was in Smokey and the Bandit."

Ed tells me and Mike about the Nixon inaugural 27 years ago. Most of the
action, and the biggest crowds, were on the Mall, away from the parade. He was
one of a few thousand on the parade route. The streets were lined with
soldiers, bayonets affixed to rifles. These were fresh recruits and after the
protesters had been chanting for a while the soldiers began chanting with
them.
The motorcade had to stop. They thought the soldiers might join the
demonstrators. They were gathered up and taken away on trucks and regular
police replaced them. Today Ed is expecting Freedom Plaza to be surrounded by
marching bands to drown out the noise of the demonstration.

The trip down stops at Glenmont. Once off the bus Mike and I separate from our
group and hop on the train. The train is filled with signs. We surface at
Metro
West and head toward the designated coffee shop to meet Kaia, Jules, and Tom.
Some friends of their's from Jersey are there. Some NY friends of Lisa
Jarnot's
too. A group waving Puerto Rican flags is across the street. Suddenly they
pose
for pictures with a cop.

A single man in an overcoat and red scarf walks by with "Hail to the Thief"
written on a sign. Unfortunately, this is the kind of protest that will get
the
most attention today. Cops are everywhere. People with signs and banners and
moving down 14th street. I’m on my second cup of coffee. Three hours sleep. No
shower.

When a loud and militant march of demonstrators moves down 14th street they
create such excitement that we rush outside to cheer them. They are mostly
African American and dressed in a kind of militant-cop uniforms with
patches of
Africa sewed to their coats. From a distance I almost mistook them for real
cops. Most of their banners are anti-death penalty. On the sidewalk a young
kid
with a red bandana over his face hands me an American flag. Over the field of
stars the NBC logo is stenciled in white. Over the stripes the word "sold" is
stenciled in black. It's nearing 10:30 and we head down the street.

Located at 14th street and Pennsylvania is one of two checkpoints. I’m
moved by
the energy the protester's drums are creating. The drums are mostly big
plastic
buckets. I see some of my tenant activist friends from Cambridge. Jules and
Kaia leave us at the checkpoint line. They plan to meet up with us later
but we
don't see them again. Neither do we run into anyone from New York, despite
some
hard crowd scanning for Ange's "peach-pink puffy jacket and dot-com glasses,"
and Lisa's long blond hair over a coat that says "Bush sucks" on the back.

We stand at the plaza looking up 14th street hoping to spot our friends
from New
York. The crowd of demonstrators waiting to pass thru the checkpoint area has
thinned. It's a little after 12. Just as I'm thinking the crowd is not that
big
a red banner appears on the crest of 14th street. Others follow. And
puppets and
signs. And wave after wave of people. There is a massive amount of people
suddenly filling the street, like a gate was just opened. It's very
exciting to
watch. They keep on coming. The block is now packed with people waiting to
pass
thru security. And it happens again and again for over an hour. The size of
the
crowd has just tripled in the space of an hour.

We move in and about the plaza which the authorities have neglected to place
portable restrooms on. The only restrooms in the barricaded area are reserved
for military personnel and press. Some poor cadet is left to bear the shouts
and insults of bladder-filled protesters with his little key that opens the
brass locks on the doors. Of these protesters I am the loudest as I begin to
chant "let us pee, let us pee" at the top of my lungs and "open up the john,
open up the john." No luck. Didn’t think there would be. We have to leave the
area, find a public restroom in a mall and then wait in line again to get back
in. As we’re waiting in line a man compliments my jacket-sign. He's well
dressed, as is his date, so I figure they are here to support Bush. He says,
"my parents were from Iraq."

The checkpoints are bullshit. The security is bullshit. People are bottled up
by the hundreds and filing thru the gate one person at a time. Still, we hear
reports that the demonstrators outnumber the Bush supporters today. One such
report supposedly came from CNN.

Mike taunts a group of little boy Marines grouped together with their leader.
He taunts women in fur coats and men in cowboy hats. The whole world is about
to be subjected to the infuriating pain of multiple Texas "yee-haws" as the
country is rolled back about a hundred years in terms of labor and civil
rights. It really makes me want to spit on people. Instead, we approach the
bleachers where a lot of the action seems to be.

The bleachers were guarded by cops and girl scouts ("inaugural volunteers")
until so many demonstrators showed up that they were abandoned,
commandeered by
the demonstrators. I was in this exact same spot 8 years ago when Clinton was
first sworn in. It was sunny then and I was in a much better mood, though no
fan of Clinton. I remember lifting my middle finger to Bush as his helicopter
passed overhead: my reason for coming then. Today I'm giving everyone the
finger who doesn't look like a demonstrator. Fuck them all. As buses and
limousines and SUVs and cops cruise down Pennsylvania Avenue I flip them off
with several thousand other people and yell one of the most powerful chants:
"Bush, murder, Bush, racist!"

To report thousands of people yelling "Bush, murderer, Bush, racist" on the
networks and major news stations would be as foreign to most people as
reporting an alien invasion from Jupiter. I doubt it was reported. But
everyone
on the street can hear us. If it's yelled loud enough it just may become an
issue.

The IAC would have demonstrated today whether Bush was sworn in or Gore, the
actual winner of the election. They applied for permits nine months ago. As
Larry Holmes, IAC organizer and dynamic speaker, made note to the crowd, the
death machine keeps moving efficiently whether the Democrats or Republicans
are
in control. The IAC is here to oppose a variety of "bipartisan" issues
(meaning
both parties support them): the death penalty, sanctions against Iraq,
embargoes and sanctions against 30 other countries, the escalating military
support for the Columbian regime. They support movements to free both Mumia
Abu
Jamal and Leonard Peletier, pro-choice movements, pro-lesbian and gay
community
movements, anti-free trade agreements, movements to ban depleted uranium,
anti-US involvement in Colombia, anti-blockade of Cuba. These, plus the ever
widening banner of official racism under which all these things fall.

Chant: "hey Bush, we know you, your father was a killer too."

The rain has picked up. People are soaked. Still, the sound system is loud. I
can hear drums beating from other parts of the plaza. From the bench I’m
standing on I can see down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol. Lines and
lines of cops and military personnel along the street standing perfectly
still.
Sharpshooters on the roofs of surrounding buildings. Just like 8 years ago.

Eight years ago however people weren't yelling at the cops and waving their
middle finger at them. What do the cops look like? Their faces are stone. I
imagine they would like nothing better than to beat the hell out the
demonstrators. If I were a cop I know I would. Of course I can't ever imagine
becoming a cop. The cops probably can't ever imagine doing the things to the
American flag that I've done today. Nor painting a political slogan on their
back. And yet the cop unions are very strong unions. And the prison
industry is
very profitable. They would probably like very much to jail everyone not
clapping for the parade.

When the US Marine marching band passes us the crowd yells and boos so loud
that I can't hear a note of music.

Other speakers the IAC has brought include representatives from various
movement committees: a Native American man from the Free Leonard Peletier
committee. He's wearing Ray-ban sunglasses and some kind of brilliantly
colored
Native American outfit. He begins "we've been trying to get Peletier free for
18 fucking years…" And they probably thought it would happen 8 years ago.
That’s when a campaigning Governor Clinton pledged that he would grant
Peletier
a pardon if elected. Eight years later he didn't do it. Why? He sat around in
his final weeks of office granting pardons left and right to corporate
criminals. Then he made sure his own ass was secure from prosecution for the
farce sex scandal, etc. He had no political clout to lose from freeing
Peletier. He couldn't even damage a Democrat successor by doing so. Why didn't
he? Clinton is a chump; an opportunist who has capitulated on every important
issue for eight solid years. It's as simple as that. That, and the FBI are
dead-set against it.

An activist from Korea speaks. A Zapatista speaks in Spanish. One of the main
IAC organizers (from NYC) speaks, plus the two lawyers who fought in court for
permits and so on. A tall black man from New York speaks several times and
leads chants. Very powerful. One ends, perfectly intoned: "no justice, no
fucking peace."

Across the street an temporary enclosed platform hosts various dignitaries.
Rudy Guiliani is one of them. We chant for him when he's visible: we remember
Amadou; you're a racist, murderer and Nazi. That kind of thing. He takes
pictures of the crowd. What a smug prick. This is what to expect for the
next 8
years, the leadership of smug pricks, perhaps less erect than departing
leadership.

Larry Holmes is an IAC organizer and also leader of the movement to free Mumia
Abu Jamal. He was at the Nixon inaugural in 1973 also, Ed tells us later. He
was there on "union business/ air force" he said, which was code for AWOL. In
the IAC press release he had said, "We believe that the police never intended
to give us a permit or to allow demonstrators to have access to Pennsylvania
Avenue and the inaugural route. Security issues were a ruse. The real goal of
the police and government was to shield the Bush administration from the
political embarrassment of having thousands of demonstrators lining the parade
route."

On the bus later Ed tells us that the NBC, which had a giant movable TV
cameraman on a platform (like a fire ladder or cherry picker) right over
Freedom Plaza had approached the IAC when they saw the enormity of the
demonstration. NBC was going to do a shot of the demonstrators right at the
time Bush passed it in his car. At that time they would interview an IAC
representative for commentary. Of course this never happened. The Bush people
learned of it and immediately contacted NBC to stop it. I wonder what they
traded; an exclusive interview or something. Either way it was this that
caused
the parade to be delayed by about an hour.

After Bush's car passes we leave. Up on  14th Street a man walking against the
crowd with his children shouts "Say goodbye to the Arkansas rapist." I yell
back, “Say hello to the Texas cokehead.”

Subject:      a+bend press chapbook sale
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

tho currently on a production hiatus, during the 20-month span of april 1999
to november 2000, a+bend press published 40 chapbooks.

now, many of these chapbooks are sitting in the a+bend press basement, just
waiting for attention...chapbooks by authors such as fanny howe, cole
swensen, david bromige, lisa jarnot, jo ann wasserman...and so many others...

a book sale seemed like just the thing to bring renewed attention to these
fabulous titles. so here, have a book sale:
*****for orders postmarked on or before feb 14, chapbooks will be sold for $4
instead of the usual $5 (20% off), and you get free shipping. hooray!*****

a list of all 40 titles, along with excerpts, cover scans, (some) reviews,
etc, are available for viewing at
http://www.durationpress.com/abend/index.html (durationpress.com also hosts
lots of other small presses and magazines--check 'em out!) so go look, send a
list of what you'd like along with your address and a check made out to
either a+bend press or jill stengel, and i'll send the books on over to ya.

please note: book orders not postmarked after feb 14 will once again be their
usual $5 plus shipping of $1 for one book/$1.50 for more than one book.
additionally, there may be a slight delay in order fulfillment after this
date, as i'm expecting a baby in late feb/early march.

another note: the book sale is for individuals only, not for institutions

thanks for your attention to this matter, and to these books, and to poetry,
and to small press publishing, and and and--
thanks--

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics List was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its second incarnation,
the list carries over 800 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time.
A number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
at the Electronic Poetry Center (see section 10 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the increasing
number of subscribers, we are no longer able to maintain the
open format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).
All submissions are reviewed by the moderators in keeping with
the goals of the list, as articulated in this Welcome Message.
We remain committed to this editorial function as a defining
element of the Poetics List. Our aim is to support, inform, and
extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of
the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
impossible.

For further information on posting to the list, see sections 3 and 4.
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 8.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 8
for details.

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project. For subscription information
or to contact the moderators, write to <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list should provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators
at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all
of the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

      unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and send this one-line message, with no "subject" line
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

      sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name. If you
find that it is not possible to unsub using your old address,
please contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by
contacting the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by
the moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated
in this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. Feel
free to query the list moderators if you are uncertain as to whether
a message is appropriate. All correspondence with the editors
regarding submissions to the list remains confidential and should
be directed to us at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published,
or in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core
function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications
are always welcome. We also welcome discussions of poetry and poetics
in keeping with the editorial function of the list.

Solicited contributions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) may
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The moderators reserve
the right to contact any subscriber regarding possible contributions.

Send messages to the list directly to the list address:

      <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 4 below.
Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 9.

-------------------

4. Cautions

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post, since this may make it
difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.
Messages containing attachments will be presumed to be
worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Posting on the list is a form of publication. However, please do
not publish list postings without the express permission of the author!
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without
the author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair
use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 5 messages
per day from any one subscriber; in general, we expect subscribers
to keep their post to less than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is
a manageable list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers)
of twenty-five or fewer messages per day.

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat offenders
will be removed from the list immediately. Please do not put this
policy to test!

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the moderators at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

5. Subscription Options

It is possible to receive the Poetics List as separate posts
or as daily digests. When you subscribe, the default setting is
"regular," meaning you will receive a separate email for each post.
To change options, send a one-line message, always beginning with
"set" with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

With a "regular" subscription, you receive individual postings
immediately, as they are processed by LISTSERV. To change to this
option if you are currently not getting the list in this form send
the one-line message:

set poetics nodigest

Digest:
With a "digest" subscription, you receive larger messages (called
"digests") at regular intervals, usually once per day or once per
week. These "digests" are collections of individual list postings.
Some lists are so active that they produce several digests per day.

Digests are a good compromise between reading everything as it is
posted and feeling like the list is clogging your mailbox with a
multitude of individual postings.

There are three digest formats: a "traditional", text-only format;
a MIME format; and an HTML format. Because posts sent over the list
with HTML coding disrupt the format of the text-only digest, we
recommend that you use the MIME or html versions. If your mail reader
works with HTML, choose that; if not, try MIME, although you may find
the HTML version will also work for you.

To change your digest options, send these messages to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

Digest (traditional): set poetics digest [We DO NOT recommend this]
Digest (MIME format): set poetics nohtml mime digest
Digest (HTML format) set poetics html digest

Index:
With an "index" subscription, you receive short "index" messages
at regular intervals, usually once per day or once per week. These
"indexes" show you what is being discussed on the list, without
including the text of the individual postings. For each posting,
the date, the author's name and address, the subject of the message
and the number of lines is listed. You can then follow instructions
provided in the index to download messages of interest from the
server.

An index subscription is ideal if you have a slow connection and
only read a few hand-picked messages. The indexes are very short
and you do not have to worry about long download times. The drawback
of course is that you need to maintain your internet connection or
reconnect to order messages of interest from the server.

You can choose to have the index sent to you in either a traditional
format (plain text) or in HTML format with hyperlinks. Using the HTML
index, you may click on a link provided with each message to open your
web browser to that message in the Poetics List archive.

Send the "set" to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

       Index (traditional): set poetics nohtml index
       Index (HTML format): set poetics html index

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this
message:

       set poetics nodigest

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Please do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

      set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

      set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 9 below.)

-------------------

7. "No Review" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information.

-------------------

8. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

The EPC's mission is to serve as a gateway to the extraordinary
range of activity in formally innovative writing and digital media
poetry in the United States and around the world. The Center provides
access to extensive resources in new poetries. These include our
E-POETRY library, our links to digital VIDEO and SOUND (including
our award-winning LINEbreak series of radio interviews and performances)
as well as e-journals such as lume, Deluxe Rubber Chicken, Alyricmailer,
and many others, the POETICS List archives, an AUTHOR library of
electronic poetry texts and bibliographies, and direct connections
to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides
information about contemporary electronic poetry magazines and print
little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics.
Visit the EPC's many libraries, the featured resources available on
the EPC home page, or its NEW listings, where recent additions are
available for quick access.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

-------------------

9. Poetics Archives at the EPC

Go to the Electronic Poetry Center <http://epc.buffalo.edu>
and select the "Poetics" link from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. Or set your browser to go directly to
<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html>.

You may browse the Poetics List archives by month and year or
search them for specific information. Your interface will allow
you to print or download any of these files.

Please note that it is possible to toggle between proportional
and non-proportional fonts in viewing archived messages; a
feature that may be useful to interpret messages reliant on
the neat spacing of a proportional font, or that require the
"word wrap" feature of same - and useful, too, for aesthetic
reasons. To change the display font of an archived message,
simply follow the "proportional font" or "non-proportional font"
link at the top of the message.

is that Parsons,  or the Flying Burrito Bros?  i don't have a verson
by him post-burritos... (and would want it if there is one)

More importantly:  Carr was not exactly a songwriter... the composer
of Dark End of the Street is Dan Penn

While I recognize that posts of a political nature are quite welcome on this
list, it seems that many of them take for granted that everyone here (except
the outspoken Mr. Dillon) shares liberal, left-wing priorities.

May I point out that we do not all share these priorities.

With that in mind, and in this season of clashing ideologies, wouldn't it be
wonderful to concentrate on the central purpose of the list (about which I'm
sure all of us can rally): "To support, inform, and extend those directions
in poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations
of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles,
and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected,
improbable, and impossible."

I'm *not* trying to play the role of moderator, good people; consider this a
plea for some poetry talk -- or a more open-minded political discussion.

I assume that's John Tranter, the great poet and editor of Jacket?

Good luck with the reading, Prageeta sahiba.

By the way, do you know Hindi? Love to correspond in Hindi/Urdu sometime.

Subject:      how to contact Feinstein & other senators re: Ashcroft
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Apologies to those who will get this more than once, but . . .

Sen. Dianne Feinstein hasn't indicated which way she'll vote on Ashcroft
but her recent comments seem to suggest (to me, anyway) that she'll go
for cozy collegiality and vote to confirm. We can at least let her know
what we think. Phoning has more impact than email and is cheap before 8
am.

They'll ask for your zip code if you're in California. If you email from
CA, it's best to include your street address so they know you vote here.

Feinstein phone in D.C.: (202) 224-3841
Email: senator@feinstein.senate.gov

If you wish to contact another senator, phone the United States Capitol
switchboard at (202) 224-3121 and an operator will connect you directly
with the Senate office you request.

There are email addresses and phone numbers for all senators on this
page:

http://www.senate.gov/contacting/index.cfm

Thanks, folks--please forward this information to likeminded others.

D.I.Y Poetry
(do it all by yourself)

The Do It Yourself philosophy isn't foreign to the
punk scene.  For any punk band to release a CD or a 7"
themselves is relatively cheap and easy to do.  A few
shows is all the advertising you need.  But in the
poetry "scene" (which, by the way, doesn't really
exist), it is not so easy.  The community structure
that we all wish was more focused upon in the punk
scene, exists not ta all among poets.

There are countless "local" poets, just as there are
countless local bands.  However, there are not
countless local poetry readings like there are local
punk shows (at least around here).  Which is a shame.

Poets, in general, are striving to get published.
Which is basically the equivalent of getting signed.
There are indy publishers just as there are indy
record labels.  However, in punk, if you put out your
own record, you're seen as a contributing member of
the scene.  The D.I.Y. ethic is strong there.  For
poets thought, it's different.  According to the
thoughts of most published poets, you are not really
and truly a poet until you are published.  At least in
a "literary journal" (basically a compilation).

I was talking to a well published poet not that long
ago.  He was talking about his new book that is being
put out by some university press (though not quite as
bad as major labels, they're almost as bad for many
many reasons).   I congratulated him, he seemed
genuinely happy.  and told him that I too had my
second book coming out.  "Oh!  That's great!," he
said and meant, "who is publishing it for you?"  I
explained that I was doing it myself, running off
copies myself, even binding it myself.  His face
dropped.  His voice fumbled out, "Oh... well, yes..
that's probably a lot of fun."  Long awkward pause.
He spoke up again, "Why don't you submit your work to
some publishers?  Or get an agent?"  Told him that I
didn't want all of that.  We all know there is no
money in writing, whether you're professionally
published or you publish yourself, so why not take the
time to do it yourself?  You can keep your own costs
to a bare minimum and pass that savings onto your
readers!

My most recent book sells for two dollars.  It costs
me 50 cents (no including labor) to make each copy.
That means, if I do not sell wholesale (which that
price is a buck, btw), I can give away three out of
every four of them and still break even!  Thus far,
I've given out more than that.

For me, it's not about money or a name for myself.
It's about writing and putting out what I wrote.  It
shouldn't be anyone else's concern or job to put my
work out for me.  I wrote it, I should publish it, if
that's what I want to do.

This ethic is pretty common in punk.  Demo tapes (CD's
now), for example.  It's nearly unheard of and very
much looked down upon in the realms of poetry.  Some
things need changing everywhere you go.

Lori, George Bowering, and other Canadians on the list:

In doing an anthology such as this, how do you handle questions of
multilingualism?  Are French (or, for that matter, Inuit) poems also
included?  Is the assumption that it would be monolingual -- and
would there be a separate French anthology?  Are there no "Canadian
pomo long poems" in French?  I am not trying to agitate separatist
nationalism, but I'm curious how this is thought through, especially
considering the strong sentiment in Quebec, and the
legal/political/cultural ways Canada is trying to deal with that
sentiment.  Although not officially bilingual, the same question
applies to similar anthologies in the US.  For example, do
anthologies include poems in Spanish, Chinese, etc., or when we say
"US poems" we mean, almost automatically, those in English and a
separate category (usually "multicultural") is set up for poems in
other languages (or, for that matter, even in English but from
"minority" ethnic groups)?  I'm not even sure of the virtues of such
multilingualism -- while I can read French or Spanish, I can't read
Chinese, and it would do me little good to have poems in Chinese (or
would this mean the necessity of accompanying translations)?  I'm
sure folks in Canada have had some experience dealing with these
questions and it would be enlightening to hear peoples' ideas.

How would you propose to discuss those "directions in poetry" absent a
sustained discussion of those "other" areas of public discourse that inform
them? I have trouble imagining my own work as a poet, or my poetics more
broadly, apart from my political commitments and engagements, private
idiosyncrasies, and affective relationships. This is not at all to say that
my poems or my thinking in poetics are "about" these things (though
sometimes they are), but that they take place in a field of discursive and
extra-discursive practices that cannot be -- and probably shouldn't be --
purified of such extraneous matter. That this is not exclusively a matter of
concern to the political and cultural left (in the interest of disclosure,
yes, guilty as charged) seems evident to me in Mr. Dillon's own occasional
forays into verse on the list, which, far from attempting to remove his
political angle from the aesthetic equation, have worked toward
instantiating it as inseparable from the poetic form of the work. (Thus, the
recent debate over diction in his Ed Dorn memorial piece).

When it comes down to it, I guess I'd be hard pressed to imagine a better
way to further erase poetry from any meaningful location in public
intellectual life than to adopt a program of "denatured" aesthetics that
banishes the political to the curbside while leaving poetry undisturbed in
the study. That said, I'll be the first to admit that contemporary poetics
are often quick to confuse and substitute a politicized art writing for the
broader practice of politics. But this is a struggle I'd like to see given
room to play out in situ, rather than articulate some sort of administrative
formula at the outset for what's admissible and what's not. What I've often
found admirable about Dan's work is its willingness to interrogate this
relationship between his activism and his poetics, to draw out the
connections while not absorbing either practice entirely into the other. Of
course, I'll be the first to concede that your estimation of that project
might be severely qualified if you fundamentally disagree with the politics.
So be it -- though such qualification hasn't stopped my reading Pound,
Eliot,  or Stevens, for example.

As to the other objection you raise, I have to confess that I'm not sure
what the problem is. Would it help to have a disclaimer attached to the
subject line of all "political" posts: "Warning: There may be room for
ideological conflict in what follows?" I thought that was given in the very
nature of the political itself -- certainly, you seem to have taken it as
such in articulating the sort of response you have. (Though a bit more
specificity might lead to a more productive argument, since broadly
characterized "liberal, left-wing priorities" mean an awful lot of different
things to an awful lot of different people).

I'm also not sure I see the taking for granted of a shared perspective that
you find in Dan's post, unless the means by which one would demonstrate that
one didn't thus take things for granted were not to post at all. In other
words, my acknowledgement that there are other political and cultural
agendas present on the list in no way obligates me to refrain from arguing
for my own simply in order to spare you the trouble of having to disagree --
or, more likely, ignore me.

While I recognize that posts of a political nature are quite welcome on this
list, it seems that many of them take for granted that everyone here (except
the outspoken Mr. Dillon) shares liberal, left-wing priorities.

May I point out that we do not all share these priorities.

With that in mind, and in this season of clashing ideologies, wouldn't it be
wonderful to concentrate on the central purpose of the list (about which I'm
sure all of us can rally): "To support, inform, and extend those directions
in poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations
of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles,
and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected,
improbable, and impossible."

I'm *not* trying to play the role of moderator, good people; consider this a
plea for some poetry talk -- or a more open-minded political discussion.

apologies for cross-posting, but i am looking and/or it might be an
interesting project for a student in avariety of fields.

I am working on a 'social infopoem' at
http://members.tripod.com/~trbell/metaphor/fgid.htm  the poem comes out of
my experiences over the course of a couple of days as a member of an
internet self-help support group for people with a chronic disease that
probably many people have never heard of.  Related to the events of those
two days was a pharmaceuticl company's withdrawing from the market a drug
(the first of it's kind) that was helpful for many people.  Many people were
unhappy about this and formed a mailing list which has now become three
mailing lists with an associated website
http://geocities.com/lotronexactiongroup/index.html  The purpose of this
movement is to restore the drug and apply pressure for some systemic reform.
It is definitely a process piece and it is currently in process which is one
reasone why i don't have time to write up the process.  Ive been told that
the NYT might do something on it next week but don't think I can be quoted
on that.

Gregory Corso; Poet Influenced Fellow Writers in Beat Generation

By ELAINE WOO, Times Staff Writer

Gregory Corso, a streetwise poet who was a central member of the Beat
movement along with Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, died Wednesday in a
hospital in suburban Minneapolis.

He was 70 and had been suffering from prostate cancer.

Corso, who had a disastrous childhood and discovered literature while
incarcerated, saw poetry as an ethical act that could change society. The
Beat movement that embraced him presaged the social and political unrest of
the 1960s.

"Sometimes Allen Ginsberg used to say that he was a fraud and that Gregory
was the true great poet of the Beat generation," said poet Lewis MacAdams.
"He was the real Beat, a street-singing genius. He lived the life and died
the death of a poet who had given his entire life to that arcane and
magnificent art."

Corso wrote or contributed to more than 20 books of poetry, the most notable
of which include "Bomb," "Elegiac Feelings American" and "Gasoline."

He moved to San Francisco too late to participate in what is often cited as
the first major public event in the evolution of the Beat
movement--Ginsberg's reading of his seminal poem, "Howl"--but he wrote with
Ginsberg one of its manifestos, an article called "The Literary Revolution
in America."

Corso was an "orphan street kid adopted by the Beats," said Herbert Gold,
novelist and author of "Bohemia: Digging the Roots of Cool," who spent time
with Corso, Ginsberg and other Beat poets in Paris in the late 1950s. "Most
of the Beats were middle-class college kids, but Corso came out of real
poverty. That made him different."

Corso was born in New York City to teenage parents who separated soon after
his birth. He lived in orphanages and foster homes until he was 11, when his
father took him in. His formal education ended at sixth grade.

At 12 he was in trouble with the law for selling a stolen radio and spent
several months behind bars. Abused by other prisoners, he later spent three
months under observation at Bellevue Hospital.

At 16 he was incarcerated again, this time with a three-year term for theft.
He began to read classics by Dostoevsky, Stendahl, Shelley and Marlowe.

After his release, he went to work as a manual laborer in New York, as a
reporter for the old Los Angeles Examiner, and as a merchant seaman on ships
bound for Africa and South America.

In 1950, he was working on his first poems when he met Ginsberg in a
Greenwich Village bar, and Ginsberg encouraged his writing. Corso soon met
Kerouac and seduced his girlfriend, which became the plot of Kerouac's novel
"The Subterraneans."

Critics found echoes of Corso in Ginsberg's work, but their voices remained
distinct. Compared to Ginsberg, Corso was "calm and quick, whimsical often,
witty rather than humorous, semantically swift rather than prophetically
incantatory," Geoffrey Thurley wrote in a piece collected in "The Beats:
Essays in Criticism."

Corso's first poems were published in 1955 in the Harvard Advocate. His
first collection, "The Vestal Lady on Brattle and Other Poems," was financed
by Harvard and Radcliffe students. Lawrence Ferlinghetti's City Lights Books
published his next collection, "Gasoline," in 1958.

In his early books, images of imprisonment and violence were central. His
poetry sometimes provoked violent reactions. When he read "Bomb" at Oxford,
members of the college poetry society hurled their shoes at him. That poem
was a commentary on atomic weapons that appeared on the printed page in the
shape of a mushroom cloud. "O Bomb, I love you I want to kiss your clank,
eat your boom . . . "

In "The Literary Revolution," he declared himself part of a movement of
American poets who believed in the power of their words to evoke change.
These poets, he and Ginsberg wrote, "have taken it upon themselves, with
angelic clarions in hand, to announce their discontent, their demands, their
hope, their final wondrous unimaginable dream."

In "Marriage," widely considered his finest poem, Corso showed a different
side of himself, writing with humor and optimism about a nervous groom on
the brink of wedlock, teetering between malicious musings: "I'd sit there
the Mad Honeymooner/devising ways to break marriages, a scourge of bigamy/a
saint of divorce." And more worrisome thoughts: "Because what if I'm 60
years old and not married/all alone in a furnished room . . . and everybody
else is married! all the universe married but me!"

Survivors include five children, seven grandchildren and one
great-grandchild.

Gregory Corso, a Candid-Voiced Beat Poet, Dies at 70

By WILLIAM H. HONAN

Gregory Corso, a poet and leading member of the Beat literary movement that
shook American social and political life in the late 1950's and 60's, died
on Wednesday in Robbinsdale, Minn., where he lived with his daughter Sheri
Langerman. He was 70.

The cause was prostate cancer, Ms. Langerman said.

To the literary world, Mr. Corso was considered less political than Allen
Ginsberg, less charismatic than Jack Kerouac, but more shocking, at times,
than either of them. In his book, "The Beat Generation" (Scribner, 1971),
Bruce Cook calls Mr. Corso "the most avid nose- thumber of them all," a man
regarded as a nemesis by those who detested his "hip, easy, wiseguy manner
and direct artless diction."

A put-on specialist at poetry readings, Mr. Corso would delight his fans and
inflame his critics by muttering into a microphone disconnected thoughts
like "fried shoes," "all life is a Rotary Club" and "I write for the eye of
God."

But he could also be a serious social critic, re-examining an institution
like marriage, said Ann Douglas, a professor of American studies at Columbia
University. The lines of his poem "Marriage," for example, are wry and
optimistic. The poet begins by asking playfully, "Should I get married?
Should I be good?" and concludes constructively: "Ah, yet well I know that
were a woman possible as I am possible then marriage would be possible."

Mr. Corso's early work helped pave the way for the feminists of a later
generation, Professor Douglas said. "Women looked at Corso and the other
Beats," she said, "and asked, `If these men can free themselves from
constricted gender roles - getting married, working for a corporation and so
on - why can't we?' "

Mr. Corso's finest poem, most critics agree, is "Elegiac Feelings American,"
which is an elegy for his friend Kerouac and for dead notions of America and
a new hope:

O and yet when it's asked of you `What happened to him?'

I say, "What happened to America has happened

to him - the two were inseparable" Like the wind

to the sky is the voice to the word. . . .

Like other Beat poets, Mr. Corso's work was less elegantly stylized than
that of his predecessors, and closer to ordinary feelings. It was personal
and candid in the expression of intimate feelings - sexual desire, despair
and things that would not have surfaced in an earlier time.

While Ginsberg and Kerouac came from upper-middle-class backgrounds and got
to know each other through Columbia University, Mr. Corso's upbringing was
troubled.

Gregory Nunzio Corso was born on March 26, 1930, in New York, the son of
teenage parents who parted when he was a year old. He bounced in and out of
foster homes and jails and never made it to high school. At 12 he was caught
selling stolen merchandise and sent to prison for several months while
awaiting trial.

His fellow inmates were "terribly abusive," he wrote years later in an
autobiographical sketch. When acquitted, he spent three months under
observation in Bellevue Hospital.

When Mr. Corso was 16 he returned to jail to serve a three-year sentence for
theft. It was then that he read the classics - Dostoevsky, Stendhal, Shelley
and Christopher Marlowe among others - but also became, as he expressed it,
"educated in the ways of men at their worst and at their best."

He once told an interviewer for Contemporary Authors: "Sometimes hell is a
good place - if it proves to one that because it exists, so must its
opposite, heaven, exist. And what was heaven? Poetry."

Mr. Corso was released from prison in 1950. Soon after, at a bar in
Greenwich Village, he encountered Ginsberg. Mr. Corso was then writing
fairly conventional verse, and it was Ginsberg who introduced him to long
Whitmanesque lines and surreal word combinations.

At this time in his life, Mr. Corso was traveling the country, working as a
laborer, as a reporter for The Los Angeles Examiner and as a merchant
seaman.

In 1954 he settled briefly in Cambridge, Mass., where he virtually took up
residence at the Harvard University library, poring over the great works of
poetry. His first published poems appeared in the Harvard Advocate, and his
play, "In This Hung-Up Age," a macabre drama about how a group of tourists
are trampled to death by a herd of buffalo, was performed the next year by
Harvard students.

His later poetry exhibited an eclectic vocabulary. Referring to his study of
the dictionary, Mr. Corso told the critic Michael Andre that he "got that
whole book in me, all the obsolete and archaic words. And through that I
knew that I was in love with language and vocabulary, because the words and
the way they looked to me, the way they sounded, and what they meant, how
they were defined and all that, I tried to revive them, and I did."

Mr. Corso moved to San Francisco in 1956, too late to attend Ginsberg's
famous reading of "Howl" but in time to be recognized as a major Beat poets.
In an introduction to Mr. Corso's early collection "Gasoline" (City Lights,
1958), Ginsberg called him "a great word-swinger, first naked sign of a
poet, a scientific master of mad mouthfuls of language."

Later, with Ginsberg, the two poets wrote a manifesto, "The Literary
Revolution in America," in which they announced their convention- bashing
"discontent, their demands, their hope, their final wondrous unimaginable
dream."

While Mr. Corso was never as politically involved as some of the other
Beats, in 1965 he was dismissed from a teaching position at the State
University of New York at Buffalo because he refused to sign an affidavit
certifying that he was not a member of the Communist Party.

In recent years, Mr. Corso continued to write, teach and lecture. He
published 13 books of poetry, two books of plays and several collaborations.


Mr. Corso's first marriage, to Sally November, ended in divorce.

In addition to Ms. Langerman of Minneapolis, he is survived by his second
wife, Belle Carpenter of Santa Fe, N.M.; two other daughters, Miranda
Schubert of Manhattan and Cybelle Carpenter of Minneapolis; two sons, Max
Corso of Guam and Nile Corso of Hamden, Conn.; his mother, Margaret Davita
of Trenton; a brother, Joe Corso of Long Island; seven grandchildren; and a
great-grandchild.

Mr. Corso often played the wayward child among his friends. The novelist
Herbert Gold recalled sitting with him and other Beat writers in a Paris
cafe when Mr. Corso impulsively snatched the check, exclaiming, "I never
paid a check before!" Ginsberg, Mr. Gold said, "took the check from him and
gave it to me with a reproachful glance at Gregory. It was assumed that
Gregory would never be able to pay a check."

Taylor--

You're right, I'm sorry; Dan Bouchard's piece has more merit than I
initially credited it.  It is a story, not a "sign this petition" email, so
it's better.  Plus it has a flair for the dramatic: "I'm on my second cup of
coffee. Three hours sleep. No shower."  Good stuff!

And you're also right: I wouldn't think of trying to talk about poetry
without political, spiritual, physical, social, sexual, etc etc all in the
mix.  No curbside versus study here.  Let's have it all together.

What I was really talking about is the taking-it-for-granted quality-- Posts
like Rachel Loden's recent "We're not sure where Senator Feinstein stands on
Ashcroft, but we can give her a call"-- the damn email doesn't even clarify
that it's opposed to Ashcroft, and yet it asks me to forward it to
"likeminded others". It implies that the issue has only one side, and that
implication, when it reaches a critical mass of thirty similar emails, is a
discourse killer.

It may please Mr. Dillon to know that I have this taped to my wall to stave
of utter discouragement: "The continued attacks on Conservative persons and
institutions by members of this community, as if it were mere sport, divides
and alienates, it rivens society and poisons the common spring of language.
It is a bullying behavior because it does not permit a comeback from the
other quarter."

Nope. What usually happens is that we anglos publish anthologies and
call them Canadian poetry, while the francos publish anthologies and
call them Quebec poetry. Sometimes someone, always on the Engl. side,
does something in both languages, but it seldom results in anything.
But just as the Engl. side is split between us hip folk and those
others, so the Quebec scene is likewise split, though the parameters
are not identical; but we hip folk connect with the hip folk over
there, you see. We publish, translate, talk, travel together often,
but this happens because we share a poetic, not a language. See the
collaborations between Daphne Marlatt and Nicole Brossard, for
example. Or Gail Scott's self-definition among group of writers who
are French-language people.

My website, Comprepoetica (url below, I hope), is slowly
bumbling back into life.  I started it a little over
three years ago, partly to act as a despository for
bios of contemporary poets--an egalitarian one that accepts
entries on anyone describing himself as a poet.  There's
a questionnaire at the site that poets (and critics and even just
poetry-readers) can fill out.  From the data I get from it,
I'll make an entry at my site.  For quite a while, over a
year, I let the site, and the bios, drift, hardly doing anything
with it.  There didn't seem much point as hardly anyone was
visiting the site except me, and those with entries or other
material at it.  Recently, though, I've put the latest six or
seven entries online (unedited--for now, at any rate), and now
have 76 up.

I've also added a lot of my Small Press Review columns, having
decided a couple of years ago to store them at my site, but soon
not bothering.  There are now 33 columns online, from June 1993 to
late in 1998.  The columns are uneven, but I think some are pretty
good--and the March/April 1998 one may amuse those of you who were
around here for the squabble I started in 1997 about a Marjorie Perloff
seminar allegedly on visual poetry.

Drop in sometime--and maybe send me a bio.

Is it permissable to induce vomitting on
someone's shoes if they praise a poem you have
written for its "images" ?(you know the look -
closed eyes - in a a semi-rapturous swoon you may
see on a gas sniffer - babbling about "beautiful
images")

Is it permissable to induce vomitting on a book
reviewer's shoes at a cocktail party? I don't
even mean if they wrote you a negative review, I
mean just for the fact that they write book
reviews, can you can ruin their loafers with
digested canapes?

Is it permissable to stick your chapbook into the
poetry section at Chapters when no one is
looking?

Is it permissable to spit on someone if when you
tell them you are a poet they ask you to write a
poem for their girlfriend in jail, and could it
talk about the first night they met at a local
bar as the local band was tearing down their
gear?

Is it permissable to recieve guilty pleasure in
reading the poetry collections of famous dead
rock stars?

Is it permissable to wipe with a formula
rejection letter and send it to the editor's home
FedEx on his birthday?

Is it permissable to write multilingual sestina
using the word "gumption" as an end-word?

Is it permissable to consider tapioca and
engine-block as slant slant rhyme?

Just some questions. I realise it's not about the
election - thus utterly unconnected with poetry -
but this is what keeps me up at night...

nothing wrong with DIY as i see it - i mean if yr
gonna go broke, might as well do it on yr own
terms right?

call it ego tho - or lack of confidence - there
is something to be said for having someone show
interest and confidence in yr work - and
relieving you of the details

even if i choose to self-publish i am probably
gonna need to hire a printer - and there is also
something to be said for specialisation of labour

everybody knows Whitman self-published - but then
again so did a billion other yahoos who gave the
whole notion a bad name - the publishing game, as
rude as it can be - can act as a "filter" - i
have never read a single self-published work that
in anyway impressed me - tho of course there is
always the lone genius so far ahead of their time
no one will touch them, they are the exeption -
more often than not, if no editor has deigned to
publish their work there is a reason

the beauty of self-publishing is is that anyone
can do it

the horror of self-publishing is... the same
thing

it really does depend on yr aims i think - and
who you are trying to reach

| PhillyTalks 18 (33 pages)
| C. S. Giscombe / Barry McKinnon
| responses by Wayde Compton, George Elliott Clarke, giovanni singleton

  ** now available as pdf download at: http://phillytalks.org

| Friday Feb. 2nd, 7:30 pm Mountain Time
| (9:30 pm Eastern)


NB: The live component of PhillyTalks 18 will take place at the Rozsa
Centre, University of Calgary (Alberta, Canada), not at its usual venue,
Kelly Writers House, Philadelphia. To participate in the live audiocast of
the event, for which 25 spaces are available on the server, sign-in
*immediately* at the webcasts mailing list at:

        >> http://phillytalks.org/listserve/webcasts


[ The Event ]
Cecil Giscombe and Barry McKinnon were invited to begin a dialogue
on/across their work, for this newsletter and the "PhillyTalks" project.
Poets Wayde Compton, George Elliott Clarke and giovanni singleton were
then invited to respond to the fact of a Giscombe/McKinnon talk, and
specifically to their exchange-they had about a week in which to formulate
responses: not a lot of time.

[ The Poets ]
C.S. Giscombe's recent book is the travelog, Into and Out of Dislocation
(New York: North Point, 2000): "it's an African-American archetype-culture
occurs in landscape- and here I am, the first generation born across the
Ohio River (and born, admittedly, bourgeois), still having the impulse,
north!, though it's metaphorized into something other than the sane set of
reasons-for-migration that belonged to those who went earlier" (136). His
recent poetry book is Giscome Road (Normal, IL: Dalkey Archive, 1998);
before that, Here (Dalkey, 1994), whose poems "move in intricately woven
patterns (like the candid language of risky dreams) [...] post-personal
yet not quite public" (Clarence Major). The poems featured in PhillyTalks
18 are from Inland, soon to appear from Leroy Books (San Francisco). He
teaches at Penn State U, State College, Pennsylvania.

Barry McKinnon is author of PulpLog (Prince George, BC: Caitlin,
1991)-winner of the Dorothy Livesay poetry prize for that year and his
first commercially available book since The the. (Toronto: Coach House,
1981). The latter was nominated for a Governor General's award. His most
recent book: The Centre (Caitlin, 1995); its last section, Arrythmia, also
won a prize, the bp Nichol Chapbook Award, 1994. Red Deer College Press
re-issued his 1975 (limited-edition) book, I Wanted to Say Something, in
1990. McKinnon lives in Prince George, BC, publishes broadsides and books
through his Gorse Street Press and teaches at the College of New
Caledonia.

Wayde Compton (Vancouver) is author of 49th Parallel Psalms (Vancouver:
Arsenal Pulp, 1999) and will be present. http://www.sfu.ca/~wcompton

George Elliott Clarke's recent book is the verse-play, Beatrice Chancy
(Victoria, BC: Polestar, 1999). The chapbook, Gold Indigoes, was published
by Carolina Wren Press in 2000. He lives in Toronto.

giovanni singleton's recent work can be found in Chain, Five Fingers
Review, and Kenning. The chapbook, mother/father, was published by
nocturnes editions in 1999. She lives in Berkeley.



** Thanks to the Kelly Writers House at the University of Pennsylvania,
for their continued support of PhillyTalks, and the University of Calgary
English Department and Cultural Diversity Institute as well as The Canada
Council for supporting #18 in particular - which is co-curated by Fred
Wah, who initiated their reading and made their event financially possible
to do as a "PhillyTalks" in Calgary.

While working on my poetry/poetics website I got a bright idea
that I have just now put into effect.  It was to put up a website
devoted to rejected letters-to-editors and to book reviews no one will
publish (because they're too long, too intelligent, too politically
incorrect, etc.).  SO!!!  If you want to review a book by some
celebrated poet you hate, here's your chance.  Anonymity is allowed!
Among its values, this site will allow people to be truthful
about poets without fear of loss of job or friends, etc.  Or
you can shamelessly push the work of someone you like, even
yourself.

Or pop off at the latest idiocy in Time Magazine, or on
the op ed page of your daily newspaper.

I've just started, so don't expect much for a while, but
do visit my site:

     http://www.geocities.com/comprepoetica/retort/index.html.

and use it to blast or praise someone!

Thought I'd repeat an invitation I made on this list when I was assembling
_The Gig_ #7.  At the back of most issues of _The Gig_ is a little
space-filling selection of notes & queries concerning contemporary
poetry--often identifications of allusions & sources, though sometimes other
kinds of useful or interesting information (e.g. in a note in #2 I noted
some instances of nuclear-weapons jargon in Prynne's _For the Monogram_). --
Anyway, here's an offer: anyone who sends in notes that I end up using for
the selection in the next issue (#8) gets a free copy of the magazine.
Contributors are credited (unless they ask otherwise).  I'll enclose below
the notes that appeared last time--they concern poems by John Riley, Susan
Howe, Andrew Crozier, Charles Olson, Paul Celan, Barrett Watten and JH
Prynne.  The slight UK slant reflects my own primary area of expertise,
though notes on contemporary poetry of any nationality are welcome.

N&Qs: John Riley's lines "To trace, round-eyed, the flight of birds" ("The
World Itself, the Long Poem Foundered") and "to get to know the flight of
birds" (Czargrad) are versions of a line from Trakl's "Helian."  The opening
stanza of Czargrad III translates a madrigal of Monteverdi setting the words
of Tasso ("Ecco mormorar l'onde...").  (Info courtesy Ian Patterson, Tim
Longville & Peter Riley.)

"There Are Not Leaves Enough to Crown to Cover to Crown to Cover," the
preface to Howe's Europe of Trusts, takes its title from Wallace Stevens'
"United Dames of America."

"As if it were a lamp of earthly flame" in Crozier's High Zero quotes
Shelley's Epipsychidion.  The title of All Where Each Is is from Olson's
"The Distances."  "Humiliation in Its Disguises" gets its title from Spicer'
s Language.

Olson's "These Days" may derive from the following sentence from Thomas
Wentworth Higginson's preface to the 1890 Poems of Emily Dickinson: "In many
cases these verses will seem to the reader like poetry torn up by the roots,
with rain and dew and earth still clinging to them, giving a freshness and a
fragrance not otherwise to be conveyed."  (Courtesy Ben Friedlander.)

The title of Celan's book Von Schwelle zu Schwelle alludes to his original
name, Antschel.  (Also from Ben Friedlander.)

"In Vietnam, / Hills skim only their crests" in Watten's Progress echoes a
passage in Prynne's "If There Is a Stationmaster at Stamford S.D. Hardly
 So."

The Latin in Prynne's "Of Movement Towards a Natural Place" is from Anselm's
Proslogion, ch.13.  In High Pink on Chrome "substance has no / contrary
among things that are" is from Aristotle's Physics (book 5, part 2); the
Latin near the poem's end is from Aquinas's Summa (IaIIae.19.6.c).  "The
King of Spain"'s German is from act 2 of Christian Dietrich Grabbe's
Hannibal.

        Dear Hilton,
                Don't you agree that there is enough
                agendas being pushed from all the myriad
                anthologies proliferating the book store ?
                I agree that every one should have their say,
                as far as poetry is concerned, but what disturbs
                me is the overcompensating political correctness
                that seem to be constantly jammed down the poetic
                readers throat with almost every tome issued from
                the big presses.

Lori, George Bowering, and other Canadians on the list:

In doing an anthology such as this, how do you handle questions of
multilingualism?  Are French (or, for that matter, Inuit) poems also
included?  Is the assumption that it would be monolingual -- and
would there be a separate French anthology?  Are there no "Canadian
pomo long poems" in French?  I am not trying to agitate separatist
nationalism, but I'm curious how this is thought through, especially
considering the strong sentiment in Quebec, and the
legal/political/cultural ways Canada is trying to deal with that
sentiment.  Although not officially bilingual, the same question
applies to similar anthologies in the US.  For example, do
anthologies include poems in Spanish, Chinese, etc., or when we say
"US poems" we mean, almost automatically, those in English and a
separate category (usually "multicultural") is set up for poems in
other languages (or, for that matter, even in English but from
"minority" ethnic groups)?  I'm not even sure of the virtues of such
multilingualism -- while I can read French or Spanish, I can't read
Chinese, and it would do me little good to have poems in Chinese (or
would this mean the necessity of accompanying translations)?  I'm
sure folks in Canada have had some experience dealing with these
questions and it would be enlightening to hear peoples' ideas.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

I know I'll probably just be accused of "name-dropping" (eh-hem) but =
here's the reading list for the April/May series I've curated at Double =
Happiness.  Chales Borkhuis and Sean Killian are doing February/March; I =
don't have their list here with me, otherwise I'd send it on.  I'll send =
announcements weekly as reminders.
Double Happiness is located at 173 Mott Street at Broome.  It's located =
below street level; there are a set of stairs next to the aquarium on =
the corner.  The readings are at 4, usually done by 6 or so.  The =
readings are during happy hour, which at DH is a two-for-one deal.

I think it will be a great series, and hope many of you make it out =
there.  I'm especially happy that Madeline Gins, who is better known as =
Arakawa's collaborator, agreed to read, and the combination of her and =
Christian Bok's sound poetry pyrotechnics should be lethal and =
memorable.  Redell Olsen is, as I write below, a great young poet from =
England who gave her first New York reading at the Zinc bar last year.  =
It was last minute and poorly attended but the few of us there felt =
quite lucky to know about it, and I think she will be a pleasant =
surprise for many.

Sally Silvers has, yes, published poetry and she works with text quite =
frequently in her dance pieces.  With Mac Wellman, whom many of you know =
as a playrwright but who is a great poet, I think it will be a great, =
unpredictable afternoon. =20

I think most of the other names below are sort of known to y'all.

I'm bringing in special lights for the series, too, done by my sister =
who is a light-designer and artist (she recently did work for Frank =
Gehry and is always on to something new).  So if anything it will be =
pretty there, and you plagurists can bring your notebooks and index =
cards.

Memorize this!  Hope to see you...

Brian

ONE FINAL REMINDER

POG

presents

writer Jackson Mac Low

Saturday, January 27, 7pm, Dinnerware Gallery, 135 East Congress
Admission: $5; Students $3

Jackson Mac Low is an internationally-acclaimed poet, composer, and writer
of performance pieces, essays, plays, and radio works, as well as a painter
and multimedia performance artist.  Author of twenty-six books, Mac Low was
recently awarded the prestigious Tanning Prize of the Academy of American
Poets; among many other awards he has also received a Guggenheim and an NEA.
Among his recent books are 42 Merzgedichte in Memoriam Kurt Schwitters
(1994) and Barnesbook (1995).  Reading co-sponsored by Chax Press.


In addition to his Saturday evening reading for POG and Chax, Jackson Mac
Low will also offer a two hour workshop on Sunday:

Making Poetry “Otherwise”: a Workshop with Jackson Mac Low
Sunday, January 28, 1-3, St. Philip’s in the Foothills (Vestry Room)
(NE corner of River and Campbell)
there is no charge to attend this workshop

Jackson  Mac Low is widely known for his experimental compositional methods.
His work makes various use of what he calls “deterministic procedures,”
often mixed with other writing modes to produce “liminal” works suggestive
of the threshold between the Unconscious and Consciousness.  This workshop
will offer participants the chance both to talk about such procedures—as
well as other ways of writing poems “otherwise”—and to try some out through
a variety of activities.

Workshop co-sponsored by The University of Arizona Extended University
Writing Works Center, The University of Arizona Poetry Center, The
University of Arizona English Department, and the journal Arizona Quarterly.

REMINDER

yet more POG....

on Monday, January 29--one day after Jackson Mac Low's workshop--POG and
Chax present

poet Hank Lazer

For the past twenty years, Hank Lazer has published poetry in many of
America's leading literary magazines and journals of experimental writing.
In 1992, he published Doublespace: Poems 1971-1989 (New York: Segue), a 192
page collection of poems written in several deliberately conflicting
styles. This book, which has received considerable attention, is unique in
American poetry and enacts essential conflicts within current American
literary culture. Also in 1992, Lazer published INTER(IR)RUPTIONS
(Generator Press), a series of ten collage-poems which incorporates a wide
range of layouts and materials, from baseball batting averages to critical
theory, from fashion and interior design columns to research in
neurophysiology. In 1994, Ink A! Press published a fine press limited
edition (including an audio cassette) of Negation, a series of ten poems.
Three of Ten, published in 1996 (Chax Press) is Lazer's largest collection
of poetry since Doublespace.

In May 1993, Lazer, along with poets Charles Bernstein and James Sherry,
published Language Poems (Sichuan Literature & Art Publishing House), a
bilingual (Chinese English) collection of poems, along with several essays
on contemporary American experimental poetry. In conjunction with the
publication of this book, Lazer travelled to China and gave readings,
lectures, and discussions in Chengdu, Beijing, Nanjing, and Suzhou as part
of a cultural exchange with Chinese poets, scholars, editors, and students.

In addition to his poetry, Lazer is a noted critic of modern and
contemporary poetry. For the past three decades, his writing on poetry has
appeared in leading literary journals. In 1996, Northwestern University
Press published Opposing Poetries, a two-volume collection of Lazer's
essays on the poetics and cultural politics of recent innovative American

the concreteness and materiality of the written word.=20

Hilton, no, I don't think multilingualism is 'handled' at all really, though
occasionally, as with this second edition of the New Long Poem anth.,
gestures are made to other ongoing traditions or poetics--I mean that in
this edition Sharon Thesen has included a Quebecoise poet, Yolande
Villemaire, in trans. of course, and this, she tells me, is significant.  I
do think, though, that English (language) colonialism is as alive and well
here in Canada as it is anywhere else, and if an anthology wishes to be
considered "major," adopted as course material etc., it necessarily should
be in English--official bilingualism or not, especially here in the west
where the necessity to learn French isn't as clear as it is in Ontario and
Quebec.  This isn't an attitude I personally advocate though!

All the best, Lori

Dear Richard and List,

I asked a somewhat naive question, a matter of curiosity about an
actual conflict, and I did not imply any political agenda.  But now
that you ask, I don't mind "all the myriad anthologies," although I
may not like all the poems.  I actually don't think there is a
species called "political correctness."  I have encountered dogmatic
narrow-mindedness, self-righteousness, puffery, prudery, bad taste,
and general idiocy -- most of that actually coming from the cultural
right wing but more than enough comes from the left.  George Bowering
gave a very informative answer about the situation in Canada -- and
it seems an interest in poetics can cut through the tensions about
language, and I suppose that should be encouraging.

As Caws states in her breathless introduction, the arts manifesto, =

first made its appearance in the late 19th century (about forty years =
after
the Communist Manifesto) relies on an arrogant, overblown stance that =
was a
"deliberate manipulation of the public view," as unquestioning about =
the
value of the "new art" and as it was about the bankruptcy of the old.
During what Caws calls the "Manifesto Moment," from about 1909 when the
Futurists first broke out to 1919 when Lyubov Popova wrote her =
"statement"
for non-objective Suprematist Art, the manifesto had a "madness about =
it,"
but always, even when positing an "us" against a "them," invited the =
reader
to become one of the new breed, a whole new way of looking at things =
from
just the other side of the paradigm-shift (a strategy and optimism that =
has
since been taken over by the technology industry).  The manifesto was =
not a
symptom of a world "waiting to be born," but was at once a diagnosis =
the its
narcolepsy and the crashing of speeding trains that would cure it =
forever.
In this anthology, Caws expands the definition of "Manifesto" to =
include
milder statements of principles (from the Language Poets), poems (parts =
of
Whitmans' "Song of Myself"), fragments from the writings of Cage, =
Duchamp
and others that are more seminal moments than statements, Oscar Wilde's
Preface to Dorian Gray, Poe's The Philosophy of Furniture, one of the =
few
writings of Jacque Vach=C8 (one of Breton's inspirations for =
Surrealism),
Schwitters offbeat "Cow Manifesto" and more.  Nitpickers, however, will =
note
certain important exclusions: Rimbaud's proto-Symbolist "Letter of the
Seer," in which many of the tenets of movements from Surrealism to Beat =
and
Language poetry were to be first found; the Brazilian concrete poets' =
"Pilot
Plan for Concrete Poetry," which was unique in mating a postcolonial =
agenda
with an aesthetics program for "exportable" art and is probably the =
only
South American manifesto that isn't either Symbolist or Surrealist in
origin; and Allen Ginsberg's "Howl," which if anything was the most =
concise,
most ecstatic and yet most complete expression of the mores and methods =
of
the Beat Generation.  Since the book contains visual as well as =
literary
manifestos -- writings from Odilon Redon and James Ensor, not to =
mention
Salvidor Dali's "Yellow Manifesto" -- an excerpt from Jan Tschichold's =
The
New Typography, which outlines the relationship of type and paper-size =
to
social consciousness, would have helped tie several strands together, =
such
as the included manifestos for new architecture and new music (relying =
on
experimental scores), not to mention the valuable, if not entirely
satisfying, Lettrist manifestos.  The Vorticism section is adequate, =
though
one misses Gautier-Brzeska's fabulous letter from the front, in which =
he
described carving a sculpture out of the butt of a gun, a more =
charismatic
piece than the Vorticist manifestoes themselves authored by the noxious
Richard Aldington (using Lewis and Pound's language; several of Lewis's
"Blast" pages are included, typefaces intact).  Readers of Language =
Poetry
will wonder why none of Bruce Andrews' famously propulsive essays are
included (recently collected in Andrews Paradise & Method from the
University of Alabama) nor "The New Sentence" by Ron Silliman, which =
more
than the writing of Nick Piombino and Michael Palmer satisfied several =
of
the classic aims of the manifesto and was very influential.  Since =
poetry
has been included, a short poem like Ashbery's "And 'Ut Pictora Poesis' =
Is
Her Name" would stand nicely beside O'Hara's "Personism" (which is =
included)
as a brief, provocative statement of the New York School's aesthetic
purposes that is both subverting of accepted literary values and -- =
perhaps
too warmly -- inviting.  Nonetheless, most of the classics are here,
including Whistler's "The Ten O'Clock," several essays by Apollinaire =
and
Marinetti, the Dada Manifestos by Tzara, the Russian Futurists' "Slap =
in the
Face of Public Taste," Pound's "A Few Don'ts by an Imagist," South =
American
manifestos by Borges and Huidibros, Olson's "Projective Verse," and
manifestoes of Negritude by Cesaire and others (yes, it's quite male =
heavy).
This enormous book is the great companion to the Rothenberg/Joris two =
volume
Poems for the Millennium, and in some ways a less fragmented portrait =
of
world (though not Asian) modernism.  Though the scholarship seems often
rather sketchy and quickly written -- Caws is like the Harold Bloom of =
this
material and doesn't often stop for reflection -- it is a challenging,
comprehensive read.

I sure hope someone can tell us what is said at a the symposium on
POETRY PLASTIQUE, moderated by marjorie perloff.  Sounds weird to
me.  How can anybody "move poetry off the page?"  Ten to one it's
just a bunch of people doing something new for the sake of doing
something new.

York, the Whitney Museum of American Art, Anthology Film Archives, the
London Filmmaker's Co-op, Eiszeit Kino, and the San Francisco
Cinematheque.

I have also translated and created English versions of several of the
films of Guy Debord, Ren=E9 Vi=E9net, and Gil Wollman. My work in media the=

has appeared in various museum catalogues as well as print and on-line
journals.

I investigate public images and private perceptions.

Video:

The Artwork in the Age of its Mechanical Reproducibility by Walter
Benjamin as told to Keith Sanborn _ 1936 Jayne Austen 1996 4 minutes.
Color and black & white. Stereo Hi-Fi sound

An attempt to problematize ownership and authorship in the age of digital
reproduction. Inspired by the Walter Benjamin essay of the same name and
the activities of the Situationists. If it could be authenticated that it
were produced in 1936, this would make it the oldest known digital video
work.

The Zapruder footage: an investigation of consensual hallucination 1999 20
minutes. Color. Stereo Hi-Fi sound

Various permutations and combinations of Abraham Zapruder's 8mm home movie
footage of the assassination of JFK. My work is intended as an
investigation of the footage as visual, experiential, and cultural
document. In the United States this footage is both notorious and
invisible; seldom actually seen, it is very well known; when seen, it
remains opaque. This work is intended to add a level of "transparency" to
original. It is set to Jajouka music in order to bring to the foreground
the ritual aspects of this visual, mechanical, and media historical event.

Mirror 1999 6 minutes. Color and black & white. Stereo Hi-Fi sound

An attempt to reach Joan of Arc in her final moments as she beholds the
beatific vision. To reach her, however, some anachronisms and a few
propositions about psychology, mysticism, and eroticism were necessary.

Semi-Private sub-Hegelian Panty Fantasy (with sound) 2001 4 minutes Black
and white and color. Stereo Hi-Fi sound.

The title says it all: Atomic exploding houses, Lenin's corpse, a molested
doll, remote control panty removal, half-alien children, brick walls and
several failed attempts at psychic repression and mind control. Guaranteed
to include a genuine quote from the Preface to Hegel's Phenomenology.

Dear George,

It's interesting that poetics or aesthetic notions can cross barriers
while nothing much else can -- perhaps a sign of optimism.
Interesting also that one side defines "Canada" and, for the most
part, accepts separation, while the other doesn't even try to bridge
the gap.   Alas, this is an instance in which poetry has little
control -- or in which a poetic genius could shake up the whole murky
swamp.

My very aged parents live in Hollywood, FLA, where the boardwalk
population (during the day) consists of elderly Jews and vacationers
from Quebec.  The languages are French and Yiddish or
Yiddish-inflected English, and they pass each other like ships in the
night.  Polite, but isolated from each other, but at least sharing
the boardwalk, two white minorities in bizarre Florida.  At night the
boardwalk tends to fill up with younger people listening to bands,
crowds which sometimes include more Cubans and other Latinos (but
almost no Haitians or other blacks).  I patiently wait for all Hell
to break loose.

Thanks for the clarification.

Lisa Jarnot on Allison Cobb:
With its exhilarating music at every turn, Allison Cobb's poetry invites you
to get ineluctably inebrious.  Add her to the Stream of Consciousness All
Star Team--this is a pitch you can't afford to miss.

Mark Wallace on __The Little Box Book__ by Allison Cobb:
With the spectre of Los Alamos, site of the first detonated atomic bomb,
lurking in the background, Allison Cobb's serial poem The Little Box Book
presents readers with a series of conundrums, winks, nods, sly misdirections,
and the pervasive possibility of social nightmares. These poems are about
desire, sex, misplaced love, the failure to understand and the pain of that
failure. There are layers here, spirals within spirals, and the frequent
surface lightness of the tone, the charming wit are both real but only part of
a story that's most powerful because it knows it can't all be told. Perfectly
clear, the words here locate themselves on the verge of the inarticulateness
which language can never more than partly dispel.

 block you will be on Atlantic Ave. Take a left on Atlantic, and about two
 and a half blocks down, between Third and Nevins, you will find the Flying

THE OLD SCHOOLHOUSE

Down in the valley, where the distant, faintly vengeful bleating of goats
can still be heard, stands the little red schoolhouse. I went to school
there, as did my parents before me. Not long ago, during a vacation from the
Schaumburg Embroidery Museum, I went back to visit it, and found no changes.

I remembered the swing under the cherry tree and how a girl's arm was broken
when she slipped and fell. I remembered just how it happened. And I
remembered how I was dismissed that day because I didn't clean up after my
dog. Poor old Brownie!

I even looked down into the cellar--that famous cellar where we tied up
Schuyler Bolt and then forgot to untie him until the next school year. What
trouble we got into that time!

I walked around the playground, where we had drank punch--a concoction of
grappa and various sticky vermouths, ornamented with an unidentified herb.
(“Edelweiss,” Dad suggested.) I found the place where we had cut our
names--in the bark of the antediluvian oak trees, on the great grinning
benches, and on the posts. We had cut hearts around the names, and arrows
through the hearts. This was an old-fashioned way of sending a valentine.

Many of those boys and girls are married or divorced now and may be sending
their children to this very school.



AIRPLANE

If you ever jump out of a plane, and your parachute doesn’t open, don’t
worry. Worry won’t get you anywhere.


RENT

My landlord was bothering me about the rent. He said he was coming over. As
he rang the doorbell, thousands upon thousands of black flies carrying elves
flew out and settled upon him. He hit at the flies and tried to kill them,
but the flies flew in great waves around him. Finally he turned and left. My
landlord later told me he thought I was crazy, but then, he had some growing
up to do.


THE ODD NEIGHBOR

Basically, there are three ways my neighbor and I are alike. The first is we
both like to repeat what other people say. The second is we both like seeds
a lot. The third is a beak.


SLEEPWALKER

If you ever see somebody sleepwalking, don’t wake them up, like a lot of
people do. Instead, that’s a good time to look through their stuff, because
I bet you’d be really surprised.



IF

If you were a space alien, you know what would be the one thing that would
really make you mad? Cookbooks written in French. How the heck are you
supposed to read them?


PERSONAL FASHION MISTAKES

1. Feather earring (1978)
2. Beret (1979)
3. Paper shirt (1981)
4. Green suede “Robin Hood” boots (1983)
5. Really skinny black belt (1985)
6. “Dress” black leather jacket (1989)
7. Stovepipe jeans (1990)
8. Flattop (1993)
9. Goatee (1997)
10. Feather earring (2000)




LIKE SAND...

Like sand in an hourglass, the loose granular material ran into the bottom
of the coffeemaker-shaped timepiece.



CURIOUS

To be curious about the greater world of the stars and planets is natural,
but trust me, why bother?

FOUND

One day I found a pea the size of a golf ball. The next day I found a golf
ball the size of a pea.


LAUGHTER

Laughter, according to  Reader’s Digest, is "the best medicine."


VALUES

Spend time taking stock of yourself and the values by which you live. Then
give me all your money.

MEDITATION

Meditation is about more than sitting at home in a dirty diaper.

JUNGLE LIFE

Tigers in the jungle are a very great danger to the natives who live near
by, but I don’t give them a second thought.

BRINGING THE NEWS

The old man was asleep when I reached his cabin in the woods with the
letter. Then I realized that what I had taken for the old man was really
just a half-opened cardboard box that contained some Styrofoam peanuts and a
color TV.

INCEST

I think incest is  wrong, because my relatives are ugly.

AS IT TURNS OUT

As it turns out they have relaxed the restrictions and I think your son
should reapply. Make sure he wears protective clothing since he will most
likely appear before one with a bird head, one with a rat head, and one with
the head of a snake.

Charles. I suppose there'll be a report on this. I cant get there obviously
(or not considering the speed of continental travel etc) but my question is
"What is plastique poetry?" Poetry that bends? Wrap around poetry. OK I
couldn't resist that but remember the theme of Umberto Eco's "The Name of
the Rose" which was  (its so long since I read it) basically that humour had
been supressed by the church hierarchy  and so on ....anyway the line up is
of writers who interest me -  even if they are currently "under attack" (who
isnt who has "succeeded" or whatever?)     -  because they are innovatory.
My guess is that it is poetry that "flows" across the boundaries: hence the
(my only?-probably not ) dictionary could be seen as a poem  idea.  Or a
play or whatever.  The things of the world as being a "poem" by virtue of
the world-view of the observor. The idea that the poem is never finished,
process: the rejection of the "perfect" poem. The opening up.  "rejection of
closure " etc.  But it  sounds like       an opportunity to "get serious"
(not humourless) and include some of your critics  if they want  to be so
included  despite their "agressive" way of attacking (after all its a case
of "sticks and stones"). I think there is a general feeling that Langpo and
its derivatives is somehow anti-human or anti-lyrical or "too intellectual"
or not "real" etc. Perhaps people are becoming anxious in the shadow of
certain political and scientific events (or because of the power of the
media we feel more responsible and perhaps stupidly "guilty" about living so
well in the West etc But I think that this leads to ideas of supression as
much as freedom: possibly could lead back to  the equally "dangerous"
social realism...  and  because there's a lot of homeless  and poor  and
otherwise    extremely           disadvantaged people  throughout the world,
people who are very sensitive sometimes confuse their social obligations,
and feel they should throw out anything "abstract" or "difficult" or
"obscure" as if that would help anyone.(Or they confuse the personalities of
_some_ artists or poets etc with_all_ who are in a certain "movement".)
which is not unnatural but we need to realise how history has always
challenged us with moral and ethical imperatives: we  can get excessively
into "The Justice Trap", which can lead to cynicism and negation or even
nihilism,  as much as passionate embracement of "Art" or "Science". Neither
of these are good or bad per se..in fact its probably good to see "passion"
in regard to poetry (and other arts however they are defined)....
  When I visited N.Y. (Manhatten really) one of the first poet's I
encountered expressed the view:"But I dont like Language Poetry". Iwas new
to Langpo and quite interested in it (still am of course) but I side-stepped
that by expressing my admiration of Ashbery by which I gained approval. I
should have "stuck to my guns" and said: "But Language Poetry I find very
interesting."  And so on....it's quite irrational but I wrote some
"abstract" poems and one or two about the homeless etc  that were
"realistic".  For the wrong reasons.. a kind of "guilt". But if I think
about it nowadays: why not vary one's style (apart from how one "feels"
about how one communicates or creats etc) so that one "does" a "realist"
poem then a structural thing or whatever? But the poet (or poets) are and
have been seen to be the tohunga (Maori vaguely translates as priest) of
culture. This can  lead to the over mysticistication or mythication or
romantisisation of the poet. Altho maybe it helps to write well if one puts
oneself in a "charged" frame of mind: however...by lots of coffee or some
drug (can be dangerous) or music or out walking or being in love or
whatever. Doesnt hurt. A little bit of romantic and random dashed into the
psychic creative brew with a large mixture of "intellectual" offset by a
dash of humour and lots of openness.
   Some thoughts generated by the symposium's title. Maybe someone (not
exactly anti) but who is more or less indifferent to Langpo etc should give
their view of the event as well as your last more "direct" critics and
someone who is an "enthusiast"... so we get a broader view of the meeting. I
know it may well go onto one of the mags like John Tranter's but something
on the list like that with various views would possibly engender some
interesting debate and discussion about poetry and as it relates to the
symposium.  Regards, Richard Taylor.

Subject:      The battlefield where the moon says I love you

I just noticed that Frank Stanford's _The battlefield where the moon says I
love you_ is on SPD's home page as one of its featured books. I think it's
one of the finest longpoems of the past century (15,283 lines over 383 pages
and no stanza breaks) -- it was originally published in 1977 -- and it's one
of the most unique pieces of writing you are ever likely to find. Stanford
(whom I never met and who committed suicide in '78) wrote most of this work
as a teenager in the deep south and it's an authentic instance of "swamp
surrealism" (a genre of which it may be sole example). I first discovered it
in a fairly primitively printed first edition in Modern Times bookstore in
San Francisco (back when it was on Sanchez Street) but didn't actually buy
the damn thing until I read a rave review of it by Lorenzo Thomas in, of all
places, Monthly Review. Stanford's later poetry really has always struck me
as an attempt to contain the brilliant and over-the-top impulses that are
given free reign here, so if you know those books, you still have no clue
about this one.

This was, I believe, the very first book that Lost Roads ever published and
now they've brought it back in a fabulous new edition. I'm rereading it as I
write and it really stands up over two decades later. CD Wright & co. are to
be congratulated for making such an essential work more widely available.

So, bottom line, buy this book,

Small Press Traffic Literary Arts Center presents

Friday, February 9, 2000 at 7:30 pm

SESSHU FOSTER & MICHELLE MURPHY


SESSHU FOSTER makes his debut appearance at Small Press Traffic, bringing
with him the revolutionary kite of fragmented fireworks we saw first
exhibited in his 1987 book of poems Angry Days. Foster was co-editor of
Invocation L.A.: Urban Multicultural Poetry, winner of a 1990 American
Book Award.  He lives in Alhambra and teaches composition and literature
in East L.A., where he grew up.  Of several books he's written about that
locale, the most recent is CITY TERRACE FIELD MANUAL (Kaya Press). Foster
is currently writing a novel which incorporates photographs of Mexico in
the 1940s. Come on down and get a taste of his startling and exciting
methods.

MICHELLE MURPHY's writing teeters into that satisfying and necessary place
of hybridity which works the angles of poetry and prose. She writes: "No
single vocabulary can worry us into revealing the weight of summer rain
over a sentence, vowels riddled with dusk's blue shade." A lifelong San
Franciscan who "learned poetry at City Lights", Murphy is the author of
Jackknife & Light (Avec Books, 1998), which was shortlisted for the Pen
West Award. Her work has appeared in journals all over the world,
including Russia and Japan. Recently she's been working on a new
manuscript of poetry as well as translating the Russian poet Alexander
Ulanov.  Her translations of his work appear in Crossing Centuries: The
New Wave in Russian Poetry (Talisman, 2000).

A painter friend of mine (Deirdre Simon---mark the name, unless of course the

of essays/reviews; I think the publisher may be convinced to go 4-color...)

out of tune, enough for Joe "Scud Mountain Boys," Pernice to interrupt, with
joy,
one of Tate's workshop---ah, the mass of memories thank God for the U)

and in this magazine, which I've only begun reading is a new (prosey) poem by
Bob Perelman called "A Practical Poem." Bob's still writing great things,
and Brenda Borofsky told me that he read more of them at a reading she did
with them (or him) in Fuchs' Filly series....

If you have the opportunity, do not miss the recently completed trilogy of
films by extraordinary San Francisco filmmaker Nathaniel Dorsky.  I was
lucky to see a private screening of Arbor Vitae in December-- his films are
extremely beautiful, uniquely conceived and executed works.  Dorsky is the
true poet of the film medium, and --as if despite his films' silence-- a
brilliant speaker regarding his art.  San Francisco Cinematheque presents
the first screening (Monday, Feb 5, SF Art Institute), with a repeat of the
program in Berkeley at PFA (Tuesday, Feb 13, 7:30, 2575 Bancroft Way).

NATHANIEL DORSKY's Arbor Vitae, Triste and Variations

Nathaniel Dorsky In Person

Throughout his career, Nathaniel Dorsky has made personal poetic films
composed of images gathered in the course of his daily life.  A profound
use of silence accompanies exquisite photography and meticulous editing to
raise Dorsky's cinematic language to an ecstatic pitch.  Arbor Vitae,
Dorsky's conclusion to a trilogy that included Triste and Variations, was
recently premiered at the New York Film Festival's Views from The
Avant-Garde series.

Tonight's screening will mark Arbor Vitae's West Coast premiere, as well as
the first time the trilogy has been screened in its entirety.

"Arbor Vitae is a gesture towards a cinema of pure being. . . . the
underlying motivation is the delicate revelation of the transparency of
presence, our tender mystery amidst the elaborate unfolding of the tree of
life."  (N. Dorsky)

"Whether the images are lush, viscous pools of black liquid or reflections
of light moving across a window curtain, they end up being, don't ask me
how, magnificent metaphors for existence.  Even braver is the refusal of
undercutting ironies.  No more convincing argument could be made for the
continuing, glorious necessity of film. . . ."  (Phillip Lopate, Film
Comment)

". . . a sequence of exquisitely observed images of vanishing moments in a
world of motion.  Much of these films' power lies in their silence.  They
remind us that the process of quietly observing the world without trying to
articulate our perceptions can be a rarefied state of being, that silence
is often sacred."  (Stephen Holden, NY Times)

member of the poetry circles around the late Jack Spicer and the North
Beach bohemian scene during the 1960s, Mr. Stanley had his early books
published here by the legendary White Rabbit Press.  Some of his finest
later poems are centered on his personal and family history in San
=46rancisco.  His amazing long poem "San Francisco's Gone" (in the recent
book Gentle Northern Summer) is the most remarkable San Francisco poem to
appear within anyone's recent memory.  Since 1970 George Stanley has made
his home in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he teaches at Capilano
College.  His recent books, published by New Star Books of Vancouver,
include the brilliant volume Gentle Northern Summer and, just out, that
book's equally compelling successor, At Andy's.

SHARON THESEN is one of Canada's more prominent poets and editors.  Recent
projects include her edition of The New Long Poem Anthology (Coach House
Press, Toronto; new edition forthcoming from Talonbooks), and, co-edited
with scholar Ralph Maud, the incredibly illuminating correspondence between
the remarkable writer Frances Boldereff and the late great poet Charles
Olson-- Charles Olson and Frances Boldereff:  A Modern Correspondence
(Wesleyan University Press, 1999).  Ms. Thesen's books of poetry include
Artemis Hates Romance, Aurora (both from Coach House), News and Smoke
(Talonbooks, 1999) and, most recent, A Pair of Scissors (Anansi, 2000).
She too teaches at Capilano College in Vancouver.

VERACRUZ


In Veracruz, city of breezes & sailors & loud birds,
an old man, I walked the Malec=F3n by the sea,

and I thought of my father, who when a young man
had walked the Malec=F3n in Havana, dreaming of Brazil,

and I wished he had gone to Brazil
& learned magic,

and I wished my father had come back to San Francisco
armed with Brazilian magic, & that he had married
not my mother, but her brother, whom he truly loved.

I wish my father had, like Tiresias, changed himself into a woman,
& that he had been impregnated by my uncle, & given birth to me as a girl.

I wish that I had grown up in San Francisco as a girl,
a tall, serious girl,

& that eventually I had come to Veracruz,
& walking on the Malec=F3n, I had met a sailor,
a Mexican sailor or a sailor from some other country--
        maybe a Brazilian sailor,
& that he had married me, & I had become pregnant by him,
so that I could give birth at last to my son--the boy I love.

about George Stanley:
"The reality that Stanley experiences is so demanding that the poems
simultaneously track the experience of the world he's in, the startling
play of his mind, and his recurrent, shifting insights about language,
which is inseparable from the world."

about Sharon Thesen:
"The scissors of the title snip through unexpected corners of the world.
Like Stanley's, Thesen's poems are animated by an unusually powerful
intelligence.  They typically begin with a mundane moment . . . but before
even a brief poem is over, it cuts into the often ominous, quirky, reality
below. . . .  Thesen's poems are insistently in the same world as the rest
of us."
