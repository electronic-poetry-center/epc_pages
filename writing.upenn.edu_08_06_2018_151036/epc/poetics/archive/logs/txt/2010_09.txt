Suggest check out the current section of Jacket on the work of Ron Silliman.
Tim Yu's eye on Ketjak and Tjanting are genuinely critical and illuminating re Lang Po politics et al, including edgy issues of race & class.
Personally I find Yu's work as one of the smarter kettles currently percolating on the stove.

IMRAM, a national literary festival in Ireland, in association with
the Dublin City Arts Centre and T=EDAitreo, will present "The Prairie
Gaeltacht" by S=E9amas Cain.  Performances will begin at 7:00 p.m. on
Monday and Tuesday, September 20 and 21, 2010 at CITY ARTS, 15
Bachelor=92s Walk, Dublin 1, Ireland.

Describing the script for The Prairie Gaeltacht, Liam Carson, director
of the IMRAM Festival, said "poetic, beautiful, moving, simple,
evocative.  I'm really looking forward to experiencing the
performance."

And the Irish writer Gabriel Rosenstock described the script as "very movin=
g."

THE PRAIRIE GAELTACHT

"I remember herds of buffalo on the prairie, beautiful Indian ponies
... the coyotes howling at dusk."  So speaks one voice in S=E9amas
Cain=92s dramatic evocation of what he calls The Prairie Gaeltacht.

Drawing on his own conversations with relatives, S=E9amas Cain=92s
narrative probes deep into family, land and language.  Through their
plain but poetic voices, history is relived.  Here Irish settlers
learn from Indians "where strawberries grew and which birds were most
delicious to hunt."  Here is Thomas Burke, kinsman of Edmund, fleeing
to the Irish Colonies of Minnesota in 1878.  We are brought from the
time of the wagon trains to the day electricity arrived in the village
of Murdock in 1922.  Along the way we hear stories of the Molly
Maguires, the communitarian Connemaras and their vision of creating a
Gaelic socialist utopia on the prairies of western Minnesota; of
fiddlers and harmonica players at dances; of droughts, crop failures,
snowstorms, and swarms of locusts.

The Prairie Gaeltacht is an extraordinary bi-lingual journey into a
haunting past.  Actors from T=EDAitreo will re-create in Irish the words
and stories of S=E9amas Cain=92s grandparents and their cousins and
friends, whilst Cain himself will narrate in English.

A unique insight into an almost forgotten history, The Prairie
Gaeltacht is a deeply personal odyssey from one of America=92s most
radical and inventive of poets.

	Stephen Harpers Shoes


	Long days holding up the country,
	short nights breathing fresh air.
	Each morning, a minion polishes away
	a days accumulated scuffs
	with matt black petroleum paste.
	My burnished upper reflects the blurred image
	of the face above but does not shine.
	My heel grinds even the iridescent
	beetle, silent, powerless, beautiful,
	Into the Langevin asphalt. My steel
	shank would never pass security
	if the face did not control it personally.
	The feet have no particular smell,
	like winter air or snow. I complain
	of the unguents, salves and balms, reeking of sulphur
	that, despite all evidence to the contrary, will not
	relieve the cracked and callused heels.

going completely mad. Stephen recently moved to the charming Ottawa

seventeen seconds: a journal of poetry and poetics comes out as the
natural extension of the eight issues of Poetics.ca edited by rob mclennan
and Stephen Brockwell. Highlighting the diversity of voice, style,
practice and politic, seventeen seconds continues the resolve to provide a
forum for dialogue on contemporary poetics, with a focus on Canadian
writing. Over the past two decades, the amount of critical writing
published in print literary journals on Canadian poetry, specifically,
seems to have decreased dramatically, but slowly returned through a number
of online journals. seventeen seconds simply wishes to help strengthen the
dialogue and the ongoing conversation about writing through publishing new
writing, and conversation about new writing. How else are we supposed to
learn anything, unless we keep talking?

Feedback and submission queries are most welcome.

EMERGENCY FEELING presents
Rachel Blau DuPlessis
& a draft [beer] party
celebrating Pitch: Drafts 77-95 (Salt)
(co-sponsored by Whenever We Feel Like It & Emergency)

Saturday, September 11, 4pm
Jose Pistolas
263 S 15th St, Philadelphia
http://www.josepistolas.com/
RACHEL BLAU DUPLESSIS is an American poet-critic whose on-going long poem
project, begun in 1986, is collected here in Torques: Drafts 58-76, as well as
in Drafts 1-38, Toll (Wesleyan U.P., 2001) , Drafts 39-57, Pledge, with Draft
unnnumbered: Precis (Salt Publishing, 2004) and Pitch: Drafts 77-95 (Salt
Publishing, 2010). DuPlessis was awarded a residency at Bellagio in 2007; she
was the recipient of a Pew Fellowship for Artists and of the Roy Harvey Pearce/
Archive for New Poetry Prize, both in 2002.

EMERGENCY is designed to address several questions we see arising in
contemporary North American poetry around issues of emergence and literary
community. We've created an ongoing dialogue among working poets on how they
think about poetic lineage, theoretical stances, and aesthetic practice.
Emergency is curated by Julia Bloch and Sarah Dowling.
http://emergency-reading.blogspot.com/

WHENEVER WE FEEL LIKE IT is put on by Committee of Vigilance members Emily
Pettit and Michelle Taransky. The Committee of Vigilance is a subdivision of
Sleepy Lemur Quality Enterprises, which is the production division of The
Meeteetzee Institute.

  If you scroll down to the bottom of either my web page
(http://jonathanmorse.net) or my blog
(http://jonathan-morse.blogspot.com) you should see a tasteful fake-wood
bookshelf bearing two little click-to-open picture books by me. This
comes from an online vanity press called issuu.com. It does words as
well as pictures, and unlike other vanity presses it's free.

Anything there to interest you? I've set it not to allow downloads of my
books, but if you'd like to give away printouts, that can be done.

Looking for creative works/projects in community. Creating a line of study,
here. Please send all suggestions my way. Examples include: Kaia Sand's Portland

and I would like to dedicate this to a man (okay, I'll NOT embarrass
him and not mention his name) who recently said to me, "MARIANNE MOORE
WAS THE MODERNIST WOMAN POET!"  when I mentioned how much Mina Loy's
poems mean to my life, and then I said in response to him, "Ah, well,
I didn't realize there should only be one.  But yet you mention ALL
THESE MEN!"  HAHAHA!  To YOU, sir, and YOU know exactly who you are.
Hope you're learning shame.

but for the love of Mina!
the splendor of all that is Mina!

Yes, wonderful language & loving reproach, CA. Not forgetting Laura
Riding, and multiplications of names always please. & though I was
also at the Home & Away conference, Michael, I didn't hear the Pound,
maybe had different earphones in my head hearing different
translations. Or perhaps you mean the 2nd conference you then went to:
were they really Pounding, there? Makes one worry even more about the
Australian leadership vacuum. Fondly, Lisa

Look at what the DAstrugistenDA collective has done and does.

Here some more info about several DAstrugistenDA performances

DAstrugistenDA



*1. DAstrugistenDA:*



The international poetic collective "DAstrugistenDA" was formed
spontaneously in the Macedonian city of Struga in August of 2005. In this
city every year a world famous poetry festival (the Struga Poetry Evenings)
is organised.

Peter Waugh (GBR), Philip Meersman (BEL) and Sergey Biryukov (RUS) had a
poetic encounter. All three are working in different fields and with
experimental forms of poetry - sound, visual, video, etc. Their efforts and
styles were rapidly combined and were shown in Struga and other cities of
Macedonia during several groundbreaking performances. In the process of
working together the name of the group was born, in which markedly the plac=
e
of their first encounter (Struga) is given a prominent place together with
the cut-up name of that direction in art which is very dear to all three of
them: Dada=C3=AFsm. Lieven Vercauteren (BEL) applied later by writing an
application poem, he was promptly accepted.



Their unique way of collaborating, improvising and performing arrangements
of each others poems can be seen as a fresh and new form of collaborative
poetry.



*2. Projects by DAstrugistenDA*

*1. "Echo in the tower", installation drafts, Kaliningrad, 2005. *

DAstrugistenDA proposed to create an enlightened soundscape around the
Kaliningrad tower. In front of the tower and on its walls a sound
performance would take place: 3 poets based on the works of I. Kant and H.
Arendt.

This installation drafts were created for the "Tower Kronprinz: Second
Advent" 2006 competition for the Kaliningrad Branch of the National Center
for Contemporary Arts

*2. Guerrilla Reading, Brussels, 2006*

During the opening of the group exhibition of Mario Villaggi in Saint-Josse
in 2006, Peter Waugh took the train from Vienna to Brussels to join the
DAstrugistenDA members to hold a Guerrilla Reading. Unplanned, the members,
dazzled the audience with multilingual improvisation and pure poetry. After
their 1 hour reading all DAstrugistenDA members went home.

*3. DAstrugistenDA: Bar none: 48h poetry reading behind bars, Brussels, 200=
7
*

DAstrugistenDA performed 48h continuously poetry, caged at Beursschouwburg
in Brussels wearing orange overalls at the BRXLBRAVO 2007 festival. Because
artists all over the world are still being barred from public life, are
being prosecuted, jailed, killed=E2=80=A6 because of what they write or say=
.

No-one should be prosecuted, jailed, killed because of his/her opinion or
words.

This project is an idea that resulted from discussions between Sergej
Birjukov and Philip Meersman.

*4. Po=C3=ABpera in one act, Berlin, 2009*

During the 1st European Poetry Slam Days in 2009 in Berlin, DAstrugistenDA
made a multilingual tribute to the Avant Garde, Zaum, DaDa en Surreal
Movements in poetry. This time they made a collaborative arrangement of
their poems and created a whole po=C3=ABpera in one act especially for this
event.



*5. BUTFF, Breda, 2010*

During the BUT film festival in Breda, the DastrugistenDA will do 3
different poetry interventions.

*a. Angst und Sprache, a search for voices and sounds as reactions to
traumatic events.*

Different historical events still keep people wandering about what they
might do or should do or have to do when similar events do happen in their
neighbourhood, family, daily environment. 9/11 was one of these historical
events. But also the atrocities that happened in Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfour=E2=
=80=A6
But also the floods in Pakistan, the Oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, in
the Niger delta=E2=80=A6 No one responds to the screams, giving the wrongdo=
er plenty
of time to do wrong. Bystanders are distressed but feel too ill-equipped to
respond, and there is an insufficiency in assigning responsibility - a
"diffusion of responsibility". DastrugistenDA asks the question what we,
international poets and sound artists would do or could do to make people
understand or even better, to make them notice, recognise the emergency and
to let them decide to act on it.

*b. Box ring.*

Poetry talks will be held twice in a Box ring. Together the DastrugistenDA
will be negotiating words, phrases and sounds into a time =E2=80=93 locatio=
n based
performance.

The courtyard, the ring, the audience are all parts in a play, all decorum
and no content. Or are the words the decorum and the audience the deus ex
machina to rescue the world from its images?

Twice the games will be opened twice talks will start. The ultimate questio=
n
remains: will these talks bring results, a solution, a better understanding=
,
a sound result or will they be only sounds and fury, a perpetuum mobile of
syllables ringing hollow, a poem written on a piece of paper while holding
the ring?

*c) Breakfast & BUTFF. The Day After*

DAstrugistenDA makes a multilingual tribute to the Avant Garde, Zaum, DaDa
en Surreal Movements in poetry. In a collaborative arrangement of their
poems, DastrugistenDA will wake up people over coffee and croissants to the
sounds of language. What happens The Day After? Nobody knows, yet.



*6. White Breakfast @ Beursschouwburg *

*(not accepted because of too political)*



In 2007 the DAstrugistenDA imprisoned themselves at Beursschouwburg in
orange overalls to support freedom of speech and the closure of GITMO.

In 2010 GITMO is still open and people are still being tortured, imprisoned
or executed because of their opinion, words, texts, art.

During the breakfast at the end of the White Night 2010, the DAstrugistenDA
will perform in white overalls above, in front and amongst the audience
taking breakfast in honour of:

   - the birthdays of Mahatma Ghandi (October 2nd) (Nobel peace prize
   winner), Carl von Ossietzky (Nobel peace prize winner), Sergei
   Aleksandrovich Yesenin (poet), Gerardo Diego (poet), Louis Aragon (poet)=
;
   - the deaths of William Morris (poet) and Gustav Stresemann (Nobel peace
   prize winner);
   - the last public sighting of Edgar Allen Poe;
   - the foundation of The Truth;
   - the independence in 1932 of Iraq from Great Britain;
   - the German reunion of 1990;
   - the ruling of the fact that Allen Ginsberg's Howl and Other Poems were
   not obscene;
   - the Adoption of =E2=80=9CSOS=E2=80=9D in 1906 as THE international dis=
tress signal and
   - the morning after the International Day of Non-Violence

with sound-, word- and performance poetry.

They will perform there own poetry, new instant collaboratively created wor=
k
and poetry (un)known poets from all around the world and more in particular
the writings of the people who=E2=80=99re honoured by the DAstrugistenDA.

They hope that with their performance they will help bring peace and
understanding without violence, with sounds and words.

*Sergej Birjukov* was born in 1950, Sergej Birjukov is a poet, philologist,
sound-poet, performance artist, and researcher of the Avant-Garde who works
in the Martin Luther University in Halle, Germany. Birjukov has written
several books of his own poetry and art-research. He has realized
performances in Russia, Germany, Ukraine, Estonia, Poland, Finland, Canada,
Netherlands, Serbia, and has participated in international exhibitions of
visual poetry. His poetry is translated into German, Italian, Japan,
English, Spanish, French languages. Birjokov was awarded the Diploma Number
One from the Institute of history of Russian Avant-Garde for his work on

Since 1984 *Fjorton* (=C2=B01966, Belgium) has been active in the fields of
theatre, poetry, prose, psychology, plastic arts, the body, mindfulness and
spirituality. His endeavours in these 'arts' were (more or less frantic)
fights to keep on digging in the well of his own creativity, sometimes
connecting his doing with the doings of other people. As an actor
Fjortonplayed parts in about 17 plays, most (but not all) of them for
children. As
a director-playwright he creates original plays and transcribes known plays
from e.g. Pinter. Lieven published in the capacity as poet-writer-publisher
4 collections of poems: Blue Valentines (1989), Decado (1991), Een kwart
eeuw kinds (A quarter of a century childlike, 1993) and Haram (1994).
Together with Philip Meersman he wrote, staged and played Flight 39.1 in
1996 and the project (compilation) "de min" in 2003. On behalf of the
tsunami 12-12 foundation he contributed to "Woordenvloed". Within the
Flemish art collective "JA" Fjorton works together with Philip Meersman on
"Oh & Zie" and other projects. He has written several stories for children.
Nowadays he enjoys more word-oriented settings: poetry, poetry of sounds,
music and images. Alone and with others.

What the Critics Say....

When I had read this story, I was filled with awe. I could not remain
in my room and went out of doors. I felt as if I were locked up in a
ward too. =97 Nikolai Lenin

A master of understatement, of concealed meaning, of twilight scenes
and of prose as compressed as poetry, whose heroes don't want what
they want? =97 Andrei Voznesensky

If you don't already have a copy in each of your toilets, then this
ought to persuade you. =97 Foodtripper

"Go along and be amused, amazed and transported" =97 Clive Barnes, New York=
 Post

He was looked upon by those who believed in him as the greatest
revolutionist in the history of contemporary literature, and by those
who scoffed as the perpetrator of a gigantic literary hoax. As it
happens, neither of the two opinions is wholly correct. His
"revolution" resembles a literary putsch, and if his writing is "a
hoax" nevertheless she earnestly believes in it. =97 Michael Gold, The
New Masses

Pay no attention to what the critics say... Remember, a statue has
never been set up in honor of a critic! =97 Jean Sibelius

We are pleased to announce and make available the first Full Metal Poem =
magazine. FMP is our irreverent new Magazine edited from Amsterdam and =
Hamburg and filled with Poetry Art Photography.

http://www.fullmetalpoem.com

It's a beautiful numbered edition of 250 - around 100 pages with =
stencil-printing and a wrap-around handbound jacket.

After almost two years of work, we're pleased at how it turned out, =
please click here to take a look:

http://fullmetalpoem.com/images.html

Working backwards from A Secret Location on the Lower East Side, we =
paged through all the old mags we could get our hands on for design and =
put together a list of writers we like who are still writing and some =
who are no longer among us, we also brought in some new writers:=20

Bob Arnold / John Bennett / Noel Black / Rolf Dieter Brinkmann / Thomas =
A Clark / Jack Collom / Cid Corman / Simon Cutts / Stephen Delbos / =
Amanda Deutch / Oliver Dunne / Gerald Hausman / Kent Johnson / Joanne =
Kyger / Louise Landes Levi / Marie T. Martin / Gui Mayo / Chris McCabe / =
David Miller / Clark Morgan / F.A. Nettelbeck / Kevin Opstedal / Ron =
Padgett / Francis Poole / Silke Scheuermann / Harris Schiff / Pete =
Simonelli / Will Skinker / Tom Snyder / Brian Unger / John Wieners / =
Lucien Zell / John Casey / Peter Dejong / Eliza Newman-Saul



Because postage is so ridiculous at the moment - about $7 to mail a copy =
from europe, we brought a box of 20 copies to SF and will mail them from =

IMRAM, a national literary festival in Ireland, in association with
the Dublin City Arts Centre, will present "tr=EDd an gcoill" by S=E9amas
Cain and Slavek Kwi.  This Installation with recorded or live
performances will take place at 1:00 p.m. to 5:45 p.m. from September
23 through September 27, 2010 at the Grapevine Space of CITY ARTS, 15
Bachelor=92s Walk, Dublin 1, Ireland.

For additional information phone
Nick Reilly at CITY ARTS, i.e.,

Phone (+353)(1)902.2414 ...

http://www.cityarts.ie/events/2010/09/23/-trid-an-gcoill

tr=EDd an gcoill
"through the woods"

A collection of reality-particles; sounds and images from Dromore
Woods.  An audiovisual installation, with recorded or live
performances.

tr=EDd an gcoill, a 120-page poem by S=E9amas Cain, is itself a poetic
field recording.  It evokes a walk through Dromore Woods in County
Clare.  It immerses the reader in a stream of words and word-clusters.
 The overall effect is hypnotic, as we are led by a piped piper into
the heart of the wood.

Czech sound-artist Slavek Kwi has created an audiovisual installation
from underwater and field recordings captured in Dromore Woods itself,
and fused these elements with S=E9amas Cain's chanted recital of tr=EDd an
gcoill.  This installation with performances will be open to the
public in City Arts, with Free Admission.  tr=EDd an gcoill creates a
unique space in which one can experience nature and language through
sounds and visions of uncanny beauty.

S=E9amas Cain is an Irish-American experimental poet, a friend and
colleague of Jean Genet and Allen Ginsberg.  One of the most radical
voices in modern literature he writes in Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Old
Celtic, Spanish and English.

For additional information, go to ...

http://seamascain-writernetwork.org

Slavek Kwi is a Czech sound-artist, composer and researcher. From the
early nineties he has operated under the name "Artificial Memory
Trace."

For additional information, go to ...

http://www.artificialmemorytrace.com

Seamus Johnson described Cain's recorded chantings of tr=EDd an gcoill
for this Installation as "incantatory, rhythmic, passionate, guttural,
mezmerizing.  Cain is the baritone ascending to Apollo.  Or, is he the
baritone ascending Mt. Carmel?  He does tend to get carried away in
performance, lost in a kind of trance, at times in the passion of the
moment whacking the microphones.  Indeed, Cain's performance is
hypnotic!  Plenty of auditory images!  And plenty of rich and diverse
sounds to be chopped up for computer-randomization!"

Slavek Kwi used chance operations to distribute the fragments of
Cain's chantings in various speakers of a vertical Speaker Tree, which
doesn't brake the continuous chanting, but changes the architecture as
texture and dynamics.  Also, Kwi used chance operations on the
distribution in speakers of the timbre of Cain's chantings.

Kwi's Installation includes a color film, with parts of the text of
the tr=EDd an gcoill poem superimposed in scrolling effect over images
from Dromore Woods, a slide-show with 1,500 slides, an environmental
soundtrack on external 5.1 system and also a Voice Tower, all edited
using chance operations.  Kwi's Installation also includes physical
objects from Dromore Woods.

In my opinion, Niedecker is amazing. She toiled away in the backwoods of Mi=
chigan. I love her poetry. I also find Loy and Stein fascinating. But there=
 is something heroic about Niedecker...

Why have the Tragically Hip made it in Canada but not in the USA?

Hi Lisa,

It was at the second event. However, the names of Stein and Niedecker (and =
many
others) were also brought up - I referred to all three in varying contexts.=
 My
reference to Pound was shading to negative, a noting regarding Chinese poet=
ry. It
would have been foolish for me not to note that historical case. And Pound'=
s name
was used with some very negative connotations as well. But, yes, the name w=
as there.

We seem to have a government here as of today (it seems to have become a
'paradigm' rather than a 'government'). Whether we have any leaders is a fa=
ir point.

And thanks, CA, for the portal. Fabulous.

Cheers,
Jill

Read Mark Scroggins=B9 excellent bio of Louis Zukofsky (2007). It weaves his
life & his work together, just as Z himself did. It is straightforward,
endlessly informative, clear, full of tidbits about & deep connections to
other poets, discussions of objectivism, and an ending including people we
know, esp LangPos & Z=B9s influence on them, as well as summaries of his
contributions to postmodern poetry. Celia=B9s music. Not to mention a feel fo=
r
NY at the time. And Jewishness. And Pound & Williams, as well as Creeley=B9s
surprise that Z considered him one of his best friends. Ya never know.

 =93My Favorite Banned Books Abecedarian Read-Out=94 is happening on =
Saturday,
October 2, in celebration of the 2010 Banned Books Week. We will begin =
with
A and end with Z: participants will start by reading excerpts from books
whose titles / authors whose names begin with the letter A (such as As I =
Lay
Dying by William Faulkner) and end with the letter Z (such as Their Eyes
Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston). The Abecedarian was chosen as =
a
way of structuring the event because it is a systematic way of having =
the
event progress, and to highlight the fact that banned and challenged =
books
exist throughout the alphabet, across the spectrum of creative =
expression
and cultural life. Participants will include: Vittorio Carli, Dan =
Cleary,
Elizabeth Harper, Jeffrey Helgeson, Wayne Allen Jones, Jamie Kazay, =
Katrina
Kemble, Shelley Nation-Watson, Charlie Newman, Cathleen
Schandelmeier-Bartels, Arlene Walters, Judith Wiker, Dan Godston, and =
other
TBA individuals. This event happens during the 2010 Chicago

Chicago Artists Month

Throughout October, you are invited to meet hundreds of Chicago visual
artists at exhibitions, workshops, open studios, tours, neighborhood art
walks and more in venues across the city. Presented by the Chicago
Department of Cultural Affairs in collaboration with more than 200 =
program
partners, Chicago Artists Month aims to showcase the extraordinary =
talent
and vibrancy of Chicago=92s art community.

=20

This year's theme, "The City as Studio,=94 explores the impact of the =
urban
environment on Chicago artists and their work, and the contributions =
that
artists make to the vitality of our city. The place where art is =
imagined
and made, whether in a physical or virtual space, affects the idea, the
process and the final product. And the art, once created, leaves a mark =
on
the place it occupies. Chicago Artists Month 2010 looks at how the city
influences art and artists, and how artists transform the city by
contributing to civic dialogue and quality of life.

The Myopic Books Poetry <http://www.myopicbookstore.com/poetry.html>  =
Series
presents Two Way Tarot Mirrors, a collaborative writing project which is
part of the Fifth Annual <http://www.chicagocalling.org/>  Chicago =
Calling
Arts Festival, and Chicago Artists Month
<http://www.chicagoartistsmonth.org/> . Two Way Tarot Mirrors involves
people in Chicago working with people elsewhere, on projects wherein =
tarot
cards are part of the collaborative process. Participants will include:
Kristy Bowen (Chicago), Janina Ciezadlo (Chicago), Dan Godston =
(Chicago),
Billie Maciunas (Orlando), Ira Murfin (Chicago), Andrew K. Peterson
(Boston), Larry Sawyer (Chicago), Susan Shie, and other TBA individuals. =

Unlike one=92s reflection in a regular mirror, the playback/feedback in =
TWTM
isn=92t an exact reflection of the original thing that=92s sent. As =
Alice enters
the looking glass, she finds that what=92s on the other side is =
something
different than she had expected; similarly, the two-sided mirror brings
about something different and unexpected. A mirror can seem to be flat, =
yet
it can become three-dimensional, and it can lead to dream worlds. Mirror
games don=92t end up with perfect parallels; i.e. Harpo and Groucho=92s =
mirror
game in Duck Soup.=20

Fifth Annual Chicago Calling Arts Festival

During the Fifth Annual Annual Chicago Calling Arts Festival, =
Chicago-based

U.S.
and abroad. These collaborations involve a range of art forms -- =
including
music, dance, film, literature, and intermedia -- and they are prepared =
or
improvised. Some Chicago Calling events involve live feeds between =
Chicago
and other locations. 2010 Chicago Calling events include =93Bicycles and =

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CDisturb the Universe: The Co=
llected Essays of Adam Fieled=E2=80=9D by Adam Fieled=20
=20

Description:

=20
In "Disturb the Universe: The Collected Essays of Adam Fieled", we see a yo=
ung poet wrestling with old problems: how to move forward and conserve simu=
ltaneously, how to form coherent judgments regarding what will endure and w=
hat will not, how to, as Eliot wrote in =E2=80=9CFour Quartets=E2=80=9D, =
=E2=80=98purify the dialect of the tribe=E2=80=99. These essays are bold st=
abs in search of new directions, which push the envelope past what post-mod=
ernism in poetry has heretofore allowed. They may prove to be enduring benc=
hmarks of a period of transition and turmoil.=20

Actually Niedecker toiled away (as a hospital janitor at times even) in the
boggy wetlands of Black Hawk Island off Lake Koshkonong in Fort Atkinson,
WI. But yes, she's splendid indeed. Condensarist.

I LOVE THE MINA LOY HEART PORTAL!!! Thanks Conrad!!!

Supposedly, Myrna Loy (nee Williams) was inspired by a "wild Russian writer of free verse" to change her surname to match Mina (nee Lowy)'s.

The story is in Carolyn Burke's biography of Mina, "Mina Loy: Becoming Modern."

Now where is the long-promised reissue of her long poem "Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose" and her memoir of Arthur Cravan, "Colossus"?

Dear Steve, hi,
See my poem from 1996  'Not Myrna, Mina'  in my books '50-50' (Little
Esther Books, 1997)
and/or 'Dear Deliria' (Salt Publishing, 2002)

Also, for general interest, an interview I made with Mina Loy's
biographer Carolyn Burke here -
http://jacketmagazine.com/05/mina-iv.html

and

Dear Michael & Lisa,
I missed the Pound thing at the Trans Tasman Symposium too.
Sure you weren't dreaming, up there in the horizontal aisle Michael?

All the best,
Pam

It's only been over the last few years that, suddenly, just about all the
folks in my family as old as my parents have all passed away. My mother and
her four siblings have all died. On my father's side, only his older brother
is still alive; his three sisters are dead.

My mom was the executor of her older sister Georgie's estate. And Georgie
never had any kids. So mom ended up with a lot of photos and things from
Georgie. Scrapbooks of at least a thousand obituaries; diaries; old cheques;
divorce papers; marriage certificates; things like that.

I inherited the house from my parents, and have been going through 40 years
of stuff. Mom found it hard to throw stuff out. I have to throw a lot of it
out. But I was very fond of Georgie, and have tried, over the last few
months, to put together something in her memory. I'm not sure how
interesting it will be to people who didn't know Georgie, but she was quite
remarkable, really, in several ways.

http://vispo.com/georgie takes you to 170 pictures of Georgie arranged from
birth to near the time of her death.

http://vispo.com/georgie/georgie.htm takes you to something I wrote about
Georgie.

I also wrote the software that displays the photos.

Since we've been posting about Mina Loy, and peripherally (sp.?) about Pound's big shadow at a poetic conference, I thought someone might mention THIS moment in literary history, and since no one else has, I'll do so:

In 1921 Ezra Pound wrote to Marianne Moore: "... is there anyone in America except you, Bill [William Carlos Williams] and Mina Loy who can write anything of interest in verse?"
_____________________
However, Loy did not make the cut as far as the 60's poetry anthology edited by Pound and Marcella Spann, _Confucius to Cummings_ (a New Directions paperback from 1964, I suppose the hardback came out before that).

I perhaps have not seen this book at all since I was fascinated by it in the summer of 1973, having a copy out on a summer library loan. I just now checked the Table of Contents as clickable on amazon.com, and the women poets in the book are:

Sappho; Santa Teresa D'Avila; Elizabeth I; Marie-Francoise-Catherine De Beaveau, La Marquise De Boufflers; Felicia Dorothea Hemans; Elizabeth Barrett Browining; H.D.; and Marianne Moore.

Re/ Elizabeth I, and that Marquise, I'd point out that Pound and Spann have a definite bias in favor of the writings of powerful persons in this book. Among the men, we find Henry VIII, Lorenzo De' Medici, and Martin Luther [a translation of "Ein Fester Burg Ist Unser Gott"]

Jim,
Thank you for all these pictures. Georgie's life seems to embody Capra's

Xerolage 46 - STARINGS by Nico Vassilakis

http://xexoxial.org/is/xerolage46/by/nico_vassilakis

    This is what an alphabet does when the books are closed and the
letters are off duty. The characters cavort, mate, replicate,
coagulate, instigate, insinuate, explode... Free of responsibility,
the alphabet dances.

    - Rosaire Appel

    In Starings we enter into a second universe (macro- and
microcosmic at the same time), where letters and punctuation marks are
every bit as real and hallucinatory, transitory and unerasable
creatures as stars, planets, grains of interstellar dust,
microorganisms or atomic particles are in the first one. They
multiply, interweave with each other and with light and darkness, open
frequently like a zip and what we have inside are themselves again in
a different shape. Their presence is so intense that they (and each
contrapuntal pair of their constellations) would start to speak to us
immediately =97 if only letters could do that. Listen. This is meaning
in the moment of birth.

    - M=E1rton Kopp=E1ny

    Nico Vassilakis' STARINGS occupies us by combining radically
different registers of meaning =97 violence and play, destruction and
creation, character and scatter. And we are occupied when we enter
each image, as in taken over or filled up, concentrate on or in, we
have control or have lost control of meaning here. Not that there need
be an either/or in these pages. There is only is. So dwell a while.

    - Jenny Sampirisi

    Most interesting composition results from the mental equivalent of
crossing one's eyes, tuning to a place between. Vassilakis hits a
sweet spot with the dynamic works in Starings, their textures,
accumulations, and rhythmic repetitions creating instances of chaos
and clarity, recognition and refusal.

    - Lisa Radon

from the introduction:

Dear Alphabet=92s Demur,
You take lines and shapes and given possibilities and make alphabet.
You use it to make sounds and you map out trajectories of thought. You
make names and call your children by them. This is done everywhere.
And it=92s been done for thousands of years until you became bored with
this method =97 until you surrounded and suffocated yourself with these
products of your creation.

You go through ubiquitous, unrelenting text =97 you are altered by text,
by its message. You=92ve had to alter how you see. You are forced to
alter text itself. You stare your way through words and into middles
of words. You resolve the noise of your eyes. The information you see,
you seek, to find another nature therein.

REVIEW

"The Noise of Your Eyes" by John Olson on Tillalala Chronicles
http://tillalala.blogspot.com/2010/08/noise-of-your-eyes.html

press), TEXT LOSES TIME (manypenny press), staReduction (Book Thug),
Disparate Magnets (BlazeVox), Protracted Type (Blue Lion Books),

Dodge (redfox press).

With Crag Hill, Nico Vassilakis is editing a major international
anthology of visual poetry, The LastVispo Anthology. Over 130
contributors from over 20 countries.

The primary investigation of Xerolage is how collage technique of 20th
century art, typography, computer graphics, visual & concrete poetry
movements & the art of the copier have been combined. Each issue is
devoted to the work of one artist.

"A ringtone advertises the owner of the mobile phone. It says: listen to me
as I tell a bit about this fellow's difference. By extension, the medium has
become the addressee and could even be a signifier of the addresser. These
days when mobile telephony has brought further stress upon marriages and
other relationships, is it not ingenious to configure the rings in such a
way that the clever addressee can tell who is calling, at least to be able
to know whether to answer, where to answer, what to answer; or to know which
story to tell later to the person eavesdropping by the side? The medium will
eventually be the accomplice as well as the evidence."

No press is proud to announce the publication of
BLASTOGENESIS
by Gregory Betts



Blastogenesis is one form of viral reproduction wherein growth of select
parts accelerate until they break away and become themselves new,
independent organisms with identical or more significantly different
characteristics from the original. Sometimes an out-growth becomes
antagonistic to its source. The Three Words per Poem project tracks the
mutation from harvesting personal data for profit unconsciously to inviting
personal participation for poetry consciously. The short story was written
in response to the media coverage of events in Toronto leading up to the G8
and G20 summits in July 2010. Parts of the story were printed out and posted
to various parts of Toronto during the G20 protests by people associated
with the Poetic Interventions Project.

Xerolage 47 - iu by John Moore Williams

http://xexoxial.org/is/xerolage47/by/john_moore_williams

    What we have here are digital talismanic suggestions. In this
series of vispo, design elements construct a place for you and eye to
land. The dotted i returns u see. Letterforms conjure humanity in
their very simplicity. These compositions rework certain concrete
poetic ideas. The letters i and u undergo new permutations. It=92s a
satisfying jaunt through renewed verbo-visual possibilities. John
Moore Williams is part of the next wave of visual poet.

    - Nico Vassilakis

    I didn't know who I am before I saw Xerolage 47. I didn't know
what I was, or the difference between I and U. I was continually
thinking U were I when you were nothing of the kind. But in this book,
in this John Moore Williams book, we discover that I am the mother of
U, who is I bent in the middle and whose feet point up to the sky.
Sometimes, I am a shadow. Sometimes, I is a change. Sometimes, I am in
a pile of U's and cannot get out. Sometimes, I is a whirling of
shapes. Sometimes, I am spare. Because I go on forever, and I end at
the end of each finger, each of which is just another I. I is clean. I
am dirty. And in John Moore Williams' hands of ten small I's, I is
everywhere and everything, the letter is examined as a meaning and a
shape, the I is made into structures of beauty, and if you read the
book you just might know what I am and you are.

    - Geof Huth

from the introduction:

We are used to thinking of letters as merely media, as windows through
which some message is conveyed without interference. They are the
superconductors of significance, channels devoid of impedance or
static, through which content is, ideally, passed with crystal
clarity. This is perhaps most obviously true of the letter I, which
has become so concretely associated with individual identity that it
has practically disappeared as its own entity. The shape itself
reinforces this disappearance; of all the letterforms it is perhaps
the sparest, the most Spartan. Compounding this is the fact that it
lends itself so easily to the conflation of form and content=97it is,
unlike most single letters, a word, and one that abstractly yet
forcefully resembles its referent. It is the human form in hieroglyph,
a body inscribed.

iu seeks to accept, complicate and reject this conflation, this
crystal-clear union of sign and signifier. In accepting the sparest of
letterforms as its subject, then attempting to create a wide variety
of forms out of this simple cloth, the book embraces the generativity
of restriction. At the same time, it attempts to explore the
multifarious and complex meanings of identity and individuality
through simple, iconic forms. Many of the pieces employ the archetypal
forms and arrangements of the comic book, that most lyric and
identity-obsessed of popular fiction forms, while others work through
more concrete arrangements, attempting to graphically depict the
semantic content in much the same way the letterform itself does. Oh,
and then there=92s the letter U, which our shorthand age has rendered
nearly as pictographic as I.


John Moore Williams claims to be a poet and, occasionally, an artist.
He also claims, marginally more lucratively, to be a copywriter and
editor. It=92s fairly certain that he lives in Oakland, California, and
that he has authored I discover i is an android (Trainwreck Press,
2008), writ10 (VUGG Books, 2008) and [+!] (Calliope Nerve, 2009)=97the
last in collaboration with Matina Stamatakis and Kane X. Faucher. He
also edits the visual poetry journal The Bleed
(avantexte.com/thebleed). His blog is called SinTax
(fissuresofmen.blogspot.com).


The primary investigation of Xerolage is how collage technique of 20th
century art, typography, computer graphics, visual & concrete poetry
movements & the art of the copier have been combined. Each issue is
devoted to the work of one artist.

Subject: Teaching through Turco - help?

Friends,

Again I am teaching through the first 70 pages of Lewis Turco's BOOK OF
FORMS, and again I lack an adequate outline from which to work. These pages
are jam-packed with information that would fall naturally into a traditional,
nested outline, and I've never taken time to write one.  Does anyone have an
outline of this book, or the first 1/3 of this book, to share? I'd be much
obliged...

the rebels, the tormented, and the romantic rovers hovering on the =20
margins of the mainstream who dare to try to make sense of =93Life in =20=

Society=94 and the doorway of 21st century-Brave New World ethos.

Currently, he is developing his first full-length spoken word album, =20
My Dying City, an experimental radio drama that presents itself as a =20
cubistic portrait of a spirit crushed under the weight of corporate-=20
friendly gentrification.

CALL FOR PAPERS | VIRTUAL HISTORIES
Graduate Humanities Forum | http://humanities.sas.upenn.edu/ghf.shtml
Penn Humanities Forum | http://humanities.sas.upenn.edu
University of Pennsylvania

DEADLINE: THURSDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2010
SUBMIT proposals (250 words maximum) and one-page CV by e-mail
attachment to Scott Enderle (enderlej [at] english.upenn.edu).

The Graduate Humanities Forum of the University of Pennsylvania
invites submissions for its 11th annual conference: "Virtual
Histories." The one-day interdisciplinary conference will take place
on Friday, February 18th, 2011 at the Penn Humanities Forum in
conjunction with its 2010-2011 topic: "Virtuality."

Ours is, as the commonplace would have it, an age of information.
Viewed as part of the old-fashioned scheme of Stone, Bronze, and Iron,
our age seems rarefied indeed: hard yet malleable, iron is apt to be
shaped by our will, but information is infinitely more so. Poised to
escape into pure ideality, we may find it easy to forget that the
virtual also has a history.

"Virtual Histories" foregrounds the historical matrix in which our
information technologies are embedded, seeking traces of the virtual
in the rituals and dreams of the past, while at the same time
considering the history of virtuality as one not yet enacted.

We invite submissions from a wide range of disciplines exploring
points of continuity and rupture between past, present, and future
virtualities. How do the other worlds of religious doctrine overlap
with the other world of Second Life? What is the long history of
icons, scripts, and avatars? To what degree are instant wire transfers
more virtual than the bills of sale and credit, bank notes, or paper
money of earlier centuries? What is the phenomenology of a bank run?
What are the ramifications of virtual experience for the empiricism of
Locke, Berkeley, and Hume? What is the material history of the
virtual? How have constructs of gender and race virtualized bodies,
and what are the ethics of bodily escape and transcendence among
Platonic users of sites such as match.com?

At the same time as we seek to historicize the virtual, we invite
contributions that limn possibilities not yet realized, exploring the
potential of distant reading and text mining, and considering
prospects that continue to emerge for politics, social interaction,
and art, not only in visual, but also in auditory and even tactile
forms. What new subjectivities and experiences might the virtual make
available, perhaps even as it calls into question the stability of
those concepts?

Other topics for proposals might include the following:

-The demarcation of the virtual.
-The material bases of virtual superstructures.
-"New" media of past eras and virtual appropriations of "old" media.
-Grammars and ideologies of the virtual.
-Imagined communities and virtual nations.
-Intellectual Property and virtual appropriation.
-Mimesis, simulation, and sensory prosthetics.

saw an ad on tv about training for 'interesting and well-payed careers in
the construction industry'.

it occurs to me i've been in the deconstruction industry for twenty years.

or is it the reconstruction industry? or the preconstruction industry? or is
it the introstruction industry? the introspuction industry? or just the
destruction industry?

the pay sucks. no doubt about it. but the hammerin and yammerin are fun.

i have a course in mind. here's some of the reading. the course would be
called 'language and poetry after godel and turing'. the course would
explore computational poetics. there's some yammerin bout manovitch et all
concerning poetics of new media. ya ya. but get down to the really
revolutionary changes in thought. that's what brought about the computer
revolution in the first place. that's the work of godel and turing.
computational poetics involves the poetics of the universal machine.
universal? in what sense? the course ultimately looks at how notions of who
and what we are have changed in light of the development of the universal
machine. and how our notions of what language is have changed. and how that
has affected poetry from oulipo to contemporary work by poet programmers.

Another quote from Hoftstadter's book.

-----

"Kurt Godel was the first person to realize and exploit the fact that the
positive integers, though they might superficially seem to be very austere
and isolated, in fact constitute a profoundly rich representational medium.

They can mimic or mirror any kind of pattern. Like any human language, where
nouns and verbs (etc) can engage in unlimitedly complex additive and
multiplicative (etc) dancing, and can thereby 'talk', via code or analogy,
about events of any sort, numerical or non-numerical. This is what I meant
when I wrote, in chapter 9, that the seeds of pm's destruction were already
hinted at by the seemingly innocent fact that pm had enough power to talk
about arbitrarily subtle properties of whole numbers.

People of earlier eras had intuited much of this richness when they had
tried to embed the nature of many diverse aspects of the world around us --
stars, planets, atoms, molecules, colors, curves, notes, harmonies,
melodies, and so forth -- in numerical equations or other types of numerical
patterns. Four centureis ago, launcing this whole tendency, Galileo had
famously declared, "The book of Nature is written in the language of
mathematics" . And yet, despite all these centuries of highly successful
mathematizations of various aspects of the world, no one before Godel had
realized that one of the domains that mathematics can model is *the doing of
mathematics itself*.

The bottom line, then, is that the unanticipated self-referential twist that
Godel found lurking inside Prinipia Mathematica was a natural and inevitable
outcome of the deep representational  power of whole numbers. Just as it is
no miracle  that a video system can create a self-referential loop, but
rather a kind  of obvious triviality due to the power of TV cameras (or, to
put it more precisely, the immensely rich representaional power of very
large arrays of pixels), so too it is no miracle that Prinipia Mathematica
(or any other comparable system) contains self-focused sentences like
Godel's  formula, for the system of integers, exactly like a TV camera (only
more so!) can 'point' at any system whatsoever and can reproduce that
system's patterns perfectly on the the metaphorical 'screen' constituted by
its set of theorems. And just as in video feedback, the swirsls that result
from PM pointing at itself have all sorts of unexpected, emergent properties
that require a brand-new vocabulary to describe them." (p 161).

------

The positive integers as "a profoundly rich representational medium" is, of
course, right in front of our nose. This text is ultimately represented
with/by integers in the computer. And the multimedia nature of the computer
is, again, a consequence of the strong representational capacities of the
integers.

Consequences for poetry?

Well, poetry, for me, is about intensest engagement with language. Intensest
in what way? Well, intensest significance in all ways. Godel and Turing's
work has rocked not only mathematical logic but philosophy, understood
properly, and also the quotidian via the computer revolution. Their work has
ushered in profound changes in what we think of as language and of how
language and number relate to one another. And their work has ushered in
profound changes in who and what we think we are. Their work has allowed us
to see how we ourselves can be thought of as machines--without demeaning
ourselves or our capacities at all--for their work has shown us that the
notion of a universal machine is incomparably far beyond the notion of
'dedicated machine' that we have known for so long to circumscribe our
notions of what machines are.

Poetry is uncoupled now from a notion of it as dedicated solely to words on
paper. Not to go there is as regressive as to think of machines simply as
necessarily being dedicated as they have been in the past.

i'm reading douglas hofstadter's book 'i am a strange loop' at the moment.

wow! what a book!

this email is addressed to jason quackenbush and anyone else who
followed/follows our friendly debate concerning the godel+turing vs
wittgenstein issue.

i'm finding hofstadter's book, jason, revelatory about the deepest,
profoundest contributions of godel and turing. that's what i want to try to
address in this email, to some extent.

first i should say that i always found his earlier book 'godel escher bach'
hard to read. it had such a 'golly gee' tone. whereas 'i am a strange loop'
is mature.

hofstadter sees godel as being the first person to realize that the formal
system of principia mathematica (pm) is capable of simulating many other
systems. say what? simulating? what does that mean?

well, consider 'godel numbering'. anyone who has looked at godel's proof of
the existence of undecidable propositions has looked at 'godel numbering'.
which was a way of simulating pm in pm. in particular, godel was able to
show that a proposition very like 'this proposition is not provable' is
well-formed in pm and is undecidable, ie, can be neither proved nor
disproved; in other words, it can't be proved and is true in pm.

to show the existencee of such undecidable propositions (and, hence, the
incompleteness of systems such as pm), godel worked out 'godel numbering',
ie, a very clever way of mapping all possible propositions to the natural
numbers, and a way of mapping, say, the rules of inference of pm to
recursive combinatorial mathematical functions from the set of integers to
the set of integers.

we can think of this as a kind of programming. where the programming
language only allows arithemetic. and what is being programmed is a
simulation of principia mathematica.

of course, what goes on in  computers, at the hardware level, is just
arithmetic. adding of integers. multiplication of integers. though it's in
base 2.

"Computers originated as integer-calculation machines, and they are still of
course validly describable as such -- but we now realize, as Kurt Godel
first did back in 1931, that such devices can be equally  validly perceived
and talked about in terms that are fantastically different from what their
originators intended" (Hoftstadter, page 245)

Hofstadter takes up the notion of the 'universal machine' at some length.
And of 'universal beings'. and this is getting close to the real
significance of the book and of Hofstadter's deepest theme since godel
escher bach.

a 'universal machine', roughly speaking, is one that is not dedicated and
limited to any particular task. our computers, being programmable, can be
programmed to do anything any conceivable machine can do. the 'turing
machine' is as powerful as any possible machine. just like pm is basically
as powerful as any of the other formal systems we might use. pm and similar
systems, that are simply capable of arithmetic, are the standard
mathematical formal systems.

hofstadter talks about the simple notion of a universal machine, ie, one
that isn't dedicated to a particular task. then he says:

"You can use the hardware inside a cell phone to house a word processor, a
web browser, a gaggle of video games, and on and on. This, in essence, is
what the computer revolution is all about: when a certain well-defined
threshhold--I'll call it the 'Godel-Turing threshhold'--is surpassed, then a
computer can emulate *any* kind of machine." (p 242)

And a couple of paragraphs later:

"Inspired by Godel's mapping of PM into itself, Turing realized that the
critical threshold for this kind of computational universality comes at
exactly that point where a machine is flexible enough to read and correctly
interpret a set of data that describe its own structure. At this crucial
juncture, a machine can, in principle, explicitly watch how it does any
particular task, step by step. Turing realized that a machine that has this
critical level of flexibility can imitate any other machine no matter how
complex the latter is. In other words, there is nothing more flexible than a
universal machine. Universality is as far as you can go." (p 242)

"The early computer engineers  thought of their computers as
number-crunching devices and did not see numbers as a universal medium.
Today, we do not see numbers that way either, but our lack of understanding
is for an entirely different reason--in fact for exactly the opposite
reason. Today it is because all those numbers are so neatly hidden behind
the screen.... I could list hundreds of things that take place on computer
screens, but few people ever think about the fact that all of this is
happening couresy of *addition and multiplication of integers* way down at
the hardware level. (p. 244)

Of course, the main theme of Hofstadter's book 'I Am A Strange Loop'
concerns the relation of our own nature to that of the universal machine,
and the sort of universality he talks about. I won't go into that in this
email. A fascinating book, though. I highly recommend it.

"once upon a time, way way back in October 1994, rob mclennan & James
Spyker invented a two-day event called the ottawa small press book fair,
and held the first one at the National Archives of Canada..." Spyker moved

address, email, web address, contact person, type of publications, list of
publications (with price), if submissions are being considered & any other
pertinent info, including upcoming ottawa-area events (if any).

& don't forget the pre-fair reading usually held the night before, info tba!

also, due to the increased demand for table space, exhibitors are asked to

including (at previous events) Bywords, Dusty Owl, Chaudiere Books,
above/ground press, Room 302 Books, The Puritan, The Ottawa Arts Review,
Buschek Books, The Grunge Papers, Broken Jaw Press, BookThug, Proper Tales
Press, and others.

happens twice a year, founded in 1994 by rob mclennan & James Spyker.
now run by rob mclennan thru span-o.questions, az421@freenet.carleton.ca

free things can be mailed for fair distribution to the same address. we
will not be selling things for folk who cant make it, sorry. also, always
looking for volunteers to poster, move tables, that sort of thing. let me
know if anyone able to do anything. thanks.

for more information, bother rob mclennan.if you're able/willing to

POETS MAKE FROM THEM =AD KAREN WEISER
FRIDAYS 7PM =8B 9PM / 10 SESSIONS / BEGINS OCTOBER 8TH

So much of how we think of history comes to us in the form of narratives.
What happens to our understanding when that text from the past is poetry or
is re-visioned into poetry? How do poets work with historical texts or
different kinds of older disciplinary narratives? For a brief period early
scientific texts were poems, and yet our culture seems to have mostly
forgotten that poetry has the capacity to be wide in what it attempts to do
or think through. Lisa Robertson writes in the poem =B3Palinode/=B2: =B3Though my
object is history, not neutrality / I am prepared to adhere to neither
extreme.=B2 My hope is that we can explore our own writing as it comes out of
a reading practice, considering history without feeling inclined to =B3adhere=
=B2
to its formulations. We will look at pairings made up of contemporary poems
and the works (or historical subjects) they converse with, seriously
engaging both texts on their own terms and together, while writing poems
that make use of the past to open new vistas of inquiry. =A0 Some texts will
include selections from: A Key Into the Language of America by Rosmarie
Waldrop and A Key Into the Language of America by Roger Williams; Fred

y
=B3up & coming=B2 neighborhood, shares an apartment with 5 other people (three
of which are in a band) and juggles a series of poorly paying and widely
scattered teaching jobs? This workshop focuses on the art of writing where
you happen to be and taking advantage of a few snatched moments in a coffee
bar or on a seat in a slowly moving =B3G=B2 train. Working paradigms include
Frank O=B9Hara =8Cs Lunch Poems, written during the noon sup on a stationary
store=B9s chained typewriter (instructor will explain this piece of equipment
to those under 30), Philip Whalen=B9s poetry of notebooks compressed into
viable worlds, Paul Blackburn=B9s subway poems and his open-form Journals

notebook, some form of writing device and a Metro Card with some money on
it. Joel Lewis travels to work via ferry, light rail subway, bus and goat
cart to his social work gig on Staten Island =8B always with a roller ball pe=

4th generation of New York School Poets, while serving as the poetic
conscious for the state of New Jersey. With that in mind, his most recent
book is Learning From New Jersey (Talisman House).


OUT OF YOUR MIND (AND IN YOUR BODY): A MOVEMENT WORKSHOP FOR WRITERS =AD SALL=
Y
SILVERS=20
TUESDAYS AT 7PM =8B 9PM / 10 SESSIONS / BEGINS OCTOBER 12TH

This is a movement workshop for writers who want to explore creating
movement out of words and writing out of movement. No dance, theater, or
athletic ability/experience is required. Dancers or choreographers who want
to work with language and with untrained movers are also very welcome.=A0
We=B9ll start with a physical warm up designed to fire up your senses, center
you in your body, and get your creative juices flowing.=A0 We=B9ll explore ways
of writing inspired by movement.=A0 We=B9ll look at people moving on video (fro=
m
Jerry Lewis, and Robin Williams to sports to break dancing, from Yvonne
Rainer, Douglas Dunn, Bill T. Jones to my own dances) with an eye toward ne=
w
kinds of writing:=A0 texts to accompany performance, to combine poetry with
documentation, that designs movement or is energized by it.=A0 We=B9ll look at
some texts that have inspired or accompanied dance & performance (from Emil=
y
Dickinson to Vito Acconci to John Cage, etc.)=A0 And we=B9ll especially look at
our own writing to imagine performing it=A0 & putting it in motion. Through
collaborations, talking about videos, writing and editing together and
alone, we=B9ll create performances that spotlight the experiments that start
with our bodies. When you stimulate your body, your creative process comes
alive in ways that will amaze you.=A0 Let=B9s open some new horizons for your
writing.=A0 Did I already say no movement training or dance experience
necessary? Wear or bring comfortable clothes & shoes. Sally Silvers is
writer/ choreographer who has been making dances and texts for 30 years.=A0
Her first group work featured non-dancer poets.=A0 She also currently dances
for Yvonne Rainer.=A0


THE IRREPARABLE, IRRETRIEVABLE AND FORGIVENESS =AD AKILAH OLIVER
SATURDAYS AT NOON =8B 2PM / 5 SESSIONS / BEGINS NOVEMBER 13TH

For this workshop process, consider the poem as that which poses the
question, that the poem doesn=B9t necessarily represent knowledge or
=B3experience=B2, but rather seeks to understand the world, in all its terribly
beautiful humanness. What is rupture? Rapture?=A0 What does it mean,
essentially, to forgive?=A0 Are both loss and love forms of the
irretrievable?=A0 In this workshop, we will pay careful attention to the
composition of the poem as a process as of investigation and discovery into
these questions, and the many questions that spin off from these.=A0 Can
language, poetry, the collapsing of text, create an/other text that
transmutes, holds, witnesses, traces, and recreates itself?=A0 Where does the
body enter this discourse? Where does the sentence/line begin?=A0 Can a poem
witness?=A0 This workshop invites participants think of the poem as a
compositional field to investigate the irreparable, the irretrievable, and
forgiveness.=A0 We will look at theory and philosophical texts next to poetry=
,
and vice versa. For example, Alice Notley read alongside Giorgio Agamben;
Avital Ronell read alongside Leslie Scalapino. A poet, performer, and
teacher, Akilah Oliver=B9s most recent book is A Toast in the House of Friend=
s
(Coffee House Books).

can you not escape the nagging doubt that the world is just a shuffled pack of lies?
as global art histories are gleefully consumed by flames!

an art-memoir: five stunning 2000+ page volumes: PPP
(pleated plaid pamphlets series)

fresh new scans recompiled as massive collections covering 40+ years of personal art
activity; includes an evolving full-colour compilation of the earlier, smaller
pamphlets featuring a pleated-plaid frontispiece: all five mega-volumes available

everybody knows that the dice are loaded
everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
everybody knows that the war is over
everybody knows the good guys lost
everybody knows the fight was fixed
the poor stay poor, the rich get rich
that's how it goes
everybody knows
everybody knows that the boat is leaking
everybody knows that the captain lied
everybody has this broken feeling
like their father or their dog just died


injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere
we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality
tied in a single garment of destiny
whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly

Cervena Barva Press Announces a New Book=20
"Triage" by Tam Lin Neville=20

=C2=A0=20

Tam Lin Neville lives and writes in Somerville, MA. Journey Cake , her prev=
ious poetry collection, was published by BkMk Press (University of Missouri=
, Kansas City). She has received a Somerville Arts Council grant. Her poems=
 have appeared in Harvard Review, Mademoiselle, American Poetry Review, Iro=
nwood and Sulfur , among others. With her husband, Bert Stern, she co-edits=
 Off The Grid Press, a press for poets over sixty. She also works for Chang=
ing Lives Through Literature, an alternative sentencing program.=20


Tam Lin Neville=E2=80=99s new book, Triage , reminds us that our cherished =
notions of freedom, happiness and plenty actually conceal large communities=
 of entrapment, misery and poverty where many are simply left to die =E2=80=
=93 triaged, if you will =E2=80=93 in front of our eyes. An observant neigh=
bor, a journalist, and above all, a poet of great skill and heart, Neville =
speaks for those who cannot speak for themselves. Few poets writing today h=
ave the patience and talent to guide us toward such a civilizing compassion=
.=20
=E2=80=94Roger Mitchell=20

Behind this remarkable book is a mind that has long contemplated the humani=
ty of those she meets every day =E2=80=93 neighbor, stranger, friend. Yet s=
he speaks from a respectful distance and this enables her to write poems wi=
th no self-interest, only clear sight and generosity. Her language is spare=
, stripped of all aesthetic preening, creating a poetry that is both accura=
te and visionary.=20
=E2=80=94Betsy Sholl=20

Triage is a tough, uncompromising book, but one that=E2=80=99s also big-hea=
rted, despite the sorrow so evident in the title and in many of the individ=
ual poems. Written with great economy and precision, the lyric here is not =
merely a display of skill, but a form of wisdom literature, a site map to h=
elp us navigate these difficult times. I hear the voices of Dickinson and N=
iedecker =E2=80=93 stern mentors, indeed. In Neville=E2=80=99s poems their =
legacies are gracefully and fearlessly served.=20

Regarding the Deconstruction industry:

Just briefly (this is not exactly in response to the deconstruction
industry/construction industry thing):  I'm working on a thesis in
Paris about the auto-translation of Beckett and the
translation/reception of Derrida in the United States, and I realized
that many people who read Derrida don't know that Deconstruction is
not a made up word in French=97which to my mind changes implicitly the
reception and understanding of the concept.

Well, ok, Deconstruction is a made up word in French but it wasn't
made up by Derrida, and it's not a bizarre, fancy sounding word that
to most people actually just means, "word you would never understand
so you should never use".  For example, you see it constantly on the
side of buildings that are "under construction"=97which means, not that
the building is being torn down and rebuilt, but that the structure of
the building remains intact while certain defunct features are being
removed and replaced or redone.  In America we might call this
remodeling or rehabbing.

I am still looking for a better word in English to translate this
word, but have not quite found it.  Perhaps "under construction" is
actually perfect.

I think this is useful, not only for understanding Deconstruction but
even for pedagogical purposes.  I remember being an undergraduate and
wanting very badly to understand what Deconstruction was but have many
professors evade the subject.  If someone had just translated the word
for me and explained that in this case it refers to texts instead of
buildings I would have been very happy I think.

Ok, thanks!

Lily

*JAZZ TALMUD: WORLD PREMIERE*



Jazz Talmud is a poetry and music project with Talmudic modes of dialog,
spontaneous interpretations, interruptions, arguing, and the ecstatic
attempts at wisdom. The poems mimic Talmudic rhetoric, style and turns of
phrase, as they reflect on the contemporary Jewish experience, jazz, dreams=
,
loneliness and more. The horn players, acting as Talmud=92s interpreters Ra=
shi
and Tosefot spontaneously riff on the spoken material and each other=92s
reaction to it.

* *

*AYN SOF ARKESTRA & BIGGER BAND*

NYC=92s newest addition to the canon of new Jewish influenced music and
culture, the Ayn Sof Arkestra and Bigger Band, under the direction of
saxophonist Jazz Rabbi Greg Wall and grammy winning trumpeter Frank London.
The Arkestra consists of some of the most innovative artists on the scene
today, such as Pam Fleming, Paul Shapiro, Aaron Alexander, Fima Ephron, Eya=
l
Maoz and many others. The repertoire will consist of original compositions
and arrangements of the members and guest composers, in the great NuJu/Rad
Jew/SunRaJoo tradition.


*About the artists:*

*
*

*Jake Marmer* merges poetry, music, and performance into various
philosophically potent mixtures. He has performed extensively in New Yorkan=
d
Jerusalem with his band Frantic Turtle, Mima=92amakim collective, and vario=
us
hip downtown characters.

Trumpeter/composer *Frank London* is a Grammy-winning member of the
Klezmatics, and has performed with John Zorn, LL Cool J, Mel Torme, LaMonte
Young, They Might Be Giants, David Byrne, among others.  He is featured on
over 100 CDs.

Saxophonist *Greg Wall* has performed and recorded with Hasidic New Wave,
Greg Wall Trio, The Wall/London Band, Neshama Carlebach, the Hi-Tops, Greg
Wall's Unity Orchestra, and has made many session appearances for record
dates and film scores.

The *Ayn Sof Arkestra and Bigger Band* is 15-piece radical jazz and klezmer
project under the direction of Greg Wall and Frank London. It's NYC=92s new=
est
and hottest addition to the canon of Jewish influenced music and culture.

Lily,
I find this redefinition very helpful -- I wish I had learned it in grad
school.
It connects deconstructionism with  urban life more seemlessly -- the way
"Modernism"
refers to architecture as well as a literary movement.
Thanks,
Carol

Deconstruction is absolutely not a made-up word in either French or English=
.
 Derrida quite deliberately seized upon an existing word, in part to
distinguish what he was talking about from Heidegger's "destruction."  In
America, Russell Atkins (see my essay in the current poetics issue of MELUS=
)
was writing essays about a critical deconstruction in the late 1950s.

Hi, Lily,

but deconstructionism in literature does not mean remodeling. It is a much
more drastic reviewing of the nature of literature. Whatever deconstruction
means when on the side of a building, it does not mean that in Derrida, for
instance. Deconstructionism is more like saying that a building is designed
by its inhabitants and not by its architects. The confusion is
understandable. It requires a reorientation of thinking.

Ciao,

Murat

"Alexander's verbal flights strike me as more shamanistic than
free-associational or automatic. His evocation of upper and lower worlds,
and his vocabulary which bridges poetry, philosophy, myth, and science, giv=
e
his verbal fulgurations a sense of linguistic seed that suddenly sprouts,
then resprouts . . . . He may be the first major =91outsider artist' in
American poetry. Whatever he is, he is a force to reckon with, whose
self-propelled soarings evoke Simon Rodia's =91Watt's Tower' as well as
Siberian ecstasies."
*=97*Clayton Eshleman, *American Poet*

"Alexander's poems are unpunctuated, their expanding structures suggest tha=
t
each might be read as a single very long, very complex sentence . . . a
complex sentence machine turning out elaborate grammatical parallelisms,
extensive series of epic catalogues, and open-ended syntax of discordant
clauses and appended prepositional phrases."

Dear Poetics List=E2=80=94

I=E2=80=99m writing today in my capacity as guest editor for The Journal of=
 Electronic Publishing, which has been a pioneer in responding critically t=
o digital technologies=E2=80=99 impact on =E2=80=9Cpublishing=E2=80=9D as b=
oth a notion and a semiotic distribution system since 1995 (before there wa=
s even a google to google-sculpt with!).=20
=0A=C2=A0
=0AJEP is published by the Scholarly Publishing Office (SPO), a unit of the=
 University of Michigan Library, which is committed to designing affordable=
 and sustainable publishing solutions in the =E2=80=9Cnetwork era=E2=80=9D =
(with a serious commitment to open-access publishing).
=0A=C2=A0
=0AJEP=E2=80=99s long-time editor, Judith Axel Turner, is retiring, and I h=
ave been asked to curate one of several issues to be published in the inter=
im before a new editor-in-chief is appointed.
=0A=C2=A0
=0AGiven my interests and background, I=E2=80=99ve chosen to put together a=
n issue broadly dedicated to digital poetry publishing. I=E2=80=99m hoping =
you might be interested in contributing an article. This issue will bring t=
ogether many distinct but related conversations concerning relationships be=
tween poetry and the wide array of digital prostheses that are shaping and =
have shaped 21st Century poetics. I=E2=80=99m also hoping this issue will b=
ring the pertinent conversations to the attention of new audiences. Submiss=
ion deadline is April 15, 2011.
=0A=C2=A0
=0AA short (but not exhaustive) list of areas of focus for this issue inclu=
des:=20
=0A=C2=A0
=0A1. =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0The status of the digital poetry =E2=80=9Cutopia.=
=E2=80=9D With approximately ten years of broadband-living now behind us, a=
re we in a position to reassess (perhaps reaffirm) the early promise of dig=
ital media for poetry and poetics? Or, from a more phenomenological angle=
=E2=80=A6 has reading without paper changed, and/or is it still changing, t=
he experience of poetry? So what?
=0A
=0A2. =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0How has digital poetry publishing impacted poetry p=
edagogy (in either creative writing or more traditional study)?
=0A
=0A3. =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0How has digital publishing influenced or alte=
red the notion of what a poetry =E2=80=9Cbook=E2=80=9D is or should be? How=
 has is changed or not changed the economics of poetry book publication? Ho=
w has is changed or not changed the =E2=80=9Ccultural capital=E2=80=9D atta=
ched to such publication?
=0A
=0A4. =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0Digital media and poetry community/communities. The=
 social aspects (especially as market potential) of digital networking have=
 been discussed ad nauseam for several years. Blogs. Facebook. Etc. Still, =
poetry=E2=80=99s coterieism has an ancient provenance. What unique problems=
 or benefits have come=E2=80=94or are coming=E2=80=94for poetry with the on=
-going acceleration of electronic interconnection?
=0A
=0A5. =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0Media/Form/Content. How is the stuff of digital med=
ia blending with the stuff of poetry? Immediately, I=E2=80=99m thinking of =
the way Flarf takes algorithmic formal modeling and raw textual content fro=
m various digital locations to make something new, to reflects on its own p=
arts, and also reflect outward on the broader social, political, and econom=
ic circumstances that generate and shape the sources. But I=E2=80=99m using=
 Flarf here as shorthand for many developments where the product and proces=
s of digital publishing blur in significant ways. =C2=A0=C2=A0
=0A
=0A
=0AI=E2=80=99m expecting mainly to publish pieces that are critical or, at =
least, quasi-scholarly, but that doesn=E2=80=99t mean the issue has no room=
 for creative or essayistic work. In some cases, a review of contexts will =
make sense, but ultimately I=E2=80=99m looking for work that builds from co=
ntexts to unique arguments and insights about a specific facet of the relat=
ionships between =E2=80=9Cdigital publishing=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cpoetry.=
=E2=80=9D I=E2=80=99m happy to consider re-publishing a relevant piece as l=
ong as you own the rights or are able to get permission to reuse the materi=
al.
=0A=C2=A0
=0APlease let me know if this prospect appeals to you, and I=E2=80=99d be h=
appy to give you more information (including deadlines, etc.). I=E2=80=99m =
also happy to help you brainstorm if you are interested in contributing but=
 also interested in bouncing some ideas around with me first.
=0A=C2=A0
=0AMore information about JEP and SPO (including links) are at the end of t=
his letter.
=0A=C2=A0

=0AThe Journal of Electronic Publishing (JEP), http://www.journalofelectron=
icpublishing.org/, is a forum for research and discussion about contemporar=
y publishing practices, and the impact of those practices upon users. Our c=
ontributors and readers are publishers, scholars, librarians, journalists, =
students, technologists, attorneys, retailers, and others with an interest =
in the methods and means of contemporary publishing. At its inception in Ja=
nuary 1995, JEP carved out an important niche by recognizing that print com=
munication was in the throes of significant change, and that digital commun=
ication would become an important--and in some cases predominant--means for=
 transmitting published information.

If there is a professional organization for those of us who write (about) e=
xperimental poetry, then I don't know what it is.  If there is such a thing=
, please enlighten me.

If there isn't, then perhaps it's time to start one.  I know many of us are=
 anti-establishment, anti-academy, yada yada, and there certainly is no imp=
erative for everyone or anyone to join.  However, since so many of us try t=
o make a living in, around, and about innovative poetry, it seems prudent a=
nd timely.

Sure we go to conferences, like MLA, &Now, and Louisville's 20C conference;=
 even AWP has become hospitable to those of us who do not do referential, e=
xpressive poetry.  Certainly, I think many of us have been piggybacking on =
the Modernist Studies Association or other groups like that as a home-away-=
from-home, but I always feel so schizophrenic when I'm there, with papers o=
n Edwardian periodicals and fashion AND Charles Bernstein, as if the were f=
rom the same epoch.  Maybe they are, but I think genre and an attitude towa=
rds modernity make a difference.

If anyone is interested in forming a formal organization, either as a stand=
-alone entity, one with an annual conference, or as a part of the MLA, back=
channel me.

points all well taken -- but I don't think you'll find Derrida responding
favorably to "deconstructionism."

Subject:      Sign After the X by David Clark

David Clarke has created a new work of net art called Sign After the X (
http://signafterthex.net ) in collaboration with Marina Roy and Graham
Meisner. Sign After the X is structurally similar to some of Clark's earlier
works such as A is for Apple (http://aisforapple.net ) and 88 Constellations
for Wittgenstein ( http://88constellations.net ). The form of these works is
one that Clark has been developing for some time now; A is for Apple, the
first of them, was published in 2002.

The nodes or chapters or sections of these hypermedia works are done in
Flash. They're multimedia approaches to a subject. We hear a voice reading a
text about Freud or Lacan or Wittgenstein or X (etc) while Clark's animated
visuals improvise with the text--in the sense that the visuals explicate or
explore or expand or riff on the text's meaning. Sign After the X is
organized into five categories: Mind, Body, Land, Language, and Law. Each of
these contains anywhere from four to thirty nodes/Flash works.

The putative subject of Sign After the X is "the letter X and it's multiple
meanings in our culture". And, yes, I can see that in some of the material
presented. But it seems to me there's considerably more going on than that.

For instance, in the 'Mind' section, we encounter about thirty hypermedia
works, many of which are explanatory of or exploratory of Freud's ideas.
Perhaps these are indeed related to X, but I don't know how. However, that
is not a criticism; the hypermedia works are often compelling in their
voiced text and almost always are interesting in their visual nature and
workings. The connection with X is not obvious and might emerge with more
exploration of other parts of the work, which is unusually large for a work
of net art.

Some of the hypermedia works are not so good. The reading of Coleridge's
"Kubla Kahn", for instance. Particularly by the guy who normally reads those
theorified texts. Yeesh. But many of them are fascinating and considerably
more original than a bad reading of "Kubla Khan" accompanied with mild
visuals. The interest of Clark's work, to me, is in his avoiding, for the
most part, such cliches of  digital literary production. His background is
in visual art. The individual nodes are often very polished, and that which
links them, and the resulting overall shape and semantic, thematic
structure, are of great interest in these fascinating works by David Clark.
I don't see anyone else exploring this sort of form in the same way Clark
has been since 2002.

If you find Sign After the X of interest, you should also check out his site
http://chemicalpictures.net  for other projects and writings.

from Queens born to West Indian parents. An outsider artist from the =20
get go, he has no degree and has won no awards. His stories, plays, =20

the rebels, the tormented, and the romantic rovers hovering on the =20
margins of the mainstream who dare to try to make sense of =93Life in =20=

Society=94 and the doorway of 21st century-Brave New World ethos.

Currently, he is developing his first full-length spoken word album, =20
My Dying City, an experimental radio drama that presents itself as a =20
cubistic portrait of a spirit crushed under the weight of corporate-=20
friendly gentrification.

Rachel Loden is the author of Dick of the Dead (Ahsahta Press), a finalist
for both the 2010 PEN USA Literary Award for Poetry and the California Book
Award. It was also one of the three most-cited books in Attention Span 2009
("a collectively-drawn map of the field"), landing on lists by Rae
Armantrout and others. The Washington Post's "Poet's Choice" column featured
a poem from the book and it has been called "oddly sublime" and
"intoxicating" by the Poetry Project Newsletter and "expansive and
whimsical" by the Brooklyn Rail. Loden's first book, Hotel Imperium
(Georgia), won the Contemporary Poetry Series competition and was selected
as one of the ten best poetry books of the year by the San Francisco
Chronicle, which called it "quirky and beguiling." It was also short-listed
for the Northern California Book Award. Loden has published four chapbooks,
including The Last Campaign (which won the Hudson Valley Writers' Center
chapbook competition) and The Richard Nixon Snow Globe (Wild Honey Press).
Her work has appeared or is forthcoming in New American Writing, Lana
Turner: A Journal of Poetry and Opinion, two editions of the Best American
Poetry series, Western Wind: An Introduction to Poetry, and many other
magazines and anthologies. Loden's microplay, "A Quaker Meeting in Yorba
Linda," was performed in New York as part of Plays on Words: A Poets Theater
Festival curated by Tony Torn, Lee Ann Brown and Corina Copp. She is the
recipient of a Pushcart Prize, a Fellowship in Poetry from the California
Arts Council, an &NOW Award, and a grant from the Fund for Poetry.

i just thought this was very now and then.

http://www.google.ca/images?q=winslow standin on the corner
make sure you copy the whole line or you won't get the 'standin on the
corner' part of the url.

these are pictures taken in winslow arizona. the good folks of winslow
arizona made this magical spot, a homage to the eagles's song from the 70's
"take it easy" which contains the lines

well i'm standin on a corner
in winslow arizona
such a fine sight to see
it's a girl, my lord,
in a flat-bed ford
slowin down to take a look at me
come on, baby, don't say maybe
i gotta know if your sweet love is
gonna save me
we may lose and we may win though
we will never be here again
so open up, I'm climbin' in,
so take it easy

you see the reflection in the window of the blonde in the truck. and an
eagle perched on the window on the second floor. and the glenn frey/jackson
brownish guy with the guitar.

well, it turns out that the whole thing is in danger now cuz the building
next door to it burned down. the site is fenced off and they need $35,000 to
repair it. and, these days in winslow, that money just ain't around.

the happy ending, of course, would be if one of those millionaire eagles
coughed up the cash.

"take it easy" was the first song on the first eagles album. and, though
they made many brilliant songs, "take it easy" is probably the best of them.
jackson browne wrote most of it. glenn frey heard browne playing it
downstairs and asked if he could use it for his new band. jackson said yes
but you have to finish it. wow did frey finish it.

and they don't owe the folks in winslow anything, perhaps, but thanks for
making such a beautiful thing in homage to their song. a place where lots of
people suddenly found themselves, as it were, in one of their favorite
songs.

but it's sad the place is maybe going down. can't even 'take it easy'
anymore without a fence around it and demolition a possibility.

i thought that was an interesting comment on the state of things now. and in
relation to another era in usamerican history.

IMRAM, a national literary festival in Ireland, in association with
the Dublin City Arts Centre, will present "tr=EDd an gcoill" by S=E9amas
Cain and Slavek Kwi.

This Installation with recorded or live
performances will take place at 1:00 p.m. to 5:45 p.m. from September
23 through September 27, 2010 at the Grapevine Space of CITY ARTS, 15
Bachelor=92s Walk, Dublin 1, Ireland.

The Opening for "tr=EDd an gcoill" will be held at 1:00 p.m. on September 2=
3.
Admission is free.

For additional information phone
Nick Reilly at CITY ARTS, i.e.,

Phone (+353)(1)902.2414 ...

http://www.cityarts.ie/events/2010/09/23/-trid-an-gcoill

tr=EDd an gcoill
"through the woods"

A collection of reality-particles; sounds and images from Dromore
Woods.  An audiovisual installation, with recorded or live
performances.

tr=EDd an gcoill, a 120-page poem by S=E9amas Cain, is itself a poetic
field recording.  It evokes a walk through Dromore Woods in County
Clare.  It immerses the reader in a stream of words and word-clusters.
 The overall effect is hypnotic, as we are led by a piped piper into
the heart of the wood.

Czech sound-artist Slavek Kwi has created an audiovisual installation
from underwater and field recordings captured in Dromore Woods itself,
and fused these elements with S=E9amas Cain's chanted recital of tr=EDd an
gcoill.  This installation with performances will be open to the
public in City Arts, with Free Admission.  tr=EDd an gcoill creates a
unique space in which one can experience nature and language through
sounds and visions of uncanny beauty.

S=E9amas Cain is an Irish-American experimental poet, a friend and
colleague of Jean Genet and Allen Ginsberg.  One of the most radical
voices in modern literature he writes in Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Old
Celtic, Spanish and English.

For additional information, go to ...

http://seamascain-writernetwork.org

Slavek Kwi is a Czech sound-artist, composer and researcher. From the
early nineties he has operated under the name "Artificial Memory
Trace."

For additional information, go to ...

http://www.artificialmemorytrace.com

Seamus Johnson described Cain's recorded chantings of tr=EDd an gcoill
for this Installation as "incantatory, rhythmic, passionate, guttural,
mezmerizing.  Cain is the baritone ascending to Apollo.  Or, is he the
baritone ascending Mt. Carmel?  He does tend to get carried away in
performance, lost in a kind of trance, at times in the passion of the
moment whacking the microphones.  Indeed, Cain's performance is
hypnotic!  Plenty of auditory images!  And plenty of rich and diverse
sounds to be chopped up for computer-randomization!"

Slavek Kwi used chance operations to distribute the fragments of
Cain's chantings in various speakers of a vertical Speaker Tree, which
doesn't brake the continuous chanting, but changes the architecture as
texture and dynamics.  Also, Kwi used chance operations on the
distribution in speakers of the timbre of Cain's chantings.

Kwi's Installation includes a color film, with parts of the text of
the tr=EDd an gcoill poem superimposed in scrolling effect over images
from Dromore Woods, a slide-show with 1,500 slides, an environmental
soundtrack on external 5.1 system and also a Voice Tower, all edited
using chance operations.  Kwi's Installation also includes physical
objects from Dromore Woods.

saw an ad on tv about training for 'interesting and well-payed careers in the construction industry'.

it occurs to me i've been in the deconstruction industry for twenty years.

or is it the reconstruction industry? or the preconstruction industry? or is it the introstruction industry? the introspuction industry? or just the destruction industry?

the pay sucks. no doubt about it. but the hammerin and yammerin are fun.

i have a course in mind. here's some of the reading. the course would be called 'language and poetry after godel and turing'. the course would explore computational poetics. there's some yammerin bout manovitch et all concerning poetics of new media. ya ya. but get down to the really revolutionary changes in thought. that's what brought about the computer revolution in the first place. that's the work of godel and turing. computational poetics involves the poetics of the universal machine. universal? in what sense? the course ultimately looks at how notions of who and what we are have changed in light of the development of the universal machine. and how our notions of what language is have changed. and how that has affected poetry from oulipo to contemporary work by poet programmers.

language and poetry after godel and turing.

but, in poetry circles, godel and turing just do not compute, as you see in
the responses to this thread, which dealt with derrida, not godel and
turing.

and this is one of the reasons why poetry itself is isolated.

poetry, these days, needs to be an umbrella term for deep concerns of
language and art cross-stitched amongs many fields and modes of
perception/reception. for instance, the role of language in contemporary
mathematical logic is of philosophical significance and also has turned out
to be of very practical significance in that the work of godel and turing
led to the creation of the computer, that universal number+language machine.

the philosophical underpinnings of the poetics of computation, of computer
art, can be strongly linked with the work of godel and turing and its
consequences concerning language, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and the
multimedial/intermedial.

poetry needs to be able to travel at the forefront of any field.

Hello Murat!

It's true Deconstruction is not the same thing as remodeling.
However, I think it is very important when reading and especially in
teaching Derrida to understand the effects of the translation=97what is
lost and gained in the passage from one language to another.
Deconstruction is primarily a method of reading that is tied to a long
and complex history of many different (textual) notions in philosophy
and literature.  It is difficult (if not impossible and perhaps
purposefully so), so to speak, to separate the bird from the branch
(is that an expression, separate the bird from the branch?) and give a
totalizing definition of Deconstruction that is not tied directly to
its specific context(s) while in use.  This is exactly why it can be
so valuable to examine the meaning of the word in French; and by word
I mean: also the resonances that it has beyond its use in philosophy
and literary criticism:  its various homophones and homonyms, its
figural history, its roots and dissemination into the culture at large
etc.  What does a French speaker (such as Derrida) "hear" when using
the word "Deconstruction."  This is also useful for other concepts in
Derrida such as play.  Of course a precise definition of the word in
translation is not a definition of the concept or its use.

I very much like the metaphor of the building that is designed by its
inhabitants.  I think remodeling can be useful (although, I agree, not
an adequate translation!  Deconstruction is a much better translation
for Deconstruction) for a similar reason:  I think it's a common
misconception that Deconstruction means to undo or negate structure,
which, in my reading, is not the case.  Nice to be able to discuss
this.

Hi,
I was wondering if anyone knows who took over the official scholarship
of
Charles Olson after the death of George Butterick?

Also, what with the release in the past couple of year of the Daybooks
of Oppen
and the collected Notebooks of Frost, does anyone know of plans to mine
the Olson
collection at Storrs to produce a similar type of tome?

Thanks,
Ric

This sounds great too.  I played audio of 4 poems by Slavek at*couscous@sou=
ndeye
* this year, during the *SoundEye Festival of the Arts of the Word*.  The
first 3 poems was written in "a purely phonetic imaginary language," which
Slavek introduced as follows:

*When I left former-Czechoslovakia in 1986, I attempted to cross border in
mountains between Austria and Germany, that time called West Germany. I was
captured by German authorities and placed in camp for political refugees in
Schonau Am Konigsee in Alps. Only way to express myself was that time
writing; mainly poetry and drawing =96 i could not make music. I was writin=
g
in Czech language, but nobody would understand. My mother tongue became ver=
y
fast sort of redundant and also I was not able to write in any other
language. I entered in strange transition: i started to write in purely
phonetic imaginary language, I was focussed only on sounds and still keepin=
g
characteristic sounds of Czech language. I recorded 3 examples of such
poems, originally written 1986; there is no meaning except for tonal
qualities of spoken word. Since then I didn=92t write in this lingo.*


**

The 4th poem was a stunning *"reading scientific (Latin) names of beetles
from index of book.*"  There was a very strong response to Slavek's work: I
wish he could have been there in person.

Good luck with "tr=EDd an gcoill."

"Yes, Noise, or No," by  Brennen Wysong



Buy a wolf trap and a handkerchief. Purchase a wolf-proof door. You will
construct tiny cityscapes with bird bones inside snow globes. You will fill
the globes with a mixture of bits of tinsel and freshly ground pepper. The
wolves will in fact be wolfram. The warmth will be war. The theater will be
where the war will be waged. You, inchworm, will measure the marigolds. And
then, it will happen just like this: You will cover your body in a dull
dusting of wolfram, hoping someone will rub against you for warmth, hoping
you will bring brief shadow to a darkened theater, where the marigolds have
been ushered to their seats in the wings. The wings-and they are yours, of
course, attached to your back after losing your hands-will be read by X-ray
tubes using the wolfram. You will try to find tumult on the periodic table
of elements. It will be between flue and oxen. The theater will have no
stage. The devil will win by one. You will toss snow globes of Tehran into
an angry sea. Oxen, yes.

Jim,

"but, in poetry circles, godel and turing just do not compute, as you see in
the responses to this thread, which dealt with derrida, not godel and
turing.

and this is one of the reasons why poetry itself is isolated."

I have heard many reasons why poetry is isolated, but this is a new one.

"poetry, these days, needs to be an umbrella term for deep concerns of
language and art cross-stitched amongs many fields and modes of
perception/reception. for instance, the role of language in contemporary
mathematical logic is of philosophical significance and also has turned out
to be of very practical significance in that the work of godel and turing
led to the creation of the computer, that universal number+language
machine."

What exactly does the above passage mean, particularly the phrase "the role
of language in contemporary mathematical logic"?

"the philosophical underpinnings of the poetics of computation, of computer
art, can be strongly linked with the work of godel and turing and its
consequences concerning language, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and the
multimedial/intermedial."

As far as I can see, all you are saying here is that poetry is not poetry
unless related to Godel and Turing's work. That's quite a bit of a tall
order, don't you think, though I can understand their potential or realized
importance in some kind of poetry.

"poetry needs to be able to travel at the forefront of any field."

What does also this sentence mean, that poetry should become a kind of
supermench, the way opera was for Wagner?

Hi, Lily,

I never doubted the importance of such overtones in the original and their
loss in the translation. I only wanted to say that deconstruction, as it ha=
s
ended meaning in poetics and philosophy, is much more, beyond re-modeling.
It was trying to avoid decepive simplications.
I am glad you liked my metaphor of deconstruction being a building designed
by its inhabitants. It came to me on the spur of the moment.

Ciao,
Murat

interesting.
but i'm wary of the word forefront.
does poetry necessarily need to be ... there.

i'm happy to see it in the bleachers,
or with the cheerleaders.

really, i may have to re/read the esher/bach/GOD-el thing.
occassionally, it's fun to actually have something of a clue,or sort of know what i'm talking about. which, in my book, means ... Witt vs. Godel: it's a tie.

language and poetry after godel and turing.

but, in poetry circles, godel and turing just do not compute, as you see in the responses to this thread, which dealt with derrida, not godel and turing.

and this is one of the reasons why poetry itself is isolated.

poetry, these days, needs to be an umbrella term for deep concerns of language and art cross-stitched amongs many fields and modes of perception/reception. for instance, the role of language in contemporary mathematical logic is of philosophical significance and also has turned out to be of very practical significance in that the work of godel and turing led to the creation of the computer, that universal number+language machine.

the philosophical underpinnings of the poetics of computation, of computer art, can be strongly linked with the work of godel and turing and its consequences concerning language, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and the multimedial/intermedial.

poetry needs to be able to travel at the forefront of any field.

ROAMING READING - with Cara Benson
Cara Benson will walk Whitmanesquely among/through/within West Hollywood=E2=
=80=99s booths and books spouting bouts of words from her latest volume of =
prose poems (made). This in-situ situ includes, but is not limited to, insc=
ribing lines on land with colored chalk, embodying kinetic parataxis, and o=
therwise performing acts of high priestess trance-chant poetics. Subject to=
 turn on a dime.

LETTER WRITING DESK: ESCRITORIO PUBLICO - with Jen Hofer
The escritorio p=C3=BAblico is a public letter-writing desk most often set =
up on sidewalks in public space, though sometimes invited into museums, gal=
leries and other cultural spaces. The escritorio consists of a folding tabl=
e made by the man who built Jen=E2=80=99s house in 1920, on which she sets =
up her grandmother=E2=80=99s Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriter, writing paper =
and envelopes. She types letters in either Spanish or English for passers-b=
y, charging $2 for a letter, $3 for a love letter and $5 for an illicit lov=
e letter.=C2=A0 Escritorio p=C3=BAblico is an enactment of public practice,=
 an ethic of radical listening, and a manifestation of the gift economy.
Location: The Lounge on the Center of The Field

READING EXPERIMENT IN PROGRESS - with Jennifer Karmin
=E2=80=9CReading Experiment in Progress=E2=80=9D is an interactive performa=

not everyone has to be there, of course. poetry 'covers' many mentalities.
many 'mansions'.

the lights are pretty much off, though, in the poetry mansion and it's black
as night, concerning knowledge about things like the theory of computation,
Godel, and so forth. and folks are frightened: computer art is fascistic,
don't you know, and computers are to blame for the economic collapse, etc
etc. we can't be machines because that would mean it's all an empty
mechanical random concourse of atoms. and so on. people are frightened by
computers and computing in many ways, from the challenge they pose just in
how to use them in day to day life, to the 'threats' they pose to our
identity, to the role they sometimes play in art and poetry.

yet here we are using computers to talk about poetry. and using them to do
so many other things in our pursuit of poetry.

knowledge of things like the theory of computation not only can help dispel
fear--because the fear is mostly of the sort where we fear what we do not
understand--but, in matters of poetry, also provides us with, say,
approaches to language that can be useful in poetry and poetics.

also, the theory of computation and godel's work are fundamental to the
poetics of computation.

ha. yes i think it would be very pleasant to be with the cheerleaders in the
bleachers.

> really, i may have to re/read the esher/bach/GOD-el thing.

if yer after a hofstadter book, try 'i am a strange loop'. i'm finding that
one more readable. rebbeca goldstein's book called 'incompleteness' is good
on godel, his proof and biography (and friendship with einstein)--and also
concerning godel/wittgenstein. martin davis's book 'engines of logic' is an
instant classic in the 'history of ideas'. it looks at the life and work of
leibniz, boole, frege, cantor, hilbert, godel, and turing concerning the
development of the computer. it was leibniz's dream to create an 'aide to
human reason', which, he felt, required a language of symbolic logic. martin
davis is, himself, a renowned usamerican logician. his book is excellent on
the math and logic, on the history of ideas, in its biographical sketches,
and in its historical perspective. great book. another relevant book is the
oulipo compendium edited by harry matthews. oulipo started in 1960 and
is/was the first erm poetry movement or group or whatever to seriously cross
the borders of math and poetry. also, theirs is/was a kind of 'axiomatic'
approach that relates closely to mathematical logic. another inerestin book
is prehistoric digital poetry by chris funkhouser. this looks at digital
poetry from 1959 to 1995. basically pre-web. this mainly looks at the work
of the earlier poet-programmers.

ha. well, wittgenstein is still, of course, very influential in matters of
philosophy and even, somewhat, in literary matters. whereas godel's work
never really was, except in mathematical logic.

I would hope you're the only one who reads it that way, Murat. Cuz that's
not what I said. But, by now, how could I be surprised by your reading it
that way, considering that you've also said that computer art is fascistic
and that computers are to blame for the economic collapse. Computers,
computer art, and, possibly, computer artists seem to freak you out. I find
it hard to talk with you about these things cuz yer always jumping to this
sort of conclusion.

What I was saying is this. The work of Godel and Turing is fundamental to
the poetics of computation and computer art and the multimedial/intermedial
because it is fundamental to the theory of computation; and the theory of
computation is concerned with exploring the theoretical capabilities and
limitations of computing machines.

Turing invented the 'Turing machine', the 'abstract machine', the
mathematical model of a computing machine, to show that there are some tasks
that no computing machine can *ever* carry out. In other words, he invented
the modern computer to show that it has certain limitations. As opposed to
inventing it to get it to do stuff that couldn't be done otherwise. Which,
to me, is the sort of poetical thing that we see time and again in Godel's
and Turing's work.

Supermench? No. When we look at the impact of computing on language, we can
talk about it in many ways, can concentrate on different things. The way,
for instance, that the net crosses X with Y, brings ideas into contact with
one another, and, consequently, the languages associated with those ideas.
Or the way it brings media into contact with one another, by being capable
of representing all sorts of different media all on the same screen or in
the same machine; and, consequently, brings the languages both of and about
those media into contact with one another. Or the way it brings people into
contact with one another, being capable of representing communication
channels  (such as telephone) as well as traditional media like print,
recorded sound, and video/TV, etc.

The impact of computing on language is in all sorts of cross-fertilization
of language X with language Y, whether the languages are natural or other
types of languages.

Poetry is one of the fields that can use those energies expressively,
innovatively, in a way that captures the contemporary, and furthers our
understanding of what is happening to language(s) and us via computing.

Excerpt:
=20
CM: Where do you suppose the self-destructiveness trait comes from that occ=
urs in so many writers?
=20
HL: From frustration, as a consequence of marginalization, and from succumb=
ing to a dangerous set of culturally romanticized stereotypes. First, the f=
rustration and maginalization routes. A writer, particularly a poet, places=
 himself in an odd position in relation to dominant cultural value. A poet =
decides to value certain kinds of somewhat aimless, impractical, non-money-=
making activities, and he decides to make room and time in his life for the=
se activities. Furthermore, he=E2=80=99s apt to be pursuing a rather elusiv=
e mode of language =E2=80=93 not necessarily the direct, communicative, =E2=
=80=9Cuseful,=E2=80=9D commercially manipulative kind of language skill tha=
t society readily appreciates and rewards (in advertising, in journalism, a=
nd in other modes of persuasive and/or manipulative writing). So, what he=
=E2=80=99s doing with his time is aberrant =E2=80=93 hard to explain. And y=
et, if he is really engaged in a serious and profound relationship to poetr=
y, he does have certain sporadic validating experiences =E2=80=93 a sense o=
f connection to a longstanding human enterprise of considerable wisdom, joy=
, and pleasure. The self-destructiveness may arise as a gesture of anger an=
d frustration, arising from a sense that one=E2=80=99s primary life activit=
y is not appreciated or understood or respected. The self-destructiveness b=
ecomes an act oddly complicit with that ignoring and marginalizing by the s=
ociety at large, while it is also a somewhat desperate call for attention a=
nd significance.=20

> Join us for a reading celebrating the release of Alexander Long's =
limited-edition, artist-made chapbook Still Life, published as part of =
the Center for Book Arts' annual Poetry Chapbook program.  This year's =
chapbook was letterpress printed and hand bound by Barbara Henry in an =
edition of  100. Also available will be a letterpress chapbook by =
Terrance Hayes, Between Ghosts, designed and produced by Amber McMillan =
in an edition of 100. In addition, the Center is producing three =
limited-edition broadsides of poems by Jennifer Perrine, Deborah =
Flanagan, and Hadara Bar-Nadav. The four poets will read their work, =
joined by series organizers Terrence Hayes and Sharon Dolin.=20
>=20
> Alexander Long's manuscript was selected from a pool of 400 entries.  =
Terrance Hayes commented,"This imaginative collection had the wildly =
associative qualities of a poet bound to the past and present. His =
meditations on the likes of Malcolm X, Kafka and Lincoln combined the =
personal to the historical, the lyrical to the narrative. These poems =
made an immediate and enduring impression on me."

> This project comprises a series of original drawings and an artist =
book as well as an animated film.  Since 2003 Plate has been working on =
a series of 78 watercolor and pencil drawings inspired by the 78 cards =
of the traditional tarot. Clothespins have always played a key role in =
Plate's work and in this exhibition they become Clothespin Freaks; =
figures who, made of clear plastic clothespins, doll's body parts and =
sewn pieces, are the real heroes in this subversive Tarot adventure.  =
The installation features a new animated film, The Reading, which is a =
culminating artist project to this body of work.

Inside the Ghost Factory<http://www.marshhawkpress.org/Finkelstein2.htm>

Norman Finkelstein

Inside the Ghost Factory finds Norman Finkelstein returning to his pre-Trac=
k fascination with the Coleridgean fancy, first delineated in Restless Mess=
engers. Here, however, Samuel Coleridge meets William Gibson and the result=
 is a retro- Blakean myth for the age of Text and Tweet. These transmission=
s from "elsewhere," manufactured on the assembly lines of "Ghosts, Incorpor=
ated. Poetry, Incorporated" (Limited, I might add), are gleefully dissected=
 by Finkelstein as so much "clap-trap." Still, there's no correcting the bl=
ur of occultation and occlusion for the poet who believes "Books were made =
for secrets they cannot/keep: this is what it means to be/read."-Tyrone Wil=
liams
If Not for the Courage<http://www.marshhawkpress.org/Morris2.htm>
Daniel Morris

Everyday life in the household and memory of Daniel Morris's suburban Jewis=
h-professorpoet and father of toddlers has rarely been rendered with the en=
ergy, good humor, and luminous detail we meet in Daniel Morris's If Not for=
 the Courage. These poems are at once hilarious and heart-breaking; they ta=
ke us straight to the scene of the crime, allowing us to witness the most a=
bsurd and agonizingly funny moments of daily routine against the backdrop o=
f unrelieved media blitz. The courage of Morris's title is evident througho=
ut. -Marjorie Perloff

Sweetness

Chris Funkhouser and I were writing back and forth about riffs and I
realize I rarely use them, at least not consciously, since they tend to
repeat themselves uncomfortably; in any case, sweetness1 uses a riff one
way or another for a little song; in sweetness2, the riff's dissolved,
deconstructed, transformed, to no end, or one and another; just a little
guitar music dealing with a "theme" of sorts, maybe time for a hit tune
maybe.

New Writing Series presents:



A reading by Rachel Loden



Wednesday, October 6

4:30 pm

Visual Arts Performance Space

UC San Diego

Free



Sponsored by the Dean, Arts & Humanities Division and the Department of
Literature

Rachel Loden is the author of Dick of the Dead (Ahsahta Press), a finalist
for both the 2010 PEN USA Literary Award for Poetry and the California Book
Award. It was also one of the three most-cited books in Attention Span 2009
("a collectively-drawn map of the field"), landing on lists by Rae
Armantrout and others. The Washington Post's "Poet's Choice" column featured
a poem from the book and it has been called "oddly sublime" and
"intoxicating" by the Poetry Project Newsletter and "expansive and
whimsical" by the Brooklyn Rail. Loden's first book, Hotel Imperium
(Georgia), won the Contemporary Poetry Series competition and was selected
as one of the ten best poetry books of the year by the San Francisco
Chronicle, which called it "quirky and beguiling." It was also short-listed
for the Northern California Book Award. Loden has published four chapbooks,
including The Last Campaign (which won the Hudson Valley Writers' Center
chapbook competition) and The Richard Nixon Snow Globe (Wild Honey Press).
Her work has appeared or is forthcoming in New American Writing, Lana
Turner: A Journal of Poetry and Opinion, two editions of the Best American
Poetry series, Western Wind: An Introduction to Poetry, and many other
magazines and anthologies. Loden's microplay, "A Quaker Meeting in Yorba
Linda," was performed in New York as part of Plays on Words: A Poets Theater
Festival curated by Tony Torn, Lee Ann Brown and Corina Copp. She is the
recipient of a Pushcart Prize, a Fellowship in Poetry from the California
Arts Council, an &NOW Award, and a grant from the Fund for Poetry.

CHRIS FUNKHOUSER is a poet, scholar, and multimedia artist. In 2009, the
Associated Press commissioned him to prepare digital poems for the
occasion of Barack Obama's inauguration. He is author of the documentary
study, Prehistoric Digital Poetry: An Archaeology of Forms, 1959-1995, and
an eBook (CD-ROM), Selections 2.0. He currently teaches at New Jersey
Institute of Technology and University of Pennsylvania, is a Senior Editor
at PennSound, a member of the scientific review committee of the digital
literature journal regards crois?s (University of Paris 8), is on the
Advisory Board of the Digital Poetry Archive of Canada, and is an External
Collaborator with Ncleo de Ciberteatro, Insituto Politcnico do Porto
(Portugal). Since 1986 he has been an editor with We Press, with whom he
has produced poetry in a variety of media. A widely published author, he
was Visiting Fulbright Scholar at Multimedia University in Cyberjaya,
Malaysia (2006), on the summer writing program faculty of the Naropa
University (2007), and is presently Digital Poet-in-Residence at Bowery
Poetry Club (New York City).


ALAN SONDHEIM is our (all our) resident genius and provocateur. He is also
an important artist, theorist, code-worker, poet, musician, choreographer,
essayist, filmmaker, video-maker, performer and new-media innovator, who
has been working tirelessly and prolifically and with astonishing results
since before I was born. If youre lucky, you may be on one of his email
lists, which are the primary way he distributes his writing and other
work.

Sondheim has a new book of poetry out from Salt Press: DEEP LANGUAGE.
Maria Damon says it tangles us up in these hypnotically repetitive,
abject, slyly humorous and childishly gleeful, philosophically,
aesthetically, theoretically and psychologically dense and insightful
poems, that are also essays, diasporic riffs and incantations, true
confessions, Platonic dialogues, shtick, tantrums, aphorisms and
manifesti. John Cayley says he is one of the precious few who joyfully
and in abject misery  risks these terrors of writing for us, for our
pleasure and our undoing. What happens? Language disposes of us.

derrida does borrow another word from the construction industry -
subjectile. it refers to a surface before it is painted. if you do a google
search you'll find it used to describe priming, sanding, and finishing
products in the french dry-wall trades.

"What a beautiful set of circumstances! What a=20
lovely concatenation of particulars. Here is the=20
poet alive in every sense of the word, and=20
through every one of his senses. Instead of=20
missing a beat or a part, Weiss=92 fragments are=20
like Chekhov=92s short stories=ADthe more that gets=20
left out, the more they seem to contain=85 One can=20
hear echoes from all the various=20
ancestors...[but] the voice, at its center, its=20
core, is pure Mark Weiss. His use of the fragment=20
is both elegant and bafflingly clear, a pure=20
musical threnody=85[it] opens a window, not only=20
into a mind, but a person, a personality, this=20
human figure at the emotional center of the poem."

From: "Mark Weiss":
> To say that "Poetry is one of the fields that can
use those energies expressively, innovatively, in
a way that captures the contemporary, and
furthers our understanding of what is happening
to language(s) and us via computing" is far
different than proposing a "poetics of
computation." The latter reduces the concept of
poetics to nonsense. There are things in the
world that are simply different from each other.

How does the notion of poetics of computation "reduce the concept of poetics
to nonsense", Mark?

The notion of poetics of computation is certainly involved in philosophies
or poetics of computer art. Because what distinguishes computer art from
other types of art is a consequence of the computational capabilities of
computers, capabilities that aren't shared with other media or machines.

'Computer poetry', or whatever we call poetry that's specific to computing
media, is a type of computer art. Consequently, poetics of computation is
relevant to 'computer poetry'.

But, more generally, I think poetics of computation are relevant, in a
literary context, beyond poetry that's specific to computing media. Because
even if we're not making art that's specific to computing media, we're
interested in the special characteristics and properties of media that we
work with. Just like we're interested in philosophies that grow out of those
characteristics and properties.

Here's a very concrete example of how the theory of computation can be of
use in art and, therefore, to poetics of computation.

I remember reading someone quite well-known in computer poetry and media art
say that no machine can re-write its own code. But this is false. Computers
certainly are capable, given the appropriate programming, of re-writing
their own code. The writer perpetually came across as thinking that
computers are glorified typewriters or glorified tvs or stereos and so
forth. In other words, he came across as thinking that computers are
glorified traditional media devices. Now, if that's what somebody thinks,
then their expectations, concerning digital art, are going to be 'more of
the same'. More traditional art, just a bit different in gadgetry. However,
properly understood--and the theory of computation is very useful to a
proper understanding--computers are very far beyond simply being traditional
media devices in a different guise. They are radically flexible machines,
are flexible to the point that they can rewrite their own code, and there is
no proof and probably never will be that there exist thought processes of
which humans are capable and computers are not. In other words, computers
are likely, in theory, as flexible as *thought itself*. This sort of
understanding makes for higher expectations concerning computer art.

And surely also involve something we might describe as poetics of
computation.

Mark Young interviewed by Sheila E. Murphy at The Argotist Online:
http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/Young%20interview.htm
=20
=20
=20
Excerpt:=20
=20
Sheila E. Murphy: Your organizational and educational experiences seem to h=
ave contributed in a wide variety of ways, bringing on an artistic version =
of =E2=80=9Cdeferred compensation.=E2=80=9D Given your strong familiarity w=
ith the corporate world, the university environment, and the artistic spher=
e, please share your views on the possibility of bringing a wider range of =
people to poetry. Is this a fantasy, or is it possible in our current time?=
=20
 =20
Mark Young: Let me go out on a limb here & say I believe we have already ex=
ceeded the upper limits of the poetic macrocosm, but because there are no r=
egulations or restrictions, no fire marshalls standing at the entrances cou=
nting the numbers going in, it's going to keep on growing. For a while, any=
way.=20
 =20
Why has it grown so much? Population growth, obviously. More people, more p=
oets. A world made smaller by technology, & with English the lingua franca =
we are now seeing Indian & Chinese & Ghanian poets writing in a second lang=
uage as part of the everyday offerings. The exponential growth of publishin=
g methodology which means more books, more cheaply. More magazines=E2=80=94=
duotrope's digest has around 3000 outlets listed. The growth of MFA program=
s in creative writing=E2=80=94this is going to be one of the first areas to=
 go belly up. It's simple economics. People in these programs are trained o=
nly to become teachers of MFA programs in creative writing programs; there =
will soon be=E2=80=94if there isn't already=E2=80=94an oversupply of teache=
rs; demand for the programs will drop off because there's no guarantee of a=
 job on the other side; & bums on seats is the guiding principle of academi=
a these days.=20
 =20
So it may seem we have opposing points of view, you wanting to bring more p=
eople, me saying there are already too many. But I think we both have cavea=
ts attached, qualifiers perhaps; & what we're both moving towards is how do=
 we attract more people=E2=80=94whether already in the macrocosm or still t=
o come=E2=80=94to the type of poetry we care about, to that part of it we b=
oth adhere to.=20
=20
Let me step outside the sphere of poetics for a moment & quote from a book =
that is a cornerstone of my library, Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scienti=
fic Revolutions. In it Kuhn puts forward his beliefs as to why certain bodi=
es of thought, often exemplified by specific texts, provided the impetus to=
 change the way particular fields of science were pursued, the way what he =
called "paradigm shifts" came about:
=20
They were able to do so because they shared two essential characteristics. =
Their achievement was sufficiently unprecedented to attract an enduring gro=
up of adherents away from competing modes of scientific activity. Simultane=
ously, it was sufficiently open-ended to leave all sorts of problems for th=
e redefined group of practitioners to resolve.=20
 =20
I'll explain why I think Kuhn is relevant. To me, poetics, like politics, h=
as a reasonably revolutionary left wing & a conservative right. &, again li=
ke politics, it is the left that is full of schisms. Yet the left wing has =
a history as strong as that that the right professes to. But these days its=
 impact is diminished because it's splintered. I have fairly eclectic & wid=
e-ranging tastes, but when I came back to poetry I found that if I wanted t=
o read one group of poets I liked I had to go here, & if I wanted to read a=
nother group I had to go there, & another elsewhere, & if I wanted to see/r=
ead vispo, then I had to go searching in 100 places. & yet they're all esse=
ntially related even though sometimes the bloodlines are denied.  =20

Back to Kuhn. We have the "enduring group of adherents"; we have the open-e=
ndedness; what we don't have is a sense of the commonality that actually do=
es exist even though many practioners spend a deal of time turning the mino=
r differences into unbridgeable chasms. Somehow we have to bring things bac=
k together again, to show the breadth & the strength of the left even if th=
e house has many mansions. I think that by doing that we will attract a wid=
er & better-informed audience. It's what I've tried to do with Otoliths. [=
=E2=80=A6] I think I am succeeding in bringing things back together again, =
to show the breadth & the strength of the left even if the house has many m=
ansions.

My comment was about use of language, not about use of computers.

You seem to think that the words poetics,=20
philosophy and theory are interchangeable. They're not.

Moveable type and paper, together and separately,=20
created possibilities for poetry that hadn't=20

poetics of type? Does calling it in either case a poetics explain anything?

"the lights are pretty much off, though, in the poetry mansion and it's
black as night, concerning knowledge about things like the theory of
computation, Godel, and so forth. and folks are frightened: computer art is
fascistic, don't you know, and computers are to blame for the economic
collapse, etc etc. we can't be machines because that would mean it's all an
empty mechanical random concourse of atoms. and so on. people are frightened
by computers and computing in many ways, from the challenge they pose just
in how to use them in day to day life, to the 'threats' they pose to our
identity, to the role they sometimes play in art and poetry."

Jim,
As far as I can see the above are your words, not mine. I never said
computer art is fascistic. I may have said something like
"*computers*create fascistic possibilities" as they create also
possibilities for
chaos/and freedom and outreach. There is no doubt computers add a very
strong doze of instability to the world -as things may happen in lightening
speed- for good and evil. Because of computers our traditional ideal of
privacy is already undermined. If it chooses to, the state now has the
capability to know many things about ourselves -more than we ourselves care
remember- and one day can use that knowledge for subtle (or implicit)
blackmail (like having an internal inhibiting chip, so to speak). On the
other hand, the state computer gives a potent tool to the public at a
relatively cheap price. It facilitates asymmetrical conflict, etc. etc.
etc....

Computer is a double-edged sword as I said a number of times before. Its
ambiguous, high octane energy (its historically absolutely pivotal place)
makes it sublimely poetic. My work -as, if you had bothered to look at it
you would have discovered; as you know, I had made it available to you- is
saturated with references to machines and computers and the affinity
(basically spiritual, almost religious) between them and the human mind. The
poem *The Spiritual Life of Replicants* is about that relation and how it
affects consciousness, language and the concept of time. In other words, the
idea that I am "freaked," "scared" by computers is utter nonsense. I am
excited by it, its potent ambiguity.

To be blunt about it, my frustration with you is that you seem to be one of
those who know a lot and understand nothing. When I approached you in the
past with a philosophical, conceptual question about computers (questions
which have nothing to to symbolic logic, etc.), you answered with a software
software solution (use this program, do this, do that!) revealing to me that
even the import of my question is beyond your understanding.

I follow your work reasonably well, quite often checking the links you
mention on this list. When I wrote about your Angkor Wat piece about a year
ago, I attacked you because you basically knew nothing about the places
whose images you were appropriating for your own version of "surrealism,"
that those places were much more profoundly odd than your surrealism -and
the profound disjunctive effect that lack of knowledge was creating and that
you were not even aware of this moral/philosophical and finally aesthetic,
in other words, poetic failure.

Ciao,

Murat

or, as Bill Knott once said in a poem:

A kite in the shape
of a map floats
over the land it depicts


We begin our lecture with a little conceit, in Tallahassee.
Godel has been appointed a chair in their Math department
( Dirac, the great Austrian nobel phys/ taught there)

Godel says to his class,
does Florida State rule???

( back in the day/ 14 consecutive top 5 finishes. Today, don't ask.)

& if Florida State don't rule, how that?
By competing with themselves?

Or by Playing ANOTHER TEAM....................................

'Responding to Dana Gioia's, "Can Poetry Matter?"' by Jake Berry at The Arg=
otist Online

http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/Berry%20essay%202.htm


Excerpt:

Gioia seeks alternatives in the past, in how previous generations of poets =
managed to survive when their principle occupation could not sustain them. =
This is a valuable examination and it certainly bears consideration. And th=
ere are examples even today of poets surviving, and working, beyond the aca=
demic culture. Yet almost none of them are accepted as valid by that domina=
nt culture. Hank Lazer made a strong argument in this regard in the two vol=
umes of his Opposing Poetries. Those poetries being the academic, writing s=
chool poetry, which he calls "plainverse", and the, at that time, up and co=
ming avant-garde which generally falls under the term 'language' poetry. Re=
garding this, it seems the academy has found a solution to revolt by taking=
 a lesson from the markets of the 1970s. Rather than resist the burgeoning =
"revolution" against complacency and materialism it simply devoured it in t=
he name of style and fashion and sold the trappings=E2=80=94the clothes, ha=
ircuts, and symbology=E2=80=94in a slightly refined form to the culture at =
large. The result was the decadence of the late 1970s and 1980s. Similarly,=
 the academy has begun to absorb some of the language poets, often over the=
 strenuous objection of the writing school poets, and has thereby transform=
ed the avant-garde into a codified, institutionally verified avant-garde th=
at can be taught (marketed) to a growing, though less popular, subculture. =
One can imagine a time (is that time already here?) when in order to be acc=
epted as an avant-garde poet a young writer would be required to have a mas=
ters and possibly a doctorate in the avant-garde formula of the day. In suc=
h a condition anything genuinely avant-garde would be utterly dismissed, ma=
rginalized to the point of invisibility.

> & there's Ellen Myles (spelling???), doing her lesbian thing, looking good in that brown pant suit thing she's wearing

Dear Mr. Russell:

If you were able to tell that Ms. Myles was a lesbian from whatever
she was doing ("lesbian things," after all, include brushing one's
teeth), then I am baffled as to why you would think she cares about
your opinion of that "pant suit thing." I find your thing to be a
creepy misogyny thing. Some of us female things do not actually dress
for your male gaze. (And no, your having described the appearance of
Mr. Downs in the preceding paragraph thing does not let you off the
hook for slyly making us guess at whom you mean by "Ugh/liest." It's a
societal thing.)

Plus five points for clever use of the space bar. Minus several
million for the visual evaluation thing. And who am I to be grading
your things? That, my dear sir, is precisely my point thing.

Sincerely,
Short Fat Obscure Poet Thing

It was such a shock to see this email.Michael was my professor and then thesis
advisor at Brown. I knew him not only as a wonderful poet, but as a great guy
and an encouraging, supportive teacher. He was really very generous, and I'm
left wishing I'd been able to give more to him in return and to have known him
better. My thoughts are very much with his family and loved ones. This is really
very sad news.

Half Measures

This being a democracy,
one should resemble a description,
and not a rumor to oneself.

Na=EFve to think relationships are equal.
Human nature is a public nuisance,
humanity a bully after all.

Are you experienced?
Does water experience the ocean?
Freedom's useless if you can't eat.

The world is enormous,

then you leave the house.

There's too much to say about Michael Gizzi
He was fun. He did so much for me.
The first poem of his that struck me was called "Possum's Creed"
(one day he called to tell me he was singing "The Farmer In The Deli")
He wore the badge of high art lighter than most (does that sound =20
pretentious---ugh).
At times wickedly cynical. Glint eyes
(try to hide your deep suffering by whatever means necessary).
Often in a tandom.
John Yau and he were running buddies, verbal sparring partners when I =20=

first met him
(circa 90?). Also, he and Clark Coolidge (when CC and I both lived =20
near Michael).

Even when he was bed-ridden in the mid-90s, he was one of those guys who
could really HOLD COURT as it were from his bed; Barbeio (sp?) and her =20=

amazing
art was around a lot then--he'd play Basement Tapes & a lot of James =20
Brown
(he was into James Booker too).
Going to see Dylan at Tanglewood with him and Clark Coolidge was a trip
(Clark kept on saying, "he better not play that religious stuff." =20
Michael
laughed at me mischeviously; he not-so-secretly was hoping Dylan would
(more so to piss CC off probably---the lord works in mysterious way;
just like a real Italian kid). & Shakespeare plays. Michael & Ashbery

There's too much to say about Michael; and I know I've only scratched =20=

the surface.
I haven't made it back east for almost a decade; but we became =20
facebook friends in the last year.
We wrote a few comments on each other's walls....

I too was shocked. I've known Michael as both a friend and colleague for
about 5 years. We lost touch in recent years. I'm deeply saddened by this
news, and have felt all day that I should have done more to keep up with
him. Michael always had the best edits, the best words: he certainly wasn't
a bullshitter by any means. He told me always what I needed to hear, even if
I didn't exactly know what that was. I consider him central to my
development as one who thinks, writes, and views films (Mike introduced me
to Antonioni, and to Russian Ark).

I'm not expecting this feeling to pass quickly, and my heart and thoughts
certainly go out to his friends and family.

You will be missed, Mike.

I agree with you, Chris: there's so much.  Michael was the editor of my =
first book, from Hard Press, and I really believe that were it not for =
him I'd probably still be shopping it around.  I'm sure there are many, =
many similar stories about him.

Goddess bless him.  Again.
