I don't find "Women and Honor" amazing.
I think that it is clear and logical and beautifully written

"This is why the effort to speak honestly is so important. Lies are =
usually attempts to make everything simpler =96 for the liar =96 than it =
really is, or ought to be."

I find that very clear and cannot think of a better way to say it.

with Gina Frangello, Cris Mazza, Susan Solomon,
Charles Blackstone, A D Jameson & Davis Schneiderman

A celebration for the new anthology Men Undressed: Women Writers and the Ma=
le Sexual Experience published by Other Voices Books.  In this collection, =
women writers imagine all things sexual from the point of view of male char=
acters.

GINA FRANGELLO is the author of three books of fiction: A Life in Men (Algo=
nquin Books, 2013), Slut Lullabies (Emergency Press 2010) and My Sister's C=
ontinent (Chiasmus 2006).  The longtime editor of the literary magazine, Ot=
her Voices, she co-founded its book press, Other Voices Books, in 2004 and =

itor on the online cultural site, The Rumpus.=20

CRIS MAZZA has authored sixteen books, most recently Various Men Who Knew U=
s as Girls, a novel.  Her other fiction titles include Waterbaby, Trickle-D=
own Timeline, and Is It Sexual Harassment Yet?  In 1995 & 1996, Mazza was c=
o-editor for the original Chick-Lit anthologies: Chick-Lit: Postfeminist Fi=
ction, and Chick-Lit 2: No Chick Vics.  In 2006, her essay =E2=80=9CWho=E2=
=80=99s Laughing Now: Chick Lit and the Perversion of a Genre,=E2=80=9D exp=
laining the co-opting and corrosion of the title, appeared in Poets & Write=
rs Magazine.  In addition to fiction, Mazza also has published a collection=
 of personal essays, Indigenous: Growing Up Californian, and has a hybrid m=
emoir, Something Wrong With Her, forthcoming from Jadid Ibis Press.  A nati=
ve of Southern California, Mazza grew up in San Diego County.  She currentl=
y lives 50 miles west of Chicago and is a professor in the Program for Writ=
ers at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  She can be found online at
 www.cris-mazza.com.

SUSAN SOLOMON is a writer and lawyer living in Chicago. Her fiction is upco=
ming or has appeared in a number of online and print publications including=
 Valparaiso Fiction Review, Polluto, Wilderness House Literary Review, and =
Pebble Lake Review. Her story, "Smile Catchers," placed "Commended" (top te=
n) in Writelink's 2004 Weekender Challenge (United Kingdom), and her story,=
 "Medici, For Beginners," was selected as an Editor's Choice story for 2005=
 by Pulse Magazine.

CHARLES BLACKSTONE is the author of The Week You Weren't Here, a novel, and=
 co-editor of The Art of Friction, an anthology of genre-defying fiction an=
d creative nonfiction, and managing editor of the acclaimed book review sit=

The Evergreen Review, Modern Luxury, Wall Street Journal.com, Esquire.com, =
and, most recently, on Twitter. He lives in Chicago.

A D JAMESON is the author of the prose collection Amazing Adult Fantasy and=
 the novel Giant Slugs (both 2011). His work has appeared in Conjunctions, =
Denver Quarterly, Fiction International, The Brooklyn Rail, and dozens of o=
ther journals. He also contributes regularly to the group blogs Big Other a=
nd HTMLGiant. Last fall, he entered the PhD program in Creative Writing at =
UIC.=20

DAVIS SCHNEIDERMAN's recent novels include Drain (TriQuarterly/Northwestern=
), which did not win the National Book Award, and Blank: a novel (Jaded Ibi=
s), with audio from Dj Spooky, which was not a finalist for the Pulitzer Pr=
ize. His creative work has never appeared in The New Yorker, Harper=E2=80=
=99s, The Paris Review and Granta. He has not been the recipient of three P=
ushcart Prizes for his short fiction, and has never been a fellow at Breadl=
oaf or Yaddo. Recently, he was passed over for a MacArthur =E2=80=9CGenius=
=E2=80=9D Grant, despite being Chair of the English Department at Lake Fore=
st College, and also Director of Lake Forest College Press/&NOW Books, wher=
e he co-edits The &NOW AWARDS: The Best Innovative Writing.

***MAY 5th @ 7pm***
Experiment #54: The Rhythm is Gonna Getcha
with H. V. Cramond, Heather Momyer & Matias Viegener

The possibility that if all writers and readers are formed by situations of=
 chance, then control, even in terms of authorship and readership, is an il=
lusion.  What if choice is an illusion?  Bring your dancin=E2=80=99 shoes.

H. V. CRAMOND is a Writing Instructor at Loyola University Chicago and is t=
he Poetry Editor for Requited Journal for Innovative Art. She holds an MFA =
in Writing from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and has received=
 grants from the Illinois Arts Council and Community Arts Assistance Progra=

tly reads for XYZ Festival of New Works at About Face Theatre and for Pegas=
us Players' Young Playwrights Festival. Some recent work can be found in So=
undless Poetry, Keep Going, Wunderkammer, and Ignavia and forthcoming in de=
ath hums.

HEATHER MOMYER lives in Chicago and teaches at Columbia College and Loyola =
University; however, as of this summer, she will begin the Medill journalis=
m program at Northwestern University. Her writing appears in journals such =
as Bluestem, Popular Culture Review, Exquisite Corpse, Ekleksographia, and =
Dark Sky Magazine. New work is forthcoming in Puerto del Sol.

MATIAS VIEGENER is an artist, author and critic who teaches at CalArts. He'=
s a founder of the art collective Fallen Fruit, which has exhibited interna=
tionally in Mexico, Colombia, Denmark, Austria (Ars Electronica), LACMA, th=
e Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, and ARCO 2010 in Madrid. He writes regul=

abinet, Journal of Aesthetics & Protest, Radical History Review, and Black =
Clock, and co-edited The Noulipian Analects and S=C3=A9ance in Experimental=
 Writing. His book of experimental fiction, 2500 Random Things About Me, To=
o is just out from Les Figues Press.

ent is designed as a reading experiment with participation by local, nation=
al, and international writers, artists, and performers. The series was foun=

Hi all.
For National Poetry Month=2C I'll be blogging daily about why the commons m=

Here's an excerpt:I do believe that poetry is vital to everyone=2C but not =
in this trickle-down manner reminiscent of Reagan economics.* Poetry=2C I a=
rgue=2C is of the commons and for the commons and cannot be usurped by the =

I'd be happy to have you join my discussion=2C and I'd love to hear what ot=

A Poem by Stephen Bunch

Stephen Bunch lives and writes in Lawrence, Kansas, where he received the
2008 Langston Hughes Award for Poetry from the Lawrence Arts Center and
Raven Books. His poems can be found in Autumn Sky Poetry, The Externalist,
The Literary Bohemian, Fickle Muses, and Umbrella.

From 1978 to 1988, he edited and published Tellus, a little magazine that

Levering, Denise Low, Paul Metcalf, Edward Sanders, and many others.

After a fifteen-year hibernation, he awoke in 2005 and resumed writing.
Preparing to Leave, his first gathering of poems, was published in 2011.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The lectures

in The Poetry Collection, at SUNY Buffalo in order to explore
community/discourse formations, the status of ephemera and the making of
genre, the conditions of literary production, transatlantic
cross-pollinations in and between specific magazines, the careers of poets,
the role of book art, and how the little magazine functions in the making
of the avant-garde.

Small Press in the Archive lectures are FREE and Open to the Public*

Greetings, readers! This is April, known in the United States as
National Poetry Month. That means the worst of our nation's poetry is on
display, leading underground poets to whine about how no one loves them
and academic poets to pretend to hate their readership, which they
probably would if it wasn't imaginary. Clearly, the only way out of such
literary despair is to embrace sociopolitical despair, so come check out
the new issue of UnlikelyStories.org, with:

Starhawk starts a "green entrepreneurship program" of education in
Bayview Hunters Point, an impoverished neighborhood of San Francisco
"At the Crossroads of Climate and Food" by Seattle Councilman Richard Conlin
Jerel C. Wilmore films a peaceful protest at Virginia's Capitol Square
and police response
Rev. John Helmiere describes being beaten by Oakland police
Phil Rockstroh on police repression, official mendacity and why OWS has
already overcome
"The Spa Owner's Family," a novella by Dirk van Nouhuys
Short Fiction by Tom Bonfiglio, George Sparling, and Bruce Memblatt
and New Poetry, involving the visual, the experimental, the offbeat and
the aggressive by Lawrence Welsh, B. Z. Niditch, Wendy Taylor Carlisle,
Felino A. Soriano, Ric Carfagna, Jacob A. Bennett, Lizzy Swane, Nicholas
Komodore, Alia Vancrown and Marc Thompson

We'll have a new multimedia issue up mid-month, and then a mini-issue
for early May -- I'll be working on the next issue of BigBridge.org in
the latter half of this month. Our regular publication schedule will
resume with another multimedia issue in mid-May.

Love and ennui,

COURSE LIST / CYCLE 2

ADVANCED MACARONICS: NEOLOGY, SUBJECTIVITY AND THE PROBLEM OF PERSUASION
 Big words, complicated word, a little Latin here and there&#8230; All of t=
hese  can be used to advantage in business, public and personal life. This =
 course covers linguistically informed neologism that can be utilized as  r=
hetorical devices for everyday life.=A0 Students are expected to research  =
word origins to form a personal patois for use in conversation,  critical a=
nd creative writing
 Digressor: Angela Genusa
  CATABOLIC POIESIS
 In biology the term catabolic refers to the breaking down of complex  subs=
tance into simpler ones, with a release of energy. In rhetoric and  poetics=
 we can use this term to indicate the breaking down of epic  works, long po=
ems, and analects into a simpler, unified form through  reductive prosody. =
In this class we will explore methods for  constructing post or anti litera=
ry tables rather than texts and  terse-verse that may or may not be embodie=
d as a single image (after  all, a picture is worth a thousand words)
 Digressor: Talan Memmott
  COMMUNICATIONS 101: FROM SOOTHSAYING TO TELEPHONY
 Building upon the idea of descrying messages, meanings, and patterns,  thi=
s course will survey the communication landscape, from prophecy,  communica=
tion with other versions of reality (ex., as surrealism does),  to communic=
ation mediated by digital telephony.
 Digressor: Catherine Daly
  CONFISUON: LOST IN LANGUAGE, A TAUTOLOGY
 The Letterist (& later Situationist) International made an  art of d=E9riv=
e, which might be understood [practiced] as [by]  intentionally getting los=
t in the urban landscape. Today, the Web helps  us remain lost at all times=
: D=E9rive is ever a click away. But we are  always already confused the mo=
ment we approach the world (&/or the  WWW) with language, which finds tract=
ion in its own slippage (cf.  Lacan&#8217;s notion of point de capiton ). T=
he Web is language-based  tautological space [which describes itself], just=
 as a jpeg is made of  [unread?] language-in-relation. What happens when we=
 [take/make a]  d=E9rive [w/in] language itself, confusing a confusion [of =
signs]? Is it  possible to get lost on a d=E9rive, to drift from the drift?=
 #confisuon  confisuon.tumblr.com
 Digressor: Jeff T. Johnson
  THE CONGRUENCY OF POETICS AND POP CULTURE: DISCOURSE OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE=
, SOPHIA COPPOLA, AND AL PACINO
 The idea of congruency, and for that matter,  incongruence of all things q=
uotidian, poetic, pop culture, Sophia  Coppola, is at a particular schism a=
nd asymmetry, and it is a conundrum  that must be solved. With the assistan=
ce of the following, I hope that  we can bring a controlled chaos to said c=
ongruency and incongruence,  wild scrum. Here are some aids that we will be=
 using: film: Mary  Antoinette, Godfather III, The Virgin Suicides, Lost in=
 Translation,  Somewhere, et al; text: Roland Barthes&#8217; Mourning Diary=
, Maggie Nelson&#8217;s  Bluets, Glassner&#8217;s The Culure of Fear, Breck=
enridge&#8217;s A Young Girl in  Passing, Powell&#8217;s Cocktail and Chron=
ic, Creely; music: NWA, The Cockney  Rejects, Ramones, Partisans, Public En=
emy, et al. In addition to these  aid, we will be focusing on much photogra=
phy: Sherman, Friedlander,  Weegee, et al.=20
 Digressor: Ray DeJes=FAs
  DISKINETICS: INNER YOGA, MENTAL GYMNASTICS, AND METAPHYSICAL EDUCATION
 Fulfill your metaphys-ed requirement and flex your soul by studying  menta=
l gymnastics and inner yoga with certified yoga instructor Claire
 Donato. Students will watch and respond to workout videos, participate  in=
 acrobatic visualization exercises, and look into the brain&#8217;s
 locomotives. This course emphasizes relaxation and mental energy over  mus=
cular strength. The most limber-minded students will win a
 Provisional Meta-Fitness Award.
 Digressor: Claire Donato
  EDIBLE AVATARS, ANOREXIA, AND FALSE ACCUSATION: THE THEORETICAL BASES OF =
HOLOGRAPHIC FUTURES AND MELANCHOLIA
 Edible avatars succumb to anorexia; prims have little or no body of  cours=
e, although avatars might be accused of just about anything,  including. Ho=
lographic objects have no weight and that makes them sad;  if you&#8217;re =
a tree in a forest you can&#8217;t hear an avatar crying in any  case.
 Digressor: Alan Sondheim
  HAPTIC TELEPATHIES AND DIVINATION
 Course description will be posted soon
 Digressor: Linus Lancaster
  INTERROGATING JUTE: ADVENTURES IN MACRAME
 CANCELED due to severe global jute shortage
  JUICY TIMELINESS AND SUBLIME ANTI-TECHNICS
 To balance the downward drive of &#8220;Underwater Procrastination and  Ad=
vanced Desublimation Techniques,&#8221; I will be giving several creative  =
prompts in the direction of &#8220;Juicy Timeliness and Beginning Sublime  =
Anti-technics.&#8221; As timeliness is also timelessness, beginning is a  p=
erpetual state of mind ardently to be desired, and anti-technics is  simply=
 a form of technics, we should continue to have a lot of fun and  blow each=
 others&#8217; minds with gooey, bouncy and gushy cultural artifacts  the l=
ikes of which have never been seen before.
 Digressor: Maria Damon
  N&#332; CODE (DEPROGRAMMING 101)
 Week 1: View page source. Stare at page source. Line after line. Your eyes=
, the code. Paper cranes, undulating glass.
 Week 2: &#8220;A code will be shown without the picture.&#8221; Load code,=
 turn  off screen. Rediscover uncodifiable mystery of the black box, its  i=
lluminations.
 Week 3: Travel path of the N&#333; coder, blind monk of a digital age,  de=
programmer of restless interactivity. Record results. Codify. Compile.
 Week 4: GOTO Week 1
 Digressor: Eric Snodgrass
  =0F&#8220;OH, LOOK, A HYPNOTIZED CHICKEN!=0F&#8221;: COMPOSITION AND DIST=
RACTION
 This course will examine ways of composing poetry and prose through  embra=
cing (=0F&#8220;try to look a chicken in the eye with great intensity=0F&#8=
221;) what  it means to be a distracted (Japanese Fart Scrolls=0F&#8212;Ali=
en Conspiracy?)  writer as well as (the recalled brands of dog) developing =
an awareness  (hallucinated the lady in the radiator) of one=0F&#8217;s con=
sciousness. We will  also explore using PostFlarfian Oulipian techniques (f=
our 7-eleven  microwaves, presets blinking) so there will be elements of th=
at factored  (craving a cold anubis sandwich=0F&#8212;yum!!!) into the cour=
se (Online  Pharmacy No Prescription Haloperidol 5 Mg). Those registering f=
or this  course may even learn to hypnotize a chicken (Longmont Potion  Cas=
tle+rorschach trampstamps).
 Digressor: Angela Genusa
  SPACE, PLACE AND DIGITAL BITS: WHERE THE HELL ARE WE ANYWAY?
 Ground control to Major Tom, put your spacesuit on. In Space, Place and  D=
igital Bits we will explore the idea of location in the digital age by  bec=
oming modern day urban/suburban/rural archeologists of our  digi-embodied s=
ites. This un-course will guide students in exploring the  space and place =
around them with readings, films, web stuff and  directive actions that req=
uire the un-student to move, listen, revel in  their digital and ephemeral =
bodies. The physical/un-physical embodied  self will play an active role in=
 the formation of figuring out where the  hell we are. And most importantly=
 of all time- we will make things that  are here, there, everywhere, nowher=
e and just are!

Dear all=2C with apologies for cross-posting=2C

This is announcing the launch of a new ongoing series=2C Land Diagrams - ht=
tp://landdiagrams.wordpress.com/ . This pairs poets=2C writers and thinkers=
 from different disciplinary backgrounds in writing responses to the same t=
opographical image. So far it includes new pieces by the poets Mark Dickins=
on=2C Peter Larkin and Giles Goodland=2C paired respectively with cartograp=
hic historian Mark Monmonier (Coastlines: How Mapmakers Frame the World and=
 Chart Environmental Change)=2C environmental researcher Owain Jones (Tree =
Cultures: The Place of Trees and Trees in Their Place) and spatiality theor=
ist Martin Dodge (The Atlas of Cyberspace). Future contributors will includ=
e Lisa Robertson paired with a meteorologist and James Wilkes paired with a=
 geologist.=20

It aims to find a new way for specialist discourses about topography=2C and=
 tacit knowledge about the different systems in the landscape=2C to interse=
ct through ekphrasis. The found images (charts=2C schemes=2C scores=2C comp=
uter codes) prompt two simultaneous articles - but the writers don't commun=
icate or consult each other. The aim is to focus on a divergence of thought=
=2C practice and resources=2C rather than the potential middle-grounding of=
 a collaboration.

New items will be added regularly to the series - do let me know at amycutl=
er1985@gmail.com if you'd like to contribute=2C suggest an image=2C or sugg=
est a writer - or if you have any feedback. It'd be appreciated if you coul=
d disseminate LAND DIAGRAMS to other disciplines / interested parties too.=

The Claudius App, an online journal of negative reviews and poems, is now
accepting submissions for its third issue, deadline June 5th.  The second
issue, an avant-post-Fordist labor product digitally congealed at
www.theclaudiusapp.com, included work by or attributed to: Sara Deniz
Akant, Brian Ang, Jerimee Bloemeke, Feng Sun Chen, Patrick James Dunagan,
Pierre Klossowski, Purdey Kreiden, Ben Lerner, Mark Levine, Anthony Madrid,
Jessica O Marsh, Chris Martin, Jeff Nagy, Tim Shaner, Josh Stanley, Jonty
Tiplady, Cathy Wagner, Elisabeth Workman, and your dreams, with a splash by
Ian Hatcher.  Send fast poems, negative reviews, and letters with a
self-addressed stamped brick for your manuscript's eternal return, or query
editors@theclaudiusapp.com for more information.

Private lives are just that and your private eyes are something else, but
as long as the private's on tour there is no private art.  In the land of
the blind, the man with one eye is not lacking for employment
opportunities.  And we all know the workers don't need any lessons from the
students any less than the lessons themselves.  What estate are we at
anyway?

Reader, do I make you litigious?  You're already no longer young forever,
so gas the giant up and philosophize with your hummer.  "How stupid are
you?  Don't you know these people are rich?"  Well, I came for the
credential and stayed for the canapes, totally over paying my lap service
for a limp sum.  A desire a bargain basement thou shalt have it sort of
thing.

I always knew that licorice tasted like assholes even before I'd tasted an
asshole so imagine my total lack of surprise when I turned out to be
right.  The primary mortal deficiency remains art in all its forms.  The
secondary vice we'll negotiate at the convention.  Strap on your EZ-Pass
and meet us on the bridge.

All of you know my adherance to rhyming poetry, but every so often a topic =
comes along where the rhyme does not fit, it jarrs too much with the topic,=
 and one such issue is the Greek pensioner Dimitrius Christoulas who shot h=
imself dead on an Athens square this week, his pension cut to such a dregre=
e foraging in bins is his only option.

My latest poem on YouTube is a tribute to this man, the first verse of whic=
h I publish below.


=0A          =0A        =0A          =0A          =0A    =0A       =20

We watch from afar, we hear a name
=0AChristoulas may as well be a football player to most
=0ABut its ironic before Easter
=0AAnother Christ lies dead - this one wont rise
=0AAfter three days, this temple torn down
=0AWill stay forever as rubble...

The death of Dimitirs Christaupolos shows the callous effect that =0Afinanc=
e has on ordinary decent people. This man refused to be reduced to=0A scave=
nging from bins, at a time when his own government begged and =0Aachieved b=
ailouts and writedowns, no benefit was shown to their own =0Apeople, this o=
ne of whom we know by the public nature of his death.

A=0A student in Prague immolated himself in 1968, inspired a generation to =
=0Astand up to Soviet oppression. Today, a 77 year old pensioner kills =0Ah=
imself to inspire his nation to save itself from the greed of the =0Abanker=
s who care only for profits and bonuses as their nation is =0Adestroyed.

This poem is non rhyming, one of the few Ive written, the tragedy of it mad=
e it beyond rhyme for me.

It is a suggestion that every poet to this listserve should write a tribute=
 poem to this man, and the thousands of others, many in my own land, unknow=
n because they took their lives in private due to the financial pressures b=
rought about by the banks.

Now out from Otoliths.



*American Ghazals*

Sheila E. Murphy

68 pages

Otoliths, 2012

ISBN: 978-0-9872010-2-7

$14.45 + p&h

URL: http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/american-ghazals/18929550



The ghazal is a time-honored literary form dating from 6th century Arabic
verse. Successive versions of the form attest to its appeal across numerous
cultures and periods of time. Focal themes associated with the form have
encompassed divine and earthly love to those of loss, longing, and
isolation. Ghazals are voiced and sung in many languages, including
Persian, Turkish, and Urdu.



Despite highly specific rules governing the form in its early centuries,
more contemporary versions have relaxed such practices. In contemporary
English, the self-containment of each couplet offers an appealing potential
for discovering subtle relationships among the (minimum of five) different
couplets within a single piece. Subliminal echoes of perception and
emergent contextual linkages provide a renewal of sensibility for readers
of the ghazal.



The pieces in this collection represent a selection of works written as
=91American Ghazals,=92 based upon the distinctly American idiom in which t=
he
pieces have been developed. The more I read the form in translation and in
English, the more apparent the fit of pivotal shifts in language, thought,
and content. The American ghazal offers rich practice, replete with
political, social, psychological, and meditative states that redefine
perceptions in a new century.

 "I understand Jared Hayes is conducting here a deep spelunking into
connected caverns of other texts. What I don't yet quite grasp is how he's
articulated all the ropes, quickdraws, carabiners, hexes, cams, and sundry
poetical devices to work in such syntactically spectacular ways. 'I root up
(I have brought them) landinwards, hither (I will make them resound here.)'
And that's just at the first drop, barely in, still fathoms to go.... Well,
some people have the ambition and guts and others just watch. I could say
'tour de force' from my spectator chair, but that wouldn't really do. So
I'll say, as a first handle on it, that THE DEAD LOVE joins the
masterpieces of John Cage, Jackson Mac Low, Susan Howe, and Ronald Johnson
as one of the most exhilarating 'citational' explorations ever made in
American poetry."=97Kent Johnson

Jared Hayes lives in Portland, Oregon. He believes collectivity and
community are important and so is a member of Dusie Kollectiv, Black Radish
Books, and Livestock Editions. Jared's poems can be found.

AND:

Infinite Variations
Marci Nelligan
*
*
*
http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9780982573181/infinite-variations.aspx


Composed from source text randomly selected from *On the Origin of the
Species* and the Old Testament, INFINITE VARIATIONS seeks to puncture the
political in exploring and re-imagining these seminal texts. Splicing cell
structure with the numinous, it careens, stutters, and reinvents.

"Using phrasing and vocabulary from the Old Testament and Darwin's *On the
Origin of the Species*as her raw material, Nelligan creates startlingly
fresh structures, contemporary in their vigorous parataxis and suspension
of normative logic, timeless in their explorations of origin and,
ultimately, of being. But above all, there's a marvelous mix of delight and
gravity in the way she wields these words, letting sound and association
create bridges across epochs and disciplines. An extremely promising first
book, at once intimate and immense, luminous and lively."=97Cole Swensen

"INFINITE VARIATIONS takes two loaded and locked works=97*On the Origin of
the Species* and the Old Testament=97and uses them in allegiance to an
exploration of desire. Each word is, thus, resonant, full of debate. It is
a defense of evolution's role in love and about a love of evolution's
variations. Throughout it is provocative in its simplicity, luminous in its
word play."=97Juliana Spahr

Marci Nelligan's publications include chapbooks *Dispatch* (with Nicole
Mauro), *Infinite Variations*, and *The Book of Knowledge*, all from Dusie
Press. In addition, she was the co-editor of an interdisciplinary book on
Jane Jacobs, INTERSECTION, from Chain Links Press. Her work has appeared in
*Jacket*, DENVER QUARTERLY, *The New Orleans Review*, *How2*, and other
journals. She was the 1999 recipient of Poets & Writers "Writers-on-Site"
grant and has an MFA from Mills College in poetry. She teaches creative
writing at Franklin & Marshall College and lives in Lancaster,
Pennsylvania, with her husband and two daughters.

Street, New York. Pamela Lu and Mónica de la Torre. See
http://poetryproject.org/program-calendar/pamela-lu-monica-de-la-torre.html
for details.

Friday, April 27, 7:00 PM at the Asian American Writers' Workshop, 112
West 27th Street, Suite 600, Between 6th and 7th Avenues in Manhattan,
Buzzer 600. $5.00 suggested donation. Subterranean Technologies: The
Ambient Poetics of Tan Lin, Pamela Lu, and Sueyeun Juliette Lee.
Moderated by Dorothy Wang and live-tweeted by Lucy Ives. See
http://www.aaww.org/#27apr12 for more details.

Pamela Lu is the author of the books /Ambient Parking Lot/ (Kenning
Editions, 2011) and /Pamela: A Novel/ (Atelos, 1999), as well as the
chapbook /The Private Listener/ (Corollary Press, 2006). Her writing
also appears in the anthologies /Bay Poetics/ and /Biting the Error/,
and has been published in periodicals such as /1913/, /Antennae/,
/Call/, /Chain/, /Chicago Review/, /Fascicle/, /Harper's/, /Mirage/,
/Poetics Journal,/ and /Tinfish/. She grew up in Southern California,
and now lives and works in the San Francisco Bay Area.

/Ambient Parking Lot/ is a 187-page book about one band's quest to
capture the world's most perfect ambient noise in a parking lot. Wait,
don't go away! It's great ... I swear. It's dizzying, really, and hilarious.
---Cooper Berkmoyer, /San Francisco Bay Guardian
/
Lu's book looks at the cerebral struggle of artmaking and of ambient
music: as struggle between the problems of the language of the
individual and the language of the collective.
---Devin King, /Make Magazine
/
The Ambient Parkers' yen for recognition seems to be a residual effect
of their desire to create something that matters, but what their message
or the content of that matter might be is always skirted over or slides
into something new. In this way, Lu captures---and mocks as well,
perhaps, but lovingly---the existential pretenses of artistic endeavors.
In the end, Lu suggests that despite the absurdities and shifting
metamorphoses inherent in human effort, the greatest grace and sense of
humanity comes from attending, from recognizing that the deathly silence
we fear is in fact fully populated and alive once we quiet ourselves. By
the novel's end, ambience takes on new meaning, and doesn't require our
torturously theorized amplifications but graces us when we quietly
acknowledge it.
---Sueyeun Juliette Lee, /The Constant Critic/

What I love about Lu's work is her sharp wit, subtle delivery and
deadpan hilarity, which you have to slow down and listen for in order to
fully appreciate. Thus, parked, I listened.
---Jai Arun Ravine, /Lantern Reviews/

Subject:      The Factory Reading Series pre-small press book fair,
              June 29: Saikaley, Dunn, Wigmore + Lithgow

span-o (the small press action network - ottawa) presents:

		The Factory Reading Series
		pre-small press book fair reading

with readings/launches by:

	Sonia Saikaley (Ottawa)
	Victoria Dunn (Ottawa)
	Gillian Wigmore (Prince George)
	+ Michael Lithgow (Ottawa)

lovingly hosted by rob mclennan
Friday, June 29, 2012;
doors 7pm; reading 7:30pm
The Carleton Tavern,
223 Armstrong Street (at Parkdale; upstairs)

Sonia Saikaley was born and raised in Ottawa. She grew up in a traditional
Lebanese household and much of her writing is influenced by her rich
Middle Eastern heritage. She has taught English in Japan. Her fiction and
poetry have appeared in Still Point Arts Quarterly, Things Japanese: A
Collection of Short Stories, Maple Tree Literary Supplement, and the
anthology Lavander¡a - A Mixed Load of Women, Wash, and Word. She is a
graduate of the Humber School for Writers and the University of Ottawa.
Her first book, The Lebanese Dishwasher (Quattro Books, 2012), was
co-winner of the 2012 Ken Klonsky Novella Contest. Her poetry collection
Turkish Delight, Montreal Winter (TSAR Publications) will be published in
the fall 2012.

When Victoria Dunn, author of Alice Hearts Welsh Zombies, is not busy
writing, she's the ultimate Bond girl, intelligent, accomplished and
stunningly beautiful. Men of action fall helpless at her feet every day.
She doesn't just blow smoke off her pistolshe blows smoke rings. In a
parallel universe, Victoria Dunn is the evil hive mind of Victoria Higgins
and Meghan Dunn. Victoria has waged a life-long battle against depression
and is a recovering perfectionist who performs with Stand Up for Mental
Health (www.standupformentalhealth.com/). She currently works at the local
independent bookstore, because what else can you do with a degree in
Religion, Sociology and Anthropology? Meghan spent several years with the
Canadian Army Reserve before putting down her rifle to study Classical
History. She hated selling frozen yogurt, loved working at a comic book
store, and has never met a handcraft she doesn't adore. Meghan is happily
married, and the mother of two teenagers who are very impressed by her
expertise in zombiology.

Dirt of Ages is Gillian Wigmores second book.  Her first, soft geography,
won the 2008 Relit award.  Her work has been published in magazines, short
listed for prizes, and anthologized.  She lives in Prince George, BC.

Michael Lithgow is a PhD candidate in the School of Journalism and
Communication. His poetry has appeared in Arc Magazine, The New Quarterly
and Fiddlehead. Selections of his work have been included in Rutting
Season (Buffalo Runs Press, 2009) and Undercurrents: New Voices in
Canadian Poetry (Cormorant Books, 2010).  His first solo collection,
Waking in the Tree House, was published in Spring 2012 by Cormorant Books.
He is currently a contributing editor at ArtThreat.net, research associate
with the Canadian Alternative Media Archive project, and director of
OpenMedia.ca.  His doctoral research explores aesthetics, truth and
dissent in digital and performance cultures.

Here's a new generative net art piece by Vancouver's Kate Armstrong and
Michael Tippett. It's called Space Video:
http://turbulence.org/Works/spacevideo/

This is a wife/husband team. Kate is an artist and writer; Michael is an
artist-programmer.

"Space Video addresses ideas of exploration in relation to inner and outer
space. Having noticed that there are shared aesthetic qualities of video
imagery that accompany disparate cultural and scientific phenomena including
guided meditation, hypnosis, undersea and space exploration by NASA,
motivational speaking, powerpoint backgrounds, science fiction, psychedelic
drug culture, electronic music, popular spirituality, and computer effects,
we have built a generative system that mixes an original non-linear
narrative with YouTube videos on these subjects as they are uploaded in real
time. These videos often attempt to portray what are ultimately non-visual
spaces, producing images that are at once placeholders, images of the
transcendental, trippy intergalactic stereotypes, and fields for
persuasion."

Kate wrote the text. Of it, she says:

"The narrative is inspired by technical manuals and science fiction novels,
and references diverse sources including 1960s American adventure books for
boys (such as the adventures of Tom Swift by Victor Appleton II) and the
Victorian flapper ethic of the 1920's British literary compendium for girls
called Blackie's Girls' Annual. Themes include adventure, exploration,
recreation, infinity, technology, action, and decorum."

Kate and Michael did a somewhat related earlier piece called Graphik Dynamo
at http://www.turbulence.org/Works/dynamo/ . It's related in that, again,

it's a generative piece where the visuals are retrieved via a feed from the

V Manuscript

Thursday, April 19th @ 8 pm
at the AS220 Project Space=20
95 Matthewson Street
Providence, RI
http://www.as220.org

Mair=E9ad Byrne immigrated to the United States from Ireland in 1994, for p=
oetry. She earned a PhD in Theory & Cultural Studies (Purdue University 200=
1), writing a dissertation on contemporary theories of metaphor. Publicatio=
ns include poetry collections The Best of (What's Left of) Heaven (Publishi=
ng Genius 2010), Talk Poetry (Miami University Press 2007), SOS Poetry (/ub=
u Editions 2007) and Nelson & The Huruburu Bird (Wild Honey Press 2003), an=
d the recent chapbook Lucky (Little Red Leaves 2011). She is the inventor o=
f couscous, a movable feast of poetry, music and performance with participa=
nts from the community, colleges / institutions, and out-of-town, wherever =
that town may be. Currently (for her) it's Providence, where she is an Asso=
ciate Professor of Poetry + Poetics at Rhode Island School of Design.

Jennifer Karmin has published, performed, exhibited, taught, and experiment=
ed with language across the U.S., Japan, and Kenya. Her multidisciplinary p=
rojects have been presented at festivals, artist-run spaces, and on city st=
reets. She is the author of the text-sound epic Aaaaaaaaaaalice (Flim Forum=
 Press, 2010) and her writing is included in the anthology I'll Drown My Bo=
ok: Conceptual Writing by Women (Les Figues Press, 2012). Jennifer teaches =
in the Creative Writing program at Columbia College Chicago and at Truman C=
ollege, where she works with immigrants as a community educator.=20

The performances of artist V Manuscript combine text and music which unders=
core ornate corporeal and poetically virulent practices of endurance, tensi=
on, release, and concentration. The writings of V Manuscript are constructe=
d in an autotelic method using a combination of journaling and auto-fiction=
 while applying evolutionary algorithms to regenerate a syntax that is crac=
ked, fractured and utterly familiar. The text is then edited, re-poeticized=
 and re-inserted back into a master narrative. V Manuscript's materials inc=
lude bondage and restraint and a variety of ritual objects and occult mater=
ials; rope, candle, needles, knives are employed and often amplified in the=
 performance. V Manuscript composes with noise, which has no interface, whi=
ch is transgressive, which must be free to encourage the random, the hybrid=
, the dissonant, the impure; the awful must remain awful. The many V Manusc=
ripts focus on the absence of absolutes and the margins of
 masochism, eroticism and androgyny. Since 1996, V Manuscript has appeared =
with partner Maralie as the performance art/band Humanbeast. She is current=
ly working on a novel.=20

From manifestos in an emergency to emergent manifestos. From articulating
de Mans to the demand for articulation and back again, lest the closed
community eddy into an ant mill
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_mill> circling
its own affinities (return of the same of the same of the same return).
The incrementalism of the broken window
policy<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory> that
supposedly keeps contradictions controllable within a localized feedback
window fails when it's Windows that gets broken, broken into, hunting for
Ether Eggs.  That was the world you saw just now.  Its contradictions are
our own, our currency, actualit=E9, =E0 la une.

Articulate your multitudes, contradict them, wipe-out or re-up.  Alter,
delete, add, share.  Cut, paste, link, strike, troll, flame, scroll.
 Stigmathaumaturgy.  Forgive me: I wanted you here in the googledoc, where

VERSAL IS TURNING TEN
http://www.versaljournal.org


In 2002, one Australian and two Americans walked into a bar. They came
out with Amsterdam's first international literary & arts journal.

This year marks the 10th anniversary of Versal. Boom.

Publishing an incredible range of the world's literary and art talent,
and widely acclaimed for its strong and wide-reaching aesthetic and
innovative design, Versal is now celebrating the arrival of its 10th
edition. The drumroll towards this exciting milestone started in March
when Versal was awarded first place in the 26th annual New York Book
Show. And the editors of Versal are in the mood to celebrate.

Versal was started as part of a volunteer effort to build a vibrant and
inclusive, international literary community in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands. Since 2002, the team behind Versal has organized readings
and events, festivals, workshops and writing groups, including, most
recently, the Amsterdam shows of the world-famous Literary Death Match.
Today, thanks to years of dedication on the part of Versal's local
editorial team, Amsterdam is now home to a healthy literary scene, with
many groups, organizations, writers, and even publishers. Versal's
10-issue milestone, therefore, also marks 10 years of this growing,
successful community.

Join us in toasting to 10 years of our literary community and its
flagship Versal: Wednesday, May 23 at BoCinq. Free entry, but RSVP only.
Doors open at 7pm. The dress code is "gold tie". Full details and RSVP
info: http://www.versaljournal.org

Leading up to the launch, Versal's founder and editor Megan M. Garr is
writing a series about being its editor for the last ten years. Follow
her here: http://versaljournal.blogspot.com

The Claudius App <http://theclaudiusapp.com/> is proud to announce the
publication of C=E9sar Vallejo's "Lost"
Interview<http://theclaudiusapp.com/2-vallejo.html>,
published in the *Heraldo de Madrid *in January 1931, recovered,
translated, and generously annotated by Kent Johnson. Over coffee with the =
*
Heraldo*'s interviewer (Q: C=E9sar Vallejo, why have you come here? CV: Wel=
l,
to drink coffee.), Vallejo discusses precision,*Trilce* in relation to its
predecessors and contemporaries, and a non-extant then-forthcoming volume
of poems, *The Central Institute of Labor*. This is the sole record of the
great poet's conversation, and the first appearance of it, unabridged, in
English.

Yours,
Jeff Nagy and Eric Linsker

Location: Poetry Center Rubel Room
A macro and a micro view of contemporary poetic production:
  =95 Macro: Pecha Kucha Tucson (60 different ways of making poetry off t=
he=20
page today). A way to focus wide-ranging enthusiasms for unusual=20
contemporary poetic practices.
  =95 Micro: A look at the very fat line between the visual and the textu=
al, in 31=20
examples. If you see the difference between

no=20
fair princess

and

no fair
princess

you understand that text has a signifying visual component. A poem on a p=
age=20
in a book is possibly purely textual. A painting of a figure is possibly =
purely=20
visual. And between these two extremes lives a very wide expanse of=20
exploration which blends the two. The examples we'll see and discuss were=

selected specifically for how difficult they are to pigeon-hole as either=

How the website presents one avatar for the self, in the way that books=20=

self-publishing the self's work, ideas about how we constantly publish th=

of decisions (and accidents) in the self and how it is made public.

Artistexts
Internationally renowned author, book artist, and visual theorist Johanna=
=20
Drucker has selected more than 20 artist books created in a deliberate=20=

dialogue between design and writing. These artistexts explore how poetics=

as palimpsests, recombinations, excisions, swarms, unfoldings, and turnin=
gs.=20
The University of Arizona Poetry Center Library is proud to present works=
 by=20
legendary artists such as Tom Phillips, Walter Hamady, Emmett Williams, D=

Higgins, Madeline Gins, Johanna Drucker, John Crombie, and many others.

Between Page and Screen
Produced by Amaranth Borsuk in collaboration with programmer Brad Bouse,=20=

=93Between Page and Screen=94 draws on the traditions of the artist's boo=
k and=20
concrete and digital poetry to explore the place of books as objects in a=
n era=20
of increasingly screen-based reading. The pages of the book contain no te=
xt,=20
only black and white geometric shapes and a web address leading to=20
betweenpageandscreen.com, where the reader follows instructions to displa=
y=20
the book in front of his or her webcam. Doing so releases the text, which=
=20
leaps off the page and into three-dimensional space. The poems, a series =
of=20
cryptic letters between two lovers struggling to define their relationshi=
p, only=20
appear in this augmented space where paper meets pixel, a between-space=20=

opened up by the reader.

Christine Hume=92s Listening Stations
Audience members will be invited to lie their heads on pillows imbedded w=
ith=20
speakers playing original sonic versions of the work from Hume's book of=20=

poems Shot, an investigation of night, insomnia, and its inextricable dia=
logue=20
with a selfhood that cannot settle down. From this position, poetry and m=
usic=20

 that=20
relies on our capacities to "hear things" at night.

Cecilia Vicu=F1a=92s site-specific installation

Hi everyone,

If anyone knows... I'm trying to reach Robert Wilson (of the Phoenix
bookshop) does anyone have a contact for him?
Also, does anyone know who Vance Morgan is and whether he is alive? He is a
person who
Eigner corresponded with in the 80's and I can't figure out who he is.
Also, if anyone wants to publish an excerpt of a Larry Eigner biography-
please backchannel me.
(I'm telling  you, it's pretty engaging!)

Love, Jennifer

Dear friends of the Writers House:

After seven fabulously effective years as our Program Coordinator, Erin =

and will miss her.

So we are now taking applications for the full-time position of Program =
Coordinator at the Kelly Writers House. If you wish to apply, please =
submit applications through Penn's jobs site here:

A brief description of the job is below. Applicants are urged to take a =
long look at the KWH web site (http://writing.upenn.edu/wh/) to get a =
sense of the programs, projects, and events hosted.

work; scheduling room usage in the Writers House; communicating with =
visiting authors, agents, Penn community members, alumni, and others =
about event and project details; serving as KWH liaison to various =
departments, organizations, and hubs at Penn and in Philadelphia; and =

T(exto-) V(isual) Poetry, Vernon Frazer's latest collection, is now =
available in hard copy as well as online. Frazer's latest fusion of =
textual and visual elements has received the following praise from his =
colleagues:

retina sizzler
scrambles your voice box with the airwaves
no matter how much you adjust the rabbit ears
the gravity field shifts
obliterating any normal mode of reading

---Andrew Topel

With stimulating collocations of text/angled text, symbols/aural =
explosions, Vernon Frazer intuitively combines various bouts of momentum =
to create a neoteric deliverance of force, finesse, and indeed =93an =
elusive gratification=94.  However, what eludes here resounds when =
found, in that the brilliance of T V Poetry simultaneously composes =
Frazer=92s musically innate circumference of rhythm with a language =
varied and diverse, architecting a collection of abstract =
representation, aggregating movement and desire to outline this gifted =
writer=92s energetic approach.=20

MIME-Version: 1.0

This just in from out Colorado Springs from poet Noel Black whose recent
book Uselysses came out from Ugly Duckling....

Dear Friends, the great West Coast poet and publisher Kevin Opstedal (Gas
Magazine, Surf Zombie, Blue Press, etc.) is in a pretty major financial
pickle right now and needs our help. Please go to www.bluepressbooks.com,
buy as many of the amazing chapbooks (everyone from Jim Carroll to Joanne
Kyger, Bill Berkson, et. al.) that you can, and consider making an
additional donation by clicking the DONATE link at the top of the page. You
can also mail any unwanted books to him that he can sell online to 126
Washburn Avenue, Santa Cruz CA, 95060. We'd like to help him raise $4,000
to keep himself and the press afloat after a really grueling stint of
unemployment during which he burned through his entire savings, retirement
and many emergency grants. Kevin has published many of the greats, but he
also gave many young poets, myself included, their starts. PLEASE SHARE
THIS EVENT WIDELY. Thanks! Noel Black

To add a bit to Noel's PUSH:

 Opstedal pretty much jump started things and showed much support for a
number of younger poets and artists round San Francisco such as Noel, but
also the likes of: Cedar Sigo, Will Yackulic, Eddie Berrigan, Micah
Ballard, along with myself, and his avid support of the work of poet Lewis
MacAdams is ongoing (he recently edited MacAdams's Selected Poems DEAR
OXYGEN now out from UNO press. Kevin also wrote a terrific historical
record of BOLINAS and the poets who have lived and worked there that is up
on a recent issue of BIG BRIDGE. And although unemployed for the last
several years Kevin has continued to publish the work of other poets. Any
interest/assistance would be awesome.

***Subject:* FW: KICKSTARTER FUNDRAISING for the 100 Thousand Poets for
Change Headquarters Event bb1


Thinking Locally and Acting Globally…

That’s what my friends Michael Rothenberg and Terri Carrion of Sonoma
County are doing. Last September their work supported hundreds of
poetic-social justice grass root events all over the globe.

This year over 500 events in 100 countries are scheduled for September
29^th , 2012.

I don’t usually approach friends and colleagues for support, but I
believe in their project and will be working on securing grants for them
to continue this truly amazing project.

Right now, we are hoping to “kickstart” that funding and establish a
demonstrable groundswell of support to show potential funders.

As you can see from the attachment from Michael and Terri, founders and
the workhorses of 100,000 Poets for Change, feel the same way and would
appreciate ANY support you could throw

Our way. The number of contributors as well reaching their goal of
$2,500 in less than six weeks counts! They are already at $1500 pledged
after only 15 days. If we don’t hit our goal, all of

The money stays with those who pledged funds.

This is an act of poetry changing the world, one community group at a
time.. and yet, all at once! However, the work behind the scenes goes on
all year.

If you have blogs, e-mail groupings or e-newsletters to folks who might
also give a few bucks and be counted, please pass it on.

Please check it out! The website is amazing and impressive. Please see
what you can do and…count me on your indebted forever list.

With Kind Regards,

Cecelia Belle

Fundraising Campaign

Dear Friends of 100 Thousand Poets for Change,

I am writing to let you know that Terri and I have set up a 100 TPC
KICKSTARTER PAGE
<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/377638302/100-thousand-poets-for-change-headquarters-event>
in an effort to raise funds to help us to continue organizing 100
Thousand Poets for Change 2012, and more specifically to help us plan
and set up our “100 TPC Headquarters Event” from where we will manage
all the September 29^th global events!

As you know, we have no funding or sponsors thus far and so we have
funded the past year’s work on our own. We have recently applied for our
non-profit status and hope to be able to get funding from foundations
and sponsors soon, but until our non-profit status is approved we are
asking for support from our friends, and soon-to-be friends, too!

For those of you unfamiliar with Kickstarter
<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/377638302/100-thousand-poets-for-change-headquarters-event>,
the basic approach is that you state your fundraising goal for your
project and then set the time in which you think you can achieve (or
surpass) that goal. If at the end of your fundraising period you do not
reach your goal you don’t receive any of the donations. So, if we do not
reach our goal of $2500, all the money will be refunded to the donors
accordingly.

Kickstarter
<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/377638302/100-thousand-poets-for-change-headquarters-event>
explains it like this…

/"Why is Kickstarter funding all-or-nothing? On Kickstarter, a project
must reach its funding goal before time runs out or no money changes
hands. Why? It protects everyone involved. This way, no one is expected
to develop a project with an insufficient budget, which sucks. Remember
you set your own funding goal, so aim to raise the minimum amount you'll
need to create your vision. Projects can always raise more than their
goal, and often do"/

Terri and I have set our goal for $2,500 and we have 60 days to raise
these funds. I am sure you will agree this is not much money for running
the website, archiving for Stanford University, sending out ten thousand
press releases, general outreach, and overall management of all the
activity on the day of the event which will include monitoring and
sharing livestreams, skype sessions and much more!

The 100 TPC KICKSTARTER PAGE
<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/377638302/100-thousand-poets-for-change-headquarters-event>
explains everything in more detail. Check it out. There are a whole
bunch of unique gifts offered for donors as well. You might see
something you like!

Please understand that we are actually very uncomfortable asking for
funding, we know you all work really hard and poetry is not a high
paying job. But, I think we all agree that 100 Thousand Poets for Change
is worth doing on a long-term basis.

So far we have over 500 events in 100 countries confirmed for September
29, 2012. With your help we hope there will be 1000 events!

We thank you for all your friendship and amazing moral support!

Please help us by donating any amount of money, really. $1, $5, $10,
$20, $50 or more. Every little bit helps! You can go online to the 100
TPC KICKSTARTER PAGE
<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/377638302/100-thousand-poets-for-change-headquarters-event>
and make your donations. Your support will be greatly appreciated and
will enable us to keep organizing 100 TPC 2012.

Thank you for all you do!

The 100 TPC KICKSTARTER PAGE
<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/377638302/100-thousand-poets-for-change-headquarters-event>
has just been launched!

We now have 60 days to reach our goal of 2,500 dollars.

Please help us reach our funding goal.

And please tell all your friends and loved ones about the 100 TPC
Kickstarter Page, share the link, 100 TPC KICKSTARTER
<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/377638302/100-thousand-poets-for-change-headquarters-event>
and encourage them to donate to our fundraising campaign!

Peace and Love,

Michael Rothenberg and Terri Carrion

In White Writing

by Alan Halsey

In White Writing is a narrative visual poem or graphic novella or
both. A record in either case of a life lived on paper, the
writing-dust of 2007-10 retrieved, collaged and drawn over, drawn back
on itself in a wholesale reversal or revaluation of print values,
white text and images showing up and out of a solid and dreamless
black ground.

"If there is no point of rest, if everything is loose but nothing is
torn, if there is no monochromy of image-category, romantic nonsense
is transformed into a multiverse, a comic heterotopia. Deliciously so
in Alan Halsey=92s graphic series In White Writing. Where there is the
history of culture =96 of relativizing cultures =96 there is no order.
Gradually, everything descends, or is freed, into =91demockery=92."

Description:

=E2=80=98In this remarkable new book Katherine Hastings, as the title sugge=
sts, says hello to song: song of =E2=80=9CA ceiling of stars=E2=80=9D, =E2=
=80=9Cslow lava flow=E2=80=9D, and a sensual iridescence that beautifully e=
xpresses Hawaiian love. Hastings does much more: the reader who begins to r=
ead these radiant words may start out =E2=80=9Cin the quenched hive of soli=
tude=E2=80=9D but soon finds her or himself =E2=80=9CAfloat in naked beauty=
=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CTurned tenderly/toward/together=E2=80=9D! Hastings is a=
 poet of such skill and grace that the earth itself (in the spectacular for=
m of Hawaii) achieves a lyric, singing voice in her work=E2=80=99. (Lee Slo=
nimsky)

Dear Friends and Colleagues;

These five panels of "The Lost Way of Stones" conclude a project begun 10 months ago:
http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/weishaus/Lost/Lost-8/8-1.htm

I'm aware that reading these texts, and images, take time out of busy schedules, so I want to thank everyone who has undertaken this journey,
and those who will in the future.

If you haven't been following its progress, "The Lost Way of Stones" begins at:
http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/weishaus/Lost/Intro.htm
After the introduction there are links to the panels in sequences of five, now clearly marked.

Best Regards,

Poet and performer Denis Mahoney (52, lived in Boston) passed away last
week. (http://www.blackpigliberationfront.com)  Many knew him by his adop=
ted
persona which I first learned about on his Facebook page: Tariq Zayid. Si=
nce
I haven't seen mention of his passing other than on that page I thought I=
=92d
better mention it.  It seems Denis had a serious fall in the dark a while=

back causing serious injuries from which apparently he did not recover,
although he seemed to recovering. The autopsy will tell more. Denis was a=
n
extraordinary person, and this news is very sad.
=20
Here's what showed up on that FB page:

Dear Facebook Friends of Tariq Zayid (a.k.a Denis Mahoney),

By now many of you have heard the sad news of Tariq's passing. He died
peacefully at home on Tuesday, April 17, 2012 at the age of 52.

A memorial service for Denis will be held at "La Grua Center" in Stoningt=
on,
CT on Friday, April 27, 2012 at 12:30pm. Everyone is also invited to a
reception at "Skippers Dock" immediately following the memorial service. =
The
La Grua Center, and Skippers Dock are located very close to each other so=

you may park in either lot. Please allow a little extra driving time beca=
use
Stonington Borough can be difficult to navigate.

More information online: http://bit.ly/I6j8Vq

Over the course of Spring semester, eighteen NYU students have engaged in
intense electro-textual experiments: composing, mangling, generating and
remixing electronic text using the Python programming language. For one
night only, these students will gather to present and perform their
experiments to the general public.

What to expect: innovative poetic forms, bizarre textual interfaces,
generative satire, advanced natural language processing techniques, and
more!

Here's a round-up of last year's performances: http://bit.ly/v0m0HE

Reading and Writing Electronic Text is a course offered at NYU=92s
Interactive Telecommunication Program. (http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/). The

Dear friends at POETICS-BUFFALO,

I have been invited to do a paper and presentation on "The New Wave of
Innovative Writers in Ireland" at a Conference in July on the campus
of the University of California in Berkeley.

I would like to be inclusive and participatory with any possible
writers for my report.

And I will have a section in my report for "The Irish Diaspora" and
want to include a few Irish-Americans, Irish-Australians,
Irish-Argentinians ... as long as they are INNOVATIVE writers.

So, if you fit this description ...

Please send me, as soon as possible (I do have a deadline next week) ...

1.)  two or three sentences describing your philosophy of writing, and
your sense of method(s) in writing;

2.)  a list of titles of your publications and/or performances.
Please include the name of publisher, place of publication, and date
of publication for each title;

3.)  two or three URLs where your work(s) can be purchased.

Thank you.

I suspect that this effort will bring a lot of attention to INNOVATIVE
writers in Ireland!

Please circulate this message to any other writer you know in Ireland
or the Irish Diaspora you think should be included and ask them to
e-mail me directly as soon as possible with the answers to 1 : 2 : 3 :
above!

Best regards,

S=E9amas Cain
