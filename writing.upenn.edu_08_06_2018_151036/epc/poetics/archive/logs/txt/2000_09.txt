Hi all, is there any chance that the article in Lingua Franca could be
posted to the list for clarity as I don't have access to it. If it's on the
web, perhaps the URL could be posted for the benefit of us all. Cheers, Peter

Here's an ironic counterpoint to the Lingua Franca article. From the
"Knowledge at Wharton" website at Penn.

-----------------------

"Poems Are Long Journeys In Risk"


For more than 25 years John Barr has pursued parallel lives as a businessman
and a poet. A long-time senior executive at Morgan Stanley, 10 years ago he
founded Barr Devlin Associates, an investment-banking boutique active in the
natural gas industry. The firm was acquired three years ago by Societe
Generale. Barr also is president emeritus of the Poetry Society of America,
the oldest poetry association in the U.S., and the author of several books
of poetry. The most recent is "Grace," an epic poem based largely on the
monologues of Ibn Opcit, an imaginary Caribbean poet and gardner. Barr is
part of a long tradition of poet-businesspeople, whose best known
representatives include T.S. Eliot, an international banker, and Wallace
Stevens, an insurance executive. In a recent conversation with
Knowledge@Wharton, Barr spoke about business and poetry-and how each of his
worlds energizes the other as long as the two don't collide.


Knowledge@Wharton: Could you begin by talking about your business
activities?


Barr: I spent 18 years at Morgan Stanley as a partner in charge of the
public utility practice in the investment banking division. Some 10 years
ago, in 1990, I retired and with a couple of partners, we started our own
company, Barr Devlin Associates. We continued to do financial advisory work
providing merger and acquisition advice to U.S.-based utilities that were
dealing with new trends in that industry by merging or restructuring
themselves.

We were fortunate to be in the right place at the right time. I sometimes
compare our small company to one of those pretzel vendors in Manhattan who
is on the right street corner, where everybody wants a hot pretzel. We were
in the thick of action in the mid-1990s, when almost all the utility
companies in the U.S. wanted to merge. We continue to be in that business
and have been investment bankers to half of all the largest deals. There
have been almost 20 mergers so far among our utility clients.

We could feel the utilities merger market being transformed in 1997. Deals
were changing from stock-for-stock to cash-and-stock transactions, and as a
boutique we could not offer the financing service of a large balance sheet.
In addition, the utilities merger business was becoming international, with
European utilities starting to look at U.S. utilities. Again, as a New
York-based boutique, we could not take advantage of that business. So we
began to talk to a handful of prime international banks, which all showed an
interest in us, and we were very pleased in 1998 to be acquired and become a
part of Societe Generale (SG). We are now in our third year with them, all
my partners have remained in the business, and we have SG's balance sheet
and global platform together with the Barr Devlin franchise. We have been
doing a lot of business.


Knowledge@Wharton: What transactions have you done recently?


Barr: Duke Power-or Duke Energy as it is now called-is a major utility
company. In 1997 it used us as financial advisors when it merged with
PanEnergy, the second largest gas pipeline company at that time. That merger
produced what continues to be the largest utility company in the U.S. It was
a great adventure and a benchmark transaction. More recently, we were hired
by Enron to sell their utility in Oregon, called Portland General. Closer to
home, my partners and I represented Northeast Utilities in Connecticut when
the company merged with Con Edison several months ago. That merger will
create the largest utility in the Northeast. We have also done smaller
transactions all over the country and in Europe. It's been busy.


Knowledge@Wharton: Has poetry kept you equally busy?


Barr: Until the 1990s I had published my poetry in small magazines, but I
hadn't published any books. The 1990s became a major publishing time for
me-I published six books between 1989 and 1999. That started with a series
of three limited editions or fine press editions. Those books in 1997 were
combined into a trade press edition called "The Hundred Fathom Curve," which
was published by Story Line Press. In 1999 I published "Grace," which was a
major departure from my prior writing.


Knowledge@Wharton: One thing that makes "Grace" striking is your use of
Caribbean-like dialect in your writing. You say in your introductory note to
the book that the voices in "Grace" use the freedoms of dialect to"get away
with murder." Could you explain that?


Barr: "Getting away with murder" is the perfect phrase for me to deal with
the potential discomfort I felt in writing a book which is in black
Caribbean language. I'm not black, I'm not Caribbean, and I wasn't invited
to write the book. The debate in poetry in the U.S. today centers around
books where writers take on personae that are different than who they are.
Getting away with murder, for me, was a literary license to invent a dialect
that reads like a Caribbean dialect. It seeks the economy and energy of all
dialects, in my view. The people in "Grace," like Caribbean people, use
words with a high metaphoric content. They don't always bother with suffixes
and prefixes-they go for the jugular in terms of efficiency and economy in
the way they use language. This is true of all dialects you hear around the
world. That is what I was hoping to capture in "Grace."


Knowledge@Wharton: You clearly took a big risk writing "Grace" the way you
did. How do you manage risk in your poetry and in your business?


Barr: There are a lot of great minds-including many at Wharton-who have
focused on how you manage business risks of various sorts. The decision by
my partners and myself to place our little company within the arms of SG, a
larger enterprise, represented one of the ways we chose to manage risk. We
saw opportunity from our merger, but we also saw stability in it. As a small
company, you are only as good as your next deal. While we did have great
good fortune and success as an independent boutique, when we became part of
a global business platform-and SG is one of the largest financial
institutions in the world-it created a kind of permanence and stability. The
cyclicality of our business doesn't have the same effect on SG that it might
have on a small business. The merger was the way we chose to manage that
risk and also to increase the upside of the business.

On the poetry side, how do you manage risk? I think it's not possible to
hedge an open commodities position in poetry. Poetry is about risk-but you
don't manage it. That is the big difference between business and poetry.
Business is always trying to create an asymmetric relationship between risk
and reward-you try to get more reward for less risk-and you try and get more
than your fair share of return. That is true of asset management, money
management and it's true of financial advice-we try to help our clients
negotiate the best deal possible in a merger.

Poems are also about risk because they embrace the unknown and the
uncertain. That is why they have excitement and vitality. Poems are long
journeys in risk. People don't write poems because they have figured it all
out; they write poems in order to figure it out. A good poem contains and
preserves, like an insect in ancient amber, that moment-of figuring
something out-forever. That is why poetry cannot seek to manage risk. You
can do things technically to preserve the moment of a poem's creation and
make it a timeless enterprise. That is what formal poetry is about-the use
of rhyme, meter and structure is important to giving permanence to poetry.
But it's not about managing risk.


Knowledge@Wharton: You once said that you see no conflict between your
business and poetic activities because you see both business and poetry as
responses of the self to a chaotic world, and that you see yourself as
someone who goes around the world transforming that chaos into money and
poetry. Could you explore this theme further?


Barr: It's still a benchmark of how I view the two strange bedfellows that
business and poetry sometimes are. Both draw their water out of the same
well. Both in their own ways are efforts to seek to bring order to a chaotic
and random universe. Business does it in a way that will produce a profit
for the shareholders, if it is successful. Poetry creates an order that I
would describe as the capture of understanding.

One of the great things we get out of Shakespeare is that once he has
articulated something, there's a comfort level that comes from that. It's
almost like a talisman. It gives one a feeling of control-not in the sense
of a control freak, but of control of the unknown and the uncertain. To me,
the act of articulation is a basic human response to feelings of uncertainty
and even of fear.

That is why in old and ancient literatures, names are so important. If you
know a person's name, you have a kind of power over them. Maybe this goes to
the primitive tribal fears of having one's picture taken, too. A picture
becomes a physical possession of a person's image. There's a moment in the
"Odyssey" where Odysseus and his men have been shipwrecked. The mythical
Cyclops asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies, "My name is no man."
It is that ancient encounter with the unknown, where the first thing you try
to do is know how to call it. You find that in Shakespeare, and you also
find that in the great ancient literatures. That is fundamental to what you
get out of writing and reading good poetry.


Knowledge@Wharton: Wallace Stevens was well known as a businessman and as a
poet. It is said that he had two compartments in his briefcase: He kept all
his business documents on one side, and his poetry manuscripts on the other.
In these days of the Palm Pilot, a lot more intermingling is possible. Do
you see business and poetry as separate parts of your life, or do they
intermingle, with one feeding the other?


Barr: I did not know that Wallace Stevens story, but I love it. He was an
orderly man-he was a lawyer for Hartford Insurance in Connecticut, and he
had a very logical business side to him. But his poetry went the other way.

Yes, there is a duality to the two sides of the briefcase. But if the
poet-businessperson is willing to let the two sides get close to each other,
it is a potential source of great energy for both. What do I mean by that?
Thirty years ago, people were not as tolerant about a businessman who wrote
poetry. It would have been hard for him to be taken seriously by his
clients. But today that is not the case. While I did not advertise my poetry
when I was in my twenties and thirties, I don't have any problem with people
knowing that now, and they too are fine about it. I think I am probably a
better public speaker because of my poetry. I let the poet side of me loose
in business situations-not in an irrational sense but in an inventive sense.
Imagination can work in any situation it is allowed to. A lot of my work on
the business side involves a different kind of creativity, but it is still
work of the imagination.

Let me now explore the other side of the argument. I think business can be a
source of subject matter for a poet. It took me a long time to open all the
doors in my life that I did in writing "Grace." That book was written over a
ten-year period. I came to the realization recently that there were no
people in my poetry for the first 30 years of my writing. I wrote
first-person, lyric poetry-and in a lot of lyric poetry there is no one
except the speaker and nature, or the speaker and art. There is nothing but
people in "Grace." The world of humanity came flooding in for me in "Grace."
That's an example of letting the business side-or the world of affairs-enter
the poetry. There's a great release in that.

Let me add a footnote. I recently came to realize that I decided to leave
Morgan Stanley, where I had happily been for 18 years, in 1989. That was the
same year I began to write "Grace." Looking back, I think that one was my
declaration of independence as a businessman, and the other was my
declaration of independence as a poet.


Knowledge@Wharton: So you believe that your poetry helps you remain in touch
with the imaginative part of yourself, and that contact with your own
creativity helps you in business?


Barr: Yes I do. There's no question about it. As I said before, it's like
drawing water out of the same well.

Let me tell you a story to illustrate the power of letting the two
sides-business and poetry-get as close together as possible rather than far
apart in a separate briefcase. There's a story about the early days of
atomic energy, before scientists understood it really well. One American
scientist had a game that he played with two halves of uranium. The concept
of critical mass is that if you let those two halves come together, it would
result in a nuclear explosion. If the two are kept separate, it won't cause
an explosion because each half has less than critical mass. Well, this
scientist would put these two halves on a table with a geiger counter, and
bring them closer and closer together. The geiger counter would soar, and
then he would take the two halves away from each other. This is a true
story.

One day he made a mistake and the two halves got too close together. There
was a nuclear flash, and ultimately everyone in the laboratory died from the
radiation exposure. But because they were scientists, all of them noted how
many feet away they were from the critical mass. Their data was used as raw
material in measuring the effect of nuclear blasts.

The scientist called what he was doing "tickling the dragon's tail." My
metaphor in all this is that if the poet-businessman decides to ticke the
dragon's tail-and bring the two hemispheres of business and poetry
together-he should let them get close but not too close. If it's done right,
it can be a great source of energy.


Knowledge@Wharton: At the end of your career, would you rather be remembered
for business or poetry?


Barr: For poetry. Poetry is forever. Business is about providing for one's
family. I've never sought a public reputation in business though if it has
come, I have been grateful. But in poetry, you hope not just to create a
profit for shareholders. You deal with fundamental questions that have vexed
humanity since the beginning-life, death, love and all their variations. I'd
love to be remembered as some sort of a poet.

if you were taking issue with a simple binary, you were either 1. responding
to my post, 2. responding to epstein's article, or 3. responding to internal
stimuli.

you couldn't have been responding to my post, because what binary I even
reference is the one that epstein appears to create in the introductory
paragraphs.  i have repeatedly mentioned that the article does not seem to
continue in such a black and white way beyond the introduction.  i neither
suggest that epstein's discussion of purity/sellout is binary through the
entire article nor do i put forth my own binary about purity or selling out.
I certainly never make any argument for "total purity or total
assimilation;" in fact what i say about the issue myself and what i see in
most of the article outside of the introduction is anything but "total
purity or total assimilation."

you may therefore be either responding to epstein's article or to internal
stimuli.  or both.

my apologies for losing my patience because I fear I am not being
comprehended.  i just don't know how else to express this.

Patrick

ps i think condemnation of binaries as inherently 'simple' perhaps is
equivalent to saying things like, 'human cognition is simple' or 'computers
are simple' or 'numbers are simple.'  further, to spurn simplicity is
perhaps an even more specious move.  i do think spurning binaries for their
binariness smacks of irrational intellectual fashion and is overly
simplistic.

pss andrew's article deals with the soldout-purity *spectrum* and does show
the shades of grey along the range and how people like bernstein or silliman
aren't purely sellouts or keeping it real.  i think the article is worth
reading, as there is plenty of valuable information.  like the mcclatchy
quotes.  but for some reason I do not find the sellout/purity spectrum (this
is an analog thing, this spectrum) very fruitful. I maintain, i find the
range between "total purity or total assimilation" as fruitless as the
extremes, but not because of any particular structure to the arguments.
there is nothing pure.  period.  i thought this is something painfully and
easily learned in childhood.  i guess some people haven't learned that yet.
but that's just me.  i guess many other people still need to make
discoveries about what 'selling out' really means.

Hello Andrew:

        I think I was replying as much to Patrick
Herron's looking at the problem of a simple binary as I was to what
your article in Lingua Franca was doing, so perhaps I caused a little bit
of confusion there, for which I apologize.

        I'm sorry then if my post on one particular aspect of this problem
seemed like a wholesale condemnation of your article, when in fact I was
just taking issue with the idea that such a binary exists, that the choices
are either total purity or total assimilation.

Ron, our daughter's at Burning Man--but she's working Glitter Camp ("for
the adornmentally challenged") where folks are rolled in oil and
spattered with fairy dust, so I don't know how much language they're
processing.

Would you like me to ask her something when she gets back?

Come to think of it, maybe George and David should have passed on Orono

I think I agree with much of what Jacques Debrot wrote below--
but why redefine pleasure as "intense feeling?"  All intense feeling is
not pleasure.  I can see intense feeling, or emotive intensity, being
considered more important, in a poem, than whether that intesnity is
pleasurable or painful; I can also understand how one might derive
pleasure FROM an intense negative feeling--but that wouldn't make the
latter pleasure, only something from which pleasure could be derived.

In my aesthetics figuring out how this could be is important, by the
way, the main expression of the question being: what do we get out of
tragedy?  One thought: tragedy acts as a counter-irritant; another is
that an artwork, in containing something painful, or subduing it,
produces a kind of pleasurable victory over pain.

Anyway, my bottom line is that the ultimate function of art is to give
people pleasure.  Aesthetic pleasure.  Disgust IS the opposite of
pleasure.  An artwork that elicits only disgust cannot be pleasurable
(or desired by anyone sane); art that works with that which disgusts
must somehow achieve something pleasurable in spite of that, not FROM
it.

I frankly think it's a dull discussion in any form, anything even related to

it.  But perhaps I assume too easily that people understand these issues,

and maybe they don't.  Maybe many people do need to roll around with the

'sell out/sorta sellout/purely keeping it real' discussion.  For me it is a

snore.


another argument i have some distaste for is the discussion of the inherent

value of a binary description.  whether something is 2-nary or 3-nary or

1,000,000-nary is morally arbitrary to me.  smaller pixels might make for

better resolution but they require more and more work to understand and

differentiate less and less the more that we have.  but morally there's no

difference.  is there something better about 5 than 2?  just because an

argument is quaternary doesn't make it better than any binary argument.

dichotomy, trichotomy, whatever.  if you can tolerate my sense of humor on

this issue, then bear with me -- but frankly it seems as if too many people

have been reading too many poorly written books on eastern philosophy

written by white people who did just a few too many slugs of brown acid in

the 60's.  "like, binary thinking is bad, man."  there's nothing wrong with

binary arguments just because they are binary; there's always more to it.  i

think the moral evaluation of binaries has crept into our thinking as some

sort of cultural truism.


Back to the subject at hand--the Lingua Franca article doesn't ignore the

degrees between the absolutes of purest action and complete selling out.  I

think it gives clear light to efforts of some people to work within the

system and retain some values and yet be willing to flex a little.  Such

in-between activity takes a considerable amount of confidence and maturity

and it embraces the complexity of the world and our lives.  And I think that

in-betweenness is illuminated by Epstein.


>It hardly follows from that point that total assimilation into the academy

is the only other possibility.


Perhaps I did not make myself clear.  From the article it appears that some

like Bernstein and Hejinian go into the academy and even flourish there, but

all the while they are able to maintain some skepticism of the academic

system.  This is clearly not *total* assimilation and the article brings

this out.  And Silliman working for corporate America isn't a complete

sellout either (though the article makes it sound like he is in the

introduction and then later makes it sound like he isn't). The article makes

the point that Ron is publishing on small presses still instead of under the

UChicago and Princeton and Oxford academic logos.


The range, the spectrum, of pure to sellout is a dull one.  Humans want

resources.  Humans need resources.  The combination of want and need for

resources ranges widely and its discussion in the realm of poets is absurd.

No poets are truly getting rich, no one, at least not from poetry.

Patrick, I was all set to chime in on this one, but you beat me to it.  Quite
frankly, I couldn't have said it better.  We have to assume that poets eat
like the rest of the population, and to that end will require employment
somewhere.  As for the grandly conspiratorial, fat cat academics who have
nothing better to do but oppress our avant garde genius--I've met both of
them, and they're sorry.  They are now drug free.  That's it for me, except
to say thank you for your dose of common sense.  Best, Bill

Robert. I disagree, I think that too many magazines avoid clear discusion of
theory. McClatchy's stance seems simplistic too me, but it doesnt mean that
LangPo (as its being called) or the ideas or practices deriving from it are.
The question of "selling out" is complex. But I think behind the reaction
against innovation there is a simple explanation. Anything new, in whatever
field is either actually, or is felt to be, threatening to the social
structure or to what we might (loosely) call the establishment. The Chinese
Govt. will have, as one of its reasons to arrest BeiLing, that poets are
"dangerous". I say one, there may be others, good or bad.But even in
N.Z.,Australia,the U.S. or other countries such as China, most poets of
whatever ilk will reject the kind of innovative writing we associate with
say Stein, anyone in the L=A=N=G group: or anyone innovative. And innovation
and originality are vital. Otherwise there is no development(for better or
worse) in any field. So the authoritarians,patriarchs, or the
traditionalists are usually in opposition to new styles or ideas and are
often dour and timid persons. They fear change of any kind. People "fear"
poetry: even the less "strangified" writing is seen as dangerous. Is this
new? No. Its very old and is part of a continuous struggle between the new
and the old. Pound's dictum to make it new still holds. Not to is to give
up. But lets not become fixated on LangPo. There are ways of writing that
may be influenced by these writers that may go past it: as long as there is
not a reversion to simplistic traditionalism (often by critics or writers
who write in a manner that is "realistic" or "straight from the heart", and
which "tells something" (when it could be told better in formal, or
explicative prose), then new ideas will spark interesting and exciting
literature. What might be problematic is where we "take" these innovations
and new writing, and what are our motives and so on. The implication seems
to be from many of the responses to McClatchy is that its all "old news".
Well things dont change that fast: there are many questions that the L=A=N=G
poets have raised that are not yet resolved. Other things that might be
worth thinking about are David Antin's remarkable "talk poems",the British
experimantal poets, and also the way, or to what extent LangPo is of
influence outside the U.S. I came across it in 1992 at Auckland University.
But I certainly think it would be bad to relent or weaken on poetic debate
in lit. journals. Reviews function in this way. Maybe there should be a
"right of response" to criticism. A lot of "mainstream" lit. mags, while
often interesting,seem to lack "direction". That's why I raised the issue of
Scott Hamilton's "attack" on ABDOTWW. This is an interesting journal, but
seems to avoid strong theoretical discussion such that only its content
differentiates it from the other "mainstream" magazines. Of course the
content is quite challenging, but by not including more debate or theory, or
explication of  its "direction", it leaves itself open(as maybe the LangPo
writers/mags have)to charges of obscurantism or elitism. I see it as part of
an ongoing dialectic or debate. Richard taylor.

This is a weird statement, I would have thought just the oppiste, that
Bernstein welcomes both rhetoric and aesthetics, as well as pleasure.
Read "A Blow Is like an Instrument". But I guess Bernstein can be read in
variou,s opposing, contradictiry, self-contradictory ways. But weird
nevertheless.

Hi Mark,

Thanks for the response and for your apology re: confusing Herron's points
with the points made in the article itself.

In further response  -- you wrote back:

>I'm not sure quite see where the article takes on the issue I was getting
at, which is given that some degree of assimilation is unavoidable, what is
to be done with it?

To my mind, that IS very much where the article starts (for one thing, I
quote Bernstein saying "the interesting question is not whether a poet has a
job but what he or she *does* with it").  The debate over
Alan Golding's idea of LP's "provisionally complicit resistance" (which you
seem to be paraphrasing here) actually underlies the article's very
premise -- I'm
still not clear how you (or others who have made similar comments) missed
that.  I can only think that it must be somewhat related to the way Lingua
Franca framed
the piece -- the big bold title/substitle, the pull quotes, and other
magazine stylistic things that were out of my control.  For the article
itself, if you go back and look at the piece, is very much about the
struggle with these issues.  Also, you'll also notice that I (briefly) take
up the very issues you raise with regards to the post-Language generation --
yourself (literally) included (p.54).  (I mentioned you in particular
because of the fact that you address in your essays some of the issues about
institutionalization that I treat in the article).  This is probably
apparent when I say that you and your (our) peers "are no freer from the
problems posed by
institutionalization, as many embark on academic careers and begin to
wrestle with the compromises that come with greater recognition."

Take care,

Andrew

Hello Andrew:

        I think I was replying as much to Patrick
Herron's looking at the problem of a simple binary as I was to what
your article in Lingua Franca was doing, so perhaps I caused a little bit
of confusion there, for which I apologize. On the other hand, I'm not sure
I quite see where the article takes on the issue I was getting at, which
is given that some degree of assimilation is unavoidable, what is to be
done with it? For me that's where the problem actually STARTS, although
yes, I think maybe the last sentence of your piece, and a couple of the
Bernstein quotes, imply that such a problem is at stake. The Evans quotes
suggest that one still CAN divide the spaces into the binary I think we
need to avoid, at least as I read him, but I'll have to go back and look
at that again.

        I'm sorry then if my post on one particular aspect of this problem
seemed like a wholesale condemnation of your article, when in fact I was
just taking issue with the idea that such a binary exists, that the choices
are either total purity or total assimilation.

        I'd be happy to post this publically, if you wanted to do the same
with yours.

        Mark

Dear Taylor,

Very delighted to hear from you.  Your argument is very well put.  How's
life in SF?  Here the new semester will start in a few weeks, and I look
forward to another round of testing the wits of my students with Pound and
Stein, in addition to some radical poetics of the transpacific.  Speaking
of academia, I find the Lingua Franca piece utterly incapable of grasping
with the politics of poetry and poetics in school curriculum.  What Lyn
Hejinian said about "Isn't the avant-garde always pedagogical?" drives home
the important point that the avant-garde is pedagogical in ways that it
undermines the pre-established power structure in institutionalized
pedagogy.  When Epstein quotes (and complicitly endorses) Lehman's
rhetorical question that "But when a school of poetry is entirely academic.
. . how is it avant-garde?" he (and Lehman) misses entirely on the
possibility that an ideological critique of the banal academic politics may
be launched both from within and without the academy.  Anyone who has
experimented with letting his or her students "unlearn" (rather than
relearn and reinforce) their previously acquired habits of reading poetry
will understand what I am saying and may sincerely hesitate before he or
she reduces everything to "you are either academic or not!"  There's a joke
among mainland Chinese that may be relevant here: If you don't like the
Communist Party, then that's exactly the reason you should join the party
and undo it from the inside.  Of course someone beside you may scream that
"You'll be tainted before you know it!"  Of course someone inside you may
try to club you like your zen master, shouting "Wake up! It can't be done!"
 But, yes, there are commies who try to be commies differently, or Chinese
who try to be Chinese differently, or Americans to be Americans
differently--"The difference is spreading," so says Stein.  Categories can
be done and undone.  To assume that the academy is such and such and can't
be otherwise may be a good point, but it doesn't point anywhere else and
hence is a dead point.  And this is probably where the line starts, a line
between (non)liberal scepticism or even cynicism and activism.   --Y.H.

Hi Andrew:

I can see what you're saying below about the framing of the article, but I
think the issue is a little trickier and more annoying, at least to me. I
think maybe your article does come to the conclusion that we need a new way to
see the problem, but what's disturbing to me is that the problem is even put
in these terms at all; I know you're not the one who started it, of course. As
if one can't be critical of the prevailing mode of operation in an
institution, or operate sometimes outside it, and then take some action about
it from within without "selling out." The question that needs to be asked is
who would make THAT point in the first place?

So I think what some people are annoyed about (or let's just say I am) is the
fact that when non-mainstream poetry does come up in an academic
context at all, we're immediately accused of "selling out." Why is that?
Obviously, because any number of MFA programs don't want us in their programs
at all. So why isn't the Lingua Franca article about why most traditional MFA
programs can continue to blithely ignore all sorts of alternative poetries?
Why is it the academic positions of the language poets that are called into
question, instead of the academic positions of folks like Lehman and
McClatchy? No one asked McClatchy to defend his reason for being in a
university and ignorning major areas of American poetry.

To stretch a metaphor just a bit (and I know I'm doing so), compare it to an
article that was called "Can Minority Groups Assimilate into Universities and
Still Keep Their Cultural Identity?" Why wouldn't the article be called "Why
Do Universities Tell Minority Groups They Can't Keep Their Cultural Identities
If They Want to Be in Universities?"?

So, whoever framed the article, my problem would be that the frame suggests
that language poets have to justify their position in the academy, whereas the
more significant problem seems to me about the academy justifying its
continued attempt to keep language poets out.

Mark

Pray tell me.  Why, then, if you vote, you will likely vote Gore?  Why do
you attack Republican philosophy and blame that party for acts you call
tyrannical by the Federal Government and its police?

The reason you will vote Gore/Clinton is that you believe in a set of what I
call Liberal political visions that will lead inevitably to their EXACT
OPPOSITE.  For instance, ALL of the WOMEN who stood up to the Big HEE or
A.A. Gore are now being AUDITED by the IRS! But of course this inconvenient
fact is never going to be acknowledged by the preponderant majority of
writers on this line and the line's administration. As a RadLib feminist
poet in Boulder said, "I want women to have power in government, not Jean
Kirkpatrick."  Who on this line even remembers Jean Kirkpatrick?

In other words, regardless of your NICE words, ostensibly reasonable, your
vision will lead to even MORE government in the US of the sort you say you
deplore. WHY?  Because it is the type of intellectual who dominates this
Line that runs China today!  The peasants who now REVOLT against Zemin
revolt against an intellectual class of people who think like MANY on this
LINE!

If you took the time to really understand Republicanism, you could make it
work to attain the justices you seek.  More poets should adopt Republicanism
as their vehicle for the kind of freedom they supposedly embody.  I say:
To hell with Ernesto Cardinale and the poetry of Mao Zedung.  Forget it.
State run poetry is an oxymoron!  Get back into the more sophisticated and
grounded views of Frost.

Nearly all of the talk I see on this line attempts to reform the evermore
tyrannical Federal administration of the country by even MORE of it, simply
replacing the hand of one deluded Liberal generation with another, one
radical clique that seized control of the Democrat party in one time with
the children from the next.  A ridiculous equation.

Alexander, Grand Inquisitor, are you going to continue your PC Censorship?

I can sense and understand the frustration with the continued resistance to
experimental writing on the part of the academy, and particularly the
creative writing establishment, felt by Mark Wallace in his post (below) and
some other people.  I'm not sure why people think that the appearance of an
article in
a magazine like Lingua Franca -- and in particular *this* article -- about
the current institutional position of Language poetry, and the issues that
raises, is such an alarming symptom of or contribution to that resistance.

I feel that the way you (Mark) suggest the article should have been
approached would just have resulted in a different article with quite a
different focus.  You ask

> why isn't the Lingua Franca article about why most traditional MFA
programs can continue to blithely ignore all sorts of alternative poetries?

To put it simply, I wanted to write an article about Language poetry, not
about MFA programs (yuk).  I'm much less interested in
J. D. McClatchy and the conservative dismissal of experimental writing than
I am in the genuinely complex problems of the avant-garde vis-a-vis the
mainstream (primarily as seen from within the avant-garde itself -- thus,
the article begins with the debate WITHIN the Language world about Bob
Perelman's book).  Also, the flagrantly condescending/absurd quote from
McClatchy -- "Language poetry, like other forms of experiment, appeals more
to the young, the more innocent, those who haven't read as much and who are
attracted to glittering, moving objects" -- pretty much speaks for itself,
doesn't it? (Especially considering that plenty of not-so-young and naive
profs and poets speak out in support of LP in the article).
Who needs a whole article about how folks like him refuse to pay attention
to an interesting body of innovative work?

As Patrick Herron put it in a (much) different context, snore.

Mark wrote:
>No one asked McClatchy to defend his reason for being in a
university and ignorning major areas of American poetry.

First, since McClatchy didn't spend 20 years attacking the academy and
mainstream institutions, only to then become part of them, the question
seems less interesting and relevant than it does for avant-garde poets who
have followed this route, doesn't it?  I'd say it's more compelling to think
about why and how certain opponents/critics of such institutions have
begun to infiltrate them, what they hope to accomplish in doing so, and the
host of
issues that raises (questions discussed endlessly on this specialized list,
but not as much, I thought, in the culture at large).  And I did actually
ask McClatchy, for example, about what he thought
about poets in the academy, whether the academy harms poetry or
poets, etc., and also why he is so resistant to experimental work.
The answers were fascinating (in a car-wreck sort of way), but ultimately
they seemed tangential to the main issue: what does it mean for some
members of a self-consciously oppositional group of poets,
who for many years prided themselves on being *outside* the
academy (see the 1989 quote from Bernstein on p.48), to then become an
increasingly powerful part of it?
From the first, I hoped to show that the answers to this are very complex,
as the poets themselves seem to recognize --
and NOT a simple case of assimilation vs. purity.

Mark writes:

>So I think what some people are annoyed about (or let's just say I am) is
the fact that when the kind of work we do in poetry does come up in an
academic context at all, we're immediately accused of "selling out" ....
Why is
it the academic positions of the language poets that
are called into question instead of the academic positions of folks like
Lehman and McClatchy?

Rather than being a sign of *prejudice*, as you seem to feel, against
Language poets *by the academy or by a magazine like Lingua Franca*, "the
academic positions of the language poets" have been "called into question"
by the poets themselves (again, see the critiques of Perelman by Silliman
and others from the panel on Marginalization of Poetry in Jacket 2), and,
as any longtime member of this list knows, by
many, many people here time and again, and thus from *within* the
"avant-garde" community itself.
(For a recent example, see comments by Paul Vangelisti in Ribot 7: “much of
our cultural life is bankrupt, or perhaps worse, suffer[s] the dim fate of
calling itself disruptive, oppositional, experimental or avant-garde, when
it remains hopelessly careerist and the stuff of museums…. Whether
mainstream or avant-garde, culture in our society seeks desperately to
become institutionalized in a manner disingenuously known as ‘popular,’ i.e.
commerically youthful, revisionist, and laissez-faire”).  What I'm saying is
that these concerns about "selling out" and institutionalization are not
wielded by academics
and magazines like Lingua Franca to bar Language poets from the academy:
they are right here in our midst and deeply imbedded in the discourse and
practice of the (historical and current) avant-garde itself.

And let me just say once and for all, for the record: my article does NOT in
any way accuse any Language poets of "selling out" -- although it does quote
a few people
who feel this way, as well as people who argue that such a view is bogus
(see remarks by Marjorie P. and Alan Golding, for example -- points
conveniently ignored in
"discussions" thus far of the article).  What the piece really does is
explore different sides of a debate about the subject of assimilation,
absorption, and resistance, from both within and outside the experimental
poetry community, a debate that does seem, to me at least and to many others
here and elsewhere, to be worthy of discussion.

Finally, Mark wrote:

>To stretch a metaphor just a bit (and I know I'm doing so), compare it to
an article that was called "Can Minority Groups Assimilate into Universities
and Still Keep Their Cultural Identity?" Why wouldn't the article be called
"Why Do Universities Tell Minority Groups They Can't Keep Their Cultural
Identities If They Want to Be in Universities?"

Isn't your first hypothetical article posing a valid and interesting
question too?  Wouldn't the second piece simply be different article, one
that would be more about universities and their policies than about the
minority groups?
(again, I was interested in writing on Language poets first, the academy
second).  And, finally, the metaphor does not seem quite apt -- in what why
do you think
universities tell Language poets they can't keep their identities if they
want to be in
universities?  Has that happened to Bernstein or Perelman or Davidson or
Watten?  My own sense is no, not really -- but again, that's what the debate
in the article is all about.   What do others think?

Take care,

Andrew

>> I can see what you're saying below about the framing of the article, but
I
think the issue is a little trickier and more annoying, at least to me. I
think maybe your article does come to the conclusion that we need a new way
to
see the problem, but what's disturbing to me is that the problem is even put
in these terms at all; I know you're not the one who started it, of course.
As
if one can't be critical of the prevailing mode of operation in an
institution, or operate sometimes outside it, and then take some action
about
it from within without "selling out." The question that needs to be asked is
who would make THAT point in the first place?

So I think what some people are annoyed about (or let's just say I am) is
the
fact that when the kind of work we do in poetry does come up in an academic
context at all, we're immediately accused of "selling out." Why is that?
Obviously, because any number of MFA programs don't want us in their
programs
at all. So why isn't the Lingua Franca article about why most traditional
MFA
programs can continue to blithely ignore all sorts of alternative poetries?
Why is it the academic positions of the language poets that are called into
question, instead of the academic positions of folks like Lehman and
McClatchey? No one asked McClatchey to defend his reason for being in a
university and ignorning major areas of American poetry.

To stretch a metaphor just a bit (and I know I'm doing so), compare it to an
article that was called "Can Minority Groups Assimilate into Universities
and
Still Keep Their Cultural Identity?" Why wouldn't the article be called "Why
Do Universities Tell Minority Groups They Can't Keep Their Cultural
Identities
If They Want to Be in Universities?"?

So, whoever framed the article, my problem would be that the frame suggests
that language poets have to justify their position in the academy, whereas
the
more significant problem seems to me about the academy justifying its
continued attempt to keep language poets out.

        There is something odd beginning to seep into this discussion:

        Joel Lewis wrote--

         . . . when Iowa School writing was still ascendent and postmodern
        strategies were still SCENE as radical.

        and in quote below, from "mdw"--

        Can one still be an academic and not RIGHT critical articles in
        the
        bland prose . . .

        (emphases mine, said the stern school master, laughingingly)

        no wonder there is confusion over binaries such as that old
        (academic) quandary
        "assimilation and purity" in the face of getting or not getting an
        academic
        job--

        when there is already confusion over "RIGHT" and "write" and
        "SCENE"  and seen!


        a certain sophistry has always existed in the language poetry
        positions and attitudes and statements re langpo's and langpoets'
        relations
        with the academy.
        it's known as "wanting to have your cake and eat it, too"
        that way it is both pure and assimilated.

        how many articles for how long have appeared now on this tiring
        subject, so fraught with Clintonesque "it all depends what the meaning of
        'is' is" parsings and hair splittings and head countings?

        something is truly awry when Bob Grumman calls langpo
        "acodominant"  and this is taken as an affront, as happened on
        this list a while back


        why is it that american academics are often so shamefaced and
        crestfallen about the jobs they have?
        and so have to claim for themselves positions as radical writers,
        or thinkers or politicians or this-ists or that-ists--
        why is it that often people employed by the academy feel the need
        to bite the hand that is feeding them, by taking  muddled
        intellectualized
        anti-intellectual stances--

        and so establish themselves in their colleagues' eyes as "cutting
        edge"
        the titles of conference papers and academic/acodominant  articles
        are often
        couched in the most "transgressive" language possible
        (this is known as "having a sexy title")

        in the end the various plaints on the subject remind me of a pearl
        of wisdom found on a matchbook promoting the Winston Racing Team:

        "I told my dad I'd stopped raising Cain and he called me a
        quitter."

Hello to all, just a very brief message which I'd been meaning to send.
It's somewhat of a shame that Andrew had to come out and defend himself
against comments about an article which some of the commentators
have yet to read.  I read it a few days back and found it to be a very
smart - if limited - survey of the situation.  Andrew himself would be the
first to admit that the piece has its limitations.  But, christ, folks,
can't we get a little perspective on this before taking aim?  Lingua
Franca asked him to do it; he's not a journalist but the gig was to write
a journalist-ish piece which took into account the opinions of poet-folks
way outside LangPo Nation; so, despite the fact the he's an extremely
bright literary critic who would no doubt prefer to write a nuanced,
exploratory piece on, say, Bernstein or Hejinian, he did the job that they
asked him to do.  If a few, or a bunch, of people decide to check out
Bernstein et al b/c of it, what the hell's wrong with that?  Anyone who
thinks that J.D. McClatchy came of as "right-minded" in the piece is nuts:
McClatchy came off as the buffoon that he no doubt is (and for evidence
that he's an insipid, *awful* poet to boot, I direct you to this weeks
NYer...) As for assimilation, I once knew a punk band who's motto was, "If
we don't sell out, we get the hell out" - of course the joke was that they
wanted to sell out without changing their music one iota: and, not
surprisigly no one ever signed them.  If I'm out there doing my thing,
without tailoring it to any particular market, and someone wants to
assimilate me - well, by all means!

I *do* have some paper, so shut up: I'm trying to write,   -m.

Kathryn. I take some of the ponts you are making, and I have to admit I'm
not an expert on China, but I'll take issue with a few things you posit.
Firstly, you state that the Chinese people (or the majority) have lost faith
in communism. I think that this is quite simplistic. Have you interviewed
all (3 billion?) Chinese on there understanding of "communism"? Do they all
now reject the posibility of  a better, more democratic state in which the
populace (overall) control the means of production, and also have real
democracy in the sense that they participate (potentially if not actually)
at all levels? Have you talked to the (probably millions) of Chinese, and
even Tibetans, who have gained enormously in their living
standards,education,awareness of the scientific approach to
economics,sociology and politics that Marxist study (as against the mumbo
jumbo of idealist crap that constitutes religion and other non-Materialist
philosophy's)? How many want to sink into the kind of corrupt slime and
stench that constitutes Western  "democracy" with its Hitlers, Nixons,
racialism,homelesss and deranged people, its violence, gangs, enormous
suicide and murder rates, men and women on death row who are innocent,the
Korean and Vietnam invasion attempts by the U.S (country to first use the
nuclear bomb)into China, napalm burning and bombing, the killing of
immigrants in Germany,the Japanese aggression (the country that raped
thousands of women and used men and women as live target practice,the
country that tried to destroy China (and probably th U.S.) if thousands of
American soldiers hadnt died heroically, as did Chinese communists,
combating them, the massacres in schools, the corruption and brutality that
occurs to women in "democratic" India (women were some of the first and most
viciously enlightened revolutinaries against the corrupt landlords in
pre-revolutionary China), the vast numbers of starving, exploited, and
homeless created by the Western capitalist companies that pay fractional
wages to their workers while the rich in the West (and I include N.Z. in
this criticism) get crueler and richer? Nonsense! A report from a good
friend of mine recently back from China is that in many ways they are in
advance of the West. Open discussion groups are everywhere. There's more on
that. Secondly: If the Govt is broke, how can it, and does it continue to
operate? Third: I suspect that the struggle for "freedom" in Tibet is both
traitorous and anti-working class.Fourth: The decision-making process is
shrouded in mystery? Where is it not? Fifth:You still seem to misunderstand
that the right to free speech and workers' pay etc (if that is a problem in
China) will not be resolved without conflict and struggle, as Mao Tse Tung
pointed out. It is a typical device to point out that a state, not being
perfect,(as all are), has adopted, is attempting to adopt a system that has
"failed". As it happens, nothing fails, the word itself is a red herring, it
is a process of practice, theory, and back to practice. The system of
representations is probably tainted with corruption (as are all political
systems everywhere), but that doesnt invalidate it. The media are
continually using the phrase "the collapse of communism" when communism has
never existed. this repeated continously. So we in the West let the media do
our thinking for us. No, China needs to build astrong state in ALL senses of
that word. God help it if it gives up and allows gutless liberals talking
about "free speech" to destroy a great nation. I dont want people (like
BeiLing whoever he is) to be unneccessarily harmed, but get a grip for
chrissakes.Richard Taylor.

A little offer....in the magazine I'm running, _The Gig_, the last page is
usually filled out with a set of quick notes on contemporary poetry--mostly
identifying quotations & allusions.  For instance, pointing out that a line
of JH Prynne's in "Of Movement Towards a Natural Place" is lifted from
_Great Expectations_; that Bernstein's "The Simply" contains an extract from
James's preface to _What Maisie Knew_; that a passage from Raworth's
_Catacoustics_ is a fusion of Chandler & Hammett; &c.  There's a set of all
the N&Qs I've run, plus a few extra, up on the web at
www.geocities.com/ndorward/gignotes.html if people want to take a look. --
...Anyway, the offer is: people can send me contributions of notes
backchannel: if I use them in a subsequent issue I'll send them a free copy
of the magazine.  Contributors of notes will be credited of course.

all best --N

Rachel. Its sounds as though Britain's most rejected poet is, at least,
still not Britain's most dejected poet! Sorry.I needed some light relief
after my raving about Bei Ling etc. We all get rejected. I read an interview
with Marriane Moore, and one of her poems had been submitted about 30
times.A lot of the (now considered major) poets published themselves. Often
these poets "from the bush" or "the back streets" are quite bad.(Or we judge
them so.) I play chess and my level can be pretty accurately assesed (rated
about 1860 ELO), but how do you rate, judge, poetry? Etc.There's another
eccentric,a guy in New Zealand (Neilson Wright)who has self-published about
200 books on just about everything in N.Z literature. He "attacks" and
advises various "luminaries" in N.Z. and talks merrily on about
Postmodernism etc. His Postmodernism, from what I can gather, is the correct
one. Still its maybe a bit unfair, but the British seem to love their
ecentrics. Maybe we all do. And everyone wants their (5 minutes, 5seconds?)
of fame.I'm of English parentage so I excuse myself! As to rejections, they
hurt whether its in love or literature, but get worried when you start
rejecting yourself! This bloke might be a McGonnagal or a Shakespear, but at
least he "believes in himself". Unless he'd begun to think he WAS a
woodlice!(Sorry).Right on! Richard Taylor.

Another illusion bites the dust - or the snow -

from: Lingua Franca (Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Radio National)
October 3, 1998

"Prepositions"

Jill Kitson: Welcome to Lingua Franca. This week: preposition hunting in
the Brisbane suburbs, with grammarian, Geoff Pullum.
         ...
Geoff Pullum is a linguist who is also a satirist. The author of many books
and articles, he is probably best known in linguistic circles for his essay
collection, The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax, published in 1991, which
contains title like 'Here come the linguistic fascists' and 'The
linguistics of defamation'.

The title essay explodes the popular myth about Eskimos having lots of
different words for 'snow'.

They don't apparently, and, says Geoff Pullum, 'no-one who knows anything
about Eskimo, (or more accurately about the Inuit and Yupik families of
related languages spoken by Eskimos from Siberia to Greenland) has ever
said they do.'

More on snow, from: york@mbcrr.dfci.harvard.edu (Ian A. York)
Newsgroups: alt.fan.cecil-adams,alt.folklore.urban
Subject: Re: Words for Snow
Date: 25 Sep 1995 20:41:32 GMT

... The Pullum essay is in turn based on Martin, L. 1986. "Eskimo words for
snow": A case study in the genesis and decay of an anthropological example.
American Anthropologist, 88:418-423

And now, on with the show -)

--begin quotation--

Speaking of anthropological canards, no discussion of language and thought
would be complete without the Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax. Contrary to
popular belief, the Eskimos do not have more words for snow than do
speakers of English. They do not have four hundred words for snow, as has
been claimed in print, or two hundred, or one hundred, or forty-eight, or
even nine. One dictionary puts the figure at two. Counting generously,
experts can come up with about a dozen, but by such standards English would
not be far behind, with snow, sleet, slush, blizzard, avalanch, hail,
hardpack, powder,  flurry, dusting, and a coinage of Boston's WBZ-TV
meteorologist Bruce Schwoegler, snizzling.

Where did the myth come from? Not from anyone who has actually studied the
Yupik and Inuit-Inupiaq families of polysynthetic languages spoken from
Siberia to Greenland. The anthropologist Laura Martin has documented how
the story grew like an urban legend, exaggerated with each retelling. In
1911 Boas casually mentioned that Eskimos used four unrelated words for
snow. Whorf embellished the count to seven and implied that there were
more. His article was widely reprinted, then cited in textbooks and popular
books on language, which led to successively inflated estimates in other
textbooks, articles, and newspaper columns of Amazing Facts.

The linguist Geoffrey Pullum, who popularized Martin's article in his essay
"The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax," speculates about why the story got so
out of control: "The alleged lexical extravagances of the Eskimos comports
so well with the many other facets of their polysynthetic perversity:
rubbing noses; lending their wives to strangers; eating raw seal blubber;
throwing Grandma out to be eaten by polar bears." It is an ironic twist.
Linguistic complexity came out of the Boas school, as part of a campaign to
show that nonliterate cultures were as complex and sophisticated as
European ones. But the supposedly mind-broadening anecdotes owe their
appeal to a patronizing willingness to treat other psychologies as weird
and exotic compared to our own. As Pullman notes,

<Pullman quote begins>
         Among the many depressing things about this credulous transmission
and elaboration of a false claim is that even if there *were* a large
number of words for snow in some Arctic language, this would *not*,
objectively speaking, be intellectually interesting; it would be a most
mundane and unremarkable fact.  Horsebreeders have various names for
breeds, sizes, and ages of horses; botanists have names for leaf shapes;
interior decorators have names for shades of mauve; printers have many
different names for fonts (Carlson, Garamond, Helvetica, Times Roman, and
so on), naturally enough ... Would anyone think of writing about printers
the kind of slop we find written about Eskimos in bad linguistics
books?  Take [the following] random textbook ..., with its earnest
assertion "It is quite obvious that in the culture of the Eskimos ... snow
is of great enough importance to split up the conceptual sphere that
correspond to one word and one thought in English into several distinct
classes ...,"  Imagine reading: "It is quite obvious that in the culture of
printers ... fonts are of great enough importance to split up the
conceptual sphere that corresponds to one word and one thought among
non-printers into several distinct classes ..."
<Pullman quote ends>

Utterly boring, even if true.  Only the link to those legendary,
promiscuous, blubber-gnawing hunters of the ice-packs could permit
something this trite to be presented to us for contemplation.

This was sent to me (josh) by mark lord....thought i'd pass it on......
he is looking for actors to help with this large project, (see below)
also thought i'd mention i saw The Wounded Body at Christ Church, and it was
pretty cool
i also liked the Visual Fringe storefront window at Larry Becker gallery
and worth mentioning is that the Cabaret is at 211 Race st, around the back!,
it is the Lithograph Building at 2nd and Race
And the show, In The Shadow Of The Glen will probably be pretty good, it is
at the ericson gallery, 53 N. 2nd st., 9/2, 9/3, 9/9, 9/15, 9/16 at 7pm   $10
 (pg. 42 in the guide)

Thanks for the kind words re: ACROSS. For the record, there are about 35
sites--and everyone in the audience sees em all. There are, though, four
different actors playing the main character...and the audience divides into
4 groups, each group following one character. So there are four different
(complementary) structures for the piece...and four somewhat different
conceptions of the main character (played by David Warner, Maggie Siff,
Katie Figueroa, and Mario Cotto).

If people want to see it multiple times, the 1st time is 15$, the second is
10$, the third is 5$...and the fourth (and all subsequent) show is FREE.

I'm also looking for a few actors to substitute for some ACROSS folks who
have commitments to be in other shows. If you know of anyone who's
interested, they can email me, or call BIG HOUSE @ 215-601-1165.

Again, thanks for helping get the word out.

Myself and some of the folks at www.webartery.com have just started a new
project I thought you might find interesting and perhaps wish to participate
in.

The Webartery Chat Network idea is pretty simple: each participating
artist/site puts up a page on their site that's based on a template chat
page. So each artist's site allows them and visitors to their site to enter
a common IRC chat room (accessible via the Web or an IRC client such as mIRC
or Ircle etc). One such page is at www.webartery.com/webarterychat.

We're using a free chat server supplied by the good folks at quickchat.org.
IRC chat allows people to converse real-time via typed text.

The chat room provides a conduit between the various participating sites.
There's a link on each chat page to a page that provides links to the
participating sites, all of which are web.art/net.work related. The
hyperlink can provide a link from one site to another. But links via a chat
network, hopefully, add a special touch to the connection between the sites,
a more intimate and living link, conduit, corridor between the sites and
also through web.art/net.work.

Having a chat room on your own site also allows you to converse with the
people visiting your site. Since you can connect to the chat room not only
via the Web but also through Mirc, etc., you can set mIRC up to beep each
time someone enters the chat room. So you can be doing other things and
still be notified when someone enters the room, if you like.

It also allows the participating artists to converse with one another
informally. When you log on, maybe someone's in the room, maybe not. So it
helps communication between artists for collaborative projects together.
Chat has also been used for collaborative real time improvisational theatre
and other projects (by Janan Platt and others at www.xdrom.com). It's a Web
specific form. The folks at Webartery have also done a series of interviews
with Web artists in an IRC show called Defib at www.webartery.com/defib.
That project ended a few months ago.

Net.art/web.art, what have you, is based in this new communications medium.
Isn't it ultimately about communication between people? IRC adds a dimension
to the communications of 'art', to the possibilities for art/action and for
presence on the Web.

It will be interesting to see what comes of the project. If you're
interested in participating, drop me a line at jim@vispo.com.

Regards,
Jim Andrews

Barbara, I hope you remember me.  We nearly arranged a reading for you at
SUNY Farmingdale where I am the Artistic Director of the Visiting Writers
Program.  But unfortunately the date proved unworkable.  You did send me a
signed copy of Stripped Tales for which I will always be grateful.  Your
message conveyed the hope that we would someday meet.  I share that hope.
You remain one of my favorite poets OF ALL TIME (with apologies to Mohammed
Ali).  You're a champ, and I wish you all possible champion sized pleasures.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Barbara!!   William James Austin

Hi everyone.  Murat Nemet-Nejat, I don't think you're being quite
fair to Mark Wallace, though three of his sentences taken out of
context may strike you as "a parody of academic prose."  He's a very
fine thinker and writer and the topic (standardized academic prose
and how to bend it) is one he's spent a long time thinking about.
Isn't this, the Poetics List, the place where he should be encouraged
to share his ideas with the rest of us?  I've read a lot of nonsense
that seems to be academic prose parodying itself, but Wallace is
relatively clear and straightforward, except when he wants to be I
guess.  So, I sympathize with your anger, I just feel it's
misdirected in this one instance.

Aldon Nielsen, asking about Andrew Epstein "do we know this guy"
sounds like we on the List are one big xenophobic clan but maybe
you're being ironic about our place in the vast scheme of things.
Having read the article in question, I urge all to borrow a copy of
"Lingua Franca" and read the piece, otherwise you won't get a clear
idea of what Epstein is trying to do, not from the reports here.  In
a way it's a little unusual for "Lingua Franca" to print such an
article, for no one was sued, no one denied tenure, no charges of
plagiarism or sexual harassment were brought.  The truth is, Epstein
consistently treats people with a great deal of respect, and I know,
for example, that if they had hired ME to write the article it would
have been a good deal bloodier and more sensational.  Can't blame
Epstein for the sensational lead-ins and pull-quotes invented by the
editors.  Like Mark Wallace, Epstein is a fine writer and a very good
poet.  His book "A Possible House" is excellent, romantic, sensual,
very evocative and clever, he's like the Helen Frankenthaler of
poetry, you just want to sink into that language and lounge.  On the
third hand I've been reading his article (in "Raritan") about Frank
O'Hara's poem "Choses Passageres" and I can confirm he's a terrific
scholar.  We live in an age of great O'Hara scholarship but Epstein's
article ("Frank O'Hara's Translation Game") is simply breathtaking
with its combination of thoughtful analysis and the old-fashioned
textual research that, in this case, should have made headlines--in
this case, Epstein's discovery that, in composing this poem, his only
poem in French, O'Hara consulted a particular French-English
dictionary that, once newly re-consulted as Epstein does, explains in
every instance, from line to line, O'Hara's seemingly bizarre and
stilted French expressions.  Oh well, enough from me for a while . .
.

We all know people who used to belong to the Poetics List and then
dropped off because they were frightened or humiliated due to the
natural heat and disputatiousness of our give and take here.  I know
I'm on this one other list, "alt-music kylie-minogue," where they're
even more vociferous than we are here!  But that's because they're
talking about one topic all the time, the great genius of the
Melbourne superstar Kylie Minogue, not ranging all over the world
through all periods of poetic history for their light and limits.

Sex with Albert Einstein

He moves slowly, old
as he is, and German.
This is not wasted time, though he
could be groping with theories
of unity
but for now, gravity is
separate from us.

There is no light,
we are blind, the unused power of
our eyes ringing like black bells.
I said: "I don't want to be alone."

When his eyes are open, they ask
"Are you less alone
when you can see me here?"
Unify.

We are light, almost weightless:
the aether he proved didn't exist.
But for a time,
we believed in it.

He sent the Nobel money to
his wife. She deserved it:
he was not kind to her. She said:
"I am starved for love
and wicked science is the enemy."

I know, my Albert is
with me when he is with me,
and entirely absent otherwise.
Love enters through the mouth.
I will love him and starve
as well.

Some men are married to space.
Some men are married to time.
Unify.
Love is a roll of the dice.
It does not cure the need for science
any more than science cures the need for love.






SSI

I learned
to get by on luck
and spaghetti
to hide the earthquake
of my revulsion
at how much I
need their money;
I rent my life
from these nice ladies
at windows "C" and "E",
I already knew
how to lie.
I learned gratitude
for they have
relieved me of
the burden of possessions,
my eyes are too big
for my bookshelf anyway.
I learned to pretend
that money in the
mail is sexy, to try
to relax while knowing
that no check equals
Apocalypse Next Month,
to relax at their
surprise inquisitions
that dot my life like
morse code, just to
frisk me for any
extra nickels I didn't
report to them.
You want to know fear
see the window ladies
when they get mean,
their faces dry
and whithered as with
a weeks sunshine;
they hold my cigarette money
in the balance.
Truth is, I am the infant
and they are the tit
I suck when they let me
and I have not yet
grown the teeth
with which
to bite.

not commonly grouped together: black writers from the United States and
the Caribbean and the so-called Black Mountain poets. Although they are
seemingly disparate, these writers are united by their experimentation
with style and form. Mackey, an important contemporary poet and critic,
focuses on the experimental aspects of their work rather than on its
subject matter or authorship to show that they all share an implied
critique of conventional poetic practices.

Mackey analyzes the work of Black Mountain poets Robert Duncan, Robert
Creeley, and Charles Olson, African American poets Amiri Baraka and
Clarence Major, and Caribbean writers Edward Kamau Brathwaite and Wilson
Harris. He
Frequently brings the work of these authors into dialogue and
juxtaposition, noting the parallels and counterpoint that exist among
writers normally separated by ethnic, temporal, or regional boundaries.
By insisting that their experimentation unites these writers rather than
marginalizes them, Mackey questions traditional notions that underlie
conventional perceptions and practice.

"Insisting on the political importance of radical innovation without the
trappings of intellectual fashion, tempered by an awareness of the
historical scale of his assertions, and challenging liberal notions of
cultural pluralism and artistic opposition, Nathaniel Mackey makes an
important, sophisticated contribution to current debates about cultural
diversity and the political relevance of experimental writing."
-Contemporary Literature

"Nathaniel Mackey has accomplished his task admirably. Discrepant
Engagement demands from us an openness to alternative frames of
reference and a recognition of the ways in which traditional categories
restrict our own perceptions of the potential for intertextuality among
cultures, literary schools, races, regions, and rubrics."       -African
American Review

Nathaniel Mackey is Professor of Literature at the University of
California, Santa Cruz.

Announcing the latest volume in the series Modern and Contemporary
Poetics, edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank Lazer

Extraordinary Measures
Afrocentric Modernism and 20th-Century American Poetry
Lorenzo Thomas

This broad overview by an established poet and cultural critic reveals
the rich tapestry of African American poetry as it has emerged over the
past century.

Basing his study on literary history, cultural criticism, and close
readings, Thomas revives and appraises the writings of a number of this
century's most important African American poets, including Margaret
Walker, Amiri Baraka, Askia M. Toure, Harryette Mullen, and Kalamu ya
Salaam. Thomas analyzes the work of Fenton Johnson within the context of
emerging race consciousness in Chicago, contributes to critical
appraisals of William Stanley Braithwaite and Melvin B. Tolson, and
examines the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Throughout the
book, Thomas demonstrates the continuity within the Afrocentric
tradition while acknowledging the wide range of stylistic approaches and
ideological stances that the tradition embraces.

Written with intelligence and humor, his book is itself an extraordinary
measure that reflects years of scholarship and opens up African American
poetry to a wider audience.

"Here is the poet in the catbird seat. Long a maker of literary history,
Lorenzo Thomas pauses now to give readers a report of the story so far,
his accounting of some of America's most significant poetic past. Seldom
has our writing had such an attentive reader. This is not the history
you thought you knew, nor is Lorenzo Thomas your grandfather's
poet-critic. Thomas's Extraordinary Measures essays a measure of the
American idiom as it has sounded in our century."

Thanks to the careful objections of John Tranter and other
subscribers, which encouraged further research on my part,
the list owner and myself have decided that introducing
Hypertext Markup Language to the list constitutes too great
a security risk for subscribers, being too easy a conductor
of computer viri (or viruses, whichever your preference in
making the plural). Therefore, as of today we have elected
to suspend the use of HTML tags on the list indefinitely.

This change will require some assistance from all of you,
not only in, as I would recommend, reverting to the text-only
digest, but also with regard to compliance. It has in the
past been my endeavor, imperfectly executed, not to send
HTML to the list; a measure allowed by the fact that the
list is moderated. And it was chiefly in response to the
increasing number of list messages formatted in HTML, which
required manual editing, that I moved to allow the format to
be distributed to the list. Now that we have discovered
the risky nature of this style of email, I must ask that
all subscribers using an 'advanced' email application such
as Eudora, Pegasus Mail, Microsoft Outlook, Netscape
Communicator and the like specify, in the "Preferences" box
of that application (usually under the "File" menu) to
send messages in text-only or ASCII format. Those using
more basic programs such as PINE or ELM, or stripped-down
applications such as Mulberry need make no change.

I have requested to the Computing and Information Technology
office at UB that they write for me a program that will
automatically respond to messages on detection of HTML tags.
In the mean time - I say hopefully - I will rely upon all of
you for help in keeping the list free of HTML.

Thanks, Chris

My apologies for the intermittency of list service
over this week. The semester has just begun here at

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics List was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its second incarnation,
the list carries over 800 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time.
A number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
at the Electronic Poetry Center (see section 10 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the increasing
number of subscribers, we are no longer able to maintain the
open format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).
All submissions are reviewed by the moderators in keeping with
the goals of the list, as articulated in this Welcome Message.
We remain committed to this editorial function as a defining
element of the Poetics List. Our aim is to support, inform, and
extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of
the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
impossible.

For further information on posting to the list, see sections 3 and 4.
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 8.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 8
for details.

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project. For subscription information
or to contact the moderators, write to <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list should provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators
at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all
of the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and send this one-line message, with no "subject" line
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name. If you
find that it is not possible to unsub using your old address,
please contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by
contacting the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by
the moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated
in this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. Feel
free to query the list moderators if you are uncertain as to whether
a message is appropriate. All correspondence with the editors
regarding submissions to the list remains confidential and should
be directed to us at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published,
or in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core
function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications
are always welcome. We also welcome discussions of poetry and poetics
in keeping with the editorial function of the list.

Solicited contributions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) may
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The moderators reserve
the right to contact any subscriber regarding possible contributions.

Send messages to the list directly to the list address:

     <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 4 below.
Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 9.

-------------------

4. Cautions

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post, since this may make it
difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.
Messages containing attachments will be presumed to be
worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Posting on the list is a form of publication. However, please do
not publish list postings without the express permission of the author!
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without
the author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair
use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 5 messages
per day from any one subscriber; in general, we expect subscribers
to keep their post to less than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is
a manageable list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers)
of twenty-five or fewer messages per day.

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat offenders
will be removed from the list immediately. Please do not put this
policy to test!

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the moderators at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

5. Subscription Options

It is possible to receive the Poetics List as separate posts
or as daily digests. When you subscribe, the default setting is
"regular," meaning you will receive a separate email for each
message distributed to the list.

Regular:
The default option, this is the form in which you will receive
the list if you choose no other. With a "regular" subscription,
you receive individual postings immediately, as they are OK'd
by the list moderator. To revert to this option if you are
currently receiving the list in digest form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain the following text:

     set poetics nodigest

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

Digest:
With a "digest" subscription, you receive larger messages (called
"digests") at regular intervals, usually once per day. These "digests"
are collections of individual list postings. Some lists are so active
that they produce several digests daily; the Poetics List produces
only one, mailed just after midnight EST.

Digests are a good compromise between reading everything as it is
posted and feeling like the list is clogging your mailbox with a
multitude of individual postings.

To receive the Poetics List in digest form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain the following text:

     set poetics digest

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

Index:
With an "index" subscription, you receive a short "index" message
once per day. These "indexes" show you what is being discussed on
the list without including the text of the individual postings. For
each posting, the date, the author's name and address, the subject
of the message and the number of lines it comprises is listed. You
can then follow instructions provided in the index to download
messages of interest from the server.

An index subscription is ideal if you have a slow connection and
only read a few hand-picked messages. The indexes are very short
and you do not have to worry about long download times. The drawback
of course is that you need to maintain your internet connection or
reconnect to order messages of interest from the server.

You can choose to have the index sent to you in either a traditional
format (plain text) or in HTML format with hyperlinks. Using the HTML
index, you may click on a link provided with each message to open your
web browser to that message in the Poetics List archive.

To receive the Poetics List in index form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain, for the text-only
index:

     set poetics nohtml index

And for the hyper-link index:

     set poetics html index

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Please do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

     set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 9 below.)

-------------------

7. "No Review" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information.

-------------------

8. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

The EPC's mission is to serve as a gateway to the extraordinary

Too Little, Too Late?  Acknowledging the Nazi Holocaust's "Other" Victims

What: Free Panel Discussion and Public Dialogue
When: September 26, 2000 at 7pm (screenings of Paragraph 175 at 5pm and 9pm)
Where: Castro Theater, 429 Castro Street, San Francisco
Admission: Free to the public

Sponsored by the Goethe-Institut, The Jewish Museum San Francisco in
conjunction with Telling Pictures / Reflective Image and the screening at
the Castro Theater of PARAGRAPH 175, A Rob Epstein / Jeffrey Freidman Film,
from September 15 - 28, 2000.

San Francisco, CA - Fifty-five years after the end of World War II, public
awareness of Nazi persecution remains limited primarily to the suffering of
Jews under the Third Reich.  Without minimizing in any way the enormity of 6
million Jewish deaths, the historical record cries out for a more complete
understanding of organized oppression during Hitler's regime.  Alongside
Jews in the Nazi Holocaust were homosexuals, people with disabilities (both
physical and mental), members of the Roma and Sinti people (formerly
referred to as Gypsies), Jehovah's Witnesses, and political prisoners.
While their numbers were much smaller than those imprisoned or murdered as
Jews, their suffering was equal.

In recent years however, serious efforts been made in Germany and in the
United States to compensate gay and disabled victims, with Roma/Sinti and
other groups barely eliciting acknowledgment in the public eye.  The issues
raised are deep ones: Does the emergence of further "victim groups" diminish
the suffering of Jews?  Will the German government be subjected to an
endless burden of remorse and reparations?  Does acknowledging the "other"
victims come too little, too late?
(more)
To tackle these issues head-on, the Goethe-Institut of San Francisco, The
Jewish Museum San Francisco and Telling Pictures / Reflective Image are
sponsoring a panel discussion and public dialogue, to be held in conjunction
with the screening of the new documentary Paragraph 175, which explores the
fate of homosexuals under Nazism.  As part of their educational mission, the
Goethe-Institut and The Jewish Museum San Francisco have invited scholars
and activists to join in a public dialogue on the latest efforts to
recognize and compensate non-Jewish victims of Nazi persecution.  Confirmed
participants include Julie Dorf, former director of the International Gay
and Lesbian Human Rights Commission; Jim Lichti, historian, formerly
employed by the Shoah Foundation to focus on non-Jewish victims; members of
the Paragraph 175 film team; and additional participants TBA.  Peter L.
Stein, Director of Exhibitions at the Jewish Museum San Francisco, will
moderate the panel.

Paragraph 175 is a feature documentary built around personal stories of
homosexual men who experienced persecution under the Nazis.  Their filmed
testimonies tell an epic story, made vivid with evocative images from the
period and original, haunting images shot for this film.  These are complex
individuals-often bitter, but just as often filled with irony and humor,
haunted by their memories, but determined to survive.  Their collective
story fills a crucial gap in the historical record, and is a testament to
human resilience in the face of unconscionable cruelty.  The film is
produced and directed by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman.

The Jewish Museum San Francisco is dedicated to exploring Jewish identity
through exhibitions, educational and public programs.  To better serve the
community The Jewish Museum is building a new home in the Yerba Buena Center
arts district, slated to open in 2003.  From October 12, 2000  - January 4,
2001, the Museum will feature architect Daniel Libeskind's designs, models
and computer renderings of the new building project at its current location
on 121 Steuart Street (between Mission and Howard) in San Francisco.  For
more information on upcoming exhibitions or the new building project, please
visit www.jmsf.org or call 415-591-8824.

The Goethe-Institut, German Cultural Center in San Francisco, organizes a
variety of programs in the arts and humanities, which reflect artistic
exchange and promote Germany in all areas of cultural life, creating
dialogue, and building upon existing partnerships. The language division
offers intensive German courses in San Francisco and Germany, workshops and
teaching material for teachers of German.  The library serves as a resource
center and our homepage includes extensive links to other providers of
information about Germany - http://www.goethe.de/sanfrancisco

my wife, Louise, was expressing some dissatisfaction with the e-habit of
indicating irony with <Ir> and thought up the emoticon

<l...

which looks a bit like an electric iron, the dotty lead being suggestively
open ended.

Then she thought, is this one of those ideas I and about five million other
people have at the same time?

Dear Barbara Guest:

When I listen to your poetry I hear the sound of a cymbal being struck. It
is one of those much prized "old K" cymbals made in Istanbul, dark and
complex in its tessitura.  The first impression is one of delicacy, an
unworldy and almost unbearable subtlely in the interplay between the
brightly articulated sticking pattern and the underlying "wash" or
"spread." The beat is elliptical, more implied than stated, for the casual
listener perhaps even impossible to discern.  Yet to describe this sound
as ethereal or rarified would be an oversimplification. It is hard-edged,
witty, and luminous, never fragile or brittle.

Listening to this poetry is one of the most satisfying aesthetic
experiences imaginable.

Small Press Traffic is moving:

We're moving this week to glamorous, tidy new digs at the just-completed
San Francisco campus of the California College of Arts & Crafts!  Most of
our events will be held at their Timkens Lecture Hall, and our archive will
be housed in their library. Please come see us at 1111 Eighth Street --
near the intersection of 16th and Wisconsin -- And remember, our radical,
elegant charm will never change -- except in that change is part of it!
And of course change is never easy -- all of us at SPT are deeply grateful
to New College for its generosity in hosting us these past five years, a
generosity which has made our continued success possible.

Our fall reading series begins Friday, September 29 at 7:30 pm with
readings by Rae Armantrout and Carol Mirakove. Hope to see some of you
there!!

you who have not been introduced to us yet - Double Helix is a licensed =
cabaret artspace in the heart of the Fortitude Valley entertainment =
precinct in Brisbane, Australia. Our current program includes - film =
screenings, dj's, bands, dance, physical theatre, exhibitions with a =
focus on art and technology, performance art and spectacle. We currently =
operate as a collective of artists who have experience in film =
production, visual art, theatre, music and interactive visual systems.=20

Mentor Program has a [co]:installation

[co]:installation is an exhibition by Freya Pinney and Di Ball in =
interconnected rooms at Double Helix, opening Saturday 9 September at =
6pm and continuing until 21 September. The exhibition is the outcome of =
their project partnership through the Youth Arts Queensland Mentor =
Program. Both works explore notions of transgression between bodies, =
text and images and [co]:installation is a satellite event as part as =
the Multimedia Arts Asia Pacific (MAAP) festival 2000.


Freya Pinney=92s work will present a digitally enhanced performance of =
tongue writing, projected and sequenced as a text. The script performed =
will involve an exploration of unexplainable moments throughout history. =
The silent execution of writing with the tongue as the brush produces =
exciting and challenging visual images.


Di Ball will use digitally manipulated images to expand her ongoing =
"pink bits" project which has involved a long-term process of the artist =
mapping her own body in a range of visual imagery. The work in this show =
will add an exploration and documentation of the artist=92s life and =
experiences past and present to the mapping process.=20

co_installation@hotmail.com=20

combined with digital manipulation to evoke a distorted, motion filled =
sense of the place and the performances which have occured within the =
space over the first three months of operation. Based on photographs of =
events held at Double Helix, these images show captive moments of action =
in black and white - displaying incidences remembered and incidences =
unseen as flashes of the recent past.

I'm very happy to say that my poetry book, _Aleatory Allegories_, is now =
out from Salt in the UK and Australia, with distribution in the USA (dot =
coms and Ingram).  The cover design is by Gaye Chan, who does most of =
the Tinfish covers.  Unlike most of her covers, however, all of these =
are the same and they never contained food...

My next book will likely be titled DEET, after my newly adopted son's =
universal word.  Sangha (almost 14 mos.)notices everything but =
everything and calls it DEET (or DIT or DAT).

       Deep South Festival of Writers 2000

     The Deep South Festival of Writers, one of the oldest
and most prestigious writers conferences in the United
States, announces its 40th annual fall festival, October
12-15, 2000 at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette. 2000
marks the fourth decade of the Deep South Festival of
Writers, as well as the centennial anniversary of the
University of Louisiana at Lafayette. To commemorate the
coincidence of these special events, this fall the Festival
will showcase Louisiana writers, artists, and the Louisiana
setting in literature and the creative imagination. We
encourage all patrons of the arts, painters, musicians,
book-lovers, bar-napkin poets, and anyone else with an
impulse towards artistic expression, to join us in the
four-day celebration.

     Each year, the Deep South Festival affirms the value of
literary arts and creative endeavors in Acadiana by
featuring public performances, panel discussions, craft
lectures, and exhibitions from a host of artists across the
nation. By providing local artists and the community at
large with nationally and world-renowned artists, the
festival commemorates and encourages the urge towards
writing and artistic expression. At the 40th Annual Fall
Festival, Deep South will present writers in readings and
craft lectures in a wide array of genres, from drama to
poetry, from fiction to folklore. In addition to these
scheduled events, the conference will also feature the
following special additions:

     A dramatic reading of “Interview," an original play by
UL resident playwright Dayana Stetco.

     Paroles et musique, a blend of music and verse
performed in French by local Acadian poets.

     A panel discussion featuring editors from a variety of
literary journals, including Transition (Harvard’s
international journal), Connecticut Review, Southern Review,
Louisiana Literature, and New Orleans Review, among others.

     A book fair of local presses.

     A panel discussion exploring the use of folklore in
creative writing.

     A panel devoted to the teaching of writing across all
educational levels.

     Featured participants will include poet Jean Arceneaux,
poet Darrell Bourque, short story writer Tim Gautreaux, poet
David Cheramie, literary agent Caroline Carney, poet Debbie
Clifton, Baton Rouge native and fiction writer Tim Parrish,
poet Skip Fox, novelist Ernest Gaines, short story writer
Tim Gautreaux, nationally renowned folklorist Henry Glassie,
poet Jerry McGuire, poet and translator Burton Raffel, poet
Zachary Richard, poet Vivian Shipley, dramatist Dayana
Stetco, and editor Michael Vasquez.

     This incredible line-up of talent will gather together
only once: this October in the Deep South Festival of
Writers. Don’t miss the opportunity to join in the
celebration. For more information, please contact Dr. George

"The phrase 'bread and circuses' has become a commonplace to describe how

classes were able to avoid social unrest....a society begins to rely heavily

on leisure--and especially passive leisure--only when it has become

incapable of offering meaningful productive occupation to its members.  Thus

'bread and circuses' is a ploy of last resort that postpones the dissolution

of a society only temporarily."

The Electronic Literature Directory (http://directory.eliterature.org) is a
unique and valuable new resource for readers and writers of digital texts.
Created and maintained by the Electronic Literature Organization, this
searchable database provides the most comprehensive reference tool available
anywhere for electronic literature. Currently the Directory catalogs over
360
authors, 560 works, and 80 publishers. The descriptive entries cover poetry,
fiction, drama, and nonfiction that makes significant use of electronic
techniques or enhancements.

The Directory provides easy access to one of the most exciting and
fastest-growing bodies of cutting-edge literature. Among the new forms of
writing represented here are hypertexts and other interactive pieces,
kinetic or
animated poems, multimedia works, generated texts, and works that allow
reader
collaboration. Directory users can also enjoy the enhancements that the new
technology brings to traditional literature, such as streaming audio
readings of
poetry by masters ranging from e.e. cummings and Dylan Thomas to
contemporary
Pulitzer Prize winners.

The Directory contains live links to Web works, publishing sites, and author
home pages, making it a prime portal for readers. Users can search the
Directory
for individual authors or works, or they can browse numerous categories
such as
poetry, fiction, hypertext, or animated text. More-sophisticated search and
selection capabilities will be added in the future, letting users find
works by
specifying virtually any attribute, from the language of the text to the
distribution medium (Web, disk, etc.). Another future enhancement will be
the
addition of reviews and reader recommendations to listings.

Authors and publishers listed in the Directory can edit their own listings
to
ensure accuracy and completeness. If you are an author or publisher, we
encourage you to contact us at directory@eliterature.org for your account
information so you can edit your existing listings and add new ones for
yourself. If your work isn't in the Directory but should be, let us know so
we
can rectify the mistake. The collaboration of authors, publishers, and ELO
staff
in maintaining content will ensure that the Directory is always
comprehensive,
accurate, and up to date.

The Directory is currently in a publicly accessible beta form. Some bugs are
still present, some planned features have not yet been implemented, and not
all
data has been checked for accuracy. During the beta period we are seeking
user
feedback. Please inform us of any problems you encounter.

Short of getting into an ever-widening spiral of ad hominems regarding
purported "delusions," I can only return to my point, conveniently passed
over by you, that the states under discussion are instruments of domination.
That's neither the politics of a Gore-touting erstwhile reformer, nor of a
cheerleader for the Texas serial killer and dynastic scion. Nor, really, of
an optimistic social-democratic Naderite.

To your question:

Why do you attack Republican philosophy and blame that party for acts you
call tyrannical by the Federal Government and its police?

I'll keep my answer within the narrow bounds of personal experience: someone
gassed and beaten in vitro by Nixon's hired goons, who grew up to receive
his first identifying scar at the hands of one of (Republican) Bob Martinez'
Florida state troopers during a nonviolent civil action, might be somewhat
justified in placing a certain amount of blame in that direction. But no
fear, it's an equal opportunity attack: Lawton Chiles' state troopers kicked
my ass too. And Clinton and Gore have been as instrumental as Reagan in
busting up the social movements (and the civil society) that gave those I
care for a measure of hope. In my neck of the woods, we talk about Clinton's
presidency as years 13-20 of the Reagan/Bush administration.

But this has become really tiresome, especially as it's taken shape in my
attempt to produce a rebuttal to what was simply your placing of words in my
mouth. (Read my initial post: I never mentioned Republicanism as the locus
of the problems I was identifying, nor did I make any mention of voting for
Gore). Reluctant as I am to join those who can be counted on to groan at
every mention of politics on the list, I'm going to absent myself from
further discussion of this until your posts come up to argument from their
current level of blank assertion (with emphatic caps, no less - nice touch).

Pray tell me.  Why, then, if you vote, you will likely vote Gore?  Why do
you attack Republican philosophy and blame that party for acts you call

The reason you will vote Gore/Clinton is that you believe in a set of what I
call Liberal political visions that will lead inevitably to their EXACT
OPPOSITE.  For instance, ALL of the WOMEN who stood up to the Big HEE or
A.A. Gore are now being AUDITED by the IRS! But of course this inconvenient

writers on this line and the line's administration. As a RadLib feminist
poet in Boulder said, "I want women to have power in government, not Jean
Kirkpatrick."  Who on this line even remembers Jean Kirkpatrick?

In other words, regardless of your NICE words, ostensibly reasonable, your
vision will lead to even MORE government in the US of the sort you say you
deplore. WHY?  Because it is the type of intellectual who dominates this
Line that runs China today!  The peasants who now REVOLT against Zemin
revolt against an intellectual class of people who think like MANY on this
LINE!

If you took the time to really understand Republicanism, you could make it
work to attain the justices you seek.  More poets should adopt Republicanism
as their vehicle for the kind of freedom they supposedly embody.  I say:
To hell with Ernesto Cardinale and the poetry of Mao Zedung.  Forget it.
State run poetry is an oxymoron!  Get back into the more sophisticated and
grounded views of Frost.

Nearly all of the talk I see on this line attempts to reform the evermore
tyrannical Federal administration of the country by even MORE of it, simply
replacing the hand of one deluded Liberal generation with another, one
radical clique that seized control of the Democrat party in one time with

I worry about the invocation of sanity in your attempt to solidify the
distinction between pleasure and disgust. Certainly - and without going into
any embarrassing personal detail - there are plenty of us in the world whose
experience of what get called "perversions" is exactly this coincidence of
intense pleasure and intense disgust. And no, I don't think that's simply
internalized self-loathing at the enactment of socially proscribed
practices, aesthetic, sexual or otherwise. The rounding up of that
experience under the heading of "insanity" might have (has had) some pretty
dangerous social consequences, no?

[As an aside, I'd recommend a look at Samuel R. Delany's novel The Mad Man
for a rigorous narrative examination of an aesthetics of pleasurable
disgust. Or passages in Dodie Bellamy's The Letters of Mina Harker. Or or
or...]

I think I agree with much of what Jacques Debrot wrote below--
but why redefine pleasure as "intense feeling?"  All intense feeling is
not pleasure.  I can see intense feeling, or emotive intensity, being
considered more important, in a poem, than whether that intesnity is
pleasurable or painful; I can also understand how one might derive
pleasure FROM an intense negative feeling--but that wouldn't make the
latter pleasure, only something from which pleasure could be derived.

In my aesthetics figuring out how this could be is important, by the
way, the main expression of the question being: what do we get out of
tragedy?  One thought: tragedy acts as a counter-irritant; another is
that an artwork, in containing something painful, or subduing it,
produces a kind of pleasurable victory over pain.

Anyway, my bottom line is that the ultimate function of art is to give
people pleasure.  Aesthetic pleasure.  Disgust IS the opposite of
pleasure.  An artwork that elicits only disgust cannot be pleasurable
(or desired by anyone sane); art that works with that which disgusts
must somehow achieve something pleasurable in spite of that, not FROM
it.

richard -

1.  I don't think Taylor was supporting more government at all.

2.  Though the Republican Party wishes you to believe otherwise, they are at
least as supportive of more government as the Democrats.  Their deregulatory
efforts are directed solely at reducing overhead for corporations.  If
anyone remembers welfare reform it should be interesting to note that it
came with increased regulations.  Why?  It's a social program, not a
corporate program.  Republicans may not outspend Democrats on social issues
but they certainly do outspend Democrats on the military.  And military
spending is almost 1/2 of our total annual spending.  But the differences
between the two parties are minimal in both categories.  Both generally
increase military spending and decrease social spending.  Both generally
deregulate controls surrounding corporations and increase regulations
surrounding social programs.  Both generally seem to wish to make a bigger
military (more government) while looting the american tax base and funneling
those gains to their soft-money donor-friends in the big corporations.
republicans tend to loot faster (which they call 'less government') but on
less taxes.  which means they loot a greater percentage of your tax dollar.
so they don't need as much taxes as the Democrats who are going to loot more
slowly on a larger tax base by making it look like they are the friends of
the people.  but again let me stress the differences between the two are
marginal at best.

3.  The core of your argument here can be reduced to two premises and its
conclusion.

"... it is the type of intellectual who dominates this Line that runs China
today!"

" ... your vision will lead to even MORE government in the US...."


translation:
person who says intellectual things runs china
china is a "more government" country (implicit)
therefore intellectuals bring about "more government"

this is a highly specious argument, to say the least.  perhaps some
intellectuals in china also do not support the chinese government (though it
may be dangerous to do so).  perhaps intellectuals in china are diverse.
perhaps the intellectual climate in china is not exemplary of the
intellectual climate in america.

intellectuals do seem to be involved in political revolutions on both sides
everywhere throughout history.  brainy people figure out how to control
things.  no surprise there.  but perhaps brainy people can also figure out
how *not* to control things (which may equal "more government").  one need
only read shunryu suzuki or bakunin to see this.  "Do you want to make it
impossible for anyone to oppress his fellow-man? Then make sure that no one
shall possess power."   Bakunin, an intellectual, wrote these words.  Surely
he too was not speaking for more government.  but you suggest he is
backhandedly suggesting more government?  hmm.

let's see.  if someone says something intellectual, he is supporting more
government.  what is it to say something intellectual?  primarily it is
someone saying something that some other people do not understand
immediately.  but all people are capable of saying something that excludes
others. so all people can speak intellectually and participate in some form
of intellectualism or others.  (i've heard many complex analyses of NFL
games, for example, by people not commonly called "intellectual" because
they might not have college degrees or they have blue collar jobs, etc.)
this leads us to your subtle conclusion that, since intellectuals are for
more government, and since all people are really intellectuals, it follows
that all people are for "more government."

I don't think I agree with this argument either.  because the first premise
is patently false.

China deserves condemnation.  America deserves condemnation.  Yes.  But in a
way-out sense, power structures are often set up by *acknowledgement* of the
gestures (Genet or Kafka, anyone?  Miller's Crossing? etc.) of power.  How
can we begin to ignore the power structures of government?  How can we
ignore their gestures, all the while their powers are PAINFULLY clear?  This
I have no answer for.

Patrick

Sheila Pitt is a printmaker, painter, soft-sculpture and mixed-media artist
who lives and works in Tucson.  She’s a professor in the Art Department of
University of Arizona and has had numerous shows in Tucson and across the
country.  In the 1990s, Pitt created “Women on the Altar,” a series of
experiments in nontraditional printmaking using copper, zinc, fabric, and
glass along with prints and their original woodcuts in a series of related
works that focus on concerns universal to women.  The show was exhibited at
the UA Museum of art in June-July 1994. An example of her more recent cloth
works is “Phallocentric Quilt,” a black and white quilt printed and stitched
with images of her grandparents’ faces in every square, with grandpa
securely in the middle.

Sharon Wahl did graduate work in math at MIT, then completed an MFA in
creative writing at Washington University, in St, Louis.   Her short stories
and poems have appeared in The Iowa Review (Tim McGinnis Award), Chicago
Tribune (Nelson Algren Award finalist), Pleiades (Editors’ Prize in poetry),
Literal Latte (Fiction Contest winner), Harvard Review, and other journals.
She won a fiction fellowship from the Arizona Commission on the Arts in
1999, and is currently teaching at Pima Community College in Tucson.  She is
a member of the POG collective.

        Isn't the ancient (I believe from Horace) definition of poetry's
        function "to delight and instruct"?

Hi Richard, mind if I add my measly one cent?  I like most of what you said
in your post (which is quite a bit longer than what I have reproduced here),
but I do think you overstate just a tad.  I guess some "traditionalists" fear
poetry, but that is pretty much confined to countries in which a poem can
stir the political tides.  In the USA we're generally dealing with tastes.
And they change all the time.  The reality based poem may seem shop worn, but
let's not forget Frank O'Hara's "I do this, I do that" poems which were
astonishingly innovative for the time.  No radical formal machinations
there--just a new attitude toward content.  And no one ever accused Frank of
being dour and timid.  No, that dour and timid thing sounds too much like a
stereotype.  In fact, it could be argued that langpo is the more timid form
since it represses direct emotional expression.  Could it be that the current
ensconced innovators "fear" emotion?  Are they in fact producing the latest
versions of a very long tradition of puritan art?  Of course there are
arguments on both sides, and no doubt they all are worth hearing.

Of the two dominant "avant garde" styles, langpo and vispo, the former is
clearly the more innovative.  When it appeared on the scene, there was a
palpable sense that something new was going on, despite the obvious and
profound influence of Ashbery.  Vispo has been around for centuries, and
remains a hybrid form that fails to appeal to many of those whose primary
love is for language--just not enough of it in vispo, generally.  By the way,
I enjoy, and support, much of both langpo and vispo.  Innovation is
important, but it is not the be all and end all.  There are some vispoems I
consider more successful than some langpoems, and which is more innovative
becomes secondary to which is better art.  We all know that today's
innovation is tomorrow's tradition.  A true traditionalist is the best thing
we have, for as Eliot (that bastard) knew, only the truly experimental get to
join the tradition which is nothing else but a record of innovation, as any
Norton Anthology clearly demonstrates.

One problem for me is that there has been so much innovation since the
sixties that nothing looks very new, anyway.  A return to direct albeit
creatively crafted emotion may be the most innovative thing to approach right
now.  Perhaps not.  But we can all count on one thing.  As langpo enters the
tradition, joins the academy (which any poetry must do in order to
survive--like it or not, that's da fac, Jack), there will be strong reaction
and opposition from the young.

A final note.  I still don't get these attacks on Professors and
Universities.  A poet who has the opportunity to affect students, to share
his obsession with language with the young (some of whom are actually eager
to learn)--a sell out?  When we consider that so many young people have
developed a love for poetry in such places (both "straight from the heart"
stuff and experimental), the attacks often seem little more than straw man
tactics and sour grapes.  Your point that Professors are like guardians rings
true for me.  And we need that.  We all must earn our way.  As we all know,
many never live to see the celebration their work ultimately achieves.  Some
Professors/Critics, it is true, are quite narrow minded.  But anyone who
suggests that the avant garde has historically been open minded needs to get
off the booze.  Same sins in both camps, and both covet power in sometimes
very ugly ways.  Long ago I threw my hat in the progressive ring, but I damn
well know that some of those "traditional" poems are a lot better than some
of the experiments I have seen.  I try to maintain a democratic palate.  In
my view, to shut out anything is to deny one's self an opportunity to be
influenced, to find new combinations, to progress.

No doubt I've overreached your comments.  But I appreciate the opportunity to
sound off on a number of issues.  Best, Bill

>Dear Yunte. I'm not taylor, but I am a Taylor. But I'm in agreement with you in principle. I'm kind of "on the outside looking in" ("reverse' of "outside looking out...") I'm on a very ( or relatively) low income compared to most academics (here referring to those employed at universities) but nor do I "fit in" quite with theso-called "working class". I urge younger "would be poets" to take an interest in what academics are saying without putting them on a pedestal.And even to enrol in courses at our local university (Auckland,N.Z.) The anti-intellectual anti-academic stance is prevalant still. I urge young friends to use the universities and their resources and to look at writers who are "challenging" as well as others such as Bukowski. I see the ideal reader as being able to "take in" Bukowski and Stein, AS WELL AS B's near namesake Zukowski. Bukowski's good but his stance against (if it is against) established or "difficult" poets smacks of envy. Conversely, I dont find r
 eading Stein or Zukovsky "difficult",altho maybe I use some "interpretation" for Z. Reading these poets is like entering into different "contracts" as to how you are going to read. The struggle for progress in art,lit,or politics is constant and is as problematic inside or outside the universities, inside or outside the communist (or any other political) party. There may be a tendency to "get out of touch" with "ordinary people" but these latter can be equally be lacking in healthy contact with academics. Nor can a writer or artist operate effectively if he/she is constantly "at war". We all need times when we "drop out". Similarly society needs its intellectuals (as long as they dont become too stuffy or inflexible, which is a danger whoever you are.)I suspect that Lehman etal are simplifying these issues which old but ongoing and still of vital importance.Regards, Richard Taylor.

I don't know if the LINGUA FRANCA article is available on-line -- the print
version doesn't seem to carry any ref. to a web version -- BUT Andrew
Epstein is on this list & might be willing to make it available to you
directly????   It would not be possible to post it to the list as it's

Alan. I like this one. I often get a "fright" (almost literally when I read
some of the strange language and commands that
my(imperious?imperial?fascist?) computer keeps firing at me when I drift

To quote an American president, let me say this about that.  I can't for
the life of me understand how the question "do we know this guy" sounds
like xenophobia -- wouldn't that be more along the lines of "we don't want
to know this guy"?

but yes, I was trying to be ironic, as Andrew's name was quite visible on
the list of those who compose the "we" to whom I addressed myself -- I'm
always trying --

The one new bit of information I've gleaned regarding this article is that
Andrew was asked to do this piece.  I'd be curious to know how such asking
comes about. -- more curious to know how the request read --

Hi --

A number of people have asked about my article that is being discussed in
this thread and where it can be found.  The article is called "Verse vs.
Verse," and it appears in the current (September) issue of the magazine
Lingua Franca.  LF can be found at a lot of newstands, magazine stores, and
Barnes and Noble type bookstores (at least in NYC, where I am -- it may be a
bit more scarce elsewhere), as well as at college, and I suppose some
public, libraries.  Unfortunately, the editors decided to not offer this
particular article on their website, which is www.linguafranca.com-- at
least not yet.

If there are people interested, I'd be happy to send a xerox of the piece to
the first 15 or so people who backchannel me with their address (please send
messages to me, not the list).  After that, it may get a bit taxing for me,
so please do try to find it in another way if you can.  And thanks for the
interest in the piece.

take care,
Andrew

P. S.  Just a quick response to Yunte Huang:  when I quote a comment by
someone whose point of view you don't like, it doesn't mean that I think
that way or that I "complicitly endorse" (interesting phrase!) that point of
view.  And why am I guilty of endorsing the Lehman comment about the
avant-garde and the academy but not the Hejinian quote about the avant-garde
and the academy you approvingly refer to just an instant before?  This seems
like curious and selective reasoning (and reading) to me....

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
WHAT:  Fall 2000 Issue Launch

WHERE:  Anza Club, #3 West 8th Avenue
INFO:  984-1712

John Newlove comes to Vancouver for fall launch of The Capilano Review

North Vancouver literary and visual arts journal, The Capilano Review is

several readings, including John Newlove

JOHN NEWLOVE was born and raised in Saskatchewan. It was in Vancouver,
where he lived, with interruptions
from 1960-67, that he first began a serious attempt to teach himself to
write verse, impelled by the  company and
conversation of the likes of Roy Kiyooka, Curt Lang and Fred Douglas,
and by the sheer spirit of the city itself.
John has published nearly 20 books. Lies was given a Governor General's
Award; his selected poems, Apology for
Absence, is published by The Porcupine's Quill. In 1999 rob mclennan
published a small chapbook of Newlove's,
The Tasmanian Devil and other poems. Please see
www.library.utoronto.ca/canpoetry/newlove for more
information.

Also reading will be Thea Bowering, Anne Stone, Clint Burnham, and bill
bissett. Admission is $5 (free for
Capilano Press Society members) and includes a copy of the issue.

THEA BOWERING's personal essay The Monster, or The Deferred Subject was
published in TCR 2:31, Spring
2000. She currently works as a freelance writer in Vancouver and is
writing a series of short stories set in
Scandinavia and Canada.

CLINT BURNHAM lives in Vancouver, where he teaches at ECIAD
(postmodernism, cultural theory, Marxism)
and runs a liberal arts program for people on the Downtown Eastside. His
books include The Jamesonian
Unconscious (criticism, Duke, 1995), Steve McCaffery (criticism, ECW,
1996), Be Labour Reading (poetry, ECW,
1997), Airborne Photo (fiction, Anvil, 1999), and, forthcoming, A4isms
(aphorisms, House) and Buddyland
(poetry, Coach House). Work has appeared recently or is about to appear
in Sulfur, Queen Street Quarterly, W,
West Coast Line, and Matrix.

ANNE STONE is author of the novels jacks: a gothic gospel and Hush
(Insomniac Press, 1999), as well as the
chapbook, Sweet Dick All. She currently teaches at Capilano College.

BILL BISSETT is a painter, poet, and performance artist who lives in
Vancouver and Toronto and is the author of
over 70 books of poetry. His work has been produced on cassette and CD
and new sound poetry on CD is
forthcoming from Red Deer Press. Recent titles of his poetry books
include b leev abul char ak trs, scars on th
seehors, th influenza uv logik, inkorrect thots, and northern brids in
color. He recently resurrected his small
magazine blewointment to be included in the upcoming Small Magazines
anthology by The Capilano Review
(edited by Jason Le Heup), a two volume set to be released in Winter and
Spring of 2001.

Jakobson is, believe it or not, fairly straightforward on this. His
alignment of metaphor with an axis of substitution and metonym with an axis
of combination, though probably arguable (he says as much himself on several
occasions), is a good place to start. Unfortunately, I'm blanking on the
title of the article, but I know it's in that Harvard collection "Language
in Literature." The whole essay might be a bit much for an undergraduate
class, but the paragraph or two I have in mind might do well to frame a
discussion.

Best,
Taylor

In my capacity as editor at City Lights, I brought out Paul
Hammond's original study, CONSTELLATIONS OF MIRO, BRETON, in July.
(The volume also contains translations of Breton's poems and
reproductions of Miro's paintings in the Constellations series.)

Paul Hammond's second book for City Lights, THE SHADOW AND ITS
SHADOW: SURREALIST WRITINGS ON THE CINEMA, is shipping now,
ahead of its announced November publication date.

You should be able to find it soon in the usual/unusual places. It
can also be ordered directly from City Lights.

Requests for review or desk copies should be sent to the
City Lights publicist, Stacey Lewis, at stacey@citylights.com.

Thanks,

The Shadow and Its Shadow is a collection of classic writings by the
Surrealists on their mad love of moviegoing. These theoretical, =

polemical, and poetical re-visions of the seventh art document =

Surrealism's scandalous and nonreductive take on film. The essayists
include such names as Breton, Aragon, Desnos, Dal=ED, Bu=F1uel, and Man
Ray as well as many of the less famous though equally fascinating
figures of the movement.

In his introduction, Paul Hammond limns the history of Surrealist
cinemania, highlighting how these revolutionary poets, artists, and
philosophers sifted the silt of commercial--often Hollywood--cinema
for the odd fleck of gold, the windfall movie that, somehow slipping
past the censor, questioned the dominant order. Such prospecting
pivoted around the notion of lyrical behavior--as depicted on the
screen, and as lived in the movie house. The representation of such
behavior led the Surrealists to valorize the manifest content of
such denigrated genres as silent and sound comedy, romantic
melodrama, film noir, horror movies.

As to lived experience, moviegoing Surrealists looked to the
spectacle's latent meaning, reading films as the unwitting providers
of redemptive sequences that could be mentally clipped out of their
narrative context and inserted into daily life--there, to provoke
new adventures.

"Hammond's book is a reminder of the wealth and range of surrealist
writings on the cinema. . . . [T]he work represented here is still
challenging and genuinely eccentric, locating itself in an 'ethic'
of love, reverie and revolt." --Sight & Sound

Paul Hammond is the author of, among other works, Constellations
of Mir=F3, Breton (City Lights Books), L'=C2ge d'or, and Marvellous
M=E9li=E8s. He is the coeditor, with Ian Breakwell, of Seeing in the

i've noticed that lingua franca's pieces often present themselves in terms
of idiotic binaries --about a year ago, there was a piece on "intellectual
rigor v. good writing" or some such nonsense that pitted adorno (rigor)
against orwell (good writing).  this may just be part of their journalistic
packaging --the subtlety, if it exists at all, has to be extrapolated from
the hyped up and oversold "drama" of opposition.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994.
A `round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery by Brad
Brace. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
stellar, trajective alignment past the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative
metaphors for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of events...

A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual
impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless
present of the Net.

An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and
re-sequenced over time... ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The
12hr dialtone...

                  [ see  ftp.idiom.com/users/bbrace/netcom/books ]

KEYWORDS: >> Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous,
reckless... >> Multi-faceted, oblique, obsessive, obscure, obdurate...
>> Promulgated, personal, permeable, prolonged, polymorphous,
provocative, poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic,
pathological... >> Evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,
entertaining, entropic, erotic, entrancing, enduring...

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest
on December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs  has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years`
worth of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the
ongoing publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each
12-hour posting is like the turning of a page; providing ample time
for reflection, interruption, and assimilation.

~ The sites listed above also contain information on other
transcultural projects and sources.

~ A very low-volume, moderated mailing list for announcements and
occasional commentary related to this project has been established at

This project has not received government art-subsidies. Some
opportunities still exist for financially assisting the publication of
editions of large (36x48") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet
quadtones bound as an oversize book. Other supporters receive rare
copies of the first three web-offset printed ISBN-Books.

Thanks for posting this Mark. IMHO Gestalten is one of the
liveliest magazines for experimental & visual poetries around
and the editor Paul Silvia couldn't be a nice more open minded
person. It comes printed on newsprint type paper in both black
& blue inks. Highly recommended.

I was at an SF Planning Commission meeting yesterday afternoon when a
sheriff's deputy grabbed a young man, nearly jerked his arm out of its
socket, and threw him to the ground in the most brutal manner possible. It
seemed he would go right on to hog-tying the man if several of us hadn't
jumped up to protest this treatment. His crime? Going about five seconds
over his allotted timeslot in speaking out against the planning commission's
continuing approval -- without review or study -- of live-work lofts and
new, illegal, non-tax-paying office spaces that are driving out minorities,
longtime residents, artists, and musicians in droves from the city of San
Francisco.

How is this connected to the now long-distant (geographically and
polemically) protest against the treatment of Bei Ling? Maybe it's not...
but a friend and writer once told me that "It's important to be a witness,"
and inherent, I think, in the concept of "witness" is "one who testifies to
what he saw." What the government -- any government, whether it's
represented by state troopers in Florida, secret police in China, or
sheriff's deputies in supposedly liberal San Francisco -- never seems to
realize is that with every blow on the head of a nonviolent protestor, every
denial of basic civil liberties, it's radicalizing a new segment of the
population, i.e. all those who were there to witness it in some way,
assuming they have a sense to get outraged with.

While I too would much rather keep the focus on poetry rather than politics,
sometimes the latter seems intent on intruding, clumsy, brutal, and
thoughtless as always, and something needs to be said, even in a forum meant
for poetics.

Short of getting into an ever-widening spiral of ad hominems regarding
purported "delusions," I can only return to my point, conveniently passed
over by you, that the states under discussion are instruments of domination.
That's neither the politics of a Gore-touting erstwhile reformer, nor of a
cheerleader for the Texas serial killer and dynastic scion. Nor, really, of
an optimistic social-democratic Naderite.

To your question:

Why do you attack Republican philosophy and blame that party for acts you
call tyrannical by the Federal Government and its police?

I'll keep my answer within the narrow bounds of personal experience: someone
gassed and beaten in vitro by Nixon's hired goons, who grew up to receive
his first identifying scar at the hands of one of (Republican) Bob Martinez'
Florida state troopers during a nonviolent civil action, might be somewhat
justified in placing a certain amount of blame in that direction. But no
fear, it's an equal opportunity attack: Lawton Chiles' state troopers kicked
my ass too. And Clinton and Gore have been as instrumental as Reagan in
busting up the social movements (and the civil society) that gave those I
care for a measure of hope. In my neck of the woods, we talk about Clinton's
presidency as years 13-20 of the Reagan/Bush administration.

But this has become really tiresome, especially as it's taken shape in my
attempt to produce a rebuttal to what was simply your placing of words in my
mouth. (Read my initial post: I never mentioned Republicanism as the locus
of the problems I was identifying, nor did I make any mention of voting for
Gore). Reluctant as I am to join those who can be counted on to groan at
every mention of politics on the list, I'm going to absent myself from
further discussion of this until your posts come up to argument from their
current level of blank assertion (with emphatic caps, no less - nice touch).

Pray tell me.  Why, then, if you vote, you will likely vote Gore?  Why do
you attack Republican philosophy and blame that party for acts you call
tyrannical by the Federal Government and its police?

The reason you will vote Gore/Clinton is that you believe in a set of what I
call Liberal political visions that will lead inevitably to their EXACT
OPPOSITE.  For instance, ALL of the WOMEN who stood up to the Big HEE or
A.A. Gore are now being AUDITED by the IRS! But of course this inconvenient
fact is never going to be acknowledged by the preponderant majority of
writers on this line and the line's administration. As a RadLib feminist
poet in Boulder said, "I want women to have power in government, not Jean
Kirkpatrick."  Who on this line even remembers Jean Kirkpatrick?

In other words, regardless of your NICE words, ostensibly reasonable, your
vision will lead to even MORE government in the US of the sort you say you
deplore. WHY?  Because it is the type of intellectual who dominates this
Line that runs China today!  The peasants who now REVOLT against Zemin
revolt against an intellectual class of people who think like MANY on this
LINE!

If you took the time to really understand Republicanism, you could make it
work to attain the justices you seek.  More poets should adopt Republicanism
as their vehicle for the kind of freedom they supposedly embody.  I say:
To hell with Ernesto Cardinale and the poetry of Mao Zedung.  Forget it.
State run poetry is an oxymoron!  Get back into the more sophisticated and
grounded views of Frost.

Nearly all of the talk I see on this line attempts to reform the evermore
tyrannical Federal administration of the country by even MORE of it, simply
replacing the hand of one deluded Liberal generation with another, one
radical clique that seized control of the Democrat party in one time with
the children from the next.  A ridiculous equation.

Hello RL,

The classic account of the metaphor/metonymy distinction is Jakobson's, as
I'm sure you know.  See the essays collected in *Language in Literature* [a
paperback edit. published bu Harvard Univ. Press], where it is discussed
frequently [esp. 109-114].  I have used this book with undergraduates.
There's a lot in it that is difficult for them, but the metaphor/metonymy
thing iis not especially hard, and J's examples in the pages mentioned seem
to work well.

If this seems too hard, Terence Hawkes summarizes Jakobson's take in
*Structuralism and Semiotcis* [pp.76-79], a useful little book that
undergraduates will be able to handle.

Best,

George Thompson

SUB/CON/TEXT CDROM 2.03 Available:

COLLECTED WORK, 1994-2000

Alan Sondheim


I've been working non-stop on putting as much of my work (dealing with
literature, psychology, cyberspace, language, sexuality, body, etc.) on
one cdrom. The result is sub/con/text (which also includes collabora-
tions with Foofwa d'Imobilite, Barry Smyle, and Azure Carter), which is
available now. sub/con/text is an enormous mass of material - some of
which is available on my website, but most of which will be new to you.

The advantage of the cdrom, in any case, is that you can explore it at
your leisure, copy out texts and graphics, etc. It's relatively easy to
use - you can access the various directories through a browser or any
file browser such as Explorer. The cdrom was made on a PC, but because it
is only files and directories, I imagine it will open on most Macs as
well.


Includes:

30 articles, outlines of 8 talks, 345 images (approx.), 6 music tracks
(mp3), the full Internet Text (approximately 3800 pages) and additional
materials (revised The Case of the Real; Ma, a Novel), 7-8 webpage
suites (including Water, Frac, Narcissistic Disturbance, etc.); approx-
imately 15 video segments in .avi format and one also in .rm and .asf
formats; and 61 tiny programs on basic, perl, or dialog.

The sound should be playable on most mp3-compatible players; the video
will open in various players as well. The texts are accessible through
most browsers at cdrom\network\index.html . The websuites will open in
almost any browser as well. The texts and articles are all in text-based
ascii format, which means they're readable literally with anything;
they're the core of the cdrom. There is a readme_1st.txt which acts as a
guide.

There is 'adult' material on the cdrom; please keep away from children.

I'm asking $10 + $4 shipping and handling; this helps cover the costs of
the burner, label, case, disk, and most important, the labor. Please send
$14.00 in check, cash, or money order, with a return address, to

The September issue of ABdotWW (formerly A Brief Description of the Whole
World) comprises responses to the poetry and prose writing of Alan Loney.

No doubt a number of you already know of Alan's writing: he's been a key
practitioner in New Zealand new poetry for some thirty years now and just
recently has been producing some terrific new works.

Anyone interested in this issue, or in a subscription to ABdotWW ($US25
p.a. post-free, quarterly issues), can email me or make contact via: The
Writers Group, 11-20 Poynton Tce., Auckland 1001, NZ.

+

The Writers Group is to publish a selection of Alan's critical writing,
probably in the new year, the first of what is intended to be a series of
publications of new writing. Should you have an interest in such
publications, please be in touch.

Selected PoemsA short but quite positive review of one of our very finest

September 10, 2000

By MELANIE REHAK

''We know where love is by its stillness,'' Fanny Howe writes in one of the
spare, muscled poems gathered in ''Selected Poems,'' work culled from 20
years of her poetry. Indeed, it's stillness more than anything else that
tempers this volume; its quiet, forceful poems carry an existential weight
that belies their small size. Among other things, Howe has made a long-term
project of trying to determine how we fit into God's world, and her aim is
both true and marvelously free of sentimental piety. ''Mad God, mad thought
/ Take me for a walk,'' she writes, ''Stalk me. Made God, / Wake me with
your words. / Believe in what I said.'' Her work is fueled by a persistent
need to find out not the meaning of life itself, but how to ask what it is.
''A feeling triggers a feeling, then the heft / Of the hand to work,'' Howe
states in a typically Dickinsonian moment. It's as if she can't help herself
Ñ these fierce poems demand to be put forth. Taken together, they create a
world of their own, a series of structures that dot the landscape Howe
travels. ''My vagabondage / is unlonelied by poems'' she confesses at one
point, as if to justify her questioning. She's on a private quest through
the metaphysical universe, and the results are startling and honest. ''If
goals create content stealth creates form,'' she writes. Her ''Selected
Poems'' proves she's absolutely correct.

Here we go again.

And Gore isn't a dynastic scion?

And Tennessee doesn't have a death penalty?

And the Clintons didn't send a retard to his execution who thought he was
going to be able to come back to his plate of cherry pie after a momentary
adjournment?

Serial killer?  A creepy remark.  Creepy.  And cheap.

I wasn't talking political parties, I was talking PHILOSOPHY.  I want more
poets to make Republicanism work for the ends they seek:  freedom for the
individual.  I didn't say that all poets could adopt Republicanism, either.

For instance, I want poets of the future to have the independence A.A. Gore
has by owning a million dollars worth of Occidental Petroleum stock.
Dubya's 2% monthly investment in their Social Security accounts will help
them get there.

Hi All,

The semester and my Description class has begun.  The class has met
twice and looks like it's going to be a good group--16 people who
seem open and eager to talk.  Again, this is a "fiction" craft class
for MFAs.  The bulk of the writing assignments will be creative
exercises rather than essays.

I'd like to thank everybody on the list for their amazingly helpful
suggestions.  I couldn't use everything, with this embarrassment of
riches, but even when I didn't use reading suggestions, your
suggestions helped to focus, refine and broaden my thinking on the
topic.  Please forgive me for not thanking each of you individually.
I can only offer the usual excuse: drowning in things to get done.

Dear Friends of the Goethe-Institut,

Last week you received an e-mail from us concerning our current calendar of
events.  As you undoubtedly noticed, it wasn’t sent as a ‘blind copy’, and
the list of addressees weren’t hidden.  We understand the severity of this
problem and apologize for the error.  We’ve also taken measures to assure it
won’t happen again!

Thanks for your interest in the Goethe-Institut, and enjoy the upcoming
events!

I have no idea at whom this was directed, but I share your concern.  Yes, the
puritans are among us, and in force.  As Freud knew, those who are most
disgusted usually harbor a strong  desire for what offends them, and some
major guilt to go along with it.  A little "insanity" might be just what the
doctor ordered.  Might put a little feeling back into the asylum.  "Morality
is a weakness of the brain."   Rimbaud, of course, was referring to those
socially proscribed practices, aesthetic, sexual or otherwise.  But hell,
what aesthetic isn't socially proscribed these days?  We have our work cut
out for us.  Best, Bill

Just to back Taylor up--the *names* we have for our emotions don't even begin
to  match the variety of its "flavors".

Pleasure X, say--unlike language--is something *more* than the absence of
pleasures Y and Z.  Pleasure is a positivity.

Beauty & disgust are united by the quality of *wonder*--the 100,000 (or so)
different reasons we have for saying WOW!

Don't forget that the full title of the journal where Andrew Epstein
published his article ("Verse vs. Verse") is: *Lingua franca: THE
REVIEW OF ACADEMIC LIFE*.

I mean: what else needs be said *about the article*?

It cost $6.25, plus taxes.

His essay's title, "Verse vs. Verse," contains a rich irony the author
does not pursue, and that ironically sums-up what is at stake for any
reader of this journal, concerning whether or not Language poets are
avant-garde or not.

I mean, what-else needs saying about all this?

Ok, perhaps a comment, seventy years after Joyce, on the advertising
scattered throughout the pages of the article:

The essay's title alone takes a full page, and opposite it, a full-page ad
from Barnes & Noble for eight volumes of short stories with titles
including *A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You*, *Close Range* and
*Dream Stuff*. In the article itself, there is an ad for
"HarperSanFrancisco: A Division of HarperCollinsPublishers"'s *A Long Way
From Tipperary: What A Former Irish Monk Discovered in his Search for the
Truth*, and opposite that mirrored as half-page an ad from Blackwell
subliminally titled "Broaden Your Literary Horizons...", then, in the next
set of pages, ads from Duke and Praeger, and two ads for postdocs in many
subjects except poetry's (but, what *is* its subject?), plus an ad for The
Treatment Center of The New York Psychoanalytic Institute, and, lastly,
announcement of a new translation of the Italian Ren. poet Tasso's
*Gerusalemme liberata* (rock on, translation-dude!). But the transcendent
peak of all this close-range dream-stuff, however, is another full-page ad
on exiting the article, titled: "Palgrave: Global Publishing at St.
Martin's Press." "Palgrave," the ad will inform you, is St. Martin's new
imprint -- "combines the Scholarly and Reference Division with Macmillan
Press (UK)." Of course, the vaulted snowy peak of the name "Palgrave" is
that it was the monicker for the most popular anthology of
English-language verse for Victorian hearths, right into Pound's time,
and, no doubt, right into ours, the name will last on, a seamless relay
for any blind man to see.

Two things worthy of note here in the pages of Andrew's article: it's
"HarperSanFrancisco," i.e. no spaces between the words!! -- but why? what
are the implications?; and, apparently the NY Psych. Inst. has a sliding
fee-scale!! (is it only for academics?? and does it "slide" in the first
place because the pharmaceuticals industry is now taking larger and larger
bites out of their pie??).

Andrew, fun article. I like the (but, unattributed) photowit of having
Bernstein and Andrews ascending from the Underground (subway). How come
Bruce looks disoriented?

Did you consider writing an essay about this subject for a poetry
magazine/newsletter instead? The entire address, virtually all
the content, presentational vim, journalistic stylease, would have had to
have been radically altered -- don't you think?...but I think it's an
interesting thought-experiment

all best,
louis

Hi List, Merry Fortune asked me to post the following query:

Hi,

I am interested in talking with mainly multicultural poetry or writing
collectives for an article on collectives! Some of the aspects of collective
life I would like to look at are:

The emotional lives/business practices and ethics of your collective.

The idea that collectives are a way of peacefully and quietly deflecting the
somewhat corporate techno-mentality and intrusion of aspiring paces and
cultivating an an "old world" sense of intimacy.=20

And revealing the essence of something that goes well and works and to
reveal the uniqueness and similarities of each collective.

You get pleasure from the stimulus that outweighs the disgust it
causes you to feel; that doesn't make the disgust you experience
pleasure.  Note the "only" in what I say, "An artwork that elicits only
disgust cannot be pleasurable (or desired by anyone sane)."

Again, nothing insane about getting pleasure from something other
people get only disgust from--but it is, I still say, insane to
want that which cause you to feel only pain, in whatever form.  If
not impossible.

As for social consequences, there's a plus and minus to everything:
identifying insane practices can be used against non-conformists but
can also (theoretically) locate genuine problems and help people
overcome them.

The all sound interesting--but seem not to be about a desire for the
painful; instead they seem to be about the pleasure of the partially
painful.  There's also, of course, the pleasure of defeating pain, and
the putting up with pain in the belief that it will lead to pleasure
(as in training for a sporting event).

I disagree, Bill.  The danger to mediocrities of poetry of a kind
they're not used to (whether innovative or simply outside their
constricted experience the way visual poetry is outside the experience
of many language poets, and--to be fair--language poetry is outside the
experience of many visual poets) is that it threatens their intellectual
self-esteem, because they can't understand it.  So they pretend it
doesn't exist until they're forced to acknowledge it, whereupon they
deny its innovativeness and/or decry its willful incoherence.

Maybe he wasn't socially, but to shrink from higher meanings (which
O'Hara didn't always do) is certainly a form of timidity--as is
shrinking from anything (including the banal, the informally-
expressed)--as you go on to imply.

Do you really believe poets trying for verbal innovation in their poetry
are likely to be more innovative than poets trying for visual innovation
AND verbal innovation (as all the best visual poets do)?

I don't know about "profound" there, but I do know that Olson, Stein,
Cummings, Pound, Eliot--Roethke, even--the Dadaists and others
influenced language poetry a lot more than Ashbery.

>  Vispo has been around for centuries,

Serious, non-decorative visual poetry has been around for less than
a century.  Yes, to me Herbert's shaped poems' visuality was decorative
only.  That's why the academy is willing to applaud Hollander's
imitations of them.

Not enough of visual interest in langpo, either.  Dunno what you're
arguing here.  We all know that some people are too narrow to appreciate
one or more arts.

There are exceptions, of course, but in general it takes a different
kind of person to plug away in a certified career lane as one who
becomes a professor must from the kind who CAN'T (for better or worse)
stick to such a lane.  And the former will tend to prefer knownstream
to otherstream art, because that's what lines his lane.  The big
problem, though, is that professors wield far more short-term cultural
power than independent artists, and they much more often than not
use it against the best independent artists (however they try to hide
that with token gestures towards the marginal--as when Marjorie Perloff
granted visual poetry a seminar at Stanford that mentioned two or three
genuine visual poets a while back).

You're right, Maria, the Adorno/Orwell standoff was really bizarre,
but fun, kind of like a mental roller coaster ride.  I love Lingua
Franca, myself, see as a kind of National Enquirer for academics.
Years ago, when I'd never heard of the mag, Kevin and I were crashing
at Albert Mobilio's studio in NYC, and Albert was still writing for
LF at the time, so copies were lying around.  KK and I read the issue
about the sexual harassment charges against Jane Gallup, and we
signed up for a subscription when we got home.  I still sometimes
think about how taking one's shoe off while sitting in a chair could
be seen as a sign of sexual aggression.

Or I was talking recently to someone from the English Department at
Stonybrook, and I'm like, "Your department's been through a lot
lately!"  Having read all about it in--where else--Lingua Franca!

But if I were doing serious academic writing--or expecting that--I'd
be burning issues myself.

Taylor is right. This article gets a bit thick as it goes on but is a
great place to wade in to.

Jakobson, Roman. "Concluding Statement: Linguistics and Poetics", Style in
language, edited by Thomas A. Sebeok.
                    [Cambridge] Technology Press of Massachusetts
Institute of Technology [1960]. 350- 377)


I've been walking around with this essay for some time now and it is
unfortunate that, 40 years later, his conclusion still holds true.

"If there are some critics that believe who still doubt the competence of
linguistics to embrace the field of poetics, I privately believe that the
poetic competence of some bigoted linguists has been mistaken for the an
inadequacy of the linguistic science itself. All of us here, however,
definitely realize that a linguist deaf to the poetic function of language
and a literary scholar indifferent to linguistic problems and unconversant
in linguistic methods are equally flagrant anachronisms."  (Jakobson 377)

this is an unpaid political announcement. if you're on a list to which Alan
Sondheim contributes, you've seen the quantity of work that he produces. the
quality and variety are impressive. his work is strange, intense, beguiling,
beautiful and surprising. myself, I'm taken with the humour that arises in
Alan's work. his humour, to me, is the sanity that holds his work together,
but that's just my take. the point is that it is worthy work, if judged by
no other basis than his commitment. we've all seen his work for free. 14
bucks for a shitload of material aint a bad deal. that's near what books
cost. in the grander sense, buying Alan's cd-rom is a support of Poetry
itself, just as buying any mag or book is. lest we forget, poetry is fucking
marginal. this is a world of 200 copy press runs. sheesh. some of you out
there maybe teach poetry, or elsewise turn a profit, but for all of us, if
poetry has any meaning at all, it is worth a few ducats. even, really, if
you don't like Alan's work. this is not a mattter of marketing. it's a
community thing. at the very least, one can think in terms of a potlatch
economy. buying Alan's cd-rom won't even affect the down payment on that SUV
you're looking at. end of sermon. Allen Bramhall

Maria -

Opposition is but one species of building tension.  any division creates
tension it seems. All divisions make things digestible.  It's why we have
teeth, right?  some people prefer division systems with n>2 where n equals
the number of parts.  i see the value of n as wholly outside of moral
judgment, whether n is 2 or 100.   So I don't criticize people for being
binary, as tempted as I may be to do so.

and what is writing without tension?  perhaps this is *not* a rhetorical
question, for if there's one thing I know, it is that I don't know much.

so lingua franca is simple, OK.  there's nothing wrong with that, I think.
what I sense in your note here is that there was perhaps something in the
adorno/orwell article that you disliked that went beyond the structure of
the article.  I am more ready to buy that then to buy that it is merely the
structure that makes the argument or the magazine invalid or with little
value.

my simple difficulty with epstein's article is that i am not interested in
the issue of 'selling out' for there may be nothing pure in this world,
especially in America where capital reigns supreme.  epstein's discussion
starts with a binary and modulates beyond a binary after the introduction to
a collection of about 8 or 9 different loci.  epstein's article doesn't
retain a binary though it starts with one.  i think his discussion becomes
somewhat complex and open actually, and to epstein's credit.  but i could
care less ultimately whether he shows two teams or 2 million individuals.

here's the essence of my criticism: the issues of 'selling out' and
'contradiction', however, which i see as essential to the article, seem to
lack a flavor of compassion for human desire and identity. (let me make it
clear that I am NOT saying either that the article or the author lack a
flavor of compassion for human desire and identity.)

on the flip side of my critique, the discussion of what some people within
academia do to keep it from being so corporatized or so
institutional/power-that-is DOES interest me, and epstein surely does touch
upon that.  my dislike was merely with the set-up and the partial focus on
the notion that people like silliman and bernstein have betrayed their youth
and that there was some dwelling on selling out and apparent contradictions.

Subject: Re: assimilation vs. purity


i've noticed that lingua franca's pieces often present themselves in terms
of idiotic binaries --about a year ago, there was a piece on "intellectual
rigor v. good writing" or some such nonsense that pitted adorno (rigor)
against orwell (good writing).  this may just be part of their journalistic
packaging --the subtlety, if it exists at all, has to be extrapolated from
the hyped up and oversold "drama" of opposition.

Again, you seem to be mistaking my criticism of Bush for a defense of Gore,
who will get nothing of the sort from me. Since my requests that you
actually read my posts before mulching them with your conspiracy
manure-spreader has gone unheeded now twice, I'll consider my end of this
dubious "debate" concluded. I leave it to others to decide which is
"creepier": my characterization of Bush as a serial killer, or his own race
toward a national record for most death warrants signed, and greatest racial
disproportion in the carrying out of those warrants.

Here we go again.

And Gore isn't a dynastic scion?

And Tennessee doesn't have a death penalty?

And the Clintons didn't send a retard to his execution who thought he was
going to be able to come back to his plate of cherry pie after a momentary
adjournment?

Serial killer?  A creepy remark.  Creepy.  And cheap.

I wasn't talking political parties, I was talking PHILOSOPHY.  I want more
poets to make Republicanism work for the ends they seek:  freedom for the
individual.  I didn't say that all poets could adopt Republicanism, either.

For instance, I want poets of the future to have the independence A.A. Gore
has by owning a million dollars worth of Occidental Petroleum stock.
Dubya's 2% monthly investment in their Social Security accounts will help
them get there.

the names we have for feelings usually don't capture the feeling.  what
is missed can often (and only!)be reached through visual poetry, web
poetry, sound poetry.  The new ELO chat at
http://www.eliterature.org/cgi-bin/dcforum/dcboard.cgi?az=list&forum=DCForumID5&conf=DCConfID1
might be a place to talk about this.

David -

i understand that you and many others associate binaries with war and sports
teams, but that doesn't make the very structure of a binary repulsive or
ignorant in any way.  i am sure you find neither war nor sports nor
corporations valueless because they do things in twos instead of ones or
twenties or whatever other number.  you most likely have more articulate
reasons to dislike the things on your list than a general condemnation of 2.
i dislike all of those things you mention but not because of their twoness.

even the two party-system -- there's nothing wrong with it's two ness though
there is plenty wrong with how they express one view point and how they
exclude others.  but there's nothing immoral or unvirtuous about the number
2.

Not sure about the way your argument slides from "disgust" to "pain" in the
final paragraph. But yeah, I suppose we could say the same things about
pain, in a way. What continues to give me pause is the heroic narrative of
positive human feelings (i.e., pleasure) winning through the adversity of
pain/disgust. Certainly, it's a fairly deep cultural embedding, even to our
sense of "perversion" as a turning aside, a detour - the long way round. As
in, what are all those silly perverts/aesthetes/etc. doing wasting so much
time just getting back around to the wholesome pleasure we normal folks can
access without all the theatrics?

There's another way of staging that drama, though, and it goes something
like this, in my version: One of our primary models for pleasure - orgasm -
occurs to us as a passivation, an undergoing. (All the cultural baggage of
le petit mort, etc., can enter here and stand around on stage looking bored
as the verbiage piles up). That we more or less actively pursue it speaks to
a desire to take up the conditions of our own bodies' passivity, in our own
hands (literally or figuratively). Now this passivation, at the level of
both emotional and physiological response, would seem to be something common
to persons expiring in bliss, puking in disgust, and wincing in pain. In all
three cases, I'd argue it's the question of "taking-up" - thus a context
within which the condition is placed, and a praxis that works on it - rather
than some formulation of converting emotional or sensual negatives into
their opposites, that is decisive in the question "pleasure or no?"

One might frame it in terms of consent, though that would have to be broad
enough to cover a range from consent at the level of the act ("yes, you can
touch me there": the analogy for our present purposes would be the literary
anthology one skips around in, certain characters and practices in which one
makes a point of avoiding) to consent at the level of the scene ("yes, you
can immobilize me and control my body's actions for a while": here the
analogy is the poetry reading, where, past one's initial informed decision,
one's pretty much in it until the end. Both often hold a stock of potential
circuit breakers or safe words in reserve, usually some variant of, "OK,
that's enough." One wishes poetry audiences used them more often.)

So it's not a matter, to my mind (or body), of pleasure "outweighing" or
"defeating" disgust or pain, but of disgust or pain being pleasure under
certain concrete conditions. And this is consistent in the other direction
as well - a stranger fondling my genitals on the bus uninvited occurs to me
as violation, regardless of whether my body responds in the ways typical of
"pleasure."

A final quibble, at the nitpicker's level of logic. When you write:

Again, nothing insane about getting pleasure from something other people get
only disgust from--but it is, I still say, insane to want that which cause
you to feel only pain, in whatever form.

Foregoing that slide I mentioned previously, I wonder simply how you manage
to exclude the class you define after the em dash (those insane people who
want that which causes only pain), from the class defined before (those sane
people who are practicing nonconformists). I don't see how it can be done,
without smuggling into the definition of the word "pleasure" exactly that
appeal to the practices and preferences of "other people" you've just
announced as null. Or, from another angle, I'm not convinced that you've
demonstrated any difference between "getting pleasure from" and "wanting
that which." From either angle, you're allowing me as a sane person full
access to my pleasure, but only so long as I maintain a categorical
distinction between that pleasure and pain, setting the stage for the truly
perverse act in which the pleasure I am allowed to get without
psychiatric/medical intervention to save me from myself, is precisely that
which I do not want.

Still crazy,
Taylor

P.S. I'm aware that my whole argument rests on that phrase "one of our
primary models for pleasure..." I mean that "one," and I don't want to imply
that the model I've sketched above holds true for all pleasure - any more
than the "negative-sensation" model holds true for all pain. I'd like to see
room for what I've argued alongside the more "intentional," less "undergone"
pleasures of the perfectly executed double play or the meticulous
alphabetizing of my library.

You get pleasure from the stimulus that outweighs the disgust it
causes you to feel; that doesn't make the disgust you experience
pleasure.  Note the "only" in what I say, "An artwork that elicits only
disgust cannot be pleasurable (or desired by anyone sane)."

Again, nothing insane about getting pleasure from something other
people get only disgust from--but it is, I still say, insane to
want that which cause you to feel only pain, in whatever form.  If
not impossible.

As for social consequences, there's a plus and minus to everything:
identifying insane practices can be used against non-conformists but
can also (theoretically) locate genuine problems and help people
overcome them.

The all sound interesting--but seem not to be about a desire for the
painful; instead they seem to be about the pleasure of the partially
painful.  There's also, of course, the pleasure of defeating pain, and
the putting up with pain in the belief that it will lead to pleasure
(as in training for a sporting event).

Hi Rachel,

In the unlikely event that you're looking for the terms' traditional

Richard Lanham's A HANDLIST OF RHETORICAL TERMS is useful.

Wasn't William Carlos Williams doing that kind of thing long before
O'Hara?

--------

Austin:  Nope, close but no cigar.  Williams always wrote as if he had
something major to say, competing with Eliot and all that.  No, O'Hara's
particular celebration of urban minutiae  is an original.  And all that
Hollywood stuff.  And his tone!

---------

Maybe he wasn't socially, but to shrink from higher meanings (which
O'Hara didn't always do) is certainly a form of timidity--as is
shrinking from anything (including the banal, the informally-
expressed)--as you go on to imply.

----------

Austin:  Not sure we can easily identify exactly who is shrinking from higher
meanings.  Language has the capacity to resonate in all sorts of ways.  But
when the materiality of the word becomes the focus, the "poetry" tends to be
about that and sometimes little else.  Which is fine by me.  Referential
language (conventional, symbolic, etc.) more often creates rather than limits
dimensions, at least such an argument may be proffered.  It's the difference
between opening a door on a Hollywood backlot (nothing behind it) and opening
a door to a real building (lots of rooms).  Of course there are exceptions,
and the mind inevitably struggles to make meaning and more meaning out of all
art.  And some of Frank's "I do this, I do that" poems resonate like
gangbusters without going for the Modernist or high Modernist major
statement.  On the other hand, if shrinking from "higher meanings" is the
test, then poetry ended with the Modernists, since postmodernism is all about
such shrinking, the fragmentation of the ONE.

Do you really believe poets trying for verbal innovation in their poetry
are likely to be more innovative than poets trying for visual innovation
AND verbal innovation (as all the best visual poets do)?

----------------

Austin:  Keep reading.

I don't know about "profound" there, but I do know that Olson, Stein,
Cummings, Pound, Eliot--Roethke, even--the Dadaists and others
influenced language poetry a lot more than Ashbery.

-----------------------

Austin:  Yes, there are many influences--that's always true.  But it was
Ashbery and the postructuralist philosophers who got the langpo ball moving.
They were more than influences--they were more like a hammer to the
carburetor to start the engine.  When Ashbery's poetry, and Derrida's
philosophy hit land, the floodgates opened.

------------------------

>  Vispo has been around for centuries,

Serious, non-decorative visual poetry has been around for less than
a century.  Yes, to me Herbert's shaped poems' visuality was decorative
only.  That's why the academy is willing to applaud Hollander's
imitations of them.

----------------------

Austin:  You should get in touch with Kuzminsky.  He's got a file of vp from
ancient and Medieval neighborhoods that will knock your socks off.  Merely
decorative?  Not at all.  Some beautiful and brilliant stuff.  Herbert was a
concrete poet, no?  I'm referring to something much closer to what we have
today.  Of course the technology has advanced.  But the procreation of
computers doesn't affect the quality of vp any more than the invention of the
typewriter made for better verses.  But these technologies do permit new
innovations which is not the same thing as quality.

Not enough of visual interest in langpo, either.  Dunno what you're
arguing here.  We all know that some people are too narrow to appreciate
one or more arts.

------------------

Austin:  Of course.  But I was offering an explanation, obliquely, for the
relative successes of langpo and vispo.

But Robert Frost is (properly) there.

----------------------------

Austin:  Yes, and he was one hell of an innovator when it came to the
dark/light of imagery, the potential for an image to fold back on itself,
meaning and unmeaning at the same time.

There are exceptions, of course, but in general it takes a different
kind of person to plug away in a certified career lane as one who
becomes a professor must from the kind who CAN'T (for better or worse)
stick to such a lane.  And the former will tend to prefer knownstream
to otherstream art, because that's what lines his lane.  The big
problem, though, is that professors wield far more short-term cultural
power than independent artists, and they much more often than not
use it against the best independent artists (however they try to hide
that with token gestures towards the marginal--as when Marjorie Perloff
granted visual poetry a seminar at Stanford that mentioned two or three
genuine visual poets a while back).

----------------------------

Austin:  Bob, everyone has to work, or most everyone in the real world.  What
about all those poets who work in the private sector in some capacity,
feeding the corporate machine?  What about their personalities?  They're not
sell outs, but Professors are?  These are stereotypes, plain and simple.
This still sounds like your garden variety conspiracy theory to me (they
wield power against poor us).  There is no backroom agreement to oppress.  As
I said, we're dealing with tastes--and most people who enjoy poetry, in or
out of the academy, prefer work that is less conceptual, more readable.
That's life.  It's a big country out there.  Everyone with a career is
plugging, one hopes.  And yes, certain few professors have power over
cultural directions.  What's wrong with that?  It's their job.  It's what
they were trained for ten years to do.  We can't all hit the big time.  In my
view, they've done a damn good, if not perfect, job.  They are, after all,
largely responsible for the staying power of Stein, cummings, and all those
other guys we like.  And it's never been true that Profs must to stick to the
knownstream.  It's just a better bet.  When a critic goes otherstream for
her/his subject, s/he's taking a risk.  S/he might end up with a hat with two
propellors instead of a 747.  And let's face it, there's plenty left to say
about those poets who are knownstream.  They are really, really, good.  But
mostly Profs, like most other people, stick to what they enjoy.  In this
sense, most people on the planet are timid.  Are we to believe there's some
connection between the kind of personality that can't hold a job and the
ability to produce quality poetry?!  And what's this love of power, anyway?
Who cares how much power independent artists have?  It's supposed to be about
art.  The power is in the art.  If power is so important to us, we should run
for Congress.  Independent artists do have more power relative to the arts
academy than the guy who invents in his garage has vs. the official
scientific community.  So it looks like the arts academy is doing pretty
well.  Let's just do our job (making and sharing art), and let them do
theirs.  Last time I looked over the  Western history of literature, I wasn't
too disappointed.  One terrific writer after another.

Yes, that's the one I had in mind. It's in the Harvard Language in
Literature as simply "Linguistics and Poetics." Thanks, Kevin.

Forgive my forwarding with Patrick's permission.  I'm delighted to be in sync
with anyone as bright as he is:

"A poet who has the opportunity to affect students, to share

his obsession with language with the young (some of whom are actually eager

to learn)--a sell out?  When we consider that so many young people have

developed a love for poetry in such places (both "straight from the heart"

stuff and experimental), the attacks often seem little more than straw man

tactics and sour grapes.  Your point that Professors are like guardians

rings

true for me.  And we need that.  We all must earn our way.  As we all know,

many never live to see the celebration their work ultimately achieves.  Some

Professors/Critics, it is true, are quite narrow minded.  But anyone who

suggests that the avant garde has historically been open minded needs to get

off the booze.  Same sins in both camps, and both covet power in sometimes

very ugly ways.  Long ago I threw my hat in the progressive ring, but I damn

well know that some of those "traditional" poems are a lot better than some

of the experiments I have seen."


I see what you mean by my taking the words out of your mouth; here, you have

taken mine.  Could not say this any better.

Bob, knowing you as one of the most knowledgeable practitioners/critics
engaged in VisPo today, I  was surprised to read yr following statement:

<< Serious, non-decorative visual poetry has been around for less than
a century.  Yes, to me Herbert's shaped poems' visuality was decorative
only.  That's why the academy is willing to applaud Hollander's
imitations of them. >>

Practically every anthology on this subject proves otherwise. A visual aspect
of poetry, far from being a decorative element, was a manifested and
essential component at the cradle of human culture, and together with oral
tradition, religion and written sign constituted ONE inseparable cultural
field. A split between art and literature happened later, in the process of
urbanization. Everywhere we look back in history, we find irrefutable
evidence that tradition of VisPo has always existed.

Here are just a couple of sources (and there is so much more out there):

Visual LitCrit. Precisely: Three Four Five,
ed. by Richard Kostelanetz. West Coast Poetry Review, 1979.
- Most of this volume is dedicated to LitCrit on VisPo before 20th century.

"A Point of View: Visual Poetry in the 90's", ed. by D. Bulanov, Simplisii,
Russia, 1998
- has 2 wonderful articles on a continuous tradition of VisPo by Jeremy Adler
and "Idea of VisPo: Reconstruction of Archive" by Dmitry Bulatov
(unfortunately, both in Russian, but available in English somewhere else, i
am sure).

In short, in the last hundred years, we have witnessed a serious revival of
VisPo, accompanied by movement toward reintegration of art and writing. Let's
not diminish or underestimate VisPo's rich history. Now that we have a firmly
established tradition of avant-garde writing (!), it should be easier to
accept. As for limitations of "avant-garde" as a term specific to the 20
century, don't get me started ;-) ...

Best,
Igor Satanovsky

Bill. I was making a general point about innovation. I made this point to
John Geraets who edits ABDOTWW which came under "attack" from a young friend
of mine Scott Hamilton. I was trying to point out that the main complaint of
Alan Loney had seemed to me (he wrote many editorials which were interesting
but constantly complained of him and the "avant garde" (altho I dont think
he used that term) being relegated to the margins etc) to be that
"oppositional" writing, as he called it, was being rejected, and that the
more conservative or "realist" writers, many of whom are pretty dull in
fact, were still dominating the scene. But Geraets didnt see the point that,
if Loney is a major N.Z. poet (and significant enough or original
enough)(and I like his work very much)to be "disturbing the universe" say in
contradistinction to our more moderate lit. mags, then that was a) one good
thing about his acheivement and b) it is true of all innovation that it
challenges the "establishment" at some level.He didnt see the importabce of
the (ultimately) the political connection.As to Frank O'Hara, his
homosexuality would have been a significant political factor, even tho not
obvious at the time, and to some people, his poems would be just too strange
to deal with. A lot of writers (who are lauded today and made poet laureates
etc) would be quite hostile, even now, to O'Hara's poems. He WAS an
innovator. He influenced Ashbery - well you probably know that
story.However, your point about innovators, or certain Lang Poets fearing
emotion is worth thinking about.Perhaps many of us do. I'm interested in
those writers and the Black Mountain derivatees (eg would that include
Eshlemann?) but something that concerns me about them is  that in their very
passion for language etc they become humourless.Or tend to, or could. And I
have noticed that many (all?) of the "great" writers have a comic
sense.Swift,Rabellais, Stevens,Joyce,Ashbery (somewhat),James Tate (just
"locked on" to him),O'Hara,Bukowski,Ted Berrigan - even,dare i say it, Gerty
 Stein! Or there is a kind of surprised sureality about their vision. I just
read the (Laura's)intro to Laura Riding's poems(I hadnt read much of her if
anything), and despite the almost tortured struggle she has to reconcile
language and truth, her poems are extraordinary. And they're extraordinary
in a kind of comic vision that,say, Selima Hill of England seems to have.
But I dont mean that thus we dodge the "dark" things.They are implicit in
Riding and Stein - "inside" the words. No. But by innovation, I maybe mean
actually a return to certain fundamental forces in poetry.That said, I think
that in say, Ron Silliman's Tjanting the extraordinary concetration on
detail is almost revelatory. And the same things that move me in that work,
are what move me in a poem by Blake.(A poet in N.Z.,who has been influenced
by Zukovsky and some of the Lang Poets that I think is of extraordinary
ability, and has a kind of lyric intellection, is Michelle Leggott in her
book "Dia" for example.)There are, or seem to me to be little "epiphanies"
in his( R.S's) works - within (or between) the very sentences.So I dont
think that a return to certain Rupert Brookian, or Masefieldian thing, or
the Romantics as such.But I interested in the way certain writers have
picked up the "deep image" and combined it with the quotidian.(This is a bit
roughly put I know.) Sometimes Anselm Hollo pulls off some excellent things
in "Microcosms", or remember Ted Berrigan's Sonnets with all their
borrowings and then the sudden realisation one gets that one is suddenly
there.Maybe Creeley too. I'm starting to wander, but, (I wouldnt knock Eliot
so much,I know he was a bit of a miserable old bugger...but...)and then
their's Jack Spicer. And me! I'll send some things I've done,am doing and
I'll discuss some of other points later.Looks as tho I'm getting too many
words!At least I've got off poor old Bei Ling's case.By the way, I'm not on
the attack against universities.I think they are vital,and the professors
who can inspire so much.Warm regards to you Bill and the others of
course,Richard.

I went to the Lingua Franca website and read the article "Is Bad Writing
Necessary," by Foucault biographer James Miller.  While based on a binary
opposition that might appear to be simplistic, the article makes reference
to an actually existing and quite interesting debate. I followed internet
links the the London Review of Books, where Eagleton reviews Gayatri
Spivak and is answered in a letter to the editor by Butler (Judith).  The
portraits of Orwell and Adorno that Miller presents are far from
simplistic; this article is not a simple middle-brow bashing of
theoretical jargon.  It is relatively well-informed and lively journalism.
It might have seemed superficial had I been reading it in Critical
Inquiry...

FW: insider for Sept. 12

A campaign ad for Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush
in which the word "RATS," a fragment of the word "bureaucrats," pops up
in one frame is raising questions about subliminal advertising. The
image lasts a 30th of a second, but is in large white letters, larger
than any other word in the commercial criticizing Democratic nominee Al
Gore's prescription drug plan as one that would be decided by
bureaucrats (Richard Berke, NEW YORK TIMES, 9/12). The ad was produced
by Alex Castellanos, who created the 1990 ad for Republican U.S. Sen.
Jesse Helms showing a pair of white hands crumbling a rejection letter
because the job went to a black man. It aired during Helms' campaign
against former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt. Castellanos, who produced
the 30-second Bush commercial for the Republican National Committee,
insisted use of the word "RATS" was "purely accidental," saying, "We
don't play ball that way. I'm not that clever." Asked when he noticed
it, Castellanos said, "That's all I want to say." The FCC does not
explicitly prohibit subliminal advertising, a spokesman said, but "we
have policy statements and public notices that indicate they are
inherently intended to be deceptive and might be contrary to the public
interest."

There you can read HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT FAST ON LANGUAGE DIET, BROOKLYN PROF  SLAYS BAD THINKING AND SELF, WHY RUDY HATED COLLEGE and many other delights -- AND the back is filled with something that looks suspiciously like PERSONALS ads -- LINGUA FRANCA has attempted to match this with cover come-ons like AN MLA MEMBER IN THE WHITE HOUSE?, but the CHRONICLE comes out weekly, as any good tabloid should --

        they substitute might

POETRY CENTER 2000
The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

Special evening with Vancouver poets
SUSAN CLARK & LISA ROBERTSON
Thursday, September 14, 7:30 pm, $5 donation
@ the Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

Treat yourself & don't miss this evening from two of Canada's finest--

Poet SUSAN CLARK, best known south of the border here in the U.S. for her
role as editor of the long-lived poetry journal Raddle Moon
(http://www.sfu.ca/~clarkd/raddlemoon/), has been a major bridge-builder
between writers working in innovative traditions in Canada, Great Britain,
and the U.S.  She also works as editor on the collaborative publishing
projects Giantess and Sprang Texts.  Ms. Clark is author of Believing in
the World: a reference work (Tsunami) and several as-yet-unpublished mss.,
including the truly long poem Bad Infinity, that she says is "about
everything."  *  LISA ROBERTSON's books XEclogue and Debbie: An Epic (both
from New Star) have been astounding readers and become new classics of our
post-millennial moment.  Debbie was nominated for Canada's highest literary
prize, the Governor-General's Award.  Recently in San Francisco briefly,
she debuted her new work, The Weather (forthcoming from New Star).  Both
Ms. Clark and Ms. Robertson have been affiliated with Vancouver's
adventurous Kootenay School of Writing for over a decade.

"Robertson is a poet of breathtaking originality" --Kevin Killian.

"I feel I've made 'things' too long and have come to abhor their making.
This blowsy nothing--'my book--is the result.  The endless, endless,
endless, neglected, obsessed over and into book.  Agglomerative, bulgy;
insultingly, needlessly big. . . . Made to be for 'everything' but not a
container. . . . Overwhelm is where I live; it interests me to examine its
positive values!  To take it on as a determined practice."  --Susan Clark
(on Bad Infinity)

hi dodie, yeah, lingua franca is lots of fun, and it's certainly more
substantive than many of us feared when we first learned it was coming into
existence.  it just has its drawbacks is all, and because the treatment is
often so thorough and thoughtful it's harder to see the marketing
strategies of journalism that still obtain.  love you madly --md

Dear Folks,

I would like to apologize for some quotes attributed to me in an interview
that appears
in the latest HIGHWIRE ANTHOLOGY edited by Greg Fuchs and Kyle Conner....
Especially in regards to Wendy Kramer.
First, I did NOT say, "She's Wet Like A child,"
Second, all the comments about Wendy were meant to be absolutely positive,

childlike(ness) as a virtue---

and this in fact was probably even the rationale of the editors on
publishing an excerpt
(ill-transcribed at that) of a drunken transcript with me.....

and i very much appreciate Mr. Fuchs and Mr. Conner's decision to do so....

but still feel a need to offer an apology,

to honor the Apollonian professional identity alienation so important these
days
when it comes to reputation.....


and hope I did not create (unintentionally) yet another enemy....

chris stroffolino-------------

P.S. Beware of magazines/journals that reject your work on the grounds

"i understand that you and many others associate binaries with war and
sports teams, but that doesn't make the very structure of a binary repulsive
or ignorant in any way."

Quite right. Saussure has much to say about this, without which we would all
stand mute.

I snipped a lot you said about taste, Taylor, which sounds interesting
to me but outside what I believe I was talking about, which is simply
that pain is never pleasure or vice versa.  They are opposites.

To say, as you do, that it's not a matter of "defeating" disgust or
pain, but of disgust or pain being pleasure under certain concrete
conditions," seems to me insane.  Black is white under certain
conditions.  Being dead is being alive under certain conditions.
I can conceive of black being changed to white, or death to life,
but while black is black it cannot be white, nor can death be life.

> And this is consistent in the other direction
> as well - a stranger fondling my genitals on the bus uninvited occurs > to me as violation, regardless of whether my body responds in the ways > typical of "pleasure."

So you experience a mixture of pain and pleasure.  You do not experience
pain as pleasure.

Maybe not, but I don't follow you.  By pleasure I mean that which
makes a given person feel good in some way.  It has nothing to do
with "the practices and preferences of other people."  If a
nonconformist derives pleasure from a poem that makes everyone else
vomit he is sane; if he reads that poem in hopes ONLY that it will cause
him to be sick (assuming being sick is painful for him), then he is
insane.

The difference between "getting pleasure from" and "wanting that which"
gives nothing but pain in the short term, and leads to no conceivable
plesure in the long term, is that the first is about feeling good, the
second about feeling bad.  How can it be sane to want to feel bad--
unless what caused you to feel bad will later make you feel more good
than you felt bad?

My observation depends on no model of pain/pleasure, just the simple
definition that the first is what makes a person feel bad, the second
what makes a person feel good.

Hi, Igor.

Thanks for the list of anthologies, not all of which I've looked at.
No time to argue a very involved question (was there serious visual
poetry before the 20th century), but must say that I have a narrower
idea of visual poetry than most people, and that's what I'm talking
about.  I don't consider words and pictures sharing the page to be
visual poetry necessarily.  I think that in the past there were all
kinds of wonderful meldings of the verbal and the visual--but they had
little to do with making significant esthetic use of the way words can
look.

A parallel would be sound poetry, which I think new to the 20th century
even though opera has been with us since before Greece.

Some day maybe I'll have time to defend my proposition a lot better--
and I certainly would agree with anyone who thinks I haven't studied
sufficient earlier work.

                                          always the best to you,
Bob

Well, you're interested in smaller originalities than I am.  Williams's
plums in the fridge poem, which I can't stand, did the main thing
O'Hara's "I did this, I did that" poems did.  But, yes, O'Hara's
personality was different than Williams's.  But all poetic oeuvres are
"original" in the sense that they express different people's
personalities, since all personalities are different.

Snip of stuff about O'Hara that's interesting but I was just reacting
to the idea of untimidity of personality indicating untimidity of
poetry, which it doesn't.

About all I've seen of ancient and medieval visio-textual art was the
stuff in Dick Higgins's big gathering, and nothing I saw made any
impression on me.

I guess.  But concrete poetry is a form of visual poetry.

Well, I don't know what Kuzminsky has or how good it is.  All I know is
that I'm aware of visual poetry that is verbally as innovative as
language poetry, in my view--and also visually innovative.  I simply
don't see how language poetry can be as innovative as visual poetry.

Like O'Hara, he had a unique personality.  I fail to find any genuine
innovation in his poetry.  To me, he's just an improved Thomas Hardy
(though that's a lot, since Hardy was a major poet, it seems to me).

I didn't say anything about sell-outs.  I was merely sketchily
explaining why there are attacks on academics.  Professors work inside
the establishment, artists can work there, too, but usually don't.
So there's friction between the two.

Nothing except that, except for a very few rare exceptions, they use
their power to reward mediocrity while the van Goghs have to wait until
they've been dead fifty years to make anything whatever from their art.

Snip of opinion about the value of academics as conservators of
dead artists' work, which they are, and for which they are to be
commended.  But why must they also throw so much support to
contemporary imitators of dead artists' work?

Incidentally, it's not "cummings," but "Cummings."

No.  There is, however, a connection between the kind of adventurousness
that finds following years of rules to become a Ph.D.and then
professor difficult and the ability to produce innovative art.

One terrific dead writer after another, followed by living imitators.
As for power, I mentioned it merely to suggest why otherstream artists
resent academics.  The latter have the power to help the former, and
don't.

Alan Loney had seemed to me (he wrote many editorials which were interesting

but constantly complained of him and the "avant garde" (altho I dont think

he used that term) being relegated to the margins etc) to be that

"oppositional" writing, as he called it, was being rejected, and that the

more conservative or "realist" writers, many of whom are pretty dull in

fact, were still dominating the scene. But Geraets didnt see the point that,

if Loney is a major N.Z. poet (and significant enough or original

enough)(and I like his work very much)to be "disturbing the universe" say in

contradistinction to our more moderate lit. mags, then that was a) one good

thing about his acheivement and b) it is true of all innovation that it

challenges the "establishment" at some level.He didnt see the importabce of

the (ultimately) the political connection.As to Frank O'Hara, his

homosexuality would have been a significant political factor, even tho not

obvious at the time, and to some people, his poems would be just too strange

to deal with. A lot of writers (who are lauded today and made poet laureates

etc) would be quite hostile, even now, to O'Hara's poems. He WAS an

innovator. He influenced Ashbery - well you probably know that

story.However, your point about innovators, or certain Lang Poets fearing

emotion is worth thinking about.Perhaps many of us do. I'm interested in

those writers and the Black Mountain derivatees (eg would that include

Eshlemann?) but something that concerns me about them is  that in their very

passion for language etc they become humourless.Or tend to, or could. And I

have noticed that many (all?) of the "great" writers have a comic

sense.Swift,Rabellais, Stevens,Joyce,Ashbery (somewhat),James Tate (just

"locked on" to him),O'Hara,Bukowski,Ted Berrigan - even,dare i say it, Gerty

 Stein! Or there is a kind of surprised sureality about their vision. I just

read the (Laura's)intro to Laura Riding's poems(I hadnt read much of her if

anything), and despite the almost tortured struggle she has to reconcile

language and truth, her poems are extraordinary. And they're extraordinary

in a kind of comic vision that,say, Selima Hill of England seems to have.

But I dont mean that thus we dodge the "dark" things.They are implicit in

Riding and Stein - "inside" the words. No. But by innovation, I maybe mean

actually a return to certain fundamental forces in poetry.That said, I think

that in say, Ron Silliman's Tjanting the extraordinary concetration on

detail is almost revelatory. And the same things that move me in that work,

are what move me in a poem by Blake.(A poet in N.Z.,who has been influenced

by Zukovsky and some of the Lang Poets that I think is of extraordinary

ability, and has a kind of lyric intellection, is Michelle Leggott in her

book "Dia" for example.)There are, or seem to me to be little "epiphanies"

in his( R.S's) works - within (or between) the very sentences.So I dont

think that a return to certain Rupert Brookian, or Masefieldian thing, or

the Romantics as such.But I interested in the way certain writers have

picked up the "deep image" and combined it with the quotidian.(This is a bit

roughly put I know.) Sometimes Anselm Hollo pulls off some excellent things

in "Microcosms", or remember Ted Berrigan's Sonnets with all their

borrowings and then the sudden realisation one gets that one is suddenly

there.Maybe Creeley too. I'm starting to wander, but, (I wouldnt knock Eliot

Well, I read the above and . . .damn . . . can't find anything to really
disagree with, except that Ashbery is a whole lot funnier that you suggest.
Somewhat funny?  Nah, the guy is a riot!  And even the darkest poets of our
century didn't forget to be funny, as you imply.  Perhaps I'll just add a
note of clarification.  I'm not hard on Eliot's poetry.  Despite some
currently fashionable views, "The Waste Land" may still be seen as the
primier poetic document--and mightily avant garde--of the 20th century.  The
man was a genius.  On the other hand, if he were alive today, I wouldn't
invite that old bigot to dinner.  And I would never accuse you of trashing
Profs.  You're obviously too bright, and your brush never that broad.  As I
said, I was using your comments as a springboard to deal with several issues
raised on the list, some of which had little to do with your original post.
It was easier than posting over and over.  But mostly I agree with you on the
warm regards to all.  The give and take is as beneficial as dirty sex for the
circulatory system.  Well, almost.  Hard to beat those nasty pleasures.
Richard, you're okay in my poetry book.  Best, Bill

James,

It seems I respond to your comments instinctively more than to any other
person's.
I have two issues with your comments on Herbert:

The first is to the phrase "decorative only." The "decorative" may be an
intensely intellectual experience; it has something to do with the creation
of a meditative space. In fact, my essay on decorative poetics around a
review of Ed Friedman's "Mao & Matisse" in the most recent issue of Big
Bridge (http://www.bigbridge.org/) deals exactly with that idea.

The second is your referring to Herbert's poetry as "decorative only" (this
time in your sense of decorative). I assume you are referring to "Easter
Wings." The poem, as I experience the poem, is a visual and rhythmical
incarnation of despair or the fall (as a progressively narrowing sense of
possibilities) being transformed into a progressively expanding sense of
possibilities through the Holy Ghost. That's what the wing shape is, death
and rebirth of (and in) Christ. It seems to me Hopkins's "God's Grandeur" has
"easter Wings" behind it, so does a less familiar poem, my "I hear wings in
the foliage" (with its peculiar shape), in "Io's Song."

My third point relates to the supposed "inferiority" of visual poetry. I
don't think Robert Grenier is any less imaginative than any language poets.

Does it make sense to say that, while a two-party system is not inherently
wrong, it's pretty much certain to turn out that way? Two choices is,
effectively, no choice. As Pope once said,

It's the same rope at different ends they twist.

In Australia the main choice is between Labour and Liberal (there are a
number of smaller parties but with no chance of gaining power in
parliament). For the Labour voter, this means an increasingly conservative
Labour Party can screw you in a variety of ways, knowing you might vote
Green but you'll never vote Liberal.
On a state level, we've got a Labour Government doing its best to sabotage
the public school system and drive parents to private schools. Those who
can't afford them will have to put up with declining standards of education
that will ensure few rise above the socio-economic status which has already
condemned them to inferior schooling. And this from a party that used to be
identified with the working class. The alternative is no better. Perhaps it
would be fair to add that the chief virtue of the two-party system is its
stability, though, as this becomes a constant vindication of the status quo,
one might want to question this also.
Didn't mean to go on like that.

        One thing which does seem to link both Bei-Ling and the person
assaulted in the message here is: economics.  That is, Bei-Ling's journal
was charged with not following basically economic rules--and the person
here is charged with basically protesting an economic power move.

        In both cases what is being challenged is the economic hegemony,
whether that of the State or that of the capitalist free enterprisers.

        The economic challenge in both cases is liked to art--in its forms
of distribution, and its forms of production (loft spaces).

        These in turn are linked by the powers-that-be to the supression
of other minority points of view and rights, all with economic
implications.

        Thanks to Mr. Cook for calling attention to the interrelation of
these two cases.

        Patrick:

        I didn't make my point very well--

        what i meant was that in such a world where binaries are so
prevalent, calling Lingua Franca's tactics "idiotic binaries' seems much
akin to the Claude Rains character in CASABLANCA  proclaiming loudly
"Gambling going on ! I'm shocked! Shocked!"

        it seems like an act of "bad faith"

        i don't have any problems with binaries--after all this entire
discussion could not take place without the binary set up used by computer
circuitry!

        personally as a philosphical way of thinking, i prefer "both/and"
to "either/or"--

        but what i meant in this case was not a critique of the binary
oppostions, but a note that to attack the Lingua Franca piece as (or not)
making use of "idiotic binaries" in itself reveals the prevalence of the
binary thinking in our culture--

        that is, by implication, it suggests that the author (and an
implied knowing "we")--are distinguishing their binaries from the
"iditioc" ones of Lingua Franca--that is, that there is an implied binary
in the statement, in which Lingua Franca is the "bad subject position"--

        the critique in this case of "idiotic binaries" is trappd in its
own reflection of binary thinking, which it claims to find "idiotic"

          i only meant that i found this ironic--

I'm not certain what is meant by the term being used "binary". I know what the binary number system is. Obviously it has to do with either or. Do people using this term mean that by "binary" thinking one categorises everything into opposites? Or some theory that any movement or ideational "progress" in one direction inevitably produces a counterforce? Is it thinking stolen from pseudo science or what? And what exaxtly is meant by visual poetry? I know about concrete poetry and the significance of layout etc but I'm not certain of how the term applies.Could someone enlighten me? I've seen some of Peter Finch's pomes, and that "exploded poem" by Steve McCaffery... Serious persons need only (apply) reply. And to whoever: Zukovsky wasnt a Zucchini.Dont see many Zucchini's in N.Z. but I believe they're insinuating there way into the new fangled coffee bars. But he wasnt far away from being a Bukowski. Perhaps Bukowski was Zukovsky's secret other who wrote the "I drank this I drank
  that,then I smacked somethin against the wall, and vomited lovin'ly over me lovely lady and then the bitch left me" poems in his spare time! Then he went back to his minor works such as `A' But back to my questions. Richard.

        There's an interview with Michael Palmer in the Spring 2000
issue of _jubilat_ that focuses on some of this, with questions like:

        "Is there a danger, now that the l=a=n=g=u=a=g=e poets and
you have been more widely incorporated into what is considered to
be American poetry, of becoming misincorporated?"

        This is the direct link to a snippet of the interview (the whole
thing is well worth reading, natch):

Anywhere out there have any suggestions as to how I might obtain (and

Adad


This is for her, gold and juniper orchards, everyone was named Adad and
used the "Adad," and then there was Izanami and Izanagi, did I mention I
brought all these people whose names I knew to live there, from Adad? I'm
the terrific warrior, did I say thanks to her and her, and I walk all over
Adad and "Adad," they also came along, all of them. All the streams and
rocks, and even the grains of sand, to their fullest and nothing surprises
me. And I built a palace of curved jewels and gold and swords and cedar
because I knew their names and maybe they don't, and this includes breath,
swoon, and languor. Ir\emum takes her, seizing her, called the Dragon-Lion
and the Lion-Dragon, and with one naming I can take her. It's all over; I
can taste her and hear and see; i can't breathe much. It's too much to see
her and hear in an instant of an eye, the interior of her body. "Adad" was
her lover, I took her mouth, I didn't know where I was.

>Bill.I've often seen similarities between Eliot and Williams. They both were exquisite, and usually "spot on" witheir imagery or imagism (if those are the right terms). E.g. Eliot's "details" like "sawdust restaurants with oyster shells" and other things like "twists like a crooked pin" is only slightly more indirect than W.C.W's piece of green glass between the wings of the "contagious" hospital. They're not that far away. But of course WCW moved away from "metaphor" and so on. But the main difference was probably temperament and philosophy. I think you've got in for the old Posssum. W.C.W's was no saint. Sure his influence is a good "antidote" to some of the more florid parts of say The Waste Land. O'Hara, I agree, was very innovative. He is close to Williams in the sense of lifefullness that comes thru and in W's sometimes slightly sureal sense of the real. I dont know the history, but I suppose T.S. "put the boot into" Williams. Another point is that none of them were pa
 rticularly radical in their politics. This was (or it leads me into thinking about)the (gist of the) thing Scott Hamilton was challenging Geraets about in a letter to ABDOTWW, and one of the "questions" that arose parallels the supposed "sell out" of Silliman etc in that Leigh Davis (an avowed and open supporter of Capitalism) was or is being published by ABDOTWW yet they are supposeedly "oppositional", or "avant-garde". But it is a debate only because there is obviously no direct correlation between eg who or at what salary level you work for and one's poetry.(Scott had pointed out that Davis, the "avant-garde" writer, was a (very rich) member of a big finance company that had helped to destroy N.Z.'s economy over the last 15 years or so.) An example in music is Charles Ives (but I think Ives took to making himself into a multi-millionaire after his music got hardly any interest or was actively scorned), and of course there's Stevens.(Or they are "counter-examples.) This is
  all part of a rather complicated discussion.But I thought it might parallel the McClatchy accusations against (some?) LangPo exponents. But Scott wasnt attacking the innovative writing in ABD as such.
 Although I thought that the "accusations" of Scott's were a bit simplistic it (his initial letter)they generated some interesting issues. I felt that they were not suffuciently attended to. For example, I wrote to Geraets to the effect that it was paradoxical that Zukovsky, who was Jewish, was a great friend of Pound (as was Williams) who (Pound)was pretty close to being a Nazi. And somewhat Z. is one of LangPo's heroes and how to reconcile that or these things with the Marxist "branch" ?And so forth.I also "asked" or tried to "open up" other questions.E.g. what is the connection between a poet and their philosophy/politics? Can poetry be apolitical? There were a lot of issues that were left unanswered which I felt reflected rather badly on the Writers Group (whom Scott accused of being elitist). I didnt see it in such severe terms as Scott but I was disappointed that other members of (those who contribute to ABDOTWW) didnt join in the discussion.i've drifted here a bit, but
  I'm working on the other points you mentioned. By the way at least you and Bob write in a way that is relatively clear.
  Maybe I should just load or inflict my poems on the list instead like Alan Sondheim does.He's writing some amusing and interesting stuff.What do you think?Regards,Richard.

Dear List:

Just back from a week in Korea where I spent some time with the =
incredible Brother Anthony of Taize.  This self-effacing man has =
produced a series of translations of contemporary Korean poets that is =
truly amazing.  Not much is known about new poetry in Korea because of =
the dearth of good translations.  Please visit his site at:

http://www.sogang.ac.kr/~anthony/poetry.htm

His translations of Ku Sang and Kwang-kyu Kim are available from Forest =
Books/ 61 Lincoln Road, Wayland, MA. 01778.  The Cornell East Asia =
Series carries his translations of Chon Sang Pyong--one of the most =
popular of contemporary Korean poets--as well as the major poet Ko Un's =
selected poems, The Sound of Many Waves.  Ko Un's Beyond Self is =
available from Parallax Press. =20

I was most impressed with the range of Ko Un's poetry--from Zen (in =
Korean, Son) meditations, to unforgettable portraits of people from Ko =
Un's childhood, to intensely political works.  Anthony's translations =
are fine poems in themselves.

Anthony has also translated Yi Mun-yol's The Poet,a must read for anyone =
interested in 19th c. Korean verse.  This novel tells the true story of =
Kim Sakkat, a fallen aristocrat turned wandering poet.  This book is =
available from The Harvill Press, 84 Thornhill Road, London, N1 1RD.

I wish I could relay the impact that Anthony had on me: his introducing =
the stories of these poets; the harsh conditions in which they found =
their voice and practiced their craft.  I urge anyone interested in =
Asian poetry to read these books.  Jesse Glass

But as I read the comments of Dodie and others, the objection was never to "twoness" per se -- rather to the reduction of a complex array of phenomena to a binary opposition -- This may work well enough when the binary opposition is between a voiced and voiceless fricative, but certainly seems more suspect when arranged between "good writing" and "intellectual rigor" -- or between poets who have spent the last twenty years denouncing the academy and poets who have spent the last twenty years denouncing academic workshop verse.

well this is the thing about lingua franca. there's generally some real
substance there, which makes the framing somewhat frustratingly idiotic.

Murat, to get Bill Austin off the hook, it was I, not he, who claimed
that the visuality of Herberts' poems were only decorative.  You give a
good argument that "Easter Wings" uses visuality in a more than
merely decorative way, though.

(To check, I've been thumbing through Dick Higgins's Pattern Poetry, and
now suspect I'll have to admit to being . . . wrong.  I over-reacted
to what I took as one more claim that contemporary visual poets aren't
doing anything significantly new; that's something I'll never agree to.

As for decoration, it can certainly do marvelous things, but it is
by definition secondary.  My point, which may not be valid, is that
only in the twentieth century did visio-textual artists make poetry
(of consequence) whose visual elements are equal or superior to (and
interdependent, not merely co-existing, with) its verbal elements.

As for Bob Gregory's poetry, it makes my point that a poet working
in the verbal AND the visual would have to be more innovative, other
things being equal, to a poet working in the verbal alone: Gregory
has been as innovative a language poet verbally as anyone around--
and he is carrying his langpo verbal innovativeness now into visual
poems (as are a few other language poets).

Steve Ellis of Oasis Press has brought out an attractive chapbook (or, in
his word, "fascicle") of my poems called *September Song* -- some of you who
"know" me only from intermittent posts on this list or another might be
interested in checking them out. If so, please back-channel me for the
mailing information.

It's almost old news already, but I found Andrew Epstein's piece in *Lingua
Franca* on langpo "infiltration" into the academy scrupulously even-handed,
a model of fine journalism, and recommend it highly. I touched on these
matters myself in a panel presentation last week on "21st century poetry,"
and could also send those notes out to anyone who can open Word or RTF
attachments.

Thanks,

Joe Safdie

"all poetry is visual poetry, all poetry is language poetry, don't
create separate fiefdoms like 'genuinely visual poetry'"  Jonathan
Mayhew

Sure, and all words are visual poetry and all art is visual poetry
and all human endeavors are visual poetry and all everything is
visual poetry--and now we have no danger of, gasp, separate fiefdoms.

But if we want to be able to communicate, we need to distinguish
forms of poetry from one another, and distinguish a given form of
of poetry (like "genuine visual poetry") from forms of poetry that
people wrongly consider to be that form of poetry.

Maxim: intelligence is directly proportionate to the largeness of
one's generalities, and indirectly proportionate to the number and
minuteness of the specifics one is able to distinguish between.

"a lot of so called visual poetry"

I thought all poetry is visual poetry.

        There is no working definition for visual poetry--Karl Young

        (Looking over this i note that a brief note turned into
         a long performance directed into the vastness of cyberspace
         --fortuitously for the reader risking eye and brain
        and patience damage in its perusal--it may always be
        deleted and sent back into the wastes from which it came--)

        i greatly respect Bob Grumman's ideas re visual poetry, and all
        poetries.

        i believe that visual poetry is the oldest form of notation.
        visual poetry is quite different from lexical/verbal poetry in
        that the latter is based on measure--it is a time art
        visual poetry spatializes the notations in such a way that the
        reader moves among the texts/images--the montage or intersign poetry as
        Philadelpho Menezes called it

        the usual "strict time" or "keeping time" of verbal poetry is
        non-existent
        this opens the visual poet to all manner of performances, oral and
        through body movements, gestures, howlings, shriekings, sound poetry
        performances
        visual poetry is interactive in a huge number of possible
        ways--many of them ways that verbal poetry is not
        as well, the visual poem, like the sound poem, is not a completely
        "fixed text"
        that is, it remains "open" literally to/for/ with/by  the
        reader/viewer/sounder/performer



        a definition i have given for a web site collection of "minimal
        definitions of visual poetry"  is this:

        visual poetry is a hieroglyph of site/sight/cite
        the site of the page, the sight of the image, the cite
        of sounds of letters, syllables, words
        visual poetry is a palimptsest of memory, dream,
        imagination and concrete fact

        (http://www.fut.es/~boek861/poesia_visual.htm)

        if you examine the definitions provided by the wonderful
        array of other visual poets at this site, you will find that the
        definition of visual poetry is indeed open ended
        and mine is simply mine--for that particular site and time
        as it is continually in flux as one studies and makes more
        it may alsways be developing--one hopes so!

        many of the commentators and detractors of visual poetry are
        people who have not made an effort to seriously study the works
        --although happily now there are some new anthologies available
        for the most part visual poetry as always is found in journals,
        and from small presses such as Bob's Runaway Spoon press
        (and happily with the new media--on web sites and distirbuted on
        CD Rom)

        (as well as in performances at exhibitions and conferences held
        continually throughout the world)

        given what is often presented in the academy as "visual poetry"
        one can literally "see" why the entire area of visual and sound
        poetries is treated for the most part as a kind of curiosity, rather than
        a vital and generative area of work, practised internationally by workers
        of excellent quality

        a good deal of work that passes itself off as "visual poetry" done
        by workers coming from a language centered orientation is not
        visual poetry--it is primarily concerned with the playing around
        of
        arrangements of typefaces and having words move in more than one
        direction

        (this aspect was noted by one commentator to the list, who
        contended that this is basically what "visual poetry" is)


        a major exception is the work of Robert Grenier

        since Bob Grumman brought up the puritans--
        language centered writing and its approaches with visual poetry
        strike one as being of the "puritan" school
        that is, language centered writing in many of its stated
        objectives, is a form of writing that is antithetical to
        visual poetry, as well as many other poetries

        this is not a binary statement or a value judgement--
        simply an observation based on statements made

        i have heard a talk by Johanna Drucker for example in
        which she stated that the "material word"
        would be basically a form of visual poetry that
        has nothing to do with the senses whatsoever
        this is a very puritanical conception of the text

        --basically an anti-idol worshipping and graven image making kind
        of stance

        one of the innovations of much language writing came from its
        essaying to work through various aspects of Russian formalism

        (the earlier developments of formalism and New Criticism
        in Britain and the USA
        also made use of the works of the Russian and Czech formalists,
        though in a somewhat different manner due to the lesser
        availability of texts then in English)

        aspects of Russian formalism--the work of Schlovsky in his earlier
        phases for example--were involved with aspects of the visual poetries of
        Russian Futurism--most notably the idea of the "Word as Such" proclaimed
        by Kruchonhyk and Khlebnikov in a joint manifesto

        (Kruchonyhk and Khlebnikov then proceeded in quite different
        directions--see an excellent brief history and analysis for example in
        RUSSIAN FORMALISM  A Metapoetics  Peter Steiner
        (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1984  pp.143-146, 149-151)
        also see Markov's HISTORY OF RUSSIAN FUTURISM
        and the two superb books by Gerald Janecek  THE LOOK OF
        RUSSIAN LITERATURE  and ZAUM  The Transrational Poetry of Russian
        Futurism

        the visual aspects become dropped when a puritanical conception of
        the word, or "material word" or "materiality of language"
        are emphasized by the formalism of language centered writing

        since the cultural influence of puritanism remains ever strong in
        the usa, what is acceptable in the academy and more and more so
        by areas of the so called mainstream--are bound to be works
        coming from the language centered sphere, and not those of
        visual poetry, which for Philadelpho Menezes is that of the
        "intersign" and the "intermedia" (as opposed to "multimedia)

        the latter in a sense are too "contaminated"
        (not puritan in the pure sense)

        even within visual poetry this idea is acknowledged for example in
        the distinction made since the Sixties between "clean" and "dirty"
        work

        I think that Bob Grumman made a distinction which is generally
        held to be more or less true--that modern visual poetry is initiated by
        Mallarme's "Un Coup de des"

        Mallarme's poem is basically a book--a visual/sound work of book
        art

        book art is one of the significant developments of modern visual
        poetry since then, through many movements and modes of making and
        presentation to the present

        though it also present in much older forms--scrolls, papyri,
        Egyptian and Mayan and other texts incised or painted on rocks,
        THE BOOK OF KELLS, THE BOOK OF HOURS, the works of Blake,
        many many others from around the world

        modern sound poetry was so named in the 1950s by Henri Chopin, one
        of the pioneers of working with electromagnetic tape.  the origins
        of this
        are usually held to be with the phonetic poetries of Futurism
        (Italian  and Russian) and Dada

        both sound and visual poetry --in  my view--are really the first
        poetries

        Russian Futurist Zaum for example was influenced by the
        glossollalia of those in a state of religious ecstasy or "being
        beside/outside" oneself--"speaking in tongues"--whose origins are lost in
        the sands of time

        it should be noted that historically in the west an interest,
        renewed, in the visual poetry aspects of written language
        often coincides with the introduction of new technologies for the
        reproduction of texts

        as well as with the historical attempts to decipher the various
        hieroglyphic languages--especially, in the west prior to the conquest of
        the new world--that of the Egyptians

        the introduction of the printing press came about in an era of
        great interest in the hieroglyphs and as well helped to bring about the
        creation of "pattern poetry"

        modern visual and sound poetries have developed along with the
        introduction of photography, the telegraph and telephone, the radio and
        film, aerial photography, the x-ray, the sonar, the radar, the
        mimeograph machine, the typewriter, the xerox machine, the
        computer technologies

        modern visual and sound poetries have also had a deep
        interelationship with the modern movements in painting, performance
        and a remewed interest in  handwritten notations


        a strong current in american poetry has been the relationship with
        the visual--beginning with the interest in and influence of the Egyptian
        hieroglyphics during the American renaissance (see John irwin's AMERICAN
        HIEROGLYPHICS) and extending via the Fenollosa/Pound work THE CHINESE
        WRITTEN CHARACTER AS A MEDIUM FOR POETRY into the work of pound--while
        William Carlos Williams looked to contemporary painting (as did Gertrude
        Stein) for an example--and Olson, coming out of the Pound-Williams
        tradition, turned to the Mayan hieroglyphs

        William Burroughs has also been a strong advocate for the study and
        use of hieroglyphic writing in the making of visual/sound texts and
        performances

        Kerouac used the visual technique of "sketching" in relation to
        page size as a dictation of the time frame of poetry to produce
        sound poetry texts from haiku to his book length OLD ANGEL
        MIDNIGHT

        much american folk art as well as "outsider art" deals with forms
        of visual poetry--for example the old signs one still finds for example
        for a hardware store--a saw hanging in front of the store and so on ad
        infinitum

        graffiti or tagging and its relationships with hip hop music and
        performance are another living example of the "open field" aspects
        of visual poetry and sound poetry
        (intersign and intermedia)

        unfortunately in the united states, due to the pronounced
        influence of still of puritanism and in the 20th century that of
        formalism, the actually central fact of visual poetry as a vital
        ongoing project of american writing/notation has been
        greatly ignored

        in fact visual poetry often is treated as the works of Poe often
        were by the traditions of american formalism:

        "a find for french eyes" --as noted in a post to this list which
        dismissed visual poetry as something interesting done at one point by the
        French and the Brazilians

        Kerouac wrote of "book movie"--"the visual American form"

        long before the arrival of the puritans on what is now the shores
        of the usa, the Ojibway people were making a visual poetry notation of
        their language which still exists today

        "Ojibway" is the name given by other tribes and nations and it
        means
        "the people who write"

        the Ojibway name for themselves is Inishnabe--"first people"

        It is a very sad and typical fact of american culture and history
        to ignore its own deepest as Gilles Deleuze would call it
        "rhizomes"--and attempt instead to eradicate them and put in their
        place something else, much cleaner, much more "material"
        much more "safe" and much more easily "territorialized"
        and "colonized"

        on the other hand, while i hope as does Bob Grumman for more
        recognition for visual poetry, i also hope that it does not become
        "colonized" or that there are never arguments about it as with
        language centered writing--has it been assimilated, is it pure, what is
        its relationship with the academy ad infinitum ad nauseaum

        i doubt there will be--given the overall cultural "structure of
        feeling" as the British cultural critics say

        some aspects will be appropriated and formalized and
        canonized--and then put away safely, as they already have been,
        by various "authorities"--and that way a certain easing of the
        conscience may be felt--we have dispensed with THAT! now to
        the more serious work at hand


        that is, the puritan, formalist project in its various
        guises and generations

        i shd. note that these are my own ides and views--
        and as well--i am not trying to set up binaries
        the puritan and non-puritan are part of one another
        yin-yang

        that one may try to eradicate the other--is an historical fact

        it is also a fact that many aspects of art and thought
        which are "foreign" or "international" are historically
        regarded as dangerous and in need of being rubbed out
        in the usa--for example the internationalism of the
        anarchists (massive public executions in Chicago in the
        1880s, murders extending through the period of the I.W.W.
        to the Sacco and Vanzetti executions--suppresion of
        internationalism of communism and Socialism, beginning
        during WW1 and put into full force with the Palmer Raids,
        the development of the FBI--extended now to the mass
        media exportation of american culture throughout the
        world, to effectively  make a super economic/cultural/military
        power--

        in this regard one notes some of the comments on this list
        as being part of the cultural heritage of "manifest
        destiny"

        that is--many aspects of the international intersign of
        visual and sound poetries need to be eradicated for the
        americanization and colonization of the areas in
        order for them to be made part of the "american scene"
        culturally

        and to "fit in" with already constructed presentations of the
        possibilities of language

        well, i shall conclude this intermedia soap box performance of
        singing, signing, notating, gesticulating, spray painting,
        montaging of elements

        ("It is not the elements which are new, but the order of their
         of their arrangement"--Pascal")

        with two quotations torn from the Book of Hope

        (i.e. that visual/sound poetries are not fatally
         colonized . . . )

        (hope being perhaps the most obdurate of human emotions)

        "Creation survives in fragments under the ruins of a world
         for which we can no longer find expression."

        W. Weidle, L'IMMORTALITE DES MUSES
        qtd.  in Hans Richter, DADA  ART AND ANTI-ART (New York:
        McGraw-Hill p. 214).

        "Not only do the words change meanings but meanings vary locally
        at the same time.  A final glossary, therefore, cannot be made of
        words whose intentions are fugitive."
        William S. Burroughs, JUNKIE (NY: Ace Editions, 2nd Edition,
        p. 17)

        The intentions of visual poetry are not fugitive--it is just that
        they have been made so in their reception within the culture of
        the usa.  As an international and at the same time intensely local
        language of the intersign, it is not surprising that this
        situation should exist--for it exists at the peripheries
        of the areas of american control and spheres of influence.

        yet also is embedded within american culture, despite
        attempts at its eradication

        what the heck, one more quotation, with emphasis on the both/and
        of "here/there":

        "A Dadaist is someone who loves life in all its uncountable form,
        and one who knows, and says that, "Life is not here alone,
        but there, there, there (da, da, da)."

        Johannes Baader
         in Die freie Strasse, berlin, December 1918
        qtd. in Richter, p. 215


        To conclude (this to a snoozing audience of winos and babies, and
        to blissfully unaware lovers and to the relief of the beat policemen--
        as well as the birds and insects whose meals are being put off by
        the noise of this gesticulating spray painting hieroglyphic
        figure--
        ceding at last the soap box to the self proclaimed Leader of the
        Quest for Righteousness--)

        visual poetry is a bridge among modern visual poetry and sound
        poetry methods, presentations, notations, and technologies
        and ancient ones

        visual poetry is also there already as a bridge among american
        poetries
        and international poetries--
        a bridge too often ignored or put under the process of demolition
        and make over
        of dismissal and dissing--
        as an "away zone"
        useless until . . . the zoning commitees get hold of it--

Damn, Bob, the way you send to the list prohibits the simple reply unless I
cut and paste.  Backchannels go straight to you.  Hmmm . . .  Anyway, on to
your comments--

Well, you're interested in smaller originalities than I am.  Williams's
plums in the fridge poem, which I can't stand, did the main thing
O'Hara's "I did this, I did that" poems did.  But, yes, O'Hara's
personality was different than Williams's.  But all poetic oeuvres are
"original" in the sense that they express different people's
personalities, since all personalities are different.

Austin:  Not sure what small vs. large really means in art, or how much it
matters.  Something small can be far more potent than something bloated.  But
I don't agree that O'Hara's innovation is small, in any event.  His
particular take on the urbane sensibility seems astonishingly fresh to me and
had enormous influence on much of what came between New York School and
langpo.  That last, the influence, is a fact.  And differing personalities
should not be dismissed as a small thing--not that you're necessarily doing
that.  Aren't those differences the fuel for different innovative strategies?

Snip of stuff about O'Hara that's interesting but I was just reacting
to the idea of untimidity of personality indicating untimidity of
poetry, which it doesn't.

Austin:  We agree.

I did but don't feel you came close to answering the question.

Austin:  That's because I left out what I thought was obvious.  My mistake.
Surely in the world of visual arts vp might do better than langpo.  But I
thought the issue, and the thrust of your complaints, is that vp is
marginalized in the arena of literature.  If that's the issue, then my
comments stand.  Not enough language in vp for some in the literary
disciplines.  I assume you're not fighting for wall space at the galleries.
If what you're after is greater acceptance from literary critics, then you
have to deal with their tastes and biases.  The rest is irrelevant.  Those
who prefer visuals might indeed find poetry lacking, but we're not talking
about acceptance from them, are we?  In the world of painting, the
combination of word and image is pretty old news--which doesn't make any less
valuable today.

I dunno about that, but don't know enough or have to learn enough
to argue it.

Austin:  ok

About all I've seen of ancient and medieval visio-textual art was the
stuff in Dick Higgins's big gathering, and nothing I saw made any
impression on me.

> Herbert was a concrete poet, no?

I guess.  But concrete poetry is a form of visual poetry.

Austin:  This is an opinion I happen to agree with, only because the
parameters of vp are so broad.  On the other hand, all poetry on the page is
visual.  When we start gathering differences under one rubric, where do we
stop?  Your own definitions can be understood to apply to nearly everything,
including the rather conventional poem whose lines are occasionally indented,
in the sense that the visual placement of lines complements what is being
said.

Well, I don't know what Kuzminsky has or how good it is.  All I know is
that I'm aware of visual poetry that is verbally as innovative as
language poetry, in my view--and also visually innovative.  I simply
don't see how language poetry can be as innovative as visual poetry.

Austin:  My point was that as a general form, langpo was something fresh in
the eighties.  Vispo, as Igor has rightly claimed, is a thing revived.  But
this doesn't stop me from appreciating individual vispos more than certain
individual langpos.  And I made that point in a previous post.

Like O'Hara, he had a unique personality.  I fail to find any genuine
innovation in his poetry.  To me, he's just an improved Thomas Hardy
(though that's a lot, since Hardy was a major poet, it seems to me).

Austin:  Now here I have to say, keep reading.  Frost, that is.  Okay, you
can't find it.  I agree about Hardy's stature (it really isn't up for debate
anyway), but to suggest (if you are) that Frost's handling of the language is
just remixed Hardy, well there are a boatload of well considered critical
texts since WW II that say otherwise.  Of course they could all be wrong.

I didn't say anything about sell-outs.  I was merely sketchily
explaining why there are attacks on academics.  Professors work inside
the establishment, artists can work there, too, but usually don't.
So there's friction between the two.

Austin:  I didn't say you said it.  Actually these days it seems artists
usually do work in the establishment.  What else do we have to replace the
old patronage?  I guess Michelangelo worked for the ultimate establishment.
Didn't seem to hurt his art any.     And those who can't find positions
scramble to teach part time.   But you and a few others have complained on
the list about Profs, so my comments were meant to cover all that ground.
You have also referred in print to some critics as "idiots" for not devoting
their critical skills to very marginalized writers, for not turning over
every rock imaginable.  They may not all see things the way you do, but my
guess is that they're all fairly intelligent people who have good reasons for
the choices they make.  I don't know, could it be that many of them just
don't consider certain art very good?  The fiends!!

> And yes, certain few professors have power over
> cultural directions.  What's wrong with that?

Nothing except that, except for a very few rare exceptions, they use
their power to reward mediocrity while the van Goghs have to wait until
they've been dead fifty years to make anything whatever from their art.

Austin:  stereotype.  And Van Gogh's problems had little, if anything, to do
with the academy, and much more to do with the commercial tastes of art
dealers and his own illness.

Snip of opinion about the value of academics as conservators of
dead artists' work, which they are, and for which they are to be
commended.  But why must they also throw so much support to
contemporary imitators of dead artists' work?

Austin:  But they don't always.  Most of the artists in that bag make a small
reputation for themselves by getting published and winning prizes.  And those
journals and prizes are generally administered by conservative editors
(poets), state agencies, etc., that have very little to do with most Profs or
the academy in general.  When was the last time a major critical work was
devoted to a contemporary, conventionally narrative or lyric poet?  There are
a few works, but they're not major.  Most of the big shot Profs/critics are
writing about experimental work as far as I can tell.

Incidentally, it's not "cummings," but "Cummings."

Austin:  Incidentally, cummings alternately used lower and upper case in his
own signature (I have a facsimile in front of me right now of lower case in
his own hand), and various anthologies and editions of his work offer both
versions.  But this sort of thing reduces a civil albeit spirited discussion
to something very close to an ad hominem zinger.  Should I now correct the
spelling and grammatical errors in your posts?  Of course not!  I wouldn't do
that to anyone.  That would be rude and childish.

> Are we to believe there's some connection between the kind of
> personality that can't hold a job and the ability to produce quality
> poetry?!

No.  There is, however, a connection between the kind of adventurousness
that finds following years of rules to become a Ph.D.and then
professor difficult and the ability to produce innovative art.

Austin:  You say this as if it is fact.  But is it?  I guess you have your
personal reasons for investing in this idea.  Sounds a lot like that business
about type A personalities we use to hear so much about on the TV, that was
later shown to be a guess cum desire to simplify a very complicated
situation.       I know more than a few Profs whose very experimental work is
as marginal as it gets, but then again testimonials are not good evidence.
Of course if one was degreed by, and appointed to, some Midwestern
institution, his/her tastes are to some extent governed by geography.  To

One terrific dead writer after another, followed by living imitators.
As for power, I mentioned it merely to suggest why otherstream artists
resent academics.  The latter have the power to help the former, and
don't.

Austin:  But the latter HAVE helped the former, over and over again.  Once
again, we must consider the staying power of Stein, cummings, etc., which
owes much to the efforts of academics.  Now I'm not sure what YOUR argument
is.  Should academics not write about the dead?  The poetry, I might add, is
very much alive.  And the last I heard, most of the contemporary experimental
writers represented in the major anthologies are very much with the living.
But why should anyone single out academics in this regard?  Those on the
margins also have power to help each other out.  Some do, and some horde even
the little they have to give.  To single out Profs seems to me a little too
convenient.  In any event, you have my best wishes, always.  I'm ready to
move on to something else.  If you want the last word, it's yours.  Bill

James,

It seems I respond to your comments instinctively more than to any other
person's.
I have two issues with your comments on Herbert:

The first is to the phrase "decorative only." The "decorative" may be an
intensely intellectual experience; it has something to do with the creation
of a meditative space. In fact, my essay on decorative poetics around a
review of Ed Friedman's "Mao & Matisse" in the most recent issue of Big
Bridge (http://www.bigbridge.org/) deals exactly with that idea.

The second is your referring to Herbert's poetry as "decorative only" (this
time in your sense of decorative). I assume you are referring to "Easter
Wings." The poem, as I experience the poem, is a visual and rhythmical
incarnation of despair or the fall (as a progressively narrowing sense of
possibilities) being transformed into a progressively expanding sense of
possibilities through the Holy Ghost. That's what the wing shape is, death
and rebirth of (and in) Christ. It seems to me Hopkins's "God's Grandeur" has
"easter Wings" behind it, so does a less familiar poem, my "I hear wings in
the foliage" (with its peculiar shape), in "Io's Song."

My third point relates to the supposed "inferiority" of visual poetry. I
don't think Robert Grenier is any less imaginative than any language poets.


Murat Nemet-Nejat
 >>

Murat, your analysis is right on the money, though you don't need me to tell
you this.  However, your backchannel attributes certain statments to me that
are not in fact mine.  Austinwja@aol.com did not write the above.  Bob
Grumman wrote the above, and I replied to it.  By the way, in my reply I
never said that vp was less imaginative than lp.  I said that the innovation
of vp goes back centuries, while langpo was pretty new in our time.  Best,
Bill

Hi Richard!  Loved your post.  I promise you I have nothing against TseTse's
poetry.  Even considering Pound's brilliant edit, The Waste Land is Eliot's
poem.  And Four Quartets is no slouch either.  The history is that Eliot
pretty much ignored Williams, and that drove the latter man up a wall.  Oh,
and I also love Williams' poetry.  As I said, very democratic palette.
Always a delight to hear from you.  Hope things are going wonderfully for
you.  You deserve it.  Best, Bill

Actually, Williams was on "the road to the contagious hospital" in poem I.
of _Spring and All_.  The piece of green glass (or actually, "the broken//
pieces of a green/ bottle") is from a poem published later called "Between
Walls."

On Eliot & WCW, the notion of their opposition probably comes from Williams
himself.  Quickly thumbing through my books I have not been able to track
down the reference, but somewhere he says (disapprovingly) that "The Waste
Land" was the poem that put U.S. poetry back into the classroom.  He also
dismisses TSE as "a subtle conformist," in the famous preface to _Kora in
Hell_.

What Maria says about the frustrations of the framing in _Lingua Franca_ is right on target.  There are several subjects which seem to cause the LF editors to act like they've got a bug up the nose -- cultural studies being perhaps the most frequent instance -- and there is a certain mode of LF article we often see (and please note that I am no longer talking about Andrew's piece) -- in which reductive views of "the two sides" of a debate are presented by an author who seems to sit in some more objctive position above the silliness of the fray -- and at the same time, the mag always has some compelling reading and always has at least one piece of real news -- when they are running things like "Cannibalism: Threat or Menace? Professors Take Sides"

Most people who study visual poetry limit the term "concrete poetry" to
work coming out of the movement of that name that began in the 50s, and
for the most part concrete poets don't make "pattern poetry" or "shaped
poetry"  like Herbert's (in which the poem looks like the object it takes
as its subject matter).  So, Herbert is usually placed in the more general
category of "visual poet."

But I'm an academic, so...dare I speak at all?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Friday September 1--Tisa Bryant and Cecelia Vicuna read to a A/C buzzing,
people-packed Bluestockings Bookstore to kick off Belladonna’s Fall season.
Alicia Locker, an open reader, began the event by reciting who read a
painful/funny rhyme about her story of being an Aguna, a Jewish woman whose
hubby won’t divorce her as punishment for rejecting his violent ways—a
performance replete with non-verbal expression achieved by pointing to parts
of her body that didn’t rhyme as well with the otherwise PG rating.

San Francisco poet, former Dark Room Collective member Tisa Bryant took the
mike to read from her "Letters to Regret" series and "Tsimmes" (seems the
night had Jewish traditions written all over it). Both pieces use prose as
the base for patchwork united by time period and the consciousness of the
poet resulting in a filmic, real time, spanning camera effect. Yvonne Rainer
films thread into the quilt of "Tsimmes" (jewish compote) alongside Tituba
and slavetrade, breast cancer scare and the artifacts and language of family
history. The long piece is Bryant’s new chapbook, published by Leroy.

Cecilia Vicuña’s soft speaking voice belies a mesmerizing shamanic presence.
Exploring the communicative possibilities of the non-verbal, Vicuña’s
performance incorporated movement and wordless song—sounded without voice.
She began by moving through the crowd, rearranging objects and brushing
against audience members. This physical survey of the area transformed it
into a numinous space which Vicuña herself controlled. From this arena she
launched into a performance that was equal parts magic, humor and homage (to
prehistory, to fertility). In addition to several poems that have earned her
banned status in Latin America, her evening’s repertoire included an
impromptu dialogue with a noisy air conditioner and a duet with an angry
toddler. Interruptions which other readers might deem a nuisance Vicuña
treats as an opportunity. Her idiosyncratic take on "the show must go on"
was a welcome reminder that the show is on at all times whenever you decide
to pay attention to it.

Belladonna Books and Booglit published a pamplet of much of the work Vicuña
read during the reading, called Bloodskirt.

For the many on the Poetics List who are already heading south, either
for the Catfish Festival in Demopolis on Saturday or the Southern Miss -
Alabama football game Saturday night in Birmingham, you might wish to
hit the gas and arrive early enough to attend Johanna Drucker's lecture
this Friday afternoon.  Drucker will be speaking on "From Materiality to
Metadata: Towards a Metalogics of the Book" -- University of Alabama
(Tuscaloosa), 3 pm, 216 Phifer.  If you have car trouble and must stay
on for another couple of weeks, stick around for Kalamu Ya Salaam's
reading (7:30pm. Morgan Auditorium, Thursday, September 21) and for
Lorenzo Thomas' reading (7:30, place to be announced, Thursday,
September 28).

worth i think comparing/contrasting the academic poetry situation (whatever
you make of it) as depicted/suggested in lingua franca with a recent u.s.
news article on creative writing in academe, "labor of love," by brendan i.
koerner:

http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/beyond/grad/gbwriting.htm

(thanx to brian kenney here at cu for alerting me to this piece... seems to
this reader that the article manages to capture, perhaps unwittingly, both
the pedagogical naivete and the self-loathing of many who teach in/direct
mfa programs...)

andrew e (hi andrew) has stated hereabouts that he was less interested in
things mfa than in exploring the l=a=n=g=u=a=g=e phenom per se... i'll take
him at his word (and why not?)...

for me though (and esp. in the face of that u.s. news piece) i can't help
but dwell on the conflicted (to put it mildly) institutional circumstances
that continue to support and promote the mfa (in such & such terms) even as
controversies rage (?) over a given set of poetic practices/communities...
these are not unrelated events... but in any case it would be something of
a mistake to make the argument, at least theoretically, that teaching a
different type of literature amounts, ipso facto, to a different type of
teaching (empirically this could be so---but has anyone attempted a survey
of late?... my educated (!) guess is that "a different type of teaching"
does not correlate in overwhelmingly positive terms with a different type
of literature---but to go there, we'd really have to start talking
educational theory)...

anyway, just to notch the conversation toward less formal, more
institutionally specific considerations...

best,

A final note, for me, before I admit that we seem to be writing at
cross-purposes here. I'm not sure in what way most of what I wrote was
"outside what you were talking about," but so be it. If the argument is to
be framed in these terms, it can't progress beyond impasse. So perhaps we
should agree to disagree here? Especially when you have recourse to
something like the following, which does the ideological work of granting
your perspective the mantle of common-sense "naturalness":

My observation depends on no model of pain/pleasure, just the simple
definition that the first is what makes a person feel bad, the second
what makes a person feel good

...I'd say that's precisely a model - you could draw it with a Venn diagram,
even. Furthermore, it seems to be a particularly metaphysical sort of model,
since it ultimately depends on a seemingly alchemical process of
transubstantiation. In order to account for the experiences of those who
undeniably seek out painful/disgusting experiences for the purposes of
pleasure, it has to posit a pain that can be "converted" into pleasure, and
vice versa. Since, as you hold, they're categorical opposites, it's
difficult for me to see how this might be accomplished, short of some magic
happening in the null set that forms the intersection of the two you've
defined. Now if we were to frame it in terms of a dialectic rather than a
simple opposition, we might get somewhere. But already there, we're pretty
far from the position that could maintain categorical impermeability between
pain on the one hand and pleasure on the other. Hegel's dialectic of
lordship and bondage might do as a thumbnail sketch of some of the
subtleties involved in such situations of opposition.

Sorry for any immoderate tone in the preceding, but when my experiences and
those of people I care about get characterized as "insane," it brings out a
bit of the swamp 'gator in this Florida boy.

I snipped a lot you said about taste, Taylor, which sounds interesting
to me but outside what I believe I was talking about, which is simply
that pain is never pleasure or vice versa.  They are opposites.

To say, as you do, that it's not a matter of "defeating" disgust or
pain, but of disgust or pain being pleasure under certain concrete
conditions," seems to me insane.  Black is white under certain
conditions.  Being dead is being alive under certain conditions.
I can conceive of black being changed to white, or death to life,
but while black is black it cannot be white, nor can death be life.

So you experience a mixture of pain and pleasure.  You do not experience
pain as pleasure.

Maybe not, but I don't follow you.  By pleasure I mean that which
makes a given person feel good in some way.  It has nothing to do
with "the practices and preferences of other people."  If a
nonconformist derives pleasure from a poem that makes everyone else
vomit he is sane; if he reads that poem in hopes ONLY that it will cause
him to be sick (assuming being sick is painful for him), then he is
insane.

The difference between "getting pleasure from" and "wanting that which"
gives nothing but pain in the short term, and leads to no conceivable
plesure in the long term, is that the first is about feeling good, the
second about feeling bad.  How can it be sane to want to feel bad--
unless what caused you to feel bad will later make you feel more good
than you felt bad?

My observation depends on no model of pain/pleasure, just the simple
definition that the first is what makes a person feel bad, the second
what makes a person feel good.

Rachel,

Thanks much for the report. A minor correction for the list: Tisa's book is
published by a+bend, not Leroy. It really is a fine book, and I wouldn't
want anyone barking up the wrong tree after it.

Subject: Belladonna report

Friday September 1--Tisa Bryant and Cecelia Vicuna read to a A/C buzzing,
people-packed Bluestockings Bookstore to kick off Belladonna's Fall season.
Alicia Locker, an open reader, began the event by reciting who read a
painful/funny rhyme about her story of being an Aguna, a Jewish woman whose
hubby won't divorce her as punishment for rejecting his violent ways-a
performance replete with non-verbal expression achieved by pointing to parts
of her body that didn't rhyme as well with the otherwise PG rating.

San Francisco poet, former Dark Room Collective member Tisa Bryant took the
mike to read from her "Letters to Regret" series and "Tsimmes" (seems the
night had Jewish traditions written all over it). Both pieces use prose as
the base for patchwork united by time period and the consciousness of the
poet resulting in a filmic, real time, spanning camera effect. Yvonne Rainer
films thread into the quilt of "Tsimmes" (jewish compote) alongside Tituba
and slavetrade, breast cancer scare and the artifacts and language of family
history. The long piece is Bryant's new chapbook, published by Leroy.

Cecilia Vicuña's soft speaking voice belies a mesmerizing shamanic presence.
Exploring the communicative possibilities of the non-verbal, Vicuña's
performance incorporated movement and wordless song-sounded without voice.
She began by moving through the crowd, rearranging objects and brushing
against audience members. This physical survey of the area transformed it
into a numinous space which Vicuña herself controlled. From this arena she
launched into a performance that was equal parts magic, humor and homage (to
prehistory, to fertility). In addition to several poems that have earned her
banned status in Latin America, her evening's repertoire included an
impromptu dialogue with a noisy air conditioner and a duet with an angry
toddler. Interruptions which other readers might deem a nuisance Vicuña
treats as an opportunity. Her idiosyncratic take on "the show must go on"
was a welcome reminder that the show is on at all times whenever you decide
to pay attention to it.

Belladonna Books and Booglit published a pamplet of much of the work Vicuña
read during the reading, called Bloodskirt.

In response to question---

There's alos that Sheldon Sacks (I think that's the right name) edited book, "On
Metaphor,"
university of Chicago Press, which has some very interesting essays---a range
from more
theory-laden specialized to discourse to more "plain" speaking....

Also, Since you were interested in the difference between "metaphor" and
"metonymy,"
my hunch is that you are interested in that politicized debate that privileges
metonymy in
contemporary (is it still?) theory---

For instamce, reading a entry by Barbara Godard on Luce Irigiray, you could find

statements like this:

Irigaray " challenges [Lacan's] focus on the subject's cathexis, on the Other as
object,
                on definitions of terms rather than on relations between them;
that is, the
                privileging of metaphor and metonymy." (369)

This is interesting to me---especially the assumption that
                 metaphor is analogous to definition of terms
                and that metonymy is analogous to the relations between them.
    I do not find a necessary connection between "metaphor" and an
        over emphasis on definition of terms at the expense of the relations
between them. Sure, some metaphor theory may attempt to reduce metaphor to a
tool employed to subsume its "tenor" in its concrete "vehicle", but there are
other ways of figuring
metaphor that are at least as subversive of mere "defiinitions of terms"....

 It is not Irigaray I am critiquing here, as much as what I became aware of, in
grad school as a critical orthodoxy some of my teachers adhered to
unquestioningly--
the assumption that in order to focus on relations and constitute the other as
subject that one should employ metonymy rather than metaphor....

Anyway, this is just a thought (not going to write a whole essay now), but maybe
may be useful for your students.....

The Second Annual Best-Worst Juvenalia Contest Party

Friday September 22, 8 pm

547 Linwood Ave. Apt. 3
Buffalo


how it works: submit anonymously any number of poems: fee $1
per poem. Put each poem/journal entry/short prose piece+dollar
in a separate envelope - you may bring the entries with you to
the contest-party or mail them c/o verdure to 413 Bird Ave.,
Buffalo NY 14213 (if you can not attend the party, be sure to
include your name and address on a separate sheet).

Winner chosen by concensus on-premises.
Winner take all & publication in _verdure_.

You may submit your own juvenalia, or someone else's, but the
winner is considered to be, ultimately, the author. Submissions
of good-bad early works by well-known poets of the late 20th
century are especially encouraged.

Please be sure that your name or the author's name does not
appear on the entry, as the voting should be "blind." Obviously,
those of us who wish to disclose authorship will have the chance
to do so after the contest. Only the contest winner must come
(or be dragged) forward, though last year everyone did so.

BYOB; coffee, appetizers and desserts will be served.

"Her poems move in a homeostasis as organisms do, self regulating by
feeling, free to ascend and plummet, turn and stand. They put me in mind of
Olson=92s penetration from  "Quantity in Verse and Shakespeare's Late Plays".
They are free to move, come and go, hover as they please, like aerodynes.
The individual words are luminous with cellness=92, seeming each to know the
others, and having a way of being the whole while holding to their own gras=
p
of place.  Syntactically alarming and alerting to fresh perception, these
poems set thought to new leaps, brightly. The element of Chinese characters
and Mayan hieroglyphs dance concretely at these speeds."

What I was trying to say peevishly in my post with the too-long subject
heading was that I am much more interested in the visuality of poetry than
in visual poetry as its own separate thing.  All poetry is visual if its on
the page and/or appeals to the visual imagination.  Once you get to say that
something isn't genuine visual poetry then you are protecting turf rather
than investigating the whole problem in its full historical context.
Especially when claim are made about degrees of innovation in poetry.
Visual poetry (in the narrower sense) would have to be striking visually and
engage me linguistically as well.  Sorry to be so jaded...

Perhaps another good place to look for discussions of metaphor is in Derek
Walcott's _Omeros_, especially the middle sections where he questions his
own use of metaphor (Ancient Greece = the Caribbean).  For him empire and
metaphor seem linked, and he is both drawn to and averse (sic) to both.

Kamau Brathwaite is a much more metonymic writer, and bears comparison to
Walcott along those lines.

There are discussions of metaphor all over de Man, if I recall correctly
(it's been a while).

Gemma Fiumura Corradi has written an excellent book on metaphor (I may have
mentioned this on another list); it's published by Routledge.  This book is
also an excellent "defence of poesy."

Metaphor is understandably in trouble in a world where differences are often
considered more important than samenesses, but still has an important place
"at the table."  Hawai`i's an interesting place from which to regard
metaphor, so often misused in the interest of the colonial, too often
ignored in more recent struggles against it.

Mark--that quotation is from Williams's autobiography and begins with a
statement that Eliot's Waste Land hit the poetry world like an atom bomb (an
interesting statement, as there was no such thing in 1922!).  Williams
always struck me as very anxious about the "competition"--he really sets
Hart Crane up for abuse in _Paterson_ (metaphorically, or is it
metonymically).

Hello, everyone!

Just wanted to let you know that I am now the Lesbian Fiction Editor (I
personally call it "queer women's fiction" as this suits my politics) for
Blithe House Quarterly, which is a Gay/Lesbian online journal.  You can
check out past issues, submissions guidelines and FAQs at
http://www.blithe.com,

or jump right to http://www.blithe.com/bhq4.3/guidelines4.3.html


I'm currently reading submissions for the Winter 2000 issue.   I'm
especially looking for innovative prose, but any and all good stuff welcome.
Sorry, but no poetry, please.

I urge you to either submit previously unpublished work (if you are a queer
woman writer or have written/write about queer women), or to pass this
information on to your friends!

Check out the website first, then e-mail me if more questions arise.

Hope to hear from you!

Tisa Bryant

Okay, think very very simple model.  If it's a model, what isn't?  For

Sorry, but it's not as I hold, it's as it is.  Unless black is not

All I can say is that I can't think like you.  To me it's simple:
everyone desires pleasure, and not pain.  But some people's idea
of an object of pleasure is other people's idea of an object of pain.
No transubstatiation, just different strokes for different folks.

But you seem to be trying to say that for some people--your friends, I
guess--there could be an object which for them is an object of pain
from which they derive pleasure.  That to me is like saying there can
be an black object which is white.  If it's an object of pain, one
cannot derive pleasure from it.  If it's an object of pleasure,
it is not an object of pain.

And sure, there are subtleties involved: many objects are mixed, in
which case some people might desire them for their ability to give
pleasure in spite of their ability also to cause pain.

And that's as much as I can say about this.  (Except that its all, for
me, a matter of semantics)

Aah, I'm pretty mucu unoffendable.
And you can call me or my friends insane, I don't care--but in this
case I really doubt I call any people you care about insane because I
doubt that any of them truly desire to experience anything that gives
them pain but neither gives them pleasure at the same time directly or
indirectly or will, or they believe it will, lead them to some future
pleasure.

You're right that most people who (seriously) study the topic do as you
say, Molly, but it's a confused situation because many of them have
conflicting ideas as to what concrete poetry is, and what visual
poetry is.  There are active visual poets who do work that's not much
different from the concrete poets who hate having their work called
concrete poetry for political reasons, and because they want to think
they've gone beyond the concrete poets.  Some of them claim that
visual poetry and concrete poetry are two different poetries entirely.

There's also the (to me) idiocy of limiting the term "concrete poetry"
to a certain group of artists who worked together and did similar
work and not to others who clearly did concrete poems but whose poems
were different from those of the first group.  That is, "concrete
poetry" is on the surface an excellent general term (for poetry whose
materiality as part of paper, etc., is estheticall important), but it
has come to mean a single form of something common sense would say
exists in many other forms.  This came about because people using terms
too often apply it to a group instead of to what that group is doing,
which is the bane of taxonomy.  The concrete poets abetted this by
saying that concrete poetry was only what they and their friends did
instead of trying to be taxonomically sane--and the critics let
them get away with it.

One of the two major "concrete poetry" anthologies of c.1970, Solt's
Concrete Poetry: a World View, contains just about every form of
inanimate visual poetry I'm familiar with, including shaped poems.

The whole area's very confused, which is why I've worked out my
so-far unaccepted taxonomy of visual poetry.  I dumped the term
"concrete poetry" entirely simply because it's so vexed a term.

> But I'm an academic, so...dare I speak at all?

I'll check with my friends.  You may have redeeming qualities.

You started it, Bill. (I think.)  But don't worry, I'm running out of
gas.  So I'll be snipping and skipping in this.  Apologies, but I'm
working on--of all things--a sci fi novel that I'm trying to do 2000
words a day on, so I can't get into the various questions that have
come up in our discussion.

It's small/large in originalities I was speaking of, and I think it
should be clear: changes in subject matter and/or vocabulary are
small originalities, use of syntactical distortions never before
used for esthetic purposes is large; or finding a new rhyme scheme for
sonnets is a small originality, the first use of free verse a large
originality--etc.  Cummings was more original than Frost (which doesn't
mean he was a better poet necessarily).

A small originality can be used better than a large one, yes.

No, I AM so dismissing it--because it's a given.  Every poet has
a unique personality.

Sure.  So we go to the innovations, if any, that result, and evaluate
them, not the personalities that caused them.

You failed to answer the above.

I believe that, yes, but I was only concerned in the above with your
remark that language poetry was decidedly more innovative than visual
poetry.

Huge subject.  I think it's more that visual poetry mixes expressive
modalities, and many academics (sorry, folks) are what I call
segreceptual.  (I remember in college having to fight as an editor
of the literary magazine to get the English profs to allow the visual
art department to supply illustrations.)

Much visual poetry is short on language, but so is much poetry (haiku,
for instance).  But there is visual poetry that is full of language--
having more, in fact, than textual poetry could have since visual poets
are allowed to superimpose texts on one another.

I'm trying (not yet having begun to fight) for space ANYWHERE.

Right.

Right, but visual poetry--GENUINE visual poetry (sorry, Jonathan)--is
not just a combination of word and image, and it has not been done
that often in visual art (though there are quite a few painters and
even sculptors doing what I'd call genuine visual poetry and
getting away with it).

If you've read my piece on the taxonomy of visio-textual art at
Comprepoetica and you feel what you just said is valid, I should
junk the essay.  (URL attached)

I'm leaning toward the position that there WAS genuine visual poetry
before the 20th century but I am sure we could find language poetry
before the 20th century, too.  Langpo was definitely not something
drastically fresh in the eighties; I named all the people doing
language poetry before then, like Joyce and Stein, Cummings and Roethke.
As for pre-20th century langpo, the Greeks did the distorted syntax
thing, I'm sure--and it was as close to current langpo as what Herbert
did is to current vizpo.

Re: Frost, I didn't say his poetry was just "remixed Hardy" but that he
was an improved Hardy.  But I don't want to argue about this.  I'm
afraid I have my mind made up about Frost.  The critics favoring him
are not finding any technical innovations in his work--except little
rhymthmic finesses and the like that every poet can be found to be
doing, and every writer.

Working FOR the establishment is different from spending years to
become PART of the establishment, the way most academics have to.

No, not fiends, idiots.  Unless I'm wrong about them: but watch and
see if any of them ever bothers to demonstrate that his disregard of
visual poetry is valid--with evidence concerning the worthlessness
of such art, or even of my defenses of it.

That something is a stereotype doesn't make it false.  My overall
point is that academics could and should do a lot more for innovative
contemporary artists than they do, and that's where I'll leave this
part of our discussion.

> Incidentally, it's not "cummings," but "Cummings."

Okay, I popped off because I'm tired of him being referred to as
cummings, which I believe he didn't consider himself to be.  Your
lower case signature, which I don't think I've seen, if it wasn't
a stray joke of his, would certainly be evidence that he WAS, at
times, cummings.  I have to admit that I saw your use of the
lower-case name as further evidence of my feeling that you don't
really know visual poetry very well.

True.  I didn't say the connection I mentioned was the only one.  Very
complex situation.  I would guess most psychologists
would agree that there is such a thing as a creative personality,
and that such personalities have trouble adjusting to, say, the
army.  But I withdraw my speculation as a fact, though I strongly
believe it.  My personal reason for so doing is that my theory
of psychology, one of my life's works, says so.  But my experience
of life has confirmed it, too.

(As for me, I strongly suspect I'm way too disciplined to be a poet,
but not disciplined enough to be an academic.)

Neither am I.

Not that, nor do I see how you could get that idea.  I have said they
disregard innovative living artists.  From that it does not follow that
they should ONLY regard such artists.

A few anthologies have included a smattering of work of mostly
over-fifty-year-old language poets with connections, yes.

You read me too fast.  Where did I single out professors?  The
commercial publishers, the arts administrators running museums,
lecture circuits, grants-bestowing organizations, etc., and
others are as bad or worse.  We got into professors because
you asked why people were dumping on academics and I tried
to say why I think they do.  Which is not the same thing as
giving my own opinion of professors, which is certainly not
negative.

    Same to you.

  Good.

I took it, and would have even if I'd known in advance you were going
to offer it to me.  Too much I disagree with to let go by.

The difficulty with coming up with a working definition for visual poetry
turns on an acceptable account of its "visuality."  There's no easy way to
distinguish between a more traditional text and a visual one.  They're both
visual, even as intensely visual, if you like, as each other.

I think distinguishing between the different intensities and effects of
"visual" poetry is probably best addressed semiotically.  The best account
I've read of some of these issues is Eric Vos's Concrete Poetry as a Test
Case for a Nominalistic Semiotics of Verbal Art.

Pain-ites & Pleasure-ites,

Not sure if it's pleasurable or disgusting to see pleasure, pain and
disgust so carefully defined and interrogated--before this started I would
have said pleasurable.  I do think this thread is a good example of the
generative nature of a rather stark position strongly argued (i.e. Debrot's
original post).

However I was more interested in Debrot's attempt to justify an aesthetics
of pleasure (if that isn't too redundant) precisely because pleasure is
"potentially disruptive of the status quo."  Thus he subtly connects
pleasure back to the political/sociological which is also ground zero for
many language poets.  This dialectical response to language poetry is an
overturning that yet maintains the kernal, or perhaps one should say it
preserves the form and gives it new content--in any case it allows both an
acknowledgment of the language poets' contribution and, in theory, a
new/old possibility:  pleasure as a tool to produce social change.  In
other words, rather than asking what pleasure is, what disgust is, or what
pain is, I hear Jacques trying to lead us toward the broader question of
the uses of pleasure in a work of art, how to make it work for disruption,
and not necessarily what defines pleasure or even how to reproduce it.  As
I believe J. wrote in a post some time ago, the question for him is how to
write (which implies the question of which tools are most effective in
trying to resist and make change at the level of the
sociological/political), not why write (which implies questions of the
nature of pleasure, pain and disgust at the level of the psychological).

Maybe the foregoing does some justice to Jacques position, which I find
always stimulating if not always pleasurable.  I do recommend searching on
him in the archives for a remarkably coherent set of posts.

One part of the original post did rather displease me.  I would need much
convincing to believe that Bernstein's "recoil from the aesthetic," which
we find in J's post being "matched" to theory's critical distance,
therefore leads to both Bernstein and his newly-bedded New Historical
bedfellows turning into bureaucRATS who adjudicate the poem's *real*
meaning.  I would argue that Bernstein has never met a poem's *real*
meaning in his life--his recoil is as much from this notion of this real
meaning, which he finds completely specious, as it is from the aesthetic
itself.

However, the core of my own response and critique lies elsewhere.  Briefly,
I think there is a failure on J's part to interrogate this tool, this
pleasure-in-the-written (not just in this short post but in the others as
well), so that his view of pleasure remains always conceptual and abstract.
 This is not to say meaningless but at least meaningless outside polemical
purposes.

To concretize the concept, at least from my perspective, does require
trying to say what exactly constitutes pleasure in the experience of that
written performance.

Since Barthes seems to always be nearby in a discussion of pleasure, I will
use his essay on Fourier as my own answer and example.  The pleasure of B's
essay is the result of his ability to proceed in the service of logic,
maintaining an object (a description of Fourier's system) while also
remaining in the service of his own zone of obsessions and idiosyncracies
(transgression, invention, of course language above all). If we have the
first without the second, we have no pleasure since we ought to read
Fourier directly.  If we have the second without the first, we have no
pleasure but only the claustrophobia of an immersion in another's
self-obsession.  While B's essay might not please everyone, I suspect it
produces displeasure when the reader finds the object slipping into the
obsession, or the obsession disappearing in the object.

I believe I could find a similar object/obsession tension in Fourier
himself, which might explain why he is still being read, nut that he is.

In short, in my view it is the working out of this *method* of art which
makes pleasure into something actual.  If so, therefore pleasure cannot
then become the method of art in the way J. argues it should (i.e. cannot
then be placed in the poem in order to make social change)--pleasure is a
product of a particular and apriori interchange, not a tool.


To approach it from a different direction, I would say that in order for
Barthes' essay to be pleasurable, Barthes himself had to read Fourier
critically, with distance, dispassion--he could not simply experience
pleasure, succumb to it.  The root of academic distance (which divorced of
obsession is what J. calls the Puritan) lies here, actually stolen from art
I would assert.

Barthes begins by knowing his own obsessions--these are the initial
objects, which when obscured from him or anyone become, in my view, again
the first pursuit.  I think pleasure must be understood as rooted in this
fundamentally domestic (to steal a term from Fourier) space--here it finds
and returns to itself.  The political might become its object, just as
Fourier's system might become Barthes' object, but it needn't--what is
necessary is the obsession, some grasp of the immediate economy, and then
*any* object that those obsessions can work against and within.

Some may object that the domestic, however it is defined, necessarily
extends from the political, from that more Marxist economy.  But instead of
that argument (which I too find compelling) I prefer to try to concretize
this "domestic"--what I want is to be understood, that is my object, even
while the idiosyncrasies of that conveyance are in many ways more primary
to me.

It isn't difficult to imagine a person who experiences a deadness around
them, or a deadness in themselves, where extremely real decisions they have
made have isolated them from pleasure--for instance there are people
brought back to life and pleasure by a particular dance performance, by
meeting someone, or more often by a slight shift in the way they conceive
their own power and potential.

For myself, I feel it is only recently that I begin to understand the full
weight of being a participant in my own life, that I could be capable of
storming out of a room (for instance) or otherwise responding to events as
something other than an extension of my upbringing.  The terror,
frustration and sometimes pleasure of this so-called freedom takes place,
as I experience it, in a space I can only understand as domestic.  It may
become a political economy by induction, or it may also become a politics
once its prior obsessions are grasped, but it still presents itself as a
drama of appalling immediacy.

I'm half-thinking of Truffaut's 400 Blows as I write this, where in the
very first scene a picture of a woman is being passed around the classroom
and 14-year-old Antoine stops to draw a moustache or something on her--that
is, he tries to participate rather than merely gazing, and this one act
begins the long and subtle (i.e. obsessed, idiosyncratic) chain of events
that lead him to juvenile detention.  Throughout, the social system
punishes his continual attempts to not simply receive wisdom.

I do wonder if this matter of participation and (egad) empowerment, which I
see in the attempt to maintain the idea of a root domestic space and the
idiosyncrasies therein, is not identical to the political power of pleasure
which J. describes.  But based on some of his other posts I would maintain
that J. has the reversed sense of things.  Maybe this would become clear in
a discussion of the new in art.  Cliched or redundant art seems loathsome
to me not primarily because it fails to disrupt a social status quo but,
first of all, because it causes me to fear that what I recognize as cliches
are no longer recognized by anyone else, i.e. that I have lost all contact
with other intelligences.  Although I can imagine and have read many
fascinating critiques of this general position as essentialist, romantic,
psychological, bourgeois, humanist, etc., it means very little next to that
actual fear, which I think, on the contrary, is the most stable ground on
which to build the new, subversive and anti-bourgeois in art.  Besides, as
I said, until this fear has an object it's just boring self-obsession.

Sorry this went on so long.  Probably should have saved it for an essay.

************************************
A Paper Mephisto: The New Orleans School for the Imagination

A NEW POETRY is in the making. And just like
the possibility of life based on silicon, it's here to
stay. But before everyone can congratulate New
Orleans on becoming the new center of the universe
for the Imaginary, let me mention a few things. First
of all, unlike its spiritual neighbor and counterpart,
Catholicism, there was no virgin birth or immaculate
conception. The Imaginary has many suitors. Nor
are we at pains to demonstrate otherwise, i.e. "Jesus"
begets "Hey Zeus." You see, when one is imaginary,
one may well suffer from insomnia, but hardly from
sleeplessness. Or that is to say, those who cannot
remember the future are condemned to repeat it.
Besides, looking back through the looking-glass at
the twentieth century and all its impossible hells is
no longer meaningful. It is merely sentimental (much
like Ike & Tina or dead Eva Peron moaning inverted
teardrops). Throw yourself a bone for chrissakes!
Sing your mind into skew! Let's have fun at everything:
Cotillion Balls! Ancestral Compost! Strobe-a-phobia!
Menu Pounding Spoons! It's such easy feet and more
in the world than shipwrecked bath toes! Not to mention
being adult is like having a bad trip, and therefore,
a not-so-complicated double-joke! Particularly so,
as Poet Bernadette Mayer points out, for "merger"
and "acquisition" types. Indeed, revisionist experts
have bankrolled our idea of "The Land of the Free"
into "America the Inimical!" It's a sinister three stooges
orgy of what Lewis, Clark & Co. would have found
if they were born tomorrow. Hence, as was prophesied
by Poet Ted Berrigan: "Baffling combustions are
everywhere downriver." This whorling primordial goo
consists of creosote tomatoes, busted concrete,
and palmetto bugs (that souvenir of Native Night and
Big Muddy), and is belching up from fleshpots even
as I write. In fact, this summer, at a secret location in
the Undercity, and incubating at record-high temperatures,
two secret brains gave birth to a many-headed pigeon.
This fantastic creature will serve as mascot for all said
"Imaginary" endeavors. It's function is to induce people
into a good nap, and hereafter, pardon the soul like
a broken church bell on Sunday afternoons. Brace
yourself for psychological impact. This is a Poetry of
Collisions, a Language Crystal of sorts, where all hours
and futures float your head by the ankles and spin your
mind into suspended animation orbit. Yes, this highly
unhypothetical event is imminent! On September 25th,
in the year of the triple zero, "The New Orleans School
for the Imagination" begins its inaugural season. Emeritus
Confessor of Abomination, Dave Brinks, is its bi-spiritual
founder. And while his unsoundness of mind can't be
helped, help yourself. Greet the day with wide drowsy
yawns! Whisper with all tender rage your one great calm!
Tie snake rattles to the ends of your long black braids
and mercilessly compose Imaginary Poetry! The corsets
of happiness are begging to be opened!

MORE ON GOLDSMITH:

Kenneth Goldsmith took a BFA in sculpture, is a visual artist of great
range, publishes as an innovative poet whose book Fidget "gives engagement
a whole new dimension,"* and has created and continually edits what is by
far the most comprehensive web site of visual, concrete nd sound poetery
(UbuWeb). (His essay, "Ubuweb Wants to Be Free," is linked here.)

Among Goldsmith's books and compact discs include Tizzy Boost, a
collaboration with Bruce Andrews (1993); 73 Poems, published by Permanent
Press (Brooklyn, NY, 1994) with essays by Robert Mahoney, John Schaefer,
and Geoffrey Young; No. 111 2.7.96-19.20.96 (The Figures, 1997); and Fidget
(Coach House Books, 2000).

Fidget is Goldsmith's transcription of every movement made by his body
during thirteen hours on Bloomsday (June 16), 1997. Originally commissioned
by the Whitney Museum of American Art as a collaboration with vocalist Theo
Bleckmann, Fidget attempts to reduce the body to a catalogue of mechnical
movements by a strict act of observation. The online edition of Fidget at
www.chbooks.com includes the full text, a self-running Java applet version
written by programmer Clem Paulsen, and a selection of RealAudio recordings
from Theo Bleckmann's vocal/visual performance at the Whitney on Bloomsday,
1998.

* Of No. 111 2.7.96-19.20.96, Marjorie Perloff has written: it "is an
encyclopedic poem based on words ending in the sound ah, a collection of
words drawn from conversation, books, phone calls, radio shows, newspapers,
television and especially the internet, arranged alphabetically and by
syllable count so as to create a Gargantuan poetic reference book or
archive of the argot of our times."

Subject:      Atelos announces the publication of R-hu by Leslie Scalapino
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

R-hu
by Leslie Scalapino

    Atelos is pleased to announce the publication on September 1, 2000 of
R-hu by Leslie Scalapino.


About the book:
    R-hu was begun as an experiment in anticipation of a journey to China and
Mongolia undertaken by Leslie Scalapino, and much of the writing of the book
was accomplished in those places. The r-hu of the title is a Mongolian
stringed instrument (the English spelling is phonetic: "She made the shape of
letters in the air and said 'R-hu.' It's not possible to be lost."). Using
narrative, dream, memory, literary criticism, and argument, the writing
crosses successive horizons. The process constitutes a meditation on the
emergence of forms; the result is a myriad of encounters with those forms
which are the shapes of inner and outer experience; Scalapino sees the inner
and outer as simultaneous, interlocked. But they are also entirely separate;
we experience their conjunction and interdependence, but we must view these
as astonishing and bound to no logical (or social) hierarchies. Ultimately,
R-hu is a book about freedom. It is an action in and of freedom.

About the author:
    Leslie Scalapino was born in Santa Barbara, California, and grew up in
Berkeley. She attended Reed College and graduate school at the University of
California-Berkeley. She teaches at Bard College in the Milton Avery Graduate
Program of the Arts and at the San Francisco Art Institute. She has also
taught at Mills College, the Naropa Institute, and elsewhere. Leslie
Scalapino is the author if eighteen books of poetry, fiction, plays, and
essays, the most recent of which are New Time and The Public
World/Syntactically Impermanence (both published by Wesleyan University
Press).

About the project:
    Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of Hip's Road. It is devoted to
publishing, under the sign of poetry, writing which challenges the
conventional definitions of poetry, since such definitions have tended to
isolate poetry from intellectual life, arrest its development, and curtail
its impact. All the works published as part of the Atelos project are
commissioned specifically for it, and each is involved in some way with
crossing traditional genre boundaries, including, for example, those that
would separate theory from practice, poetry from prose, essay from drama, the
visual image from the verbal, the literary from the non-literary, and so
forth. The Atelos project when complete will consist of 50 volumes;
R-hu is volume 6. The project directors and editors are Lyn Hejinian and
Travis Ortiz; cover production and design is by Ree Hall.


Ordering information:
    R-hu may be ordered from Small Press Distribution, 1341 Seventh Street,

Dear Friends of POG:

This is POG’s fifth season of public arts programming.  Over the years we
have brought to Tucson (or co-sponsored) such important writers as Bob
Perelman, David Bromige, Leslie Scalapino, Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge, Jerry
Rothenberg, Clayton Eshleman, Lydia Davis, Michael Davidson, Erica Hunt,
Juan Felipe Herrera, Norman Fischer, Dodie Bellamy, Kevin Killian, Rae
Armantrout, David Shapiro, Bernadette Mayer, Juliana Spahr, Bill Luoma, Gil
Ott, Maggie Jaffe, and Lyn Hejinian.  And we have presented—typically on the
same program with such visiting writers—Arizona writers, musicians, dancers,
and visual artists such as Jim Waid, Cynthia Miller, Victor Masayesva, A.C.
Huerta, Alex Garza, Ned Schaper, Nancy Solomon, Barbara Penn, Maurice
Grossman, Danny Lopez, the Ge Oidag Village (Big Fields) Traditional
Dancers, Anne Bunker, Barbara Cully, and Gwen Ray.  Both the range of
writers and artists we present and our commitment to cross-over arts
programming make POG an important presence on the Tucson arts scene.  Our
2000-2001 season, a schedule for which you received recently  on email,
continues this programming tradition.

For this 2000-2001 season POG’s programming expenses are roughly $7,000.
Approximately $1,500 of this is covered by grants from the Arizona
Commission on the Arts and the Tucson/Pima Arts Counil.  The remaining
$5,500 needs to be raised through event admissions, our annual fundraising
dinner, sale of POG-related books and broadsides, and (to a significant
extent) individual and corporate contributions.

We ask that you consider one of the following ways of supporting POG this
year:

·       purchasing a Season Subscription: $30.  Free admission to all Fall 2000
and Spring 2001 POG events (a savings of $15 over regular admission to all
nine scheduled events).

·       becoming a POG Sponsor: $50.  For a contribution of $50 or more, you can
become a POG Sponsor.  In exchange you receive a Season Subscription (value
$30) and any one of the following: a copy of the POG ONE anthology; a copy
of the POG TWO anthology (forthcoming spring 2001); or a POG t-shirt.  (Each
of these is a $10 value.)

·       becoming a POG Patron: $100.  For a contribution of $100 or more you can
become a POG Patron.  In exchange you receive a Season Subscription (a $30
value) and TWO of the following: POG ONE, POG TWO, POG t-shirt (a $20
value).

POG is an IRS recognized 501(c)3 non-profit corporation.  All contributions
are fully tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.

If you’d like to purchase a Season Subscription or become a POG Sponsor or
POG Patron, you can simply respond to this email, explaining briefly which
category you’d like to be in.  If you are becoming a Sponsor or Patron,
please also let us know whether you’d like your name listed along with other
POG donors in our publicity (we hope you’ll let us use your name).  Then
mail your check, made out to POG, to: POG, 7931 East Presidio Road, Tucson,
AZ  85750.

We’ll add you to our in-house list of Subscribers, Sponsors, and Patrons;
just mention your name at the door and you’ll be admitted free of charge to
all POG events.  If you are becoming a Sponsor or Patron, you can claim your
free gift(s) at any POG event.

(If you do respond by email, be sure your response is being directed to
nathanso@u.arizona.edu or Tenney@azstarnet.com [depending on which section
of our email list you are on, your email software might try to send your
response to a listserv address]).

If you prefer, you can instead print out the form which will come to you
momentarily in a separate email message; send it, along with your check, to
the address listed above.

Thank you for your interest in POG programming.

Sincerely,

Tenney Nathanson
President, POG Board of Directors

Ron. Thanks for this and the link to the N.Y Times which is difficult to get
here (or tedious to get at).I found a link on it to some old loner artist
they've "discovered" with a strange obsession for young children. But it was
very interesting.
  The business man says some quite cogent things. He was wrong about the
nuclear thing though.. The book: "the Making of the Atomic Bomb" by Richard
Rhodes is an excellent book and covers this.(Rhodes won a Pulitzer). From
memory I think Fermi experimented with bringing uranium close to critical
mass then they put the carbon rods back into the pile(which I think was in
the middle of Chicago!). There was some danger but no dangerous radiation or
"blast" occurred. Nor was Fermi playing a game. Anyway its a strange example
for the guy to give!
  The obvious point is that it is how one thinks in relation to where or in
what manner one is employed. Its not impossible for a multi millionnaire to
be "left" sympathetic. A lot of("high" level business people or ground-floor
workers)are so involved in the daily grind that they cant see how they
themselves are directly involved. Charles Ives (I just been able  to hear
his music relat. recently) was another example). he felt (sincerely I
think)that insurance was of great importance for people.He was a
multi-millionaire. None of us are "free" of "bourgeois" influence. It's
maybe a bit more problematic when  eg ABDOTWW (Auckland New Zealand)
publishes Leigh Davis who has publically declared his great enthusiasm for
capitalism. This then draws attention to his writing and its theoretical
basis. He may be justified in "loving" capitalism - after all we all benefit
from certain aspects of it (mass production,cheap food,medicine) even if
some of these might be theoretically even of greater general benefit in some
more egalitarian or "socialistic" society. I think people on the list, who
have the time, would find ABDOTWW (latest issue from Auckland features the
very talented poet Alan Loney), and there has and is still some vital things
there, but the Writers Group have still not adressed (sufficiently) certain
questions raised in an earlier issue (No 14 1999) raised by Scott Hamilton.
Perhaps there were inconsistencies in Scott's "attack" but the issues
raised, or arising - such as the question of the interaction of poetics and
ultimately politics - have been left (somewhat) in limbo. Geraets doesnt
seem to see the urgency of the political questions that are raised by Scott.
Or perhaps the problem is timidity or apathy by other contributers. By not
engaging in some debate the "Poetic Left" leaves itself open to the kind of
charges that are made by McClatchy and others of his ilk. Nor do I think
that everyone who is say "avant-garde" in their poetics, would or should
(not a good word) support say Marxist or(alternatively say) some variant of
Idealist philosophy. But too many magazines seem to not even attempt to
tackle these questions. I want to read the Lingua Franca thing for myself
(I'm getting it, I hope) but it seems that there may be parallels with the
"accusations" made against you (andCharles Bernstein?)and what Scott
Hamilton called "The Leigh Davis Paradox". Anyway, that's my pennyworth for
now.Regards, Richard.

Mark. That's right.I "done a mistake". I think he's referring specifically
to "La  Figlia che Piange" and a weakness in that poem. It might be a
simplification to say: but I think Williams (eg in that magnificant poem 1
in Spring and All for eg.) turns his eye brightly out and finds an
extraordinary world there. Eliot is always, or seems to have been always,
brooding (a bit like Geoffrey Hill) inwardly but unfortunately found nothing
happy there.Perhaps "happy" isn't the right term for either poet, and Eliot
doesnt seem to have ever been happy.Maybe he saw ecstatic and "religious" or
"epiphanic" glimpses of The Truth (whatever that is).Perhaps in diferent
ways, all poets struggle toward the same 'big' questions.Or why write? Eliot
is operating from the heights of an established theory - an almost medieval
view of the world. Williams seems to be struggling to get away from such
hierarchical "theories" and is struggling with - the mystery? Of
consciousness, and Nature (here he links with the Romantics eg Coleridge).I
think Williams was the more radical,but, there were, (perhaps there are with
many writers who in many  other ways have major divergences)points of near
intersection. Perhaps Williams is more of an innovator in the formal
sense:Maybe eg in Spring and All in the way his whole work becomes a kind of
Poessay (a term invented by Scott Hamilton).In a different way Robert Lowell
mixed prose pieces with poetry in Life Studies.People constantly find it
"clever" to mock Williams (Wheelbarrow and Plums in the fridge poems). But
how many could come so close to such power from such economy? Richard.

Lakoff and Johnson 1980, _Metaphors We Live By_ redefines metaphor as a
cognitive process rather than a 'figure of speech.' Lakoff and Turner
1989, _More Than Cool Reason_ shows how this redefinition can impact our
understanding of texts.  Both books provide redefinitions of metonymy
along the same lines, and both are quite accessible.

JACK Magazine, edited by Mary Sands and Michael Rothenberg, is an offshoot
of Beat Generation News (www.beatnews.org) and an arc to the Big Bridge
(www.bigbridge.org). It's where the parameters of the Beat Generation are
redefined and expanded to embrace a creative movement that goes beyond
personality wedged in temporal categories and public relations concepts.
JACK will ponder emanations and movements in modern literature and art that
have been operating and vital since before the turn of the 20th century but
eclipsed by the "Beat movement," such as Post-Apocalyptic Romanticism,
Psychedelic Shamanism, Church of Latter Day Surrealism, Cannabis Mumbo
Gumbo, Burroughsian Anti-Utopianism, San Francisco Renaissance Poetry,
Modern Urban Thoreauism and Forest Beatnikism, Black Mountain Poetry, and
Language School Poetry-all creative phenomenon that inform, as well as are
informed by, what is popularly know as "Beat."

Note: This mailing goes out 3x a year. If you'd rather not receive further
notices of JACK, let us know.

Eminent experimental writer CLARK COOLIDGE was raised in Providence, Rhode
Island, and lived for many years in western Massachussetts. He has been
writing poetry since the 1950's and is considered an essential link between
the countercultural poetry of the late 50's and early 60's and the Language
Writing movement of today. He is the author of numerous collections
including Odes of Roba, The Crystal Text, The Book of During, and Own Face.
Aside from working with Keith Waldrop, he has also collaborated with the
artist Phillip Guston. Coolidge currently lives and works in Petaluma,
California.

About Clark Coolidge/Kieth Waldrop's  BOMB (July 2000)

A landmark first-time collaboration between poet Clark Coolidge and
writer/scholar/artist Keith Waldrop, Bomb is a meditation on a book of
photographs that document the Manhattan Project. Coolidge's thirty-page
poem begins with epigraphs by Democritus, Gregory Corso and Andre
Breton/Paul Eluard, and continues in an elliptical, glancing narrative
style that lucidly investigates a subject often too traumatic to consider
directly-the impact of the atomic bomb on our lives. Or should we say
instead, the bomb's impact on our everyday lives-as Coolidge puts it, the
general tendency has been to "put the bomb in a glass vase/add dust and
forget." Like all of Coolidge's work, Bomb is sharp, stark, and rhythmic;
the poet here tangles with the dreamlike oddness of the photographs at hand
in fits and starts of language with an explosive beauty. Keith Waldrop's
series of collages are literal reworkings of the original pictures: deep
blacks and bright whites excavated from the book, remade here in the image
of the poem.


MICHAEL GIZZI was born in Schenectady, New York. He received his BA and MFA
from Brown University where he studied with Keith Waldrop. Subsequently, he
was associated with the circle of poets centered around Keith and Rosmarie
Waldrop's Burning Deck Press. For seven years he worked as a tree surgeon
in southeastern New England, before moving in the early 80's to the
Berkshire Hills where he collaborated on several Kerouac-inspired projects
with Clark Coolidge. For many years he organized a series of poetry
readings at Melville's Arrowhead and Simon's Rock of Bard College. Most
recently he has edited the Profile Series for Hard Press in West
Stockbridge. He lives in Lenox and is married to the artist Barbieo
Barros-Gizzi.

Critical praise for Michael Gizzi's NO BOTH (Lingo, 1998)

Through the mad clutter of everyday life the poet's voice speeds along and
isn't going to let you off the hook till the end of the poem, if then.
Razor sharp but also rich and generously compelling, Michael Gizzi's poetry
lambastes as it celebrates, bringing us finally to a place of poignant
irresolution where "This music that for the moment/Takes on the work of
youth" is "Held for life in fluttering devastation."
- John Ashbery

Cross James Joyce and Jack Nicholson in a high energy construct machine and
you have Michael Gizzi's poems. He will tell you everything you knew was
true but didn't have the guts to say. Physiologically, psychologically,and
geographically, Gizzi locates the voices of us, Olson's "last first
people," with an element of quick surprise that is all his own.
- Lisa Jarnot

In the hyperbolic vernacular of the barroom confessional, Michael Gizzi
delivers a full bag of urgent messages, their sources detached from the
old, weird America of a not-so-distant past. Impossibly rich, these
jam-packed audibles are spring-loaded to jack-knife off the page. No Both
is word jazz, coiled, mortal and alive.
- Kit Robinson

Words are haunted by, for instance, meaning.

The first section of this book proposes, on a disproportionate scale,
assuming (with Whitehead) that "the primary function of a proposition is to
be relevant as a lure for feeling." Words here are decoys, hoping to entice
the real thing within range.

The second section is elegiac; the past haunts what language hopes to posit
about itself. Propositions retreat and burrow pure sense beneath the level
at which song turns language away from the world's edge and back towards
what words possess.

The third tries -- skeptically-- to follow certain words to their own
haunts, where meaning is intermittently glimpsed as feeling. "Skeptic" in
the sense of unbridled, disciplined thought that follows meaning along the
patient path of the repaginated past.

Here's that amazing Williams passage in full, Marc, from the
Autobiography:

        "Then out of the blue The Dial brought out the Waste Land and all
our hilarity ended.  It wiped out our world as if an atom bomb had been
dropped on it and our brave sallies into the unknown were turned to dust.
        "To me especially it struck like a sardonic bullet.  I felt at
once that it had set me back twenty years, and I'm sure it did.
Critically Eliot returned us to the classroom just at the moment when I
felt that we were at the point of an escape to matters much closer to the
essence of a new art form itself--rooted in the locality which should give
it fruit.  I knew at once that in certain ways I was most defeated.
        "Eliot had turned his back on the possiblity of reviving my world.
And being an accomplished craftsman, better skilled in some ways than I
could ever hope to be, I had to watch him carry my world off with him, the
fool, to the enemy."

Taylor,
Thanks for finding my horrible mistake. I hate mistakes!  OF COURSE--A
BEAUTIFUL a+bend book called TSIMMES by Tisa Bryant covered by a wonderful
archival photograph of an ancestral member of the family.  To buy this book
find Jill Stengal at Jilith@aol.com.  A mere $5.00.

Bryant's Leroy book will be out some time in the future.

Joseph. Maybe its like Shakespear's works. They wern't actually written by
him, but by some other joker with the same name. Mind you he (W.S.) spelt
his name in quite a number of different ways.Perhaps Zubukoffski was
actually Shakespear reincarnated? Or was he just invented by someone? Did he
exist? The difference between all these "great" poets and me is that I'm
alive. Fuck them, what did they ever do for me? Eh? Richard.

Subject:      Pain/pleasure (was Re: LangPo, academia, politics)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

For what it's worth, I think I'm clear on what the cross-purposes in this
debate are.

Bob G. is talking in definitional terms -- "pleasure = this, pain = that"
-- so that disagreeing can plausibly seem as "insane" to him as disagreeing
with a tautology or a mathematical equation. He says he's not relying on
any model of pain/pleasure, because he is trying to make a formal,
content-independent point (or rather, he is positing a logical structure,
not make factual claims within that structure). Cf.

>pain is never pleasure or vice versa.  They are opposites.

or

>I can conceive of black being changed to white, or death to life,
>but while black is black it cannot be white, nor can death be life.

These are not literal content claims (what about vampires?), but logical
claims.

Taylor B., in constrast, is working from common-sense everyday definitions
and then pushing against them. (His term for this: "dialectic.") When he
says something like

>In order to account for the experiences of those who
>undeniably seek out painful/disgusting experiences for the purposes of
>pleasure, it [Bob G.'s view] has to posit a pain that can be "converted"
>into pleasure, and
>vice versa. Since, as you hold, they're categorical opposites, it's
>difficult for me to see how this might be accomplished, short of some magic

, he is taking for granted that we "know" what
"undeniably...painful/disgusting experiences are" (self-mutilation, eating
shit, whatever), and also that we more or less know what "the purposes of
pleasure" are, and then he is advocating that we rethink those
understandings.

He is advocating that for explicitly political/activist reasons (he wants
people who do certain things not to be seen as "sick" or insane), whereas
Bob G. is avowing a purely taxonomic perspective (he wants people to CALL
whatever someone enjoys "pleasureable (to them)"). I think Taylor B. either
[a] suspects Bob G. of smuggling some content into his supposedly logical
point (i.e., claiming to make a definitional point but tacitly excluding
certain practices from what can logically be considered "pleasure"), or [b]
fears that others will smuggle in those same content biases and have a
purportedly "logical, obvious, natural" proof of those biases, a proof
which runs as follows:

since "whatever anyone enjoys = pleasureable" (Bob G.'s point)

and "self-mutilation etc. is painful, since it hurts" (the smuggled content),

therefore "no-one (except sick/insane unspeakables) can enjoy
self-mutilation" (the conclusion that's politically unacceptable to Taylor
B.)



So now is everybody pleasured? Painfully pedantic clarity like totally
turns me on....

Taylor B.:

>A final note, for me, before I admit that we seem to be writing at
>cross-purposes here. I'm not sure in what way most of what I wrote was
>"outside what you were talking about," but so be it. If the argument is to

>should agree to disagree here? Especially when you have recourse to

>your perspective the mantle of common-sense "naturalness":
>
>>My observation depends on no model of pain/pleasure, just the simple

>>what makes a person feel good
>
>...I'd say that's precisely a model - you could draw it with a Venn diagram,
>even. Furthermore, it seems to be a particularly metaphysical sort of model,
>since it ultimately depends on a seemingly alchemical process of
>transubstantiation. In order to account for the experiences of those who

>vice versa. Since, as you hold, they're categorical opposites, it's
>difficult for me to see how this might be accomplished, short of some magic

>far from the position that could maintain categorical impermeability between
>pain on the one hand and pleasure on the other. Hegel's dialectic of
>lordship and bondage might do as a thumbnail sketch of some of the
>subtleties involved in such situations of opposition.
>
>Sorry for any immoderate tone in the preceding, but when my experiences and

>bit of the swamp 'gator in this Florida boy.

living digital

my aunt was dead in ohio
and it was raining like hell
so
the family couldn't take a flight
so
the relatives sent us a
videocassette tape
in digital
with complete date:time
so
we wouldnt miss any of the action
so
we popped in the tape
the tv sparked on
my father farted
my sister giggled
the dog barked
and we bowed our heads
as god appeared through the static





a girl named layla

from texas
said she read my work
online
and
"he is someone i would like to talk to"

yes

that
is
well
and
good

but
who would I like to talk to???







one minute of my time

11:37

fix hair
in tv reflection

find ginger
mostly attractive

hate skipper
irresistable queer

worry about
poem shelf life

dislike smell
of rusty hymnal

enjoy piss
smell in book

being silent
allie beautiful

reorganize
teenage wallet

reasses me
in visa card

in the pocket

remote control cock

yawn over
dylan's bob

type people
are computers are people

need to love
fyodor book

kiss pages
feeling slut

get praise
hold it limp

and insecure

want john
to like it best

give critic
open fly

start now
to bore me far

11:38.









how to think like an artist:

today i will do something drastic

like...

shave my head
or pretend i can't cope without pot

maybe you will find me smoking a pack a day
writing poetry on parking meters
(like i saw some brilliant guy do)

i guess i could do
a painting that really makes no sense

because perhaps,
to you,
it'll be some metaphor
for sex

poets are notorious for losing their girlfriends
losing friends easily
losing weight easily

men in wheelchairs always get the worst kind of sympathy

the Catholic church puts up abortion banners on Main Street
the Christian Scientists' tend to spring flowers

speeding tickets are easy
murders are quickly forgotten:
except for on the anniversary because it is easy for reporters
to ask turned-red red-turned questions to the mother:
"how do you feel one year later?"
"how do you think the town has changed, two years later?"

the library has all the decent Beat books, and Rimbaud too

everyone is getting their own email account, yet
over
shrimp cocktail
fritos
sour-cream dip
light beer and
remote control conquest,
we all have decided unanimously that dot-com is out of control
I am the white buzz of conversation.

Thank god they sell rolling papers in town
but where is the loose tobacco?

No one cares about the 2000 elections, yet everyone will vote
everyone cares about the schoolboard elections
but the candidates are ghosts

praise for the private schools where the girls don't give blowjobs
praise for two squirrels, making love in the backyard
praise for red-stained mouths of snow cone babies
praise for the robber that took our cd's and the Wright's television

all the detectives know that the robber was definitely black
and the children in the house dreamt of a nigger with a knife

a fairytale that i believe has no immediate point

the father
sits in an office room

curled up
with a picture

while
the daughter
closes her ears
prying,
trying to forget
the memory
of her mother on the phone,
saying, "he was the best fuck of my life"

Hmmm . . . .  I don't think metaphor is in trouble, not at all.  It
ostensibly compares, but all comparisons are in truth the marking of
differences.  I have at least considered the possibility that metonymy is a
metaphor.  Best, Bill

I believe Williams said that Eliot's poetry set literature back 50 years.

Yo Damion,

Way to go, disclosing my agenda for all and sundry to see. But seriously,
yes, you do a good job breaking it down, and it's a caution to my own
rhetoric to note that this forefronting of the argument in terms of its own
motivating "stakes" had to come from a third party. So thanks.

Circumspectly yours,
Taylor

Just wanted to put in a plug for the Bhanu Kapil Rider book. Despite the
weight of a title that might have the Donna Haraway-acquainted among you
assuming you've heard this one before -- trust me, you haven't.

There is the poem by William Bronk "Metonymy As an Approach to a Real World,"
found in his Life Supports (Talisman).

There is also his essay, "Costume As Metaphor", to be found in The Collected
Essays of William Bronk, Vectors and Smoothable Curves (new edition)
(Talisman)

Much of Bronk's work was concerned with these themes. The most committed
discussion I've seen on these -- and Bronk's work in general -- is to be
found in The Winter MInd: William Bronk and American Letters, by Burt
Kimmelman (Fairleigh Dickinson University Press).

        at the risk of sounding (or being) cyncial--
        i thnk that the whole issue of pleasure/disgust/pain is really
        related to the creation of ever new markets, demographics, target
        audiences

        in short in a free market capitalist system, anything is welcome
        in that it may be turned into a money making propostion
        the "trangsressive", "alternative' is quickly co opted
        just as is the pleasurable and painful

        in each case, the various modalities are marketed as "tests"
        of one's endurance--of pleasure, of pain, of disgust

        it is interesting to note that a number of the test cases so to
        speak--the work of Mapplethorpe or Cindy Sherman or Barbara Kruger
        etc
        are all "transgressive" in content only--that is, the reframing of
        already familiar, status quo imagery

        they are basicaly "classical" works, using classical models
        and so are easily recongized in their turn as that wonderfully
        oxymoronic entty, the "instant classic"

        Magritte made a statement to the effect that the one real
        accomplishment of surrealism was in the changing modes of
        advertisement

        one of the questions regarding visual poetry in this discussion is
        that all written  poetry is visual--because we see/read it

        this blithely sidesteps the question posed by much visual poetry:
        can one learn to think in wordless ways?

Good grief, yes, Bob Grenier.  My brain really is going.  But there IS
a Bob Gregory, who is an excellent visual poet--and for all I know
does language poetry, too.  There are just too many Bob Gr--'s
around!

Sorry, Ward, but this has to be the silliest thing I ever read about
visual poetry.  Textual (or traditional) poetry has to be seen to be
read, but it is not visual in any consequential sense, only verbal.
Visual poetry differs from it inasmuch as its NONVERBAL visual elements
are as aesthetically important as its verbal elements.  Take away its
visual elements and it becomes aesthetically null, or close to it--
but it remains readable.  You might say it is visible but not visual.

of course one can at least think in non-verbal ways (not sure about the
learning part tho).  one example...mathematical thinking...those of you who
have studied electromagnetism or advanced calculus will have found
yourselves thinking through non-verbal representations at times.  though i
don't quite know if such thinking is learned or innate; both, I would
presume.

I lost track of who originally wrote:

"a poet working in the verbal

AND the visual would have to be more innovative, other > >things being
equal, to a poet working in the verbal alone"


But there is no such thing as "other things being equal."  The idea here
seems to be that innovation might be a quantitative measure.  Thus poet A,
who confines his/her innovations to non-visualizable language, will
automatically be less innovative than poet B, whose innovations extend to
the visual layout of the text, assuming that B is somehow = equal = in
other respects. It sounds logical enough, but does it obtain in the real
world?  Is Donne less innovative that Herbert?  Is cummings more
innovative than WCW? It seems to me that a qualitative judgment must also
be made, otherwise we'd be forced into some counterintuitive conclusions.
Even when it's the same writer who produces a visual text and another
*non*visual poem. There is nothing to predict, a priori, that the first
will be more innovative than the second. This is to be decided
inductively, after the fact, not as some sort of spurious deductive
principle.

_____________________
PARIS, June 16 (AFP) =97 Lovers of French literature are shedding tears of
despair at the news that a cultural centre in the Yemeni city of Aden
named after Arthur Rimbaud -- poet -- has been turned into a hotel named
after John Rambo -- Hollywood war-hero.
The three-story house, where the poet himself stayed in the 1880s,
was inaugurated as the Maison de Rimbaud in 1994, but three years later
lack of French government funding forced it to close down.
On a recent visit to Aden, Rimbaud-enthusiast Jose-Marie Bel was
shocked to find that a building that once spread the beauties of Gallic
civilisation was now dedicated to the epitome of American machismo.
=91=91There is a big sign outside saying Hotel Rambo,=92=92 said Bel, who as
former head of the association Friends of Rimbaud was responsible for the
original renovation of the house.
=91=91It is scandalous. It is inadmissible. It is a dishonour to France
and it is a dishonour to poetry,=92=92 he said.

        Hey friends:

        With slight apologies for the self-toot, I just wanted to let you
all know that I've got a new book out, one of several books of innovative
prose just published in a new series from Avec Books. Here's some short
descriptions of the books in the series and information on how to access
them through Avec's website and Small Press Distribution:


*Available September 18th.* (information, excerpts and author information
for the series currently available at: www.poetrypress.com/avec)

Pivotal Prose Series (introducing shorter books of innovative prose).
Pivot: a figure skating move in which the toe pick is placed in the ice as
an anchor and the skater turns in a circle on a back outside edge.

The Pivotal Prose Series revolves around narrativities, poetic prose,
novellas, meditations and writing that defies category. The authors in this
series frequently work in other genres, such as poetry, film or visual art.
The series also rotates around a varied group of contemporary writers. Some
of these texts will appear in translation.



The Big Lie
by  Mark Wallace
Pivotal Prose Series, Avec Books * ISBN: 1-880713-22-5
56 Pages
$7.50

A boy finds an artist's manifesto on the floor, a gay man reflects on his
regrets, a woman suddenly sees a man's face through her car window.  Don't
be fooled if it sounds familiar or credible; in the world of The Big Lie
such simply-told and apparently "sincere" moments are only the iceberg's
tip. Subtly referencing some of the great iconoclasts of literature and
philosophy (Kafka, Wilde, Nietzsche), these vignettes unveil a defiant
sense of contemporary artistic possibility, rising at times into a
full-scale attack on American style consumerism, unmediated authorship, and
the bloated privileges of literary "genius." Quick shifts between styles,
personas and subject matter keep the reader critical and wary. Even when
The Big Lie  demands an art of open questions, the writing remains its own
example, always better-than-advertised.

Benched
by Cydney Chadwick
Pivotal Prose Series, Avec Books * ISBN: 1-880713-23-3
58 Pages
$7.50

A failed man haunted by his successful past, a woman whose academic career
can't hide her alienation and loneliness, a thoughtless young man living
for his next sexual conquest; in Cydney Chadwick's Benched, these three
people move through a world of sinister disconnections in search of
something they don't understand and are never going to find. The book
presents a series of encounters loosely centered around trips to a Hyde
Park bench and a London laundromat at an undefined recent historical moment
in which place and time have become empty measures of people's inevitable
distance from each other. Benched is a minefield of awkward silences, crude
gestures, and small exquisite tortures. This understated and stylish
novella presents the reader with a truly contemporary gothic, in which
grand dramatic horror has given way to the horror hidden in apparently
trivial daily moments broken off from each other like bright, sharp
fragments of an imperceptible dark structure of dissolution and, possibly,
death

Benching with  Virgil
 by Gad Hollander
Pivotal Prose Series, Avec Books * ISBN:1-880713-24-1
58 Pages
$7.50

Benching with Virgil wraps the 'mystery' back inside the enigma. The
Narrator's obsessive, Beckett-like observations seem to go nowhere in
particular, yet the reader does journey around Paris, does recall a girl
reading on a bench, does overhear strange conversations between Mr. Laurel
and Bergson (Hardy is busy hanging curtains), and does get to the crime
scene just in time to be murdered-by the narrator. In Hollander's writing,
the stream-called-consciousness flows beautifully, deceptively, and
continuously. Far more than mere digressions, these are the markings of a
writer on the track of thought, deconstructing his own deductions,
pinpointing the elusive presence of the reader at every twist in the bend.

I want to second Taylor Brady's plug for Bhanu Kapil Rider's new book. It's
a terrific piece of writing. Here's something I wrote to introduce her to
the audience at the Left Hand Reading Series last year.

Bhanu Kapil Rider is the author of The Vertical Interrogation of Strangers,
forthcoming from Kelsey Street Press, and The Autobiography of a Cyborg,
portions of which will be appearing in an upcoming issue of Conjunctions.
In her rich, adventurous, and highly playful work, the postmodern concerns
with the positioning of the subject are given a surprising twist.  For Kapil
Rider, the figure of the cyborg is not to be found in the uncanny suturing
of the human with the machine; rather, she locates it deep inside the human
itself.  The self is always already a hybridity, produced by the competing
and conjoining discourses of parents, family, and cultures.  The human is
that which is complicated by the idea of the human.  Uncanniness arises from
the recognition that "I" is heterogeneous.  Or as she puts it in
Autobiography of a Cyborg, "we don't know how to break this to you: forms
dissolve."  The notion of identity as continuous, unified, and exactly
self-replicating is turned inside out in Kapil Rider's work.  Her cyborg
traverses the world, from India to London to Vegas, in the quest for an
originary, instantiating memory that is produced paradoxically only through
the mechanism of the journey itself.  Identity is nomadic, a process of
dispersion and recovery, but always in a state of flux.  At the same time,
though, this very human cyborg explores both self and her world with a
Blakean delight in the joys of embodiment.  For Kapil Rider, each of us is a
liminal creature, hovering on the threshold between presence and absence,
desire and memory, home and elsewhere, self and Other.

fwd review by Jake Berry



Madonna Septet
Ivan Argüelles

Potes and Poets Press
181 Edgemont Avenue
Elmwood CT 06110-1005

864 pages in 2 vols. $29.00
also available individually for $17 each


 For decades Ivan Argüelles was known for his short to medium length
dense modernist come surreal poetry. By the mid-eighties he was one of
the most widely published poets in circulation. His work in this form
reached it’s pinnacle with SEARCHING FOR MARY LOU: ILLEGAL SYNTAX in
which Argüelles’s poetry was accompanied by the photographs of Craig
Stockfleth. That book received the William Carlos Williams poetry prize
ahead of Gregory Corso’s work among other notables. Then came
PANTOGRAPH, an at least 10 volume (some of it remains unpublished)
reworking of the epic poem that runs as far back as Homer and Gilgamesh
without abandoning James Joyce or Elvis Presley. That’s quite a stretch,

but half a dozen pages into the epic and one realizes that Argüelles is
more than up to the task, in fact he makes it look easy.
 After the completion of PANTOGRAPH what next? What could be left to do?

The answer comes roaring at us out of the new two volume work MADONNA
SEPTET. In the interim between the two books Argüelles drove himself
through a period on intense experimentation with language and form
including collaborations with Jack Foley and John Bennett that produced
work quite unlike anything he had produced before. He brings those
experiences as well as haunting memories, extensive reading of Sanskrit
texts among other readings, and a sense of unfettered abandon to the new

work. And for all that can be said the epic nature and scope of
Argüelles’s poetry (and MADONNA is saturated with that quality), he is
as good line by line as any poet alive and then some. There is an
intensity and dense lyricism that proves the work in its music alone.
Reading the poem one is struck repeatedly by the sheer beauty of his use

of language(s) and is compelled to slow down and savor it. To generate
this kind of response in a poem almost 900 pages long is simply unheard
of in contemporary poetry.
 PANTOGRAPH began with a volume called “that” GODDESS and she reappears
almost immediately in  the new work. Of course the madonna is a goddess
form and one is inclined to read this as an extension of the earlier
work. However, this is Argüelles as we have never read him before. Due
to the period of experiment we see a loser, even broken form, words
break in the middle only to continue later in the poem or sometimes we
get the second half first. One constantly must re-evaluate what one is
reading and becomes aware of deeper currents and countercurrents. The
result is that once again he has reopened the epic lyric. Pound, for all

his research and intelligence never devised anything so multiply
complex, or explored the hinterlands of human imagination so
exhaustively. Argüelles is a soul geographer. Love/ lust/ the erotic
engines of the ages carry the poem, remain its medium right through
oblivion and beyond.

  oblivion as is every line I write obli
  vious of you every time I look you are obli
  vious that I am looking at every line is gone
  you are OBLIVION for -saking every had a line?
  …
  holy madam of Sex what is this ire we are come
  ing to fold over centerpiece

Consider how the reader/listener must almost “sing” the word obli/vious.

We are in the throes of an amazing song which defies all limitation
while simultaneously remaining true to its obsession. The kind of
passion with which this poet sings has vanished except for a handful of
brave souls, and few of those can work in the thin air of the heights
Argüelles explores as a matter of habit.
 Much philosophy and art of the 20th century required a leap, of mind,
of imagination into a domain that lay beyond the worn out metaphysics of

the previous twenty five centuries. Argüelles is well aware of that, but

rather than unweaving the neurosis of the past by quasi-ontology he uses

the modernists tools of mythos, liberated verse and transformed line to
transcend modernism for a poetry that conforms to nothing, not even its
own practice. “a s- ystematic but leap into CHAOS” - and what chaos does

he mean? The chaos of systems theory as the line seems to suggest or is
this mythology, the Greek preternatural chaos, the “with out form and
void” of the Bible, or something we might only experience by way of the
poem? Like Artaud, Argüelles constantly struggles against the
limitations that confront anyone working at the boundaries of language,
and he is no less vigilant, even violent in defeating those limitations
time and again.

   no conso-lation but in detritus
   the whole beside its “self”
   eaten to the core by loss of wit

One cannot help but recall Rimbaud’s demand for derangement of the
senses and what the surrealists and Beat writers did with it, and these
are both sources. Especially in certain passages this poem has a more
jazz influenced/ scat singing feel than most of PANTOGRAPH ?? it seems
to work in a freer space:

  flux a the heavy unh fix
  I need a frame “bad”
  Driver, follow that cab
  the poem’s out of Mind
  houses burning in the gutter
  disarrangement of all “poesy”
  burn the marigolds gladiolas irises
  hubba hubba …

Yet, through every line we are confronted with a poem that is unlike
anything that anyone has ever written. It takes more chances, makes
audacious proclamations, profanes all poetry in the act of transfiguring

the art according to intuition’s disruptive convolutions. This is not to

suggest that the poem ever becomes  athematic or purely automatic
writing. Paradoxically it is simultaneously chaotic and always on theme.

Argüelles writes/sings here, perhaps more than in any of his previous
poems, as if he were driven, as if he were ridden by forces that insist
on the poem’s appearance. One imagines him day after day writing in a
fevered sweat to get the voices out before they are overwhelmed by the
next chorus. As with much of his work, but especially here, he seems to
be articulating a beautiful, exquisitely detailed madness, and no matter

how deeply we engage the poem we will never be able to drink the full
draught of that madness.
 What we can do however is open ourselves to how the poem might live in
us and allow it to inhabit the unique space it demands, remembering a
work like the MADONNA SEPTET has no ultimate resolution. Instead it
sounds and reverberates and invokes those chthonic and heavenly powers
which have fascinated all humanity always and probably forever will. As
such it is, like all Argüelles poetry, a vital oracle, to consult and
dwell within, to revel in its music and revelation and be grateful the
poet was there to bring the voices forward for the rest of us to hear.
MADONNA SEPTET is  a record of Argüelles at the top of his art,
quintessential work by an artist essential to know.

> Susan Schultz---

   Yeah, but do you really think that metaphor is primarily really about "sameness"

   in an age of "difference" (or say it w/ obligatory fr. accent)?
   A good case can be, and in fact has been, made (by both detractors and
defenders)
   of metaphor that metaphor is no more about sameness than it is about
difference---
   this is what distinguishes it from simile perhaps....
    So, if A = B (truth is a rat-infested subway stop, for instance), the
"sameness"
    implies its opposite, too, the "absurdity" of the link. Even in Shakespeare and

    other pre-20th century texts, metaphor is often used this way....
    there is something else going on, beyond (or at least unregistered by) the
level of
    prose logic....

    So, IN GENERAL, what I don't get (TO ANYBODY; OPEN QUESTION; please answer,
etc., etc) is why METONYMY (the most known of which would be
     SYNECDOCHE; that town Michael Gizzi was born in) is considered
     better, more progressive, more feminist, etc?
         This argument has never made sense for me, for metonymy seems more
        reductive, less dynamic, etc.....

            Curious, curious.....

Here is the odd tale of the man whose work inspired Ashbery's _Girls on the
Run_.  I'm sure some of you have already seen this.

He Was Obsessed With Little Girls and Perhaps He Was a Genius.

September 16, 2000

By SARAH BOXER


He has inspired a book of poetry ("Girls on the Run" by John Ashbery),
fashion designs (by Anna Sui), a British rock band (the Vivian Girls), a
Hawaiian dance ("The Valley of Io"), a video game (Sissy Fight at
www.sissyfight.com), an opera (being composed by Douglas Cuomo), a play
("Jennie Richee" by Mac Wellman, opening in February at the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Chicago) and a movie prospect (now canceled). He has
been compared to Lewis Carroll, Fra Angelico, Andy Warhol, Balthus and Dr.
Seuss. The word "genius" has often been used near his name, but so,
occasionally, have the words "mind of a serial killer." His work has been
called part "Child's Garden of Verses," part "pedophilic fantasy." He drew
tribes of little girls, and gave some of them little penises.

  Henry Darger (1892-1973) spent much of his life in Chicago rummaging
through trash cans, going to Mass, writing about the weather and fighting
with tangled balls of twine. When he died, he left an apartment filled with
hundreds of old Pepto Bismol bottles; plastic maple syrup containers; balls
of string; a windup Edison phonograph; a music box, and plaster figurines o=
f
Jesus and Mary. That was not all.

  "Where there was any wall space, and tacked around every door frame, were
pictures of little girls that had been cut out of magazines, newspapers and
coloring books," Michael Bonesteel writes in "Henry Darger: Art and Selecte=
d
Writings," to be published by Rizzoli in November. There were pictures of
the Dionne quintuplets, some 20 pictures of the Coppertone Girl and many
pictures of Little Annie Roonie.

  Two trunks held a lifetime of writing: a 5,000-page, eight-volume work
titled "The History of My Life," which included thousands of pages on a
single tornado; a weather journal covering exactly 10 years, from Dec. 31,
1957, to Dec. 31, 1967; and a series of diaries detailing how many times he
went to Mass and his many tantrums over twine.

  The biggest surprise was a creepy, obsessive 15,000- page manuscript type=
d
in different colored inks. It was called "The Story of the Vivian Girls, in
What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal of the Glandico-Angelinian Wars,
as Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion." And it had an 8,500-page sequel,
"Further Adventures in Chicago."


  The Vivian girls

Violet, Joice, Jennie, Catherine, Hettie, Daisy and Evangeline are the
heroines of "The Realms." They unite with gentle, child-loving dragons
called the Blengiglomenean Serpents (Blengins for short) in a
four-year--seven-month war (fought sometime between 1910 and 1917 and
roughly following the outlines of World War I) against the Glandelinians, a
race of fallen Catholics who enslave and torture children. In the end, the
girls prevail and so do the Catholic nations of Abbieannia, Angelinia,
Abyssinkile, Protestentia and Calverinia, but not before many children are
tortured and killed.

  If Darger had left only the text, he might be just another forgotten
recluse. But he also made 300 illustrations everything from small
watercolors to 12-foot-long mural-size scrolls, often painted on both sides=
.

  Darger crammed his huge, fantastical landscapes with baby-faced girls,
some clothed in colorful dresses, bathing suits and pinafores, and others
naked. He equipped certain girls with horns and others with penises; he
showed some being disemboweled or strangled, tongues lolling out, and he
drew others enjoying the sunshine, the butterflies and the huge flowers. Th=
e
girls' eyes, as John MacGregor, a pre-eminent Darger scholar, has pointed
out, shine in the dark because Darger filled them in with pencil lead.

  Darger had trouble drawing figures, so he traced or cut and pasted images
taken from comics, children's books and magazines. If they weren't the righ=
t
size, he had them enlarged at his local drugstore. The results were
stunning. The Nation's critic Arthur Danto has called Darger "a genius of
stammering achievement." Time magazine's critic Robert Hughes has toyed wit=
h
the term "Poussin of pedophilia."

  Darger (pronouced DAHR-gurr) had a rotten childhood. When he was 4, his
mother died while giving birth to his sister, who was put up for adoption.
As a child, Darger was not fond of girls. He "threw ashes in one little
girl's eyes and tried to slash another girl with a knife," Mr. Bonesteel
writes. When he was 8, his father, a tailor, could no longer take care of
him.

  Darger went to live in a Catholic mission. Apparently he was thrown out
for masturbating. He was put in the Asylum for Feeble- Minded Children in
Lincoln, Ill. There he became absorbed with religious rituals. He once
wrote, "I burned holy pictures and hit the face of Christ in pictures with
my fist." At 16 he ran away from the asylum. For the next half-century, Mr.
Bonesteel tells us, Darger worked "as a janitor, dishwasher and bandage
roller at three Chicago hospitals."

  He lived a life of magnificent confinement. The room he occupied had no
kitchen or bathroom, and the great events of his life were meteorological.
He went to Mass as many as four or five times a day. "He would rarely speak
to anyone, but if spoken to would respond politely always about the
weather," his landlord, Nathan Lerner, recalled in a written statement. "He
was a remarkable mimic and sometimes there would be an animated quarrel
going on between a deep gruff voice, which was supposed to be he, and a
querulous high-pitched voice, which was supposed to be his superior, a nun.=
"

  Kiyoko Lerner, the widow of Darger's landlord, remembered that Darger
"would walk around the neighborhood picking through garbage string,
magazines, newspapers, books, anything." He brought everything into his roo=
m
and never took anything out. The room was packed floor to ceiling. A narrow
pathway ran from the door to the desk, where Darger both worked and, it
seems, slept.

  In 1972, old and crippled, Darger moved to a place he called Little
Sisters of the Poor, a nursing home in Chicago. He died on April 13, 1973,
and was given a pauper's burial at All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines, Ill.

  Darger's real life, though, was with his Vivian girls. "The first
indication that Darger had stepped across the line between reality and
fantasy happened in the summer of 1912," Mr. Bonesteel writes in his book.
"He dubbed the catalytic event `The Great Aronburg Mystery.' "

  Darger apparently lost a photograph he had cut from The Chicago Daily New=
s
of May 9, 1911, a picture of a murdered child named Elsie Paroubek. In "The
Realms" she became the model for Annie Aronburg, a martyr who is slashed
with a razor and strangled.

  While Darger was obsessed with children in general, he and his only
friend, Whilliam Schloeder, formed a two-man club they called the Children'=
s
Protective Society, he was particularly taken with the photograph of Elsie.
(Mr. MacGregor has suggested that Darger murdered her.) Darger bargained
with God. "If the picture were not returned by a certain time, and he kept
pushing the date farther and farther ahead, he would turn the tide of the
war against the Christian nations," Mr. Bonesteel writes. God did not
respond, and Darger started drawing little girls being massacred by the
Glandelinians.

  At that point, the story became "a blood bath," as Stewart Lee Allen wrot=
e
in a review of a Darger show in The San Franciso Bay Guardian, quoting
Darger's script: "Little girls, from the ages of 9, 8 and even younger, wer=
e
tied down stark naked and a spade full of red-hot live coals laid on their
bellies. Scores upon scores of poor children were cut to pieces, after bein=
g
strangled to death. . . . Children were forced to swallow the sliced
fragments of dead children's hearts. . . . Their protruding tongues were
extracted."

  The killing did not stop until Col. Henry Darger joined forces with the
Vivian girls. And then, Mr. Bonesteel says, the war quickly ended. Gen. Joh=
n
Manley, the chief villain of "The Realms," named for a bully from Darger's
childhood, surrendered.

  Darger the artist was saved by one man: his landlord, Nathan Lerner, a
photographer trained at the New Bauhaus in Chicago. If he had not
intervened, the paintings and manuscripts would probably have been
destroyed. "I told him to throw them away," says Mr. Lerner's widow, who
owns the rights to Darger's work.

  Darger became a darling of outsider art. In 1977 his work was shown at th=
e
Hyde Park Art Center. Other shows followed, most of them put on by the
Phyllis Kind Gallery, and most of them linking Darger with outsider art or
Art Brut, a tradition of madness and creativity that went back to painters
like Bosch, Bruegel, Goya and G=E9ricault.

  But Darger's status really soared in 1997, when the Museum of American
Folk Art in New York mounted a show put together at the University of Iowa
by Stephen Prokopoff. Now the Art Brut Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, own=
s
more than 20 Dargers.

  Mr. Bonesteel is compiling a condensed version of "The Realms." There is
talk of a Darger study center in New York that would include his writings.
And the Intuit Gallery in Chicago is working on a reconstruction of Darger'=
s
room. Jane Kallir, the director of the Galerie St.  tienne in Manhattan,
says, "You can get a very good Darger for $75,000 to $80,000."

  How did this happen? "It is the quality, the magnitude, the crowded
cluttered composition, the unfathomability" of the work, Brooke Anderson,
the director and curator of the Contemporary Center at the Museum of
American Folk Art, says. And of course, she adds, there is "the secrecy, th=
e
privacy." Ms. Lerner says "the size is one thing" that draws people to the
paintings, but it is also that they are "so raw." There is "no hypocrisy" i=
n
them, she says. He was not thinking of an audience.

  Or was he?

  Darger, Mr. Bonesteel suggests, may actually have anticipated an audience
when Annie Aronburg, his character, says "she will have all the battle
manuscripts `published as soon as I can, so the world shall know.' " Darger
noted in his 15,000-page novel that "editors of great experience will in du=
e
time be allowed to go over the whole work most carefully."

  Some people think that Darger even anticipated other artists. His "use of
cut-outs from magazines, comic strips and coloring books prefigures the sam=
e
kind of appropriations by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein," Mr. Bonesteel
observes. And Ms. Kallir says: "Darger was an unwitting postmodernist,
though he couldn't have conceived what that was. He saw behind the facade o=
f
mid-century prosperity and propriety. He deconstructed those cutesy images
and saw the sexuality and truth behind them."

  When Darger was a boy, his nickname was Crazy. These days he is embraced
with the term outsider. His tombstone offers another alternative: "Henry
Darger, 1892- 1973, Artist, Protector of Children."

Lines, Breaths and Words - What Defines a Poem Visually?

Review by Komninos Zervos


The Written Poem - Semiotic Conventions from Old to Modern English
Rosemary Huisman Continuum, 1998 RRP $AU 38.47 ISBN 0 304
70734(paperback)

For anyone interested in the many ways in which poetry can be written
and read, this book provides a cultural and literary mapping by
investigating the semiotic conventions of the genre 'poetry'. For me
it was exceptionally timely. You get to a point in your PhD research
when everything you read, see and hear seems relevant to the study.
That's the time for consolidation, focussing, for suring up the
thesis, time to get down to saying exactly what you want to say, and
time to say no to any further input. But, as is the nature of academic
research, once you have the knowledge you cannot ignore it, as each
piece in the inevitably unsolvable jigsaw puzzle seems important but
unable to be placed, at this stage, into place. Such is the case with
the book I am reviewing, Rosemary Huisman's 'The Written Poem'.
Instead of introducing new aspects to my understanding of the various
poetries, their production, practice,  practitioners and  audiences,
this book actually helped me to consolidate my own observations of the
many ways poetries can be written and read, or spoken and heard. In my
study I am grappling with what a poem is in its sounding, and what
poetry looks like and how it is being read in cyberspace. I thought
the findings of a scholar of old english texts and on the topic of the
written poem would be quite different to my own, but was pleasantly
surprised when we seemed to arrive at similar conclusions but from
seemingly opposite directions. At the same time this book helped me to
see the body of published poetry in a new way, from a different
perspective, as cyberspace has made me look at poetry differently.

The period of study spans eight hundred years and is refreshingly
concerned with the workings of poetry rather than the nationality of
the literary genre. The book argues that poetry has to be recognised
as poetry before it is read as poetry. So poetry is poetry by the
standards developed to recognise it as poetry, by the way it looks to
the human eye, it's visual form or seen form, it's graphology as
Huisman calls it. Yet the visual poem is a complex signifier, and can
be read in many ways. We read the way a poem looks long before we read
a word as language. Huisman investigates the semiosis of the seen
poem, the semiotic of poem as art object, the semiotic of the body and
layers of meaning brought to a poem by the performance or presentation
of it, and the semiotic of language and the readings of meaning in
words and their spatial arrangement on a page. It is a thorough
examination of the many ways we write and read poetry. She argues that
the written poem, that is, the poem written to be read silently, has
only really developed over the past one hundred years. The writing
down or publishing of poetry prior to the twentieth century being a
representation in written language of a phonological poetry, poetry
that used rhyme and rhythm, and sounds of spoken language. In old
english manuscripts she finds greater correlation in the semiotic
conventions with twentieth century poetry than with any periods of
poetry in between. This was a revelation for me, as I had never quite
made the distinction before. As a performance poet I was aware that
some poetry suited performance and some did not, but this book has
allowed me to understand why.

Despite recent millenial predictions about the crisis in poetry,
publishing, and the lack of good Australian Literary criticism (by
certain more traditional sections of academia) books like Huisman's
are living proof of a healthy debate and the presence of worthy
Australian theorists. Along with other theorists McKenzie Wark, Hazel
Smith, Roger Dean, Kevin Brophy, Martin Johnston, Ilana Snyder, Susan
Hawthorne, Patricia Wise, David Holmes and others Huisman's book
helps us in our understanding of poetry as a social process, as a
cultural entity and as a media element. Solid theory exemplified by
practical sampling from an Australian cultural record.

This book is a must for any scholar of poetry, any reader of poetry,
any writer of poetry, and any teacher of writing.

I'm wanting to take a couple of classes of Penn State students to New York
to see a reading or performance and to witness the kind of energy there is
around literary events in the city.  I'm having some trouble, though,
finding listings for events on November week-ends.  We need the lead time
to get commitments, press the dean for a bus, etc.; it has to be a week-end
for all the typical reasons.  I know about the Word of Mouth reading and
the House of Pernod at the Poetry Project.  Does anyone know of other good
stuff going on in the city on a week-end (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) this
November?  Please let me know.  Thanks.

PARIS, June 16 (AFP) =97 Lovers of French literature are shedding tears of

despair at the news that a cultural centre in the Yemeni city of Aden

named after Arthur Rimbaud -- poet -- has been turned into a hotel named

after John Rambo -- Hollywood war-hero.

The three-story house, where the poet himself stayed in the 1880s,

was inaugurated as the Maison de Rimbaud in 1994, but three years later

lack of French government funding forced it to close down.

On a recent visit to Aden, Rimbaud-enthusiast Jose-Marie Bel was

shocked to find that a building that once spread the beauties of Gallic

civilisation was now dedicated to the epitome of American machismo.

=91=91There is a big sign outside saying Hotel Rambo,=92=92 said Bel, who =

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Dear all --

I am presently undertaking a project of translating some of the poems of
the French poet Tristan Corbiere.  Corbiere usually gets called a
Symbolist, since he was contemporary with those guys, but I find his work
to be really different, very much his own, but feel that he hasn't been
recognized the way he should be due to dull translations.  I think his
work is wild -- it's full of slang and wordplay and tends to be
quick-paced and jazzy -- but most of the translations I've found (and
there aren't all that many) tend to make him seem stiff and old-fashioned.
I want to expose the extreme dexterity and innovation I see in him.

I'm wondering if anyone out there is familiar with his work and could talk
to me about it a bit more.  Or if people know of recent translations in
journals or other places.  Or if there are any French poets on this list
who might be able to shed more light on his life and work.

Thanks so much.

Arielle

I can't understand why not.  A simpler example would be the statement
that a composer composing for two voices would have to be more
innovative, other things being equal, than one composing for one
voice.  The other things that'd be equal would be, mainly, the
composer's creativity, experience in the art, well-fedness,
emotional support, etc.  The composer for two voices simply has much
more to work with than the composer for one voice.  Where he wants to,
he can match the other composer by composing for one voice; but he can
also contrast or harmonize his two voices.  Etc.

If not, then other things are not equal.  If Donne and Herbert are
equally innovative verbally (quantitatively and qualitatively), then
if Herbert is at all innovative visually, he ought to be more
innovative than Donne.  If he can't work his visual innovations into
his poetry effectively, though, it may be that the results are less than
Donne's.

But I would say that if he is equal to Donne as a poet, then his use
of more elements--or, in fact, a whole extra sensual modality--must
make him more innovative.

Ditto.  (But I have to say that Cummings is the most innovative poet
I know of that our country has produced.)

I'd never say a visual poem must automatically be more innovative than
a textual one.  Just that--well, I think my one voice/ two voice
example says it all.  (Remember also, that my inital question was in
response to Bill Austin's saying that language poets have been a good
deal more innovative than visual poets.)

Bob G.,

I recognize the distinctions you're trying to make, but I think the
terminology you insist on doesn't really get us anywhere.

The term "visual" appeals to the sensorium, to perception, but not to
cognition.  "Visual" only means that something is perceptible by sight.
That's really all there is to it.

There are significant aesthetic differences between a "visual" text and a
more traditional text, but, again, the differences are semiotic and
phenomenological, a matter of how certain kinds of signs are understood and
experienced.  A traditional text appears less visual because its perception
verges on the automatic.

Re ON WORD (WF 1000) edited by Bob Cobbing and Lawrence Upton

This anthology, designated as Writers Forum's one thousandth publication,
*is going ahead.

[In fact, as happened with the anthology WORD SCORE UTTERANCE CHOREOGRAPHY,
published as WF750, the count has already passed the symbolic number and WF
has just published the 8th book in its second thousand - ISBN 0 84254 007 6]

However, due to lack of finance, it will be necessary to publish it as a
serial publication with perhaps half a dozen poets in an issue.

It is hoped that the initial publication will appear early in 2001.

It is likely that we shall be looking to publish substantially more than the
4 pp per poet invited previously. However, *all submissions will be taken
into account before we proceed to the selection of poets for the first issue
and you are still welcome to submit work for consideration.

A further announcement will be made shortly and, at that point, everyone who
has submitted work with return postage or with an email address for reply
will hear from us.

Many thanks for your patience. (The WF website has not been updated for a
little while and that will be attended to as soon as possible)

Chris S--To answer your challenge, I was writing out of the context of the
first book I recommended, namely Derek Walcott's _Omeros_, in which the
operative metaphor is _The Iliad/Odyssey_ = life in the contemporary
Caribbean.  This kind of cross-cultural but also cross-power differential
metaphor, as Walcott discovers toward the middle of his epic, is highly
problematic.  He's trying to write a postcolonial epic with a colonial
metaphor at its center.  Kamau Brathwaite, whose work is every bit as
drenched with European allusions, tries to get away from this problem by
employing more metonomy than metaphor, as I read it.  My reading continued
to be contextual, Chris, in that I was also referring to the situation in
Hawai`i, where metaphors like Hawai`i = mainland have been used to abuse a
place that is not equivalent to elsewhere.  You'd get a hell of a lot of
arguments here about a statement like "Hawaiians are Americans" (a metaphor
that is also a legal fact).

I agree with you that difference (with or without accent) is part of
metaphor, but the differences do need to be unpacked from a mechanism that,
to my mind, emphasizes sameness.  As you know, I sling far more metaphors
than metonomies in my own work, so this isn't a question for me of
preference.  These contexts simply put me on guard that there are dangers
involved in slinging metaphors (just as you once noted that one can
inadvertently dredge up stereotypes from the operation of the language
itself and must work against that).  One of the reasons I find Walcott's
work so interesting is that he engages the issue rather than working around
it.

But there is no such thing as "other things being equal."  The idea here
seems to be that innovation might be a quantitative measure.  Thus poet A,
who confines his/her innovations to non-visualizable language, will
automatically be less innovative than poet B, whose innovations extend to
the visual layout of the text, assuming that B is somehow = equal = in
other respects. It sounds logical enough, but does it obtain in the real
world?  Is Donne less innovative that Herbert?  Is cummings more
innovative than WCW? It seems to me that a qualitative judgment must also
be made, otherwise we'd be forced into some counterintuitive conclusions.
Even when it's the same writer who produces a visual text and another
*non*visual poem. There is nothing to predict, a priori, that the first
will be more innovative than the second. This is to be decided
inductively, after the fact, not as some sort of spurious deductive
principle.

I didn't say it.  Your comments above make  sense to me.  Some privilege
"technical" innovations over other kinds.  Of course we might argue endlessly
about the meaning of that word in the arena of art.  Is technical innovation
restricted to manipulations of surfaces?  What about content?  Is an
innovation in content/tone/etc. inevitably also one of form?  Charles Olson
seemed to think so?  Is metonymy technical?  Is metaphor?  They are certainly
techniques.  Interesting issues to explore, perhaps because there are no easy
answers.  Best, Bill

Subject:      FREE Laughing Gland issues left: previously unpublished bpNichol
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hello all,

I publish a small journal of creative and critical work called Laughing
Gland, first through the University of Albert and now (for a few more
months, anyway) through the University of Victoria.  It was originally
intended to act as a forum for students as well as a bridge leading beyond
the university, but this is just not always the case!

I mean, in the most recent issue we published:

* "BUIK: Glasgow Dialects"--a previously unpublished sound poem by bpNichol
*poems by Derek Beaulieu
*poems by Rob McLennan
*An interview with Karl Siegler given by myself
*an essay on Marlowe and Sodomy discourse by Daniel Martin
*a review of Toy Story 2

I have what _looks_ like a hundred issues left over.  It's important to us
that Laughing Gland be distributed for free, freely, but since I can't
afford to mail out all 100 copies, I _will_ mail issues for free to the
first 20 people who respond.

I hope someone's interest out there is peeked!

All the best, Lori Emerson

Subject:      Word of Mouth event in Oakland, CA
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Please join me at Diesel Bookstore this Thursday, September 21st at
7:30pm, to celebrate the publication of the Anthology "Word of Mouth"
an anthology of Gay American Poetry from the past 50 years.

Contributors to the anthology include James Schuyler, Robert Duncan,
W.H. Auden, John Ashbery, Carl Phillips, Allen Ginsberg, Frank
O'Hara, Kenward Elmslie, J.D. McClatchy, Stephen Jonas, Joe Brainard,
Taylor Mead, John Wieners, William Bronk, Wayne Koestenbaum, Tom
Carey, Gerrit Lansing, Rafael Campo, Justin Chin, Edwin Denby, Mark
Wunderlich, Leland Hickman, Robin Blaser and David Trinidad.  Yikes!
What an assortment!  The book also contains the very first
publication anywhere of a 1948 poem by the one and only Jack Spicer.

Edited by Tim Liu and published by Talisman House, "Word of Mouth"
cuts across formal and aesthetic boundaries in its' inclusions. At
the same time, it foregoes the usual focus on subject matter to ask
broader questions about what constitutes Gay American Poetry at the
end of the twentieth and the beginning of the twenty-first century.

Diesel Bookstore is located at 5433 College Ave in Oakland, just a
short walk from the Rockridge BART station.

Reading from the anthology are contributors Aaron Shurin, Thom Gunn,
Dan Bellm, Forest Hamer, Tom Carey, Doug Powell, as well as myself.

Please join us for this historic event. And please pass along
information about this reading to your students, fellow poets,
readers, etc. By Word of Mouth...

DIESEL, A BOOKSTORE,
5433 College Ave,
Oakland, Ca 94618.

Interesting that Darger and his colleague tried to
adopt a child. I wonder what would have happened to
that child if he had not been prevented from doing so.
I dare say she would have been very comprehensively
"protected". Scenes from Edward Gorey's "The Loathsome
Couple" come to mind.

I note that those nice folks at the Fresh Petals
web-site appear to be big fans.

Eech!, in other words.

Subject:      Atelos announces the publication of Verisimilitude by Hung Q. Tu
Mime-Version: 1.0

Verisimilitude
by Hung Q. Tu

    Atelos is pleased to announce the publication on November 6, 2000 of
Verisimilitude by Hung Q. Tu.


About the book:
    In the sequence of poems that make up Verisimilitude, Hung Q. Tu
presents a skeptical and often comic view of the array (and disarray)
comprising post-Vietnam War culture The poems are lyric in mode, suspicious
in tone. The pace is fast, the scope panoramic. The works reflect Hung Q.
Tu's interest in documentaries and documentation, the modes by which
contemporary American (or Americanized) culture attempts to portray itself
and authorize its undertakings:

flatten Nagasaki / break -- code / cold erode / as postmodern / as a
cul-de-sac / provide a reading / map crazy / engineering fan / blueprint
fantasies / an invisible light / bouncing between / two bicycle reflectors/
deaf-tone / "point to it son".


About the author:
    Hung Q. Tu was born in Vietnam but grew up in San Diego, California.
His first book of poetry, A Great Ravine, was published by Parenthesis
Writing Series. He received his BA in Literature at the University of
California, San Diego and has an MFA degree in Creative Writing from San
Francisco State University. He is a founding editor of the literary
publisher, Krupskaya.


About the project:
    Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of Hip's Road. It is devoted to
publishing, under the sign of poetry, writing which challenges the
conventional definitions of poetry, since such definitions have tended to
isolate poetry from intellectual life, arrest its development, and curtail
its impact. All the works published as part of the Atelos project are
commissioned specifically for it, and each is involved in some way with
crossing traditional genre boundaries, including, for example, those that
would separate theory from practice, poetry from prose, essay from drama,
the visual image from the verbal, the literary from the non-literary, and
so forth. The Atelos project when complete will consist of 50 volumes;
Verisimilitude is volume 7. The project directors and editors are Lyn
Hejinian and Travis Ortiz; cover production and design is by Ree Hall.

Alien Tatters
by Clark Coolidge

    Atelos is pleased to announce the publication on November 6, 2000 of
Alien Tatters by Clark Coolidge.

About the book:
    Coolidge's Alien Tatters is a series of prose-poem meditations in
response to (someone's) sightings of UFOs and encounters with aliens. The
writer has been / is being abducted. The writings are the situation's
tatters, its tatterings. Inevitably funny (except perhaps to the true
believer), the work is also sad and scary. "Lights came. My god, blobs. A
sneaky little rill. Bought them a box of shoes made of chocolate. Small
silver wire, challenge kit. The Frenchman walks off into the noise with his
girl. From the bottom of the craft, enough darkness to fill, replace all
our missing nights."

About the author:
    Clark Coolidge grew up in Providence, Rhode Island and has lived in
Manhattan, Cambridge, San Francisco, Boulder, Rome, the Berkshire Hills; he
currently lives in Petaluma, California. A poet with markedly heterogeneous
interests, Coolidge's work is characteristically energetic, multilayered,
and moody. He is the author of over thirty books, the most recent of which
are Now It's Jazz (writings on music), Bomb (written in conjunction with
visual images by Keith Waldrop), and On the Nameways (poems written in
response to and while watching films).

About the project:
    Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of Hip's Road. It is devoted to
publishing, under the sign of poetry, writing which challenges the
conventional definitions of poetry, since such definitions have tended to

ward and bob:

     there is a fairly extensive history in modern art and psychology
which asserts that the visual is purely 'cognitive' 'intellectual' and
uninvolved with emotional, visceral, gestural, etc.  one can see
something, one can see a picture, one can see a picture on a computer
screen, one can move awy from the computer screen.  while, the other
distinction, noted below this might seem like a word quibble I think
it's important for art. and not just a word game.
    one can be intellectual and uninvolved, but that's not 'art' for me.

Not really. Rimbaud spent most of his life as a colonialist exploiter in
Africa (often I thought Rimbaud was the model of Kurtz in "Heart of
Darkness"). When somebody in Africa turns the table and uses Rimbaud's name,
the French establishment sheds pious tears.

Anyhow, we have already discussed avant garde's tendency to turn in
advertizement. Also, Rimbaud and Rambo are profoundly related in a global
world. The poem I posted, which I wrote about fours years ago, is actually
titled "Rambo" and is part of poems around the name of Rimbaud, another being
"Rai/n/bow."

Thanks for the note.

Dave,

The "Verlaine and Rimbaud" line of Dylan's is from a song called "You're
Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go," which is on BLOOD ON THE TRACKS.

************

this passage from Jonathan M. is interesting... what precisely *is*
the meaning of  "innovation"...often, there is a lot of anxiety
encoded in these questions;  it rather reminds me of a couple of
years ago, when 2 very bright and excellent poets published a
dialogue, in which they agreed that (the scene, which they identified
themselves with, which they called) "avant-garde" poetry, would lose
all meaning if it became the mainstream because *its point was to be
in rebellion..*

is this true?

it strikes me that many of the poets i feel closest to, across the
country, are writing out of a sense of the possiblity of their own
work, of their own agendas..of where their writing is pointing..

they aren't precisely worried about whether they are "in rebellion"
against something.... nor (and i admit, this is a different tho
related issue) about whether they are "innovating" ..... in fact,
many find these questions uninteresting or amusing..

for the conservative mainstream, where the ego and "accomplishment"
of the individual talent is all, Bloom's "anxiety of influence"
provided a useful trope, a summery of the things many poets felt
fretful about...for those outside the mainstream, it would appear
that "the anxiety of innovation" is a similar haunting presence...

the poets whose work excites me the most, seem often to be keeping
their eye on the ball;  they're not too concerned with making sure
they try to be innovative...but,  it is a preoccupation that bedevils
many of us

(i don't mean to imply that any of this is Jonathan's
problem..patently, it is not;  i just got to thinking again about
these issues because of the way the thread was focusing so intently
on how to judge "innovativeness",  and his passage was a useful thing
to bounce off of;  also, obviously, i'm not so much responding to his
points as branching a related thread off at a tangent....)

You certainly described my point of view correctly, and it looks like
Taylor thinks you did justice to his, and everything's okay, I guess.

Not true.  Context can determine the meaning of a word.  To call
something obviously visual (at least on a page) "visual" is to give
a secondary meaning to the term, "visual."  It is saying that in this
visible poetry that which is visible is important enough for us to
distinguish said poetry on the basis of it from other also visible
poetry (which I call, "textual poetry," which is redundant in the same
way, the term, "visual poetry," is, in this case to emphasize the high
importance of the textuality of the poetry).

The term, "language poetry," came about the same way.

I would say it IS less visual because it goes from the eye to a
preliminary visual center and then to the cognitive center where
reading occurs instead of to the major visual center where things
are seen.  (No, that's not according to standard neurophysiology,
just my own theory.)  The visible letters of traditional poetry
are read, not seen.  The visible letters of visual poetry are seen
AND read.  And, yes, in reply to someone else who wrote me about
this, the tension between seeing and reading is a large element
(I'd say virtue) of visual poetry.

>From what you and others have said, though, I guess I do need to make my
definition more rigorous: so here it is again: "visual poetry is what
results when the visual appearance of some portion of a poem's textual
matter makes an aesthetically significant contribution to the poem's
central expressive value."

"significantly," of course, brings in subjectivity.

I think we would all agree that the visuality that allows us to
recognize what a given word is, is aesthetically null.  I would go
further and claim that any visual element in a poem which is of
only punctuational importance is also aesthetically insignificant
(visually): e.g., conventionally-used bold-facing, italics, spacing
used to indicate rests--or not important enough to make a conventional
textual poem a visual poem.  Calligraphy and the like is decorative
(unless if does more than simply make a text pretty).

I would claim that (on the page) visible elements that indicate
words' identities or that punctuate are verbal; visual poetry contains
visible elements that are not verbal.

There's more to it than that, but I'm too tired to go further.

I've been cross because (1) who likes those who nit-pick a definition
one has worked years on (believe it or not) and (2) the statement that
all poetry is visual poetry annoys me--because it indicates an ignorance
as to what visual poetry does, which is much more, visually, than other
forms of (not necessarily inferior) poetry.  But I thank one and all for
the nits because they WILL force me to improve my definition, and
explanation/defense thereof.

POETRY CENTER 2000
The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

an evening of words & music
TOM RAWORTH & BRUCE ACKLEY
Thursday, September 28, 7:30 pm, $5 donation
@ the Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

". . . in unbroken sunlight
wearing masks
as aids to memory
attributed to interiors unknown . . ."
(from "Dark Senses")

TOM RAWORTH returns to San Francisco from his home in Cambridge,
England-tonight in a duo 'words & music' performance setting.  No more a
stranger to the improvised music world than he is to these Western shores,
Mr. Raworth has worked collaboratively with American master Steve Lacy,
Italian reeds-player Giancarlo Locatelli, French contrabassist-singer
Joelle Leandre, et al.  A large new edition of his selected poems,
Tottering State, is out from O Books, here in Oakland.  Born at
Bexleyheath, Kent, England, in 1938, and having lived throughout the States
in numerous situations (Chicago, Bowling Green, OH., Austin, TX., San
=46rancisco, San Diego, Atlanta), Mr. Raworth owns the singular distinction
of filling the "plus one" position in the French anthology _21 +1 po=E8tes
americains_ (Editions Royaumont).  Further news locatable at
http://www.geocities.com/raworth.geo  *  Soprano saxophonist BRUCE ACKLEY's
premiere album under his own name, The Hearing (Avant), is a beauty worth
lingering over-a trio date with stellar bassist Greg Cohen and drummer Joey
Baron (2/4ths of John Zorn's great quartet Masada).  Mr. Ackley, founding
member of Rova Saxophone Quartet (http://www.rova.org ), is one of the
surest, sublest, and more graciously accomplished players in the Bay Area
improvised music community-or elsewhere.  He lives in San Francisco.

Note: my (just) previous announcement carries the word "tonight" embedded
in its text.  "Tonight" in this instance is meant in the figurative,
futural sense..... "Tonight" will be "tonight" on Thursday night, NEXT
WEEK, Sept. 28th.    Like Archie Shepp famously said, "On This Great
Night"....

forthcoming this Saturday, 30 September 2000
here, on the Poetics List . . .


          A Poetics Colloquium: Body/Sex/Writing


an experimental use of the Poetics List as a forum for extended
considerations/responses engaging a suggested field of issues;
the topic in this case has been introduced by Dodie Bellamy in
her short piece =Body/Sex/Writing=.

featuring responses by:

Taylor Brady
Robert Gluck
Laura Moriarty
Jen Hofer
Kevin Killian
Joe Amato
Kristin Prevallet
Michael Kelleher
Robin Tremblay-McGaw
David Buuck
Juliana Spahr
Susan Wheeler
Mark Wallace
Alicia Cohen
Matthias Regan
Ron Silliman
Rachel Blau DuPlessis
Brian Stefans
Jonathan Skinner


Who was asked: invitations were made to subscribers and non-subscribers
alike based on previous writings on this topic, either in posts to the
Poetics List or in other publications; many were invited, and I am
grateful to these who came forward to participate.

What is hoped-for: that this exchange will challenge the formal constraints
of the listserv, chiefly its tendency toward shorter and more ephemeral
statements vis-a-vis traditionally-published documents; and, on the
contrary,
that this exchange can exploit the tendency of the listserv to informal
dialogue and rapid response, extending this colloquium past the Colloquium
and into broader conversation.

Bob Grumman wrote "A simpler example would be the statement that a composer
composing for two voices would have to be more innovative, other things
being equal, than one composing for one voice."

At the risk of enfuriating Bob G, I still don't agree with this.
Minimalism, doing less with more, might in fact lead to more innovation:
e.g. Ornette Coleman's suppression of the piano in his 1959 quartets.  You
couldn't say that if he had had a piano cum conventional jazz changes to
work with there would have been more innovation there.  Again, it's
simplistic to think of this in quantitative terms.  After all, if I said
that a composer who worked had 101 voices to work with would automatically
have more innovative possibilities than one with 55, you would probably
think I'm crazy.  The question cannot be decided a priori, and the "ceteris
paribus" argument begs the question because nothing is ever equal after the
fact.  Maybe at one point it will be more innovative to suppress one aspect
of an art see what happens to the rest.  How about a poem that couldn't, by
definition, be represented by words on the page?  That could be more
original than a visual poem.

<< this passage from Jonathan M. is interesting... what precisely *is*

the meaning of  "innovation"...often, there is a lot of anxiety

encoded in these questions;  it rather reminds me of a couple of

years ago, when 2 very bright and excellent poets published a

dialogue, in which they agreed that (the scene, which they identified

themselves with, which they called) "avant-garde" poetry, would lose

all meaning if it became the mainstream because *its point was to be

in rebellion..*


is this true?

It is.


it strikes me that many of the poets i feel closest to, across the

country, are writing out of a sense of the possiblity of their own

work, of their own agendas..of where their writing is pointing..


they aren't precisely worried about whether they are "in rebellion"

against something.... nor (and i admit, this is a different tho

related issue) about whether they are "innovating" ..... in fact,

many find these questions uninteresting or amusing..


Yep, it can also make for some pretty funny reading.

 the poets whose work excites me the most, seem often to be keeping

their eye on the ball;  they're not too concerned with making sure

they try to be innovative...but,  it is a preoccupation that bedevils

many of us

I don't know.  Are these the poets who end up being the most innovative?
(Shit!  I promised myself I wouldn't use that word again for a long time.)
Could be.  But they do have a better chance of producing quality work, I
think.  Could be wrong.  Best, Bill

Jon, Chris, et al--I'm generally too swamped with the day to day grind of my
nasty corporate job to read list messages very carefully, but I wanted to
say that I enjoyed this posting about metaphor, metonomy, synecdoche, and
paradigmatic vs syntagmatic uses of language, not only for its inherent
interest, but because it takes me back to my college/grad school days when I
actually knew what this stuff meant.

If somebody has five seconds (okay, maybe five minutes), could you
back-channel me the basic definitions of the terms above.  It would make
interesting reading while I'm taking my half-hour lunch break at my desk
(not that I'm complaining, I've got a 42nd-storey view of lower Manhattan
from river to river.

This is true.  But Bob's statement that visual poets are necessarily more
"adventurous" than language poets predated my statement by a couple of weeks,
and we disagree.  My argument involves the major innovation of
poststructuralism which stretches across disciplines--and langpo as its
closest poetic relative.  Just tonight I was listening to one of America's
hot shot scientists on the subject of Quantum Theory.  He mentioned that
recent language centered art (vague term, but his, not mine), in his view,
has fallen from the same tree, so to speak.  How informed this guy is, I
can't say.  I tend to agree with whomever Bob is responding to, but to be
fair Bob does not contend in his most recent post that vispo is de facto more
innovative, though at times he does seem to be saying just that.  One can
argue, I think somewhat convincingly, that the more material an artist has to
work with, the more opportunities for innovation present themselves.  But of
course an opportunity is not a sufficient cause.   Frankly, I'm ready to
declare a moratorium on the term "innovation."  What did O'Hara say?  "You
just go on your nerve."  No doubt literary history will sort it all out.
Best to Bob and whomever, Bill

        Actually there is a good deal of --and ever faster growing
bodo of--very
good work done in the field knonn affectionately/half joking as "RocK Art"
which deals very seriously with things like phosphenes and shamanistic
liminal states being at the birth of the kind of gestural, painted,
vocalized, notatated work which continues to this day n the work of what
Philadelpho Menezes called "the intersign" or "intermedia".

        The very recongition by so many cultures of the liminal--not only
in states of being, in air/.warter/land/air/water/land interfaces as wekk
as "Here" and "eslewhere"  (out of the body, spiritual, ecstatic, trance,
"beside onself" etc)--

        --is a recognition of what continstitutes the intersigg, the
intermeida--

        as the notations and expressions of the liminal invlve an
interaction among the wht we now call the arts--performance, ong, dance,
notations, a "montage poem" of call and response with improvisation--

gun, spray paint can cannister as it were

        in the liminal,intermedia--the belaboured divisions of labor of
"intellect" and "emotion" are not kept seprate, but are in an intercgnae,
an exchange--

        (to indulge in a bit of cattiness--the whole notion we have now
of mixed media, mulii media,  (as Menezes points out, this is NOT

with these materials In a "critical' "theortical" "self reflexsive" etc
manner--which is why it  no w onder is is hevily supported by the
galleries, the
endowmments, committess, various journals, the academies, the grad shool
progams
--this helps create jobs and perpetute that argument re intellect/emotions
which is keeping the food on many a table and the car in many a garage
and the paper delivered at many a conference and the latest book from such
and such a press with  whole hearted endorsements of its trangressiveness

I agree with you here Bob.  I think what happens with "visual" and
"language" poetry is that a label often gets confused with a description.
Goodman has something to say about this in connection with classification
in Languages of Art.  A curious thing about a label, as he says, is that it
often effects a classification as it records one, giving the impression
that what's labeled is being, or has been, described by the label.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

A number of commentors have  hit the nail on the head--WCW realizes that just as
the vibrant, lively wide open poetry scene of the late teens and early
tewnties--with intense connections wit an interests in and influences from
modern art (teh Armory show for example, the Marcel Duchamp edited "Wrongrong"
ha, etc etc)--
        WCW realised tat just as this scene is cutting loose, old TSE hits
the Long Ball--the utlimate in his series of masterful PopSongs--and,
coupled with is statements re poetry, a new anon which is a rearrangemet of
the old as is so often   done by any movement worht is salt--remember "les
grandes tetes molles" of Surrealism for example., or some of the betes noirs
of this list--couples with all this formidable education and exptriatiion,
Eliot also announces he is turning his back not only this native tongue,
with which WCW and others are so concerned, and gives hi allegiance to te
British Language, its Church and its Crown.

        WCW as it has often been noted had more than a passing animus
towards the British--which may well have have carried over into the
betrayal
of brother Eliot of his american sisters and brethern, (think of the
mighty
work of Gertrdue Stein for example)- so intent on making something of
American life literature and language--WCW's animus came from his father, an
anglophile--i recall reading a year os or ago on the Cap-L a violent
anti-WCW attack due to his writing a poeme applauding to some degree a german
bombing of London--you caan imagine the outrage over this!--however one
person possessed of more critical balance did point out that the pome may
well have had to do with WCW's animosity to his pro_british father, as much
as anything to with the war,

        In retrospect, Williams was not wrong in his judgement of the
effect of Eliot's not only poetry but his prononciementos regarding poetry
and his views on the profession of poetry, and as well is relation with
langauge, State and power/poetics.

        One of his quirkier insights thought among his earlier essays is his
interest in popular culture--esp the British musical hall.

        I think one of WCW's lasting fears with the Eliot--New Criticism
lines of developement in american poetry was te eschewing o ways he saw of
such importance--the influenecs of modern painting, of he radio, advertising,
documents--hence his place I beleive in the Pound-Williams-Paul Mectalf line
connect with, interested n and influenced by hieroglphys, various forms of
notations (jottings on the run, calligraphies, the uses of the type
writer and other new technologies--the interest in paining, music, dance,
history, the use of quotation, the attention with the conrete and as well
the heard--

        "A poem can be made of anything" WCW asserted--and demonstrated--

        and as Robert Grenier posed the question in a Talk at Franconia in
a 1997 edition of :that:--

        in what  way s can we work with the proposition in the earlier wcw
(SPRiNG AND ALL  for example) and the later "no ideas but in things/mr"
from
PATTERSON-- )

        not as either/or" but as "both/and"

         think that Grenier is indicating how much still remains open in
the
works of the early american modernists--how much was not shut down by
Eliot and the Formalists of our times . . .

        Grenier's own work and its reception my be seen as part of that
long line of work held at bay by the Eliot influence . . .

        a final anecdote, from an interview in ROBERT SMITHSSN'S COLLECTED
WRITINGS:  Smithson is recounting his vist as very young unknown painter
to
the home of WCW--a pilgrammge made by so many  young unknown arists and
poets and eidtors of itte mags in search of at east a ittle blurb from the
Master--
for some many decades to the himelf until late in life largely unknown
WCW--Smithson was accompnied by his friend the poet Irving Latyon--at one
point WCW remakred to Smithson how much he always enjoyed the disucsssions
with painters, all his life . . . far mre than those wth poets . . .

Books cost so much anymore! This was definitely worth the outlandish 28

>It also occurred to me in reading re visual versus or plus lang poet that an implicit question was, fairly obviously (?): "what is innovative?" How do we define or identify it or the work? In fact it leads to the queastion:"What is poetry?" and "What is and can we or should we define or delineate good poetry?"
 But I think that all of those writers that have received any acclaim of whatever ilk ( although I read an interview with at at T S Eliot in which he said he was not trying to be original or "modern", it was just that the forms and languages he adopted fulfilled what he had to say.Or words to that effect.) are always aware (even if they keep it at the "back of their mind") of their need to "make it new" or to do something "special". Of course what they have to say, or the impulse in or behind their work, may create a unique style. In a sense we're all unique. Stein and cummimgs were quite distinct (from certain others who had preceded them). But to what extent does that come from preconception? Less so than say the Language Poets. W C Williams, Olson adn Creeley seem to be deliberate "innovators" but Creeley's poems (in a sense like all poems) have a powerful "inner message" an almost abstract quality (hence that - his own "voice" seems to be his originality more than the  "p
 rojective" process even if that too is important. The  formal or constructive aspects are more significant in Olson's "Maximus" but even in that work (admitted,y in hindsight) one feels the big presence of Olson himself. What happens is that the two kinds of innovation (or conscious uniqueness) become inter-mixed. Pure experiment just to be "in rebellion" is or can be pointless. The writer needs some "raison d'etre" but I dont therefore imply that the poetry of say Coolidge of "Polarod" is thus meaningles. I find that a powerful work. It gives me  a different challenge or pleasure from  some of the say extraordinary and often very funny poems (mixed with a kind of aometimes "dark" underspeak) of James Tate or even someone more "mainstream". Probably the solution for a writer is to study and learn from the history of his craft, be as well informed (in all ares as well as current lit theory) as possible and then to let "instinct" take over - or "negative capability".
 Another thing which may seem obscure and may have gone unnoticed: John Ashbert's regret (in an interview)
was that he'd never learnt to compose music. I think this gives a clue to the way certain creative writers work.
  So maybe here's something worth considering here.I'm a bit tired tonight so maybe this might sound a bit disjointed. Anyway, that's my take on things for now. All the best, Richard.

Hi Arielle--that's a great project. The edition I have is just called
Tristan Corbiere / Poems, trans. Walter McElroy, The Banyan Press, 1947. I
thought it was a pretty damn good job. He tries to get the tone w/o losing
the rhyme. Here's a stanza from La Fin/The End, about death at sea:

--Pas de fond de six pieds, ni rats de cimetiere:
Eux ils vont aux requins! L'ame d'un matelot,
Au lieu de suinter dans vos pommes de terre
        Respire a chaque flot.

For them no graveyard rats, no six feet of sod:
They go to the sharks! Not for the mariner's soul
To ooze into your potatoes beneath the clod:
        It breathes from the sea's roll.

Anyway, good luck, & maybe you could post one of your translations to the
list, or send me a copy. Thanks, Sylvester

David. I found your "explanation" of visual poetry very interesting. =

pretentious anyway) but a sort of conceptual thing I'm doing (or I'm =
"suppoosed" to be doing) called The Infinite Poem which began as an =
attempt to introduce a multi rather than a monological work inresponse =
to an essay by Charles Bernstein in "the American Tree" . My "tactics" =
include (initially) taking quotes, either randomly or "deliberately" =
from writers and texts of many kinds and seeing how they interacted. So =
I had a quote from Billy Bathgate juxtaposed with art writing then =
childrens or scientific. Part of it was published. I was interested at =
that time in the interaction of "languages" as I called them and not so =
much with the significance of the actual "quotes" (I rarely identify =
them). Potentially all media were to be brought into the work or =
project. Also the idea was that "meanings" were or could be (by the =
reader) generated and regenerated. Much as one can see meanings (so =
called) in the interactions of a so-called  abstract painting. (I'm not =
certain that ther's such a thing).But then I started wondering what the =
hell I was doing, or why. I actually started doing drawings (in colour =
or black and white)in the "work". Potentially, anything could go in. =
But, as I say, I didnt see any point in it. (After all, if one "puts =
everything in" its the same as "leaving everything out" as Ashbery says =
(not quite in those words (but in Three Poems)). So I was sort of =
stalemated or zugwanged (in Chess where every move leads one inevitably =
to disaster, trust me, this computer beats me every day!). But your idea =
or reference to something that is not "fixed" was actually my next step =
(predated by Stein I know)(the idea of process) - it lead to me thinking =
that I didnt need to know what I was doing per se. And I didnt even need =
to have an actual poem or work - just the idea of it. And the poem could =
react itself to its own internal "meaning generators" (which were =
"alive" and interacting like living molecules) to produce further =
meanings. Another thing that I was interested in was that I often found =
that the whole series of drafts to a poem (not the "finished" poem) were =
often more interesting to me than the so-called finished poem.(Of say =
another writer).The poem doesnt start or stop anywhere.There's a lot =
more, but ultimately the poem gets to write me out. It then becomes The =
Infinite Authorless Poem (just use this to catch peoples' attention). =
Then shorten this to The Project or Game or something. And now everyone =
starts partaking. But in a sense I'd probably "discovered" that life =
itself is a poem. Also the idea was for everyone to be able to =
participate - potentially. A lot of the writers you indicated have =
influenced my thinking. Of course Mallarme,and Olson,Pound,Stein. But =
also I had in mind a New Zealand artist poet called Len Lye who made =
films (he also wrote poems,there was an exhibit of his works at the =
Pompidou Centre this year).Also I had been reading the ideas of =
contemporary musicians including Cage and Ives. Ives biog.Interested me =
and his desire to do a Universal Symphony. So I've moved from a =
"meaningless" random thing that is a kind of "investigation" to some =
sort of participatory thing involving evrything ang everyone. At which =
point I started to think the whole thing should best remain an idea! But =
around Auckland quite a lot of people keep asking me how my Infinte Poem =
is going! So maybe I'll keep it as a "perpetual possibility" (is that =
Eliot?). This will preempt or checkmate anyone else trying to go one =
better because it becomes a kind of homage to "Catch 22"!  An =
interesting thing I found though was that it was nearly impossible to do =
an unemotive, "meaningless" poem. The initial thing that I published - =
despite its aleatory nature - seemed to have a kind of "beat" overall. =
There were certain thermatic "links" and I tended to "choose" quotes =
that, especially when juxtaposed with quite different writing, generated =
quite a powerful emotive effect.So perhaps that was "original". I'll try =
to put bits of it on a separate email (without this long commentary). I =
think that it differs from so-called LangPo in that my own "voice" still =
came into the poem, if that's what it can be called.
   As well as that I write shorter poems that are vaguely Asberic and =
other "language" or "drier" and perhaps quieter (but still there's a =
kind of emotive force behind the words I think) experiments. Thir =
justification is that I like doing them. In fact, I cant think of any =
ither reason for writing: I cant see the point of "teaching" or =
"informing". Who am I to teach? People just want to enjoy things (at =
whatever "level"). Rather than a love of labour, a labour of love. =
Yours, garrullousally, Richard Z Taylor.P.S. Another "influence" was my =
reading of Davisd Antin's "talk poems" which I found fascinating.=20

Brent,  Thank you for your thoughtful & terrifically intelligent engagement
w/ my previous post.  But coherency is really the last thing you should
accuse me of.

About defining beauty--you're absolutely right--I'm not interested in that at
all.  Adjudicating the beautiful strikes me as merely a form, either, of
policing the reader's response or of doggy intramural scent-marking.  "Bad
taste" doesn't make me nervous at all.  Everybody's different--let's get used
to it.  & forgive me for not defining beauty myself, but I think of the
beautiful as a verb rather than as a noun.  It's an experience, as Louise
Bourgeois describes it, that we project back onto the object.

Dissing LangPo was also about the furthest thing from my mind.  Charles
Bernstein is appallingly smart about both the resistance to marketplace
values and the ways in which radical *content* reinforces dominant
ideologies.  However, it's a critique that is now almost 30 yrs old and every
radical strategy has, I think, a conservative component that emerges in time.
 Strictly formal innovation strikes me, today, in fact, as having an appeal
almost exclusively to a specialist audience which is already in abstract
agreement w/ whatever political values the work advocates.  (Of course, this
line of thinking also carries w/ it all of the stupid baggage--that I'd like
to avoid-- of judging a poem merely by what is *radical* about it.)  So here
is my point again, put in a slightly different way:  what is most challenging
about artistic work occurs *before* its recognition.  Believe me, more power
to the LangPos who manage to get endowed chairs etc., but that scene is
definitively over--it's just "spectator-food" now--either consumed or
critiqued--as evidenced by posts announcing on Poetics that, say, Fanny Howe
has received a decent review in the _Times_.  The truth is, it means a lot
less than it would have 20 yrs ago, but to a lot more people.

All of which is to raise another issue re experimentalist poetics--that the
effect or sensation of verbal disjunction can become the basis for a
conscious criticality.  The answer seems, to me, emphatically NO.  Our
projections strike me, instead, as being entirely solitary and can't be
directed or controlled to conform to our political fantasies--except in the
way we (us avant-gardist's) tend to review each other's books.  All of our
beautiful sociability, our concern for community, results in a *politeness*
that I often feel as stupidly deadening.

Beauty, I wanted to say, is a vernacular that extends beyond the
claustrophobia of the poetry world.  When I do readings now, instead of
reading live, I bring tapes of poems I've made of myself reading to &
soliciting responses from people I've called at random & recorded on the
phone--usually people at work in tanning salons, prisons, pet shops, etc.
Believe me, these people know all about the permisson poetry is given to
refuse, scandalize, & insult the doxa.  So, the denigration of content--or at
least of any content that isn't really formal or nonsemantic--strikes me as
simply one more lazy, reflexive habit that needs to be interrogated.

--Jacques (w/ apologies, as always, for my digressiveness)

Subject:      Jakobson on Metonymy & Metaphor
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Bravo to Jonathan Mayhew for:

"Jakobson I think made the first mistake by seeing metaphor and metonymy
as polar opposites…  As a result of Jakobson and Lacan, noone seems to
know what metonymy is.  That is, they make it into some abstract master
trope rather than thinking of real cases of metonymy and how they
function...  I am constantly coming across really basic mistakes in
people who should know better… It makes me think my entire discipline of
literary criticism is built on quicksand."

The venerable aureole that always surrounds the name of Jakobson in
poetics circles is something of a mystery to me.  In his writing on
semantics he does little more than cobble other people’s ideas together
with his gross misunderstandings of technical terms (e.g.
‘metalanguage’) and utterly banal, though questionable, ‘commonsense’
models of the way language works (e.g. language as an exchange of
‘messages’).  I have yet to run into anything I would remotely classify
as an insight in his famous later writings.  His very selective
citations of experimental work or anecdotal evidence are risible.

[I am sure this contention will be dismissed out of hand as the ravings
of a crank, but let me enlist the support of J. H. Prynne: in ‘Stars,
Tigers and the Shape of Words’ he mentions "the highly regarded (if also
curiously anecdotal and unrigorous) later work of Roman Jakobson" (p.
19), and in ‘China Figures’, alluding to Jakobson’s ‘Two Aspects’ paper,
he says: "The use of these figural terms [metaphor and metonymy] in
recent linguistic and structuralist analysis does not yet rest on stable
definition."  (footnote to p. 369 in ‘New Songs from a Jade Terrace’).
The word to cherish in this last is ‘yet’.  Thanks to Nate Dorward (who
may not agree with my and Prynne’s verdict on Jakobson) for providing me
with copies of these papers.]

Jakobson’s windy projection thesis ("the poetic function projects the
principle of equivalence from the axis of selection into the axis of
combination") manages to say nothing at all, simply borrowing Saussure’s
associative/syntagmatic ‘axes’ (which were tacked onto and cannot easily
be reconciled with the signifier/signified relation or the langue/parole
distinction or the ‘system of differences’ idea), buying a specious
whiff of authority with the use of a technical, ‘rigorous’ word like
‘project’, which has unearned cartographical and geometrical
connotations, among others.  It has about as much content as my dictum:
a three-course meal ‘projects’ the ‘principle of ternarity’ from the
‘axis of enumeration’ into the ‘axis of alimentation’.

The emptiness of Jakobson’s ‘rigorous distinctions’ is made quite
evident in their careless application by even some of our best critics
(Jonathan cites de Man in his original post).  Another example:
Perloff, in her ‘After Language Poetry’ essay  (on the Poetics site),
while justly slapping the wrists of an unnamed author in ‘Moving
Borders’, writes:  "Metonymy is the trope that relates one image or
phrase to another along the axis of contiguity, as in "hut," "hovel,"
"poor little house," "shack" (Jakobson's example)."  In fact, in
Jakobson’s schema, these words are arrayed along the axis of
selection/association, waiting to be slotted into some
noun-phrase-place-holder in some complex expression on the axis of
contiguity.  But the point is: who cares?  The amount of real
analytical, critical or theoretical work done by these bogus
distinctions is exiguous anyway.

Water-shedding


Shedding water / holding it back / in abeyance / closing the loopholes.

For the past two weeks I have been burning cdroms of my work of the past
six years; I began with the version I did for a group in Atlanta (that I
abandoned) - con/text/sub 1.0. This has led to sub/con/text - the current
and final title - versions 2.01, 2.02, 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.2, and
2.3. The earlier ones were organizations and reorganizations; the later -
2.2 and 2.3 are the result of opening up other, older, computers I have
here, and re-editing a number of texts and files. The directory structure
- for such it is - is a tree structure, which has remained pretty coherent
through most of the history of computing; the root leads to /cdrom/ - at
which point, the directory tree and file trees are reproduced; the various
directories are given; there is a readme first text; and there is an
index.html opening file if one is entering through a browser.

Most of the time, all of this has had to be tuned and retuned; in other
words, I have been tuning and retuning six years' worth of work - as well
as another 20 or so essays from the 1980s and early 90s. There are some
parts of the Internet Text as well (found within the /cdrom/network direc-
tory) that go back to the late sixties.

I worry that all of this is a tomb, in a way; it contains most of my work
I've considered valuable over the past few decades. Odd things such as my
Structure of Reality - with its numerous diagrams and ruminations on
threshold logics - aren't reproduced, but there are descriptions of them
in the Internet Text as well. The three older records (two of which were
reissued as cds) aren't included; the films aren't included; and only very
recent video segments are found on it. None of the work from my post-
industrial group Damaged Life is on it.

But the writing is there, in all fullness, and in the /cdrom/program di-
rectory are numerous programs exploring some of the fractal measure-geom-
etries I discovered (I'm sure not originally), for anyone with qbasic.exe
installed to play with. And there is _some_ music, including electric gui-
tar, which has been a major interest for years, and shakuhachi, which I
have been working intensely with, for the past few. Meanwhile, there are
all those graphics - the /cdrom/image directory alone has close to 380 -
which form a universe by themselves, resonating with the texts, wrapping
themselves around each other and the viewer as well.

All of which is to say, the watershed. I've been relieved that my work
stands a chance of surviving - the disks holds a great deal of work that
is not on line for example - in one or another form, that it might be
rediscovered sometime in the future. It's oddly supported now - I haven't
done a "real" book since Station Hill took me on in 1984 (Disorders of the
Real, 1988) - only magazine and book anthologies, e-venues, etc. So I hope
that the electronic venue of the cdrom will hold for at least twenty years
or so, at least on antique computers, and that I will, or someone will, be
able to update the materials, reconfigure them, in the latest incarnation
of mass storage devices.

There are issues for me of the phenomenology of the disk; the latest
copies have a colored label on the disk itself, instead of bleak black and
white - and somehow the whole seems more permanent. And a fair number of
them, in one or another version, have been distributed. Nonetheless, a lot
of people I would want to have them just haven't been interested - and I
ascribe this to - no matter how much the opposite is claimed - an intrans-
igent attachment to the _book_ - something I also feel. It's as if the
cdrom can only be a _project,_ or _resource_ - but nothing that carries
the weight or intimacy of the book - nothing, in short, that is _desirab-
le,_ in terms of personal ownership. The relationships and gaps between
computer and language are still labeled as "experimental," in spite of
years of development (my own first computer works were from 1971 for ex-
ample).

I know the value of my work; I hold onto it like a hungry ghost that's
forbidden sleep or recompense, that wanders, devours everywhere. I get
nourishment back-channel which keeps me going, and I'm happy that those
people who do want the disks are world-wide (in spite of the postage). But
there are times I'm overwhelmed by the massivity, by a theory-thicket so
large that it literally borders on substance. I've noted with relief that
people tend to find the disks easy to navigate and explore (which is what
I intended), and I've thought that this might lead further to the idea
that there are language/image worlds opening up through this - that a kind
of intimacy may result after all. But the activity is very different; like
hypertext, it asks a lot of a reader, a kind of mobility he or she might
not be comfortable with.

It's odd to roam across the six years. They cover periods of intense dep-
ression, of my mother's death, of my successes and failures as list moder-
ator, as a writer inspired by such disparate sources as Donald Knuth, old
Akkadian, linux, contemporary Japan, and Jabes. Nikuko, Jennifer, Doctor
Leopold Konninger, Travis, Clara, Honey, Alan, and Julu come and go; there
are explorations of MOOs, netsex, protocols, and the very early history of
the Net. Different venues (editing an issue of New Observations on Cul-
tures of Internet, and the Lusitania Book, Being on Line; putting together
the chapbooks for the parables and The Case of the Real; etc.) produce
warps into the fabric, texts tending towards momentary completions (36 new
parables for example), images carried to extremes and exhaustion (work
with Blender for example). I tried all through the work to keep up both
intensity and resonance, as if each piece were my last (which is something
always haunting me, dreams of death without recompense or memory). I think
for the most part I succeeded, sometimes too well; there are sections of
the diary and the Internet Text that I can read only with difficulty at
this point. I wonder if this comes through, hoping that resonance will
carry through (each text, as if within Indra's net, resonating with, and
signaling, every other).

And all this fits on a single, distributable disk, finally reaching a pla-
teau of organization that _makes sense_ to me, carries a certain weight.

I find myself less able to sleep, feeling more physically ill, but as if
something were taken care of, taken account of - as if something unaccoun-
table and unaccounted for, were, nonetheless, subject to a form of tally.
So that my writings now, in a sense, are "beyond the disk," oddly cooled,
in a period of hiatus, as I wonder if the disk will be understood, if that
even matters, and as I work on distribution. (There are copies still
available, of the newer 2.2 and 2.3, through Alan Sondheim, 432 Dean St.,
Brooklyn, NY, 11217, $14 in any form. End of advertisement.) I find myself
spending more time within the languorous temporality of the burner, nap-
ping between finished disks popping out on this slow machine. I've burned
three copies of music cds as well - The Blue Humans, and the two old LPs
that were reissued a few years ago as cds - for backup. I've backed up all
my usual miscellaneous files and programs and teaching materials. It's as
if I could close up shop. It's as if a kind of work is completed.

It's a watershed and water shed - somewhere I'm beneath or elsewhere than
all of this, protocols splashing from my body; I'm down deep, inviolate;
I'm vulnerable, always in league with death.

Dear Arielle:

        best place to start as always is in libraries bibliographies of
books etc

        one quick suggestion--I'll try to dig up some things here that may
be of use to you as also love Corbiere's work, but have only read it in
French s w be most interested in yr translations--)--one quick route might be
to look into the well known influence both Corbiere and Laforgue had on
T.S.. Eliot--this route may well lead you to some interesting
references, researches, translations,commentaries etc--and perhaps
something in TSE's or one of his correspondents' letters re a discussion of
Corbiere--

        also, it has been abt thirty years since i read it but you might
want to check for example Arthur Symons' classic book on the French
Symbolists--which if some part of my mangled memory serves, may lead you
to some
interesting references and further routes to research--as Symons was
actually hanging out in Paris during and amongst the peripheries of "la
Belle
Epoque" so had access to some interesting though some claim not always
reliable information and insights regarding that crowd--

        (as I recall, again forgive my memory of books read so long ago
that I can't say for certain)--but as I recall Symons' book had quite an
influence on TSE and helped  lead him Corbiere-ward--

        alos am sure if you check both the texts but perhpas even more
importantly thei bibliographies dealing with Eliot's works you may well
find some ineterestig paths leading to Corbiere

        also I know from tryly vague memory that there have been several
short studies of influence of Corbiere on not only Eliot but the
development and use of slang and irony in much modernist poetry in both
french and english poetry--in english often due of course to that Great
Arbiter for so long of tastes, talents, traditions and so on, TSE--

        (when i first started reading Corbiere in my teens and was at same
time also a 'Dylan-freak"--my father suggested that Corbiere was in a way
an
influence on Dylan, via Eliot and the use of slang and so on that Corbiere
introduced, along with Laforgue--into much modern english and french
poetry--i think one could make an interesting study of the
interrelationships of Laforgue's vers libres, combining seemingly trivial
things and events with chains of associations of ideas and images--with
the works of
Frank O'Hara--some one must have done this i wd imagine?)

        (I have often thought of especially the early Eliot as a lyricist
of pop songs--and indeed he did write a rather affecting little essay on
the british music hall and a popular and adored singer of the times . . .)

        I'll rummage through some of my other sources here and there and
see what else I can come up with as your project I think is an exciting
and valuable one--and challenging!--so all my best and I'll set to
sleuthing--

        but do think the TSE connection might lead you to some interesting
finds--

Bio/Bibliographical Profiles

JAY WRIGHT was born in New Mexico in 1935 and is the author of eight books
of poems, including Selected Poems (1987) and Boleros (1991).  His
Transfigurations: Collected Poems is due from Louisiana State UP later this
fall.  Wright was the 1996 recipient of the Chancellors of the Academy of
American Poets fellowship for distinguished achievement.  His numerous
awards include MacArthur, Rockefeller, and Guggenheim Fellowships and an
American Academy of Arts and Letters Literary Award.

JAYNE CORTEZ was born in Arizona in 1936 and published her first collection
of poetry in 1969.  She is the author of Festivals and Funerals (1971),
Scarifications (1973), Firespitter (1982), Coagulations: New and Selected
Poems (1984), and Somewhere in Advance of Nowhere (1996).  She has also
recorded six CDs with her band The Firespitters, including Cheerful &
Optimistic, Taking the Blues Back Home, and Find Your Own Voice.  Cortez's
widely-translated works have earned her numerous awards, including NEA and
New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowships, the International African
=46estival Award, and an American Book Award.  She is one of the directors o=
f
the Organization of Women Writers of Africa.

BRIAN KIM STEFANS was born in 1969 and is the author of Free Space Comix
(1998), Gulf (1998), and Angry Penguins (2000).  He is the editor of Arras
magazine, which after three print issues shifted to the world wide web in
1998.  An active presence in the New York poetry community, Stefans has
recently performed his works in San Francisco, Philadelphia, and London.

ROD SMITH was born in 1962 and makes his home in Washington D.C., where he
manages Bridge Street Books.  He is the author of The Boy Poems (1993), In
Memory of My Theories (1996), and Protective Immediacy (1999).  He is the
editor of Aerial magazine (founded in 1984) and publisher of Edge books.

KATHLEEN FRASER was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1935 and has lived for
extended periods in New York, San Francisco, and Rome.  She is the author
of fourteen books of poetry, including Change of Address (1966), Magritte
Series (1977), and when new time folds up (1993).  In 1997, Wesleyan
University Press published her Selected Poems 1970-1995 under the title Il
Cuore: The Heart.  Fraser has inspired generations of young writers as a
teacher in the San Francisco State University Creative Writing Program
(1972-1992) and has been an influential voice in feminist scholarship as
editor and essayist.  Her visionary journal HOW(ever) (1983-1991) recently
transformed itself into the web-site HOW2 and her essays are now available
for the first time in one collection, Translating the Unspeakable: Poetry
and the Innovative Necessity.

ROBERT GRENIER was born in 1942 and began publishing poetry in the
mid-1960s.  His works include Sentences (1978), A Day at the Beach (1985),
and Phantom Anthems (1986).  He was the founding co-editor of the
influential journal This from 1971-1974.  Since the early 1990s, Grenier
been working increasingly at what some have called "illuminated poems,"
texts whose carefully wrought singularity does not easily tranpose to the
print medium.  Such works--disseminated mainly through the web and in
photographic slide format--include owl/on/bou/gh (1997) and r h y m m s
(forthcoming).

JOANNE KYGER was born in 1934, lives in Bolinas, California, and has
published 15 books of poetry, including Going On: Selected Poems 1958-1980
(1983) and Just Space: Poems 1979-1989 (1991). Her Japan and India
Journals: 1960-1964 (1981) record the seismic shift in attention from
western to eastern modes of living, writing, and thinking which absorbed
Kyger and her generation of poets in the early 1960s. Her diaries are also
an important social document, providing keen portraits of significant
literary figures like Gary Snyder, Allen Ginsberg and Clayton Eshleman. Her
poetry's wise humor, sharpness of intellect and unobtrusive responsibility
to craft have influenced such later writers as Alice Notley, Robert
Grenier, and Ron Silliman.

ELAINE EQUI was born in 1953 and is the author of a half dozen books,
including Accessories (1988), Decoy (1994), and Voice-Over (1999).  She is
a Senior Editor at the journal Conjunctions and a member of the New School
and City College faculties.  Her work has been featured in the Best
American Poetry anthologies of 1989 and 1995, as well as in the Norton
Anthology of Postmodern Poetry.

LORENZO THOMAS was born in 1944 and presently lives and teaches in Houston.
As a member of the Umbra workshop in the 1960s, Thomas helped shape the
terms of the emerging Black Arts Movement.  His publications include
Chances are Few (1979), The Bathers (1981), and Sound Science (1992).
Thomas's groundbreaking book of scholarship, Extraordinary Measures:
Afrocentric Modernism and 20th-Century American Poetry was published
earlier this year by the University of Alabama Press.

Kathleen Fraser's most recent books include il cuore: the heart, Selected
Poems 1970-1995 (Wesleyan University Press, 1997), and WING  (Em Press,
1995). Her book of essays, TRANSLATING THE UNSPEAKABLE, Poetry and the
Innovative Necessity, was published in the spring of 2000 by the University
of Alabama Press [Modern and Contemporary Poetics Series]. Fraser publishes
and edits the on-line journal How2
<www.departments.bucknell.edu/stadler_center/how2>, an electronic extension
of the '80s journal HOW(ever), focusing on innovative writing and scholarship
by contemporary and modernist women writers. Her new chapbook from a+bend
press is 20th Century.

Poet and translator Cole Swensen directs the creative writing program and
teaches literature and poetry at the University of Denver in Colorado. Recent
books include Try (University of Iowa, 1999), Noon (Sun & Moon, 1997), and
Numen (Burning Deck, 1995). Forthcoming books include Oh (Apogee Press) and
Such Rich Hour (University of Iowa). She serves as the translation editor of
the on-line journal How2, and she is active as a translator of contemporary
French poetry, fiction, and art criticism. Recent published translations
include Olivier Cadiot's Art Poetic and Pierre Alferi's Natural Gaits, both
from Sun & Moon. Her newest chapbook is And Hand (a+bend press, 2000).

I was glad to see the article on Darger, and thrilled to know a new book
is coming out.  In response to the "eech" comment, well, reserve judgement
till you see the work.  As far as I know, Darger never hurt anyone, and
some amazing art has come from repressed pedophiles.  I'm obviously not
condoning crimes against children, but people's internal fantasy lives
don't really hurt anyone, and I do think that works of art should be
judged on their own merits.

All of this is just to say that I love Darger's work -- both his paintings
and his writing are stunning -- and I am so glad to see them brought to
light.

A sort of "starting" point for the move that lead ont to or through the objectivists,the projectivists and the N.Y. school.Or perhaps a reference point etc. However please dont (i.e. the Poetics List) send this on if you feel someone might object or it contravenes your policy.It is a "commercial" so I will respect your discretion. Yours faithfully, Richard Taylor.

What for what emtaphotic phoric choric rock that dums and hums itself in or
inside a metonoymic metronome whose clocking-drone and unhanded
ticklingtick
drives mad the loud rambonic biorythmic bomb until a new

has now gone cataphonic wallic in its nightmare room of song.
And this doth put me in the think of what if this is this and what  if that
is that,

Not there would have, but that there could have.  Because then he
could have done all he did without the piano AND done something
innovative WITH the piano in an added section--which would have
resulted in the further innovation of the suppressed piano parts acting
with/against the piano parts.

A problem with considering suppressed material in an art is, for me,
that suppressing material is a form of using it.  That is, an art
contains certain elements, so to not use one is innovative, but
depends for its effect on its reference to something ordinarily used.
So I'm not sure we could say that minimalism reduces the elements
of an art.

No.  He WOULD have more innovative possibilities if he really
had 101 voices to work with.  There would be a law of diminishing
returns, I suspect, inasmuch as the human ear probably isn't
capable of distinguishing 101 different voices.  If it is, then
you have the problem of the possibility of too much innovation (I
don't believe innovation is always good, even effective innovation).

I don't follow.  A poem is, by definition, words, so it can't not be
represented by words on the page.

No, because a visual poem could, by definition, not be represented by
words on the page OR by graphic elements on the page, which would make
it capable of twice the innovativeness of the wordless poem.

Mathews' _Selected Declarations of Dependence_ is a remarkable example of
the possibilities of very limited material.

Clearly opportunity is not sufficient, absolutely.  Is it even necessary?
In a sense yes and no, for opportunity can be made from even empty space.
So, there opportunity is, and isn't.  Just go on your nerve, yes.  And time
will surely tell us something.  And even after we time whispers in our ears
it will one day all become dust.  A friend recommended to me recently that I
should spend more time looking at the stars and the dark in between.

This is true.  But Bob's statement that visual poets are necessarily more
"adventurous" than language poets predated my statement by a couple of
weeks,
and we disagree.  My argument involves the major innovation of
poststructuralism which stretches across disciplines--and langpo as its
closest poetic relative.  Just tonight I was listening to one of America's
hot shot scientists on the subject of Quantum Theory.  He mentioned that
recent language centered art (vague term, but his, not mine), in his view,
has fallen from the same tree, so to speak.  How informed this guy is, I
can't say.  I tend to agree with whomever Bob is responding to, but to be
fair Bob does not contend in his most recent post that vispo is de facto
more
innovative, though at times he does seem to be saying just that.  One can
argue, I think somewhat convincingly, that the more material an artist has
to
work with, the more opportunities for innovation present themselves.  But of
course an opportunity is not a sufficient cause.   Frankly, I'm ready to

translation!) it was clearly a new poem.  Anyway, there were applications
that do language translation.  Part of the fun is the sloppiness and the
reduction of what you are left to work with at the end.  And the process is
fascinating too.  Maybe that's at least a partial avenue for you.  I don't
exactly know the full reach of these tools, so I would doubt such tools are
available for, say, Esperanto.  but I wouldn't exactly be startled if there
were one.

Incidentally, Oasis recently published this piece of mine in his Broadside
Series.  To plug what great work Stephen Ellis has done with these
broadsides, recently I've some very good ones by Arielle Greenberg,  Sheila
Murphy, Gary Sullivan, Nada Gordon, Allen Bramhall, and many others.  You
can reach Stephen at stepellis@hotmail.com I think.  His Broadsides Series
is an amazing resource for poetry, in terms of price and scope and depth.
They're only $2 a piece.

I am looking for people to help me translate my
poems from English to French, then French to
German, then German to Esperanto, then Esperanto
to Basque, Basque to Persian, then Persian to
Swahili, from Swahili to Navajo, then Navajo to
Dutch and Yiddish and back to English again.

If someone would be willing I would then like to
translate this into American Sign Language.
I suspect that this will be a more ambitious
project than the King's Jame Bible, or even the
now famous, but long forgotten, task of
translating The Celestine Prophecies to Ebonics.

Of course, I expect the finished version of my
poems to wind up in more hotel rooms than The
King Jame's Bible.

I will of course require at least 20 near-sighted
linguistics experts, and though the pay is low,
which is to say non-existent, I believe the
finished work will be of such a grand nature that
merely having one's name attached to it will
ensure one's place in the Pantheon of Literary
Giants.

Thank you, and good night.

"But Bob's statement that visual poets are necessarily more
'adventurous' than language poets predated my statement by a couple of
weeks, and we disagree. My argument involves the major innovation of
poststructuralism which stretches across disciplines--and langpo as its
closest poetic relative."   Bill Austin

I'm always struck -- and the Ubu site would be my case in point -- by how
much visual and sound poetry is really antiquarian in much the same way that
people who only write in sonnets or haiku are. The next time somebody
invents a new sound, I want to hear it.

One of the curious fates of poetic form is that once a genre has become
identified, it goes on forever even as the social context that led to it
dissolves into the fabric of time. If the literary devices that have been
associated with langpo catch on, it will suffer the same fate, so it's not
ultimately a question of who has a better form. Rather, it is how one
approaches the world and what currently exists. Most vizpo would rather look
adventurous rather than be adventurous. Ditto the sonic set.

But I frankly see little in the way of connection between post-structuralism
and langpo other than temporal proximity. Most of langpo's instincts have
been neo-structural, it would seem to me.

Hlothhere, Eadric, Wihred, and Ine


"Hey, if you walk off with that cup and we're all drinking here, pay up a
shilling and twelve to the king!"

"But ah'ulab! If you walk out of here with a bit of bloodshed, watch
out! Give the king 50 shilling, and do something or other for the host."

The host: "I don't care what she gives me. I just want something or other.
It's been a rough night, what with the drinking and all."

The king: "You shouldn't have taken out that weapon! Now give 12 shillings
to me and one to the host. You'll feel better in the morning. Put that
away!"

"Now let's go somewhere really neat! If you're sacrificing to the devils -
I don't care what kind of sacrifice - and your wife doesn't know this,
you've got to turn over just about everything! And that's not all - just
wait! You've got to give healsfang as well - another 120 shillings!
Ah'ulab! Where are you going to get all that?"

Host: "It's terrific though if you're a slave! Just pay six shillings and
sacrifice to all the devils you want! You might be flogged, but that's a
small price to pay!"

Slave: "Anything but this, I really don't want to be flogged! I promise to
be good, I won't sacrifice to the devils any more! I promise, I promise!
Look, I'm sweating!"

Host: "Well, we could always fuck of course. But then we'd have to give it
all up or be kicked out of the church."

Slave: "We could start a church of our own!"

Host: "We'd have to get a really big building!"

King: "Not if I have anything to do with it!"

Host: "We might have to fight, and if anyone fights in the palace, he's
got to give up everything and the king decides whether he lives or dies!"

King: "That's me as well! Now I don't know what to do! A'hulabi! I'll have
to give up everything to the luscious slave! She'll be my master! That
sounds excellent!"

"If you guys continue fighting and drinking, I'll be really patient and
you'll owe me 30 shillings."

Slave: "It's worth it! This is really great!"

"Hey, we're wandering way off the track here, but we're shouting and
blowing horns and making noise in all sorts of ways, so we don't have to
be killed or redeemed!"

Host: "I promise not to fight in the castle!"

Hey, no common sense allowed!  My hat is off to Mr. Taylor for his fearless
appeal to about seven or eight volatile presumptions in one sentence, all of
which I heartily embrace, with the exception of the limiting use of the
masculine pronoun.

Negative capability is one of my favorite theoretical spooks.  The term has
been so roundly rejected & ridiculed, but I can't help feeling that there's
a lot there that can still be teased out in terms of describing what happens
in poetry, etc.

I am uttterly mystified by the turn that this thread on metaphor & metonymy
has taken.  Some members of this list seem to use these terms as weapons in
their petty literary wars.  Others feel compelled to put Jakobson in his
place, back there with dead-end structuralism, etc.

I've been reading Jakobson for the past 20 years, not just the trendy stuff
on poetics and semiotics and the stuff on art in that popular poetics
collection published by Harvard Univ. Press and that poets feel obliged to
cite if not read, but also the techie stuff on phonology, distinctive
features, the linguistic mark, the origins and development of Indo-European
metrics, linguistic typology, linguistic aphasia, the concept of linguistic
zero, shifters, etc etc etc.

There is not one person on this list, not one, who comes even close to having
the range and depth of insight into the operations of language in us that
Jakobson had.

So he's been dead for nearly twenty years.  He was fallible, like the Pope
and Charles Bernstein.  Some of his last work was a re-hash of earlier work.
Okay.

Time to carve him up, I guess.

Absolutely pathetic.

*******************************

LEE ANN BROWN'S full-length book _Polyverse_ (Sun & Moon, 1999) won the New
American Poetry Series Competition.  She has performed her poetry and shown
her films internationally and has received numerous writing fellowships,
including the New York Foundation for the Arts and The MacDowell Colony.
Her poetry has been widely published in anthologies and journals.  Patrick
Pritchett calls _Polyverse_ "the most entertaining book of poetry I've read
in years" and finds in her work "a liberating poetics of permission."

IVAN ARGUELLES' most recent work is the long two-volume poem _Madonna
Septet_ (Potes & Poets Press, 2000).  His book _Looking for Mary Lou_
received the 1989 William Carlos Williams Award from the Poetry Society of
America.  Often referred to as a surrealist, his poetry goes beyond the
definition of that label.  Jake Berry calls Arguelles "a scoundrel of
cosmic proportions.  He raids the great mythic foundations of our
cognizance, east and west, and reshapes them according to the whims of his
own hyperphantasamystic muse.  He revels in the banquet of liberated soul
..."

Hey it just occured to me.....

Isn't William Slaughter the name of the character (let's say protagonist)
in Hal Hartley's
excellent underrated film TRUST?

Hey, I've been reading AIRBORNE PHOTO (stories) by Clint Burnham and
find it
a very fun (one could say poetic in its use of language....) book. I
think I like it better
than his poetry (but then again I also consider David Henderson's "SCUSE
ME WHILE I KISS THE SKY" to be one of the best epic poems of recent
years.....)
and so I figured Id plug it

plug it that is without having to get in an anti-usa jab a la Bowering's
critique of
"a lower mainland,"...

Hey George, do you really think Burnham's point in these stories is to
satirize something
Americans DO and Canadians are ABOVE?
Am I missing some canadian in-jokiness here?

Jonathan's point is excellent. What is needed in such discusions is or are
some examples. And they (critics such as Perloff - who is good in the
enthusiasm she imparts and her insights otherwise - or Jacobson ) should
define their terms very precisely. My feeling is that metaphor, beautiful as
it can be, is mostly an ornation (my word I think) while metonymy is a way
of leaping from one concept to a blast of categories. But of course that's
just obfuscation and pseudo poetry. If I say:"Here comes "Wing Nut" and I
was the bloke that used to yell that out after his courier shift, (at about
4.30 pm)I'd be meaning - rather meanly - that the nut referred to was a
personage posessing two large flanges in a sort of permanent orthogonal
excrutiation from both sides of his caput. The said gentleman, would, in
addition, be of such a phlegmatic (or perhaps a phlegmasyntagmatic) state of
seemingly paleozoic and frozen stupefaction to the degree that (one think's
of T.S's "eye" outstaring from the Protozoic slime of history's misery at
this departure)his physiognomy's (for better or worser)disposed expression
could be mistaken for a (long now) fleshless and breathless skull of a
benighted being the dimensions of whose apperceptions were or are tragically
in an exponential (and to some degree the function of the integral of the
metronyme ( or should that be the  Moogal metalogic Moon moan as described
by Jonson B.S.A.L.L 1978?Eh?) )inverse function of his faculties for, or
against, as it were, or was, or wasn't? Eh? Im? Eh?
But that wouldnt be fair. But it would at least be an example of metonymy.
Others may be able to uncover something more succinct and to the purpose
outside of the three course meal example. Dickens was a great one for
metaphors. In fact, it can be shown that any mark of any description: or
even the idea of such a mark, is a metaphor.  So in Bleak House (to take a
fairly obvious example) the fog befogs
and befouls old corroding London, and destroys, like a lethal legal spider
of penury and evil, the wicked  web
of captured and  pitifully struggling and shrieking souls, the very heart of
Goodness Itself - beside the old river Thames her self. In fact old T.S.
probably stole his "the yellow fog that rubbed across the window panes" etc
from Charles himself! Itself!
  But, seriously, joking aside. There's too much confusing and imprecise
jargon in French and German philopsophy. And what good does it all do? Is
anyone happier for Derrida or Sassure? I think they talk a lot of crap:
well, its sometimes interesting crap. But dont try and tell me that a wing
nut is anything else but a bloody wing nut. Richard Taylor.

David. I  agree overall. I'd add that Williams was the more "consciouly
innovative" writer. Or he was possessed of the future - not only the
American laguage or idiom. Eliot also somewhat seemed to want to "get into"
demotic language (see the "He do the police in..." (from Dickens) that
preceded the Waste Land before Pound excised it with one thrust of his pen),
but he was always looking back to the past: obsessed with a belief that
civilisation (or the spiritual state or whatever) had declined. So even
Pound seems more concerned than him about WW1 (as in "Hugh Selwyn Mauberly")
and the Waste Land to him is an abstract one (more or less). But Williams
creates Patterson which may have a history including both depravity and
wonderful things - but there it is (albeit as a grand metaphor as The Waste
Land is also in a way). There's a sense in the best American poetry of an
opening up, of hope, or open endedness.(one thinks of Eliot as a British
writer - I actually thought he was for years until I "encountered" W C
Williams in relatively recent times). Of course Ashbery undercuts this in
books like "A Vermont Note Book" (one of my favourites) or in his poem:
"these Lacustrines Cities" that "grew out of loathing" (there goes that
word):

         "They emerged until a tower
          controlled the sky, and with artifice dipped back
          into the past  for swans and tapering branches,
          Burning, until all that hate was transformed into useless/
          love."

But I dont see him or others of his kind as gloomy in outlook as Eliot.
Eliot, "genius" to use that overused and dubius term had his rival in the
poet of those "tapering branches". Williams would have studied Sein with
interest, bur Eliot would (I think he did) dismiss her out of hand (or come
up with some convoluted reference to Donne or Swinburne or whoever or
something in French) but Williams learnt from Pound and Stein as well as the
French writers and was probably more "in touch" with "ornery life" as well
as having a keen interest in modern art -art in general.Of course both were
influenced by surealism and probably the "irony" and humour of  la Forgue.
But Eliot tend toward a negative world view. Williams, despite his "slips"
and his sometimes angry "crankiness" seems to be trying to engage with the
extarordinary "reality that surrounds us, but also in another "reality",
that of consciousness:  "The value of the imagination to the writer
consists in its ability to make words.its unique power is to give created
forms reality,actual existence" (from "Spring and All") and as well as th
importance of imagination he writes eg. about a work of Juan Gris. Williams
is thinking about the proces of artistic creation, and of nature, and the
mind. Eliot did too somewhat but one feels he would never quite take the
risks that Williams too, or write: "...But the thing he never knows and
never dares to know is what he is at the exact moment that he is. And this
moment is the only thing in which I am interested..." Eliot may have
attempted to in "Burnt Norton" but he is al;ways more "abstract" and distant
from the reader than Williams. Regards, Richard.

Arielle, Chirot is right about Eliot, but don't forget to look in Pound
too, 8 references in Literary Essays alone, for example:
        "If Corbiere invented no process he at any rate restored French
verse to the vigour of Villon and to an intensity that no Frenchman had
touched during the intervening four centuries." (33) bonne chance,
Sylvester

hi, Ron. Without wanting to defend vizpo or sound poetry from
the charge of conservatism - for the simple reason that I know
much less about either than many of our conversants - I think
there's a troubling stasis to the account of cultural forms
you've provided here. For instance, while it would be difficult
to disagree that "once a genre has become identified, it goes
on forever even as the social context that led to it dissolves
into the fabric of time," it seems possible to say that that
persistence is not necessarily simple - that those 'same'
forms, by their persistence into differing circumstances, or
their re-appearance within a different context, can take on an
altogether different meaning and one that is not necessarily
only a reversal of their previous valence, e.g., the conservation
of what had been in some sense radically divergent from the
forms prevalent in its milieu. In this sense, it seems the
point would be less "a new sound" than the right sound at
the right time: one wouldn't want to =resurrect= Keats, but
to play Keats in the right key (read: circumstance) could be
very useful indeed. Similarly, while the apparently endless
reiteration of L=A=N=G=P=O-like techniques by, say, younger
writers not yet familiar with the scene of the 1990s does
ring out more loudly the wedding-knell for that project -
wedding it to institutions that had been its negative ground:
not to the university so much as to Literature broadly
conceived - the appearance in some contemporary work of
techniques disseminated by L=A=N=G=P=Oets may be not
repetition but something closer to citation. Obviously, the
case may be more difficult to make over the short term;
but my point isn't so much to make it with regard to any
particular exempla as to argue for the possibility of
citationality as a category of analysis, and even one that
may reside beyond subjective intention.

I'm intrigued by your assessment of L=etc. as a "neo-structural"
impulse, and this seems somehow exactly right to me, at least
with regard to the early work, L=P proper: partially characterized
by its regard only for the synchronic, its analysis of experience
as a sub-set of institutional determinations, its emphasis on and
hope for clarity in the face of ideology. If, as has recently been
claimed, L=P is a child of 60s radicalism rather than the recourse
to theory that began in the 70s - and this seems plausible, given
the lag-time for the thorough establishment in the 'States of
post-structuralist theory - it would have to occupy some position
on the axis of Structuralism-versus-Phenomenology. One might not
be too far amiss even in taking seriously the half-serious proposition
that the specific discourse of the "experimental," a term that has
become so troubling to us more recently, is the residue of an
Althusserian notion of scientificity as offering the aforementioned
clarity. It's this line of thought that has made the proximity
of The Black Tarantula/Kathy Acker to L=Poets in the Bay area
a source of surprise to me, because her mode is so other; but
perhaps in this reaction I'm over-stating the extent to which
structuralism may have been a founding assumption of the writers
in that scene.

is that it ain't Keats' idea! it's William Hazlitt's! the idea, if not the
phrase, is embedded in his _Treatise on Human Nature_.  it reads as if a
Lockean tried to explain benevolence (18th c. altruism) instead of the
state.  item:  he claims that we can be no more interested in our future
self than another's future self.  they are both equally fictional.  from
here, with a picquant turn of phrase and poetic embroidering, you might
well get n.c. but perhaps without its fatal flaw.  n.c. hides the subject
as if it is simply not a problem (and thus we get Bardolatry and still
later Keatolatry: the fantasy of the poet as everyone), while this
argument says the subject _is_ the other in some sense.  i (at least in
the future) is another.

though i am not Hazlitt expert, it is about time for his revival.
painter, biographer, critic, and, in his most peculiar moment, writer of a
cringe inducing, thinly disguised dissection of his "crush" on and
subsequent "crushing" by his landlady's daughter.  and called it "Liber
Amoris": that is, "free love."

One of the curious fates of poetic form is that once a genre has become

Helloooo Ron Silliman!  A bit surprised to read the above claim.  I assume by
"neo-structural" you mean a later version of structuralism?  a later, perhaps
more recent concern with, and manipulation of, structure?  If so, then that
is precisely how one would define poststructuralism.  Nowhere does Derrida,
for example, claim that it is possible to go beyond structure.  The one major
difference between structuralism and poststructuralism, and it is a rather
drastic one, is Derrida's exposition of structuralist bad faith, that
structuralists inadvertently privilege speech over writing (while intending
to do the opposite).  What Derrida gave us is really just a correction.  I
can't imagine that you think langpo draws a line between speech and writing,
placing the former at a higher hierarchal position (Do you?).  Langpo's
concerns seem quite different from the transparencies "spoken word" (in all
of its historical forms) .  Langpo contains speech forms, examines their
constituents, within its fascination with writing.  (The page, its set up,
its spacing, is crucial to langpo, no?)  Which is Derridean, to say the
least.  So, therefore, langpo is very much in line with the poststructuralist
project.  Not to mention conversations in L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E and Content's Dream
in which Derrida becomes the focus of some interesting analyses and
disagreements.  One may argue convincingly that langpo, theoretical as it is,
was an inevitable poetic complement to a new age of theory, a time when art
and criticism dropped their borders, exposed their intertextuality, and that
also is Derridean.  The lack of complete agreement between principles is
quite different from "little in the way of connection."  I understand the
desire to forge an independent identity, but most important aesthetic events
have been linked to strong philosophical ones, as far as I can tell.  This is
a plus, clearly.  In recent history the Romantics/German Idealists, the
Existential novelists in France (and America), Eliot's debt to, and partial
disagreement with, Bradley, Stevens and Santy, and more importantly Kant, and
on and on . . . .  A poetics linked to the Zeitgeist has a better chance of
surviving, I imagine, than those not so linked.  Langpo is no exception.
Best, Bill

Early on, Eliot began to sing the philosophical/visionary songs he then
spent a lifetime perfecting.  Like George Herbert Walker Bush, he strode
full formed into life - an adult.

something in French) but Williams learnt from Pound and Stein as well as the

French writers and was probably more "in touch" with "ornery life" as well

as having a keen interest in modern art -art in general.Of course both were

influenced by surealism and probably the "irony" and humour of  la Forgue.

But Eliot tend toward a negative world view. Williams, despite his "slips"

and his sometimes angry "crankiness" seems to be trying to engage with the

extarordinary "reality that surrounds us, but also in another "reality",

that of consciousness:  "The value of the imagination to the writer

consists in its ability to make words.its unique power is to give created

forms reality,actual existence" (from "Spring and All") and as well as th

importance of imagination he writes eg. about a work of Juan Gris. Williams

is thinking about the proces of artistic creation, and of nature, and the

mind. Eliot did too somewhat but one feels he would never quite take the

risks that Williams too, or write: "...But the thing he never knows and

never dares to know is what he is at the exact moment that he is. And this

moment is the only thing in which I am interested..." Eliot may have

attempted to in "Burnt Norton" but he is al;ways more "abstract" and distant

from the reader than Williams. Regards, Richard.

Hi Richard!  Interesting post, per usual for you.  But may I adjust a thing
or two?  Eliot did not dismiss Stein.  Quite the opposite.  He admired her
work (and that of cummings/Cummings) and asked her to submit to the
Criterion.  In typical Eliot fashion, he then sat on the submission for
several months.  Did he not like the submission?  Who knows?  More likely his
life got in the way of his work which it often did, since he sat on many
submissions from those we know he admired.  As to who was more intentionally
innovative--well, opinions are all we have, and can have.  I don't care since
I love both poets' poetry.  Who was the better poet?  Again, endless debate.
But one thing I feel safe in saying is that Eliot was in better control of
his materials than was Williams.  Paterson, Williams answer to Eliot's
anglophilia, never reaches the finish line.  Williams clearly took on more
than he could handle at the time.  I still admire what's there enormously,
even if Williams' focus drifts, and his control of his metaphors escapes him
here and there.  It's not quite fair to compare Eliot to Ashbery since they
live in different times.  Eliot's times were pretty damn gloomy--World wars
and all that.  He certainly captured the Zeitgeist.  But you're right that
Ashbery at times comments, however obliquely, on Eliot's lines.  JESUS!!  I
can't believe I'm defending T. S. !  I need a drink.  Best, Bill

ron,
     I think that perhaps your assessment of visual or sound poetry is
perhaps based on a limited view of what exists in mags founded by
adherents of these forms at a particular time.  I dont think that
someone like Menezes, for example, stopped innovating at visual or sound
poetry, if innovation is a criterion for art:
     --'I am seeing my life as part of the struggle between man and
nature.  I know there is the possibility of some sort of union.  This is
why I have been forced to take nature as my inspiration.
     Any artist who takes the 'art scene" or short sighted contemporary
history as his inspiration is turning his back on his human self.' -
Brice Marden, ca 1991.

Chris,

Always happy to provoke such a thoughtful response, even if not in agreement
as such. I really like the idea of Keats in the right key!

Bruce Andrews was at the '66 conference where Derrida, Lacan, Barthes et al
came out as posties (the papers are gathered in a good little paperback
called the Structuralist Controversy). I was reading Barthes by 1970 and one
can hardly accuse the likes of Bernstein or Watten of not paying attention
to the latest developments in theory. But I think that the contexts of
France v. the US were very different. Even at the height of 1968, very few
Americans fantasized that a revolution was immanent, whereas for the French
it very nearly happened. I think that the Habermasian formula that modernity
is an unfinished project is not the right formulation, but rather that
modernity was a project that began under faulty conditions and needs to be
reconstructed rather from the ground up.

I first knew Kathy in '72 and she was a very special person in my life for
reasons that extend beyond writing. But what she was doing with the novel as
a form is not as radically dissimilar from what Grenier, say, did with the
lyric poem.

Hope you're well,

Best,

Ron

Yeah! With you on the value of Hazlitt. At high school we had a prose
anthology we thought felt was inches away from turning into a delicatessen
contain slices of Bacon, Lamb and Hazlitt.

Isn't Liber Amoris "Book of Love" or in the light of the above, "Pound of
Love"

Deaa Richard:

        Many thanks for yr well thought out & expressed reply!

        Yes--I'd say as well that WCW is more concerned with the
future--though without naming them directly takes a swipe at the Zaum
poetry of Russian Futurism in the last page or so of SPRING AND ALL.

        WCW's "openness"--the classic Whitmanian "Song of the Open
Road"--"Open Field Poetry" later of Olson--may be seen I think quite
literally in his discussions of measure in terms of "the variable foot".

        WCW had an openess to "the common thing anonymously about us"--the
USE of this, as Creeley & Olson'd put it--a favorite line of mine from
Larry Eigner--from the prose piece "A View":  "and there for one to think
about".

        I think that gives an indication of much of WCW's work--and its
effects, what it makes of use for others--the daily world one lives
among--

        In the study of "Rock Art"--cave paintings, petroglyphs,
etc--there's a wonderful word/idea:  taphonomy.  It means the study of
things in their present state, though they may in fact be tens of
thousands of years old--one does not, as with Eliot, mourn their
fragmentation, nor attempt to put them back together again in some way, a
reorganizing of tradition as Eliot attempted.

        A frequent criticism of Americans over the years of course is just
this--their focus on the present as but a wayside to the future--and as
well their "cheerful optimism".

        In the nineteenth century, the earlier half, Americans felt
greatly lacking in ruins--made popular by British and European Romantic
and
Gothic works. Poe managed to pull off a great ltierary coup in mixing this
as both a fiction of his own, and a kind of documenting of his culture's
fixation with--ruins, death, cemeteries. (The new mode then was to buid
park-like cemetries, complete with towers, foutnains, wlaks suppied with
benchs for "contemplation" and of cours wondrous collections of trees and
flowers from around the world-- which were the leading grounds,so to
speak,  the interzones, between
city and suburb--Mount Auburn Cemenetery for example, at the edge of
Cambridge and Watertown, being an early and celebrated example.)

        (Mary Baker Eddy's tomb is in there--she even has a phone in
it--and you can try calling her. I have sevral times--but to no avail.
        Maybe she's screening her calls!)

         I think though, at the root of the American openess is actually a
very deep sense of both hope/despair being vitally contingent.

        It's in much of Whitman's writings--esp. say sections of SPECIMAN
DAYS and DEMOCRATIC VISTAS--you can find it in Emily Dickinson ("to
close
the eyes is travel")--


        Even in so bleak a novel as Faulkner's THE WILD PALMS--and few
authors have so severely cruelly doomed their male protagonist as
Faulkner has his here--the final words are :

        "between grief and nothing I will take grief".

        To me, that's a kind of song of hope amidst despair--that Eliot I
think quite frankly was afraid of.

        Eliot wanted a more comfortable, ordered world--and the 20th
century was no such a place--and America never really has been one,
despite the myth of the 1950s.  (If you think about it, since the War of
1812 the USA has been virtually at war continually for almost two hundred
years now.)

        I think it's of great importance that SPRING AND ALL is dedicated
to Charles Demuth, the great American "precisionist painter"--and as well
makes much use of a black and white repro of a Juan Gris painting--not the
painting itself--but perhaps a catalog, newspaper or magazine photo. (This
wd be the
taphonomic state of the painting--in the present in which WCW is studying
it.)

        Demuth painted with "precision" a world of new industrial
buildings--in a clear light--there's an odd sense of energy contained--the
very static compostions, the buildings for the production of
things--energy--but there's little "description" in the sense that
Creeley
writes of in "To Define"--that is, anything outside the poem, outside the
painting--yet this is what gives it its openenss--its use--that as Eigner
says it is "there for one to think about".


        Actually, I think that WCW's openness in an odd way--is closer to
an ancient world view than that of TSE's--that is: the ancient view that
the world, the universe, is generated out of chaos--that chaos is
PRODUCTIVE--a view now much taken up in science--for example Prigogine and
Stengers' great work ORDER OUT OF CHAOS.  Instead of an entropic state,
there is a negentropic one, in which a cylical in a sense wave movement
occurs in which order eventually generates chaos, and then chaos a new
order--

        as Pascal put it, "it is not the elements which are new, but the
order of their arrangement".

        I think WCW understood this, and Eliot did not--it frightned him.

        I do think Robert Grenier indicates something very profound in his
noting that what requires attention is the movement in WCW from SPRING AND
ALL's "only the imagination is real" and the later, in PATTERSON, "no
ideas
but in things, mr.".

        The proposal in Grenier is that WCW's two seemingly  opposed
statements are open to,  indicative of a both/and, not an either/or--that
in this
proposition, there is, as always, much work to be done.

        Again--to signal my agreement with yr sense of WCW's openness--
and the continual USE of his work.

        (Two additional scraps thrown into the stew:

        in TROPIC OF CANCER, Henry Miller notes with joy his realization
that he has at last escaped not only America--but that he now lives in
"a world without  hope and no despair".  Though the two are not directly
related as occuring in the same moment,  in the overall context I think
for Miller they are--again, I
think, indicating the deeply sensed amerian hope/despair dilemna Miller
wants to get as far away from as possible--note his book on returning to
America in the Forties:  THE AIR-CONDITIONED NIGHTMARE.
        (Interestingly, it is in  Greece before returning to America, that
Miller finds true peace--see COLOSSUS OF MAROUSSI, his most beautiful
work.  However, it is not ancient Greece that Miller finds, but the
contemporary one, and the ancient in its present, taphonomic state.)

        The other scrap:

        when TSE died, Ezra Pound remarked, "now there's no one left to
understand my jokes".

        Grief--or nothingness?

                again, thank you for the thought provoking reply.

        I think before visual and sound poetry are basically put into, in
effect, the status of a dead language, a good deal more knowledge of it by
the critics of it is required.

        The Ubuweb is great for older works--but
        the new works there bear little indiction of what is going on
around the world--or even in the usa-- in visual poetry.

        There are a great many journals, conferences, web sites,
expositions, events, performances of visual/sound poetry, even in the USA,
which go pretty much largely ignored, for any number of reasons, by the
American poetic community.

        If anything, visual/sound poetry is an area which is always very
wide open and ever developing.

        Part of the problem is not that visual poetry and sound poetry are
dead lnaguages--it is that they are perhaps challenging, different
languages.

        Like learning any language--including that of "language
poetry"--discipline, dedication, study, thought and time and a lot of
hunting for the materials are required.

        The word barbarian comes from the Greek--to the Greeks, other
languages sounded like ba-ba-ba.

        To those who prefer to know only one language, any other language
will sound barbarian--or, if one truly wants to eradicate it, one
proclaims the other language  dead.  Recently a post was sent out by
the visual poet
Patrick Burgaud, noting the death of yet more Indian languages.

        Writers such as William S. Burroughs and Philadelpho Menezes have
indicated the  potentialities for "a simplified hieroglyphic
script" (WSB) and the poetry of the intersign (PM) in breaking down the
structures
put in place by the manifestations of language of the dominant ideological
complexes, the mass manipulations of thought control.

        I should note, that with a few very rare instances, it is
"language poetry" whch has been identified (more or less depending on one
's point of view) that is "acodominant" (Bob Grumman)
and not visual or sound poetry.

        To quote a few lines from Clarence Day:

        When cultures die, their legacies
        are often left to strange police.
        So it is that professors in New England guard
        the glory that was Greece.

         Perhaps it is a sign of the vitality of visual and sound poetry
that they are not yet taught in american univerisities!

        Keep the barbarians from the gates!

        And leave the Greeks to their strange  police--

        No--visual and sound poetry are ever in a state of development--

        as Bob Grumman so aptly puts it in the title of an essay:

        "MNMLST POETRY: UNACLAIMED BUT FLOURISHING"

        ( this may be found at:

        Light and Dust Mobile Anthology of Poetry--a great site for much
that is going on in visual, sound poetry and as well their critiques,
theoretical statements and historical documentations--

Ummm, have you read J lately?  He does define his terms and he gives good
examples of them too.  On metonymy for example he cites Tolstoy's focus on
Anna Karenina's handbag while she is committing suicide.  This example is
notorious. Notorious.

Here's another.  I once gave an exam question that went something like this:

There is a scene in one of the Godfather movies in which a handful of thugs
are eating at a restaurant.  Lots of glimpses of all the abundant food and
wine.  Suddenly Michael Corleone bursts in and the bloodbath ensues.  Food,
arms, wineglasses, legs, napkins, bodies, plates flying everywhere.

In a few seconds it is all over.  Corleone has disappeared.  Dead bodies
draped in blood all over the place.   The scene closes with a long, slow shot
of a cigarette, still lit, smoke rising slowly up into the air.

So, I asked my students, is this last shot of the cigarette an example of
metaphor or metonymy?  Explain.

I got some pretty good answers.

Hope this helps,

George Thompson

It's actually, I think, Coleridge's idea, except that he called it "Negative
Belief" or something like that.  Coleridge also invented the term
"psycho-analyze," but he did it in one of his notebooks which weren't
published until,  I think, the early twentieth century.  As for Hazlitt,
the interesting about him, to me, outside of a really excellent prose style
-- it reads as very contemporary, and sharp -- is that he was a nasty little
guy, who let loose on everybody, Coleridge especially (to the point of name
calling),  mostly venting on his older romantic peers whom he felt failed to
follow through on their early, radical politics.  He once had to take a
continental vacation to cure himself of drinking too much tea.  The
landlady's daughter you mention below was 16.

Dear Mr. Dillon:

        I got a kick out of your comment re TSE and George Herbert Walker
Bush.

        Wonder if TSE had wound up by some truly weird twist of fate
attending Yale--and being a member of the notorious secret society there
as was GHWB--

        what might have happened to him?

        It's interesting to note that TSE can include among his fellow St
Louis natives:  Miles Davis, Chuck Berry and William S. Burroughs.

        "Roll over Beethoven" indeed!

I think it also depends on how you conceptualize possibility and diversity
in a given "literary environment," to bring back a term from Russian
Formalism.  I agree that there should be a timeliness to any particular
aesthetic response, but I don't think that timeliness necessarily has to be
a matter of progress.  We know from evolutionary biology, for example, that
under some conditions evolution slows, sometimes even reverses.  I'd be
surprised if this weren't also true for literary aesthetics.  As Chris
Alexander said, "it seems the
point would be less "a new sound" than the right sound at the right time."

Hi Ron,

Would you say,  then, that Steve McCaffery's "Carnival," Ian Hamilton
Finlay's Little Sparta, Juliet Ann Martin's "oooxxxooo",  John Cage's
graphical pieces, Wershler-Henry's "Grain: a Prairie Poem" (and translations
of Appolinaire into Klingon) and,  say,  Charles Bernstein's "Veil" share
the same "form"?

The problem with what you write below is that you early define form as
something like a "haiku" or a "sonnet" -- singular names that point to
specific (either by syllable count, rhyme, meter) types of poems, and then
say the forms become antiquarian when the social forces that produced them
have fallen away.  But the sonnet as declaration of love went out in the
(roughly) 18th century -- Wordsworth,  Coleridge and Shelley wrote political
sonnets that appeared in the newspapers,  and also wrote sonnets (like
"Ozymindias," however it's spelled) that were pure imagism (of sorts).  Now,
it is used mostly,  I feel,  as a form of landscape painting (at least in
the conservative tradition) or a record of "dailiness" (in the New York
School vein) -- the social forces that lead to the sonnet long having
departed, but the sonnet itself having acquired some new sheen as a kind of
clunky old thing, like an old chevy,  that we are happy to keep around.

In any case, your sense of how a genre becomes "identified" (though a sonnet
is hardly a "genre", or at least I think of "poetry" as a "genre") turns
into "literary devices",  which suggest a plurality of techniques that you
are not naming.  Would we name them,  we would call B. Andrews' technique in
I Don't Have Any Paper the "all-over prose two-pager," or Bernstein's
technique in Shade the "skinny", Howe's technique the "melville" etc. etc.
-- defining a "form" in this sense is tricky.  It seems to me that the
innovative tradition in American poetry thrives on mixing these forms all
the time, and so one would be more prone to describe this activity, this
practice,  along formal terms than the final products, which are usually
rather heterodox.  I suppose the "New Sentence" might be a "new form," but I
have yet to see a significant critical discussion of all the people who
wrote using this form and whether or not it was honored, successful,  etc.,
which I think would be useful.

New sounds have been invented; Christian Bok, for example, pretty much uses
every organ in his body -- sound sounds are "liver sounds," some make you
fear for his health -- to make sounds, and creates a fine, overpower web of
tonalities in his readings.  I think you are right that there is an
"antiquarian" aspect to lots of concrete and sound poetry, and that most
people who do it lack  anything resemblinng an openness to contemporary
aesthetic or social values,  but that's because very few practitioners take
it very seriously as a discipline -- part of the reason Duchamp didn't
produce ready-mades every other day was because he wanted to stay in touch
with that specific sensation that leads to the discovery of a ready-made,
and Finlay's research into the English gardening tradition (and specific
avoidance of the Japanese tradition) are what make his work so exceptional
(not to mention the other researches).  The Torontonians and Brazilians are
unique today in really taking the idea of "concrete" poetry seriously,  but
nobody in the United States seems to take _them_ seriously,  so much of the
content fails to get across.

I don't think there's a common enough discourse on concrete and sound poetry
for anyone to jump in "become" a sound or concrete poet right away.  It
seems so easy; I actually think it's quite difficult.  Because sound and
concrete poetry are so expensive to reproduce, there is hardly a "canon" --
ironically, all of our pomo arguments against canon formation find a
counter-argument here, in that there is so much of this work out there,
little significant (i.e. establishment of values) critical discourse about
it, that all we see are xeroxed cut-ups from newspapers, weird line
drawings, Ernst-like two-minute collages, etc., always being reproduced as
"new."

Ron, again and again, I am struck with how many people on this list live in=20=
the past, be it 100 years ago or 10 years ago. It's obvious by now that "the=
 literary devices that have been associated with langpo" already caught on y=
ears ago. If we are to judge antiquity of a particular genre by the amount o=
f schlock encountered in small independent press, langpo would come out a cl=
ear champion, far exceeding vispo redundancies. the real problems with sound=
po and vispo lie not in their age, or lack of social context, but with its p=
ractitioners often ignorance of general visual/musical principles underlying=
 visual arts and music. Vispo is also suffering from poor production values=20=
in general, which is understandable considering its long-term marginal statu=
s. However, to state that "vispo would rather look adventurous rather than b=
e adventurous" is to invite examination of langpo itself on this subject. Se=
veral well-known langpo poets have been known to venture into vispo and soun=
dpo territory on occasion; and poet
s like Jackson MacLow, highly regarded in the langpo community, made a valua=
ble contribution to these genres. There are also some known vispoets whose t=
extual strategies bear strong marks of langpo influence, whether they want t=
o admit it or not. These crossovers provided some of the most interesting wo=
rk in recent years. On the other hand, a lack of new ideas and a general sen=
se of stalemate in the traditional langpo in the last 5-6 years has been ine=
scapable. The bottom line is: this whole village is glass, and throwing ston=
es is a bad idea.

Best,
Igor Satanovsky

One of the curious fates of poetic form is that once a genre has become
identified, it goes on forever even as the social context that led to it
dissolves into the fabric of time. If the literary devices that have been
associated with langpo catch on, it will suffer the same fate, so it's not
ultimately a question of who has a better form. Rather, it is how one
approaches the world and what currently exists. Most vizpo would rather look

[sonnet]

Swords of green slice the grid where white gulls
    sit
In the wake of Autumn rain,  the goalposts
Bookend my walk - the curved thousands - tender
Beaks devour bright,  new fall rain, slow drops.
Alone is the word of a leaky vessel.
It spreads among the scattered straws of road.
So light as to hover over hemlock,
And with a gardener's hand, the air I tend.

Undelivered, I return to silence,
Chanting without tongue unformed miles.

Épées de part verte la grille où les gulls blancs
se reposent à la suite de la pluie d'automne, les
goalposts Bookend ma promenade - les milliers
incurvés - devour tendre de becs lumineux,
ouvelle pluie de chute, baisses lentes. Seul est
le mot d'un navire perméable. Il écarte parmi les
pailles
dispersées de la route. Allumez ainsi quant au
vol plané au-dessus du hemlock, et avec la main

je reviens au silence, chantant sans langue
unformed
des milles.

Swords of green share the grid where the white
      gulls rest
Following the rain of autumn, the goalposts
Bookend my walk - curved thousands -devour
To tighten luminous nozzles, new rain of fall,
      slow falls.

Only is the word of a permeable ship.
It draws aside among the dispersed straws of the
        road.
Light thus as for the gliding flight above the
      hemlock,
And with the hand of a gardener, the air which I
        tighten.

Not delivered, I return to silence,
Singing without language unformed miles.

I can't really argue with the first line. Could

I find "to tighten luminuos nozzles" and

Greenboathouse Books=92
Broadsheet Series 2000

This project will bring together 15 new and established writers from across
Canada, one poem to be selected by each writer. These broadsheets will be
designed individually to compliment the form and content of the poem, takin=
g
all possible design aspects into account, including graphics, the dimension=
s
of the sheet, the type of paper, type of printing, as well as various types
of physical presentation (single flat sheet, accordion fold, printing insid=
e
a small box, etc). The end results will be sold both individually and as a
collection, price to be determined in accordance with production costs.

As this is not a contest, there will be no cash prize. Selected writers wil=
l
receive a copy of the full collection, with two additional copies of that
writer=92s broadsheet.

Submissions: 3-5 poems with an entry fee of two dollars per poem. Checks
should be made out to Jason Dewinetz (editor). Poems should be no more than
one page given the nature of the project format. The deadline is December
31, 2000.

Although the permanent mailing address for Greenboathouse Books is in Verno=
n
(2007 - 37th Avenue, Vernon, BC, V1T 2W9), submissions to this contest
should be posted to the following address:

That's interesting.  But _Liber Amoris_ (which I confess I haven't read)
surely means _Book of Love_?

>Kasey. Thanks. The "his" was an habitual slip. I try to put "their" nowdays. Neg cap was mentioned by either R Silliman or C Bernstein in an essay in "The American Tree" but I'm sure I've seen the Keats letter somewhere re it. I used to enjoy (and still do) Hazlitt's and Lamb's essays.But the way I write I, well I just let the words work thru me: I cant explain it. It sounds heroic and mystical but it happens. Writing is like making music - hence my hint re John Asbery's regret that he had never learnt how to compose music. The musical composition analogy (for Ashbery and writers of his kind) comes via the subconscious. Mozart used to "see" a whole symphony instantaneously. Then he just wrote it down. Not on all works. but the mind (brain-body to me) is a very powerful creative (and very mysterious)machine.Kasey, these other guys just complicate neg cap too much.They're probably frightened of the unknown etc.Richard.

Dear Ward:

        I think you make some very good points here--I would say esp with
yr last sentence--that is very very important with what aspects of the
visual work that Burroughs/Gysin did and also the works and writings of
Philadelpho Menezes are concerned with.
        Part of the problem is that language we know has become
"automatic"--

        there is an essay i would very highly recommend at Light and Dust
by Karl Young called "Notation and the Art of Reading" in this regard:

        http://www.thing.net/~grist.homekarl.htm

        also works by Menezes are here and at the excellent Menezes
tribute being put together at the epc

        I am not sure though that the visual is not cognition--and by this
I do not mean "recognition" which in a sense is both automatic and not:

        for example: the Uncanny--see Freud's very good essay on that

        and also in Emerson's phrase:  "it is strange to me yet not
unknown"

        i mean something other, which is that in the act, the activity of
seeing, via attention., is a form of thinking--

        i do not know if others experience this. but often in just walking
around i am not thinking in words or "automatic" "recognition" but with
what is presented visually as thought--for example sidewalk cracks, bark,
fragmented or chipped rocks, bricks, concrete--corrosions of metal,
calligraphies of trees--movement of light--this all is thinking--

        i know i am not alone in experiencing this as spent many happy
hours with bob cobbing doing this--sounding and acting the thinking of these
things as we received this thinking--no need for words--or "ideas'--but
very much a thinking--
        i wd say we learned immensities

        i know from personal experience jwcurry also knows this visual
thinking

        i do not know if this is what others may say is thinking--but i
know for some it is--

        often in defining something, we make it so that we only "see it
that way"--

        i.e. visual/cognitive as separate

        the Uncertainty Principle of Heisenberg helps one in understanding
questions opened by this area--that is, in the continual questioning
of what is the relation of the visual and the cognitive

        Picasso said:  "I do not seek, I find"

        i regard this as an aspect of the visual as thinking

        i realize i may be on shaky ground here to say the very least re
the received ideas of these questions, yet i am not one to argue with
Pablo, Bob Cobbing or jwcurry!

        Touche, Mark!

        actually--the description here sounds to me like first grade
lessons
in reading--

        all these things were very important to just getting through a few
word sentence.

         remember thinking--before i learned to read--i cdn't wait!--as
had already been exploring letters and trying to see them ,in what ways
the shapes made sounds for example-- you just knew when you cd read those
signs, they wd speak--and all kinds of marvelous adventures where in
those pages--i used to hold a book up and listen to it--to see if i cd
hear it, the sounds--
        but then when
i started to learn what was called reading (of writing)
 i thought what a
botch someone had made of the whole thing!


        i had really imagined it being more hieroglphyic rather than the
seemingly limited forms  (what?--only 26--supposedly most humans had more
teeth in their skulls than that!) so flatly used--

        i think Mark is right--

        too much is being attempted to be squeezed into too small a space
in
this statement--

        think it's better to allow room for extension, as Mark notes--

        from Larry Eigner:

        "A poem extends itself like you're walking down the street.  And
you extend the walk sometimes, unexpectedly"  (Larry Eigner Remembered 33)

George wrote: "for example he [Jakobson] cites Tolstoy's focus on Anna
Karenina's handbag while she is committing suicide. This example is
notorious. Notorious."

Sorry, but I don't see how this is a metonymy!  Nor the Godfather examples.
A metonymy is the substitution of one term for another in which the two
terms bore some relation to each other.

"I bought a Picasso"  (I bought a painting made by Picasso)

"Congress attacked Madison Avenue"  (Madison Avenue represents,
metonymically, the advertising industry)

Now if I used the word "handbag" in a sentence in which the word stood in
for Anna K, that would be a metonymy.

"Here comes old 'big purse'."

"The suits are nervous about the impending restructuring."

Suits here means people who wear suits, in other words, the management of
the company.

"He is a skirt chaser."  Skirt, metonymically, means women.

This is what I originally meant when I said that Jakobson defined metonymy
in a way that led to noone knowing what it was any more!  The idea of
contiguity is especially misleading, since metonymy usually goes along the
lines of cause for effect, effect for cause, part for whole, characteristic
for object, container for the thing contained, etc...  Not simply two
objects that are simply next to each other or adjoining.  My bathroom is
contiguous to my bedroom, but this has nothing to do with the trope of
metonymy.

I too would like to hear from the person who said Jakobson was mistaken in
his definition of metalanguage, and to hear George's refutation of this
other person!

Brian,

Yeah, Coleridge was good with coinages.  That always gets you credit in
the history books. But Hazlitt's treatise was out by 1805.  Still more,
STC was living as an opium befogged dependent when Johnny Keats came of
age, while Hazlitt was a working journalist.  Furthermore, Hazlitt's
treatise had been published by 1805.  Finally, this idea is not so far from
the general tenor of post-Lockean English philosophy--imaginative
identification with the other is a cornerstone of David Hume & Adam
Smith's ideas about sympathy.  Hazlitt's innovation is to link this with
thought of the future and effectively subvert the idea of self-interest by
using the tools of self-interest.

Oh, and don't get me started about Coleridge's frailties:  between Hazlitt
and STC, it is simply not a fair fight.  As for Hazlitt being "nasty":
on the earlier generation's politics, he was absolutely right.  They did
"sell out," quite literally in Wordsworth's case (though evidence seems to
be against him being an actual spy).  However, despite all the gossip
spread by Coleridge and others against him, Hazlitt also could also write
of them quite generously, as in _The Spirit of the Age_ which came out in
1825.  That and he remembered folk like Godwin, Horne Tooke, etc, who were
being buried by the rush to conformity of the dissenting middle classes.
He was complex, but it was because (and he is much smarter than Coleridge
in this respect), he didn't let his hopes blinker a sharp sense for the
realities of human life.

As for the latin:  there I go again, mistaking a book for freedom.

Cheers,
Robert

Kore Press is pleased to announce the publication of Alison Deming and
Lucinda Bliss' book Anatomy of Desire, The Daughter/Mother Sessions.  A
book signing will occur, Sunday, October 16, 2000 at 6:00 PM at the Hazmat
Gallery, 197 E. Toole Ave.

Anatomy of Desire, The Daughter/Mother Sessions, funded in part by the
Arizona Humaitites Council, is the intimate dialogue between mother and
daughter on female desires, passions, and experiences. Faith Wilding in her
introductory essay to The Anatomy of Desire says:
The remarkable dialogue in this book is an opening into fearsome and
sublime territories, where home comforts and home truths are scarce; where
ancient hierarchies and silences have been broken. I hope that the
passionate, disturbing, and sometimes triumphant voices of these two
artists will inspire many others with the courage to enter where they have
led.

Alison Deming is the author of Science and Other Poems, selected for the
Walt Whitman Award of the Academy of American Poets, The Monarchs: A Poem
Sequence and a collection of essays, Temporary Homelands. She has edited
Poetry of the American West: A Columbia Anthology. Among other awards, she
has received a Wallace Stegner Fellowship at Stanford University, two NEA
Fellowships, a Pushcart Prize and a fellowship from the Fine Arts Work
Center in Provincetown. She is an Associate Professor of Creative Writing
at the University of Arizona.

Lucinda Bliss has exhibited widely is the Southwest, Illinois, and New
England. Venues include The College of the Atlantic in Maine, Gallery 312
and the cooperative gallery South of North in Chicago, Firestone ArtSpace,
Copeland-Rutherford Gallery, Zitlala, and the Red Goebel in New Mexico. She
received an MFA in Visual Art from Vermont College and a BA in Art History
from Skidmore College.

Kore Press, Inc.is a non-profit corporation founded on the belief that the
architecture of the book is an extension of the text it houses. Kore
combines a passion for the book as art with a commitment to publishing
literature. The works published by Kore are innovative in their
presentation or content and often represent visual/verbal collaborations or
experiments in form and technique. Anatomy of Desire The Daughter Mother
Sessions was designed by Kore Board members Lisa Bowden and Nancy Solomon.

Yes--and I believe the act of adding "new" letters or inventing new
alphabets/hieroglyphs has been performed in some fascinating
ways by visual poets.

I just found out that my name, Aaron Sanderson Belz, anagrams to "A LARDASS
BORNE ON ZEN" -- has everyone seen
http://www.wordsmith.org/anagram/index.html ??  Kind of takes the art out of
anagramming, I guess.

Hi David.  Seems I must repeat and repeat.  What has been ignored in both
your and Mark's responses is my focus on speech vs. writing as a hierarchy
with speech on the top rung.  Derrida violates that privileging of speech and
I perceive the langpoets as the closest thing we have in poetry to a similar
dissembling.  They talked about it in print, after all, so this is not
reaching on my part.  My comment which you both refer to immediately follows
that point.  In context, it is quite nonsensical to read my comment as
placing Olson or Williams within a Derridian "circle."  Both poets are firmly
rooted in the hierarchy (and great poets both).  Derrida collapses speech
into writing.  Its potential to mean does not issue from intention, or voice,
or a new American language that somehow transcends, or the breath (which
clearly privileges voice as in Olson).  For Derrida, the system must be in
place for any one of its elements to mean.  Writing is not a secondary
version of speech.  Rather, at best, speech may be understood as a subtext
within writing.  Langpo is somewhere on this path--Olson and Williams are
not.  Gotta read the entire post, guys, and put it all together before you
jump.  Gotta read lots of Derrida too since it's quite impossible for me or
anyone to repeat his arguments in total on the list.  I must by necessity
assume more than passing familiarity.  Agree or disagree about my view of
langpo, love Derrida or hate him, but anyone can be misprisoned out of
context.  You don't really want to do that, do you?  That's really first
grade stuff.   Best wishes to you both, Bill

To be fair to Mark and David, allow me to add the following (though I'm in
danger now of boring myself, as well as everyone else--apologies to all).
When I wrote that langpo "contains" speech forms, the word loses some of its
potency in English.  In Derrida's French the word does not merely suggest
inclusion.  It also means to control and--and this is crucial--diminish.
This is part of what I meant by our needing to know Derrida's texts really
well.  No one can accuse Olson or Williams of diminishing speech forms and
privileges within their fascination for writing.  And by "fascination for
writing" I meant far more than their interest in pens and typewriters.
Again, I was assuming a knowledge of how Derrida treats such words.  Writing
is, of course, marks on the page.  But for Derrida it is so much more.  It is
the entire relational language system which permits all utterances to mean.
Once this is understood, my comment about containing speech within writing
makes a bit more sense, and is limited in such a way as to exclude speech
privileging poets like the spoken word guys and, come to think of it, most
Romantics.  So langpoets' stress on how writing appears on the page (spacing,
relation, etc.) might be more important philosophically to them than it was
for Olson, Williams, et al.--not that it wasn't important to them also, but
their breath lines and variable feet, etc., do not insist on such exact
positioning, in my view.  On the other hand James Breslin tried to make the
case that Williams was indeed Derridian.  Mark, you might want to check out
his book.  It's a compelling argument.  My own little book, I hope,
established T.S. Eliot as one of Derrida's most important philosophical
precursors among 20th century poets.  The stress here is on the word
"philosophical."  Otherwise many might assume that Stein overarches all in
this regard.  She is definitely among Derrida's influences.  Does any of this
help?  If not, I'll slip my tail between my legs and move on.  Best, Bill

 </bold>         Emily Harvey Gallery will present<bold><italic>
Footnotes</italic></bold>, an exhibition of new work by Fluxus
artist<bold> Alison Knowles.

</bold>         This body of work reveals a range of innovations
through combinations of objects, texts and unusual art materials.
Conceived as an environment, the different components of the exhibit
are based upon experiments regarding the nature of the page and the
meaning of what a book can be.

          The pieces reflect Knowles' instinct to note everyday events
and continually re-examine those experiences, regardless of chronology
and linear thinking. Her work is faithful to life experience and the
nature of the materials. Large panels extending from the ceiling and
walls are page like in their structure, containing various embedded
elements and incorporating projections on a grand scale. Some pieces
may be explored by gallery visitors through touch. Silkscreen and
Palladium prints, as well as cyanotype reflect Knowles' mastery of
printmaking.

         The impetus for "Footnotes"  is a lifelong continua of global
travel, from which the artist has literally "picked up" things and
created annotated journals. The concept of footnotes therefore is a
means of referencing  and reorganizing those travels, transferring the
literary device into visual forms.

         Well-known for her experimental performances and
installations from the early 60s in association with Fluxus movement,
and by her affiliation with<bold> Something Else Press</bold>,  Knowles
has continually investigated the form and content of books. Examples of
her previous works include the monumentally scaled<bold><italic> Big
Book</italic></bold>  from  l967 and a "walk-in" object <bold><italic>
The Book of Bean</italic></bold>  from l983 which was exhibited in the
Venice Biennale in l990.



      In coordination with the exhibition, Granary Books is publishing
Knowles's book<italic> Footnotes: Collage Journal, 30 Years</italic>,
incorporating many of the elements of the exhibition but in a different
form. There are actual footnotes by the artist here. Copies are
available for sale at the gallery.

Dear George Thompson,

I was not the person, but what I remember was somebody, in response to a
question I
had about metonymy and metaphor, wrote that Jakobson mistakenly identified
them as opposites.

Could you be prepared to defend Jakobson against that claim.
Do you think Jakbobson sees them as opposites?
Do you agree with that assessment?
And with the value J places on them?
And, if so, why?

Thank you....

A Poetics Colloquium: Body/Sex/Writing
Christopher W. Alexander

I feel pressured to write a thorough-going preface to this afternoon's
event, something that could share in the intensity or intensities that =
move
through the exchange-s that follow. Unfortunately, the
material-cum-corporeal situation of my own writing mitigates against good
intention, as my tendonitis - in the left, though I am tempted to say
'limp' wrist - has been nearly disabling for weeks now. Apparently, the
body has its own priorities - though whether they are indeed its own is
questionable; as Bataille reminds us, the human order is borne chiefly of
its architecture, rather than vice versa. Or, as he might have said from
Detroit instead of Paris, "now I wanna be your dog" - which saying
presupposes that I am, and yet provides in that performative enunciation
for some unforeseen deviation, a movement against architecture.

The idea of an email colloquium is one that Joel Kuszai and I have
discussed numerous times, and specifically as one possibility for
displacing the listserv-medium from its usual habit of speed and brevity,
if not concision: not to dislodge the list from its conversational mode,
but to make a further allowance, and too an allowance for further
conversation. Though Joel was not 'here' to help me construct this event, =
I
think he would approve of its impetus no less than its outcome: the
lodestar Dodie Bellamy's reconsideration of the project of transgressive
writing, and the various courses through and around the transgressive
navigated by that star. For my part, I am happy to have provided a forum
for these writers to discourse on this important topic, and excited at the
prospect of further response.

About the structure of the colloquium: participants were divided into four
groups, and each participant was given the opportunity to address =
Dodie=B9s
piece and the prior responses that had been generated within the group; in
other words, members of each of the four groups generated their chain of
responses independently of the totality of responses. Part of my interest
in this structure, which was developed chiefly for simplicity, has been to
see the several directions each discussion took. It will be of further
interest, I hope, to see how the whole might be addressed, both by the
initial participants - few of whom have seen even the whole of their
group=B9s responses - and by any subscribers who choose to continue the
discourse.

Who was asked: invitations were made to subscribers and non-subscribers
alike based on previous writings on this topic, either in posts to the
Poetics List or in other publications; many were invited, and I am =
grateful
to these who came forward to participate.

What is hoped-for: that this exchange will challenge the formal =
constraints
of the listserv, chiefly its tendency toward shorter and more ephemeral
statements vis-a-vis traditionally-published documents; and, on the
contrary, that this exchange can exploit the tendency of the listserv to
informal dialogue and rapid response, extending this colloquium past the
Colloquium and into broader conversation.

Poetics List Colloquium: Group Zero, Number One

Sex/Body/Writing
by Dodie Bellamy


"a fairy tale assumption in which an all but non-existent condition is
assumed to be rampant" - Samuel R. Delany


The accused is permitted to display the bumper sticker EAT SHIT because it
is determined that no motorist, not even a coprophiliac, is likely to be
sexually aroused by a bumper sticker reading EAT SHIT.

arousal = criminal

non-arousal = noncriminal

Offensiveness is outside the equation. When I write, "My cunt is a camera,"
is this likely to arouse photographers, the scenic vistas of my camera's
wandering eye - or the filmstock itself?

I'm working towards a writing that subverts sexual bragging, a writing that
champions the vulnerable, the fractured, the disenfranchised, the sexually
fucked-up. A female body who has sex writing about sex - no way can I stand
in front of an audience reading this stuff and maintain the abstraction the
"author" A BODY some writers glory in this but I feel miserable and invaded
- as if the audience has x-ray vision and can see down to the frayed
elastic on my panties. But, really, it is I who have invaded my own
privacy. To regain some of that privacy I have desexualized myself in
public, have stiffened, as if to say, "This is not a body."

To a five o'clock cocktail party in Berkeley I wear a black Italian
pantsuit with a pink silk blouse - because that's the way the women dressed
at the last five o'clock cocktail party I went to, at the French Consulate.
But in Berkeley everybody's in linen, jeans, sandals. J.C. is casual chic,
lanky as a cornstalk, all in white - white linen shorts, white shirt, flame
white hair, single silver hoop in his ear. Standing beside him, I feel like
a black bat. "I'm having some problems with transgressive writing," he
says. "Why is A.M. Homes so popular? Because she's transgressive without
being challenging." Transgressive but not challenging YES these words
circle through my head like a mantra for days - a formula for just about
everything that pisses me off. Any sentence containing the word "gender" is
at the top of my list.

EAT SHIT NO/BODY

F., I have heard, rejected a piece of mine because it contained too many
body fluids. Now, two years later, I run into him at the Small Press
Traffic mailbox. He shows me a favorite passage from Blanchot: the poet
must expose himself to the violence of pure being. Or some such thing.
"Yes," I say, "but how do you then go to work?" F. explains how he thinks
one could juggle that. He's sweet today, so shy, so halting, so "I'll lick
your boots." A guy confusing as Lon Chaney - the clownface dissolves to
disgruntled scientist dissolves to clown - He who gets slapped (MGM, 1924)
gets the last laugh. I don't know what to think of him. I smile, say, "Good
luck on your thesis," and walk down the stairs.

A physical body writes about sex.

H. sits at the back of my prose workshop, sullen alienation brooding in the
corner. I take one look at him and think, "Oh shit." His attractiveness is
not wrought from art school pretension - it's more of an afterthought - if
that. H's writing deals with schizophrenia/paranoia/madness/psychological
disintegration. "i live with monsters who are contagious," he writes. "the
transmitter planted deep inside my ear instructs the following: i, to
justify misfortune and misery of fallen angels, is chosen to sacrifice you
to unknown forces that make cars move." I ask him personal questions he
refuses to answer, but I keep asking anyway. I learn he's Korean and his
family's in Los Angeles. That's all.

In one piece a woman gets too close to him so he eats her. It's his
"Archiving" assignment. "Choose an object that you can easily bring to
class. Write a real or imagined narrative explaining this object's
significance - its importance in 'your' life, how it came to be a part of
'your' life. Type and make copies for the class. Bring your object with
you." He brings in a plastic fork and knife.

"The smell of her boiling flesh invaded my room. shes here no longer but
she's here with me. the plastic fork inscribes embryo, the plastic knife
paints pictures of her memory. what can i say, i've fallen in love with
her."

I don't let on *how* drawn I am to this writing, but H. seems to know
anyway. Over the semester his manner softens to sweetness, eagerness,
affection even. The one day he's not in class I miss him. Unanswered
questions, I suppose, are a form of intimacy. He writes, "you, standing
middle of my target, i can admire you more than physics allows me." I know
this isn't about me, but I pretend.

I do a little makeover: lose some weight, streak my hair, spend teaching
money on new clothes. T., whom I haven't seen in months, walks up to me at
a party and says, "You look really good." In the past he hasn't given me
the time of day - even though I've made overtures. I think, "I hate you,"
get out of the conversation as quick as I can.

The last day of class. S. has changed her hair from white blonde to yellow
blonde. "I was looking too 80s." S. projects a desperation for attention
that she doesn't have a clue how to get. (My softspot for her.) Finally,
after hinting about it all semester, she's writing directly about being
raped. "in the back of my head lingo had long since departed and I wasn't
prepared to go down" This form is really working for you, I tell her, the
straightforward narrative interspersed with poetic intensities. I think to
myself, "This woman, this BODY has been raped for Christ's sake." While
Creative Writing teaches us thus to hermetically seal content in
aesthetics, I'm thinking, "Dodie, you are so full of shit."

The time is up and I say, "Well, we're finished - in a big way."

H. blurts out, "Want to go out for a drink or something? I need some
closure."

Writing that shifts the matrix, e.g. Samuel Delany's *Hogg.* "What it
seriously attempts to do," Delany explains in a 1989 letter to Randy Byers,
"is challenge just about every dichotomy on which our culture is based. And
the distinction between dirty and clean - as a grounding for both
civilization and pleasure - is one of society's most fundamental." And
then, "*Hogg* constantly compels the reader to choose one filth-laden
situation *over* another, when most of us would simply want to be rid of
the entire set of experiences."

Fountain pen scribbling across paper, a body writes about sex. Sitting at
the computer, a body writes about sex. The keyboard and monitor are
enormously erotic THE BEEPING MODEM, THE WORD MACHINE TALKING BACK more
than once e-mail has gotten me in trouble.

I wake up to a shock of wet at my feet - Stanley, my cat, has peed in the
bed while I was sleeping in it. "I'll deal with this later." I get up, make
coffee, sit down at the computer and take some Delany notes - "hebephilia,
the love of filth" - I'm reading and typing and thinking about Delany for
an hour or so when the scent of cat urine impinges upon me - the gray
jersey nightgown I'm wearing reeks with Stanley's urine. How marvelous, I
think, Delany has imbedded my woof and warp NO DISTANCE WOOF AND WARP I
toss the nightgown in the hamper, throw on another thriftstore favorite,
this one with "Neiman Marcus" in huge red script down the length of it, and
continue typing.

Poetics List Colloquium: Group One, Number Two

Part-Writing, a Response in Part to Dodie Bellamy's "Sex/Body/Writing"
by Taylor Brady

If one version of the social and political poetics of an earlier
modernism hinged on the belief that "the pure products of America go
crazy," then perhaps we could begin to register the minor
epistemological break of our own belated modernity by coming to terms
with our escalating suspicion of some pure process driving them there
- that there is, after all, a kind of "witnessing," adjusting,"
"driving the car," despite poetry's often desperate rush to absent
itself from the architectures in which it negotiates terms for its
own culpability with this science of administration.

So I'm sitting on the train and I have these two bodies, and the one
is always eating the other, the other always eating away at the one,
rabid to bite away another like itself, part of itself, partially
like itself except for the minimal difference in charge that seems to
promise discharge at a different level of scale altogether - as the
filthy ass of another passenger's jeans (a Baudelaire kind of moment,
this flash of address in the crowd, but without the recognition that
the vision of a person would provide, this "flash" so brief that sex,
age, even whether the hands that presumably hang to either side and
frame this vision are scabrous and scandalous or neatly manicured -
all pass unremarked) sets in motion a series of effects at once
microscopic and vast, the minor hitch of breath touching off a squall
of feedback in the monitors, the minor oily smudge on the lens
destroying or diffracting the entire archive which defers the
promises of history to performance - there are stars, fans,
technicians from one end of this to the other - not the least of
these effects being the call to attention of my own presumably
(always) filthy ass as it tails me through the classical and tragic
unities of adulthood and citizenship, surveillance of the remainder
in which neither body is entirely freedom or discipline, but the
uneven imperative, "Except where otherwise noted, please eat
yourself," reingest that part which nonetheless continues to gnaw its
way out of you, chew away the wholeness of that which nonetheless
continues to swallow you whole, and repeat, repeat (I might need, at
some point, to account for this basically formalist compulsion),
until every part is an eaten whole, every whole an eating part, the
singularity of the filthy and anonymous ass shadowed by the
presumption of hands that work up generalizable axioms through a kind
of signature into the linear architectures of transit, indifferent to
both the scummed-over and the scrubbed-clean, in which one finally
gets the benefit of a horizon only at the cost of being displaced -
or rather, stretched - along it, rather than sited against it, and I
realize in my quickened breathing and oily palms along this horizon
of inert, blocked-out morning bodies, not at any moment, but across
the total process, that I might be writing a roundabout gloss to my
thoroughly partial reading of Dodie Bellamy's uneven and compelling
imperative: "EAT SHIT NO/BODY."

What I have found so useful in Samuel Delany's pornotopic writings
(Bellamy mentions HOGG, and I'd also point to the more recent The Mad
Man) is their presentation of various paraphilias -- fairy-tale
assumptions or not -- as instances of a real social and ethical
practice, rather than the simply "licentious" and utopian/dystopian
destruction of the social most "transgressive" writing goes to such
ideological lengths to position them as; so that for Delany, the
perversions of a character like Mad Man Mike or Leaky do not simply
pose the largely metaphorical threat of washing away society and
history in a wave of fluid filth, but the far more real threat of
engaging a theoretical practice of sex which knows itself to be a
production and exchange of fluids and parts among other fluids and
parts, rather than an axiomatic of need in which the existing
sculptural unities of gendered, raced, classed bodies simply put the
appropriate shoulder -- queer or otherwise -- to the appropriate
wheel in a machine the operation of which is only a matter of being
at one's post on time, and not, as The Mad Man suggests so
effectively, a manufacture and circulation of particles of gender,
race, class along with the droplets and particles of shit, urine,
semen, mucus, dirty fingernails, and blood.

I commute to my job as a writer.

I find myself very hesitant to write in defense of gender by way of
answer to Bellamy's anger at the word, but find also that
celebrations of "pure sex" by straight male writers are too often a
mere sleight-of-hand effacement and apologetics for existing
institutional practices of the very gender they disavow -- and this
again is a value I find in Delany's work, in that the paraphilias of
his novels are not a detached "other side," but might return to
interrogate our statistically more-common hetero- and
homosexualities, to reveal their gendered positions as
sedimentations, ideological formations limiting and channeling the
sexual practices that found them (bearing in mind the full complexity
of a reading of ideology that acknowledges it as an unavoidable
modality by which we first come to suspect the possibility of the
very reality it obscures).

The writing and art practice of myself and many of my male near
contemporaries seems focused almost to obsession on the mechanics of
pre-adolescent desire, to various effect, as in the profusion of
toys, fetishized commodities and shiny things that make loud noise in
this year's "Bay Area Now" group show at the Yerba Buena Art Center
in San Francisco, the best of this work, like David Huffman's
"Traumabots," with their dissonant meeting of minstrelsy, Japanophile
pop fetishism, sexed bodies both too transparent and too opaque to
equal themselves, and landscapes of dangling viscera keeping the
hidden body in circulation, getting at the difficulty of a moment
when the boy's pleasure in playing with other bodies, others' bodies,
has been first hailed by the demand to enter into an abject relation
with race, a foundational relation with gender, a consumptive and
reproductive relation with history and culture, but before the
response to this call has been fully articulated -- a moment when an
alternate route is still at least thinkable. (see note 1)

"I have these two bodies" -- and already the language is working
against me, turning a productive dislocation into possession, the
incommensurate into an apartment and a vacation cabin, a home and an
office, aggregating architecture into development, and accumulating
the flecks of dirt on denim and under fingernails into a bona fide
real estate, where the false carnival of pleasure receives its
operating permit from an equally false science of administration, or,
as in Rod Smith's "Write Like Soap":

                                        (licks inside

                won't subside. Mazes,

                furiously significant, type

                a person out of

                adjusted circus belief.


What might it mean to adopt Bellamy's call for "a writing that
subverts sexual bragging, a writing that champions the vulnerable,
the fractured, the disenfranchised, the sexually fucked-up," as a
program for the male body writing the male body?

I "invade my own privacy" by writing about what I see on a train, in
transit between one publicly-sanctioned privacy and another, why I
see it, what it sees in me or on me, why I can't "glory in this," but
find pleasure there nonetheless.

An asymmetry in the public dimension of literary work, in which sex
might do the work of writing, but gender orchestrates the response
from the other side of the lectern, the blank approbation of applause
or the blank refusal of incomprehension making you good or bad but
definitely whole again, so that you have to disavow the fucked-up,
fragmented body that avowed itself in the work, and go home pissed
off at gender all over again (?)

Like Walter Benjamin's historian-collector, "to seize hold of a
memory" or image of the fragmentary, circulating body of parts at the
"moment of danger" of its own inevitable collapse into the sculptural
body of a frozen (and always getting colder) present, so that I might
lift this shine of rubbed-in grease off a back pocket before it
adheres to a body about which I always know in advance how I feel,
where I stand, what mechanics I desire in the spaces between it and
my own body, so that I might write of a sexual gesture that might
jump out of the choreography of gender ("Theses on the Philosophy of
History," Illuminations, 255).

To lift a habitual syntax from Leslie Scalapino's recent work,
perhaps it might help to write, not of having a body, being in a
body, or even being a body, but to be on the body as the act of
writing.

One writes, I write (fiction, and we poets had better get used to
admitting the primacy of this) as a kind of body work, in order to
make sense of it on one's own body, not in order to make sense of the
body.

Scenes of instruction, the workshop, etc., might be adduced as
further evidence that one does not have a decided-upon body from
which one acts, enacts, sex, but that one practices a body, that this
practice might be learned, that the question might be raised, "What's
the sex of teaching?", a question which I can now ask, being no
longer a teacher.

Write what I will against "my" sex, my heterosexuality, as a
channelization and diminishment of the possibility of sex as such,
and however far this work of writing may carry me from it, the return
commute brings me back more or less reliably -- there are occasional
track fires, missed connections, even accidents, derailments and
suicides from the platform, but belief requires me to think of these
as always belonging to another person's experience, even and
especially when they happen to me.

The constant temptation confronting the "progressive, male,
heterosexual" writer -- a strange creature which flees the light of
which it continues to believe itself to be the source, and keeping in
mind Giorgio Agamben's suggestion that the devil might be, not the
supreme tempter, but the supremely temptable (The Coming Community,
31) -- is to idealize his opposition to his own sexual "state," in a
form that goes both too far and not nearly far enough: too far, in
that it positions other sexualities/sexes/sex as utopian zones of
pure license and the transparent production of pleasure, which they
can never in actuality be, wired as they are into many of the same
political, ideological and economic circuits through which
heterosexuality is programmed; not far enough, in that this making of
other sex a utopia underwrites a category-distinction between the
unattainable, the limit, finally the metaphysical paradise of sex
"over there," and the pragmatic, materialist physics of "one's own"
sex, this distinction, deciding its all-or-nothing always in favor of
nothing, in effect pre-empting the possibility of putting anything
substantive of my sex at stake. Unless otherwise noted I quote
myself, as in the following: "This debt began in childhood, as you
picked your nose until it bled and I stood in line, angling for a
taste - if the body was the principal in the scene, my interest lay
nonetheless in the variable rate at which its slippery edges accrued
to balance gendered image with dark matter, the weight unaccounted in
these separate entries for pleasure and disgust," or, what I looked
for were the minimal architectures, densities of circulation along
that imperfectly linear horizon of commuter transit.    What's at
stake in my writing body and my domestic body both will be found in
the contradictory compartments of that train(ed)-space, in learning
to practice it as site, horizon, and exchange of spewing, leaking,
swallowing, chewing parts, rather than a simple public utility
contract for power transfer from one body-as-known-quantity to
another.

"His mother, like millions of other mothers in Germany, used to say,
'Mr. Bungle sends his regards' whenever one of the countless little
catastrophes of childhood had taken place...; it was he who had
tripped you up when you fell and knocked the thing out of your hand
when it went to pieces" (Hannah Arendt, Introduction to Walter
Benjamin, Illuminations, 6).

..Or , in a bit of a contextual leap, Scalapino's "the 'small
person' - every one - adventures, as such. only" (New Time, 57).
        Or the parts, the mechanics of fluid and heat exchange, the
whole sexual garage, that comes into focus "...whenever one of your
beautiful synthetic objects slips through the pore between any two or
several parts of the several parts of me, separating organs from the
limit of their own insides, tugging insistently at my lips."

Body-allegory as opposed to body-symbolism, the body occupying the
same plane as that for which it stands, not "glorying in" itself as
transcendent, the vantage from which all that risk pays off, but
buffeted, fragmented by the very forces of it stands in for -- not
simply a schizoid multiple, but a determinate (if not "whole") set of
practices in which parts of one's body are always entering into a
writing that is a "WORD MACHINE TALKING BACK."

In alternate version A, the anonymous jeans on the train belong, by
statistical experience, to a woman, and the vision can't elide its
complicity in the institutions that make a man's taking pleasure in a
look on public transit such a loaded, even potentially anti-gestural,
gesture, even while the encounter is not reducible to this, as it
hinges on an instability, a falling-apart into dirt and particle
matter, of the body which has the experience of pleasure only by
acknowledging its placement within that system in which one kind of
dirt calls out to another and there is no categorical cleanliness;
while in alternate version B, all the kids hanging out at the video
arcade in the mid-80s shopping mall in the working-class suburb in
Florida, boys and girls, wear the same skin-tight jeans gone fairly
luminous with the rubbed-in grease of summer and sebaceous early
adolescence, and this is by no means a vision of pre-lapsarian
license, as we all play at economy and power, circulating our tokens
among the Tank War machines, undecided yet whether to become product
or process, partly crazy and thoroughly impure.

Writing Sex Body
by Robert Gluck

I was moved by Taylor's description of a body that is "buffeted, fragmented
by the very forces it stands in for...."

Sexuality: I'm not only homosexual - but I'm always homosexual. In some
circumstances I am Homosexuality. When I sit on a chair it's a homosexual
chair; when I rise it renounces homosexuality; my homosexual breath puts a
spin on the atoms Socrates breathed. Words are homosexual when I use them,
or do I *attract* them? I put my sexuality on the world as *Espanol* puts
gender on words. Gl*ck lives in a Gl*ck world, to paraphrase Wittgenstein.
Compelling sexuality, alarmingly threadbare. It furiously builds a world on
top that frays off in mismatched threads at the bottom.

Gender: What a strange page the body is, covered by narration so many times
at once. The awareness of this arbitrary and total saturation is founded on
my experience as a gay child which made me a kind of prepuberty-Tiresias,
though in my case it wasn't the knowledge of pleasure I gained but the
unwanted, sickening knowledge of gender as artifact, and all I could
prophesize was my shame.  I remember that time very well, buffeted and
fragmented by the barren effects of gender. I tried to stiffen. Gender
seemed fantastically arbitrary since I seemed to be encased in the wrong
one. Maybe human shape seems immutable in one's twenties, but ask a queer
boy who is six, or any fifty-year-old. That the body is matter only makes
the body more fantastic - at this point, who would take matter seriously?

About twenty years later I was working on a story called "Nightflight." It
was about an infatuation that lacked a narrative - "a feeling with no
outlet, followed by a question mark." Pursuing the logic of the story - to
unite feeling with image - I borrowed a plot that seemed to be the same
size as my emotion. I chose one of Sade's *Crimes of Love* - wonderful
valentines that are nothing but plot. In it, the unfortunate heroine is
seduced by her brother, bears a child, then murders her grown-up son while
defending her honor against him, then marries her father, then testifies
against her mother which sends the poor woman to the scaffold. She doesn't
realize till the last page that they are her relatives, or related to each
other. I turned her into a man named Felix, the object of my obsession, and
I was writing along till I got to my hero's pregnancy and motherhood. For a
few days I was stumped, till in a weird elated transsexual moment I
realized that I would simply make Felix pregnant and then make him a
mother. A mother with a masculine pronoun. Even now I wonder what gap was
crossed. Perhaps my own assumptions had not curtailed me so much as the
assumptions that I imagined belonged to my audience.

That is, I'd already had dreams in which I become pregnant - not a problem.
So why did the ability of men to bear children temporarily vanish? And my
feeling of pleasure when I passed through that resistance resembled the
gratified freedom in dreams, when it's understood that I'm pregnant and I
am roundly congratulated. Why was gender so porous in my imagination, yet
so opaque in the realm of writing? - a realm entirely public and entirely
private. I wish for freedom in writing and in the dimension of flesh and
blood. I'm tired of the two old sexes. In *Margery* I wrote, "Gender is the
extent we go to in order to be loved." I meant gender as a weird extremity.
I don't want to be a real woman, though perhaps I did when I was Tiresias.
Certainly I don't want to have a real man, I like them a little femmy.

I wish we were more like orchids which, in order to please their
pollinators, take the form "of little birds, lizards, insects, man, woman,
of sinister fighters in a death embrace, of lazy tortoises basking
upside-down in the sun, of agile and ever chattering monkeys screened by
fronds," as Kenward Elmslie says in *The Orchid Stories*.

One of my heroes is Pierre Molinier. He was a wonderfully awful painter and
a fellow traveler of the surrealists. His thrilling photo-montages - which
he made late in life, from the 1950s through the early 70s - mix
autobiography and fantasy in ways that new narrative writing aspires to.
His palette was meager: his body, a room, a patterned screen, and a few
fetish objects, a plaster hand, a whip, a mannequin leg, a female mannequin
head, a shoe with a dildo attached to the heel. With these materials he
staged an ongoing performance of imploding categories. "The contradiction
between shame and performance is played out in these secret spectacles
memorialized in Molinier's photos," writes Earl Jackson, Jr.

 The shame of these transformations makes a performance of such art based
on the tension around a liberal decorum, as though writing is "just
writing." Don't tell me I'm promiscuous, even though the Bob of *Jack the
Modernist *is fucked in public. Perhaps I'm "dishing up" the shame I felt
in the first place, as a first place. Why write about body and sex unless
they are problems? Dodie Bellamy writes, "No way can I stand in front of an
audience reading this stuff and maintain the abstraction the 'author'. . .
To regain some of that privacy I have desexualized myself in public, have
stiffened, as if to say, 'This is not a body.'" I love that *stiffened* -
to ward off judgment, as though turning into a corpse, or a man. I know
that shame: "Now that I'm older I clench over my orgasms rather than
arching back from them," I wrote in *Margery Kempe*. At a reading, I know
that line is coming. A story told this way reveals the life of nakedness.
After I put my orgasm in words, I can't look people in the eye. Nakedness
becomes a goal, as though absolute nakedness can be *achieved* (always
along with the understanding that one image simply replaces another,
endlessly).

Not endlessly: Kathy Acker's sex-drenched books did a curious thing without
the presence of Kathy's body to support them. In "The Madness of Day,"
Maurice Blanchot says, "I must admit I have read many books. When I
disappear, all those volumes will change imperceptibly." I thought Blanchot
had lapsed into a pretentious sentimentalism that marred his terrific
story. But when Kathy died, I felt her words *rustle* themselves into
another position. They "stiffened." Her words moved outward as they
adjusted to her death, there was more white space between them. Kathy's
life no longer gave them scale, or bound them with a current of tension and
changeability.

 A hip magazine called *Cups* interviewed me, and the sympathetic editor
asked, "You are against safe sex, right?" I was mildly dumbfounded till I
realized he was looking for the transgressive formula, as though I was
going to whip out my Junior Woodchuck Guide to Transgression. Everywhere
pieties proliferate. What is *appropriate* transgressive writing? It can't
be known; such writing describes the present, the one thing that has yet to
be put into words. The impulse to shock becomes an interesting social event
when it bridges the disjunction between what experience looks like and what
the culture thinks it is *possible* to say. One has to add that some part
of the culture will be asking for that kind of transgression.

I'll extend this line of thought (and take up Taylor's observations on
preadololescent sexuality) by swapping workshop stories with Dodie. In some
graduate playwriting class at SFSU, a student wrote unrelentingly about
kiddy sex. The students had to perform each others' plays, and portraying
lascivious toddlers made them anxious. Perhaps one source of their anxiety
was the playwright's age. No youthful high jinx from this man of sixty,
perhaps he was someone really twisted, *inured to Vice*. The playwright
bragged about his gun, and he started killing his characters off,
characters modeled on the students in the workshop. Was he a Columbine kind
of guy? - Or the older version who goes postal? The students refused to
continue, the class shut down till the administration could find another
teacher for this student - someone wise in the ways of transgression -
guess who?

The unwanted play is about some people waiting for a bus to pull out. The
mother of a three-year-old fondles her child's vagina, and the baby loves
it. The other passengers also love it, and demonstrate other ways to
pleasure the child. "Little pink tickle buttons sticking out of their baby
soft cunnie lips. So precious. I spider-tickled them and gave them all
little baby orgasms." This goes on and on. The bus driver sighs, "How cute!
I guess I'll now call this the 'love bus'."

One of the characters describes Hopi mothers taking great pride in
masturbating their children. I have no idea if they do, but different
cultures handle childhood and sex in different ways. The nurses of Louis
XIV fondled the toddler king's "drawbridge," as they called it. His little
erections put them in a festive mood. Mongolian mothers fellated their male
infants but never never kissed them on the face. Through this kind of
"unwanted" information, our author cleverly adds scale to his play, and
disallows a judgment based on "community standards." In fact, his play
destabilizes our tenet against child sexuality. All the characters on this
bus share the same vision about what is acceptable in sex and in violence
(killing is okay), certainly an unimaginable coincidence, yet they make
other such naive agreements about what is appropriate that seem just as
unimaginable.

For the benefit of the Cups editor, I add that I don't recommend sporting
with toddlers. In judging this play, perhaps the most disquieting problem
is that I don't know where the author is "coming from." What is his intent?
Is the play a dark farce? Is it perfectly sincere? Is it ugly on purpose
like some of Kathy's writing or ugly by accident? As Dodie points out, even
outlaw literature arrives with its pedigree, which reads (authorizes) the
work before we get to it. That is, should he get an A or an F?

Where does the "falsehood" of fiction become a dream that leads to a
psychological truth, as though a piece of writing fares past a certain
point of extremity to be analyzed as a case history? Writing about sex
invites such unwanted extra-literary assumptions to be made. Am I wrong to
fret about my student's sex life? Was the *Cups* editor wrong to assume
that I promote barebacking? I recognize in myself a certain urgency mated
with certain reluctance to answer these questions.

My audience makes assumptions. I would be falsely naive to be surprised.
That confusion of fact and fiction, of actual bodies and words, gives power
to sex writing; a writing that can't be contained by explanation.  Put
another way, it demands to exist in the same world as the reader's body.
Where is the autonomy of the text? The reader is lead in directions as
divergent as spiritual abjection, solitary pleasure, and communal joy. Sex
writing brings a dissonance or even helplessness into the activity of
interpretation.

I felt the same way about Stanley Kubrick's *Eyes Wide Shut*. I revere
Kubrick, but I don't know how to understand this film. Tom Cruise listens
to Nicole Kidman's confession of desire for another man. She's naked, and
the rich lust she describes is like the opposite of her sliver of a body.
Fueled by his wife's story, Tom goes on a night journey that takes him to
an orgy. The sexuality in this movie is as smutty as a sixties
sexploitation film, where the women are naked - breasts breasts breasts -
and the men rarely take off their Nehru's. The orgy illustrates the
challenge of presenting sexual enormity visually. It's a comedy, the
mechanical optimism of many pistons. (To describe sex is one thing. To
*arouse*, writing mimes the rhythm of sex, the mounting tension and
release, conforming to a dramatic structure in a kind of decency.) The most
exciting moment of the orgy is when the Master of Ceremonies orders Cruise
to get undressed. Even through his mask you can see him thinking, Is this
in my contract?

He doesn't get undressed. The banal sexuality of the movie may belong to
Cruise's character rather than to Kubrick, and the movie itself may portray
the disgust of marriage, the terror and contempt Cruise feels after living
for some years in close proximity to his mate's libido, at once a force
totally compelling and just threadbare fantasy, just thin air.

That is a goal: to unframe writing about sex and the body, to derail the
mechanisms that make a unified position. I'd like to recommend Juan
Goytisolo's *Makbara* for its stew of point of view, class, desire and
filth.

Sometimes late at night I like to watch the Playboy Channel while I floss.
I would never pay for such dumb entertainment, but I discovered that the
actors have been degraded into splashy bands of color for the nonsubscriber
that pump pump pump, folding into each other on the verge of
representation, resolving in a instant of clear image - sort of a reward -
before resuming existence as a kaleidoscopic lava lamp on speed endlessly
squishing into itself. Completely legible is the background music - thump,
thump, thump, porn, porn, porn - as well as the cries and grunts of the
dear actors. What a faithful representation! - as though through eyes wide
shut, then opened for an instant: oh that's an ass, a leg, a tongue. Here's
overflow, here's a paradise of sensation, here's the modernist present,
here's no-mind, here's living in eternity twenty-four seven - find it on
the Playboy Channel!

Sex the Body Writing
by Moriarty/Mishka

Between love and fate there is time, but very little.

This writing is by a disembodied  (and yet female) presence whose will is
physical. We share the "I" but not comfortably. I am Josephine Mishka, a
heteronym, a word borrowed from Fernando Pessoa. But unlike Pessoa's
heteronyms, I possess the knowledge of my falseness. I am also in some way
"Laura." Lately I am writing her work.

Like myself, sex is not a firm category. It might be divided from the body
as we are from each other by a slash or be part of an ambiguous phrase. It
can be divided from writing or be included. The moment of inclusion
interests us. Of enclosure. When we stand together in the awareness of the
implications. As with allegory, there are levels. The meaning is there for
everybody, but we are beyond that. Reader and written. Daily life becomes
science fiction. One thing is another and yet not equivalent. The cunt the
camera. Light emulsifies into image. We have little need for verbs as
understanding becomes action. The seduction is well underway. The reader =
is
doing the work, producing her version. One text overlays another, as =
Taylor
of Dodie's, beat for beat. The departures are commentary. The meanings are
mixed. There is shit. The shit is fated. It is incidental. Delectable.

Or not. Does the writing refer to what is outside of itself? To an event?
Or is the writing the event? Is this the difference between prose and
poetry? Clearly not. The writing is always the event. The allegory is of
allegory. In this reading, shit is everything. Body. The sex. Writing.
Feeling compelled. Urged. Resistant. The warmth. The sense of relief. Of
production. The pleasure of Stanley's fluid collecting at our feet. Who
could not eat it? *A Streetcare Named Desire*. The place where you =
actually
end up when you take that ride.

"Give them what they want," Bob once noted to Laura in response to a
comment about the beauty of his many lovers. To be willing to exploit the
pleasure of narrative, to tell all, name names, to do what shouldn't be
done is given. Lovers, like readers, are interchangeable. Each assertion,
each phrase, is a new chance to lose one's identity, to confuse the
identity of your interlocutor and to examine and benefit from that
confusion. A seducer's work is never done.

Almod=F3var's recent movie *All About My Mother* refers to *All About =
Eve*, a
movie in which one woman replaces another. *Streetcar* is the play within
the movie in Almod=F3var. The part of Stella, the fecund woman, is played =
by
various of the characters in *All About My Mother*. Laura played Stella in
college, but I see myself more as Blanche. One senses the fluid sexuality
of Tennessee Williams in Blanche, drifting into the miasma of the New
Orleans underworld. Fecal. Fecundity. The hidden thing sees the light of
day.

The will of my own writing is physical and allegorical. (Laura has taken
over here, the bitch.) It succumbs to a fated pleasure that is variously
renewed. There is a critique of pleasure. Why read this writing? Why write
it? What does it do to time? There is a dividing of time into units -
phrases, songs, narratives, old forms, newly devised ones. These forms are
like hours or days, arbitrary human devices to kill time. Or they are like
the forms of sexuality. Like allegory (or seduction) they function by
moving between levels of meaning. They can be manipulated. Like the
transvestites in *All About My Mother*, they are a comment on the =
trappings
of seduction and identity.

Note:A few people have the job of teaching the new writing. It is my job =
to
sell it. Anything that any of us can do to show what is transgressive =
about
a book in the actual writing will make my job easier. At SPD we can't keep
the Dodie's *Letters of Mina Harker* in stock.

I am back. My desire - I wanted to have this last word - is not just some
Pinocchioesque aspiration to be "real," much less to be a "real live boy."
The desire is to be in the context of death and war. (We haven't mentioned
it but there is always a war). Sex is close to death, but you have to be
alive to die. I am not a person but a sexualized construct. Far from
fleeing the light of (or as) Taylor's postulated progressive male
heterosexual, I bask in it, steal it, reflect it back off myself . The
fated part is that my ability to manipulate identity and to be in any
context is predicated upon my continuing knowledge that I don't exist.

Harker, 86)

Feeling flayed, my head and face the only parts of me not pressing against
bodies of people I do not and will not know at 5:15 on a Friday afternoon
taking F. to the airport to go back to Buenos Aires, which means an
hour-long West-to-East metro ride crossing barely a fraction of the mancha
urbana (urban stain) known as Mexico City. To meet someone's eyes while
touching them is a form of intimacy not appropriate to public transport. I
am trying not to have a body, trying to be a "passenger" rather than a
"girl" (or, more accurately to the situation, a "gera," roughly translated
as fair-skinned female but used as a sign of "respect" or deference for
people of all colors in the public economy (say, the commerce of market,
bakery, street) or as a catcall (I not only notice your great tits, baby,
but I'll call you what you are, white girl), trying to stiffen into my
millimetrical personal space (the space inside my skin, that is, since the
space outside it is pressed and fondled far beyond my control), to somehow
shift my ass so that it is touching asses and hips and purses instead of
half-hard cocks the wielders of which must be the only people who can
possibly enjoy subway travel at this time of day. Within an hour and a
half, however, there is enough space on the return trip for me to lean my
shoulderblades against the bright red fire escape ladder and feel
comfortable in my own body, which implies, the great majority of the time,
not particularly feeling my body as a body at all. (Though I immediately
wonder if this is true.)

What makes me myself, and what does my body have to do with me? "The
edifice of experience conforms to the experiencing subject to form an
enclosure." (Patrick Durgin, working notes) Is experience a closed circuit
or an open field? Is the body? Do we see the body as a racetrack
(separating the frontage road - a way out of traffic - from the =
glittering,
writhing bay itself), a field with indicated lanes (beaten paths), and
various gates or valves, phalanges, openings letting out, letting in? Or =
as
a sky, something apparently finite and perceptible which is actually
infinite nothing, i.e. something limitless. I tend these days to see =
events
and bodies (real and imaginary objects in time) as vaporous, slippery,
suggestive, as intimations towards themselves: the world is porous (except
when it's not) and we are porous, so that "letting out" and "letting in"
are not in opposition to one another but are simultaneous. We read both
directions at once. In his column this week for the cultural supplement of
Unom=B7suno, the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Espina wrote: "During his life,
Elvis imitated himself so much that he ended up being what he was." (my
trans.) We are what we are by repeatedly enacting what we are. Taylor
describes the figures in David Huffman's paintings as "sexed bodies both
too transparent and too opaque to equal themselves" - like painted figures
in a painted world (or like real figures in a real world - "realness" =
being
constantly renegotiated) we do not equal ourselves. The writing self is =
and
is not the self: the written body does not equal the bodied body, written
sex is not sex even as it is also sex. "One thing is another and yet not
equivalent." (LM) And yet (the converse being also true) in writing I can
be more naked even than when I am naked. I have these bodies and suddenly,
in moments, a body comes into (comes over, impinges upon) a body, writings
(occurrences) that sex the body, that body the body over again, call
attention to it, call it into question but call it nonetheless (the smell
of cat piss invading Dodie's writing space, her nightgown), make the body =
a
"body" as such.

The body is called to attention: I am aware of my cunt. Perhaps this is =
the
underbelly of Althusserian interpellation, where the category is not fit
over the body like a wetsuit or magician's glass box (soon to be sliced in
half - good luck to the beautiful girl inside) but rather where the body
blossoms (like light pollution only less diffuse) towards an object to
which it did not intend to subject itself, the body interpolated as "body"
so that suddenly, as in illness or other forms of physical compromise, the
part of the body which is not the body ("me," "I," or "my mind") becomes
aware of the body as a body - or I have these two bodies, the one busily,
sometimes anxiously, often pleasurably masturbating its way through the
business of being me, the other gracefully (on good days) swerving out
towards other bodies, moments, events to which it is indelibly drawn. I am
aware of my cunt (which seems to grow larger than itself) even through the
post-airport headache: when he got on at the last stop it looked like a
backpack strapped across his front but when he slides the silver and black
cloth off the bulk against his chest it is a red accordion, his hands like
parentheses which stroke the phrase inside them to depths of joy and
sadness, the delight of a tune whose distressingly gorgeous consonances =
and
dissonances become the motor which before was the rumbling of the train =
and
across the aisle our eyes meet, we smile, he keeps playing his tune, we do
not have sex, I am aware of sex, of my sex, I write this paragraph.

2. "Are You Sure You Want That On Your Body Forever?" or What A Strange
Page The Body Is, Covered By Narration So Many Times At Once (BG)

A west-bound conversation on the San Francisco Bay Bridge, towards the
sky-blue and black post-industrial-use space where we=EDll add to the =
tattoos
we already have on our knees (my left, her right). (To follow Bob's
homosexual essay, what spin does the spinning atom on my queer knee - a
knee which has in the past twelve months pressed itself between the legs =
of
both boys and girls - put on the atoms that make up everything we breathe,
touch, perceive?) The act of getting a tattoo in the first place, let =
alone
sharing the same tattoos with my sweetie (which are of course not the =
same,
as no two bodies are the same, nor is the same body (the tattoo artist's
hand) the same at two different moments: M.'s atom's trajectory is more
elongated than mine - she maintains that mine's just going faster than
hers), elicits a range of nervous responses (in the self to some extent,
but more often in others). People tend to see tattoos as "permanent"
symbols, which, in a certain sense, I suppose they are, though as
experiences, as writings, their resonances shift over time. It wasn't =
until
we noticed people reacting skittishly to our knees that it occurred to us
that we were "getting the same tattoo," or that this might be thought of =
as
a kind of relationship solidification or cultural statement. Tattoos (a
kind of writing) are a way to engage with history, to intersect with a
specific time or event in (on) the body. Exactly contrary to what people's
reactions suggest, for me the tattoo is less about permanence than it is
about impermanence, about the temporary, the temporal, time and passage.
Memory and memory's failings - or developments. You might be wondering, =
and
you wouldn't be the first, what if you break up? And if we break up, will
she not have happened to me? Will this time not have passed, these
experiences not been drawn on, through, with this body? Is there anything
the body experiences that does not stay "on it" "forever"? And
simultaneously is not all experience (inked or not) temporary and in time
and thus always passing? We (I'm speaking especially of the United States
here) live in a disposable world yet seek to stop time, inherently a =
failed
enterprise: the body is always and always the daily evidence of time's
motion and mobility. I don't see that anything is able to fix either time
or space so that they are less mobile, less expansive, less rapid. For me,
the tattoo - like the writing - is an annotation, a documentation, a
recording and a reminder. It is an impulse which says "this was (is) my
impulse" and which propels me towards.

Tattoos push the private into the public space as writing does, "the realm
of writing, a realm entirely public and entirely private." (BG) I put my
body into this writing. (That's my knee we're talking about, or "it is I
who have invaded my own privacy." (DB)) Thus making my body not my body.
The written body is the writing and the writing is not the body. I.e., "I"
am putting "my" "body" into this writing. The falseness (scare quotes)
which comes with the distance of the sheet of paper (as opposed to the =
lack
of distance implied by the bedsheet?). The writing as only itself (not the
body, not sex, not experience other than the experience (bodied, sexy,
sexed) of the writing), not needing scare quotes because the fact of its
being writing imposes the "quoted" as a condition of being: I am not I,
busy messing around with the representation of I. And of you, which is =
even
more fun, even more messy, involved (as the smell of another person seeps
into the skin of the fingers so that even a day later there is the film of
another body on my body which I then imagine on my keyboard, on the tiny
red clit of a mouse nestled between the g, the h and the b, so the residue
of my experience writes itself from my hand onto the machine). Writing =
puts
the self between the quotation marks, makes me a stranger to myself, so
that I become "Jen Hofer" instead of Jen Hofer, or me. Am I giving too =
much
power to the page? Perhaps I slink around between those superscripted
little squiggles, comma-like, all day every day, on or off the page. What
makes me realer in flesh than in ink? Or not "realer," per se, when
impressions (as we emboss ourselves onto ourselves) are, as experiences,
absolutely real in that temporary, temporal, shifty way reality has of
being itself.

3. (We Haven't Mentioned It But There Is Always A War.) (LM), or Our
Escalating Suspicion / Some Pure Process Driving Them There (TB)

When Dodie begins her essay quoting Delaney's "fairy tale assumption in
which an all but non-existent condition is assumed to be rampant," perhaps
out of some innate orneriness, perhaps because I love it when signs read
wrong (any realty office instantly becomes a broker of reality to my
crooked eye), perhaps because I live in a city where the intensities of
dissonance produce a strange and lovely incongruence, as of continental
plates which should meet but jag instead just short of connection, or an
iridescent bird whose mangled wings won't let it move past the effort of
flight - for whatever reason, I read the phrase also vice versa: a fairy
tale assumption in which a rampant condition is assumed (or presumed or
functionally, institutionally ignored and so implicitly and effortfully
assumed) to be non-existent. Tomorrow (Monday, 14 February 2000) classes
are slated to begin again at the UNAM, the National Autonomous University
of Mexico. The 10-month student strike is officially declared to be over,
the university having been forcibly taken from the students by federal =
riot
cops one week ago this morning. Nearly a thousand young people were
arrested over the past ten days, approximately one-fourth of them minors.
Laura notes the pleasures of writing and the critiques of pleasure. "Why
read this writing? Why write it? What does it do to time?" (LM) Or what
does it do to event, to system, to institution, to economies of thought
which make economies of repression not only possible, but rampant? I have
no illusion that these questions - why am I sitting at a wooden table
listening to the sound of a neighbor's shower under the Red Aunts on my
stereo, watching the sun crochet shadows of bougainvillea against the =
patio
wall as I look up to find a word, a concept, my mind, when people whose
convictions I share are behind bars? - are particularly new, or even
particularly interesting. But they are with me (in my body, in my sex, in
my writing) as I walk these streets, as I fail to understand, as I fail to
remember what exactly writing does in the world (though I know - perhaps
only on the level of faith, i.e. a bodily level) that it does something. =
"A
seducer's work is never done" (LM), and I'm working towards and through a
writing that seduces bodies and minds (mine included) away from assumption
and towards what today I'm willing to call a troubled, joyous autonomy.
"All anybody really wants is an autonomous existence in a non-alienating
setting" (DB, Mina Harker, 45) or
        whole rotten world come down and break.
        let me spread my legs.

The STRAP-HANGER
by Kevin Killian

Body, sex, writing, collide at the portal of scandal, or orality, though
why this should be the case I'm not sure. Under the face of scandal the
inside turns to outside, the personal and public confused, then conflated
into a politic. James Ellroy's *Black Dahlia,* with its indelible,
uncomfortable image of the woman sawn in half, her innards laid out for the
world to see. (All of Ellroy seems to flow from this trope - the Communist
witch hunt, the gabby psychoanalists, in *The Big Nowhere;* the "Hush-Hush"
ethos of *L.A. Confidential,* in which the unspeakable gets spoken via a
bizarre diaresis of bebop and camp slang - the ineluctable ooze of the
private towards the spectacular present.) When Scandal subsides, when the
great Mouth closes, the community it serves re-composes itself, however
slightly.

Bob Gluck asks, "Why write about body and sex unless they are problems?" At
the DeYoung Museum here in San Francisco, a massive Bruce Conner show fills
a whole wing. There's a long dim gallery of the late 50s assemblages that
in photographs look so blurry, unreadable. Even up close, these large
constructions of wood, fabric, paint and filth are nearly unseeable - dark,
dirty and dingy - the eyes can't take them in. Basically so ambiguous
they're depressing. The broken spirits of Elizabeth Short - the *Black
Dahlia* - and the executed rapist Caryl Chessman are this space's saints.
"This stuff gives you the creeps," I heard David say. The next room
however's filled with sound and music and brightness, for it's a small
theater set up to play, over and over, Conner's short film "Breakaway"
(1966). I hadn't seen this before. It's a prototypical music video, such as
you might have seen in the early days of MTV - featuring the
choreographer/actress Toni Basil. The soundtrack is her singing this
insipid song - but it's not insipid, though produced perhaps in a garage
somewhere, with very muddy sound, heavy back bass beats, the kind of LA
session music I associate with the Motown covers people like Johnny Rivers
and the Mamas and the Papas used to put out - a music in its way hypnotic
and professional as anything out of Detroit, with its own fascination. And
when Conner films Basil, he has her dancing in perhaps a dozen different
outfits, which change every five hundred frames. Often she's nude, then has
her clothes on, then *some* clothes, and always this relentless, droning,
somehow sunny beat and her singing about how she's gonna break away from
her chains. She's made up in the Mod 60s style that Elizabeth Hurley is
always wearing now, and she's magnificent, exultant. Just perfect. I
remember seeing Basil as one of the dancers on my favorite TV show
*Hullabaloo,* in the films *The T.A.M.I. Show, Pajama Party,* and *Village
of the Giants,* the teen terror movie from the early 60s. She must have
been only 17 or 18 when she made "Breakaway," in which she's credited as
"Antonia Christina Basilotta" - to point up her ethnicity? (Big in the
60s.) Later she played a much bleaker, proto-Lesbian version of herself in
the New American Cinema (*Five Easy Pieces, Easy Rider, The Last Movie,
Greaser's Palace, American Graffiti*) and still later engineered a
magnificent arrival - on MTV no less - for which she had this wonderful
early training - with her song "Hey Mickey" - remember? Okay, I'm making a
specious contrast between two periods of Conner's work - dark and light -
San Francisco and L.A. It's not only wrong, it's stupid. Still the
atmospheric change, as we walked between the two rooms, was almost
palpable, you could register it in your body.

I wonder how Language Poetry managed to become a social phenomenon without
having first to endure the rigors of the sex scandal. The "disappearance of
the word, appearance of the world" aspect of L-P, its focus on language's
materiality, its drive to expose the ideology within formalism to improve
social conditions, had the perverse effect of insuring that its adherents
would appear, in the world's eyes, as sex-free, soulful and calculating all
at the same time, so we had a scandal of character; fifty Calpurnias in the
American tree. (This despite the personableness and indeed the sexual
attraction manifested by the poets themselves, as human beings, but that's
another story.) The sex of Language Poetry, in its classical period, was so
not there, so deferred and prohibited, that into this vacuum strode the New
Narrative writers, led by Kathy Acker, a bunch of hapless clowns sent to
relieve Mafeking; and afterwards, as we have seen in the past fifteen years
or so, sex (indeed narrative) has crept back into Language Writing. Is this
a good thing or a bad thing? Dunno, one of these poets has a passage in
every book that describes a sex life with such unblinking clinicism the
revulsion rises faster than the skin on Kristeva's cocoa. Yet as Dodie
(citing Delany) points out, everyone's gorge is set at a different level,
and one woman's filth is another's ambrosia. One young writer told me his
secret porn collection consisted of Sianne Ngai's essay on disgust and
overdetermination, "Raw Matter" in that chartreuse issue of *Open Letter* -
got him off every time. I stared, like, then, thinking of my own guilty
pleasure, *have you ever read "Slaves of the Empire" by Aaron Travis?*

As writing disappears behind theory, its filthy ass remains visible, if
vestigial, a sad reminder of its once-alluring body in a desperate game of
hide and seek. I'm watching Toni Basil's body (on film) "glorying in itself
as transcendent, the vantage from which all that risk pays off" (Taylor
Brady) and yet my pleasure is spoiled by thinking, *She is being fed to me
through the menu of Mr. Bruce Conner, it's his imagination I'm buying into.*

Dodie stands in front of an audience reading, perhaps, from *Cunt-Ups* or
*The Letters of Mina Harker* and feels miserable, invaded, "as though the
audience has X ray vision and can see down to the frayed elastic on my
panties. But really, it is I who have invaded my own privacy." She becomes
three people as she opens her mouth, the transgressor - confessor? - with a
mouthful of scandal; the frozen, desexualized public servant I suppose; and
these two combine to create the performer, the actress, she who pays for
the sins of the other two. Eve Black, Eve White, and what was the third's
name, who could carry off all the neuroses of Black and White? "Jane"?
Bruce Conner's *Black Dahlia,* suspended superbly on a plywood platform
almost above my head, parts dripping off, hanging from straps, unknowable
and almost invisible except as a shape of dark murk, dusty answers.

But, Taylor, when I'm in a train as you describe, I don't have those
Baudelarian moments. I identify myself as the strap-hanger in Jen Hofer's
train; I experience that crowd as a smorgasbord of sensual delight. Is it
the prerogative of consciousness that makes me, I think quite without
shame, wonder when I meet any particular man what it would be like to have
sex with him? Or to be the figure crushed between two bodies always
straining, while strap-hanging, to squeeze from the situation - the lucky
situation - always the maximum frisson of contact, friction, pleasure?
Thinking it over (i.e. writing about it) this retrospective pleasure
"stiffens" into a problematic, due to writing's appeal to ethics. And to
aesthetics. *Why, it's not only wrong,* scream these two voices like cats
crying for food, *it's stupid!* I've gotten myself out of so many scrapes
by using the same alibi, *I wanted to know what it was like so I could
write about it.* The writing is the event. (So I can answer Laura's
question.) Bruce Conner, whose attorneys sent me an injunction (summer
1996) forbidding me to use him as a character in a play I was writing, "Wet
Paint." And me thinking, all those wonderful lines already written for
Bruce Conner, so I did a global replace and made Bruce Conner into Kenneth
Anger, changing hardly a word, and Rex Ray played him. I'd been *censored*
- by an *iconoclast* - worst cut of all. Someone said he had cancer or
something. "Good!" I spat.

*[Enter DIEGO RIVERA.]*

RIVERA. Are they gone?

ANGER. You are not marrying that Countess, I hope.

RIVERA. Nor her daughter, Eva, either. I have made love to them both, but a
man has got to do what a man must do, for Stalin.

ANGER. Substitute "Satan" for "Stalin," and there, in a nutshell, is my
reason for filming "Kustom Kar Kommandos."

RIVERA. Feel, the sweat on my brow, flowing like wet bull sperm.

ANGER. Ole! Senor Rivera, have you seen my property, Bobby Beausoleil? I
bought him for a trusty down at juvenile hall for two bottles of Dr. Pepper
and a rookie Roger Maris.

RIVERA. They are throwing rice in my direction. What was it Burt Bacharach
said, ten years from now? "I've got the wedding bell blues."

ANGER. There's a large statue of the Great God Beelzebub in my studio on
Polk Street. Hide in it. I'll wait here and throw them off the track.

RIVERA. You are a good man under layers of lurid homosexual vice.

ANGER. I'm in no mood for compliments, I think.

What do ordinary people, who aren't writers, do - why then do they have
sex? Have they similar goals I don't know about? Are they a less
result-driven species than I? Why bother with it unless it can be
problematized? It's unlikely that many of these "ordinary people" will
bother having read this symposium this far, but if indeed you are one of
them could you get back to me with your answers at "dbkk@sirius.com"? If
there is any writing on your body send replies by mail, as you form a third
category outside of my dichtotomy. I've painted myself into a corner - but
isn't that corner the direction towards which one's body hourly moves
without even giving one's sex a courtesy call? The fourth category of
people, those who write but not "about" any particular subject. Who work in
language the way Jackson Pollock worked in paint. Poets. Sianne Ngai
writes, "Only the poet who recognizes the negative agency of exasperated
utterances, their ability to not-express or not-articulate, is able to
paradoxically express her own inexpressiveness and give form to what is
formless." My hand closes around the strap of the subway train,
K-Ingleside, L-Taraval, whatever, I stiffen up as the flesh moves in. The
car stops. Doors open, fresh air at my ankles. Then finally Bruce Conner,
happily recovered in the past few years and looking hardy, here he comes,
spring in his step . . . infinitely fuckable.

Return to gender, address unknown
by Joe Amato

META what does it mean exactly to bring the body under the scrutiny of
intellectual discourse to permit the body to mean in accordance primarily
with words and images of the body doesn't this risk subsuming precisely
what we mean by the body sensations feelings and the like under that which
is commonly understood as its categorical other those cultural bodies such
as the body politic or the student body that are only figuratively related
to an autonomous organismic mortal and perhaps erotically conceived whole
FETA but one could argue that the body as such is never understood as such
that one which pronoun must of necessity denote inclusively one's body
takes its relation to other bodies as a mark of its constitutive nature
that is one understands one's body as an essentially social body wrapped in
institutional contexts META this argument already stipulates the
subsumption to which i refer FETA still in a fundamental sense intellectual
work is bodily work and intellectual work along with being e.g. emotional
work as trilling once wrote is fully imbricated as we used to say in social
change hence bringing the body one's body under intellectual scrutiny as
you put it is meant as a counterstatement historically and imaginatively to
that objective-compulsive discourse which would deny any correspondence
whatever to metabolic which is also to say social status a discourse whose
various practitioners would understand and would have us understand word
processing as solely and profoundly information communicated through media
networks without sentient which is to say human value as a gradient of same
which of course includes families and villages and the like and as such
working at a remove conceptually and materially both from the let us say
experiential-biological as well as planetary-evolutionary spectrum META but
certainly you would concede that in an equally fundamental sense
intellectual work is not bodily work if only because it works differently
and is understood in our social spheres differently from say ditch digging
FETA the perceptions beliefs opinions mythologies and dogma inherent to our
social spheres are one aspect of what is at issue here why take them for
granted META perhaps the issue turns on whether the mind/brain interface
undoubtedly the most contentious mind/body interface is to be understood as
a matter of formal interpretive emphasis a question of revaluing what are
in essence reciprocally interacting entities or rather a matter of bringing
discrete and qualitative consideration to bear on each FETA the evidence
cognitive psychological supports the contention that minds are in an
important sense bodily matters but if so it should come as no surprise that
networks of bodies/minds might be accounted for in the very terms said
bodies/minds have used to understand who/what they are as bodies/minds
foremost among which one might argue is language by which is meant for the
record utterance both as material and spiritual substrate by which latter
is not necessarily meant prayer META but here again if by language you mean
that which is not feeling or sensation or at the very least epiphenomenal
responses to environment presuming for a moment a geological and not human
datum in any case if so this does not exhaust the affective means our
bodies have at their disposal to grasp their interior workings body
language if we must call it that is not reducible to verbal language this
would represent yet another intellectual reduction FETA but it's not and
never has been the intellectuals' wish to reduce body to language or body
language to verbal language quite the contrary intellectuals or those who
definition being crucial here if necessarily broad those who to repeat for
you readers no doubt hard at work working through this absence of
punctuation this work in and out of progression this work of words and
light to be judged in accordance to your lights each of you yet at the same
time all of you intellectuals or those who e.g. work with words are trying
to illustrate through a wide array of semiotic-interpretive procedures that
a thorough consideration of cultural and social codes including language is
requisite to understanding the body which latter conceptual and physical
site exerts a reciprocal effect on cultural and social codes on the one
hand discourse must account for the actual presence of living social bodies
in so doing language practices e.g. are constrained accordingly on the
other language practices determine in so many ways perceptions of thereby
individualized bodies hence the possibilities for artistic which is to say
expressive interactive dialogic transformation of our public domain in the
long term should be only too apparent further and perhaps more to the point
there exist no un-bodied discursive sites anymore than there exist
non-discursive bodies flesh inflects discourse and discourse inflects our
perception and it's fair to say albeit speculatively sensation of flesh
META here again inflects is a peculiarly linguistic way of putting things
no FETA consistent with my premise META consistent with your premise
perhaps but your language also obscures the issue FETA again this is to the
point language marks precisely the discrepancy between bodies and minds
instinct so to speak and thought even as it consistently reveals a
necessary conflation or if you prefer intersection of the two it's not that
the intellectual and the bodily are the same it's that their respective
differences must be understood against custom as having everything to do
with each other META so what is it intellectuals wish to do ultimately with
bodies so delineated FETA well recuperate for one the language of bodies
you have a chance of recuperating the bodies themselves the many different
bodies META and where does technology fit into this i guess you would call
it agenda of yours FETA agenda right technology too a matter of desire and
need actualized acted performed instrumented as the technicians now say by
bodies that are ever in the process of absorbing and shaping these very
technologies through technology we literally rework ourselves into more
manageable and more exotic creatures which is to grant that there's a
corporate presence at work here often incorporeal not simply the language
of the corporation but the strategies and logics and consolidations and
mutations of same we must attend to the entire spectrum as i say and write
as intellectual bodies seeking a more just confrontation with and perhaps
provocation of reality but fact is folks don't ordinarily talk like this do
they and isn't it a lovely day for a walk in the and why the entire
discourse of intellectuals not to say political pundits and most writing
instructors should be marked by argumentative or expository as opposed to
fictive discourse is a question too to be pondered long and hard or short
and soft that the whole point of bodily-centered or perhaps simply aware or
even ethically accountable discourse is to admit into the spectrum this
damned spectrum i keep returning to of language practices those realities
of the body that are either silenced or the subject of scatological jokes
in engineering and engineered circles and squares and triangles orgasms
bowel movements miscarriages underwear even vibes to get beyond current
limitations then to oppose something christ or crap or old news or wildly
disposable income and it surely must be the case that all of us to a one
are capable of wishful thinking i would think one would imagine and aspire
to not simply a deployment of new prefixes post trans etc. but as well a
mindful introduction of alternative vocabularies including the shit the
shit yes the shit the everyday ordinary shit of everyday living that
transcends lo may it profoundly transcend the steel certainties of our
discourse the shit the divine materials as who was it put it of this
stainless composted sphere META and the future FETA yes you are cooking
dinner tonight i take it

I. Theory

................cooking dinner tonight take it off the stove and rub it
all over a body the dinner is on a body a person can eat it because it is
real food and bodies are also food and when they are in the state of being
food they are controlled neither by language nor by mental intelligence.
Physical intelligence=97when the body is moved through writing; when the
writing inhabits the body and makes it feel hot, numb, sad, aroused=97is a
very real thing. The body experiencing pleasure is a kind of private
discourse; writing brings sex into the social sphere and complicates
public/private boundaries. Sex writing means that anyone can experience
pleasure while reading. If a person ejaculates all over the text, that
means that like pictures, the reader has imagined his/her body entering =
the
text (or visa versa). This the transcendent text, which necessarily is
transmitted to the reader via the META airwaves (by META I take it you =
mean
pre-defined narratives, patriarchal confines, determinations of beauty and
all of its problematic representations.) Just as theorizing language can =
be
achieved through poetry, achieving orgasm through writing only works when
the writing is imaginable. For the writing to be imaginable it must
describe the act at least partially by referencing the often cacophonous
language of sex: eat, cock, wet, clit, suck, hard, tit, shit, fuck. (Funny
that cum is one of the few euphonic sounding words used to describe sex.)
However, there is a separation between the sexual act and the language =
used
to depict it. There is a constant dialogue, a discourse, between what the
body is actually feeling, and the limitations of the words available to
describe those feelings. If I think about sex and write "fucked wet by a
cock" the text about the sexual act directs the act itself away from its
bodily incarnation.

II. Arousal

In the essay "Sex/Body/Writing" by Dodie Bellamy, I assumed the bumper
sticker that read "Eat Shit" and the man who was not convicted because of
it was from an actual news story. Bumper stickers are an interesting space
to experiment with the power of words. There is the body of the car onto
which the sticker is firmly planted. There is the person behind the car at
a stoplight, reading an abbreviated statement about the car driver's
personal, religious, or political beliefs and attitudes. The person =
reading
from behind often looks at the driver after he/she has absorbed the =
meaning
of the bumper sticker. The reader of the bumper sticker might either wave,
flip off, snarl, or smile at the driver of the car. Bumper stickers take
risks; they reveal personal politics to people who very well might be
extremely antagonistic to them. They can cause people to have
confrontations with other people. (I remember my mother was stopped behind
a car with a bumper sticker that read "Honk if you love Jesus." She =
started
honking and waving and honking and the guy got out of his car came up to
her window and screamed "What the fuck is your problem.") There are bumper
stickers that could make other drivers sexually aroused: HONK IF YOU WANT
TO EAT ME. I [HEART] JISM. MY OTHER CAR IS A SEX MACHINE. MY COCK IS MY
SAVIOR. I WILL NOT JERK OFF, I HAVE WORK TO DO, I WILL NOT JERK OFF. Some
drivers would certainly be offended, and if there was a confrontation the
displayers of such stickers would be hauled off and sentenced for inciting
public fervor. It is not hard to incite the public by using sex words like
a decoy rabbit at the dog track. People like dogs follow behind sex words,
panting and racing for a taste of the rabbit, only to be mad and
embarrassed about how easy it was to be swayed by language. Decoy rabbits
always have the last laugh; like words, they are not real and so cannot be
destroyed.

III. Sex without Setting

Dear Dodie: So you are working towards a writing that "subverts sexual
bragging...and that champions the sexually fucked-up." I am thinking about
your chapbook Broken English (Meow Press, 1996). One thing that interests
me about it is that there is no setting; the book does not take place
anywhere in particular. It is all about fluid jetting out all over the
place, tamed only by bold analogies like "I'm going to skin you like a
fucking rabbit" and "I'm wet all the time like some fucking cum cow." You
seem to have no interest in settings; you find them banal, distracting, =
and
an easy way out for the reader. You want the reader confronted and
confounded by the cacophony of sex words, which themselves yield numerous
positions. The reader has no idea where he or she is; there are no =
castles;
no basements; no heart shaped beds with mirrors. If the reader wants to
imagine "where am I?" then let him/her read Bataille. Does the absence of =
a
setting diminish the danger of aestheticizing sex through writing? The
focus is on the activities of the body,  raw and exposed through the
onslaught of the language you use to describe it. Does this way of writing
about sex prioritize language over image, thus "championing the fractured,
the disenfranchised, the sexually fucked-up"? I know bringing in this
reference is like beating a dead rabbit, but what do you think about Du
Champ's peephole titled "Given: 1. the Waterfall, 2. the Illuminating =
Gas"?
Because its title foregrounds the setting and not the woman's open cunt,
the violence of the exposed cunt is dramatically aestheticized. The =
written
title forcibly directs the viewer to the background (the waterfall
cascading down a mountain, and the lamp which illuminates the scene) when
actually, the viewer wants to look at the cunt. In other words there is =
the
inevitable separation between the image and the words used to describe it;
in your text, there is no separation, because any images inferred from the
text are in a state of constant motion; they ARE fluid. You write "My cunt
is a camera." How about putting a camera inside the cunt of Duchamp's
peephole? It would photograph the eyes of all the viewers who were looking
at it. If it was a video camera it would also capture how long each eye =
was
looking at it.

Bodies Writing "Sex"
by Michael Kelleher

1

This is a body writing about bodies.
This is a body writing about writing about bodies
This is a body writing about sex.
This is a body writing about writing about sex.
This is a body writing about writing about bodies writing about sex.

It has a cock, a heart, two fists. (They pump).

2

On a chair in the living room of an apartment filled with poets, a young
poet reads his poems aloud. T., his girlfriend/partner/other (significant),
sits beside him. He reads (I paraphrase), "Or maybe I should just fuck T.
again instead."

An expression of hurt or violation by T's body or face will be read by the
audience as hurt or violation. Her body makes no expression.

The word "fuck" colors everything else that is read that evening.

I think, "I need to use 'fuck' in my poems more often."

3

There is real violence
But it as an after-dinner violence
Mellow in the air
As sex is a kind of violence

like anything
that pulls us toward it
even though we're unable
to ask for it by name.

? Elaine Equi, "Brand X"

In a forest in England, standing in a pit that's four feet deep ? wide
enough to hold eight 13-year-old boys and one 15-year-old girl ? one of the
boys and the girl are having a disagreement about the outcome of a game.
The boy shouts, "Shut up or I am going to rape you." She screams, "Bugger
off." An expression of hurt or violation by his body or face will be read
by the audience as weakness or cowardice. He grabs her by the shoulders and
drags her to the ground. The other boys hold her there, each using one hand
for pressure, the other for groping. Hands grab breasts, reach for crotch,
unsuccessfully try to slide beneath skin tight jeans. Then, suddenly, they
stop. None of them knows what it means to "rape" some one. None of them
knows how to use his cock (or her cunt, for that matter). Covered with
tears and dirt, the girl runs off, shouting behind her. "My boyfriend's got
a knife. He's going to kill all of you."

In college, I write a story about this. I want to purge myself of the guilt
I feel at having remembered taking part in it. I have never written a story
before. I publish it in the college literary journal. One night, a woman
I've never met knocks at my door. She wants to know why I wrote this story.
Because it happened, I say. She cries a little, then hands me five pages of
green-lined traction paper printed out off the VAX system in the computing
center. Her story begins after the rape, when the girl begins to suffer
from shyness, anxiety, bulimia.  We date for a while, but we never have
sex. She later moves to South Africa, marries a member of the ANC.

Another woman, an acquaintance, uses my story in her English class at an
all girls' Catholic high school in Manhattan. Many of the girls in the
class admit to having been physically violated at some point in their
lives. She calls to tell me how happy she is that my story helped her girls
open up.  She asks, Why did you write it? Because it happened, I say. Were
you there? Yes, I say. Were you the boy who said it? No. I just followed, I
say.

I have sex in my dorm room with a woman who is very drunk. She wakes up and
leaves without a word and we don't see each until graduation day, at a
party. She begins shouting at me and hitting me, screaming over and over:
"We have to settle, we have to settle." Someone pulls her off me and takes
her home. I leave the party soon after that, not knowing what she meant. A
couple years later, my best friend, a woman who is also her best friend,
tells me that the woman has since been telling all her friends that I raped
her. I ask why she hasn't told me about this. I didn't want to get in the
middle, she says. If you thought it was a lie, you would have told me. I
know, she says, but that story you wrote in college.

5

I wonder if I were to brag about sex what I would brag about. "I have been
fucked by so many women." The phrasing would need to change, of course.

I wonder who "the vulnerable, the fractured, the disenfranchised, the
sexually fucked-up" really are. I picture a diseased body with a broken
leg, quivering, crying out in pain. His cries are sexual.

I wonder why my body often feels symbolic. Like its meaning has been
written by someone else. It must be real, it leads me to do terrible things.

I wonder what happens to "My cunt is a camera" if I change it to: "My cock
is a camera standing before a waterfall cascading down a mountain lit by a
street lamp. It's looking at you looking at it thinking to yourself I am
looking at Mike's cock and it is looking at me"?

I wonder about "transgression" as a value.

I wonder ? if I offend, does it follow that what I have said is
"offensive"? Or is it just me?

6

Whatever sex is it is because of the meaning I give it. I am having sex
with my lover. I cannot come. Her body doesn't turn me on tonight. Dirty
words issuing from her lips don't sound dirty. I fantasize about fucking a
prostitute in the front seat of my car. This really gets me off. I come,
fast. Who am I fucking? I write: "Whatever sex is it is because of the
meaning I give it." I am having sex with my lover. I cannot come. Her body
doesn't turn me on tonight. Dirty words issuing from her lips don't sound
dirty. I fantasize about fucking a prostitute in the front seat of my car.
This really gets me off. I come, fast. Who am I fucking? I write: "Whatever

why doesn't rubbing my arm feel as good.  I should stop but I can't. NOW.
to speak it constantly & exploit it as a secret. (F)

wear these gloves to bed and keep your hands above your head. systems of

in 5th grade I get into trouble for showing my bush to the neighborhood

girls express disgust (pig squeals).  his hair dark, greasy. the working
classes have dibs on sex.   I go on the floor with him.  my first hard-on
pussying up against me. it floats.

JD, after other methods fail, eats his victims in order to be closer to
them.  first he tries to keep them in an anaesthetized state: available but
not much trouble. the WRIThING flesh decays and imposes its own dis-order,

I still experience the meta (as she's a woman) of the lyrical polite . it

..and sew on a stitch, into-and-over the wound, Duchamp's peephole perhaps
the gaze-wound of male desire, voyeuristic fear and longing, wanting both
closure (of the hole, the fear of castration) and control (mastery of the
gaze, the female body contained and objectified). Or: throw on the switch,
plug into the mediating machine, the flesh-object writes back, becomes
subject, suspect, the gaze cut-up and fed back into vibrating loops of
uncontainable desire.

"A kiss on each drain, I use a knife to dismember your nose, and hold it up
against your face. Bone-and then you placed them in plastic bags, our
tongues. Absolutely. According to my state, about a month later my panties
were soaked. All these parts coalescing into a heart, we had sex and used
sleeping pills, rose, and your cock is in the center fucking, strangled me
and then dismembered my body for the first time..."

Dodie's recent work "Cunt-ups", sections 1-4 of which are featured in a
recent issue of The San Jose Manual of Style, is an even more extreme
expression of "sexual writing" than Broken English (Meow Press) her
collaboration with Bob Harrison. Whereas the latter text, even after having
been processed by the machine and aligned into an alphabetized encyclopedia
of desire, still contains an implicit exchange (of come-ons, fluids, raw
matter, etc.) between more than one gendered subject (though heavily
mediated), "Cunt-ups" is a further explosion of textual sexuality that
resists principles of formal ordering, is polyvalent in its voice and
range, and as perverse in its sentence construction as its content. Its
"setting" is the mediated exchange itself, the fractured articulation of "a
female body who has sex writing about sex." While the title might imply a
gendered site of production, it also suggests a sexual/textual violence
that is more than a mere "disorganization of the senses" but a
dismemberment of the gendered body as well. The text becomes a (feminist)
desiring machine, its writing a prosthetic device mediating the traces of
physicality, imagination, abjection, and pleasure.

"And then your blood will be in my cock on your cunt, your nipples,
dragging through my totally cliched heart, opening like a big silly, and
yes my heart, your balls slapping against me and you would be sucking and
meaning. All this says small, or in between. You are very easy with words,
but life is different."

The "cunt-ups" resist the scopophilic gaze of the masculine reader/voyeur,
although "participation" is not entirely refused: one can "play", but only
on the terms of the implied author-dentata. Or, perhaps more accurately, a
cinema-dentata, which dismembers the camera obscura of Duchamp's peephole
and produces a camera lucida, a writing machine shooting out images onto
the page. The cunt-ups are less a stitching-together of variant expressions
of sexuality as much as a ripping-out-by-the-teeth of the
never-quite-healed stitches of normative sexuality. The writing-machine
(the organ-without-bodies) is a prosthetic device for the flesh-machine,
translating arousal into a language that cannot be organized into the
"non-criminal" without overturning the logic of "criminal" itself.

A Foucauldian might suggest that arousal per se is not criminal, unless
such arousal cannot be contained by normative sexual values. Arousal
directed away from heterosexual norms and/or the eroticized realm of
commodity fetishism becomes a threat to both patriarchal norms as well as
the values of capitalist consumption. It is not so much a question of
refusal but of possible redirection and resistance.

The film "A Question of Silence" ends with the outbreak of feminist
laughter that cannot be contained by the masculinist discourse of
patriarchal society. Violence against the male-dominated regime cannot be
explained in the regime's own language without undermining the very regime
itself. Sexual deviance, always mediated but always embodied, is the
laughter of flesh-machines jacked-in to prosthetics that can never fully
stitch closed the cultural and material wounds of disenfranchised bodies.
The filmstock threads itself through the machine's cinema-dentata. Every
camera is a two-way mirror; every mediation a politicized exchange. The
virus-code of deviance is the cyborg's flesh-machine pleasuring itself with
explosions of uncontainable laughter.

Body / Writing / Money
by Susan Wheeler

          Before me a text.  As in working from any text, what gets to me
is the sense of moving into it, moving into Dodie - or rather, her
clothing, the cat pee odor on my nightgown, the black pantsuit in the linen
sea, the chic new clothes,  all this not intended as violation but
violation nonetheless.  What I then think is  my breasts don't even measure
up to breasts.

          The part where I fit the clothing best - her shoulder, maybe, or
is it hip - is when the fellow quotes the Blanchot, the poet exposing
himself to the violence of pure being, and her "'Yes,' I say, 'but how do
you then go to work?'" It is that curbing of the body for survival
economically.  For is it not the social wherewithal to blend at any
function that brings on the bacon.

          For thirteen months my prayer had been, "Thy will you piece of
shit be done," but/thus I still came home to eviction notices.  Job
interviews plenty (my seams contained on paper, my excretions not hitting
the page), my interviewing clothes thinning, fraying.  After a long hiatus,
I had gotten a call-back for a second interview with a woman as prelude to
a third with a higher-up.  The woman registered me with shock when I
showed. "When you come for the next," she said, confidingly, "you need to
wear some make-up."

          The scrim of oil on the skin.  The bleeding that starts
willy-nilly, at any time of month, the inappropriate office attire.
Signaling health, class, mother's care.  Evaluative markers - a gate and
now tracing the path to a paycheck.  The risk in drooling, bleeding
through, smelling, dirt. The unemployable.  Both Brooks Brothers and Armani
women's clothes cut the chests large, the hips narrow: bred into a class, a
shape.

          The leaves are down.  The woman next door has just crawled onto
the roof of the first floor and is now reaching into the gutters of the
second.  She wears yellow rubber gloves.  A canoe passes on the Hudson.
It's raw and gray and I imagine the exhaustion in the muscles of the
canoeist.

          As my days worsened, I came home to the reek of Willy's pee on
the bed, the only soft surface in the studio, every night, we fighting over
territory, tension, attention, food.   I had started to make the rent by
contracting the studio as a bed-and-breakfast and moving out along with
Willy and his cat box whenever there was a taker.  Willy's piss lost me
takers, lost me rent, the reek of it.

          Among my six undergraduate students this week, one writes a long
prose piece about reaming "a booger" and another's goes from one piss to
another piss, a poem dense with urinals and sex.  There is the ghost of
class, money -  as there is the not ghost at all but declaimer of money in
A.M. Holmes' fiction, this what domesticates her work - but nonetheless the
piss poem is obsessive, it rattles the others in the class struggling to be
tolerant Ivy Leaguers.   I mimic the class, the class.

          To be the skin sliding into another's.  The first French I
learned was about washing dirty laundry, something about salle and
vetements that leaves me now.

          The canoe is gone.  A sports utility vehicle drives by slowly and
a woman in the passenger's seat looks up at me in the window, my standing
body, its disconnected fingers at this screen that with a Windows nature
scene barks at me when I err, the reminder of pure fear in the beetle that
ticks off waiting-time with the software, me afraid to touch the perforated
stickers of spiders I had for pasting in the nature booklets we had when I
was six. The booby trap the body was in the illnesses it brought.  The
bleeding. Not hard to write off for a paycheck.

          So after considering the first two responses a long time, I've
come to the conclusion that these two ladies are all in a huff about
nothing, bless their emotional little hearts. Their complaints come out of
a failure to exploit the market potentials of their own position.
Self-aware marketers never suffer from the pain and rage expressed by Ms.
Bellamy and Ms. Wheeler, who don't yet understand how to make the most out
of what they've got. At the risk of giving away trade secrets, I'd like to
offer my own analysis of how they might more fully understand their
particular market potentials.

          In a free market system of the kind that thankfully we have,
pain, rage and doubt are not necessary, and easy to do away with if one can
think clearly. They are, in fact, nothing more than insufficiently
understood marketing. The person who has learned to sell him or herself
properly and completely has no space left over for unproductive pain and
rage. While I can't outline a complete business philosophy in this short
response, I can at least outline several key marketing principles that will
help Ms. Bellamy and Wheeler overcome their unproductive feelings and be
happy, American, and rich. Anyone following these principles can develop
their own fabulous Moneybody to its full earning potential.

          Principle #1: Learn to sell each body part separately, so that
each can become as productive as possible.

          If I think of myself as a single individual, then it's hardly
surprising that I would have only myself to sell, and that, as myself, I
would be only able to perform a single task at a time. But think of how
many more goods an individual has to sell if that individual sells each
body part individually. And think of how many more tasks one could complete
if each body part, given a chance to develop its powers fully, was allowed
to function according to its separate talents.

          I remember very well the afternoon when I realized how many tasks
my different body parts could perform simultaneously, or at least within a
short period of time. With my left hand, on my new palm held computer I was
busy squeezing the last drop of profit out of my South American factories
by a quick calculation of how much harm I was doing to myself by actually
paying wages, and noted how much more I could make if I only promised wages
and then fired workers after two weeks, right before their first pay
period. Meanwhile my mouth, in an effective temporary group project with my
right hand, was busy dismissing a secretary; the woman wore no make-up and
wouldn't flirt with the guys in the office, and we all know what that
means, so I couldn't have her around. Of course, they've got their markets
too; tolerance is a byword with the self-aware marketer, who's always in
search of new markets to penetrate. My stomach, meanwhile, was busy
digesting a supposedly five-star meal from a restaurant I was considering
purchasing; far from being a negative sign, my vague discomfort told me
that the food there was not as fine as advertised, a sure sign that the
restaurant would have a sufficiently high profit margin to be purchasable.
I was doing all these things just a moment before my legs received part of
their daily physical workout by running to the john, where other parts...
pardon my not using the words, I don't like to be obscene... helped me to
take a long, healthy, proud American piss, freeing me of unnecessary
burdens like a good downsizing, and not at all like the wasteful protest
piss that Ms. Bellamy describes, or the furtive ashamed urination taken by
Ms. Wheeler's student, who's afraid to directly assert his consumer
desires. I was aware the whole time of how much more my body could be doing
than it even was. If all these parts could perform these separate tasks
with such efficiency, then how much more money could I make by contracting
my various body parts out on various occasions to other businesses that had
need of my formidable skills?

          Principle #2: Negative images of ourselves or others are nothing
more than markets that have yet to be penetrated.

          For the unaware marketer, Ms. Bellamy's and Ms. Wheeler's
obsession with urine may seem on their part expressions of anger or
loathing that can only get in the way of their making a proper presentation
of themselves, a sad commentary on the waste caused by the maladjusted. But
the aware marketer sees that this particular obsession might be amenable to
a whole range of products. Granted, the urine obsession market is probably
a niche market rather than a mainstream one; still, there must be a
significant population that shares this obsession. Thus, while Ms. Bellamy
and Ms. Wheeler use urine as a marker of what is unacceptable as a mode of
body and social presentation, the aware marketer recognizes that
individuals who feel unacceptable because of their desire for urine could
transform into a whole product line what only seems like an unhealthy
preoccupation. One can imagine, for instance, a cat piss perfume for those
who like to be pissed on by cats but have no cats currently at hand;
indeed, if cat piss is what someone was after, why bother with the whole
cat at all? You need only purchase the part of the cat that you want to
purchase. Thus this second principle can be seen to be a direct extension
of the first.

          Principle #3: The differences of each person's body parts are
precisely what make each body part a unique product.

          All hands are not the same any more than all beers are the same.
If all hands and beers were the same, we'd have no need of marketers.
Marketers are exactly in the business of marketing differences. What kind
of hand would you like to touch you? What kind of arm would you like
attached to that hand? Which particular types of body measurements, male or
female, are most powerfully arousing to you? Do you have particular
preferences for certain sizes, shapes, skin colors, emotional or cultural
histories? Do you prefer your bodies scarred? The aware marketer of
separate body parts can custom design exactly the kind of body that will
lead you to new peaks of orgasm; indeed, it's now possible even to custom
design your orgasm itself.

          Principle #4: Beliefs about differences between male and female
bodies create the different markets in which each group can be sold.

          Of course, by now, it should be clear that the notion that male
and female bodies exist is nothing more than an inadequate marketing
concept; once we break down bodies into individual parts, nothing at all
prevents us from mixing and matching parts to create all sorts of new
sellable sexes. Nonetheless it remains true that many dominant markets
still insist on a definite natural distinction between men and women, and
as long as they do so, there's a tremendous amount of money to be made.
Given the existing marketplace, the various ways in which men and women can
sell their bodies remains different and definable, but these differences
should be thought of as chances to sell more products, not as reasons for
complaint. The number of ways in which men and women can sell their bodies
is far too large to document here, but several key points might profitably
be made. In mainstream markets it may be easier for women to sell their
bodies in certain types of ways, as objects of sexual pleasure for
instance; the woman who does this will be happy, according to the laws of
the marketplace, when she gets as large a wage as possible for these
services. Similarly, in mainstream markets men are currently more able to
sell their bodies as violent projectiles intended to cause physical harm;
again, according to the laws of the marketplace, they should sell to the
highest bidder this talent for inflicting pain. Men and women whose bodies
or desires do not conform to the mainstream marketplace need not despair;
the niche markets for differing activities can certainly lead to
significant wealth as long as one develops a self-aware marketing plan.

          Principle #5: Happiness comes from selling yourself completely.

          Any body part that languishes in unproductive pain is of no use
either to the current owner of that body part or to other potential owners.
An unused body part is no more than ignored profit potential. If each body
part is actively involved in an adequate marketing plan, no part of the
body need suffer unnecessary discomfort. It's important to make the most of
yourself, and you can do so if you get committed to always selling every
part of yourself that you can. Ms. Bellamy and Ms. Wheeler should stop
yelling, and start selling. Remember, the key to your perfect Moneybody is
not to let anybody else sell you short, unless, of course, short is what
you're selling.

        I had no time to hate -
        Because
        The grave would hinder me -
        And Life was not so
        Ample I
        Could finish - Enmity -

        Nor had I time to Love -
        But since
        Some Industry must be-
        The little toil of Love -
        I thought
        Be Large enough for me -

                     Emily Dickinson


 Sex is how we're all connected and the same as each other one big
primordial sea and electric lightning impulse from heaven that charged the
sea with life is love that lights our eyes to wink at each other. Writing
is letters that collapse time for conversation between bodies that have
this material form and movement like me now breathing and changing at my
desk and the spirited disembodied dead hovering around the foreseen souls
wandering to and fro on the page-love letter, Dear One,. A sea of voices
waving at each other in an inverse of chronological time turned out on
itself moving and singing a round inwardly. Outside the snow falls and
black ravens circling above trees out my window mean something.

I took a biology class long ago. We watched a film made in the late sixties
about the primordial sea and the lightning that sparked life. I was in love
and writing love letters secretly in my journal during class. The professor
told us about the "Prokaryote Cannibal Host" theory of of sexual evolution:
that in the Primordial Sea single cells swallowed other single cells and
that is the first sex.

Two days ago Tom and I flew back from Oregon to Buffalo and in the airport
I read about Kip Kingle who at age fifteen killed both his parents and then
shot twenty-four classmates killing three. He was super in love with some
girl in his class and they watched the newest movie version of *Romeo and
Juliet* together. When the police arrived at his house the soundtrack from
the movie's death scene - an opera piece - was blaring from inside and his
parents were dead covered with white sheets. Before his rampage he wrote in
his journal about love being a bad thing because love leads to hate.
(Shakespeare keeps humming lines to actors out in the graveyard.) He said
he killed his parents because he had to, because he loved them.

I remember vividly a super erotic image I had when I was about six years
old: diving off the high diving board at the Navy base swimming pool onto a
knife being held by a Sailor treading water below me. And the knife goes
into my vagina and blood floods everywhere in the water. How did I come up
with that? I can tell you that I didn't get that image from anything
explicit I'd seen or heard. I even didn't know what a period was, or a
penis, or the penis in the vagina scenario. Where did that scenario come
from and why did it turn me on so intensely at six?

I love the world and water and trees and people and animals. I masturbated
yesterday and as I came I was swimming in the warm clear beautiful tropical
water with dolphins singing and swimming nearby. I thought after I came how
much I now associate *pleasure* with the erotic (go figure) and that it was
not always this way. How violent and rape oriented my primordial-young
erotic fantasy life was. Also I wondered if it was bestiality of some sort
- this love connection I felt in orgasm to sea beasts and sun and water.

I think of Dodie's physical body sitting across me. Of friendship. Of
TELLING stories. I remember Dodie and Kevin staying with me here in Buffalo
years ago and miss them. Dodie and I ate breakfast and drank coffee in the
kitchen. Deep in a time when I couldn't remember love or friends like a
whispering voice down a hall behind a rust belt brick city wall Dodie and
Kevin came and I remembered. The sound of feet. Chinese medicine pellets
and extra toothbrushes. Empty Diet Pepsi cans in the recycling box.

The deep winter freeze, the lay-out of a city. The prison architecture of
University at Buffalo - so cruel it is criminal. Factors I compute inside
the deeply isolating experience of being here in Buffalo, New York. A City,
a life (grad student) that prohibits intimacy. In one Autumn walking
through a Buffalo graveyard with the leaves all aflame I knew I had chosen
to be a writer. All red yellow and orange having just died. Paradoxically
Buffalo is where I fell in real love .like bursting dirty toenails sweet
smell wild. impassioned. These days, my last here, I think of Luis Bunuel
and his films. He wrote that the erotic was for him somehow connected to
dead bodies.

Lusty . and we want to be here . period. each breath .

Maybe we write so as to have friends in the Land of the Dead. White gauze
paper wrap. Recently I visited an old friend in a city far away and we saw
the new Omnimax film about the Pyramids together. She was a month away from
her trip to Egypt. That day it rained really hard but the bright green of
an inner city rain forest brightened my eye. Now she is wandering in hot
sun and sand and I'm sitting at a desk in the snowy cold writing about it.
The secret is in three dimensions out my window ravens circle and it means
something because she told me in Alaska black birds circling above the
trees meant something and so to me it was revealed that night in the Chapel
the ice cold of a longing for two dimensions in this world. Oh dear. I gave
her H.D.'s *Helen in Egypt* for her January 20th Birthday before she left
for Egypt.

I copied this out and tucked it in the book:

how can you find the answer
in the oracles of Greece
or the hieroglyphs of Egypt?

you may work or steal your way
into the innermost shrine
and the secret escape you;

some say a bowman from the Walls
let fly the dart, some say it was Apollo,
but I, Helena, know it was Love's arrow

An Economy of Bodies/Writing/Gender
by Matthias Regan

I.
The first word in Dodie's title is "Body"; the last word of her piece is
"typing." These words have at least two things in common. First, both
signify bodies: "Body" provides the abstract, the place-holder, which a
body is, and typing describes a process requiring a body. One form of the
physical labor of writing, typing requires a direct and articulate contact
between machine and body. When the body comes into contact with machines we
call the labor proletarian and think of it as more primitive, sometimes
more enjoyable, more "earthy" than other kinds of work. "Primitive,"
"enjoyable," "'earthy'": three words to describe a presently accepted
intellectual construct of what bodies are. What gets produced when typing
produces writing we call intellectual. "Abstract," "etherial," "fantastic,"
perhaps. The other thing these two words have in common, after all, is that
they are both words. This is unavoidable, even when the words signify
"body."

Dodie is well aware of these complexities. The body is almost the only
thing left these days easily played off against language. "I'm working
towards a writing," she tells us, and sends us to a writing class to think
about bodies. "Writing that shifts the matrix," she tells us. Hinting
Sartre, we could say all writing either shifts or confirms "the matrix,"
which I read as "world view" or "hegemony." Three propositions Dodie's
piece provokes: "writing about the body shifts the world view"; "a body,
like writing, shifts the world view"; "a body, writing, shifts the world
view." A matrix of possible meanings, a constellation (many of which are
bodies). "Writing that shifts the matrix," she tells us; I think that's
possible.

Impossible, however, when confined to "sex."  "No sex without gender" means
you can't conceptualize a sex without imagining a gender. The distinction
between "gender" and "sex" roughly corresponds to that between
"superstructure" and "base" in post-Marxist theory. Once it was believed
that everything could be traced back to the base, pure and simple. The base
was unimpeachable, a solidarity, just as the sexed body once was. Now we
understand that the superstructure is hardly derivative--it is precisely
what allows us to conceptualize the economy (which, after all, begins with
bodies-in-time), even though engendered by it. This is also true of sex,
except the gender categories that determine are less products of sex than
of ideology. Ideological categories encode power relations, but not
necessarily. When they do, they determine the sex and control the body--but
never, perhaps, to the nth degree (save in fantasy). This is a hopeful
figuration; I hope it's possible.

If no fantasy is entirely determined by ideology, but if the body almost
always is, when is fantasy a way out? When the matrix's shifted, which,
because fantasy's categories are involved, means no sex without a gender.

II.
Just about the only thing I can image myself doing in which my body is
totally out of the picture is fantasizing. Nonetheless, the fantasies in
both D's and Susan Wheeler's narratives are about the body. I was doing it
just now, in fact, when I was trying to imagine myself doing things that
didn't involve the body. (It seems there's no escaping it.) The textual
body Wheeler terms "I" reaches out to the body D. names "A female body who
has sex." Their cats and workshops seem similar, although this is conveyed
in one and many words, respectively. Each word might be thought of as a
piece of the body; D's body assembled, in her own words, through "my cunt,"
"my head," "my hair." Is the phrase "I miss him" three words about the
body? Are some fantasies--say porno, horror flicks and avant-garde
writing--more about the body than others? Is the body in loose-fitting
clothes, or in a car, a body? Wheeler's last paragraph suggests an end to
the fantasy; the female passenger of the SUV takes us away from the
computer screen, perhaps moments before the words are encoded into
electricity and flashed through wires, the actual connection.

III.
The first time I was sure Mark Wallace's work was parodic was the 2nd
paragraph: "In a free market . . . Of the kind that thankfully we have."
Two tip-offs here: the intellectual bodies that respond to internet poetics
lists hosted by the sort of ideological apparatus a state university is
rarely express gratitude for the free market. Being a government
institution, SUNY participates in the free market somewhat negatively, "a
sore thumb." The other clue was antiquated syntax: "that thankfully we
have" sounds vaguely English Lit.; I think of Swift, and everybody is
thinking of Swift when they write satire. (Or, for that matter, when they
contemplate the delicate horrors of ladies shitting.) It's hard to imagine
one could have History without first having bodies, but a commonplace that
one can (and often should) have a history without bodies. This is because:
a) abstraction burns through ideology like sun though smog, and b) the
bodies in history have long since reduced to dust, or ash.

When, earlier, Wallace writes "I've come to the conclusion that these two
ladies are all in a huff" I guessed it might be satire but wasn't sure:
this is why we mustn't let gender piss us off.

The "desire for urine" Mr. Wallace expresses is, apparently, entirely his
own.

IV.
Bodies in this narrative come paired with desire, the marketplace,
friendship, love. Fantasy, remembrance, perhaps, are the modems the body
uses to connect up to these things. Melville's word, "Queequeg" comes to
mind--a friendly body covered in foreign writing. "Inscribed," as in
"conscripted" or "encrypted." A body brought by the free-market into
contact with the narrator's body; they sleep together and then its hundreds
of pages before we get the close-up of Q's body covered in unreadable
words--perhaps that's how long it took for his script to grow foreign again.

One may extrapolate from Alicia Cohen's seventh paragraph the idea that
"prison architecture . . . prohibits intimacy." During the ellipsis we get
this news about a body: it walks through a graveyard in Buffalo in the
fall. One might have said: the information we get about the body is: it
walks; but what is a body without scenery? Taken out of context and, in all
its glory, it amounts to little (hence we mourn our dead). Fortunately,
thanks to context, all sorts of bodies exist. This may, of course, be
unfortunate as well. How does desire expressed by the non-intimate
body-in-prison differ from desire expressed by the non-private
body-in-a-writing-class? If we were conversing and you said, "no
difference," I'd reply: "Yeah? Well what happens to institutions, then?
Just where are they supposed to go?"

If so, why are desire and the market hot topics today? The answer, again,
is gender.

V.
The body is an archive, the body is a rope, the body likes a toothbrush,
the body turned to soap: erase the context and all you get are words. My
body tells me this, typing.

Lip Sync
by Ron Silliman

Possibly sex is always ahistorical, or at the least outside of history,
because its always *my body*. Strands from the thread of sex as an
institution over the past sixty years: implicit though largely unspoken
within the creation of a "youth subculture" that was always at its heart a
"market" (the perceived lewdness of Elvis, Chubby Checker, *Louie Louie*);
explicit in the frothing out of control of that same market into a vaguely
directed counterculture (from "Love-ins" and the poetry of Lenore Kandel to
the airplane rape in Robert Frank's documentary of the Stones, *Cocksucker
Blues*, to the Sutro Baths hetero sex scene and polyandry in all its
guises); deeply problematized everywhere in the fact and discourse of AIDS;
explicit again in every high school poli sci course discussing the
impeachment of a President; the world wide web offers not only cybersex but
also every fetish, legal and otherwise, in every wired home on the planet.
You don't have to leave Rock Springs to get French postcards anymore.
Today, what is most outrageous about *Behind the Green Door* are the
preposterous 70s hairdos.

"The body is an archive" is exactly right. Herpes is the gift that keeps on
giving. Contraceptive technology can leave scar tissue where you least
expect/want it. We find one cohort of people pushing 40 suddenly very
concerned over the ability to get pregnant, another already welcoming
grandchildren.

Take a step back, disentangle yourself from the fleshy nets of being. There
have been (are) two great currents at work. The stronger has been
constantly toward greater self-determination and choice, increased openness
(most of my grandmother's sisters had abortions well before WWI). The
second, a literal backlash, has in our lives been articulated through a
discourse of contagion. Whereas what might have been the free play between
libidinal impulse (that utopian moment in the gay community expressed
as/thru anonymous sex) and the equally powerful urges for intimacy &
community - & the enormous toll of acknowledging/accommodating both - never
gets to be developed, what remains is, in the broadest terms, our life
(lives). How many of my cohorts actually hear the word "gentle" in
"gentleman"?

It is within this ensemble of the already given that each one of us must
act (daily, even moment by moment) always positioned. Our age, our history,
bodies, all the social stigmata each one of us carries about is perpetually
being recalibrated by every person in our field (and by none more anxiously
than ourselves). Confronting death - & what else do you stare at, naked in
front of your mirror? - sex was a promise of release by other means. So why
is Nixon waving forever in front of that grainy helicopter?

Untitled Response
by Brian Stefans

I'm wasn't really sure how to respond to your post, Rachel, except perhaps
to recycle some arguments from Sianne Ngai's "Poetics of Disgust" essay,
which I don't have on hand.  It seems, nonetheless, to have something to =
do
with the "good doo doo" (a quote from a Deanna Ferguson poem) aspect of =
the
"abject" corner of Language writing, and I guess is forcing a =
consideration
of the ugliness of its clashing syllables versus the relative clarity of
the references to thinkers such as Kristeva (whom I've never really read)
and Freud.  And to suggest, elsewhere, that the "dream" permits a sort of
never coming to "terms" with gender, which I suppose is a position I am
attracted to (I tend to call it enforced adolescence, hence putting it in =
a
social scale) though would not quite know how to declare.  McCaffery on
semantic slippage in bpNichol's wordplay also comes to mind, but I'm not
sure whether I should interpret the text or respond to it on its terms (a
little of both, it seems).  However, now that my stream-of-nothingness is
running full speed, here is a direct connect:

I was reading Paul Goodman's Growing Up Absurd this morning on the subway,
a book which is kind of boring to read all the way through, and when it's
least boring it seems rather wrong, but nonetheless interesting as an
attempted dialogue with a generation much younger than him, the Beats in
the case of the chapter I find interesting.  He writes, concerning the
sexuality of the Beats:

"So perhaps another reason for their dropping the old physical jazz and
revival is just the opposite, that the display of energy would upset their
coolness, it would be embarrassing to make them feel too young.  I wonder
if this is not the simple explanation of their disdain of social dancing =
as
"dry" sex; for certainly one of the reasonable uses of social dancing is
body contact and sometimes sexual foreplay.  But these boys are =
embarrassed
to get an erection, to betray feeling, in public, though they are more =
than
willing to take their clothes off and exhibit themselves, or to beat a =
drum
wildly in public as an exhibition for the others, but not as contact with
them." (182)

This addresses one paradox, as the purported "freedom" associated with
running around naked that is held up against society's repression actually
comes up cold in those moments within society in which "sexual foreplay"
can be enacted in public.  I remember reading in Habermas about the =
sixties
political youth movements that there was a certain narcissism present in
much of this activity that would limit the actions to displays, but that
there was no chance for them to take the majority role once anything was
achieved as their self-image would be disrupted.  I think of this a fair
amount (poets should dress like bankers, Auden once wrote), as I wonder =
how
many are willing to make this flip from performative disdain to =
responsible
member of a community should that community gain political weight, or
whether anyone cares about this.  Elsewhere Goodman writes of these male
Beat poets have a "healthy sexuality" in fact, but he sees the role that
women played in the community as primarily maternal, with the young men
bursting into tears the moment someone like Kenneth Patchen says their
poetry's childish, and the woman poet stepping in to coo reassurances in
their ear.  This seems a little opposite of what we generally take to be
the story of the Beat era, whose best poets were gay and whose women poets
were often radical individualists (is that a word?) but had been excluded
from the male-centered self-canons.  But Goodman makes it clear that =
"Beat"
and "artist" were not synonymous (he argues many points regarding this),
hence, though there were hundreds of people keeping notebooks and drawing
pictures and calling themselves "artists", few had a framework for viewing
the world in terms of social relations due to the pure excitment of the
Beat community itself as experience.  (This brings to mind something
tangential: we all bitch and moan about how the "community" is not fer =
real
today, it's just some pose, but actually, were the community to be as
exciting and self-concerned as the Beats, we might have worse poets - who
knows.)

Anyway, to bring this back to Dodie's essay, there seems to be a paradox
present in that she writes she is "working towards a writing that subverts
sexual bragging, a writing that champions the vulnerable, the fractured,
the disenfranchised, the sexually fucked-up," and at the same time would
not want one with "x-ray vision" to see the "frayed elastic on my =
panties."
Her essay itself, which argues for the person for whom "EAT SHIT" could be
an erotic suggestion, seems to set up a forceful argument along the lines
of "you must take all of this in to 'qualify' as a radical" via a very
performative language - she don't mince words - and yet at the same time
looks at the "vulnerable," and where radical sexuality crosses with social
pose in the many anecdotes later on.  So the abstraction of the "body", =
she
argues, should be brought to some specific materiality probably through
anecdote (as she is a prose writer), but on the other she as the reader
becomes vulnerable once this body appears in the writing - hence the
challenge, the need for form in presenting oneself. Both pure abstraction =
-
leaping from critical term to critical term - and pure exhibitionism - as
I've heard at several New York poetry readings and probably not for the
last time: "here is a poem about my CLITORIS" (hahaha goes the audience) -
fail because they don't engage with the struggle with form.

Well, I'm not asking everyone, i.e. these writers of the latter group, to
mature; as I wrote above, I think the pre-adolescent mode of writing is
perfectly legit (Rimbaud haunts this discussion, I feel, his sonnets about
seeing the erect dicks of bulls at the county fair, for instance, combined
with his Catholicism).  However, it seems that part of the challenge is
using this erotic tendency to "do good" in a way.  I think some writers =
are
doing this now, or are beginning to: a book I've received recently, by a
guy named Garrett Caples, takes on the lack of eroticism in what he
considers the "Victorian" underpinings of the Language poets is a case in
point.  So here is a younger poet using performatively "vulgar" language
(the poem is called "Humped by Barrett Watten") to somehow address larger
social issues, while trying to avoid what he would probably consider the
castration of abstract terminology and the social control of theoretical
models.  I'm sure some people consider him inarticulate, mean, or
completely untalented to do this in the way he does, but I think he's
interesting precisely because his pose (or reality, who knows when he =
wrote
these) is of an adolescent refusing to give up the directness of his
pre-discursive, poly-sexual experience while keeping his eyes on the
future, which is that of social scales of meaning, and potential
conformity.  (Some of the poems are really very good, a sure improvement =
on
the "Beats", though tied to a nostalgic surrealism.)  To quote Dodie on
Samuel Delaney: "*Hogg* constantly compels the reader to choose one
filth-laden situation *over* another, when most of us would simply want to
be rid of the entire set of experiences."  In language, this "set of
experiences" would be words that are deemed counter-discursive, words of
"disgust," the Calibanic perhaps, but also the discursive content when it
is deemed offensive to sexual mores.  So, Hogg forces us to conceive of a
hierarchy of values, a structure, where once was a shit-mound of
unassimilable experience; once this structure is conceived, what's to stop
one from attaching it to the larger ethical structures we associate with
democracy?

I feel like I could go on with this - wanted to mention the new law =
against
distributing "crush" videos, which I've read about in the Voice (I don't
think cute animals should die for anyone's sexual pleasure myself) - but
this is probably too long.

Attached to this email, however, is a little poem that uses the words of
Rachel's text.  I ran some computer processes on it; actually, all I did
was alphabetize the words in it and then construct shorter poems from =
them.
However, various faults in the method left a cluster of non-alphabetized
words at the top, and words that appear after m-dashes and slashes are not
alphabetized.  These processes usually display the formless subconsious of
certain texts, but it's hard to imagine a subconscious to Rachel's text -
it's so "exposed" - so this actually provides a superego for it.  Change =
or
add to it what you will.

Ok, gotta run.

PACKRAT
by Jonathan Skinner

The paradox Dodie grapples with in her effort to "subvert sexual bragging,"
as Brian points out, is that "sexual bragging" is required of "the
vulnerable, the fractured, the disenfranchised, the sexually fucked-up."
Those who fall outside these categories (though I'm not sure what D. means
by "sexually fucked-up," as hardly any of us could claim not to be) perform
their sex "optionally," not "bragging" only because their performance is
normalized - as in the romantic pronouns of mainstream lyric poetry.
Everyone else sounds loud, or resorts to abstraction.

Don't know exactly where "my" body is in writing - but as a heterosexual,
white male I'm not supposed to, am I? Just enjoy the "option" of sex, of
marking my body, as I think I'll step in and get pierced, have a tatoo
here, BE somebody.

Dodie's writing reaches into and around, holds the body - making some kind
of direct connect, or glimpse through shifted matrix. Not that she - "a
female body who has sex" - seems to enjoy this stance: authors are listened
to, bodies get looked at (w/x-ray specs). In response writing brings the
abstraction of the "body" to "some specific materiality;" the challenge is
for writing to embody without ratifying the coarse objectifications, to
resist hegemony without simple counter hegemony. This, I take it, is what
Brian phrases "the challenge, the need for form in presenting oneself."

Depending on which direction you're coming from, a thickening blood
infusion or an injection of dialectical fluid, an architectonic colonic.

Dodie's forms - yes anecdote, along with letter, persona, autobiography (w/
the initials that authenticate more than they protect) - and, more vitally,
her cunt camera, a floating points cinemaxis eluding arrows of simple
narrative - form in what appears to be a resistance to form. As would her
prose's hovering unclassifiably on the (moving) borders of poetry.

I can't add to this conversation without packing in some environment. First
thing a country boy like me notices on coming to the city is sex - it's
"rampant." While cities are less socially "repressive," the body undergoes
another kind of repression - its contacts with soil, oxygen, flowing water,
chlorophyll, plant and animal life, open spaces, hi fi soundscapes, is
severely limited; if not aggravated by exposure to various levels of
toxicity. (Notice how the body quickens at an open air market?) Car based,
suburban "strip mall" life of most middle-sized towns is even worse. "Sex"
in this sense rides somewhere in the positive-negative feedback between
(relative) release from village confinement and asphalt's enclosure - a
surrogate wildness for a "concrete jungle."

As Vertov and Benjamin made clear, after the camera space would never be
the same for the masses. Once the preserve of the elite, all would now be
subject to the deforming (one-point perspectival) space of the gaze,
isolating bodies, making sex "nature:" Hollywood, the car and the VCR
generalize the sex-nature equation, country and city alike consolidated for
a "discourse of the body."

Even if it be a futile, largely imaginary endeavor, I find it important to
resist the totalizing panopticon of a discourse that would vouch for all
experience on the basis of sub/urban hegemony. I won't deny that's where
it's "happening" nor would I propose it desirable to "go back," but
instinct tells me to remember the differences, hoping for the day we learn
to live with, rather than under, our technologies.

Brian raised the spectre of Rimbaud - a poet who inhabits the space between
country and city in ways that remain, I believe, largely unexplored. His
relationship to the city was intense and ambivalent as it was short-lived.
The body in his work (eyeing the dicks of bulls at market) is far less
regulated than, say, Baudelaire's - who works with a heavily romanticized
(& Catholic) postcard nature: ports, vistas, memories from his
Mediterranean cruise. If the social upheavals (and repressions) of the
1870s are more relevant, to the "history" of Rimbaud's body, it's the
instability they occasion that sets him a-wandering, between city and
country - where registers, referents, dialects, sexual valencies fissure,
separate, slide across, over and into one another.

Although modernism attempts to claim Rimbaud, the break-up of personality
in his work may in fact suggest other directions: "persons" are such narrow
frames. Think about the multiplicity of a body: "metametazoan... a sort of
ornately elaborated mosaic of microbes in various states of symbiosis"
(Dorion Sagan). The ecology of a body, the choreography. Or lack thereof.

Once I was fortunate enough, probably too fortunate, to enter the monarch
butterfly sanctuary above Zitacuaro in the state of Michoacan, Mexico.
Found myself in what appeared to be a grove of dead pine trees. When a band
of sun came raying out all of the gray needles unfurled orange and black
wings, suddenly the air was filled with big heavy butterflies. They all
looked rather juicy. Then I heard them slapping together - they were
coupling.

Sometimes the impact was so forceful the couple (trio?) would fall flapping
thickly to the ground. The stickiness of it was in the air. Laying in the
warm sun (it was spring and quite cool up here in the hills) with eyes
closed I could feel the thousands of shadows spotting my lids. The wet thud
and click of fallen fucking insects all around me. A velvet whir. I undid
my fly - there was no image, no "fantasy" other than the imagination of
sticky butterfly organs, sexy wings - the heaviness and ripeness of the act.

The clinical strokes separating sex/body/writing seem to stand in for the
only process that could articulate a meaning here: feeling. Not that poetry
"expresses" feeling, but it finds, uncovers feeling latent in the
materials. It's about finding that groove in the work, the connectedness.
Sometimes you have to break apart to find this, I won't deny that. Doing it
now.

Body: any bounded aggregate of matter
fr. Germanic bot- (unattested), container
   American Heritage Dictionary

'cask, tub, vat'
   OED

Not the tidy container (body) of "creative writing"
poetic form is the pulse between being and not-being
it is the recurrence of this body
reasserting, reinscribing, reiterative, repeating

"Pollen condenses to mottled light on the ground. Assuming the sense of an
activity/ links to the frame of its experience, weakness in the framing
process makes our senses vulnerable . . . though nothing's unconnected in
the world,/ your memory of a person casting strands across unfixed wild
space sticky with pollen,/ and the moving frame of a child's hand inside
the chest cavity of an animal beside a barrel cactus/ crowned with magenta
flowers, how it stands in the world. The top is where growing crosses into
the real./ The child turns toward an imaginary animal."
   Berssenbrugge, "Pollen"

It's that incongruity, play or tension between framing and the senses,
between the real and the imaginary, between lines (of flight) and poem,
that's the body. Neither Rachel's poly-sexual and semantic, night-time
slippage (writing's not just words having sex), nor Dodie's polarized
daytime, x-ray abjection. I'm rooting for some in-between, some twilight
here. The body IS a catachresis, but one that knows it's some.


"Kleist invented a writing of this type, a broken chain of affects and
variable speeds, with accelerations and transformations, always in relation
with the outside. Open rings... designated by indefinite articles, or
rather by partitives (*some* couchgrass, *some* of a rhizome...)"
   Deleuze & Guattari, *A Thousand Plateaus*

don't know where gender fits

I'd agree its construction's
tied in with personhood,
with "having a face"

that the category "human"
can be no more nor less fundamental
(than gender, race, class, age

The human arises in the flesh of another

but shallower, and yellowed,

with tarnished tinfoil

They shifted a little, but not
to return my stare.
--It was more like the tipping
of an object toward the light."
   Bishop, "The Fish"

"The eyes of axolotls have no lids... So there was nothing strange in
what happened. My face was pressed against the glass of the aquarium,
my eyes were attempting once more to penetrate the mystery of those
eyes of gold without iris, without pupil. I saw from very close up
the face of an axolotl immobile next to the glass. No transition and
no surprise, I saw my face against the glass, I saw it on the outside
of the tank, I saw it on the other side of the glass. Then my face
drew back and I understood."
   Cortazar, "Axolotl"

As far as the "senses" and the "real" go, I mean them in this orientation,
as features of an outside: self ("my" body) as node in a chain of
material/energy exchanges - transformer, always already "outside."

"A liberation of sexuality not only from reproduction but also from
genitality..." (D & G)

Further, sensation outside the gaze

a body of bodies

outside as "wilderness"

where there are no individuals
out lost, swimming, wandering
pathless hearthless woods

every time you return it's different
every space you turn to is another

I needs to come out

numbered body diary/sex pistola
by Elizabeth Treadwell

"But, really, it is I who have invaded my own privacy." - Dodie Bellamy

"the pantheism of it/remembering a light on the trees" - Linda Russo

"It's each plastic, visionary hope chest" - Yedda Morrison

"Gender is a nightmare. To inhabit, to enact one gender, to embody one
gender all day and all night, everyday and every night is a nightmare." -
Jocelyn Saidenberg

"Wonder if any person really went anywhere, but here and there. We tried to
remember the stately stories of our houses, until that too became a
question which of us had gone really anywhere? And what were we?" - Mary
Butts

"Patriarchal poetry they do not do it right." - Gertrude Stein

"...a condition which rendered us generally incomprehensible to the public
at-large and placed us dangerously close to the possibility of being who we
were with only impossible means of expressing ourselves." - Pamela Lu

Pricetags like old banners still stuck to my forehead:

1.) Re Rachel Blau du Plessis: There is a power negotiation inherent in the
"gender" deal: one which invades - alters, disrupts, includes - the dream
life (in my experience) & the writing.

2.) Re Brian Kim Stefans: There is a moment in your piece where "best
poets" and "woman poets" are rendered yet again as mutually exclusive
categories. Annoyingly and falsely as they ever were rendered so.

Tenants in a Drama Not of Own Devising, Or Even Illusion Of

Once again in David Lehman's *The Last Avant-Garde: The Making of the New
York School of Poets*, women are shelved upon the side, when there at all.
I admit to not knowing tons about the era and the place (apart from what
any red-blooded global citizen knows instinctively) (which is why I'm
reading the book, alongside a much more hilarious account, *The Golden
Spur*, a fiction by Dawn Powell), but forgive me if I find it strange that
listed as the key players are the group of four men - Ashbery, Koch,
O'Hara, Schuyler - with Barbara Guest included in the list about every 2nd
or 3rd time the group is so invoked.  (Not terribly shockingly, Guest
doesn't get her own chapter - that would be too confusing?)  Even more
troubling is the rendition of poor Jane Freilicher, a painter given a few
establishing shots in order to portray her "pithy" personality (she reads
like Margaret from "Dennis the Menace", or an early Shirley MacLaine
character) that the men found so muse-worthy. And I do find it rather odd
that whilst so much in Lehman's book is made of these gentlemen's
"homosexuality" and openess to "heterodox ideas" the muse is so central to
the author's (and authors' - ? -) configuration of a basis to their writing
- the idea of the muse being, need I say, rather "hetero" and "ortho" -

An instructor (Sarah Parker) I had as an undergraduate was researching the
history of Cherokee women. Reading the Europeans' early records of several
meetings with ambassadors from the tribe (nation) she found that whilst the
people were recorded as male statesmen, descriptions of the garments and
ornaments they wore sounded an awful lot like traditional women's wear
(Parker had studied the "anthropology", aka the fashion).  Her theory was
that the European men couldn't even take in the fact that the Cherokee
"allowed their women" this type of power and citizenship. Mine: oops, how
much more easily the pronoun "him" slips off the quill. And so on,
histories are - often - lost.*

* Here I recommend 5 books:
Dale Spender, *Mothers of the Novel*
Joanna Russ, *How to Suppress Women's Writing*
Gillian Hanscombe & Virginia L. Smyers, *Writing for Their Lives*
Paula Gunn Allen, *The Sacred Hoop*
Jimmie Durham, *A Certain Lack of Coherence*

Miss Timeless Yet Stylized Ornate

Monsterfuck, butcherslut, wholesale reenactment with an umlaut as the New
Yorkers lately pose; the orchard of mother in single time, disinhabiting
the ones you love as you lie on the turnstile, rocky beach sandy-haired,
sideline's clutter. The thing itself or some other unapproachable notion of
it lies below. Separacism. Schizaplenty boombox, work it.

Write stones inscribe the body and inscribes the body writing about sex.
The body takes through my !

A liberation of sexuality not only from reproduction but also from "dry"
sex; for certainly one of the reasonable uses of social dancing is the
"history" of another's body, the instability it occasions - that "option"
of sex, of marking the body. This body has been raped and writes "A
physical body writes about sex."

hardly any of us could be taken in by this, the body of air, what hearing
:writing it. It goes back to the sexually fucked-up catastrophe of naming
-:materiality; the challenge is for writing to embody the body without:of
the computer, which is a body, writing about its sex, immobilized,
in:turmoil within. This body works and doesn't work, is faceless, and has
splayed open for you. You write in its walls; you come/cum online you stop
writing, start wryting, you type
zjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss you type
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh you type
dksjssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssjjjjjj ikonic sizzle you type
with lag sudden stop your screen freezes

Don't know exactly where "my" body is in writing-- but as a fountain pen
scribbling across paper, a body writes about sex. It inscribes sex and
inscribes the body and inscribes the body writing about sex. The body
takes away, erases, the inscription, having sex. I'm working towards a
writing that subverts sexuality, a writing returning the repressed,
turning it. Not the tidy container or body of "writing" but the clinical
strokes of sex/body/writing standing for an absence of names resonating
deeply, exhausted, emptied of all affect.

no name or container no channel but flow meandering among, holding myself
rigid like a natural kind, holding myself open like a signifier, labia
mouthing nothing of language, of "emptied of all affect" precisely in-
scribed on the body of the slave, of which culture turns about

Your assertion names my of the computer, which is a body, writing about
its sex, immobilized, in! assertion with ideogrammar

thy grammyr whych maykes ytself, grammyr whych tumblys blyss of lyngage

I'm having no problems with transgressive writing - a body of bodies a
body of scents and this other body, the imprint of others, short-lived,
they shall lose their names, which were short-lived. Once this body
appears in writing, it is no longer this body - hence the body contact and
sometimes sexual foreplay. I'm having no embarrassment over or within or
devouring bodily fluids, from the body unhoused, transgressed.

you can buy me hence th'contract; you can buy us hence th'exhibition; you
can buy them hence culture; you can dissolve us; take out th'eyes/I's of
th'Mitannian prisoners of war

There's no sexual bragging, no description of interest. She writes, con-
cerning the sexual chain of material/energy exchanges, like a transformer
which always already champions the vulnerable, fractured, the disenfranch-
ised. Sex is an option performance; the body has no discourse, no discur-
sive content to be realized. This body has been crushed, and has no name.
Do I have a body? Does an animal?

do we celebrate, serrate body against body, rub raw labia and labia, cere-
brate th'privilege of lost control, of pure display among th'dis/eased

Have it doubled, tripled, mixed sexuality of everything all ways, a dream
sex come forth polymorphous perverse after the oedipal. Give me toxicity;
notice how the body quickens in forage, fucked-up, a female body having
sex with another Australian female body, smearing the screen with menses,
typing with me in ytalk. Reading debris through the debris. No way can it
be stood against the gaze; it was her son taped the whole thing; I met
him later there at the conference. Sex was nature; they were feral, living
in the bush w/ others south of the city. Enjoy them immersed in sounds, in
the recurrence of bodies.

y lyved yn thy syth yf thy cyty, "Would you please recite the Sutra, as I
cannot read it myself." (Hui Neng.)

Tt is the recurrence of this body language, this "set of experiences" -
words that others might deem horrible, ask for names, I won't give them.
Look at what might be deemed vulnerable, slipping in the night - writing
is more than words having sex, night-sex, against the fractured and
disenfranchised, choreography of the body or its lack, of orientation, of
insides against or among outsides, or their lack thereof.

when fucking intersperses themselves among thine words, layerings readyng-
wrytyng thys, you will place your hands and fyngers there among the words
in thyse placys

I'm a node in the other, interspersed among they're language, are we? Not
to perform or mince words, they don't, yet they're pierced, have a tattoo,
ARE. The poem's not it, nor is poly-sexual or semantic pose a prose in too
many anecdotes. So the abstraction of the "body" is a thereof, therefore
is a therefore.

"Please recite, please stop speaking in quagmire, please: operative."

"17 rm h hh 18 grep body gg > h 19 wc h 20 grep trans gg >> h 21 grep
language gg >> h 22 wc h 23 grep sex gg >> h 24 wc h 25 sort h > gg; rm h;

To regain privacy, I have sexualized myself, stiffened in public, useless
male scrawled across others - referents, dialects, valencies, fissures,
separations, slidings-across, and refusing to give up the pre-discursive.
The body comes forth from its abstraction, because she's transgressive
without bragging, that writing that champions the vulnerable and frac-
tured. Phallacy, no phallic or gizmo, juxtaposed with shape and juice.
The body who has sex enjoys the stance of the body who has sex, although
there's some twilight here. The body's a catachresis knowing specific
materialtiy; the challenge is for writing to embody the body without
writing it. It goes back to the sexually fucked-up catastrophe of naming -
hardly any of us could be taken in by this, the body of air, what hearing
is, what speaking is for, and around, that matter.

The computer, a body, writes about sex. The keyboard and monitor are part
of the computer, which is a body, writing about its sex, immobilized, in
turmoil within. This body works and doesn't work, is faceless, and has
been grabbed, natural and deformed. Think of it as a human, faceless and
maybe what could or would be meant by transgressive.
